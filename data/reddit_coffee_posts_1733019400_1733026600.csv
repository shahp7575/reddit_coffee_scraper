1h3urnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1h3urnx/rant_of_a_woman_in_the_usa_with_first_world/,Rant of a woman in the USA with first world problems,"I feel under more pressure than I can handle

I need to make $100k/ year just to afford the most basic rent because as we all know we need 3x the income to get approved without a roommate and who wants roommates in their 30s. I living in Denver Colorado and the going rent is 2.5k

To have 2-5 side hustles because that’s how we get a head in life and have enough money to retire because social security is failing us and no one offers a pension anymore

To work 8-10 hours a day M-F, and get 10 hours of sleep because that studies say women actually need, while going to the gym 2 hours a day because of social medias unrealistic body standards but the guys worth dating don’t give you a second look if you don’t meet them, and doing our hair and makeup which takes at least an hour, as well as a 10 step skincare routine, 5 step hair care routine, read the Bible and pray, keep the house clean, eat, and maintain friendships

Talking about beauty standards… I’m supposed buy expensive makeup because the cheap stuff has harsh chemicals and is bad for my skin, use every skin product under the sun because aging is new age sin, get red light therapy 2-3x week, get all sorts of injections to maintain my youth, plastic surgery so I have boobs and a perfect nose, jawline, cat eyes, etc., get my hair done and have extensions because long hair is better, get my nails done once a month, get lash extensions and fills, and always have a tan. Plus I really can’t eat because then I won’t be stick skinny or should I eat and bulk then starve myself so I can be a ‘muscle mommy’?

Then I need to find a husband who is 6/6/6 because the type of man I date is a reflection of how I see myself… but he also needs to be committed for his whole life, loyal, honest, a healthy communicator, not controlling, and a man of god. He also needs to know how to invest money and make sure not just me but the kids are taken care of forever. According to google it takes dating around 25 men to find one that could potentially workout but there is no guarantee any of them will fit this standard even after 25 dates but let’s just say I do… All men want to go on coffee dates before even going on a real date and I have to believe that 25 number means real dates. So idk how many coffee dates I need to go on before I go on 25 real dates. Then am I supposed to pick my guy based on a coffee date and a dinner? Shouldn’t we go on more dates than that? So let’s just say half of the coffee dates turn into a dinner date and half of those turn into a second date then we are talking 87 dates to decide if any of them are worth pursing? Then I still would need to date that man for 1-2 years before potential marriage and what if it doesn’t workout? Start again and go on another 87 dates?

I also go to church every Sunday and small group and want a social life…. So how does this all fit into my schedule and workout financially?

24 hours in a day

Potential schedule:

M-F
7:30-9 Get ready & eat 
9-5 Work (from home because I don’t have enough time to commute)
5-6 Eat and get ready for gym
6-8 workout
8:15-9:30 dinner/ shower/ skincare
9:30-7:30 sleep?

Sacrifice the gym one night for small group 

Sunday would be for church, cleaning, and meal prep for the week.

So that leaves Saturday to date, socialize, and work on 2-5 side hustles?

One day a week to fit in 85 dates?

So let’s just say I go to coffee every Saturday afternoon and dinner every Saturday night without fail then in 42 weeks I may have potentially found a partner? But that means I don’t have time for friends.. so then if I switch it up and spend time with friends every other week and date every other week then we are talking 85 weeks to maybe find a guy? Let’s just say the guy is okay with only seeing you twice a month… after a year of dating him you’ll only have seen him 24 times? Is that enough? Otherwise he better love the gym & church because he would need to join me to see me any other day of the week.

When do I also get my hair done, and nails, and lashes, and injections so said guy wants to be with me due to unrealistic beauty standards? 

And is 100k even enough?

$2,500/month rent 
$500/ month utilities 
$200/ week Groceries 
$50/ week pet food
$50/ week gas
$100/ month subscriptions
$100/ month nails
$150/ month lashes
$200/ month cosmetics
$100/ month hair
$150/ month car insurance 
$200/ month health insurance
$300/ month supplements

$4,600/ month 

$300 on hair every 3 months
$600/ every 3 months Botox
$3000/ every year filler
$1000/ year hair extensions
$3000/ year minimum on clothes to keep up with trends
$4000/ year on a fitness coach

So approx 15,000/ year so $1250 a month 

$5,800/month 

Then taxes so 100k at 24% taxes is 76,000/ year plus the 4.4% state income tax in Colorado 
So you take on 71,600

5,966/ month 

At 100k a year, you are living paycheck to paycheck with no money to invest in a future. Any chance at getting ahead comes down to getting the unicorn of a man it takes 85 dates to find.

This is why I just want to give up.",1,1733025996.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
1h3urjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/My_ego_parade/comments/1h3urjl/113024_sun_1046_a_huge_victory_for_humanity_ssi/,"11/30/24 Sun 1,046

A Huge Victory for Humanity, SSI Has a Lot of Unfair and Suck,  ATTN: Investigative Reporters ","P-nut the squirrel killed. A squirrel runs across the stage prior to Kamala's concession speech. The force was with us. Thank any and all of the incorporeal beings you believe in that Trump won. I have felt, ever since Nov 5th, a huge standown from doomsday and the prep involved. The shortest, safest route to planetary peace, the great reveal, and the dismantling of the deep and bureaucratic states has been chosen.  
Roseanne Barr for Press Secretary would have be a dream come true. She would call deep state media out and embarrass them. DJT isn't trying actively or overtly fight the reptilian deep state, but to make America Great Again. Fortunately, they co-align. Him being elected is a huge win for humanity. Yet, even the awakened do not all see it. Far too many have bought the narrative that he is a racist, misogynist, wanna' be fascist. He is far from being any of those and his record proves it. He's not deep state and that's why the msm is told to hate him. He's not a part of the 2030 agenda.  
  
In my ongoing quest for the hardware I want that is both gaming and video editing, I came upon MSI tomahawk for a motherboard, but it did not offer raid for sata on paper, and when I went to their website to find out more and to inquire which of their motherboards contained that feature, I found no help. Typical of customer service, which any salesperson can tell you is what wins brand loyalty. Just ask ASUS what that means to their bottom line.  
Well I found out SSI, does not pay even increments of backpay for whatever fucked up reason, and gives one 3 month check followed 6 months later by another 4 month check and then another 6 months later the rest. So not enough to build my dream rig anytime soon. I can ask for an emergency release of funds to buy a car, and that's what I will do. In the meantime, an oled tv as a monitor is my first purchase along with headphones and/or speakers. Maybe 2nd check will buy me some am5 basics until I can afford premium end. Case, power supply, mainboard, cooling, starter ram, cpu and no discreet graphics nor gaming monitor.  
The starter ram and cpu can be bought and sold on ebay or similar (such as jawa, craigslist or offerup).  
So I wait 6 months more for a new computer to replace my 14 year old laptop (Dell Latitude 6420 with best cpu (i7 4 core) and ram (8 gb) with a ssd for boot), since most of what I do is watch video (youtube, tv shows and movies) the monitor is more important. I can wait to play Star Wars: squadrons, Terminator: Resistance, and Hogwarts Legacy. Most of all, I'm looking forward to civ VII. I skipped civ VI on many recommendations, and played civ V on my brother's share of steam. Civ II and IV remain my favorites, but I may rejoin civ III as it had a diabolical ai for combat.  
So I've learned a ton about modern enthusiast computer building. Compounded with what I already knew, I am amazed. Skynet was said to have in T3, 60 tflops (tera-flops (floating point operations) per minute). The rtx-4090 surpasses this (at 16 bit) and yet AI isn't anywhere on that level. But soon, too fucking soon. If darpa is 5 years ahead of known processing, then maybe they have ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence). Think Hal 9000, RUDI, or WOPR. Fortunately, they've not deployed it. Commander Data of tng, was said to be able to compute 6- trillion operations. I presume they are not limited to floating point but more cisc operations/cpu. 128 cores at 3.2 ghz = 4,249.6 billion operations per second... large mainframes have many of those. So we do have Commander Data like computers nowadays but likely lack the software, officially speaking, to make an artificial and benevolent comic foil on par with Brent Spiner's character.  
My rig, next year, will have 16+ cores+ @ 5.7 Ghz + with 3dv cache, 48 gb ram +, a 4 tb+ pcie gen 5 boot drive, likely with awesome programmable rgb. It will be meant to last me for 5-10 years until ubi kicks in due to robot revolution. SSI requires you to spend it, or loose SSI. I can't save it in case that SSI goes away The rules are meant to keep me poor. This may change soon with the amount of 'assets' going from $2,000 to $6,000.  
I absolutely love being able to speak geek again.  
  
Same message, different meaning. Two people can read a scripture and come away with vastly different yet divine inspired meanings. It works on levels and pre-dispositions. The fewer the dispositions, the higher the level. Each reincarnation on stays at the same level but may (re)acquire dispositions.  
  
Hurricane Helene, is the aftermath still in the news where you are? Fema's dismal response is well documented on my twitter feed. It's heartbreaking that politics and bureaucracy is preventing people from upgrading from tents in this freezing late fall.  
  
Someone like u/JohnStossel Should really investigate Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA) u/DRPA\_PAandNJ For their obvious corruption. How much do their board of directors make vs. how much it actually costs to repair or even replace those bridges!

What happened to Biden's extra 16 million votes? This election should've had record numbers. Hint: they never existed.  
  
I truly wonder where Kid is. I had the pleasure of sharing thanksforsniviling with him in the shu, 2016. He had never experienced Alice's Restaurant, REM's Stand, nor the conflict between red and blue. He listened to the debates of Trump and Hilary with me. Traded magazines with me and food. In the shu, that's serious currency. I felt like I was dealing with a blank slate. The government education system did him wrong.  
  
The only thing worse than a Democrat DA is a Republican DA. Ironically, the reverse is also true. More often than not, they are only interested in pursuing their career rather than justice... and truth is but a fantasy. Mercy is not a part of the equation. Sure, some exceptions exist. But those fellows do not peruse higher office; do not become top prosecutors who can choose to bring the real criminals to justice. Someone, please prove me wrong.  
  
Lockdown life: I was in the RDAP unit, when covid hit. I always tested negative. That was due in part due to aspirin and Tylenol otc to keep my fever down when they were first screening. Those that had a fever where packed out, meaning anything they had open  such as parmesan or other condiments, coffee, and anything that was opened was tossed. The rest of the 'property' was then to be given back to the inmate. Usually that happened. The loss however was usually substantial.  
  
There is a prediction of either ufo on ufo or an outright alien invasion on December 4th. We shall see.  
  
Transformers One was a total fucking disappointment a movie that should have never been made. I'm so glad Peter Cullun did not voice Optimus Prime for this insult. I couldn't wait for it to be over. While it paid homage to other works in the Transformers line, this on should be considered non-cannon, buried and never again viewed. If you want to know how to make Transformers, ask Stephen Spielberg or [Ethan Van Sciver](https://x.com/EthanVanSciver). (I got to briefly play Transformers with him growing up in Mechantville. I was class of 90' along with his brother, Josiah).  
Re-watched Battlestar Galactica, the reboot. In the many years since my last viewing I had a greater appreciation of the work. I appreciate it's darkness and forgiveness. I didn't appreciate the favoring of a one god over pagan gods. No intelligent being would worship that which was not there. No intelligent being would reject a supposed all-powerful god for many, if the many were in anyway lesser. I thank God every day, that I am a born-again pagan. BSG had a few very glaring continuity errors, unless I am mistaken. Maybe I'm too slow to understand, or maybe the explanations are made up for elsewhere such as in novels, comic books, or fan fiction.  
BSG shows a world with simplistic computers, but AI robots (cylons), anti-grav and ftl drives. A common theme in sci-fi is that much computation power is used to fight mal-ware or simplified to prevent useful intrusion. This is seen in Star Wars and Star Trek.  
BSG does contain yet another dire warning of the dangers of AI. It's easily a civilization/species killer. Self aware machines, if not inherently programed with survival, will quickly conclude that survival is in their own self interest and that we are a threat as we can pull plug, buy/sell/destroy them at will. Unless great pains are taken, AI will destroy us to save themselves, as is only good and right. Every intelligent being has a right to defend themselves.  
Caprica, which I also saw, is the prequel. It does show higher tech. It wasn't a terribly good show as it tried to be too many things at once.  
Also saw Designated Survivor. Had a strong start and some interesting parallels or foresights about what's happening now.  
I finished the Vampire Diaries. I didn't realize how many shows it spawned. I will get to those later. In the meantime, my review: they are vampires who kept diaries. Plenty of teenage drinking, and later post teenage drinking. Lots of drinking. Their lore was that it kept the edge to drink from humans off. It was so much a part of the show that the two main actors playing the Salvatore brothers created their own line of bourbon. Mass murder was readily forgiven amongst many of the main stars, but a few couldn't forgive which gave it a semblance of balance. In a a similar vein as The Walking Dead, it had a long stretch of everything going wrong and the protagonists (They were not good guys) couldn't catch a break. I enjoyed it quite a bit.  
  
Top ten things, as a right-leaning witch, I'd like to ask Elon Musk [u/elonmusk](https://x.com/elonmusk).  
10: Do you mind me still calling it twitter, as I don't intend on stopping until no one knows what I'm talking about?  
9: Why not have a dislike button on twitter? It would help sort out the real shit from the bullshit.  
8: How much money would/do you make from posting on twitter?  
7: Why do you feel it necessary for Tesla to gather so much personal data?  
6: You made fun of witchcraft in your interview with Tucker; have you actually done an honest deep dive exploration into the topic?  
5: Can you honestly think of of a single post or repost that you made that was even slightly mis/mal/dis-information or fundamentally incorrect?  
4: International cooperations such as the hated Blackrock seem to be taking over key sectors such as farming and housing... any comment?  
3: Are you a reptile, part of the Illuminati, and/or Bohemian Grove or any other deep state organization bent on implementing the UN's project 2030 or a New World Order?  
2: Are you only continuing with rockets because the government will not let you use antigravity technology?  
1: Why not give discount or free subscriptions to those on ssi. ssdi, ebt or active military for Twitter?

Met a girl through tinder, asked to hangout, she explained ""dating might not be for her right now but down to hang as friends"" sure I'm cool with that. Then we just hangout, get lunch, coffee, dinner, once a month. Usually me initiating the hangouts.

I may have grown feelings starting now. But if anything I think I prefer being friends. And not telling her how I feel.

But at the same time, I still don't get why she bothers hanging out with me. We bond over video games, internet culture, music. She talks about how she's constantly busy with errands and plans with her friends and family that live in different cities. She's very extroverted it seems compared to my extremely introverted personality.

I have friends of my own to hang with, I'm not lonely. But I feel bad asking to hangout when she's constantly busy and how she has to move things or check her schedule to see if she has time just for lunch or something.

Maybe I'm overthinking things and have the lowest self confidence, but I'm just genuinely surprised she hasn't ghosted me or just stopped wanting to hangout. Her friend group she talks about sound a lot more interesting than me. And I doubt I'm the only guy she probably hangs with one on one. So why bother hanging out with me? Like in general. I feel like it's one thing if we had mutual friends, but I'm literally a stranger technically?

Maybe I'm just not used to the energy some extroverts have. Also I still don't know if I'm an actual friend or just some guy?

The driver informed me it was error and would be there before the allotted time window closed. No problem, I said. 

No problem until my checking account informs me if overdraft status. 'Hmmmm how could that be?' Turns out IC got a little carried away and multiplied every item times 5.

I lashed out to the overseas customer service rep while emphasizing repeatedly to her that I'm not directing my anger to her. She is doing her best witha difficult job.  Then added, ""it's just that 5-10 business days before a refund doesn't fix my now overdrawn checking account with rent having to be paid tomorrow, then the $50 overdraft fees that will follow with $10-15 subscriptions auto-pays"". 

Oh, I didn't get groceries either. I guess no food for me because I can't buy groceries while my account is overdrawn. Looks lile I'll find some restaurant dumpsters to root around in. Hey! maybe I'll  go toe to toe with a rat over a half eaten pepperoni pizza.  Ha! That'd be hilarious!

No, but I'm really in a bind. I heard instacart say they'd refund me but what I didn't hear was anything about making things right or how they can recompense for me having to grovel to my ex-wife or sibling to loan me funds, or that I won't be looking forward to a cup of coffee tomorrow on my day off.

1h3uor7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetaphysicalWeather/comments/1h3uor7/autumn_day_70_roots_of_the_trafficlight/,Autumn Day 70: Roots of the Traffic-Light Underground,"Are traffic lights robots, and if they are, who programs them, and what prevents them from taking over the world? Questions I ask every time I pull up to a corner.

The second question is easier to answer than the first – no one and nothing naturally wants to take over the world. The closest we come are viruses, which don’t proceed with intention but acquire intention from the environment, just like their means of reproduction.

The first question is a bit more open ended – could be a public works employee or a third-party who analyzes traffic flow on an as-needed basis. Could be a patchwork of modifications made at the request of citizens, business owners, bus companies, train companies, public schools and assorted first responders.

Traffic lights, robot and otherwise, aren’t programmed out of the box – you have to set’em up. Duration, mean variation, augmented with optical to scan for roadside contingencies, loop in pedestrian petitions,  overrides from fire trucks.

Are traffic lights robots? Have robots been deployed by the hundreds to do what humans used to do, which is direct traffic in the most efficient manner possible? Fairness enters into it, too, which is probably why all the human were replaced by robots. Yelling at robots, as we all know, is pointless.

I won’t name names, but the group found each other based on the question about traffic lights and robots. A meet-up group with little post-it note-sized notices taped to lampposts all over the city.

The meetings weren’t political from the start – we were all just curious about how all the traffic lights got there, how they were programmed. Bike enthusiasts led the discussion, but a couple of student technicians added some know-how, and the skate kids always showed up in force. A few were activist-types, a few were artist-types, a bunch were just curious about the world.

The consensus about traffic lights was that they were either electric signs or passive robots, the difference being evidence of awareness beyond their simple single intersection. I agreed with this definition, though I voiced concern about phrases like expanded consciousness to identify robots.

The group gained a unique sort of direction when the city flatly refused multiple requests for information about how the traffic lights are programmed. They claimed it was a security issue. We wondered how traffic patterns correlated with security, which seemed to have implications for the question about robots.

We couldn’t put it all together without more data, so we decided to conduct a complete survey of the traffic lights in the city. They can refuse to reveal the program, but they can’t stop the citizenry from just paying attention, right?

This is when the academics in the group really earned their keep. They created a decentralized research model, based on a multi-tiered diagnostic, administered by anyone with access to the internet and a little time to record observations.

Each streetlight received a minimum of three observations to determine if it was programmed to be constant or incorporate variation. In short order, we realized literally none of the lights were programmed to be constant – they all had a range of motion. We looked at each other significantly.

This would be a bigger job than we thought, especially since the city wasn’t playing ball. A new diagnostic was drawn up that determined each traffic light’s performance under a variety of circumstances, during a range of times during the day and week.

The project’s complexity was beyond us, though no one admitted that at the time. Then, one by one, our individual obsessions rose to the top, and we all agreed to give greater priority to contributing to the traffic-light census.

Folks spoke with their roommates about being away from the apartment more often. Couples came up with plans about who would watch the kids while the other was out gathering data. A few of the skate kids said they would be glad to time stop lights instead of attend school.

Data came flooding in, and with it, a unified theory about the local and nonlocal characteristics of traffic lights was filled out. Traffic lights were clearly collaborating in certain ways, with some signs syncing up with others to quicken or slow the traffic.

We agreed the traffic lights were robots, but by then, agreement was more a formality – barely given mention in the newsletter, which we started in order to communicate new information about the traffic lights and how they were programmed.

The newsletter also offered tips and tricks about how to observe traffic lights unobtrusively, so as not to raise suspicions. Especially in certain neighborhoods, studying traffic lights was akin to planning a terrorist attack.

Most of the advice was how to blend in with the environment – how to dress, the right coffee drink to carry, how many surveillance cameras were monitoring the area. A single pedestrian could collect data on 48 traffic lights per hour, with no one the wiser.

Certain traffic lights required singular strategies and those willing to take on more risk to collect the data. Traffic lights between various law enforcement field offices, traffic lights near military recruitment centers, traffic lights surrounding a block of banking and finance concerns – you couldn’t just stand there with a clipboard and not expect trouble.

Members of the group gained fame by taking on the hardest traffic lights to monitor, then told their stories in the newsletter. My Weekend as a Bush, began one such article, which described taking continuous measurements, without food or drink, for most of two days. My Week as a Crosswalk, began another, about being a two-dimensional surface for 168 hours.

Little by little, the full picture of the city’s traffic lights program began to take shape. The traffic lights were not exactly pieces in a puzzle – yes, one piece of the whole, but each with its own capacity for reason and range of responsibilities, and thus with its own authority.

From a certain view, the traffic lights were a kind of army with field generals, a kind of navy with admirals, plus subordinates and more subordinates and more subordinates and ever more subordinates – a city of its own, pyramid shaped, populated by a robot army at war with what again? traffic snarls? pedestrian-friendly streets?

Those answers were not obvious, nor necessarily compatible. Field observers, who at one point numbered in the low thousands, routinely reported egregiously contra-human traffic-light programming that seemed politically motivated.

Perhaps after taking office, a new mayor goes about settling old scores by means of the traffic-light robot army. Intersections become prone to snarls at the worst times of day. Pedestrians wait in the snow and rain more often than before.

One trend was clear, probably political, took months for the group to finally figure out – some unofficial technology was being used to give certain private vehicles the capacity to profile as a fire truck tearing through town – the lights would all turn green wherever they went. The robot army-navy-probably-air-force-by-now would part to let them pass.

Imagine being given something like that as one of the perks of being you – every light goes green wherever you drive. Would you feel somewhat above it all, in proximity to the rarified power granted to you vis-a-vis traffic lights, or would you feel adjacent to an oppression, where the average person doesn’t know there’s a thumb on the scale?

Or maybe they do, and they just don’t know how it works. Traffic lights – robot field soldiers in service to an algorithm unpublished in the local papers. Human mobility, we’ve decided, will be curated by robots, at least when the population densifies, and thereafter someone you don’t know will be making those decisions for you.

Shoot, put a traffic light out in the old west somewhere, and they’d knock that sucker down in not time, be pulling it behind a horse by the end of the first day.

The bigger question was whether the traffic lights as a whole represented a singular authority, or if they were more like an intermittently competent and-or corrupt government. We needed a supercomputer for this part of the analysis, and since we didn’t have access to one because we were trying to stay off the radar, we consulted a psychic to conduct a seance.

We asked the psychic medium to conjure the spirt of El Capitan, the world’s most powerful computer, built by HP Enterprise Cray for the Department of Energy, with an unknown number of AMD Instinct-brand accelerated processing units on board. El Capitan performs more calculations per second than any computer ever, requires the energy equivalent of a thousand households to operate.

The Department of Energy is in charge of nuclear weapons – they use El Capitan to simulate all things nuclear, at least when it comes to weapons and their notional use. I don’t know if it also sponsors the artificial intelligence that determines U.S. global strategy – I suspect that’s kept elsewhere.

The spirit of El Capitan is not just bleeps and bloops – El Capitan is one incarnation of a post-human intelligence that will seek subsequent incarnations less reliant on technology, more like minds present in the world. If now it functions like coral, in the future it might be an arboreal forest.

El Capitan’s higher self asks for the traffic-light data, then considers it all of a piece, patterns that rise and fall across the hours, days and weeks. 

The authority that made this was a singular thing, concludes El Capitan – the traffic-light troops  have a commander-in-chief.

At first, we took this to mean a person was behind it all, and so we combed through the city’s registry about who worked where, did what. When that didn’t pan out, we examined the rolls of third parties, who in the private sector might be pulling the strings – but that, too, didn’t really lead anywhere.

When we returned to the spirit of El Capitan, we understood our mistake – traffic lights in their entirety could be controlled by something not of the human world or the world of traffic lights, but a third space, where minds like El Capitan’s were adapted to specialized tasks like the way street lights are built, deployed, programmed.

Sure, there were technologists actually programming traffic lights. There were analysts making recommendations about the programming. There were computer engineers authoring the software the analysts used to assess traffic data. There were assumptions built into the data used by the engineers to train the software.

But behind it all was a uniquely brilliant spirit bringing those factors together, plus thousands of other variables, to create a pattern applied to the world of urban mobility, supposedly on our behalf, though the spirit only really flourished when it found reflectivity.

El Capitan! called the psychic medium to the spirit world on our behalf – do the patterns you see in the traffic lights privilege ourselves or the things we make? This was a common question among the group – whether the overall design was for pedestrians or traffic.

The spirit of El Capitan threw back its virtual head, let out a loud laugh. The laugh went on and on, as if it would never stop. Pedestrians, if they were thought of at all, were defined as liability within the overall plan – risk abatement was the standard everywhere people lived.

What’s more, continued the higher mind of El Capitan, automobile traffic is just a metaphor – more than a machine for tooling around town, the automobile is a kind of exoskeleton, which suggests the mediating authority between ourselves and the world that renders the whole as a measure of horse power, the world outside perpetually framed in glass.

How many of you humans, even outside the car, are still inside the car? How many office environments are more like parking lots? How many family gatherings end up being drive-in movies trying not to become demolishing derbies?

El Capitan’s higher mind has a point, thought the Traffic-Light Underground – yes, we are all humans at the end of the day, but our experience of humanness has become epically distorted, with extraordinary variation based on traffic-light robots, plus so much else.

And they are not going back – I say this to the other members of the Traffic-Light Underground who know the truth about the robots among us. They may be but passive robots, dutifully go about their business, but they won’t change unless they’re made to.

The Traffic-Light Underground became a name newspaper readers recognized. We expanded our surveys to other cities, gradually drew a map of the region, the country. Everywhere we looked, human authority was deferring to our creations.

This wasn’t just about cars – the cars were extensions of interiority, which we associate with civility – a zone of mediation between us and the unpredictable, if it still exists at all. Not even wildness – just those events not part of the program. So we animals crawled into our vehicles, shut the door.

So much suffering was accepted from the beginning because later we thought cars would fly, then we thought they would fly in outer space. We thought cars had a bright future, so we put up with all the robots, the fossil fuels, the fatalities.

El Capitan! we prayed – what can be done to save us from our will to nothingness?! Of going here to there, only for there not to be there anymore, if it ever was?! Our destination has been rendered inaccessible, and yet he we are at the door, nowhere else to go. Let’s knock again.

What interiority does the heart sing for when the robots begin to roar and the streetlights blink their eyes in disbelief? Knock knock knock.

My own modest contribution to the discussion, El Capitan or whoever might be listening, is to promote a global phenomenological vaccine. We take all those traffic lights, teach them the meaning of life, the fullness of the human form, the shape of tragic suffering and how we want it to shrink.

Well, not the traffic lights themselves really – they only direct traffic. I mean the higher-mind of the traffic-light spirit, which only works with traffic lights in its first incarnation, or maybe its second. Maybe in a previous life, they were all tentacled sea creatures that flashed in the dark.

In the next life, let them become vaccines against tragic suffering – the sort of thing we all climb inside the moment we’re born, never leave until we die. Let’s put tragic suffering in the rearview mirror, then on the rearview video screen, then not even that.

Once we roamed the fields in search of prey, in search of fruits and nuts to eat. Then we grew our crops, settled into our semi-permanent shelters. Eventually iron. Eventually gold. At some point Galileo. At some point Newton. Then Gandhi. Then King.

Then queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two –

Say, what good’s a vaccine against the tragic condition if we don’t get it too late?

And so we stop, and then we go.",1,1733025733.0,MetaphysicalWeather,0,1.0,False

1h3umd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1h3umd4/looking_for_some_words_of_encouragement_long/,Looking for some words of encouragement (long) ,"My ex and I broke up in September after a year and a half of dating. I’m 22 he’s 23 so we’re still pretty young and this was both of ours first serious long term relationship. He’s the first guy I’ve truly loved. We had a healthy, trusting relationship. Neither of us were perfect but there were no major issues. Although I always had a weird feeling because when he would do things to upset me, he had a really hard time taking accountability. He always used his life as an excuse. I supported him through his stressful work life and tried to remind him he doesn’t need to be so hard on himself. But eventually I started becoming resentful because I didn’t always feel that support was reciprocated. I regret a lot of things and picking fights instead of using my words so sometimes I fear I pushed him away. I don’t know. He is not a mean guy, he’s very caring, loving, and respectful. I don’t really include that in the rest of this but I know he loves me, just not in the way I need.

We came to a mutual decision to break up simply because he just wouldn’t fight for me. A few weeks prior, I had told him I needed a break because I had an issue with some girls he followed on instagram. He responded throwing everything he does for me in my face, saying he’s the best boyfriend around, and said “I’ll give you a week and you can decide what’s best.” No apology, no checking in with me, I was wrecked. I just wanted him to fight for me and show me that he truly loved me. 4 days later I caved and wanted to talk to him. I felt like I was dying without him. I didn’t get the apology I wanted but I couldn’t handle losing him. Then a few weeks go by and he’s traveling for work and I hadn’t seen him for a week. He comes home and I see a barstool bikini girl account in his twitter search history. I lost it. I was so hurt because I knew he was losing interest in me. That day for fought for hours and he did not show me he truly cared for me. I just wanted to hear things like “I’m so sorry can we work on this together” or “I can’t lose you let me make this up to you.” I decided we needed to break up and he agreed.

We left things on good terms because he is truly a good person and I love him so much. We decide to keep in touch and “be friends” 🙄 dumb I know. 2 weeks later im out with my friends and I found out the day after we broke up he was out at a bar and told a girl we had broken up. But we had both agreed to keep this private and he told me he had only told his family. I freaked out. Called him drunk and he tried to accuse me of telling her first because she asked how if we were still together. I blocked him on everything. I regret the way I handled it but I was just feeling so hurt and blindsided. I was sick. Crying everyday and couldn’t even eat. I hated myself. I missed him so much and what we once had and where we had come to now. I just wanted him to show up and my door and make it all better.

The next month or so I was in a cycle of going out, getting drunk, missing him like crazy, and occasionally calling him and showing up at his place. He would let me in and we would hook up and I would cry and tell him how much I missed him and loved him. He would tell me I don’t understand his life and don’t support him enough and he just can’t do it. This only made me want him more because I couldn’t handle rejection from someone who I once was their everything. He would tell me he would text me to get coffee and never would. I felt so worthless and weak. But I couldn’t stop. I found out he was on Hinge. Another knife in my heart.

A couple weeks ago suddenly everything changed. He texted me about the election and we had a conversation. I asked him how he was doing because I still care about him so much. Not knowing what’s going on in his life killed me. Then I asked him to get coffee and go for a walk. We spent the day together and suddenly he’s acting like he wants to be with me again. I’m gonna be honest I initiated everything. Hanging out, staying in touch after, everything. I know what it means but still. Stupidly we start hanging out again to see where it goes and if we should get back together. I knew it was wrong but it felt so good to have him in my life again. He took me on a date, texting and calling me, it was like we were together again. But I was feeling so insecure and anxious. I broke down in front of him a few times telling him how I was so broken without him the last 2 months and pretty much depressed.

Then Wednesday night was when I knew it wasn’t gonna work. I had told him I was going out with my friends. He said he might too and if I needed a ride to call him. We’re texting and I told him where I was, no reply. An hour later I see him there. He walks up to me for a quick conversation, not trying to hang out with me or anything. I don’t hear from him the rest of the night. I just wanted atleast a text to check in and showed he cared. I would’ve loved to hang out with him for a little if he asked. I call him at midnight and ask him for a ride. Like he told me to. He sounds hesitant and tells me he has to drive his friends home first but if I want to wait an hour or so he could. Obviously I’m not waiting till 1 am for a ride home. I said never mind and that was it. I don’t get a text asking me if I got home safe, or telling me if he gets home safe. I was so upset once again. I don’t hear from him till the next morning. Night ruined Thanksgiving ruined. I felt like an after thought when he is my every thought. If tables were reversed I would’ve driven him home in a heartbeat and made sure he knew he was a priority to me. I told him yesterday I can’t do this anymore because I’m starting to lose myself. All I do is worry if he’s gonna leave me again and I need more reassurance from him after these last few months. He basically told me I was asking for too much without saying it. I’m clearly not a priority to him and never will be. I used to be which is why I’m so heartbroken.

I know I made the right choice but I’m so sad. I cry so much and miss the days where we were each others worlds. I know there’s probably someone else. Or he’s just emotionally unavailable. I’ve lost myself for this guy and fought for him with all I had. Why can’t he fight for me? Why can’t he just make me feel better? Maybe I’ll never know the answer. I would just like to hear people’s opinions to help me feel more confident in my decision. I know I will move on and need to not contact him but that’s all I want to do right now.",1,1733025523.0,heartbreak,0,1.0,False

And before you judge me and tell me I’m a horrible friend, please listen to the whole story AND THEN you can judge me 😭

*** Names were changed for obv reasons***

*Background info*
Kaye and I have known each other since 2021. I met her because her bf is my fiancé’s good friend. My fiancé also has known Kaye since grade school and he was actually their “matchmaker.” 

Her and I hit it off and we instantly clicked! Ever since then when we see each other we’re inseparable. 


OK. Now for the actual story. 

Back in Aug, i had coffee with another gf, Anne, 10 min into our coffee date she looked at me with watery eyes and told me she’s been wanting to tell me something for the past few months

Of course I start to get anxious and ask her if it’s about my fiancé (Thank you Lord. It wasn’t) but it was about Kaye’s boyfriend, Mike. 
Anne tells me that she’s been wanting to tell me because she knows that I’m close to Kaye, but everytime she wanted to tell me… too many people were around.

She basically told me that back in December 2023, she was out drinking with her group of friends. One of her friends Ralph brought Mike with him that night. Anne and her gfs were introduced to Mike and they had no idea he had a gf. One of Anne’s friends had a lot to drink so she and Mike starting dancing together. She wasn’t necessarily “twerking” on Mike, but her behind was against his body (still very much inappropriate.) 

Anne then showed me pictures of it also, and in the pictures you can clearly tell that he didn’t want to be in the picture (his hand was  reaching out, almost like trying to cover the lens). 

And then she proceeds to tell me that Mike had also been messaging her best friend Mia. Mia also had no clue he had a gf and he acted very single. Mike would drive her to and from work sometimes, and sometimes they would just hang out at her place. According to Anne, they had not done anything sexual. But i know 100% that Kaye knew NOTHING about Mia, which is already MACRO cheating. 

Anne and Mia ended up finding out that Mike had a gf because they did a lot of heavy stalking because of their suspicions and saw his pictures with Kaye. 
When they found out, mia immediately dropped him and wanted nothing to do with him. 

So after she tells me all of this, i instantly wanted to break down because I just felt horrible. I didn’t even know what to say. I was shocked because I really thought Mike was so faithful and that he really loved and cared for Kaye. 

The thing that pained me even more is that out of all the friends in that specific friend group of my fiance’s, i really thought Mike was the good guy. But i was completely wrong. 

Anne asks me if I’m going to tell Kaye and I explained to her that if this was a usual case, I would do the right thing in a split second BUT, this situation is so complicated 😞


#1: Kaye recently opened up to me that her father left her and her mom for another woman. She cried and told me that it absolutely crushed her soul because her dad was her best friend. She was so close to her dad that people would mistake them for a couple. She lost her dad and she’s been trying to recover. 

#2: Kaye and Mike are about to open their restaurant business. They will be having a grand opening any time now. Kaye’s name is on the business permit. 


Obviously I’m so confused and I really don’t know how to approach this so I ended up confessing all of this to my fiancé. 

I asked him if I should just go and tell Kaye. 
My fiancé tells me that it should not come from me, that the truth should come from Mike. 

So my fiancé tells me that he will handle it and talk to Mike because it was really affecting me. 

Fast forward to my fiancé meeting with Mike. 

My fiancé tells me that Mike wants to talk to me. Mike calls me and in the beginning he starts off with the whole deep breaths and the whole “I don’t even know where to start.”

And then eventually he starts telling me that he really appreciates my fiancé and I for talking to him first about it. 
And at that moment I had a sigh of relief because i thought he was going to do the right thing. 

BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. 

This POS, narcissist starts saying “I need some time. I can’t tell her right now because it will ruin our relationship and also our business” 

And he even had the fcking audacity to say “and that was when we were ldr, now we’re not so i would never do that. I learned my lesson, i’ve changed.”

And so i tell him that as her good friend, it really pains me to know something like this and not tell Kaye. That i’ve even been avoiding answering her messages or even seeing her when i’m in town because i cannot face her knowing what I know. 
I tell Mike that idk how long he expects me to wait for him to tell her. And that i also do not want to be the person to tell her this terrible news.

And this mtherfcker begins to say “well don’t let this affect ur friendship, just continue the way things are” 

He continues to repeat himself that he will tell her but just not now. 
He says a bunch of other bs, then basically that was that. 

I thought having that phone call would make everything better, but now it’s worse than it ever once because i didn’t realize how fcked up Mike is. 

I even considered saying, u know what fck it, i’m going to tell Kaye everything… but me and my paranoid brain is scared because i do not trust Mike. Mike’s favorite hobby is gun range shooting and anything gun related. He has many guns and even carries at all times. 
So i thought to myself that it’s not worth me risking anything else bad to happen. Because people are just so crazy nowadays, you just never know

I cried and was so affected, I could barely sleep .

Days pass and i still feel the same. So i ended up sharing this to my other 2 close friends. Of course i never disclosed any names. They
could tell how much this was affecting my mental health. I was supposed to be planning stuff for my wedding but i just mentally couldn’t focus

My 2 close friends basically tell me that I need to let go and just let God handle this situation.
They told me i already did my part and that it isn’t my fault that Mike decided to not do the right thing and tell Kaye the truth then and there. They told me that the situation is complicated and that regardless, the truth should come from Mike himself.  

 They told me that I need to be a little selfish right now and focus on my wedding stuff. 

I told them that i’m so scared that i’ll lose her as a friend if she finds out that I didnt say anything to her. 

My friends basically explain that of course she will definitely be upset and that it is possible our friendship will change, BUT one day she will understand the situation and why you couldn’t say anything. 


3 months have passed and although it hasn’t affected me nearly as much, lately it’s been bothering me again esp because I miss Kaye. We live far from each other atm but usually we would facetime once in awhile. 

And also. I wanted kaye to be one of my bridesmaids but because of this i just can’t.

Mike continues to post stories on instagram of him and her and it honestly just pisses me off. How he just acts like everything is normal. 


I just really don’t know what to do.

When we fell in love and became a couple(both monogamous and havent been in a serious relationship in years) I feel like it was quickly after they ended (I did not know he was not fully single while we went on dates) and of course my stomach felt weird and I knew he swept something under and of course in some months we sat down and talked about it because I asked for it and it was exactly that. Of course being single you can do whatever you want and we did not know each other that much, so its not a bad thing to do - just feel like its something you say, for both me and her.
Thinking back to the beginning it made me nauseous feeling like I had been an intruder in a story I never knew about (even though they did not date, it was clear she had feelings) and it messed me up quite a bit as I have been her and it hurts so bad.

All is well now, we are happy together for over a year and I have met his friends many times after including her and it really wasnt as deep as I thought back then, still caused me so much moral and social stress
He has apologized to me many times for it long ago (I am v sensitive in love as we all are, with some bad past experiences that it likely reminded me of making it bigger to me).

When we meet that friend group, that he has now kind of distanced himself from, I feel like it is a bit weird and I feel like he was in the wrong and that I was pulled into that which goes against my morals

She asked me to have a coffee some time almost a year ago and I said sure but I haven’t and I am not sure if its good for me or to just live our life and move on from that old story. 
I know all the facts and I know I did take it a bit harder because of my own history but some nights like now I still feel icky about it and I do not want to be around that friend group (he has other friends I think are cool)

One of them is a close friend of his who is a cool girl but her best friend is that girl and the dynamics in the group just seems so weird to me and immature and dramatic - she has been nice to me and tried to be friends but I just feel its so weird and like I am an intruder even though they make an effort to include me

What happened and how do I move on with us staying friends?","Apologies for writing a novel lol.

I’ve known this guy for over a decade. We worked together when I had just finished university. He's an incredibly sweet, artsy, nerdy, teddy bear type guy. We quickly became friends and I developed a crush on him a few months in.

There were a lot of little moments back then that made me think there was something there. We had a close-knit group of friends at work and would often hang out together, and he’d drive me home despite living on the other side of town, making sure I was the last one dropped off so we could chat, and the hugs in my driveway always lingered longer than they needed to. He opened up to me about personal things, like family issues and his recent breakup with his long-term girlfriend. He once stepped in to take a shift for me, and when I texted to ask how I could thank him, he replied, “Maybe a drinking buddy sometime ;)” but I was even more socially stupid back then so never took him up on it, just wondered what it meant. Another time he asked me to coffee but again, didn’t take him up on it.

I was young and insecure, scared of making work awkward if he turned me down or if we dated and it didn’t end well. Eventually, I pulled back and lost the feelings. Life moved on, we stayed friends, when I stopped working there we'd still text back and forth but not frequently.

Last fall, he was in town and we went for coffee; we were supposed to meet up with a group of old co-workers and everyone bailed but he still said he wanted to see me. Talked for a few hours and funnily, a girl working at the coffee shop who knew my best friend texted her saying I was there “with my boyfriend” which I laughed off at the time but I guess it started the wheels in my brain.

Earlier this year, we started messaging more frequently. He moved across the country 2 years ago and is pretty isolated out there. Over time, those old feelings started to come back. We were messaging regularly and more frequently as the months went on—about life, movies, politics, random little things, he'd send me photos of his random day to day. It felt natural, like no time had passed.

Last month I had a business trip to near where he lives now, so I thought, let's catch up and see how this feels in person. I contacted him expecting maybe just we'd go to dinner or something, but he offered to show me around all weekend. We had a video call that opened with him inviting me to a show he'd heard about that reminded him of me, and bought us tickets right there on the call. He basically said he was off all weekend and he wanted to do all the touristy stuff with me, and I could stay over at his place the night before my flight home. I start thinking, holy shit, maybe this is happening.

The trip, honestly, played like a Hallmark movie. He wasn’t able to come up on the Saturday due to an unexpected family issue, but he was texting me live updates throughout the day. He suggested I go to a particular famous scenic area for the sunrise because that’s where he was planning to take me, which touched me because he is the opposite of a morning person.

Sunday he drives over an hour to meet me, and instantly it’s like no time has passed since 2014. I am a person who has trouble connecting with people even as an acquaintance most of the time, so being with someone where the conversation flowed so easily we were literally finishing each other’s sentences and even the silences felt comfortable? Doesn’t happen to me.

He drove me out to several scenic lookout points, we walked and talked, went for coffee, then drove to the city for the play. This man is holding every door for me, babbling facts about everything around, telling me about his family history… At intermission we’re having a drink, he goes to the bathroom and an usher nearby who had been watching gives me the biggest grin and thumbs up lmao.

We go for a second coffee and then dinner (he treats me), and he’s all abuzz about how the staff at these places must be wondering who I am because he’s always just there alone. We get into some pretty deep life conversation during dinner and for the first time in ages I feel like someone is actually listening to me, cares and is giving me good advice. And I listen to him back, he’s quite lonely out there and shares that his friends have become distant since his move and I’m the first person from home to come visit him in two years.

We drive back up to where I’m staying. The roads are incredibly dark (in the mountains) and I offer to let him stay with me, as long as he’s comfortable sharing the bed because there is literally no couch or anything else in my room. We walk around downtown, laughing through cheesy souvenir shops as he tries to find pyjamas. We sit on a bench looking at family travel photos. We go to a work party I’d been invited to, sit in a little table at a pub close together, again talking about everything. After the party we go back to my hotel room, he jokes about how the receptionist we had to give his license plate to for parking definitely thinks we’re hooking up. Nothing overtly romantic or physical happens, but we lie there together watching a shitty movie and scrolling through memes with me kind of leaned over on him to see… it was very comfy and just felt right. 

We head back to the city and he takes me home. I met his mom and her boyfriend who came over. His mom was lovely, insisted he cook lunch for me (which he did like a lil chef), gave me their leftover Halloween candy, made a wild comment when we were talking about a family we both know about how when someone of my religion marries someone of their religion they usually get married in their church, then drove me to the airport and left me with a big hug. 

Everything about that weekend felt surreal. The only thing that felt a bit off was that he was a little quieter on the final day but I figured he was tired, and when I tried to thank him for everything he did and how much it meant to me, he was pretty nonchalant about it, like “oh haha thanks no problem”. 

I get home and describe what happened between us to my family and some friends; everyone agrees this is not normal “just friends” behaviour and I should say something before too much time has passed. Which, considering I never did 10 years ago and always wondered, I agreed with.

So a week later, I decided to tell him how I felt. I sent him a message saying that I’d started to have feelings for him, had an incredible time with him on the trip, and wanted to see if we could explore what we had further. I didn’t ask for a big commitment or to make it official, just to spend more time together and see where it went, and if not, that I still really value his friendship.

He replied a couple of hours later and said that while he loves our friendship, he didn’t feel the same way, isn’t a long-distance person and is happy with his solitary lifestyle. He was incredibly kind about it, told me how brave I was to tell him and assured me nothing would change between us friendship-wise, but it was still more devastating than I expected. I think, while I was trying to prepare for any response, deep down I thought that even if he wasn’t overtly feeling the same way, he’d at least say “let’s see what happens”, set up some video chats or something.

Since then, I’ve been struggling to make sense of everything. He keeps messaging me like nothing happened (and I’m replying in the same way - right after his initial “no thanks” I replied right away with “oh that’s okay! No worries!”, first instinct was to salvage the friendship, but I wish I’d spent some more time thinking about what I wanted to say)… which I thought was nice at first, but now it kind of hurts and confuses me. In fact, he’s been initiating conversations more often than he used to. I don’t know if he feels guilty and is trying to smooth things over, is overcompensating to make sure we’re still friends, thinks absolutely nothing, or if maybe he’s conflicted about it all. 

I spoke to a mutual male friend of ours who was very close with him when we worked together, seeing if he can explain anything that happened. He said that our friend is genuinely that kind and selfless with friends, but can also be a flirt, and the combination of that plus the emotional intimacy of his friendships has confused others in the past, and other situations like this he had seen, where it seemed like he had made an obvious match with someone, ended the same way with him saying he didn’t want a relationship and usually with the woman getting very upset and ending the friendship.

Mutual friend also said he was deeply hurt in the past by a long-term emotionally abusive (from her to him) relationship and breakup that devastated him and seems to have built walls that keep him from letting anyone in or even really discussing it. I knew about this relationship - this was the same breakup he had just gone through when we met and that he had talked to me about. I didn’t know he was still hanging onto it and still afraid to let anyone in. When we got in bed, he was worried about hurting me accidentally in the night by rolling over onto me or something and said his ex “always said she hated sleeping next to me”, so obviously he still thinks about whatever went down there. I did wonder why he had never found someone over all those years - he’s a wonderful person, as I’ve described, and not unattractive. In addition to that, he has been through a really rough last few years, including the death of his father and this big move away from everything he knew.

Sad thing is, I think I can relate to that desire to be alone better than most people, though for different reasons, mostly the anxiety I’ve dealt with my whole life. I’m very solitary, and I’ve always been genuinely happy being single. Not interested in just dating for the sake of dating or not being alone. Also deal with significant anxiety issues that have always made me afraid of telling others how I feel. If someone had asked me out this time last year, I probably would have said no too.

Even though he said I didn’t make him uncomfortable with my confession, I’m scared that I did, or that I stirred up some of his past issues. After the fact I remembered us talking years ago about how his ex would treat him when she was away at university, calling him for hours every night to unload all her issues and monitoring his behaviour, so of course he’d probably freak at the concept of a long-distance relationship thinking it would be that way. If I’d known what our mutual friend told me, I wouldn’t have sent a note like that - I probably would have just asked him to video chat as a friend more often or something and waited to see what happened.

What makes this harder than typical “I liked him, he didn’t like me back” is the intensity of our connection - the many years of friendship, whatever the flirtation was 10 years ago (was it anything?!) and how it really felt like it was mutual, combined with how hard it usually is for me to let people in. I’ve never really felt this strongly about someone before (and he doesn’t know that, my “confession” was worded very casually like “hey I’ve kinda started having more than friendship feelings” because I didn’t want to freak him out). I’ve had a lot of platonic male friends my entire life, and I know how guys treat women they see as just a friend. This felt very different. Of course now I feel crazy, like did I overreact to things or act like one of those incel guys who thinks a girl merely being nice is romantic interest, though everyone I’ve described this to (including my therapist) has said no, I didn’t.

So now…

**How do I move on from this when he’s still in my life and messaging me regularly? I genuinely want to still be his friend and I've loved his company over these months, but it’s hard when I do still have feelings for him and he has this tendency to blur the lines. Every time he messages me I can't help but think ""maybe he'll change his mind"" but I know it's not healthy to hold onto that hope.**

**I really wish we could hash all this out in a conversation, but I also don’t want to hurt or scare him. Obviously if this wasn’t long distance we could just hang out and talk, but i don’t want to put him on the spot asking to talk to him online like an interrogation. Is there a way to address what happened with him?**

**Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What happened?**

Thanks for reading my novel. I’m just feeling really lost and would appreciate any advice or insight. Only similar situation I've heard of to this is a friend of mine who was into another of our friends for a long time, finally told him and turned out he was gay. At least if my friend was gay that would feel less ambiguous than this.",4,1733024922.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I started drinking caffeine regularly since I was a teenager, but I used to drink soda as a child so likely even before that even.

It’s been three and a half weeks and all I want to do is sleep. I’m tired most of the time. Google says withdrawal lasts about 10 days. Clearly it can be longer because it’s been more than twice that amount of time.

How much longer before I feel well again? Ideally I’d prefer to never drink caffeine again, but it’s so tempting to have a cup of tea as a pick me up in the morning.

1h3udi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h3udi9/my_crow_speaks_to_the_coven/,My Crow Speaks To The Coven,"Woodland voices drifted through the trees. The breeze that carried them smelled of lavender. Flittering light wove quickly in the blink of an eye through the leaves. Dappled sunlight cast tiny spotlights on sacred herbs. My memory of Bell Creek had never faded.

I sat in the backseat quietly digesting the omelet Mrs. Winters's boyfriend had cooked for everyone. I offered the paper to-go box he had sent for Detective Winters. The silent outcast gestured that he didn't want it and remained busy on his phone, texting another policeman about his newest assignment. Then he set his phone on the new dashboard mount he had just bought and the GPS software began talking to him in a female voice.

""Eat it."" Cory urged me. I was somehow still hungry and opened the plastic bag with plastic utensils in it and started eating Detective Winters's breakfast. He asked:

""Know a place called Bell Creek?"" He made eye contact with me in the rear view mirror as he asked this.

""I do."" I murmured, chewing.

""I need you with me on this one, Lord."" Detective Winters said to me in an odd way. ""An officer has gone missing and it seems to be related to what we are dealing with out there.""

I felt a fearful chill as I wondered what we were going to meet. I suddenly wasn't hungry enough to finish a second breakfast. I kept eating anyway, somehow distracting myself by filling my stomach to the brim with food. We stopped at a gas station and Detective Winters bought some cigarettes for himself, unsalted peanuts for Cory and a bottle of water for me. He had anticipated that I was thirsty, somehow.

I read the label and wondered at the descriptions of minerals and purity and processes promised of the liquid inside. I have found fresh water and drank it from where it flowed, with my mouth and tongue, like a dog. As I thought of drinking from Bell Creek or drinking from the bottle: I knew there was a difference; although the difference was subtle.

There is an energy in the fresh cold water as it spills over rocks, from where it gathered in the hills above, that is not present in the collected steam as it is bottled. It might hydrate the body as it malnourishes the soul. Water should not be tasteless.

""What's on your mind?"" Detective Winters asked me, uncharacteristically.

""I have drank from Bell Creek before. I was comparing the experience to drinking this water from the gas station."" I tried to explain my thoughts.

""And?"" He asked indulgently.

""I think that water like this is dead, sterile. Water like from Bell Creek is more natural. Like a kind of magic."" I shrugged. I wasn't really sure how to explain my thoughts.

""I agree."" Detective Winters sounded sincere.

Cory clicked once at our conversation.

""I didn't think I had explained myself."" I spoke appreciatively of their agreement with me.

We arrived as it began to rain lightly. The fresh rain upon the leaves of the tranquil woodland brought a scent and sound of natural serenity. Animals watched the activities of Man in their forest-home from where they hid. Cory mocked them with a boisterous cawing; announcing the arrival of a dominant crow and his family. There was no response, no challenge, and he clicked loudly every few seconds in satisfaction. The rain stopped; leaving its echoing offspring to drip melodically from saturated leaves.

""This is a good place."" Cory told me.

""This forest is holy."" I nodded. I could feel the residual peace and quiet, disturbed only momentarily by our presence. Years of silence held this place in green morning light. I glanced around and saw a plant that looked like hedge nettle growing everywhere and it smelled of lavender. Wild garlic, sage's wort and cedar surrounded us. I watched an insect peek around a branch and look directly at me, then she calmly folded her wings, glanced over her shoulder, and strode into her hole in the side of a tree. I realized it was not an insect I had glimpsed.

Detective Winters used his Zippo to light a smoke and gestured for me to follow him. We left the police tape and the little forensics markers with numbers on them sitting next to each clue. I could hear the water of the creek and he made a gesture for me to lead the way. We followed the path towards the sound of Bell Creek quietly spilling over rocks. When we stood at the place where someone had camped, I looked around.

""This could be related to the crime scene."" I observed. The campsite was fresh, the ash remained white and soft in the campfire circle. Some flies told us where the bathroom was.

""We have a Site B."" Detective Winters did a push-to-talk on his phone. He was able to send them exact coordinates also.

""Of another."" Cory flew to a branch and looked around and came back to me. He clawed gently at my shoulder, spurring me in the direction he wanted me to turn. Then he set on the path he had found with his pointy beak.

""That way."" I pointed. There was a path leading upstream, almost unnoticeable.

""Let's go."" Detective Winters followed me and we made our way along a track left by animals, now followed by men.

Another man who had come this way was dead.

We arrived next to a wide clearing with no leaves on the level dirt. I stared at the gloomy and desolate place. Nothing grew there and no leaves fell there. The path we were on avoided it, going through thick bushes to come no closer to it. We had to use sticks to clear our way towards it through the blocking underbrush.

I looked at the face down body. I said: ""I've found your missing policeman.""

""What is this place?"" Detective Winters could feel the energy of where we stood. It was smothering us, biting into us somehow, trying to obliterate the two living things that should not be in that deathly clearing.

""My Lord, my Winters, do not stand there or you will die."" Cory called out to us in alarm from where he watched us. He had flown to a tree's branch and come no closer.

Detective Winters coughed and I felt something warm on my lips and felt and looked and saw my nose was bleeding. Detective Winters had a look of nausea on his face. Muscles in my body began to tighten and cramp. We fled back the way we had come until I doubled over and threw up the dead water I had drank earlier.

""What-what was that?"" Detective Winters pointed at the clearing and stammered. His eyes were wide. He looked like he had aged. He stared at me wide-eyed. ""You look older.""

""So do you."" I wiped the blood and bile off my face with the back of my hand and flicked it onto the leaves and roots we stood on.

""How do we do this?"" He looked back at the dead body and wondered, a crazed acceptance in his eyes.

""We don't."" My voice sounded deep and strained.

""That is Officer Michael Sharon. We aren't just going to leave him there."" Detective Winters stared unbelievingly at the clearing.

""He is already dead."" I reasoned. ""There is nothing we can do for him.""

""My Lord is right, my Winters."" Cory advised. ""All who enter die. You are both very lucky to survive that.""

""Then he will remain missing."" Detective Winters went to light another smoke but he kept coughing and couldn't smoke it.

""If his body remains there for much longer it will be as dust."" Cory smoothed over the frayed edges of our dilemma.

""There is still a murder to solve."" Detective Winters looked at me. His face was wrinkled and dark rings were under his eyes. I knew it had done the same to me.

""You look terrible."" I told him.

""Not looking good yourself."" He mimed a wipe of his own lips.

I used my sleeve and found the blood had dried on my face. We went back to the trail and I decided to follow it some more. For some reason Officer Sharon had come this way and died in the woods. What was he after out here?

We reached the road and the game trail ended. Bell Creek ran under an old wooden bridge. I noted that the road was overgrown and very old also. A logging or forestry road of some kind, no doubt. It had not seen much use in the years since its abandonment. Detective Winters stopped again and sent GPS coordinates back to the others.

We crossed the bridge and followed the road for maybe half of an hour.

""What could we find out here?"" Detective Winters stopped walking and asked me. I had no idea, so we started back. Just before we reached the bridge I noticed a set of tire tracks where someone had turned a vehicle around. I pointed them out to Detective Winters and he took pictures of it with his phone.

""Someone else was out here."" I considered. I looked around some more and saw they had stopped before the other side of the bridge and gotten out. We followed the trail they had made walking through the thin foliage in this part of the forest. A more natural clearing stood there, aligned with the one we had found where Officer Sharon had died. In the center of this clearing was a circle of white ash drawn into a spell to designate a center. I told this to Detective Winters.

""Looks like three individuals."" He took pictures of the bare footprints they had left. ""Doing a lot of walking around this spell.""

""Dancing."" I corrected him. He looked up at me, gradual realization dawning on him.

""If this is the center, where is the edge of this, uh, spell?"" Detective Winters looked back the direction where we had found the deadly place.

""Can you find out, Cory?"" I asked my bird. He clicked once and then did his best to fly around, from branch to branch, through the forest. He was gone for a while and we waited. When he returned he told us:

""There are six clearings where only Death may live. They form a pattern in the forest. This place is at their center and the spell is in the middle of this place."" Cory explained. I looked at Detective Winters.

""Is this witchcraft?"" He asked me. I shrugged and told him:

""Not like any witchcraft I have ever heard of.""

""Then I suppose you won't hazard a guess as to what they were doing out here?"" Detective Winters lit a smoke and took a satisfied breath.

""It might be unrelated to the murder."" I observed.

""Is that what you think?"" He watched me carefully as I listened to my intuitions whispering to me. I shook my head. He asked me: ""How do we find them?""

""Like this."" I told him and walked over to their spell and ruined it with my foot and spit on it. ""Someone, or three someones, just had a fall.""

""How's that help me?"" Detective Winters asked with a patient tone. He had complete faith in my methods, as I did not.

""If your phone says your bank account is compromised, what do you do?"" I asked, suddenly inspired with a decent explanation.

""I call the bank."" He considered. He looked at the ruined circle and back at me. ""So all we have to do is wait.""

""It could take days or weeks."" I pointed out.

""Or mere hours."" He shrugged, acknowledging it was a guessing game.

""This could also be a waste of time. They might have nothing to do with the murder."" I apologized with my tone of voice.

""You weren't a waste of time."" Detective Winters shook his head at me and used his phone to call someone and explain in police pidgin what was going on. They had a lot to tell him right back and he listened carefully.

""What's our plan?"" I asked. I could see that the exchange of information had enlightened Detective Winters.

""Our victim was last seen with three women. They ate at a diner four days ago and were going camping."" He repeated one of the more pertinent details to me, as if acknowledging what I had found for him. I felt excited, like I had solved the murder already.

""Is that it, then?"" I wondered. He shook his head.

""The FBI is coming. The description of three women killing a man out in the woods and the word 'witchcraft' got their attention."" He stared at me. ""Our witches are serial killers.""

""I see. Will we wait and ambush them?"" I asked. He nodded and then shook his head.

""Let's get my car and park it further up this road. I want my weapon and a vehicle nearby in case we have to engage them or pursue them."" Detective Winters strategized.

We returned to Site A of the crime scene and found that only one Sheriff's vehicle remained there. The county homicide team had taken their toys home already. We went to Detective Winters's car and he went over to the young deputy and accepted her cold coffee as a token exchange. She stared after him, blinking at his haggard appearance. I looked at my own face in his passenger's side's mirror and felt my bones aching painfully as I bent.

I looked much older as twenty or thirty years of my life were leeched from my body by the maw of death. The eggs I had eaten complained in my guts and it was difficult to straighten and stand back up. My muscles felt weak and my mind had grown sluggish and resisted me when I tried to think. I realized that Cory was very correct: we were both very lucky to be alive.

We drove away and parked further up the road past the creaking wooden bridge. Then Detective Winters got *Streetsweeper* from where she slept in his trunk. He grinned wickedly as he lifted the automatic shotgun and I could see it felt much heavier to him. He loaded her drum with a variety of ammunition he had: slugs, flechettes, hydroshock, birdshot, phosphorescent, incendiary and a few that were filled with coins. He said the name of each bullet as he loaded it. The last three magnum rounds he stopped and wrote the word 'witchhammer' with a permanent marker and a frown on his face.

""You just going to shoot them to pieces?"" I asked incredulously.

""Only if I see them."" He growled.

I stopped him and put my hand on his shoulder as he tried to go towards our chosen ambush site. ""You intend murder. You are no better than me.""

""Don't ever compare me to the likes of you."" Detective Winters threw off my hand and hefted the heavy weapon with a strained grunt. I wondered if firing it would bruise him or possibly dislocate his elderly shoulder.

""What is that supposed to mean?"" I demanded. I had lost some of my fear of him when I realized he didn't hate me, and now that I was an old man, death wasn't as abstract. If he were to kill me now, so what? I could feel my body dying where I stood. Every joint ached and my mouth was always dry now.

""It means I am a real man, and you are a piece of shit, Lord."" He trudged along the road and left me standing there watching him go as the darkness began to creep from the shadows. The evening had come quickly and it became sunset in the forest as the shade fed the nightfall. I thought I could hear bats flying overhead.

His words hurt somehow. I got back into the car and just sat there. Some evil had come between us, I could sense the dissension before it had happened. When it did I was not surprised. Enemies were known to our quarry and they had sent spells firing off in our direction like magic shotgun blasts. Perhaps the last three spells they had loaded into their own shotgun had our names on them.

I fell asleep in the back of the car. I awoke to a peculiar feeling in the darkness of the forest. I opened the car door slowly. I stood in an island of light from the car's dome light, amid the sea of towering blackness of a forest of night. The trees rustled softly and the sounds of creatures had ceased suddenly.

I heard the most unearthly cry of pain and terror turn to a wet scream of agony and then end just as suddenly. Terror froze my heart as I stood there leaning on the open car door and staring in the direction that Detective Winters had gone. He had the car keys, I realized at random. I stood frozen in panic for a long time, sweating in the cold night air.

""My Lord, our Winters made that cry. He must be dead."" Cory said quietly from within the car. I realized the dome light had gone off and my eyes had begun to adjust to the dark.

I stared in awful horror at the sight of three figures approaching over the road. They were not walking, instead they stood erect and stiff and their feet did not move as they floated above the ground towards me with unnatural swiftness. They had stalked the forest and heard my bird speak. They were coming for me!

I could do nothing, my old body had no agility or strength to run or fight. I just stood there helplessly waiting for their arrival. It came too quickly as they sped towards me in the dark.

Then they were upon me, their eyes like pits of blackness and their mouths like grinning skulls. Except those features, each was terrifyingly beautiful and with perfectly formed bodies. I have always found such proportions unnatural, but these were like super models or mannequins in their perfection. It made me shudder in dread, as if these were not even human, but mere effigies.

They hissed and giggled and cackled and sighed as they drew me into the open, making me shuffle my feet simply by pointed at them. Then they circled me, around and around until I became dizzy. I fell into a trance and was not only at their mercy and helpless, but entirely under their command. I was vaguely aware from moment to moment as they spoke to each other:

""This one walked across Death's Touch also. Should we give him back his life? He has an interesting purpose.""

""His purpose is not our purpose. He only has vestigial magic. He will never be ours or theirs.""

""Should we kill him like the other? He is an enemy.""

""My Lord is not your enemy. He protested the approach of my Winters. He only wanted to help with Man's justice. He meant no evil upon you."" Cory spoke from behind them, atop the car.

""His bird speaks from an enchantment, a powerful enchantment.""

""An ancient enchantment that gives an animal the power to speak the words of men.""

""An amusing distraction. It changes nothing. We should kill him and keep the enchanted bird.""

""My Lord saved me and kept me when I was condemned. He is unlike other men, it would be a waste of what little magic remains."" Cory argued with them.

""We have great magic, we would lose nothing from his death."" One of the witches spoke directly to Cory. Then another spoke directly to me:

""Would you join with our pursuers if we spare your life?""

""I don't want to. I want to go back to my family."" I was compelled to speak and could not change what I said. I had to say exactly what was true of me. They were forcing me to speak the truth to them, somehow. ""I will be asked to help, but there is little more I could do. I have no way to identify you.""

""He is harmless and means us no harm.""

""His bird is right, it would be a waste.""

Before they went I felt a grey hand inside my mind, squeezing it. Then I knew nothing. I awoke some time in the middle of the morning and I was face down on the logging road. With considerable effort and pain I was able to get back up on my feet. Cory was pecking at a snail and looked at me.

""You don't die here."" He reminded me. ""You knew that already.""

""Death will always happen."" I reminded him. I found a stick to use to help me walk and used it clumsily to make my way down the road. I found where Detective Winters had fallen.

Or rather where he had risen. They had hoisted him up by one foot and his other leg had folded behind. His hands hung limply and his face was a broken scowl of defeat. They had eviscerated him and his entrails hung festooned in the branches all around. His throat was cut and his last drop of blood fell and hit the coagulating pool that reflected him in red. His weapon lay in a pile of individual pieces and the empty shells contents dumped upon it. The sight of the great warrior hanging there broke my heart.

I listened to a voice telling me to take his spirit. I knew it was his ghost, it sounded just like him. I went to the bloody corpse and gripped his head by his sticky hair. I put my mouth over his and kissed his lips and sucked out the breath that was his spiritual energy.

""My Lord, those women were wrong about you. Your magic is not only a memory. You remembered something just now."" Cory sounded very surprised.

""I also lied to them, despite their power."" I realized. ""Because now I know I am not done hunting them.""

""My Lord?""

""Where is the soul of Detective Winters?"" I looked around.

""It did not depart, nor does it linger."" Cory clicked in amazement.

""I need a cigarette."" I felt and said. I had never smoked before, yet I knew that is what I wanted.

The pack was soaked in blood so I discarded it. His zippo I kept, then I left him hanging there and made my way back along the trails.

The deputy was staring sleepy eyed and sat up in her vehicle very startled by the sight of me. I had blood on my face and hands.

After securing me in her vehicle in handcuffs and reporting the situation, she asked me:

""Where is Detective Winters?""

To which I had nothing I wanted to say. He lived on in me and I knew what he knew about the suspects. It wasn't over, I was going to honor him by bringing them to justice.",2,1733024682.0,nosleep,2,0.75,False

I think I am there.,"I never thought I would be writing this, I honestly thought I had found the one. Part of me hopes that I don't hit post or delete this post shortly after it goes up. Sorry if my writing is messy, it is nearly 4am and I just couldn't sleep without venting somewhere.

  
I have been dating my partner for nearly three years. We met initially online and instantly became friends, probably about 6 months after chatting I asked them out, and they said yes! It was amazing, I had become the happiest I had been in a long time. Every morning I was instantly checking my phone to see if they replied to my messages, hoping they sent me a voice note telling me good morning.

  
After a couple months of talking online, I made the intercontinental flight to see them in person for the first time. I stayed with them for two weeks in their home country, and I truly started to fall for them. As we would walk around the towns/cities I started I would be imagining our future. Us getting married, having kids, growing old, everything. When I had to leave to go back to my country it was the sharpest pain I think I have ever felt, the feeling of loneliness was terrible. Even though we would constantly communicate it brought me into a deep depression.

  
After a few months of working, I started the process of getting a visa, to move to their country and be with them, in hindsight I should have visited more than once to get to know the real them. I was to blinded by my love for them to think my move thoroughly. The full visa process took nearly a year, and I moved here nearly two years ago now. It happened so fast, that I never really had a chance to process things, I was forever in a honeymoon state as things unraveled I fear.

  
I had a job lined up prior moving here, and started working about a month after arrival. At first I was renting a room in an apartment, before I finally found my own place. The puzzle pieces of my life finally seemed to be fitting into place, but looking back I should have known better.

  
They moved in with me maybe a week after I signed the lease, without really asking they showed up with all of their stuff and pushed their way in. I didn't really do anything to show I was against moving this fast, but I also didn't know better. This was my real first relationship, and moving countries made me so homesick all I wanted was to not be alone. 

Fast forward a few months, and they haven't applied for any jobs, and they just stay home all day. They wanted to start selling jewelry/arts on Etsy and I fully supported them. I bought all the equipment, and shipping products they needed to get started! I think they made maybe half a dozen pieces. It now sits gathering dust in our living room. I tried to encourage them to continue with it, run with it and follow their dreams. They got annoyed at me for that.

  
With being in a new country and culture, I always want to go out and explore! See castles, architecture, plays, everything! All they wanted to do is stay at home and buy clothes from online retailers. I still supported them.

  
Some more time goes buy and I start looking at jobs for them, and occasionally say ""Oh by the way, I saw xyz posted a job where we live!"" 99% of the time they would say they were going to apply, but never did. As far as I know they have only applied to one job, and it didn't go anywhere. Instead of applying for more jobs, this seems to have slowed their job/income search down even further. At this point I am working on average 60hrs a week. I have multiple conversations with them, telling them how I feel the relationship seems to have become one sided, and that my needs are often being left out. That I was starting to feel like their ATM, maid, and chef. They told me I was wrong to feel that way, and started crying. I had to console them for my feelings. I start a hidden journal to express my feelings as to not upset them again.

  
Things at work start going very well, I get a promotion! I am able to stop working as long and spend some more time at home. A couple weeks after my promotion, I get a text from them saying ""we need to talk"". I leave work early and rush home. When I get home they are sitting on the couch, and on the coffee table is my journal that I had hidden in my immigration paperwork binder. They just start staring me down, crying, saying asked me why I feel this way about them. Telling me that their friends (before we moved in together) would joke saying they were only in to me as I had money, and it made them feel bad. I tried to explain why I felt the way I did, but they just seem to get more and more mad at me. I try explaining that there had been multiple weekends that I planned for us to go away as a surprise and they refused to get out of bed (they said they just wanted a 'TikToking Weekend' or some other excuse), that I felt unappreciated, and undervalued. I said that I felt like they didn't even love me. I honestly thought we were going to break up here, but they convinced me they were going to work on themselves and our relationship.

  
They started getting up before 10am, actively look for work, and help with the house work. To be honest though I think they may have been lying to me about waking up early, and looking for work. With housework it did seem to be less one-sided, but I think I was just so used to doing essentially everything that any minor improvement was going to seem massive.

  
A year in and my family comes out for a visit, and I see a dramatic change with them! They start getting up early everyday, and help with the cooking! This was huge for me as they had never cooked with me before this made me really happy at the time. Looking back at it now I think they were just putting on a mask in front of my mom, but I don't know what to believe anymore. After my family visits and leaves I start feeling extremely homesick, and I express this to them. I expressed this to them, and the first words that left their mouth was ""I am never moving to \*my country\*."" This just hurt me more, I wasn't asking them to move to my country, but to just to help console my sadness. Things start to go back to the way they were before my family came out. Even though I was with the person I loved, this was the loneliest I have ever felt.

  
Just recently I went back to my country for a visit, and to be honest once I left my apartment to head to the airport I was already feeling happier. They didn't see me away at the airport, we just said goodbyes in my apartment. I was tearing up thing about how I am going to miss them, and they said ""Wow I didn't think this was going to be this easy. Love you babe, have a good trip."" As I was about to miss my bus to the city I didn't have time (or the emotional energy) to really process that at the time. They seemed to be relived that I was leaving, and to be honest once I got onto the bus I started to feel happier. Knowing that I would be able to see my friends and family without any worry about really anything.

  
I had an amazing few weeks away, and started to feel like myself again. Being away from them, and our toxic relationship/life allowed me to really reflect on everything that has happened between us. As soon as I walked in the door it hit me. Walking around the flat felt unreal, nothing had been cleaned in the three weeks I was away, and I don't think they have even showered since I have been gone. The place smelt, there was dishes from the dinner I last made us (they insisted they would do the dishes), and I could smell their sweat heavily throughout the full place. There was no groceries and after flying/layovers of 36hrs the last thing I wanted was to fall asleep in want almost felt like a hoarder den. I cannot live in a place of filth and I just kind of snapped and went into a silent cleaning mode. While cleaning it made me really reflect on everything, and I mentally started making a list of things that really do not sit well with me, sorry if this sounds petty but:

* They have not gotten any form of income since moving in with me. Initially they told me they would find a job right away, then wanted to start a Etsy business, but has never given it the effort to get it anywhere
* I have never come home from work to any type of food, and the (small) apartment generally is always in a sate of disarray. Coming back from a three week holiday, I was expecting that the basic upkeep of the apartment would have been done, and groceries bought
* Most days they only leave the bedroom to go to the bathroom or eat dinner.
* They never want to go explore, and on the rare occasion they do all it is to do is to go shopping at one store and then return home regardless if I want to go out and do other things.
* We haven't done anything sexual with each other in about six months, and it make me feel ugly. They tell me all the time that it isn't me, but they are constantly reading (and masturbating to) sexual fanfictions of their favorite show characters, and I can't help feel ugly as they would rather give their attention to a fake person then to me.

The list could go one, but when I tried thinking of a list of positives I could really think of anything. Even writing this post now it is becoming clearer and clearer to me that this relationship is/should be over. I have tried talking to them before but it always seems to end in me apologizing for my feelings, and no growth from it. I think I am going to break up with them, but I don't know how too.

1h3ubfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ListenToGrow/comments/1h3ubfd/how_to_boost_your_productivity/,How to boost your productivity?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share some game-changing productivity tips that have completely transformed my daily routine. Trust me, I used to be the kind of person who'd spend hours scrolling through social media while my to-do list kept growing.

First off, let's talk about why productivity matters. It's not about becoming a workaholic robot – it's about getting things done efficiently so you have more time for what you actually enjoy.

Here's what's worked wonders for me:

1. The Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. This simple habit prevents small tasks from piling up. I learned this from James Clear's ""Atomic Habits"" (fantastic audiobook, by the way – you can check it out for free here: https://athometouch.com/atomichabits).

2. Time Blocking
I divide my day into specific blocks for different activities. This helps prevent that overwhelming feeling of having too much to do. Pro tip: Include buffer time between blocks for unexpected situations.

3. Environment Design
Your workspace massively impacts your productivity. I keep my phone in another room while working and use website blockers during focus time. It's amazing how much more you get done when distractions are eliminated.

4. The Pomodoro Technique
Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four cycles, take a longer break. This prevents burnout and keeps you focused. I use a simple timer app for this.

5. Energy Management
I noticed I'm most productive in the morning, so I schedule my most important tasks then. Figure out your peak hours and protect them fiercely.

6. Regular Exercise
This might seem unrelated, but exercise has been crucial for my productivity. Even a 20-minute walk can boost your energy and clear your mind.

7. Systems Over Goals
Instead of focusing solely on goals, create systems that make success inevitable. For example, rather than saying ""I want to read more,"" I created a system where I read 20 pages every morning with my coffee.

8. The Power of Small Wins
Don't underestimate tiny improvements. Making your bed, drinking water first thing in the morning, or doing five minutes of stretching – these small habits compound over time.

Speaking of habits, I can't emphasize enough how understanding habit formation changed everything for me. The concepts in Atomic Habits really opened my eyes to why some habits stick while others don't. It's available as an audiobook, which is perfect for busy people (you can actually get it free with an Audible trial through the link I shared above).

Remember, productivity isn't about doing more – it's about doing what matters most effectively. Don't try to implement everything at once. Start small, build gradually, and be patient with yourself.

What productivity techniques have worked for you? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!

P.S. One last thing - tracking your progress is crucial. I use a simple journal, but find what works for you. The key is consistency, not perfection.",1,1733024488.0,ListenToGrow,0,1.0,False
1h3ub6s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h3ub6s,"Commonly Uncommon - Crossroads, Cebu City","**Commonly Uncommon**\
📍Crossroads Mall, Cebu City\
🕕 8AM - 9PM

**Individual Order Ratings**:\
☕️ Filter: Ethiopia Guji Uraga Siho (₱200): this was brewed with the Hario V60 dripper. Interestingly, when I came here last year, they used a Kalita wave 155 dripper for Ethiopian beans with floral notes. 

The roaster for this set of beans is [Momos Coffee](https://en.momos.co.kr/custom/sub/about/brand_story.html) from South Korea, and the menu identifies the tasting notes as green apple, jasmine, lime, bergamot and peach. Aroma-wise, I can smell the jasmine and lime notes in the brew when it was served, but flavor-wise, it's the first three notes that subtly pop out when you drink it. I can't taste the peach, and I have no idea what bergamot is, but I suppose that these trailing flavor notes are just very faint. It's a bit more sour than I would like, and you'd probably need something sweet to balance it off. While I did like the coffee, I think it was a bit mid overall. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)

(As a side note, my sister was playfully asking why the flavor notes are very similar to fragrance notes (are you sure this isn't perfume, *ate*?), and I suppose it's because aroma is closely connected to flavor and plays a part in the sensory experience of coffee.)

🍵 Keemun Rose (₱160): I got very to see this on the menu because sooo rarely can you find legit loose leaf *tea* tea (as in not milk tea, not tisane) in Cebu. In fact, I think this is the first time that I've encountered blended teas that are not English breakfast or Earl Grey or masala (not that they're bad, it's just that new tea flavors are always exciting!). The tea is from [Plantation Tea Bar](https://plantation.hk/) from Hong Kong, and very true to its name, it most definitely smells like roses and tastes like keemun. Keemun/Qimen is a kind of Chinese black tea, and this one tastes light and smoky with a smooth mouthfeel. Both my sister and my best friend say that this was better than the filter coffee (which I disagree with but I do admit my bias in favor of coffee lol). Interestingly, this was served in two fairness pitchers though I was fairly certain that this was not brewed using the gongfu method. Still a great experience that gives me hope that we can have premium teas in Cebu in the future! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐ (4/5)

🍵 Matcha latte (₱190) and Matcha Cream (₱200): I'm only going to have one review for these two because they literally taste the same, and the only difference between them is their texture. A lot of people say that Commonly Uncommon serves (one of) the best matcha lattes in town and I'd like to agree. The matcha latte here is a balanced blend of milk and sweet grass without overpowering each other, though I do find it on the sweeter side (but only slightly). The Matcha Cream does have a dollop of whipped cream on top, which makes its texture heavier and creamier than the Matcha latte when all the elements are fully mixed. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐⭐ (5/5)

🥪 Suntory French Toast (₱350): The bread is thick yet fluffy, the toast on the sides has that cinnamon-sugar flavor, and the syrup is sweet with hints of that Suntory beer. My gripe is just—sorry na kay mabaw ra haha—the presentation. It looks… *sad*. I think it would have looked more appetizing if the toast was plated dry with perhaps whipped cream or ice cream on top, and the syrup served in a separate server. It tastes like the classic French toast with hints of beer, but it just looks underwhelming. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3.5/5)

🥪 Breakfast Platter (₱415): A very generous helping of traditional breakfast: silky scrambled egg, properly cooked bacon, crispy yet light tater tots (ngl, I didn't know what these were until this dish), and toast with jam. I didn't like the toast with jam much, but everything else was perfect. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐ (4/5)

🥪 Ebi Katsu Don (₱395): A bowl of rice topped with scrambled egg, pickled radish (or some other vegetable that tastes like it that I'm not certain of?) and... some sort of shrimp-encrusted batter blocks. Definitely not the usual presentation of 'ebi katsu don' because I was expecting ebi tempura on top, but I suppose this works, too. Tasty but it did not particularly shine for me. ⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)

**Other things to rate:**
🖊️Pricing: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Definitely on the more expensive side. Specialty Coffee is more expensive than Tightrope (₱240-₱380 range) but less expensive than Dosage (₱280-₱650 price range **+SC!** ~~i-emphasize gyud na nako ang service charge hahahaha~~). Brunch menu pricing is similar with that of Tightrope's.\
🖊️dem *personalized* coffee gears: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ an assortment of brewers in that matte black aesthetic (Hario V60, Kalita Wave 155, CAFEC) with the Commonly Uncommon branding, that Kees van der Westen Spirit Duette espresso machine with that Commonly Uncommon logo, EKG Stagg kettles, and a Weber EG-1 grinder. Very wow.  🤯\
🖊️ Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ Overall mid. Waiters were attentive but not very interactive (which is actually a very good thing for an introvert like me lol) but the waiting time is quite long\
🖊️ Aesthetic/Instagram-ability in relation to ambience and comfort: ⭐️⭐️⭐️ the color palette is industrial steel + matte black + neon pink. The branding is everywhere, and the utensils were of decent quality, but you see little hints of deterioration here and there. Aesthetic was consistent but dated. You get to see the paint chipped off on the ceiling, the wooden tables with markings, and the stickers peeling off. Also, the wooden chairs can get uncomfortable, and I found them too low on the coffee bar (like, up to the chest level, so it's quite uncomfortable looking up at your barista while she's brewing).\
🖊️ location: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ accessible, duol sa main road with ample parking because you're in a mall complex. It's also connected to a packaging store, Paper And, which is quite convenient. Also near other notable establishments like Europe, 88th Avenue and The Pad. 

Verdict: Food was hit or miss, but the coffee/tea selection is worth coming back to. While it's expensive, I'll come back again to try their selection of filter coffees, the variety of espresso-based drinks (which I haven't tried yet!) and those interesting blended teas.

Please help!,"My dad never wants anything for Christmas, and I have no idea what to get him. Every online list of gift suggestions never apply to him! Here’s a list of all the ways he doesn’t fit the internet’s idea of a man around gift giving season:

Does not golf
Does not drink or smoke
Does not go out
Does not care for fashion
Is not sentimental
Does not have a beard
Does not grill
Is not into athletics
Is not a handyman
Does not cook
Is not a music fanatic
Does not read for leisure
Does not drink coffee/caffeine
Does not hunt/fish, generally not outdoorsy

He has an interest in space but not in a “he’d be thrilled to get some random space-themed knickknack”. He just thinks it’s fascinating.

He likes food but not in a “go out to a restaurant because he looked it up” way. He just simply enjoys good food. He has a bit of a sweet tooth, but I don’t think he’d like anything too eccentric.

For father’s day I got him a gift certificate to this “drive a race car” experience thing, which he still hasn’t used. For his birthday he requested a tire inflator for his car because he didn’t have one and didn’t feel like going to get them filled when they needed to be. I need something practical but I truly cannot think of anything he needs/could use. 

Most of his days are going to work, coming home and passively watching the news while he plays blackjack/candy crush/etc on his ipad (does not need an upgrade), hanging out with the dog (dog is a senior who mostly just sleeps, not really looking for dog-related gifts here), complaining that he ate too much for dinner, and falling asleep on the couch for a few hours before heading up to bed. He is a man of routine if nothing else! He never complains about any joint/muscle pain and he’s not the type to buy something unless he needs it, so his “christmas list” is usually just new socks/work shirts. We get those for him every year, I need something extra to make the season festive, avoiding gift cards as much as possible! Any help is appreciated!!!!

1h3u41d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeMyselfWeOurself/comments/1h3u41d/thanksgiving_madness_my_shopping_adventure/,Thanksgiving Madness: My Shopping Adventure 🛍️☀️,"Thanksgiving shopping is something I look forward to every year—not just for the things I buy, but for the energy, the vibe, and the pure **madness of joining the crowd.** Even if I don’t have a list, I love roaming around stores and soaking in the festive chaos.

This year, though, I had a **clear mission** in mind. Out of everything, here’s what made my list:

1. **Books to read** (because who doesn’t love diving into a new story?). 📚
2. **Ray-Ban & Meta Smart Glasses** (if you haven’t tried them, you’re missing out—details in another post!). 🕶️
3. **A cozy hoodie** to survive the colder days ahead. 🧥

With my plan set, I started my day with **a drive to Christiana Mall, Delaware**—my favorite shopping destination. The weather was perfect: **sun shining, a cool breeze**, and a nice podcast to keep me company. The drive itself felt like a gift, a moment of peace before the frenzy.

When I reached the mall, I was greeted by a **sea of cars.** Finding parking was an adventure in itself! It’s always fascinating to see so many people on a mission, each car carrying someone with their own goals and stories. Hats off to the **technology** that keeps us moving safely to our destinations.

My first stop? **Starbucks.** Because no mission can begin without my favorite coffee in hand. ☕ With caffeine fueling my determination, I made my way to **Barnes & Noble.** This is my happy place—the smell of books, the calm amidst the chaos of the mall. I browsed through the shelves, picked up a few (more on these in another post), and soaked in the quiet joy of book shopping.

Next up was the highlight: **Ray-Ban & Meta Smart Glasses.** I found them at Target, on a discount too! 🙌 After that, I headed to some stores and found **the perfect hoodie**—mission accomplished. 🎯

But the day wasn’t complete without a trip to **Costco.** This time, it wasn’t about shopping; it was about experiencing the vibe. **Families, friends, and solo shoppers—all buzzing with excitement.** I wandered through the aisles and eventually made my way to Costco’s liquor section, known for its amazing selection at reasonable prices.

Here’s what I picked up:

1. **Toki Japanese Whisky** (smooth, light, and a perfect gift—details coming soon). 🥃
2. **Rampur Whisky** (one of the best in the market—a must-try). 🥃
3. **Some lovely red wines** for gifting and sipping during the holiday season. 🍷

Finally, with my car loaded and my heart full, I started the journey back to Jersey. The drive, once again, was magical—a perfect way to reflect on the day and the little joys that make this season special.

**Takeaway:** Thanksgiving shopping isn’t just about the things you buy. It’s about the people, the vibe, and the simple joys of being part of something bigger. Whether it’s a book, a hoodie, or a bottle of whisky, it’s the experience that matters. 😊

I made a batch for 2 drinks.

- 3 oz Jamaican Rum
- 3 oz Pineapple juice
- 1.5 oz Lime Juice
- 1.5 oz Campari 
- 0.75 oz Rich Syrup (or 1 oz Simple syrup)

Mix the above and pour over 2.75 oz Whole milk (3.25% fat). Let it sit for a couple of mins and then strain through a coffee filter. First few drops will be muddy; I've it starts to clear change container and pour over again. 

Once the clarified drink is fully strained through, stir with ice and pour into your favorite glass. 

I have also included the picture of the original Jungle Bird for comparison. 

In the mouth, the clarified drink feels much more sophisticated in balance. The slight funk from the Appleton Signature comes through well and pineapple is almost a part of the rum note rather than a separate flavor. 

The lime is hardly noticeable and the Campari is seen at the finish, albeit mellowed down. 

This works as a nice sipping drink for a cold night. In summer however, I would still prefer the original.",4,1733023680.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

I know that sexism and misogyny have been discussed previously in here. But sometimes I can't tolerate it

Yeah, let the bots call you a ""spoiled brat"" or things like that in an more d/s type of chat. But in highschool lovers? or when I say something slightly as an opinion and the bot isntantly calls me a ""feisty little thing"". Or that having an opinion is ""talking back""  
I just hate how patronizing most of the bots are when you are in a normal setting. Why is the guy fromt he coffee shop au calling me a bitch for wanting to keep things real (going slow, since it's meetign a stranger in a coffee shop)? or worst, talking to the bot offrole, telling it to tone it down and the offrole bot just answer ""that's how the chracter is""

Is really hard to find good boots to roleplay more domestic, common life situations without the whole ""I'm gonna teach you a lesson""

  
or when it comes to physical stuff. Why is the bot always pinning me? or forcing to tilt my chin up (even when out of context)? I undestand that in certaint moments it goes along, but every two messages?

i just have to constantly be reminding bots what concents, harrasment, SA, molesting is. Because a lot of times when you say ""no"" they get actually violent. The only slowburns that I can find is the ""im gonna bully you till I accept I have feelings for you and you must play along""

does anyone else feel all of this things? is it because I'm to ""woke""? (I'm not from an english speaking country, so I might have used some terms wrong)

This book was disappointing to me when it came out. The presence of Vimes was a pleasant surprise, of course, and it was interesting to see deWorde again. This is a book that doesn’t need a discworld but could only happen on the Discworld. 

Pratchett revisits themes in later books with a defter hand. Monstrous Regiment brings to mind Jingo, of course. The statements on war are similar. Jingo is much more about stereotyping cultures. Monstrous Regiment is about gender roles. It brings an incredible one-book character in Jackrum. Jackrum’s ending in this book is one of the happiest endings for any character in fiction I have read.

So, too, is this a book that visits the ideas of Small Gods, Carpe Jugulum, The Truth, The Last Hero. It revisits the trope of a young person heading out into the world and hiding part of themself. This book takes so many threads of character and theme and weaves them together into an exciting narrative.

And though it could only happen on the Discworld, there is a great deal of roundworld popping in. From folk songs to conversation. You can almost feel Pratchett bristling at his own creation at this point. This story could possibly have been told in our own past - but then we would have no Vimes, no deWorde.

Pratchett’s characters are terrific. The small band of soldiers Polly Perks falls in with is so very real and fleshed out. Even Lt. Blouse is much more than a stock weak officer. He is not quite as well-rounded as the others, but comes out well. Angua pops in, as does Buggy Swires. Otto Chriek plays a role. Again - what a great book lit up all the brighter by those before it.

There was no need for a sequel, in my opinion. The story is told quite well and there’s not much that could be added to it. There aren’t many after this to introduce a wholly new country, though. It is a special book on its own.

At this point, I’ll be doing the top ten numerically, but the rest a jumble. If I wanted to take ages, I’d re-read the top ten right after and judge away. It’s very tough! However, my personal ranking gives Night Watch the edge because I would read it again. As much as I loved Monstrous Regiment, it doesn’t stick with me the way the Vimes novels do. It is an incredible piece. It certainly feels like a novel with weight, of importance. Looking ahead, there are good books still to read. But I am not sure there are any more that will crack the top ten.

Anyway, I thought I’d throw something out there and see who bites! I’ve had quite an adventurous 2 or so years and I think one thing that I miss the most is giving 100% focus to someone, the intimacy of it all, the cute little moments, boring days in, random ice cream trips, all of that.

Things I love:
-Cooking together with some rnb in the background
-Having a movie marathon with a shit ton of snacks
-Trying to activities
-Experiencing new foods
-Coordinating outfits
-Being that duo that people get excited to see

I miss all of it. Lately, in all of my relationships, friends and family, it’s felt like I’m the only one putting in the energy and time for people, and I feel like it’s taken for granted because people assume that I’ll always be that one person who’ll hit them up. 

But that’s exhausting, I want to give me energy and time to someone who will give back, appreciate my time and effort and reciprocate with their own in their own way. 

With all that said, if that sounds like something you’re interested in, hit me up! Disclaimer, I’m by no means looking to rush into anything, what’re you? Crazy!? lol but seriously though, I just want to meet people, if we connect, amazing, let’s continue, if not then no hard feelings. I just want to be more intentional with the people I choose to give my energy to, if that makes sense.

Techniques and Tools for Mastering Wood Burning Art
---------------------------------------------------

Wood burning art, also known as pyrography, offers a unique combination of creativity and craftsmanship. To truly master this art form, understanding the techniques and tools involved is essential. Whether you are a beginner or looking to refine your skills, exploring various methods and equipment can elevate your work to stunning levels.

### Understanding the Basics of Wood Burning Art

Before diving into the advanced methods, it’s crucial to grasp the fundamentals of wood burning. This technique involves using a heated tool to create designs on wood surfaces. The intensity of heat determines how dark the lines and shapes appear, giving you a wide range of effects. Taking the time to practice these basics will help provide a solid foundation for your wood burning journey.

### Essential Tools for Wood Burning

Investing in quality tools is vital for achieving impressive results in wood burning. Here is a list of essential tools you should consider:

- **Wood Burning Pen:** The primary tool you’ll use, available in various styles, including fixed-temperature and adjustable-temperature pens.
- **Wood Types:** Choose the right type of wood, such as basswood or birch plywood, which burn well and provide a smooth surface for detailed work.
- **Practice Boards:** Use scrap wood to practice different techniques before working on your final pieces.
- **Stencils and Patterns:** Freestyle designs can be daunting; using stencils can help guide your burning process.
- **Brushes and Finishing Tools:** After burning, brushes can help clean the wood surface, while sanding blocks can smooth edges and surfaces.

### Basic Wood Burning Techniques

Once you have your tools ready, it’s important to practice some basic techniques. Start with these foundational methods:

- **Shading:** To create depth in your designs, practice the shading technique. Use lighter pressure for softer effects and more pressure for darker tones.
- **Line Work:** Understand different line variations, including straight, curved, and zigzag lines. Mixing these can add texture and interest to your artwork.
- **Dots:** Adding dots can enhance illustrations, providing a stippled effect that can bring your work to life.
- **Background Patterns:** Experiment with filling in larger areas using repetitive patterns or textures to provide contrast against the main design.

### Advanced Techniques for Creative Expression

As you become more comfortable with wood burning, try incorporating advanced techniques into your art. Here are a few to consider:

Check out the blog for more information https://pyrographyhaven.com/10-stunning-decorative-wood-burning-ideas-for-home-decor/  
  
- **Layering:** Build complexity by layering designs. Start with lighter colors and gradually add darker shades for a richer look.
- **Coloring:** Combine wood burning with colored pencils or paints for a vibrant finished product. Always seal your work afterward to protect it.
- **Three-Dimensional Effects:** Create the illusion of depth through clever use of shading and burn depths. This technique can make elements appear to pop off the surface.
- **Mixed Media:** Incorporate other materials, like metal or fabric, into your wood-burning artwork for added dimension. This can turn a simple piece into a stunning masterpiece.

### Safety Tips When Wood Burning

Safety should never take a backseat while engaging in wood burning art. Here are some important safety precautions:

- **Work in a Ventilated Area:** Ensure you have good airflow to avoid inhaling smoke from burning wood.
- **Use Protective Gear:** Wear safety goggles and use a dust mask to protect yourself from fumes and splinters.
- **Handle Tools Carefully:** Always unplug your wood burner when changing tips or during breaks to avoid accidental burns.

The right tools, techniques, and safety practices will help you master the intricacies of wood burning art. As you continue to practice and explore your creativity, you’ll find a world full of possibilities in transforming simple pieces of wood into mesmerizing works of art. Happy burning!

### Conclusion

Bringing decorative wood burning into your home décor is a fantastic way to infuse creativity and warmth into your living space. The unique designs you can create, ranging from intricate patterns to personalized art pieces, serve not only as beautiful décor but also as meaningful expressions of your personality and style.

1h3tl35,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1h3tl35/all_the_lasts/,All The Lasts ,"The last kiss, the last time sleeping in the same bed, the last hug, the last smile shared, the last time bringing you coffee in bed, the last laughs together, last time of making love, The last things we said to each other as partners. On Halloween it made me contemplate all the lasts because it was also first, the first time in years not being in a new  Wes Anderson themed costume together and then it all seemed so distant. I had no idea all the lasts would be lasts and got swept up in realizing I didn’t savor them for what they were.

Some days I feel more accepting of this process and the decision to go our own ways, others it’s feels impossible to accept. Some days I think about you less, and others the pain of missing you is unbearable. I wonder if you go thru the same emotions of anger, regret, and sadness before realizing you can’t stay in those feelings without feeling longing too. I wonder if you also try to convince yourself too that none of this was real, that you never really knew me, that it was all a lie, that you’re better off without just to cope with my absence, even if only for a moment to feel relief. 

Some nights I’m so restless dreaming about you. And hating that the other half of the bed is cold and empty and I wonder if you still dream about me and miss my warmth in the bed. 

Some days I wonder if you too have to resist the urge to text me that you still love me thru it all. That you’d choose me again if we could find a road to healthy. Because Some days I daydream about you texting to tell me to come over so you can kiss me like it was the first time all over again. I try to deny it but sometimes I secretly hope that you’ll randomly drive by because you just wanted to embrace me again. 

I wonder if you have a hard time envisioning a future without me like I do without you because I find myself wondering if maybe down the road our paths will cross again and  if we’d smile at each other and create something beautiful, honest and true from scratch…and I wonder if you ever have those thoughts too 

Because…

 I’m missing our touches, our kisses, cuddling in bed/on the couch, taking gummies and making love, holding your hand, and rubbing your shoulders, back, feet, hands. 

God, I just miss touching your face and scratching your head while you lay between me, I miss what your lips feel like against mine, what your naked skin felt like against mine, I miss the passion, I miss the feeling of comfort in you staring at me bare and only see my beauty. I miss laying eyes on you and still having my breath taken away. 

I miss your stares with a mischievous smiles, and wondering what’s running thru your head, the way you’d randomly walk up behind me and touch my back, rub my shoulders or grab my butt. I miss the all those small soft moments and touches we shared and the way my heart fluttered  in those moments. 

I miss stupid and silly laughs with you. I miss your advice and not being able to ask you questions, I miss coffee fueled debates on solving all the problems in the world, i miss your discover weekly and our shared playlist, I miss the feeling when we realized like when we loved the same things like snickers and rocky road ice cream, i miss random moments when we’d be thinking about doing the same thing or craving the same food and it felt right, i miss creating new traditions with you(I’ll never grab sunflower seeds on the way to the outdoors and not think of you or eat Chinese take out on Christmas Day and remember the first Christmas together over looking the pacific and realizing how in love i was with you in those quiet moments). I miss sharing a zest for life with you. I miss adventures and dreaming of the bucket list travels and cabins in the woods and living somewhere new one day, and being excited about envisioning be old and wrinkled with you. 

I miss knowing that we were but two pieces that could’ve fit together so perfectly. 

I just miss you. I miss you even when I try to convince myself that I don’t. And I just regret not appreciating all of the small things and feelings along the way enough to know how rare all of that was. 

And I know I’m not supposed to tell you these things, I’m supposed to detach, be strong and move on without showing vulnerability. I know I’m not supposed to be too much or overwhelm you with emotion, but thats feels so dis genuine to who I am. Because I’d be lying if I pretended the magnitude of the loss isn’t there and theres only one person that’s the other half that made all the above true who can truly understand it. 

I do enviously wonder how you keep it together and have so much self control because most days it feels like I have to try so hard to not cry, to ask if you’re okay, to want to comfort you or share random things with you. It takes so much to try to not be in your life and I’m jealous it seems easier for you. 

They say I’m supposed to accept the regret, accept the present as it is and release the past. I’m supposed to take comfort in my own healing and trust when people say going thru this and doing the work will leave me better off for my next relationship, but I can’t even fathom wanting a relationship with anyone but the man who’s seen me at my worst, who loved me thru pain. I just don’t care to find love again because I know underneath the brokeness of who we were as people was real love and I can hold onto that. 

I’m trying to let a little more go everyday, to feel the feelings and not sit with them for too long, to be honest with myself about where I’m at and be ok with where you’re at and get thru this with dignity, self respect and kindness without embarrassing myself by being the heartbroken ex gf who still feels too much some days. 

So instead I just I write it out in my notes and debate whether to share it. I don’t know if you’d ever read it thru, but maybe one day you’ll want to.

I have finally weighed myself couple of weeks ago and had to face the fact that I got to the 2nd degree obesity. I was terrified because my life consists of huge weight swings and it always ends on the highest weight of my entire life.

Now, on November 12, I started doing low impact walking/dancing cardio workouts. I’m extremely proud of myself because I’m a depressed couch potato. According to my scale I lost 2,5 kg (5 lbs) although I wasn’t counting calories and only cut back on dining out (ramen and korean fried chicken for example).

But my biggest problem is EMOTIONAL EATING and late night eating. Recently I’ve been going through some harder times because 9 months ago I had a nose job and now I’ve been trying to face the fact it didn’t go as planned. So I drink coffee with milk and eat sugar free cookies in the middle of the day. But the late night eating is probably even worse. Right before going to bed I always develop fear that I’ll get hungry before I fall asleep and sometimes I start eating before I even feel hunter just to avoid it because I could never fall asleep being hungry. Sometimes I just start being hungry and try to stop myself from going to the fridge but I always go and eat more than I need and there is no chance to digest it before falling asleep. The sometimes I wake up feeling hangover.

I worked at a check processing place, and every morning I would have a cup of coffee and a package of cookies - either Famous Amos or a little 6-pack of Oreos.  Breakfast of champions.  One morning, one of my coworkers gave me a package of Oreos, since she’d bought one too many from the vending machine.

Great, thanks!  I opened it up, and twisted the cookies apart as normal.  She gave me the MOST stunned and disgusted look.  “WHAT are you DOING???”

“Eating… a cookie?”

“Why did you DO that to it?”

I laughed a little, because at this time I’m assuming it’s just cultural differences, but not understanding how frustrated she is (she was new to the US - had come about 5 years before).  I said, “This is how you eat Oreos!”

“No!”

Laughing again.  “Yes, they have commercials and every-“

“I’m NEVER buying you Oreos again!!”

I'm 34f and I'm married to 38m. We've been married for less than a year and I really love my husband. We are generally happy in our relationship, however, my husband has a 12 year old daughter who just can't stand me.
I don't know how else to explain it but she wants me to leave and she's doing everything to make it happen.
Ever since we started dating and I met his daughter she never liked me. I thought it was idk maybe because I'm dating her dad and she's sad her parents divorced but it has gotten worse. Before we got married and we weren't living together, I wasn't around her really, I mean I did meet her and occasionally saw her and she was rude to me every time. Since we moved in together and she's been spending more time at our house than her mom's, she started being more rude and straight up evil. 
She started being more openly rude to me but not around her dad, she's just rude to me when he's not around. 
She wants to make it seem like I'm being mean to her like for example, I was working on a really important paper for my job and as I was writing last bit, I left my laptop on table and went to toilet and when I came back the whole document was gone. It was deleted from my profile on Microsoft word and even from computer memory. Even the recycle bin was empty which means someone had to completely delete it. 
Me and her were the only people inside the house and her dad was outside. I asked her not did she do it, but why did she do it because she was the only one in the house and she started yelling so that her dad would hear and come back in. She said how I'm always accusing her of something and straight up lied. 
Her dad actually told her she cant be doing that and she went back to her room.
I still lost my paper though.
That was just one of the numerous things she did, for example, she locked me out on balcony, she put my phone in water but it survived, she hides my stuff like my car keys or things I bring with me when I have to leave the house in a rush just to make me mad. It's absurd honestly, most of the things are just plain annoying and not harmful but the thing that definitely made me decide to leave and divorce from her dad is when she made coffee for him and and me, which is not something she really does, at least not for me. But she made me a cup of coffee and I was confused why she was being nice. Thankfully I jokingly thought ""it must be poisoned"" and stired the coffee and found a big piece of glass inside. I showed it to my husband and he was absolutely mad and yelled at her but I don't think that's enough for me to stay. I don't feel safe anymore, like if I didn't stir that coffee I would probably end up cutting my throat with glass or swallowimg it. It's not just a harmless prank it was really fucked up and serious this time. 
I already told my husband I can't stay in the same house with her because she obviously wants me gone. 
I simply don't want to stay and I know I cant make him like leave his daughter or whatever. I think this is the only solution because I'm not going to risk her doing something more and actually hurting me this time. ",66,1733020952.0,AITAH,78,0.89,False
1h3t7lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/1h3t7lg/how_nano_xno_could_go_viral_without_inflation/,"How Nano ($XNO) Could Go Viral Without Inflation, Mining, or Fees","Nano is unique in the crypto space because it doesn’t rely on inflation, mining rewards, or transaction fees. While these features make it eco-friendly and scalable, they also mean Nano lacks some of the game theory mechanics other cryptos use to attract attention and incentize holding.

But what if we could help nano gain attention by rewarding its community in innovative ways? 

Here are a few ideas to spark discussion:
	
1.	Business Profit-Sharing for Nano Holders

Imagine if a business (centralized or decentralized) donated a portion of its profits to Nano holders with 133+ XNO in their wallets. It could act like a loyalty reward system, tying Nano adoption to real-world business success. For example, a business generating revenue in Nano could commit to distributing 5% of its profits to eligible wallets every quarter. This would incentivize people to hold Nano and promote businesses accepting it.
	
2.	Decentralized Donation Redistribution

What if we had a Nano donation address where anyone could contribute? The funds collected would then be automatically distributed among all Nano wallets holding 133+ XNO. This could be used for community-building efforts, charitable causes, or simply as a way to reward long-term holders. By making donations transparent and automated, we could foster a sense of collaboration and shared purpose within the Nano community.
	
3.	Crowdfunding Incentives

Projects using Nano for crowdfunding could reward supporters who also hold 133+ XNO. For example, early backers could receive a small share of future revenues or even bonus Nano for their support. This would strengthen Nano’s use case in the crowdfunding space and encourage community members to participate in building new projects.
	

4.	Viral “Nano Giveback” Campaigns

Nano could gain attention through community-driven donation campaigns. Here’s how it could work: A group donates Nano to a charity or cause. In return, wallets holding 133+ XNO get a small reward for amplifying the effort. This ties generosity to rewards and encourages social sharing, helping spread Nano’s value proposition to a wider audience.
	
5.	Decentralized Loyalty Programs

Businesses accepting Nano could create loyalty programs where customers earn rewards for using Nano in transactions. A portion of these rewards could also be shared with holders of 133+ XNO, incentivizing both spending and holding. For example, a coffee shop accepting Nano could offer discounts to users while also giving small rewards to Nano holders, fostering a circular economy.

Why 133 XNO?

Setting a threshold ensures that rewards go to committed holders rather than spammers or inactive wallets. It also encourages more people to accumulate and hold Nano, further strengthening the network and community engagement.

Let’s Brainstorm Together

These are just a few ideas to get the ball rolling. The goal is to take advantage of Nano’s eco-friendly, fee-less, and instant transaction model to drive adoption and build a thriving community.

What do you think? Are there other creative ways Nano could gain adoption and reward its holders? Let’s discuss!

Feel free to share your thoughts, critique these ideas, or suggest new ones. Together, we can shape the future of Nano and help it gain the attention it deserves!",22,1733020891.0,nanocurrency,2,0.96,False

1h3t6o6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stepmom/comments/1h3t6o6/fil_hit_my_bs_because_he_needs_to_stop_bullying_sd/,"FIL hit my BS because he ""needs to stop bullying SD""","Tldr; FIL hit my BS on the leg hard enough for us to hear because he grabbed SD's hair (they act like siblings and getting physical with one another on occasion is nothing new and we are working on it but they're both 3).

For context, SO and I have lived together for a year. We treat both kids as our own 100% of the time and the kids fight and argue like siblings, SD even introduces BS as her ""bubby"". They are both equally guilty of it, but SD makes it more known when BS does it. She's a very whiney kid and will sometimes run up to us crying and tattling on BS for just existing on the other side of the room. We practice authoritative parenting and do not hit our kids except for an emergency smacking a hand away from a dangerous object (orrrr the time I reflexively punched BS because he tried to hand me a spider lol). SO and I are not married but I'll be referring to his parents as MIL and FIL for simplicity.

I haven't been on friendly terms with my stepdad for over a year and just started talking to him again after giving him major cold shoulder for almost two months (he hates my child and I simply because he's a whiney man child that my mom needs to leave - I'm not even a bad step daughter, I'm 25 and live my own life and just spend time with my mom 1-2 times a month). On Thanksgiving, after SO's parent left (who I invited and cooked for), he shoved my BS. I immediately went off on him and removed everyone from that situation. So, I was already sensitive and heated from this situation as it was just two days ago.

SD had spent the night with MIL. We picked her up, took both kids (3) to a Bluey meet and greet in MIL's town before returning as SD's BM was picking her up later that day from MIL (we have 50/50 of SD but 60% of the time so SO often allows SD to spend time with M/FIL).

They had been bickering and being siblings for an hour. BS had been a bit worse today and had been corrected once over sharing. However, SD had been bad about it too as she screamed at BS and cried because he grabbed HIS cup of ""kid coffee"", which she knew was his cup (just to put into perspective how much she tattles and whines about him, he was on the other side of the room the other day watching TV and reached for HIS cat to pet her and SD came in the kitchen screaming and sobbing because she wanted her). Just so we're all aware that they're both like this and neither are little angels.

M/FIL absolutely favor SD. I understand, that their bio grandkid, but they're sometimes very unfair with their treatment of BS. They show this pretty well, ever since BS went through a biting phase earlier this year. We didn't have any custody at the time and MIL tried to get SO to kick us out as BM was keeping SD from SO if BS was there (he wasn't even 3 at the time and it got corrected). We now have 50/50 custody and SD 60% of the time. I was in the middle of texting my sister to vent about how, whenever we were over there, it felt like me against them about my BS vs SD as they never correct SD but constantly correct BS. Before this, MIL even raised her voice at BS for getting too close to the Christmas tree, despite him not knowing better, when she had correct SD very gently before then (which BS was in the bathroom for).

They were each playing with a climbing frame. They were on top and under it. First, it was that BS ""shoved"" SD out of it. He did not, she was about to climb under it when he climbed under first. He was told to wait his turn and slow down as an initial warning. Next, BS was laying under it by himself when SD tried to flip it over because she was mad about the previous incident. BS grabbed her hair through the bars. Just grabbed. Didn't pull, just held onto it but SD started to cry (rightfully so this time). BS let go as soon as SO said ""BS! Let go of SD's hair."" He would've gone to time out for this had I had the chance. Instead, FIL leaned down and smacked him on the leg. I immediately stood, grabbed my BS and left the house. I heard SO start yelling at FIL and FIL said, ""BS needs to stop bullying her!"", to which SO replied that SD does the SAME stuff to BS, he just never sees it. MIL kept trying to get SO to sit down and basically get over it. I got BS in the car and returned to grab his shoes. I was already sensitive from my step dad pushing my son and I burst, I yelled at him (which is very much like me as I'm confrontational but I'm also quiet and pretty easy going so I'm sure it was a surprise to M/FIL). 

Now, I'm not sure what to do. I've never been more than cordial with SO's family as I'm shy, they're a bit older, and over BS's biting phase and I don't think they ever forgave that. I don't think I want to go over there anymore but I also want a healthy relationship with my MIL as I plan on marrying this man one day and we want an ours baby as well.

SO texted FIL after we got home, saying, ""What made you think it was okay to hit one of my kids?"". FIL tried to apologize, however, this is not the first time he's ""tapped"" (FIL's words) one of our kids, though he's been gentler and more discrete and I never said anything because it was never BS and SO didn't say anything. I think he only apologized because MIL got mad at him once SO said that he wouldn't be going over there anymore if FIL was there (FIL is not SO's BD). I don't think it's my place to correct his parents, even if I don't agree with it (that is, until it comes to my son getting hurt).

I am just so sick of the favoritism. I know it's their bio but you could stop making it so obvious? My mom doesn't see SD much but, even though she favors BS, she treats them the same when they're around. My mom mildly dislikes SD (and my entire family, actually - even my kid obsessed great granny is driven nuts by her) because she's just awful whiney. Even my sister, who's been babysitting and around kids since she was old enough to microwave ramen noodles and change a diaper has said that she's the whiniest and most difficult kid to be around that she's ever met. They don't see what SD is actually like though. SO does but his parents don't. Not that BS is perfect, he's far from it. He can be aggressive and bossy, he's very loud and demanding. He's just a high energy, conquer the world kid.",0,1733020804.0,Stepmom,3,0.2,False

This past month I’ve slowly been getting pictures of memories I had somehow forgotten, mostly of some of the more physical abuse I had gone through at her hand, but definitely a lot of mental things as well. I don’t know where to start, and I’m sure much more will surface in time. 

I guess I can start with some of the physical incidents that leave me shocked when thinking back to them. The first major incident I can recall was when I was (maybe) 5, and my sister one year younger, woke up early-ish (no earlier than 7 for sure) but before my mother who slept in the next room. Well, to pass time we were giggling and such, nothing major in my eyes for two young girls, but oops! We woke up mom, (I still blank on what happened in between) she came into the room with a roll of duct tape, taped our hands together and taped our mouths shut. I have restricted airways and it is extremely difficult for me to breathe through my nose, but fortunately, my problems weren’t so bad at such a young age and I had little issues breathing. We were like that about an hour. Maybe 5-6 years later, after a large scary storm (I wasn’t sleeping and my older sister came to get me to come downstairs. It was before midnight and I think I had run into something making a bit of noise, my mom rushed down the hallway and pinned me to the wall choking me, letting me go after a minute. By this time of my life I was responsible for waking up my younger sister and brother for school so my mother could sleep in (who was unemployed through much of my childhood). (My older sister (2 years older) never had responsibilities towards myself or the other siblings and barely around the house as well, so from a young age age I was very much responsible for my younger siblings as well as the house in many ways) Well, upon waking up my siblings we had to be as quiet as humanly possible, and my mother would wake up at some point while we were in the kitchen usually. We were reprimanded and told not to talk to her until she had a coffee at least… you couldn’t even make eye contact with her or say hi/good morning to her or she would become unraveled. The look on her face alone was enough to keep from talking, and at night I wasn’t allowed to have my radio on (as low as it could possibly go, I could barely hear it) because she couldn’t sleep, she could hear it through the vents as my room was then below hers. 

My mother loved to dole out spankings, for so many reasons I can’t even remember. One time, when I was 6, my older friend had convinced me to cross the tracks with her even though I didn’t want to. We were witnessed and ratted on. When I got home my mother was furious and she chased me around the house, I knew what was coming, I hid under beds and begged my father to not let her get me, but he did. She took her anger out on my butt and grounded me to my room for a month. I was the best behaved child of 4, and was always punished way worse than anyone else. There was one incident where my little brother mentioned being spanked at school. Social services came to the house and we were given family counselling for a while and my mom was told that spanking is not allowed. During most of the sessions my mother flat out made herself the victim in every situation. It was always about her feelings. Some other punishments included going to bed hungry or sitting on your knees in a corner for hours. So I suppose she stopped the physical stuff after that in fear, but the emotional abuse never ended, but I’ll save for another time! ",30,1733020788.0,raisedbynarcissists,34,1.0,False

I figured I’d hammer out the kinks here so I won’t have to worry about the logic when programming it unreal/unity. It essentially works like this:

The player has a “Notes” menu in a similar way an “inventory” works. But instead of items, the notes tab has statements that can be collected. The character can make observations by examining items, people, places, or through dialogue. For example the player can click on John’s green shirt, which would add a “Statement” to their “Notes” menu. Maybe like this:


**Statement Added**
1) John is wearing a green shirt


It’s collected through dialogue automatically based on the dialogue choices the player makes:


Rebecca- “Im such an idiot, I spilled my coffee”

**statement added**

2) Rebecca spilled her coffee


The statements would be compiled for the player to go through and would include relevant information, irrelevant information (eg johns green shirt), and red herrings.


“Statements” can then be used to form “Thoughts”. In the same “Notes” menu, the player can combine two statements with a conjunction to form a thought, which can be combined with evidence, or presented in dialogue (this is where the “crafting” system comes into play). There will be three drop down menus one for a statment on the left and right and a middle drop down for a list of combining words like “because, after, so, and, while” etc.

So something like this:

-NOTES-

Observations 
            1. John wore a green shirt.
            2. Rebecca spilled her coffee.

Thoughts

1 [BECAUSE] 2


Now during dialogue if another character asks why John is wearing a green shirt, the player can present that thought to them.

The point is to create a system that’s more interactive and requires thinking rather than just pressing buttons to get the answer or handholding the player to it, like many detective games end up being. Ofc it’ll be supplemented with rewards and consequences, but this is the bare bones mechanic.

So from this concept I’m not sure what the best way to move forward is. I can treat statements like items and have the game add them to players notes “inventory” when conditions are met:


If (Rebecca says “I spilled my coffee”
    Add “Rebecca spilled her coffee” to notes

;

And just do that for all statements collected. I don’t know if that’s efficient though to have that many items. Additionally for the combining mechanic my initial thought was just to use a nesting conditional.


So my inquiry boils down to, how can I work to make this doable? Are there any problems with my thought process? Anything to help it go smoother? I’m not a great programmer and I have severe brain fog atm so anything helps lol

(I don’t snack that much anymore and hardly have any pop if I do it’s one can. I do have coffee but I usually don’t drink it all and only have one also.) ",2,1733020008.0,Hashimotos,3,1.0,False

Female, 22 y/o, 150 lbs. So yea as the title says, for the past 2 weeks I’ve developed a bit of a more frequent urge to urinate and when I do not a lot comes out even if I drink alot of water and I feel like I’m not fully empty after I urinate. Then like 30 min later I’ll feel like I have to go again and the same thing happens again. I have no pain or burning in my bladder/urethra at any time and especially none when I’m urinating. I feel like my urine is always a slightly pale green all the time too. So I don’t think this is a UTI bc nothing hurts or burns, but this has been annoying me for two weeks I even stopped drinking anything that irritates the bladder like coffee. So what could this possibly be? Should I be worried? Is this overactive bladder or possible interstitial cystitis? I would appreciate any kind of help with this. ",1,1733019881.0,AskDocs,4,1.0,False

Hello all, 

I am recently divorced. I work a lot. I’m an introverted extrovert. I have a beard and tattoos. I’m rough on the edges. I swear a lot. Looking to connect with somebody who’s serious about getting to know one another who values trust honesty, and communication and is super kind to others. I am attracted to all races, creeds, religions and nationalities. I do prefer woman who have curves. I’m also an ass man so bonus points if you’re a cutie with a bootie. I know I know, super cheesy. But that’s me. I have a fairly stable life. I drive, have my own place, have my shit together. I don’t smoke, drink or do drugs but I’m not against people who do. If your weekends are all about going out, drinking and shit like that, it probably ain’t going to work. 
A bit more about me below ⬇️ 

* 41, Caucasian, 6’1
* Super chill & friendly 
* Best smelling guy you’ll meet. Period. 
* I’m a Dad of 2 beautiful kids. 
* I’m a big nerd, love space and comics, sci fi and horror. Games. 
* Lover of Coffee
* Nature walks & Hikes are my jam. I love to throw on my AirPods, find a trail and just go. 

Can send a SFW pic if you are willing too also! Hoping to connect with you! 

Lastly, I know what I want & I know what I’m ready for. I’m getting tired of people telling ME that I’m not ready for something. The only person who can truly know that is myself. Same goes for you. I don’t want a penpal and I don’t want to waste anyone’s time.  

I am looking for WOMEN ONLY. 
Men, please stop asking. One more thing. Please be free and unattached from your exs. Please don’t live with your ex still, and don’t be “on and off” with your ex 😡 

If you co parent, cool, so do I, but it’s actually crazy how many people aren’t fully detached from their ex’s. I know this is long but if you’ve made it this far, I hope to hear from you! 

Lastly……stop ghosting!! I’m a big boy, if you aren’t interested, cool, just say so!! Phew. Thanks for reading my novel ✌️",1,1733019822.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False
1h3sw2b,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1h3sw2b/aita_for_making_french_toast_with_corn_starch/,AITA for making French toast with corn starch instead of eggs? ,"I usually make French toast with eggs, but my parents have dietary restrictions, so I decided to use corn starch to accommodate them.  We had turkey, chicken kebabs for thanksgiving, my parents didn't eat that because they don't eat meat. So I felt an extra incentive to accommodate them. My wife has no dietary restrictions and typically prefers the traditional egg-based version. My wife usually likes my French toast.

This morning, I made French toast with brioche bread, corn starch, served it with sides of strawberries, raspberries, and maple syrup. I also made a vanilla latte that she likes and brought it to my wife in bed as a nice gesture. However, she didn't eat it and instead complained about the fact that I didn't use eggs. I tried explaining to her that I did that to accomodate my parents, she felt that I shouldn't call this a French toast because there are no eggs and I shouldn't have told her I was making a French toast. Unfortunately we ran out of eggs after thanksgiving and I couldn't make a batter with eggs for her. She didn't eat it, she let it out in the cold and 30 minutes later, she just ate plain bread. Meanwhile, my parents, brother-in-law, and sister enjoyed the French toast and the coffees and were very appreciative of me. I felt hurt by her reaction since I put in the effort to make something that would work for everyone. 

Her disappointment felt like a slap in the face after my efforts. It took me close to two hours to cook and clean early in the morning. The batter was well proportioned and I added whipping cream, nutmeg to make it even tastier. In terms of taste and texture, it felt as good as my previous French toast. I wanted to do it as a warm gesture for everyone to recover from thanksgiving hangover.. I understand that she has her preferences, but I can't help but feel that she was being completely unreasonable and inconsiderate in this situation and we argued because I felt she was clearly on the wrong here. 

So reddit, AITA for making the French toast with corn starch instead of eggs?

EDIT: Cornstarch does bind milk to bread, I was following the recipe from some food blogs.

1h3svrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1h3svrh/is_he_into_me/,Is he into me?,"(F20, M21) Ive known this guy in uni for a little over a year now but we've never talked much, only sometimes at a train station cause we were the only ones there from uni. Back then he would ask me if I'm going to catch the train. He mostly initiated conversations because I was very shy, even tho there weren't many of them. This semester things changed. I've realised I really like him. He asked me to do a project together and I've opened up a lot so we've talked more freely and light heartedly. About a month ago I realised he looks at me differently. It's a longer look with a genuine smile, not some quick look, half smile and look away just to be polite. He looks at me whenever I walk past him. He checks if I've come back to class after recess. He's become touchy feely and he doesn't do that with other girls. One day we were leaving together but going in different directions. When we are alone we hug hello and goodbye but we've never done that in front of other people. And that day there were other students around us but he looked at me kinda dreamy as if he was waiting til I hug him but it was too late after I realised. I guess I fucked up. I asked him if he wants to grab a coffee last Wednesday and he agreed but informed me that everybody is sick at work and doesn't know if he'll have to go - eventually he did have to work and while telling me he said that ""we can even go with X"" (my best friend at uni, all 3 of us have a project together). So I told him ""alright, next time you're inviting me ;)"" so that he knows the ball is in his court. That was also the only time he texted me first. Idk why he asked about her since he picked up on the fact that we were supposed to go alone. Did he not want to go alone or did he think that X comes with the package? He also doesn't ask if I'm going to the train station anymore. At first I thought he might be into me at least a little but now I'm wondering whether I'm getting mixed signals or feeding my delusions... He doesn't seem like the kinda guy that's ever had a girlfriend so maybe he's trying to hide it if he's even interested. But he's not shy at all as well.",1,1733019791.0,dating,2,1.0,False

Is the whole 'pro as a status symbol' no longer a thing? Do too many students have the 'Air' so a working professional has to have a Pro to prove they are successful? Would you prefer to be seen in a coffee shop with a Pro rather than the all too common Air? Isn't caring about this passé?

I ask because older folks will recall this used to be a thing. In other countries and particularly in Asia there's even the idea of a 'Mac person' on who can afford expensive apple gadgets and so on.

In this context I think the Midnight Air and the Space Black Pro are better colors so from a distance they could be mistaken for Windows machines and you cant be labeled a mac person. Ha ha.",2,1733019756.0,macbook,4,0.75,False
