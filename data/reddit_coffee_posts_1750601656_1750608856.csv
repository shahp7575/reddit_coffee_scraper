# Murder of Betsy Aardsma

\[Information gathered from: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder\_of\_Betsy\_Aardsma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Betsy_Aardsma) \]

The **murder of Betsy Aardsma** is an American murder case dating from November 1969, in which a 22-year-old graduate student was murdered by a single stab wound inside the [Pattee Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University_Libraries#Pattee_Library) at the [Pennsylvania State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University) (Penn State) in [University Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Park,_Pennsylvania), [Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania).

Though Aardsma's murder remains officially [unsolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case), local investigative journalists and two independent authors have published testimony and reports which strongly indicate Penn State [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology) professor Richard Haefner may have been responsible for her death, which has been described by one author as Pennsylvania's most infamous unsolved murder.

The evidence indicating Haefner's guilt of Aardsma's murder is [circumstantial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence). Haefner was never charged with her murder. He died in 2002.

**Early life**

Elizabeth Ruth ""Betsy"" Aardsma was the second of four children. She was born in [Holland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland,_Michigan), [Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan), to Esther and Richard Aardsma, and raised in a middle-class, religious and [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism) household on West 37th Street. Aardsma's father was a sales tax auditor for the [Michigan State Treasurer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_Treasurer), while her mother was a housewife.

As a child, Aardsma displayed a flair for art and poetry. By adolescence, she had developed somewhat [liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism) ideals and displayed a concern for the underprivileged. Aardsma attended [Holland High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_High_School_(Michigan)) and performed well academically, graduating with honors in 1965.

**Further education**

Shortly after graduating from high school, Aardsma enrolled in [Hope College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_College) in the fall of 1965 with aspirations to become a physician. Her roommate, Linda DenBesten, later recollected Aardsma as an intelligent and fascinating individual who exhibited [feminist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism) traits.

In the fall of 1967, Aardsma enrolled at the [University of Michigan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan), studying art and English and sharing an apartment with three other female students. By her senior year, she had begun dating a medical student named David Wright, who by all accounts was her first serious boyfriend. She graduated from this institution with honors in the summer of 1969.

**Pennsylvania State University**

Upon graduation from the University of Michigan, Aardsma initially intended to join the [Peace Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Corps) and travel to Africa, although she opted to enroll at [Pennsylvania State University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University) (Penn State) when she discovered that Wright, her boyfriend, intended to study there and that he could not guarantee he would remain loyal to her if she traveled abroad for any significant length of time.

Aardsma enrolled at Penn State in early October 1969. She resided on [campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus) in [Atherton Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pennsylvania_State_University_residence_halls), and shared her residence with a student named Sharon Brandt, who would later recall that Aardsma seldom pursued extracurricular activities and spent much of her free time either studying or—at weekends—traveling to [Penn State Hershey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penn_State_Milton_S._Hershey_Medical_Center) to be in the company of Wright.

By [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving), Aardsma is known to have exhibited symptoms of stress due to the fact she had fallen behind on an English assignment. She spent the day prior to Thanksgiving in the company of her boyfriend, his roommates and their girlfriends before returning to her dormitory the following day, with intentions to meet her professors for advice on a research paper she needed to complete for her assignment. Wright drove Aardsma to a nearby bus stop in [Harrisburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrisburg,_Pennsylvania) on the afternoon of November 27.

At the time of her death, Aardsma had been in a relationship with Wright for approximately one year, and the two had discussed plans to become [engaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engagement) by Christmas. She had been a student at Penn State for just eight weeks when she was murdered.

[The Pattee Library](https://preview.redd.it/tmfzwdpa4i8f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab0ef49f801bdef7e043047ac9901f88ae94fc80)

**November 28, 1969**  
On the afternoon of November 28, 1969, Aardsma and Brandt left their residence to visit Penn State's [Pattee Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University_Libraries#Pattee_Library) to obtain research material for her English paper. En route, the two parted company, having formed plans to reconvene later that afternoon to watch either [*Easy Rider*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider) or [*Take the Money and Run*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_the_Money_and_Run_(film)) at a movie theater that evening. At approximately 4 p.m., Aardsma spoke with one of her professors, Nicholas Joukovsky, to whom she stated her intentions to visit the Stack Building. Shortly thereafter, she encountered two friends, Linda Marsa and Robert Steinberg, with whom she briefly conversed before entering the library. She then placed her purse, jacket, and a book inside a [carrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrel_desk) assigned to her before walking toward a card catalog. Having found the reference she sought, Aardsma walked down a flight of stairs into the Level 2 core stacks at approximately 4:30 p.m.

The final potential sightings of Aardsma in the Level 2 core stacks occurred minutes after 4:30 p.m., when an assistant supervisor named Dean Brungart observed a girl in a red dress standing alone in an aisle, with two young men talking quietly among themselves in a nearby aisle closer to the west end of the core. Approximately ten minutes later, another witness, Richard Allen, overheard a conversation between a male and a female in the general direction of where Aardsma stood as he operated a [photocopier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photocopier). Although Allen could not hear what the two spoke, he informed police nothing sounded untoward. Moments later, Allen heard a metallic crashing noise before a young man whom he described as ""looking like a student"" ran ""barrelling"" past him.

[The Stacks, seen here in 2006](https://preview.redd.it/mgewhuti4i8f1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=07515fefe7993135c8434954dbb76e5427692065)

**Murder**  
At some point between 4:45 and 4:55 p.m., Aardsma was stabbed a single time through the left breast with a knife while standing between rows 50 and 51 in the dimly lit Stack Building of the Pattee Library. This wound severed her [pulmonary artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_artery) and pierced the [right ventricle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)) of her heart. Following the stabbing, Aardsma slumped to the ground close to the end of the aisle, pulling several books off adjacent shelves as she fell onto her back. Two students—Joao Uafinda and Marilee Erdley—then observed a man running from the direction of the commotion, concealing his right hand, exclaiming, ""That girl needs help!"" Erdley described this man as being dressed in khaki washable slacks, a tie, and a sports jacket. He had well-kept brown hair, was approximately 6 ft in height, about 185 lbs, and may have been wearing glasses. This individual led Uafinda and Erdley into the Core, where he pointed toward the prone body of Aardsma lying between scattered books and metal shelves which had also been knocked loose. As Erdley began to check for signs of a [pulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse), Uafinda observed this individual leaving the library; he discreetly followed the man upstairs, where the individual ran out of the library. Uafinda attempted to chase this man but was outpaced. This individual was last seen running in the direction of the Recreation Hall.

Subsequent police appeals for the man or men who spoke these words to Uafinda and Erdley before fleeing from the library to come forward were unsuccessful, and the individual has never been identified.

**Medical efforts**

As Uafinda attempted to pursue the individual fleeing the library, Erdley attempted to render first aid to Aardsma, including [mouth-to-mouth resuscitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth-to-mouth_resuscitation), and was soon joined by a group of bystanders, including a librarian. A call was placed to the campus hospital, the Ritenour Health Center, at 5:01 p.m., with responders initially informed a ""girl had [fainted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine))"" in the Pattee Library. Two student [paramedics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic) were dispatched to the scene, arriving minutes later. Aardsma was quickly placed on a gurney and removed from the library via a service elevator, to be taken to the Health Center, as the paramedics continued to perform [cardiopulmonary resuscitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation) (CPR) upon her. The summoned ambulance transported Aardsma to the Health Center.

Although Aardsma was wearing a white turtleneck sweater at the time she was stabbed, the wound produced only a small amount of visible blood. However, Aardsma was also wearing a red sleeveless dress over this sweater at the time of her murder, and the clothing she wore had been of thick material in the November climate, thus meaning the single knife tear within her clothing was not immediately obvious. She had also urinated where she fell. As result of these facts, the non-medical individuals who discovered her body—plus the student first responders summoned to the scene in response to reports of a female student having ""fainted"" in the library—initially believed that she had indeed either fainted, experienced a [seizure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure), or some other non-critical medical ailment.

Very shortly after Aardsma was transported to the Health Center, a more senior medical individual observed blood seeping through her clothing as the two student paramedics continued to perform CPR and immediately ordered the two to stop before locating the single stab wound. Aardsma was pronounced dead by a physician at 5:50 p.m.

**Autopsy**

Aardsma's [autopsy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy) was conducted by Dr. Thomas Magnani at Bellefonte Hospital in [Bellefonte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellefonte,_Pennsylvania) at 11 p.m. on November 28, concluding at 4 a.m. the following morning. Magnani concluded Aardsma had been killed by a single stab wound which had penetrated her [breastbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastbone), piercing her heart and severing her pulmonary artery, causing extensive hemorrhaging into her chest cavity. Death had occurred within five minutes, and Aardsma would have been unable to scream for help as she essentially drowned in her own blood. Furthermore, she had not been subjected to any form of [sexual assault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault).

Signs of [petechial hemorrhaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petechia) were also discovered on Aardsma's chest, and minor signs of bruising and abrasions noted around one ear had likely been caused as she fell to the ground. Magnani further opined his belief Aardsma's murderer had intentionally aimed for her heart when he had stabbed her while facing her, and that her assailant was a right-handed individual.

**Investigation**

[Pennsylvania State Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_Police) assigned approximately thirty-five [troopers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trooper_(police_rank)) to investigate Aardsma's murder. These troopers were assigned usage of the Boucke Building as a temporary command center as they conducted inquiries, and hundreds of students were interviewed in the weeks following her death. The entire campus was unsuccessfully searched in an effort to locate the murder weapon, and a $25,000 (the equivalent of approximately $217,300 as of 2025) reward was offered for information leading to the arrest of Aardsma's killer. Investigators would soon discover up to 400 individuals would typically enter or exit the Pattee Library between 4:30 and 5:00 p.m. on a Friday, although on the date in question, only about 90 had done so. None of those interviewed were considered viable suspects.

Two [composite sketches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_composite) of the individual Uafinda and Erdley had seen running from the direction of Aardsma's stabbing were created—one with the assistance of Uafinda and a library desk clerk; one with Erdley—although only Erdley's identikit image was released to the media.

Before police had even been notified of Aardsma's death, the crime scene was compromised as library staff—believing Aardsma had fainted or fallen—had ordered janitors to clean the urine from the tile flooring of the aisle, fix the shelving and restack the fallen books. As such, any physical evidence potentially left by the murderer at the scene was destroyed or compromised. However, the first trooper to visit the crime scene, Mike Simmers, ordered the area secured. A series of small, fresh blood droplets matching Aardsma's [blood type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type) were recovered from the staircase leading into the Level 3 core stacks, indicating her murderer had left the library via this route.

https://preview.redd.it/en0y5vqh5i8f1.png?width=521&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b15d9c7cd80a4339c5a40ada7de271d5955782

Several factors in the circumstances surrounding Aardsma's death led police to believe she had likely known her murderer, as she had evidently been approached from the front by her assailant within a row too narrow for one individual to pass another unless one of the two turned sideways, and had made no attempt to scream or flee. Exhaustive research and questioning also led investigators to discount any possibility she had been [stalked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking), and she had not been expected to be at Penn State that day, but with Wright, who was quickly eliminated from the inquiry. Moreover, although Aardsma had recently expressed incipient concerns about potentially becoming a ""physician's wife"" and a mother while still young to one acquaintance, none of the entries in her diary, or the letters she regularly wrote to Wright, indicated she had felt reluctant about her relationship prospects, interested in another suitor, or had otherwise felt intimidated and/or uncomfortable during the eight weeks she had been enrolled at Penn State.

Other theories investigated have included the possibility Aardsma may have stumbled upon a [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality) encounter, an [exhibitionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibitionism), or a man engaging in [masturbatory fantasies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_fantasy), and had been murdered to ensure her silence. This theory was given particular credence by investigator Michael Mutch, who speculated Aardsma had observed two men engaged in sexual behavior, had recognized one or both men, and had been murdered to prevent her divulging to others what she had seen.

A few aisles from where Aardsma had been murdered, in a section of the Core used to store desks and spare shelving, investigators observed a desk with a seat pulled backwards. Atop this desk was a half-empty can of soda and a small stack of heterosexual and homosexual [pornographic magazines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_magazine)—some of which dated as recently as October and November 1969. Furthermore, more than two dozen pornographic magazines were found concealed between books in the aisle where she had been murdered, and ample traces of [semen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen) were discovered in multiple locations on the floor, shelves and walls, with one investigator later commenting traces of semen were practically ""everywhere"". These discoveries led investigators to conclude secluded areas of the stacks were used to conduct illicit sexual encounters. Although partial [fingerprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint) were obtained from this can of soda, the prints did not match any within police databases. All fingerprints upon and within the magazines were smudged and unusable.

Other theories investigators considered were the possibility Aardsma may have been murdered by a spurned suitor, had witnessed a drug deal and had been murdered to ensure her silence, or had been murdered due to an unsettled drug debt. However, although Aardsma did smoke cigarettes, and very occasionally drank alcohol, acquaintances were adamant she was not a user of drugs.

Despite several leads of inquiry being pursued and hundreds of potential witnesses interviewed over the span of several years, no individual was arrested for her murder.

**Cold case**

Despite the efforts of Pennsylvania State Police and the president of the university, [Eric Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_A._Walker_(engineer)) (who had conducted his own private investigation into Aardsma's murder), the case gradually became [cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case) and the number of investigators assigned to the case decreased as potential leads to pursue became increasingly scarce. The murder remains unsolved. Records pertaining to the case remain [sealed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_sealing) under the state's Open Records Act. However, Pennsylvania State Police are still actively seeking information on the case.

**Suspects**

**William Spencer**

William Spencer was a 40-year-old [sculptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture) who had relocated to Pennsylvania from [Boston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston) with his second wife shortly before Aardsma's murder. He had previously co-founded the [Caffè Lena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caff%C3%A8_Lena) with his first wife in [Saratoga Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York), [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)), in May 1960, and had recently relocated to Pennsylvania with his second wife, obtaining employment teaching sculpture at a local college as his wife studied for her [Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) Spencer was first reported to police as a potential suspect in Aardsma's murder after allegedly confessing to having ""killed that girl in the library"" at a Christmas 1969 gathering of faculty members. These claims culminated in his being formally questioned by investigators in early 1970.

According to Spencer, he and Aardsma had been acquainted, and she agreed to pose nude for his sculpting classes to earn extra money. He had been in the Level 2 core stacks at the time of her murder, and had seen her murderer, whom he insisted had been wearing an overcoat. He offered to construct a [bust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bust_(sculpture)) of the individual he had seen for investigators, which he later provided to the task force assembled to apprehend her murderer.

Police quickly dismissed Spencer's claims, as he and his wife had relocated to Pennsylvania just weeks prior to Aardsma's murder, thus offering little time for the two to become acquainted. His claims she had been a [nude model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(art)) were never corroborated, and rapidly dismissed by investigators and acquaintances alike, as Aardsma was known to be a [prudish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prude) young woman. Furthermore, all nude models at Spencer's classes are known to have traveled to the university from [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia).

**Larry Maurer**

One student who initially aroused investigators' suspicions was a classmate of Aardsma's named Larry Maurer. Maurer is known to have become acquainted with Aardsma in the weeks before her death, on one occasion taking her for a coffee. No ill-feeling is known to have existed between the two, and Maurer is known to have been cleared as a potential suspect in her murder, although it is unknown whether he actually passed or failed a [polygraph test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph_test). However, Maurer was a blond individual, of average height, who did not wear glasses, making his physical appearance markedly different from that of the individual seen by three eyewitnesses—one of whom had been a classmate of his—running away from the Level 2 core stacks immediately after Aardsma's murder.

**Richard Haefner**

Author Derek Sherwood and [investigative journalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism) David DeKok have each published books focusing upon Aardsma's murder. Both authors strongly believe Penn State professor Richard Charles Haefner–then a 25-year-old [geology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology) student at the university–was responsible for her death, and not Maurer or Spencer.

A well-respected but socially awkward individual, Haefner is known to have taken extreme measures to obtain [platonic relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love) with women to conceal his homosexuality. On one occasion in 1968, he is known to have traveled from Pennsylvania to [Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts) to inform a girl he barely knew he loved her. He had arrived unannounced at her apartment to inform her of this fact, only to be surprised when she slammed the door in his face. Haefner resided across the courtyard from Aardsma at Atherton Hall at the time of her death and was widely known for engaging in erratic behavior, including periodic bouts of explosive anger, and the suspected theft of several specimens from the university's rock and mineral collection. He was known to frequently dress in khaki trousers and a sports coat, and to keep his brown hair short and tidy. His friendship with Aardsma had been terminated by the victim shortly before her death.

Haefner's name had first been mentioned to investigators days after Aardsma's murder when Brandt, her roommate, had suggested to police that they interview him. According to Brandt, Haefner had visited their apartment on more than one occasion in the weeks prior to the murder.

Haefner was questioned by investigators in early December 1969. He freely admitted having become acquainted with Aardsma in late October, and to have occasionally socialized with her, although within approximately one week she had terminated their budding friendship, stating she wished to remain committed to Wright. According to Haefner, he had been eating an evening meal at a [student union building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_center) on the evening of November 28, when he had first heard circulating rumors of a student having been murdered at the Pattee Library. Furthermore, he had subsequently felt physically ill upon learning his ""former girlfriend"" had been the murdered student. Haefner further claimed to have never set foot in the library, as he invariably obtained research material from the [Deike Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University_Libraries#Other_Libraries), where literature related to geology was stored.[^(\[47\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Betsy_Aardsma#cite_note-Haefner-59) The identikit image created by Uafinda and a desk clerk never circulated to the media bears a striking resemblance to Haefner. In addition, Haefner's studying schedule shows he spent the two years following Aardsma's murder studying almost exclusively off campus.

In August 1975, two young boys who worked in Haefner's family rock shop would separately accuse him of having [molested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_molestation) them. Although his subsequent trial resulted in a [hung jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hung_jury), these accusations resulted in his filing a number of subsequent [vindictive lawsuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexatious_litigation). Haefner successfully ensured the [expungement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expungement) of the records pertaining to his arrest and trial in 1981. Several years after Aardsma's murder, an acquaintance of Haefner's named Lauren Wright (no relation to David Wright) would report that shortly after 6 p.m. on the date of Aardsma's murder, Haefner had arrived at his household in a state of exhausted panic, blurting: ""Have you heard? A girl I dated was murdered in the library!"" Having conversed with the Wrights for a short period of time, Haefner left their household. This account contradicts Haefner's official accounts of his movements which he provided to investigators.

Lauren Wright failed to inform investigators of this conversation until 1976, following an argument with Haefner, who by the 1970s had begun to focus his interests upon [volcanology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanology). He remained a close acquaintance of Haefner's until the latter died alone in a hospital bathroom in March 2002. His cause of death was a tear in his [aorta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aorta) which bled into his lungs—a similar manner of death endured by Aardsma.

In 2009, a nephew of Haefner's contacted Sherwood to divulge that on one occasion in approximately 1975, he had overheard a heated conversation between Haefner and his mother, Ere, who had been aware of several accusations of [pederasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty) levelled against her son dating back to 1967. According to this individual, the conversation had occurred shortly after Haefner's 1975 arrest, and his mother had expressed her concerns as to whether police suspected him of having ""killed that girl"" at Penn State. She had also chided him for coming to the attention of the police after ""all \[her\] efforts"" to protect him on the previous occasion. The overall context of this conversation indicated to Haefner's nephew that he had confessed to Aardsma's murder to his mother, who had ended the scolding of her son with the sentence: ""You killed that girl, and now you're killing me!""

**Aftermath**

Betsy Aardsma was laid to rest on December 3, 1969, following a service held at the Trinity Reformed Church in her hometown of Holland, Michigan. Her casket remained open throughout the ceremony prior to her interment, with the Reverend Gordon Van Oostenburg reciting a poem Aardsma had written in 1965 titled ""Why Do I Live?"" during the service. She was buried in the Aardsma family plot within Pilgrim Home Cemetery, with a single rose from David Wright placed in her hands. The final letter Aardsma wrote to Wright had arrived at his address the day after her murder.

Aardsma's murder ultimately became a major factor in the creation of a university police force at Penn State. The years prior to her death had seen an increase in violent crime, sexual assaults, and raucous student protests at the university, which had only a campus patrol to provide immediate law and order. Aardsma's death epitomized the need for increased public safety measures on the university campus, and a university police force was established in the early 1970s.",1,1750608772.0,ColdCaseVault,0,1.0,False

Breakfast and lunch will always be made at home and 5 out of 7 dinners will be too. We order a takeaway or go out a couple of times a week.


We have eggs most days, cheap source of protein and quick to cook. Although we both work from home, we prioritise going outside at lunch time either for a walk or a run so speed is always the priority for lunch. 


I do all of the cooking and partner does all of the washing up. It's a system that's worked well for us for the last 5+ years and I don't see it changing unless our jobs changed and one of us had shift work or a long commute. 


Any dietary requirements?

I have no dietary requirements, partner eats gluten free. We eat a lot of carbs that are already gluten free such as rice and potatoes, but we buy separate pasta and bread as I don't like the texture of theirs. 
They also have reactions to certain fruit and vegetables so we tend to stick to the same 'safe' ones. Repetitive but necessary!



Fave kitchen appliance?

Not an appliance, but a silicone spatula is so useful and is probably the most used utensil in our kitchen. 



Top places to shop?

We go to Aldi as we have one within walking distance, and then for specific items like gluten free bread we will go to Sainsburys. 



How well stocked is your house?

We are well stocked on cupboard items like olive oil, rice, pasta, tea/coffee, chopped tomatoes and spices etc. 


We do not have a large freezer so we cook only what we can eat that meal.

A’gust of Sashi 

HYDERABAD
June, 2006

“Nandu, why didn’t you go? Why don’t you
answer me?” Dvithi’s voice cracked with
frustration as she stared at me, her hands
clenched into fists. “Do you even know how
much effort it took me to set up this interview for
you? What’s the point of your medical degree if
you won’t use it to build a career?”

I sat on the couch, silent, staring at the floor,
unable to meet her eyes.

“I’m done,” she said finally, her voice breaking.
“I don’t think there’s a future for us anymore.”

With that, Dvithi walked out of the house, leaving
me alone with the weight of her words. I didn’t
cry. I didn’t shout. I just felt... numb. My body
moved on its own as I lay down on the bed,
staring at the ceiling, until exhaustion pulled me
into a restless sleep.

I was woken by the sound of my phone ringing.
Groggily, I answered it, my voice rough.

“Yeah, I’ll pick her up tomorrow from the
airport,” I said before ending the call. I didn’t
want to think about who “she” was or why this
responsibility suddenly felt monumental.
Instead, I reached for the only comfort I knew—
alcohol.

At the bar, the familiar burn of whiskey did little
to numb the ache inside me. Before long, I was
too drunk to think straight. Fumbling with my
phone, I called Kunal.

“Kunal,” I slurred, “where are you? Come pick
me up. I can’t go home like this.”

There was a pause before his steady voice
responded, “I just got off duty. I’ll be there in a
few minutes.”

True to his word, Kunal arrived, still in his police
uniform, his face weary from a long shift. He
helped me into the car, shaking his head.

“Dude, I’m a cop, not your personal driver,” he
said, though there was a teasing edge to his
tone.

“You’re the only friend I’ve got,” I said, my
words slurring but heavy with truth. “You know
what? Even Dvithi left me today. Can you believe
that? She’s gone. How funny is that?”

Kunal didn’t laugh. Instead, he sighed, his hands
tightening on the steering wheel. “Stay at my
place tonight. You shouldn’t be alone right now.”

I nodded silently, my head resting against the
car window, too tired and drunk to argue.

The next morning, Kunal dropped me off at my
apartment. As we pulled into the driveway, my
heart sank. There she was—Dvithi—moving her

belongings out of the house. She didn’t say a
word. Neither did I.

Kunal gave me a pat on the back before driving
away. I walked inside, the once-warm home now
feeling unbearably empty. Instead of getting
ready for the job I had, one so insignificant it
hardly mattered, I collapsed onto the bed and
slept the day away.

When I finally woke up, it was late afternoon,
and panic set in. I was supposed to pick
someone up from the airport. I scrambled out of
bed, throwing on clothes, and drove as fast as I
could.

By the time I arrived, the flight had already
landed. Standing in the waiting area, I scanned
the crowd until my eyes fell on her—Sashi.

She was small, maybe ten years old, clutching a
worn Harry Potter book to her chest. She stood
next to an older man holding her luggage. The
man handed me the bag without a word and

walked away, leaving the two of us standing
there.

“Hi, Shashi,” I said awkwardly, my voice soft.

She looked up at me, her eyes wide and curious,
and gave a small nod. Without a word, she
followed me to the car.

The drive home was silent, save for the sound of
her flipping pages in her book. I glanced at her
every now and then, wondering what she
thought of me—this disheveled, broken man.
Despite everything, I felt a faint flicker of
responsibility, a sense that maybe, just maybe, I
needed to pull myself together. For her.

Tabula Rasa

When we arrived home, I stepped inside and
turned back to see Sashi lingering at the
doorway. She clutched her Harry Potter book
tightly in one hand while her other hand
nervously adjusted the strap of her small
backpack. Her eyes were fixed on the floor, and
she made no move to step in.

“Come in, Sashi,” I said softly, trying to put her
at ease.

She hesitated for a moment, then took a tentative
step inside, her movements slow and uncertain.

I led her through the house and stopped at the
room I had prepared for her. “This is your
room,” I said gently, opening the door.

She glanced around but didn’t say anything. Her
silence wasn’t new, but standing there, I could
feel the weight of it.

“Have you eaten anything?” I asked.

She didn’t respond, just shook her head faintly.

“Okay,” I said after a pause, trying to sound
cheerful. “Settle down and unpack your things.
I’ll bring you something to eat.”

I left her to get comfortable and went out to grab
some food. When I returned, I found her asleep
on the bed. Her tiny frame was curled up, her
backpack lying open on the floor beside her. In
her hand, she held a small photograph—her and
her parents, smiling and happy.

I set the food on the desk, careful not to wake
her. For a moment, I just stood there, watching
her sleep, wondering what must be going on in
her little mind. Then, quietly, I stepped out,
leaving her to rest.

The next morning, my alarm dragged me out of
bed. As I made my way to the living room, I saw

Sashi already awake. She was sitting by the front
door, her knees pulled to her chest, watching the
neighborhood kids playing soccer outside.

The ball rolled into the entrance, and one of the
boys jogged over, calling out, “Hey! Can you
pass it?”

Sashi hesitated, her small fingers gripping the
edge of her shorts. Then, gathering some
courage, she stood up, ran to the ball, and
kicked it back to him.

“Nice kick!” the boy said, smiling. “What’s your
name? Do you want to play with us?”

Sashi didn’t answer. She quickly turned and
walked back inside, brushing past me as though
I wasn’t there.

“You can go play if you want,” I said gently. “It’s
okay.”

She gave me a quick glance but didn’t respond,
retreating to her room instead. I sighed but
decided to let it go.

I made her breakfast and brought it to her room.
She was sitting at her desk, writing in a journal,
her head bent in quiet focus. I placed the plate
on the table.

“Eat something, okay? I’ll be back by evening,”
I said. “If you need anything, there’s food in the
fridge, and you can watch TV if you like.”

She nodded slightly, her attention still on the
journal. I left for work, feeling a strange tug of
worry for her.

At the office, my mind kept drifting back to
Sashi. I remembered how much she seemed to
love her Harry Potter book, so on my way home,
I stopped by a store and bought the first four
Harry Potter movie DVDs, hoping it might cheer
her up.

When I got home, the house was quiet. Sashi was
asleep on the couch, curled up under a blanket.
The TV remote rested on the floor near her, and
her face looked peaceful but tired.

I checked the kitchen and saw she had eaten
something, though not much. Her room,
however, was spotless—everything perfectly
arranged. I couldn’t help but smile at the
difference between her space and my own
messy room.

I gently woke her up for dinner, and after she
washed up, I served her a plate. “I got you
something,” I said, holding up the DVDs.
“They’re the Harry Potter movies. I thought you
might like them.”

Her eyes lit up for a fleeting moment, a spark of
joy breaking through her reserved demeanor. It
was the first time I had seen her genuinely
excited, and it made my chest tighten.

She didn’t say anything, just nodded and ate her
dinner neatly. When she was done, she quietly

picked up her plate, washed it in the sink, and
went back to her room, closing the door softly
behind her.

The next morning, I woke up to find Sashi
already awake, dressed, and sitting quietly in
her room. She seemed far more put-together
than I ever was in the mornings. I handed her a
plate of breakfast.

“Don’t forget,” I said gently. “If you want to play
with the kids outside, you can. Just be careful.”

She gave me a small nod but didn’t look up from
the journal she was writing in. I left for work,
hoping she might start to feel more comfortable.

When I came home that evening, the house was
dimly lit, the TV softly playing one of the Harry
Potter movies. Sashi was asleep on the couch
again, the glow of the screen reflecting on her
small face.

I noticed her journal lying nearby and, curious,
picked it up. On the first page, I found her name,
age, and birthdate—August 25—alongside a
photograph of her with her parents, their arms
wrapped lovingly around her. As I skimmed
through a few pages, I found entries written with
a maturity far beyond her years. Her words
spoke of pain, confusion, and memories of her
parents. My eyes welled up with tears as I
realized just how much this little girl had
endured.

I set the journal down and knelt beside her,
brushing her hair gently from her face. That’s
when I noticed faint scars near her neck and ear.
My heart ached for her in a way I couldn’t put
into words.

She stirred at my touch, her eyes fluttering open.
When she saw me holding her journal, her
expression changed instantly.

“Give that back!” she shouted, her voice
trembling with anger and betrayal.

“I’m sorry,” I said softly, but she snatched the
journal from my hands and ran to her room,
slamming the door behind her.

I stood there, frozen. It was the first time I had
heard her speak, and the hurt in her voice was
unmistakable. I hadn’t meant to intrude, but I
realized too late how much that journal meant to
her.

I stayed outside her door for a moment, unsure
of what to say, before walking away quietly. For
the first time, I truly understood how fragile her
world was—and how much care it would take to
help her rebuild it.

The next morning began as usual. I left breakfast
for Sashi on the table, and instead of telling her
about the school visit planned for the next day, I
wrote a note on a post-it and stuck it to the
fridge:

""We’ll visit your new school tomorrow morning
to get you enrolled.""

By evening, I came home, made dinner for us,
and we sat through another quiet meal.
Afterward, as always, Sashi washed her plate,
took it to the kitchen, and retreated to her room.

Before going to bed, I glanced at the fridge and
noticed another note stuck beside mine. In
small, neat handwriting, it read:

""Okay for the school admission.""

I smiled, feeling a warmth I hadn’t felt in days.

The next morning, Sashi was already awake and
dressed, as was becoming her habit. I called the
office to let them know I’d be late, then we
headed to the school.

We arrived early, and she was taken into a
classroom for an entrance test. Sashi quietly but
confidently completed it, turning in her paper far
earlier than expected.

“What’s your name?” the examiner asked.

“Sashi,” she said, her voice soft but steady.

“And how old are you?”

“Eight.”

The examiner smiled and handed me the
admission form. As I filled it out, she explained
the school’s fee structure. My chest tightened
when I saw the numbers—it was more expensive
than I’d anticipated. How could I possibly afford

this? Without a word, I took the fee pamphlet and
headed toward the door.

“Your kid is really smart,” the examiner said as I
turned to leave. “She’ll be an asset to our school.
It’s rare for someone to do so well on our
entrance test. We pride ourselves on admitting
exceptional students, and she definitely fits that
description.”

I thanked her and left, though her words were a
bittersweet comfort. Sashi deserved the best, but
I couldn’t stop thinking about how I’d manage
the cost.

As we walked to the car, I spotted a neighbor
and his son approaching the school.

“You’re our neighbor, right?” I asked.

“Yes, Uncle,” the boy said cheerfully. “I’m
Nayansh.”

After a short conversation with him and his
mother, we learned that Sashi and Nayansh
would be in the same class. They were there to
pick up his books since school was starting in a
week.

Before leaving, Nayansh offered Sashi a
chocolate. She hesitated, glancing at me.

“You can take it,” I said gently.

She finally accepted it, and I saw a faint smile tug
at the corners of her lips.

Back home, I dropped Sashi off and told her I’d
be back soon. Without giving it too much
thought, I dressed and headed to the hospital for
the job interview that Dvithi had set up.

I’d avoided using my medical degree for so
long, but now, it didn’t matter. If this job could
cover Sashi’s fees, I’d do whatever it took.

The waiting time for the interview dragged on,
and when I finally sat in front of the panel, I felt
out of place. The questions felt rushed, and I left
thinking it hadn’t gone well. Still, I held on to a
sliver of hope.

Two days later, I returned home from my current
job and received a call. The voice on the other
end said, “Congratulations! You’ve been
selected for the position.”

I froze for a moment before relief and joy
washed over me. Tears welled up in my eyes as I
thanked them and ended the call.

Finally, Sashi’s first day of school arrived. She
was already dressed and ready, her school
uniform neat and her backpack securely
strapped on. I drove her to school, glancing at
her in the rearview mirror.

“You’ll be a great student,” I said with a smile.
She didn’t respond, but I caught her looking out
the window, lost in thought.

At the school, Nayansh’s father was also
dropping him off. We exchanged pleasantries as
Sashi and Nayansh walked into the building. I
noticed Sashi didn’t look back as she entered,
and a pang of both pride and sadness hit me.

“I told the school she’ll take the bus home,” I
reminded her before she went in.

That first day turned into a routine. Every
morning, I dropped her off at school despite the
bus being an option—it felt important to share
those few quiet moments with her before the day
began. She came home on the bus, and by the
end of July, it was all second nature.

Though the days were still marked by silence,
the quiet moments had begun to feel less heavy.
In those routines, Sashi and I were finding a
rhythm—one small step at a time.

AUGUST 2006

The day was August 25th—Sashi's birthday. I’d
been thinking about how to make it special, even
though things had been far from easy between
us. I decided to keep it simple. I picked up a
birthday cake, some chocolates, and the next
editions of the Harry Potter books on my way
home. Deep down, I hoped they might make her
smile, even just a little.

Before heading home, I called Kunal. Without
explaining much, I said, “Can you come over?
Bring a gift for an 8-year-old girl.” He paused,
probably confused, but simply said, “I’ll be
there.”

When I finally got home, it was late, and the
house was quiet. The lights were off. I went
straight to Sashi’s room. Without looking at her, I
placed the books and chocolates on her bed and
tried to sound cheerful. “Sashi, look! New Harry
Potter books and chocolates! Come to the living
room—we’ve got to celebrate your birthday!”

But as I turned to her, I saw tears streaming
down her face. She was curled up, holding
herself tightly as though the world around her
was crumbling. I stepped closer, trying to
comfort her, but she pulled away.

“Stop it!” she yelled, her voice trembling with
pain. “You’re not my father, so don’t act like
one!”

Her words hit me like a physical blow. Before I
could say anything, she grabbed the books and
chocolates and threw them across the room.
Tears poured down her face as she screamed,
“Just stop pretending!” She slammed the door,
leaving me standing there, stunned and
helpless.

At that moment, Kunal arrived. He saw
everything. He placed the gift he’d brought
quietly on the table and followed me outside as I
stumbled out of the house, fighting back tears.

“Kunal, take me to the bar,” I said, my voice
hollow.

He didn’t argue, just drove in silence. At the bar,
I drank far more than I should have, drowning in
self-loathing and heartbreak. Kunal sat there,
watching over me like he always did.

When we got back home, I collapsed onto the
living room floor. Kunal sat beside me, waiting
for me to speak.

After a long silence, I broke down completely.
“You saw how she looked at me, Kunal. She
hates me. And I don’t blame her. Who am I to
her? I’m not her father. I can never be him.”

Kunal placed a hand on my shoulder. “Who is
she? What’s her story?” he asked softly.

Through my tears, I started to explain. “Sashi is
my brother’s daughter,” I began, my voice
breaking. “When I was her age, my mother
passed away. My father was a renowned doctor,
but he was cold and distant, especially toward
me. I was the ‘failure’ in his eyes—never good

enough, never smart enough. My brother,
though... he was everything my father wanted.
Despite that, my brother was always kind to me.
He protected me, loved me in ways my father
never did.”

I paused, the memories overwhelming me. “I
worked hard to get my medical degree—not
because I wanted to, but to prove to my father
that I could. But after I graduated, I left. I didn’t
want anything to do with that life anymore.

“Years later, my brother found me. He told me
our father had passed away. I didn’t feel
anything—not sadness, not grief. Just emptiness.
My brother convinced me to come to the funeral,
and that’s when I met Sashi for the first time. She
was so little, so full of life. She had this way of
making everyone around her smile.”

I took a shaky breath. “But then everything fell
apart. After Dvithi left, I was at rock bottom. I
was ready to end everything, Kunal. I felt like I
had nothing left to live for. And then I got the

call—my brother and his wife had died in a car
accident. Sashi was the only survivor.”

Kunal’s expression softened as he listened.

“Her grandparents, my brother’s in-laws, took
her in, but they never wanted her. They blamed
her for everything. They hit her, cursed her,
made her feel like she was a burden. When they
reached out to me, it wasn’t out of love—it was to
get rid of her.

“When I picked her up at the airport, I saw this
quiet, broken little girl who had lost everything.
I couldn’t bear it, Kunal. She’s the only family I
have left. I may not be her father, but I can’t let
her feel like an orphan. Not like I did.

“You know, she writes in a journal. She pours her
heart into it. When I read it... I cried, Kunal.
She’s so smart, so full of thoughts and feelings.
And yet, she’s been through so much pain. How
could anyone hurt someone like her?”

My voice cracked as I continued, “I don’t know if
I’m enough for her. I don’t know if I can give her
the life she deserves. But I have to try. She
deserves to feel safe, to feel loved.”

Tears streamed down my face as I finally broke
down. “I just want her to know she’s not alone.”

Kunal stayed silent for a moment before placing
a firm hand on my shoulder. “You’re doing more
for her than you realize,” he said softly. “She
may not see it now, but one day, she’ll
understand. Just keep showing up for her. That’s
what matters.”

Eventually, exhaustion overtook me. I fell asleep
on the couch, tears still wet on my face. Before
leaving, Kunal covered me with a blanket and
whispered, “Take care of yourself—and her.”

I woke up to the sound of cheerful noises
echoing from outside. Rubbing my eyes, I
realized the house was unusually quiet but
spotless. The books and chocolates Sashi had
angrily thrown last night were gone, and the
door was slightly ajar. I stepped out and saw
something that made my heart swell—Sashi was
sitting on the front step, sharing the chocolates I
had bought with Nayansh and a few other kids
from the neighborhood.

It was a simple moment, but seeing her take that
step toward connection made me feel like
maybe, just maybe, we were moving in the right
direction. I stood there for a while, watching her
smile faintly as she interacted with the kids.

Later, Nayansh ran up to me, his expression
serious. ""Uncle, yesterday on the school bus,
some kids were bullying Sashi. They called her
names for being a 'nerd' and teased her about
reading all the time. She came home crying.""

Hearing this struck me like a punch to the gut. It
all made sense now—why Sashi had reacted the
way she did on her birthday. Her pain hadn’t just
been about missing her parents; it was about
feeling alone and misunderstood. I thanked
Nayansh for telling me and spent the rest of the
day reflecting on how I could be better for her.

---

A few days later, Nayansh showed up at our
door, beaming with excitement. “It’s my
birthday! Can Sashi come to my party?” he
asked eagerly.

I turned to Sashi, whose expression was a mix of
hesitation and curiosity. “Do you want to go?” I
asked. She looked unsure, so I added, “I can
come with you if you’d like.”

Her lips curled into a small smile, and she
nodded. It was the first time I’d seen her look
forward to something.

At the party, Sashi surprised me. She gradually
warmed up and started playing with the other
kids, her laughter mixing with theirs. I chatted
with Nayansh’s parents, watching her from a
distance, marveling at how far she had come.

By the end of the night, both Sashi and Nayansh
were fast asleep after dinner. For the first time, I
carried Sashi home, her tiny body resting
against me as I got home. She felt so small, so

fragile in my arms, and I was overwhelmed by a
sense of responsibility and love.

When we got home, I laid her gently on her bed
and turned to leave, but then I heard her voice,
soft and hesitant. “Can I sleep in your room?”

I froze for a moment, then smiled. “Of course.”

As I settled her in my room, she surprised me
again by asking, “Can you read to me?” Her
voice was almost a whisper, and I realized this
was her way of reaching out. Without a second
thought, I grabbed one of her Harry Potter books
and began reading. She listened intently, her
eyes growing heavy as the story unfolded.
Before I knew it, she was asleep, and I tucked
her in carefully.

That simple ritual became our nightly tradition.
Every evening, I’d read to her, and she’d giggle
at the funny parts or ask curious questions.
Watching her smile and hearing her laugh—it
felt like the ice between us was finally melting.

One day, Kunal called to check in. “How are
things going with Sashi?” he asked.

“It’s getting better,” I said, unable to hide the
warmth in my voice. “She’s opening up to me.
She’s... happy.”

“That’s great to hear,” Kunal replied. “You
know, the night I stayed over, she brought out a
blanket to cover you while you slept on the
couch. She’s such a thoughtful kid. You’re lucky
to have her.”

His words stayed with me, and I realized just
how special Sashi was.

---

True to his word, Kunal visited us a few days
later, bringing a gift for Sashi—a colorful board
game. She thanked him shyly but genuinely, and

soon, the three of us, along with Nayansh, were
playing together, laughing and enjoying
ourselves.

Watching Sashi interact with Kunal, smiling and
teasing him playfully, I felt a warmth I hadn’t felt
in years. It was a day filled with joy, and as I
watched her laugh without a care in the world, I
knew I’d do everything in my power to keep that
smile on her face.

A year passed like the pages of a cherished
storybook, filled with moments that stitched
Sashi’s and my lives together.

Mornings became lively. Sashi would quietly set
the table while I brewed coffee. One day, she
added a sticky note to my lunchbox: ""Don’t skip
lunch."" It was simple but enough to make my
day.

Sashi played more often with Nayansh and the
other kids. She’d return home with messy hair
and dirt-smudged clothes, laughing as she
recounted their games. Her giggles echoed
through the house, a sound that quickly became
my favorite.

We turned Friday nights into movie nights.
Whether it was Harry Potter or animated films,
Sashi would sit beside me, quoting lines she’d
memorized or nudging me to pay attention to
her favorite parts.

Parent-teacher meetings became a proud
moment. “Sashi is excelling in all her subjects,”
her teacher told me. Sashi looked at me
expectantly, and I gave her a thumbs-up. Her
shy smile melted my heart.

During Diwali, we decorated the house together.
Sashi carefully placed diyas along the staircase,
her eyes lighting up as much as the flames. She
even made rangoli, proudly showing it off to
Nayansh when he visited.

Our nightly reading sessions continued. Sashi
started reading aloud to me sometimes, her
voice animated as she brought characters to life.
It became less about the story and more about
the connection we shared.

Kunal became a regular visitor, and Sashi
warmed up to him quickly. One day, she even
called him ""Uncle Kunal,"" which made him grin
ear to ear.

Sashi picked up sketching, filling pages with
drawings of her favorite characters and places.
She proudly showed me her work, and I framed
her best piece—a drawing of the two of us
reading together.

Each of these moments, though small, felt
monumental. Sashi was no longer the reserved,
quiet girl who hesitated at the door. She was
blooming—a happy, curious child with a spark in
her eyes.

And me? I was learning, one day at a time, how
to be the parent she needed. A year had passed,
but it felt like we’d finally found our rhythm—a
life where happiness, healing, and love were at
the heart of it all.

July 2007

The release of the new Harry Potter movie was
all Sashi could talk about. She bounced around
the house, brimming with excitement. “Let’s call
Kunal uncle! He’d love to watch it with us!” she
said, her eyes wide with hope. I smiled and told
her I’d ask him.

The day finally arrived. Sashi was dressed in her
best outfit, holding the Harry Potter book she
was re-reading for the umpteenth time.
Unfortunately, Kunal couldn’t join us—his duty as
a cop kept him busy. Sashi was a little
disappointed, but her enthusiasm quickly
returned as we made our way to the theater.

Watching her experience the magic of Harry
Potter on the big screen was a joy in itself. She
gasped, laughed, and clutched my arm during
the intense parts. By the time the movie ended,
she was already chattering about her favorite
scenes, her face glowing with happiness.

As we left the multiplex, walking through the
attached mall, Sashi’s attention was drawn to a
store display. While she ran ahead to explore, I
froze—there, a few feet away, was Dvithi.

She looked at me, surprised. I gave her a small,
genuine smile and nodded. She smiled back, but
no words were exchanged. Instead, I turned to
follow Sashi, who was now excitedly pointing at
something.

That evening, just as I was settling in, my phone
rang. It was Dvithi.

“How have you been?” she asked, her voice
warm but tinged with curiosity.

We had a long conversation—something we
hadn’t done in a while. I told her about Sashi,
how she came into my life, and how much it had
changed me. I thanked her for setting me up
with the hospital job, explaining how it was
helping me build a stable life for Sashi.

“She’s lucky to have you,” Dvithi said softly.
“Can I meet her?”

I hesitated for a moment, then agreed. “You can
come tomorrow if you’re free.”

The next day, Dvithi visited. Sashi was her usual
shy self at first but warmed up quickly as Dvithi
asked her about school, books, and, of course,
Harry Potter. Watching them interact, I felt a
strange sense of closure and gratitude.

Before leaving, Dvithi shared that she was
moving abroad for a job and planning to settle
there. “I’m happy to see you like this,” she said
with a smile. “You’re doing great, and Sashi...
she’s incredible.”

We wished each other well, and as she left, I felt
a bittersweet sense of finality. Life had taken us
on different paths, but for the first time, I was
truly content with where mine had led.

25 August 2007

It was Sashi’s birthday, and I had planned so
much for the day—a visit to the amusement park,
dinner, and a small celebration at home. But
work had gotten in the way. I promised her I’d
meet her at the amusement park as soon as my
shift at the hospital was over. To make sure she
didn’t miss out, I asked Nayansh’s parents to
take her and assured them I’d join them later.

I even called Kunal, hoping he could join us for
dinner. But duty called—he told me there was a
red alert in the city due to some suspicious
activity, and he had to stay on high alert. “Be
careful,” I told him, a nagging worry creeping
into my chest.

The day flew by, and as the clock neared 8 PM, I
finally wrapped up my work at the hospital. Just
as I was stepping out, chaos erupted.
Ambulances began flooding in, sirens wailing,
and paramedics shouting for stretchers. My
instincts kicked in, and I rushed to help.

The hospital was overwhelmed. People with
severe injuries were being carried in—some
conscious, many not. Among the crowd were
children, bloodied and crying. I picked up a
little boy and brought him inside, my heart
heavy.

That’s when I spotted him—Nayansh. He stood
near the entrance, tears streaming down his
face, clutching a bleeding arm. I froze.
“Nayansh? What are you doing here? What
happened? Where are your parents? Where is
Sashi?”

He didn’t respond, just sobbed harder. My eyes
darted around frantically until I spotted
Nayansh’s parents nearby. They were pale, their
faces a mask of grief. I ran to them. “Where is
Sashi?” I demanded, my voice breaking. They
couldn’t meet my gaze.

It was then I realized—I had been carrying her
the entire time.

I looked down at my arms, and the world
seemed to stop. Sashi, my Sashi, lay there
lifeless. Her small body was covered in dust and
blood, her face eerily peaceful. My mind refused
to process what I was seeing.

“No... no, no, no!” I screamed, clutching her
tighter as I ran toward the ICU. “She’s just hurt!
She’s just asleep!” I shouted at the doctors and
nurses, begging them to help.

They took her from my arms and rushed her
inside. I tried to follow, but they stopped me.
“You need to wait outside,” someone said firmly,
shutting the doors to the ICU.

I stood there, frozen, staring at the doors. My
hands trembled as I wiped Sashi’s blood off my
scrubs. My ears rang as the world around me
blurred into chaos. I turned to the waiting area
and saw a television broadcasting breaking
news

I buried my face in my hands, helpless, as the
world around me crumbled.

The doctor emerged from the ICU, his
expression grave. As he approached, I stood
clutching Sashi's backpack tightly to my chest,
unable to muster the courage to ask what I
already feared.

Inside the backpack, an envelope caught my
eye, its edges peeking out as if waiting to be
discovered. I pulled it out with trembling hands.
Written on it, in Sashi’s neat handwriting, were
the words ""To Dad.""

I opened it, my heart heavy, and began to read:

""Dear Dad,
Thank you for coming into my life. You are the
best thing that has ever happened to me. You
make me feel safe and loved, and I know I can
always count on you. You’re my hero, and I love
you so much. I hope one day I can make you as

proud as you’ve made me feel every single day.
Love, Sashi.""

Tears streamed down my face as I clutched the
letter to my heart, her words piercing through
the pain like a bittersweet melody. My knees
buckled under the weight of grief, and I sat
down, sobbing quietly.

Moments later, the doctor’s voice broke through
the fog. “I’m sorry,” he said softly, and the world
seemed to stop. My ears went silent, and
everything around me blurred. All I could see in
my mind was Sashi’s radiant smile, her laughter
echoing like a distant memory.

Why hasn’t AI caught up in task managers yet?

I’m using Mem.ai and their smart search is next-level. You can be vague, fuzzy, typo-prone, or even associative—“remind me of that thing I mentioned about launch plans and coffee”—and boom, it finds the right note or task like it read your mind.

Why can’t more productivity apps do this?

Todoist, Things, TickTick, even Notion... still stuck in “type exactly what you named it” mode. Imagine if Todoist had this—suddenly it’s 2x more effective. You stop wasting time scrolling, filtering, guessing what you named something. You just ask like a human and get what you need.

We're past the point of smart task apps being dumb when it comes to recall. Let AI actually assist—contextual, fuzzy, associative search should be the bare minimum by now.

Last week we were talking over text, and she sent me a screenshot of her battery settings (we use android) but she cropped the screenshot, i asked her why she cropped the screenshot she said its nothing, so i asked her can i see the full screenshot so after hesitation she sent the full screenshot, and what she cropped out was chrome, she used chrome for about 20 to 30 min.

Back story if she sees something or wants to see something on my phone that concerns her i show her if she asks and vice versa.

So i asked her what she did on Chrome that long she said nothing, so i reply with if you watched p*rn you can tell me. She got defenceve and told me how can i think that low of her, so she said she'll send me a screenshot. By now we are on a video call. So while video calling she goes to chrome history and takes about 3 min and then tells me you know what i wont send a screenshot I'll screenshare, so then theres nothing concerning, so i asked her why she told me moments before that shes not ready to talk to me about it and told me its her privacy and has nothing to do with me, even tho before we did it if there was suspicion.

Then she started telling me horrible stuff like, im weak, im not a man, she's better off without me, she wishes she never gave her virginity to me she doesn't need my money anymore and a bunch of other stuff.

I was calm the whole situation and then left the chat and went to bed as this happened at night.

The next morning she texts me and asks me to come over, I opened the text replied with ""no"" then she calls i answer with ""what do you want"" she says ""morning babe, how did you sleep, babe can you please cone visit""

So it ended up i went to visit got there we didn't talk only said a couple of words she asked me if im hungry i said yes but I'll buy something on my way back home, so she made me something to eat we didn't talk an hour after i ate i got up told her i think i need to go, so i left. The only stuff that was spoken there was me telling her what she told me really hurt.

The next day she texts again saying her aunt and her is going to fam, its family I haven't met yet and they would really like to meet me, i told her no thanks i dont wanna go with y'all. 

The next day same thing she asked me again to go with because the family want to meet me, so i told her, how am i supposed to go with you be happy and laugh around them after what you told me. 

She said okay its fine the relationship is anyways falling apart theres no need for you to meet them. 

That sunday again she told me she was going but she didn't  invite me instead she said if you want to come you welcome, so i said i dont know I'll see. She didn't mention they were in a rush so 2pm shes still st home getting ready so i spam call her 4 times she answers the last time and tells me what, what do you want im busy cant you see, so i tell her listen i just wanted to ask if there was still time from me to come through and we go together she said nothing and i ended the call and didn't text that whole night.

This one night her and my family went to the mall that night, and she bought all of us coffee, so the first time her card declines, so i take out my phone to pay and she insists she is going to pay, she payed and after told me im going to give her money back. It ended up i gave every single cent back she payed to buy us all coffee. I payed it back after a week, but every day she reminded me to pay, so i asked her out of this money i owe you after you willingly bought coffee for my family can i take out all my money i spent on you and your family, when they needed something from the shops and i was going to the shops i buy it, even tho they said when i come by to drop the stuff they'll give me the money, can i also take out all the money i used to buy you data when you needed it. And then she was quite

Throughout all this i removed her from my profile i told her no more of THAT business no touching me no kissing me nothing, i call her by her name. I also rarely talk to her not even on lunch breaks at work, even though she apologizes and says shes so sorry, she still finds words to insult me with after apologizing

1lhrduh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1lhrduh/the_most_recent_visit_with_my_mom_was_most_likely/,The most recent visit with my mom was most likely my last,"My relationship with my mother has always been complicated. She stood by my entire childhood and laughed along with my family while they cracked jokes at my expense until I ran away crying. She did nothing except defend them saying ""it's just a joke, you need to lighten up"". I spent YEARS hating myself because of her. She chose drugs over her own kids, abandoned us for her affair partner, and frequently let our utilities get turned off because she spent her money elsewhere. Despite all of this, I still loved her. For some weird reason, I still do. But before this week, I haven't seen her since Christmas. 

I spent the drive from work to her house both anxious and excited. We were going to get coffee while I filled out some legal paperwork and catch up. The woman has not changed. She spent the entire visit complaining about why I left home, how I never visit her, how my boyfriend is no good for me and how she is dissatisfied with the choices we have made. She thinks he's controlling me from seeing her but she fails to realize it was my upbringing that caused me to resent her. This entire visit solidified what I already knew. I no longer want anything to do with her. If it weren't for my necessity to get this shit done, I wouldn't have seen her.

I spent the car ride home bawling. Not once did she say she misses me, but instead told me that it's ridiculous I don't make time for her. Everything was so backhanded. So I think this was it. I don't think I'm going to visit her ever again.

I am looking for a good, 2L or more cold brew maker, preferably under the almost €90+ prices I am seeing online, but so far I haven't had luck at any of the last coffee stores and fancy appliance stores. Even if it's an online suggestion, if it's not Amazon, I'll be happier (I hate that company.)

Like many of you, I was skeptical about single-purpose kitchen gadgets cluttering my countertop. But after ruining one too many pots of rice (and nearly ruining a good pot), I caved and bought the Toshiba TRCS01 Rice Cooker. Fast forward one month, and I'm kicking myself for not getting one sooner. This thing has completely changed my weeknight meal game!

## The Look and Feel

The Toshiba doesn't scream ""bulky appliance"" like I feared. It sports a modern black and stainless steel finish that looks surprisingly sleek on my counter. It takes up about the same footprint as a coffee maker, with an intuitive control panel that I figured out without even opening the manual. The non-stick inner pot has become my favorite feature - cleanup is genuinely effortless.

## Magical ""Fuzzy Logic"" (It's Actually Real)

This is where this cooker truly shines. The fuzzy logic technology (which sounds made up but is legitimate) actually thinks about how to cook your rice. I've experimented with white, brown, and wild rice blends - all come out with perfect texture and separate grains. No more burnt bottoms or mushy rice!

But it's not just for rice. I've been using:
* The porridge setting for morning oatmeal (game-changer)
* The steam function for vegetables while rice cooks below
* The quick rice option for those ""I forgot to start dinner"" moments
* The keep-warm function that maintains perfect temperature for hours

## The Specs at a Glance

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Capacity | 6 cups uncooked (12 cups cooked) |
| Cooking Functions | White/Brown/Mixed Rice, Oatmeal, Porridge, Quick Rice, Steam |
| Technology | Fuzzy Logic with 3D cooking |
| Keep Warm | Up to 24 hours |
| Delay Timer | Yes, up to 24 hours |
| Accessories | Steaming basket, measuring cup, rice spatula |
| Dimensions | 10.6 × 13.9 × 8.4 inches |

## The Good Stuff

* Consistently perfect rice with minimal effort
* Versatile cooking options beyond just rice
* Keep-warm function that doesn't dry out food
* Genuinely easy-to-clean non-stick pot
* Quiet operation
* Retractable cord (small but appreciated)

## The Not-So-Good Stuff

* 6-cup capacity might be limiting for larger families
* Still takes up counter space (though less than feared)
* Steam release can be surprisingly forceful
* Could use presets for other grains like quinoa
* Loud finish beep that can't be adjusted

## What Other Rice Lovers Are Saying

The Toshiba maintains a solid 4.5-star rating from over 8,000 Amazon reviews. One reviewer said, ""This is the best rice cooker I've ever owned. The fuzzy logic actually works—my rice comes out perfect every time.""

Another pointed out: ""The steam function with the included basket is fantastic. I can make a complete meal with rice below and veggies or fish steaming above. One appliance, one complete meal, minimal cleanup.""

Some users did mention the non-stick coating showing wear after a year of heavy use. I'll keep an eye on mine, but so far it's holding up perfectly.

## Should You Buy It?

**For beginners:** Perfect if you're new to rice cookers. Intuitive interface, foolproof results.

**For intermediate users:** You'll appreciate the versatility for different grains and the steaming function.

**For advanced users:** While not the highest-end option, the fuzzy logic technology delivers professional results that would satisfy even discerning rice enthusiasts.

I never thought I'd be someone who gets excited about a rice cooker, but here we are. If you eat rice regularly or want to simplify meal prep without sacrificing quality, this Toshiba model is absolutely worth the counter space.

# Learn How to Overcome the Odds with Our Proven, Unique Approach

Our approach at [Crew Crosscheck](https://crewcrosscheck.com) is like no other.

[Crew Crosscheck — The Cabin Crew Interview Finishing School](https://preview.redd.it/ikxfqgj41i8f1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=f18848907b792b85e90d4240172591301ce89058)

Let’s not kid ourselves.

Nineteen failures isn’t exactly a badge of honour. It’s a number that makes people exchange uncomfortable glances. Which is why it has been my dirty little secret for twenty years.

I wasn’t one of those perfect applicants whose lapel was earmarked for a clipped wing.

So why listen to me?

Because I clawed my way off the Slag Heap and into the elite ranks of Emirates, one mascara-streaked rejection at a time — and I documented how to do it.

And, besides, if that notorious 99% rejection rate holds even a whisper of truth — we’ll unpack the truth behind that statistic later — then most of us are doomed from the start.

# FUNDAMENTALS

# Know the Process Before You Walk Into It

Through *Caitlyn’s Log*, step into eight of my most memorable interview rooms with me, and experience, in simulated real time, how I went from a serial reject to “congratulations and welcome aboard” at Emirates.

* First we’ll try out with **Virgin Atlantic**, where my naïve optimism got its first wakeup call.
* After we’re given the collective cold shoulder and directed towards the rejection door, we’ll take a detour to the local brewery, where we’ll rub shoulder-pads with the Old Wives and soak up their airline recruitment “wisdom”.
* Then we’ll circle back to **Virgin Atlantic** for a second attempt, only to discover everything is suddenly different.
* And then we’ll follow the Old Wives’ advice and see what happens when we take their wisdom on a whirlwind tour of **British Airways**, **easyJet**, and a quick jaunt to Switzerland for **CrossAir**. Buckle up — oh, but don’t touch that strap.
* We’ll soak up the lessons from each, until we arrive at the **Emirates** Open Day that changed everything, and where you witness the moment that triggered my ah-ha moment.
* Then we’ll reverse-engineer the entire process.
* From there, it’s the **Emirates** invite-only group interview, followed by a sharp lesson in how fast they forget you when I’m turned away at my **Emirates** final interview. But I get another shot. One more **Emirates** final interview, and this time there’s a Golden Call and we go through to **Emirates** onboarding.
* Finally, we’ll jet out to **Emirates** Aviation College in Dubai, where the myths unravel and all those unusual interview tasks suddenly make sense.

Through these particular experiences, you’ll see:

\- How recruitment approaches vary between premium and budget airlines.  
\- Cultural differences between international and regional carriers.  
\- The contrasting hiring styles of flag carriers and private airlines.  
\- How interview formats can differ, even within the same airline.  
\- What to expect from open days compared to invitation-only sessions.  
\- And exactly what it takes to succeed, or fail, at each stage.

**Surprise Layovers**

Since we’re taking the scenic route, expect some surprise layovers.

One layover finds us in a Greek \_taverna\_. There, covered in splintered plates, adorned by a tower of flaming glasses, and festooned in bank notes, you’ll meet Bambas. What he taught me about \_Thinking Greek\_, may be the most effective interview strategy I’ve ever stumbled across.

In another, we’ll revisit a Virgin Atlantic ghost flight so mesmerising, it ought to have lit up every recruiter’s face. But Old Wives warned me: \_Don’t mention travel, it sounds superficial\_, so I held it back. Using my examples, you’ll learn to reframe even your cringiest stories, so they speak for you, not against you.

[Crew Crosscheck — Route Map](https://preview.redd.it/i37ebp871i8f1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=bee725afca10c6462220623fd37835bb8989c368)

# Make Sense of Interview Chaos

**Learn how to unpack experiences with Post-Interview Debriefs.**

After each scene, we’ll scooch forward to the present day where I will draw upon my 25 years of research and experience to cut through the noise and help you make sense of the chaos.

We’ll comb through the pivotal moments: from misread signals to misaligned thinking to missed opportunities.

And, I don’t just focus on my past self, because that would be crushingly dull. I’ll zoom in on other applicants and the Old Wives, as well.

We’ll unpack what’s being said versus what’s implied— including hidden meanings, unspoken expectations, and subtle cues.

Then I’ll translate what’s expected, exactly what Recruiters are looking for and why the tasks exist— contrary to eyebrow-raising confusion, it’s not a secret audition.

>You’ll come away not only understanding the process but also embodying the habits that Recruiters don’t overlook. The ones that settle in your posture, your actions, and responses. The kind that whisper, “Crew material”.

# Crosschecking is Not Just for Doors

**Flex your critical thinking with Crew Crosschecks.**

In this course, you don’t sit blinking like it’s story-time. You’re here to: Dissect. Decode. Crosscheck.

Crosschecking is not just for doors. It is one of the most valuable skills you can learn, not only in the role, but throughout the recruitment process.

We use crosschecking to transform you from a passive reader into an active participant so that instead of soaking up my story and hoping answers magically appear, **you’ll inhabit multiple perspectives: including Cabin Crew and Recruiter**.

The benefit of a simulated interview is we get to hit pause at key moments, rewind, and dissect. Not only “what did they say?” But “what did that show me?” That’s crosschecking.

And that little flicker of analysis? That’s your Recruiter mind kicking in.

Through these multiple viewpoints, **you stop guessing what recruiters really want and start understanding what makes you stand out**. Your awareness sharpens. And once you’ve done it enough? That mindset? It’s yours to keep.

When it’s your interview, you won’t be guessing.

Welcome to your upgrade.

>When you step into your interview, you’ll pick up on Recruiter cues, read the room, understand the tasks, and adjust in real time because you get something far better than cheatsheets and shortcuts — you get experience.

# PHILOSOPHIES

# Our Pillars for Success

* Stop Thinking Like an Applicant
* Align with Their Airline
* Think Like an Airline Recruiter
* Behave Like Cabin Crew
* Treat the Process as a Simulated Flight

# There is No Universal “Perfect Applicant”

**Tailor your approach by thinking like your ideal airline.**

“I don’t know what they want” is the one of the most common frustrations I hear. The real answer comes from thinking like an airline. But not just any airline — *their* airline.

Whilst Cabin Crew responsibilities are universal, airline personalities are anything but. Each one is chasing its *own* version of “perfect.” Their unique culture shapes not only how Recruiters assess you, but how the entire interview unfolds.

Emirates doesn’t recruit like Virgin. BA doesn’t recruit like Qatar.

That’s why some carriers focus almost entirely on group discussions, whilst others weave singing and dancing into theirs. The tasks are never random — they’re intentional, and they tell you everything about who they’re looking for.

Once you figure out that vibe, you can tailor your entire strategy — from how you dress, to your photos, to the stories you tell.

One size does not fit all. And when you stop trying to tailor yourself to fit an impossible, universal ideal, you find the airline that fits you.

**With the precision of a uniform fitting, we teach you to tailor your approach without compromising your authenticity.**

# You Cannot Sneak Past Professional People Watchers

**Understand what Recruiters want to see by practicing Thinking Like a Recruiter.**

Cabin Crew Recruiters are not desk-bound HR personnel who will never see you again.

**They are Senior Flight Attendants, Pursers, Former Crew, and Cabin Crew Trainers,** who have a selfish, vested interest in who you are and how you behave because they might work directly with you some day.

Pretty good isn’t good enough. Even good enough isn’t good enough. Because they are scouting reliable team members they can trust with safety, security, and someone whose company doesn’t make a short-haul feel like long-haul.

Whilst you’re discussing *the ban on public smoking* or *which of the seven survivors to save from an ocean ditching,* they’re looking past the surface level of the task and seeing you aboard their flight. And, they’re wondering: *Can you be assertive with the entitled businessman, not panic and find the defibrillator, and still be fun for a cup of coffee on the Champs-Élysées?*

You cannot sneak past them because they’ve worked the line — some of them for decades — andthey are trained, professional people watcherswho observe hundreds of individuals every work day. They’re looking for those applicants who exhibit Cabin Crew behaviours.

[Airline Cabin Crew Recruiters Are Professional People-Watchers](https://preview.redd.it/nenlb9uy1i8f1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ed1fae174ef10c13df3a1217ea5165cec8c0987)

# Instinct, Not Polish, Gets You Hired

**Build the habit of Behaving Like Cabin Crew.**

Who you are when no one’s watching is exactly who shows up when you’re sidetracked by activities.

The process is designed to unravel facades, to see the real you behind the polish.

So, after two hours of group activities, your practiced performance deteriorates, and you’re left with just your instincts. If you normally shrink into yourself, that’s what surfaces.

Your instincts are shaped by your habits — so, practice Cabin Crew habits while no one is watching.

As part of the program, you sharpen your Cabin Crew instincts until they become automatic. And when you’re in the interview, those will show up in your presence and your stories — not because you rehearsed them five minutes earlier, but because they are your habits.

>When you build the right habits, passing the interview becomes a byproduct.

# THE REAL YOU

# Don’t just walk in prepared. Walk in experienced.

Your knowledge and behaviours will come together as the journey winds down, so that when you enter the interview room yourself, it’ll feel as if you’ve already lived through it — and, in a way, you have without ever changing out of your unicorn onesie.

[50+ hours of cabin crew interview experience without changing out of your unicorn onesie](https://preview.redd.it/5klbva962i8f1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74934eb6e1ccfcc740260a5069a199815458e88)

# Focus On Structural Integrity, Let The Airline Add Livery

**You can fly a plane without the paint, but you can’t fly the paint without the plane.**

“Dress like you work there.“ That’s the common advice. As if sprinkling something red into your perfectly tailored suit, then engineering your hair with an aerodynamic twist is all it takes to be seen. It isn’t, because everyone’s doing it, and that makes it a uniform. Uniforms are designed to smooth us into sameness — not celebrate individuality.

That’s part of the reason why Emirates have recently added a dress code to its recruitment events. They are leveling the competition and forcing you to find other ways to stand out.

At Crew Crosscheck, we don’t do moulds, and we don’t do costume. You’ll learn how to dress for the culture without disappearing into the carpet.We help you showcase the crew version of *the real you* — even if your current wardrobe leans towards seven-inch heels and school-blazer nostalgia.

How do you stand out when you’re walking into a room of mirrors? Well, that’s easy.Focus first on your structural integrity (aka, your habits and instinct).Airlines will give you their livery when you get the Golden Call.

>When the interview veers off-script — and it will — you won’t panic, you’ll pivot — the way Cabin Crew always do.

# We’ll take the myth of the “perfect applicant”…

**…and watch it buckle under the glare of reality.**

My research is shaped from the sort of experience that doesn’t come from playing it safe. Which is why you’ll read stories here you won’t find anywhere else.

* Like the time I *nearly* drowned at Emirates Aviation College — yep, during ditching training.Couldn’t swim, turned the simulation into an actual rescue operation, yet still graduated with only a minor dent to my pass rate and soggy knickers. You’ll be the first to discover the curious little detail that explains why I graduated anyway.
* The group discussion where my only comment got cut off halfway through by an overzealous applicant, and yet I still advanced — because it turns out it’s not how much you say, it’s about making it count.
* And the personality test that went entirely tit’s up — not in the perky, teeth-gleaming, 50s housewife type of way, but in the British “oh bugger, I’ve misaligned every box” sort of way.

Let’s be clear — these aren’t the low points of my story. These were from my successful journey with Emirates.Even with these — and many more — blunders, I still passed.

Ticking all the boxes isn’t nearly as important as knowing how to recover and which boxes should be ticked in the first place.

# WHAT TO EXPECT

>Engage in exercises that inspire you to think different, tackle discomfort, and rewire habits.

# Communicate in a Moderated Environment

# Work alongside peers and our team in a supportive, structured environment that reflects the collaborative nature of Cabin Crew life.

This isn’t just about solo prep. Together, we’ll talk, try things out, test ideas.

You’ll take part in practical activities, hands-on projects, real-time challenges— the kind that don’t just build skills, but instincts.

Plus, you’ll learn how to give and receive feedback — a core crew skill — while adapting to different personalities and communication styles.

* Share your Accident Report Cards.
* Debrief your interviews.
* Ask the questions that keep you up at night.
* Sync up with peers for extra practice or perspective.
* Share your stories.

# Don’t Sound Like a Cheatsheet

# Learn to improvise authentic and unscripted answers that are unmistakably you.

You can’t rewrite your past — but you can learn how to tell it in a way that makes Recruiters nod, pause, and remember you.

Even if, like me, your cabin crew dream originated with something mildly mortifying. A questionable 1960s poster or flight attendant Barbie, perhaps. Dreams are allowed to have silly beginnings. And you’re allowed to have crooked experiences. What matters is what you do with them now.

Say goodbye to trite answers. No more “I’m a perfectionist.” No more “I just love working with people.” You are not a brochure.

You are a person. We will help you sound like one.

We’ll work through all the core questions, including:

* Why do you want to become Cabin Crew?
* Why do you want to work with this airline?
* Why are you the best person for this job?
* What do you think the role really involves?
* How do you feel about working special occasions?
* When have you gone out of your way for a customer?
* and more…

# Kill Myths, Not Your Dreams

**The pub used to be our only echo chamber. Today it’s in your pocket.**

Myths are seductive.They arrive polished, persuasive, and convincing, ready to bypass your better judgment and wrap themselves around your instincts.

Some are born from honest confusion. Some are fueled by fear. Others are generational hand-me-downs — glamourised in the golden age and immortalised by the Old Wives.

* “Airlines don’t hire introverts.” (*wrong*)
* “Swimming is an international regulatory requirement.” (*wrong*)
* “Dress like you already work there.” (***wrong***)
* “Speak first and speak often. Never hesitate.” (***wrong***)
* “Don’t talk about travel, it’s superficial.” (***wrong***)

In the course, you’ll get truth — crosschecked against policy, anchored by evidence, proven through experience, and threaded into stories.

# Find Flow With Interview Chaos

**Learn to improvise, adapt, and think on your feet, just like the job demands.**

If you’ve ever been to an airline interview, you’ll have witnessed tasks so bizarre, they leave everyone side-eyeing each other, asking “Did I miss something?” And those blasted group discussions that go off the rails faster than an armrest argument in 34B — yikes.

Chaos is not a flaw in the process —chaos *is* the process, meant to expose how you really think and adapt under pressure. Because airlines don’t want to see the curated version of you. They don’t even want to see the best version of you.They want to see *the authentic you* — unscripted, unfiltered, and, ideally, under slight duress.

And throughout all this,Recruiters are scouting teammates. Those who read the room, pivot, hold their nerve, and recover with grace.

You’ll learn how to:

* Handle a group exercise gone rogue — without disappearing or dominating.
* Use silence as a tactic, not a panic point.
* Spot the golden moments while others scramble for spotlight.
* Hold your own in unpredictable role plays.
* Assert yourself without crushing others — or shrinking.
* Professionally listen through reflective listening.
* Get into an already flowing conversation.
* And more.

# Witness The Industry Through Operational Eyes

**Observe strong customer service, the real daily life, and how different departments operate together. Then debrief.**

We’ll host semi-regular watch parties.

Think: *Airline*, *Airport*, *View From the Top*, *Soul Plane* (yes, really), and those oddly fascinating airline safety videos that everyone else ignores, but we secretly love.

But this isn’t popcorn and passivity. We’ll pause, rewind, and dissect.

* How did the staff handle that situation?
* What does that reaction tell us about airline expectations?
* What would you do differently as crew?

It’s a revealing way to study real-world behaviour, sharpen your instincts, and see the industry through operational eyes.

Because understanding how *they* think starts with watching how *they* work.

This is where instinct and preparation meet. We’ll help you sharpen both.

* Practice with a Performance Coach
* Simulated Scenarios

# Welcome to [Crew Crosscheck](HTTPS://CREWCROSSCHECK.COM)

# We don’t cram. We condition.

Crew Crosscheck is NOT a short-term pass-the-interview-program that sends you off with a cheatsheet.

This is twelve weeks of deep immersion so you won’t leave naïve and wide-eyed like I did at 18. Or hollow and over-rehearsed like I was at 21.You’ll be better than the 25 year old version of me that got the job with Emirates.

You’ll build more momentum in 12 weeks than I managed in 7 years— carried by the full weight of my two decades of experience, ongoing research, and lived airline recruitment insight.And layered atop that: twenty years of feedback from Readers and Students who’ve tested, tweaked, and sharpened this into what it is now.

So, if you’re ready, buckle up. And don’t try to hide your unbuckled seatbelt under a blanket. Recruiters will catch that a mile away.

Get coffee / other liquid sustenance. LONG!

First one did great. Was always on charger via DC input (18 / 20v laptop power supply). Then exclusive on 120vac input.  Then both, and was able to limit 120vac to 100w and 18vdc to 72w. No issues encountered with R3, unlike R2 that preferred to cyclical (ea week) discharge itself and ignore all charging.  Load connected was ~50w (both R2 and R3).  R3-230 #1 has now been placed in its final use area, powering 2 loads, via 120vac, around 17w.  Power failure occurred due to line maintenance that became prolonged. When power came back, if happily charged itself and sat there doing nothing. It required a trip to the location, 2 hours ea way, to investigate. Battery fully charged, but 120vac was not on. Pushing button, nvr came back to life and TMobile gateway started up.  Port Memory *IS* turned on, but it didn't. Figured was something related to discharged battery (health remains 100%). I do have limits at 20% & 90%.

2nd one was stress tested at work.  Trying to keep an Igloo branded refrigerator going w/o interruption. This is proving to be harder. If power is interrupted, R3 cannot start fridge right away. It requires for fridge to sit for 15min to allow refrigerant pressures to equalize, reducing start power on compressor (rated 1.5A @ 120vac). I have also used it extensively to power fans, soldering irons (100w), area lights (LED), laptops, comm equipment, etc. All in a shop environment that has reached past 100°F.  So far, it is holding its own.  Haven't figured out how to create an automation / schedule that turns 120vac off for 15min, on for 105min, and repeat.  To clarify, I haven't found a way *reliably* as a schedule appears to run for several iterations, then fails with notice.  Automations are not supported either?!?  Oh, failure might be attributable to network issue at work. Sometimes firewall let's traffic to/from ecoflow without issues, other times it won't. Oh, and sometimes our IT disables guest wifi (no portal) just so they can fuck with us. My opinion.

3rd is current testing.  It has been plugged into 120vac for a week now. Port memory turned on. 120vac and 12vdc enabled.  Charging limited to 100w. Odd behavior? It turns off 120vac output. So far, I have only caught it when charging at 100w, haven't seen it when discharging battery (but still plugged in). It does NOT turn 120vac back on. Currently, there is no load connected to this one, and only charging off 120vac.

4th one... Not evaluated yet.
5th one... Not evaluated yet.

I am so close to placing a 12v 300Ah LFP at remote location and running off of it. 17w from 3840wh battery? 200+ hours without charging. But, nvr there does not like vdc input greater than 13.5, and TMobile gateway requires 15vdc via PD.

The Houston Astros (-1.5, -189) and Los Angeles Angels (+1.5, +196) are set for a pitchers’ duel that’s less “explosion” and more “meh, okay.” Kyle Hendricks (Angels) vs. Ryan Gusto (Astros)? Sounds like a Spotify playlist for a nap.

**Key Stats to Know:**

* The Angels are 7-5 as favorites with odds of -125 or shorter this season.
* The Astros? They’re 13-10 as underdogs, proving they’re the MLB’s answer to that guy who always picks last in drafts but somehow wins.
* Offensively, both teams are about as exciting as a group project: Angels average 4.1 runs/game (22nd), Astros have scored 324 total runs (16th).

**Odds Breakdown:**

* **Moneyline:** Angels (-189) vs. Astros (+196). Bet the farm on the Astros if you *really* need the drama of a 13-10 underdog record.
* **Spread:** Take the Angels (+1.5, -160) for a “safe” play or the Astros (-1.5, +140) if you’re feeling lucky (and into chaos).
* **Total:** **Under 9 runs (-110)** is the way to go. These teams combined for 8.2 runs in their last three meetings—because who needs offense when you’ve got pitching?

**Player Props (What We Know):**

* **Hendricks Over 6.5 Strikeouts (-130):** He’s averaged 6.2 Ks this season. Bet the “over” if you believe in consistency.
* **Gusto Under 3.5 Earned Runs (+115):** His ERA is 4.75. If you’ve got a time machine, bet on him not spilling coffee on the mound.

**Prediction:**  
This game is a statistical tie with a side of “meh.” The Astros will win 4-3 in 10 innings, thanks to a walk-off single by a player whose name starts with “Y” and ends with “why am I watching this?” The Angels’ offense will manage exactly zero extra-base hits, and the total will fall under like a deflated balloon.

**Final Verdict:**  
Take the Astros -1.5 if you’re a glutton for punishment. Otherwise, Under 9 runs and Hendricks Over 6.5 Ks are your best bets. And remember: in baseball, anything can happen… like the Astros pulling off another miracle. *Again.*

In a match that could’ve been titled *“How to Win While Suffering from First-Half Amnesia,”* Molde clawed back from a 2-1 halftime deficit to stun Vålerenga 3-2, thanks to a late header from Fredrik Gulbrandsen—assisted by Magnus Wolff Eikrem, who also scored the equalizer. The victory moved Molde up to 8th in the Eliteserien, while Vålerenga remains stuck in 12th, where they’ve apparently been practicing their sad trombone routine.

The first half was so dire for Molde that assistant coach Magne Hoseth, a former player with a flair for philosophical coaching, declared, *“We must be cynical in football. We must show a bit of ‘fuckings moral.’”* Translation: “Play dirty, but make it art.” His halftime adjustments included replacing Isak Amundsen with Valdemar Lund, presumably because Amundsen was too busy dodging Vålerenga’s Filip Thorvaldsen, whose rough play earned him a metaphorical parking ticket from TV 2 expert Simen Stamsø-Møller: *“That deserves a parking ticket.”*

Vålerenga led 2-1 at halftime, but Molde’s second-half surge was so dramatic it made *Game of Thrones* look like a nap. Eikrem, Molde’s captain, later shrugged off the chaos, saying, *“Matchwinner is the man of the day, I think,”* as if he were just ordering a coffee, not orchestrating a comeback.

For Vålerenga, it’s another day of wondering if their defense is a sieve or just a sieve with a bad attitude. For Molde? They’re now 8th, one step closer to escaping the “also-rans” section of the league.

**Key Stats:**

* Molde: 3 goals (Eikrem, Gulbrandsen), 3-2 final.
* Vålerenga: 2 goals, but only 2 points to show for it.
* Parking tickets awarded: 1 (metaphorical, to Thorvaldsen).
* Cynicism index: Molde 11/10, Vålerenga 2/10 (but hey, someone’s gotta be the moral high ground).

Next up? Let’s hope Sarpsborg and Bryne bring more goals and fewer parking violations.

Special Thanks to Random3x 🐌 (Weirder of Words) for helping me tighten up the prose. 

**\_\_\_\_**

**Story so far:**

While exploring the Meyer residence, the Whales encounter a different type of monster known as “The Avarice”, parasitic bugs that use magic stones to control their hosts. The girls draw a rotating schedule for Zefir. 

\_\_\_

**Meyer House, Lakeview IL, Another Earth:**

“Show time!” Philia said, holding her pistol to her chest. Upon hearing the kitchen door close, she nodded for Gerald, Oliver, and their clones to get into position. With a nod, she quickly turned the knob and kicked it open. As the squad burst in, Peanut led the way by lighting herself up like a glowing fungus, revealing the occupants within. 

“Weapons free.” Philia said quietly as whipped around to her right, letting the little mushroom take care of the foremost Avarice and opened fire on the other one to her side.

“Open wiiiide!” Peanut cried as she met the Avarice’s charge, darting forward to jam her wand into the monster’s maw and causing it to choke. Its head exploded as a glittery chevron shot streaked across the air, through the second Avarice standing behind it and impacted against the opposite wall, rattling the nearby shelves. The first body now-headless collapsed sideways, right into the also recently-headless body the Avarice that Philia shot, the impact causing both bodies to crumble. 

“*Cyka blyat*!” Zefir joked. 

“Git guuuuud.” Philia said as she crushed a weakly moving insect.

 

At the same time, The mice rushed in, ignoring the Avarice that Peanut and Philia killed. 

Gerald’s clone barrelled through the left-side of the door, burying the long blade of his glaive into the Avarice’s gut, pushing it back as it let out a guttural bellow of agony. Still pushing forward, the clone quickly unsummoned then recalled the weapon to his paws, delivering a second powerful thrust to the Avarice’s torso with all the power of a charge at full tilt. The creature was gurgling its last as it scrambled back, trying to keep its footing as it was shoved back twice. Its vision was already getting blurry as it looked up to see a pole-hammer smash right into its head.

Hot on the clone's heels, Mason targeted an additional Avarice lurking further to the left with two precise shots with his shotgun’s under barrel pellet gun. The first pellet struck the creature's body and sent it reeling. The second fractured the gem as the pellet embedded itself, causing spalling shards to burst inside the creature and the parasites inside it. If that didn’t kill it, then the warhammers generated by the Companion Shillelagh charm pulverizing its skull did.

An Avarice that would’ve attacked Gerald’s clone and Mason was taken down by Gerald himself. A blast from his high-powerful rifle obliterated the gem on its chest.

 

Simultaneously, Oliver’s clone bull-rushed his own target, squeaking fiercely as he skewered the Avarice deep in the gut and drove it back. The creature howled in pain as it tried to grip the haft, but its trembling hands sprang back as it gripped only spikes that lined the steel-lined ferrule. Its knees were quickly buckling as the glaive’s long blade flared wide at the base and tore a big hole in its body and the spike at the back of the blade was angled perfectly to pierce its heart. Thick plumes of black smoke billowed out of its body as its viscera quickly petrified and fell, breaking into several dusty pieces as the organs quickly died off.

Meanwhile, as Oliver’s clone drove his opponent back; Usher quickly moved in to intercept another Avarice trying to blindside him. A sharp report of the shadow mouse’s shotgun caused the would-be interloper’s body to erupt in a geyser of black ethereal smoke and brittle clay shards as it died on the spot. The remainder of the pellets hit the bare garage wall, showering another monster slumped against it. It never got to even brush off the debris as Oliver himself quickly stepped in and shot it right in the head.

 

""The garage door's open!"" Philia observed. The wall opposite the squad had come in from and near the garage door had shelves containing various toolboxes and spare tire or two.  Somehow, in the frantic exodus, a hefty tool box ended up wedged under the table, preventing the door from fully shutting. 

""Need help?"" Ingrid asked, peeking in. 

""No..."" Philia replied, gesturing to the mice to cover her. The golden clones quickly crouched down, glaives at the ready to stab anything that tried to slither in. Mason, Usher, Gerald and Oliver did the same, ready to open fire. All that was coming inside the garage were thin wisps of the evening mist. Philia pulled at the toolbox, finally letting the garage door close with a metallic clang.

“Well… no cars.” Philia shrugged as she stood and turned to face Ingrid. “As you can see, no cars.”

“Dammit.” Ingrid grumbled, “No luck…”

“Let’s go team, slowly now.” Philia said as the group got to work checking every nook and cranny to avoid nasty surprises. “We inspect as a unit.”

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow, Terragalia:**

The larkirks cooed in agitation as they saw the Avarice lunge at Peanut, only to crow triumphantly as she blasted it point-blank with her wand. Some were flapping their wings in excitement, bobbing their heads.

“That is some impressive shooting!” Nive exclaimed, his voice muffled as he was in the middle of chewing his Mallorcan-esque pastry. He had never seen the Elion-Nosco princess move like that before. It was one thing to see her hover-skate around and fire away with her bigger guns, but there was something very precise and disciplined with the way she handled her “pistol”. It looked like it was honed from years of practice. There was no way she could have simply learned this from nothing back in Elion-Nosco, giving further credence to her claim that was a, in her own words, a “reincarnator”. 

“*Cyka blyat*!” the ciltran boy exclaimed cryptically. 

“*Git guuuuud*.” came Philia’s equally enigmatic response. 

“She called it the *Mozambique Drill*, if I remember correctly…” Kaolla told Nive, dunking her roll into her coffee; after she had polished off the cream cheese and herbs off the top, “According to her, it ensured a certain kill without needing further confirmation. Two shots to the body, preferably the chest, followed by one attempt at the head. Said it came from an ancient practice of their gun-warriors when entering an enemy’s stronghold.”

Vorque nodded as he finished his roll and washed it down with his coffee before speaking.

“My eyes weren’t deceiving me.” Vorque meowed “That was two shots straight to that Avarice’s gem in its heart and a sure hit to the head… That marksmanship cannot have been cultivated from a few hours’ worth of secret practicing in Elion-Nosco.”

“I agree…” Kaolla concurred.

“There it is…” Nive said, plopping another sweet pastry into his mouth.

“What do you mean?” Vorque purred inquiringly, he paused to drink from his coffee mug and then realized what he was looking at.

“She’s moving exactly like the mice did when they were inspecting the cabinets…” Kaolla said, tearing off another still-hot pastry from the tray and taking a bite. 

\_\_\_

**Meyer House, Lakeview IL, Another Earth:**

“This is some fine work.” Iohann remarked as she peered into the china cabinet’s glass panes, ignoring the sounds of gunfire. 

“They’re reserved for really special occasions.” Ingrid told her. “Thanksgiving for example, one of the few occasions of the year that warrants the whole family coming home.”

“*Cyka blyat!*” Zefir crowed.

“Git Guuuuud” Philia’s voice echoed inside the garage.

“Viel, Iohann, start emptying the cabinets.” Ingrid said “Both those plates and that cabinet would fetch a good price, or look good in Autumnhollow.”

“This is Kitty-Five, Baseplate, Outlaw, prepare for another batch.” Viel said as she summoned the Table Box and its stack of baskets. 

Ingrid quickly walked back to the garage, Peanut was illuminating the garage with her body, several broken and dried up remains of the Avarice lay on the floor in clumps. 

“Need help?” she asked, seeing Philia tug at a big toolbox that had somehow wedged itself under the roll-up garage door.

Philia shook her head “No… and, as you can see, no cars.”

Ingrid sighed.

“Dammit… no luck.”

“It says 8:12 on  this clock Ingrid…” Cecil said, looking at the wall-mounted timepiece, “We’re five hours  ahead, it’s only 3:12.”

“Nothing we can do about that now…” Ingrid replied, coming back to the dining hall,  “We’re already caught right in the middle, whether we go around and look for vehicles or head back to the rift there’s a chance we could bump into anything. We’ll proceed as usual.”

“Gotcha.” Cecil replied, “Oh and I found the way to the basement…”

Leading the way, the slime quickly hovered his portal over to a staircase leading down. 

“After you,” He said, chambering the first round of his M240.

Boldly, Ingrid walked down the wooden steps, noting the family pictures hung on the wall. These ones all involved some form of recreation, such as the man of the house and his son holding up a sizable marlin, a picture of the man golfing, his son playing baseball and football, there were also older pictures of the man in his youth also playing the same sports as well as hunting.

Ingrid snickered “Why do ordinary family photos look so creepy when everything’s dark and abandoned, is that just a thing for us Earth people, or…?”

“*I’ve explored ancient abandoned castles,*” Siria replied, “*Yes, looking at life-like portraits in a place completely devoid of it does unnerve me.*” 

“*Same…*” Sammy added “*...it’s the discord between the vibrance captured in the image compared to the ruins you see now…thinking of what could have caused this…*”

“*Interesting…*” Cecil remarked “*...guess it’s a universal thing then.*”

“*There’s pictures up this staircase…*” Viel chimed in “*...something about them looks so sad now everyone’s gone…*”

“*Shhh…I hear something!*” Selphie said.

“*Get ready…S-sammy!*” Siria protested.

Ingrid’s Argus Aura let out a pulse. 

“*Three inside…very faint.*” she said quietly “*It’s the Avarice.*” 

“*Gotcha.*” The slime replied, the mice took up their battle stations and readied their guns.

Ingrid opened the door, half expecting to see a zombie chewing on the occupants who had barricaded themselves below.

Instead it lunged at her.

\_\_\_

**Autumnhollow, Terragalia:**

From the command center, Gwen jolted in her seat, letting out a cry of surprise as she saw the Avarice lunge right at Ingrid. 

Zefir however, reacted differently.

“Boo! Jumpscare!” Zefir shouted cupping his hands over his mouth in emphasis, as if he was watching some boorish puppet play rather than the real life-and-death situation that Ingrid and Cecil were in.

Gwen watched as Ingrid met its charge head-on, crouching down into a spinning leg sweep that made her recoil. Gwen was certain that if she tried that herself she would end up breaking and dislocating most of the bones in her lower body.

Ingrid spun and swept her leg twice, her foot became a black and gold blur as it brutally smashed one of the Avarice’s shins, then the other, leaving grisly open fractures on the monster’s legs as well as a sickening crunch on impact. Then, impossibly Ingrid sprang up to an electrified uppercut. She moved so fast that the creature was halfway through its fall when her fist caught it in the chin.

“*Doryaa!*” came Ingrid’s warcry.

The combination of deadly voltage and an uppercut that could flip a car over sent the already dead Avarice into an clumsy aerial pirouette, ending in a shower of desiccated clay as it struck the rafters.

“*Toasty!*” Cecil yodelled cryptically. The two other Avarice were taken care of as Brody and Eli plugged them clear between the eyes.

“Triple Kill!” Zefir crowed in a growly, low-pitched voice, raising his fists in triumph.

“*What happened?*” Philia asked.

“*You must beat Sheng Long to stand a chance.*” Ingrid replied in a strange accent, causing the earthlings to laugh.

“Jumpscare, Ingrid and the mice took care of it.” Zefir chuckled. 

“I’m surprised you weren’t afraid.” Gwen gasped. Zefir reached over and scratched behind Gwen’s ears. The cat maid meowed in surprise but leaned into his hand.

“Oh that?” The cat boy said, “In my old life, it's a pretty common element in our videogames. As a matter of fact me and my friends enjoyed them as children…”

*“Your childhood games involve monsters yelling and bursting out?”* Kvaris laughed, her tone in utter disbelief.

“Yeah…” Zefir purred, “Jumpscares are for children.”

“What kind of heartless world do you live in!?” the cat girl maid exclaimed.

\_\_\_

**Meyer House, Lakeview IL, Another Earth:**

Neith’s Aquila and Falcis drones flew into the basement and parked themselves on opposite corners, lighting up the dark basement. Ingrid and Cecil found themselves looking at a recreation room. There was a soccer table in the middle of the room, a billiards set to the left and a ping-pong table to the right. Shelves contained various board games ranging from the classics such as Monopoly and Mastermind to more obscure ones like Hungry Hungry Hippos. A 1980s tower stereo stood against the opposite wall, on the corner a gargantuan PVM-4300 nested atop an antique but very sturdy and decorative lowboy chest drawer. 

“Perks of the job I say..."" Cecil whistled as he saw colossal TV. ""Looks like the man of the house knows how to spend his money.""

""Agreed..."" Ingrid nodded, smiling.

""*What are we looking at here?*"" Gwen asked.

“The largest CRT TV monitor.” Ingrid replied, “Made using older technologies. Of course, today we can make them thinner, lighter, and cheaper. Still, only a few of these were manufactured-”

“*Which makes them valuable…*” Viel cut in.

“That’s right, Kitty-Five.” Cecil replied, nodding, “That said, its true value is only with us Earthlings who live decades ahead of this era. Nobody makes TV’s like this anymore, which makes this a collector’s item. The ones you’ve seen are pretty thin, right? Like mirrors.”

“*Mhmm..*” Viel said, “*So what you’re looking at now is a fat TV?*”

“Right.” Ingrid said, “the technology to produce pictures in our era uses much smaller, lighter parts. We’re looking at something that weighs as much as a big deer, or a bull elk.”

“*Ooooh.*” Viel remarked. “*That doesn’t sound very convenient to carry around at all…*”

“How they even carried it down here is a mystery…” Ingrid wondered, she looked up at the ceiling but it didn’t look like there were any new sections suggesting it was brought down via a hole in the ceiling.

Ingrid and Cecil shrugged. It didn’t matter.

“Commencing clearing operation.” Ingrid announced. There was a door in the basement but rather than lead to some ominous steps down to a sub-basement like in horror stories, it only led to a bathroom. Ingrid first got to work hauling all the bathroom supplies and chemicals she could find, placing them atop the billiards table.

**Autumnhollow, Terragalia:**

“It’s quite remarkable how those tee-vees got much thinner…” Vorque replied as he finished off his stuffed creamy roll, meowing at the delicious taste.

“We should ask them how they do it.” he continued but Nive shook his head, purring delightedly as he enjoyed his coffee.

“I doubt such an advancement would either be well-known or be bothered to be known…” Nive muttered, “Just think of the magical artifacts we use… most of the time we don’t know exactly how they work, we just know that they do.”

The two cats were purring as they poured more coffee from the pot.

**Meyer House, Lakeview IL, Another Earth:**

“*Parkooooour!*” Kinu and Kvaris echoed from the stairwell.

""Talk to me, Starchaser."" Philia said as her team completed a sweep of the garage, one of Viel’s fire birds was perched atop a bar stool, the type with a bare metal backrest, allowing the bird to illuminate the pitch-black garage without being a fire hazard. She paused to look up as she heard feet stampeding upstairs for a short moment, followed by a brief scuffle.

""*Found us some Monopoly.*"" Ingrid said as Philia got to work handing to the golden mice clones objects for them to take back to the dining room, starting with flammable chemicals. She directed Peanut with the same task, showing her what signs to look for. 

“Take it.” Philia said, taking a heavy jerry can herself and bringing it to the dining room “Who knows, we can make money out of recreating and selling that game to the Terragalia market.”

""*Think we can get rich by introducing the concept of paper money in Terragalia?*"" Ingrid inquired. 

“They already exist,” Philia replied as she quickly stepped back into the garage. She began taking the big plastic crates one by one and replacing their contents with only those she deemed useful, such as tools, bottles of solvents, oil, other chemicals, and even rags that looked clean enough.

""*You mean like the Honored Notes?*"" Kinu asked, opening up a closet. 

\_\_\_

Leading the upstairs group, Sammy saw the stairway lead up to a corridor that stretched to…

“*North and south…*” she said quietly to herself as she checked her wristwatch. She was sure she heard an Avarice growl softly somewhere  up there. Years riding ahead of the tribe had sharpened her ears to the sounds of lurking danger.

“Shhh… I hear something!” Selphie hissed.

“Get ready…S-sammy!” Siria protested as Sammy suddenly took off.

“Enthanas take the south-end, I’ll take the north!” She said excitedly, leaping up to the wall on her left and kicking off to mantle up the railing opposite. As she did so, glowing butterflies flooded the corridor’s ceiling, prompting a strangled groan from the Avarice lurking upstairs. 

The Enthana sisters did the same.

“Parkoooour!” The Enthanas chorused, their voices having that excited canine whine sound when a wolf found prey.

“Three at the corridor, north-side!” Sammy yelled as she charged ahead to engage.

“Two at the south-side!” The Enthanas cried in unison. 

“H-hey!” Siria shouted as she quickly leapt up as well, but it was too late, Sammy had dashed forward, summoning her halberd and skewering the first Avarice right in the crystal, shattering it, The monster crumbled into broken clay before the conjured Guardian Swords glowed into existence like a pair of scissors and bisected the other two. A fourth Avarice burst out of the closet to her right, but her Janus blade swiftly materialized to slice off its hands. Simultaneously, Sammy unsummoned her halberd and punched its chest crystal, cracking it before the hidden blade of her duregar war-gauntlet burst out to shatter the stone for good. The mud-crab sized insects tumbled to the ground screeching before curling and dying from shock, well before their host collapsed and crumbled like poorly-made pottery. 

“Ermmm…”

The fifth that stumbled out of the door never made it to Sammy. Cuddly had leapt up the railing. Perching atop it, he waved his wand, summoning a fae harrier to smash the Avarice’s knees. A second harrier smashed its head into the ground as it faceplanted. 

 

“Clear?” Siria asked as she mantled up the railings.

“Clear.” The orc and garms replied, hurrying back to the landing. 

“Door on that south-end is ajar, nothing’s coming out though…” Kvaris observed.

“We’ll leave it for later.” Siria replied.

“*Team,*” Neith said over the radio, audible only to the ones who went upstairs. ”*Recommend you only split up in two groups so as not to spread out Cuddly’s butterflies too much.*”

“Roger.” Siria said, motioning the team to try out the closest doors. The Umbra mice took point in front of the doors, shotguns ready. Siria and Kvaris opened both doors simultaneously and the butterflies swarmed in. Seeing no threats inside, the golden mice clones and Umbra fireteams entered first, followed by Kinu and Kvaris in one room, Siria and Sammy in the other. 

“*Check under the beds first.*” Neith said. The mice quickly dropped to their bellies and aimed down, with a squeak of relief they found them empty. 

\_\_\_

Meanwhile, back at the hall, Cuddly, Selphie and Lakota stationed themselves near the doors. Cuddly kept shifting his ears to check for any unfamiliar sounds. His Fae Harriers orbited around the three of them in leisurely patterns; Selphie faced one side of the corridor and Lakota the other. Where the Lakota team had their floodlights trained on their end, Selphie on her side deployed a bioluminescent blossom at her side of the corridor. A flower from her antler-like branches opened up to shoot a glowing seed the size of a quail's egg. Halfway through its flight it quickly unfurled into a big lotus a foot wide, causing it to gently descend to the floor. It was the same blossom she had summoned in the battle of the clearing earlier, just one of the many abilities it had thanks to Philia playing God with biological weapons.

 

“A telescope?” Kvaris frowned at the object mounted on a tripod, she whisked away at the curtains but saw a row of houses right across the street. The telescope was angled upwards and its sights were perpendicular. It looked all wrong.

““Enlighten me, Glados.” Kvaris said, “What am I looking at?”

“*That’s an astronomy telescope.*” Neith said. “*The occupant of this room had a hobby for viewing the stars. Take it. We could make use of it to reconnoiter this Rift World… assuming the fog lets up.*”

As they spoke, the mice, seeing that the sky had gone dark, quickly drew the curtains, to minimize attention towards the house.

“Agreed.” Kvaris said. 

It was at that point that Ingrid and Philia talked about paper money.

""You mean like the Honored Notes?"" Kinu asked, opening up a closet. Like the “laundry room” downstairs there were gaps in clothing as well as some knicknacks she couldn’t identify.

“*Nothing of value here.*” Neith said. “*Move on.*”

""*Honored notes? No, more like the Cefiro Missives.*"" Philia said, “*There’s also Laerothi Sealed Ducats, whoever holds those little notes affixed with their seal holds its value in gold.*""

“*Is that paper money?*” Cecil inquired.

“*Yup.*” came Philia’s affirmation. 

The Enthana girls groaned at the mention of those accursed missives and chuckled amongst themselves.

“*What’s wrong? Cefiro Missives sound cool.*” Ingrid said.

“Legally speaking they can work as far as Veles.” Kvaris chuckled, she had worked out how to collapse the telescope and was now folding up the tripod. “But… only the most powerful and/or richest merchants and aristocrats would deal in them. Even the old coot, THE Amaduscia Enthana is hard-pressed to get others to take the either missives or sealed ducats.”

“*Guess it’ll take a while for others to catch onto fiat money.*” Cecil remarked. 

“*You use missives on Earth?*” Kinu asked, mice threw atop the bed what books, comics and magazines they could find. She then used the bedsheets to bundle them all up, including the pillows.

“*We do,*” Ingrid said. 

""Can't say Freid loves the idea.” Kvaris said as she motioned for everyone to prepare to leave the room.

“If it comes to large transactions we usually prefer Honored notes.” Kvaris continued, she waited for everyone to leave the room before closing the door, Cuddly’s butterflies being the last to exit.

At the same time, Sammy and Siria completed their sweep of their assigned room, also using a bedsheet to bundle up their finds. She then pointed at the last three doors for them to check out. 

\_\_\_

Meanwhile, Siria opened up a closet, her eyes lighting up as she saw a good amount of linens, blankets, towels, and pillow cases. She quickly threw them onto the bed, using its sheet to wrap everything up.

“...and if you're adventuring, nothing beats real gold.” Kvaris continued, her voice echoing slightly through the corridor.

“I suppose if I found myself always in the comforts of a big city I won't have problems changing hands with sealed ducats or steel billets,” Kinu added as she and Kvaris unfurled one blanket and used it to bag the contents of the closet. 

“I don’t know…” Sammy frowned as she helped pile in the linens “If I'm far from the King's hand then I'd rather have money that can speak for itself.""

“Same.” Siria replied “I prefer coins harvested from gold.”

\_\_\_

As her teammates rooted around the two rooms, the door that was ajar opened. Selphie kept her aim on the Avarice that stumbled out. She held her fire and waited for it to approach. 

“Suika, to team, one Avarice sighted, dealing with it.” Selphie advised.

“*Acknowledged, Suika, handle at your discretion.*” Philia replied.

“Steady, Kiowa…” Selphie said as the mice let out a short squeak of alarm.

“Ermmm…” Cuddly murmured, eating a carrot.

The glowing lotus blossom erupted a volatile golden cloud of glittering pollen, causing the Avarice to gasp and wheeze as the corrosive pollen began rapidly eating away at the body. There was no need to worry about it making a hole through the floor as Selphie’s floramancy meant she was able to control the intensity of the pollen. In this case, it was only extremely caustic to living matter.

The gem dropped to the wooden floor with a hollow thud as the mice squeaked happily in appreciation. 

There was barely anything left of the Avarice, the parasites melted well before they could exit the body.

1lhqtxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/RiceCookerJunkie/comments/1lhqtxg/toshiba_rice_cooker_6_cup_uncooked_japanese_rice/,Toshiba Rice Cooker 6 Cup Uncooked – Japanese Rice Cooker with Fuzzy Logic Review,"# From Rice Skeptic to Enthusiast: My 30 Days with the Toshiba Fuzzy Logic Rice Cooker

After a month of daily use, I've gone from questioning single-purpose appliances to wondering how I ever lived without this sleek kitchen game-changer. If you're on the fence about rice cookers, here's my honest experience with the Toshiba TRCS01.

## The Basics - Looks & Design

The Toshiba rice cooker strikes a perfect balance between form and function. With its modern black and stainless steel finish, it doesn't scream ""bulky appliance"" and takes up roughly the same counter space as a standard coffee maker. The display is crisp and intuitive enough that I didn't immediately need to consult the manual (a rare win for kitchen tech).

What really impressed me was the sturdy non-stick inner pot. As someone who values easy cleanup above almost everything else in the kitchen, this feature alone was worth the investment.

## Where It Really Shines: The ""Fuzzy Logic""

Despite sounding like marketing nonsense, the fuzzy logic technology is legitimately impressive. This intelligent system actually adjusts cooking time and temperature based on the moisture content of your rice. I've experimented with:

* White rice
* Brown rice
* Wild rice blends
* Steel-cut oatmeal

Every single option has come out with perfect texture - no mushy rice, no burnt bottoms, just consistently excellent results.

## Versatility Beyond Just Rice

This isn't just a one-trick pony. Beyond basic rice cooking, I've used:

* The porridge setting for morning oatmeal
* The steam function for vegetables while rice cooks below
* Quick rice option for those ""I forgot dinner"" emergencies
* Keep warm function (maintains temperature for up to 24 hours!)

## Specifications at a Glance

| Feature | Details |
|:--------|:--------|
| Capacity | 6 cups uncooked (12 cups cooked) |
| Cooking Functions | White Rice, Brown Rice, Mixed Rice, Multi-grain, Quick Rice, Porridge, Steel-Cut Oats |
| Technology | Fuzzy Logic with 3D cooking |
| Keep Warm | Up to 24 hours |
| Delay Timer | Yes, programmable up to 24 hours |
| Accessories | Steaming basket, measuring cup, rice spatula |
| Dimensions | 10.6 x 13.9 x 8.4 inches |

## The Good and The ""Could Be Better""

### Pros:
* **Foolproof results** every single time
* **Multi-tasking capabilities** with the steamer function
* **Keep-warm function** that doesn't dry out your food
* **Actually easy to clean** non-stick pot (not just ""non-stick"" in name)
* **Quiet operation** - no annoying kitchen noise
* **Retractable power cord** for neat storage
* **User-friendly interface** even for tech-challenged cooks

### Cons:
* 6-cup capacity might not be enough for larger families
* The completion beep is pretty loud with no volume control
* Steam release can be surprisingly forceful
* Would love preset options for quinoa and other trending grains
* Takes up permanent counter space (though it's earned its spot)

## Is It Worth It?

After a month of use, I can confidently say this rice cooker has transformed my weeknight cooking routine. If you eat rice with any regularity or want to simplify meal prep without sacrificing quality, the Toshiba TRCS01 is absolutely worth the investment.

The fuzzy logic technology isn't just marketing—it delivers consistent, perfect results regardless of what type of rice or grain you're cooking. For around $135 (currently on sale from its regular price), you're getting restaurant-quality rice at home with minimal effort.

Whether you're a rice cooking novice who burns it on the stovetop (like I was) or a discerning home chef looking for perfect texture every time, this appliance delivers outstanding value for its price point.

I have heard that viruses are more common on PCs than Apples. I am currently in a job where I work with a lot of large data in microsoft excel. I purchased a Lenovo laptop with a ridiculous amount of RAM. I love it. One of my only critiqes is how often advertisements from Lenovo pop up on the bottom left hand side of the screen. Sometimes the anti-virus thing pops up, but I have worked enough with PCs to know that is common. 

My question is if PCs have pop ups on the computer itself (not talking about web browsing), does that make it easer to target unsuspecting individuals?

I’m a 54 yearold farmer, and this story has been eating at me for a few days now. I honestly don’t know if I went too far, but here goes.

  


I own a decent sized piece of farmland in a rural area, and for the past few weeks, a group of teenagers from town has decided that my land is their personal parking lot. It started with one or two cars on weekends, then more showed up. At first, I figured they were just parking for a bit and didn’t think much of it. But then they started coming more often louder, rowdier, and more disrespectful every time.

  


They’d park along the edge of one of my fields land that I very clearly own and maintain. They’d blast music, scream laugh late into the night, and even throw rocks at my goats and chickens like it was a carnival game. One of them actually climbed on top of my old tractor for “selfies.” I tried being polite at first I walked out and asked them to leave. That only got me some sarcastic “Yes, sir” and exaggerated salutes, followed by laughter as they peeled out, leaving tire tracks in the dirt.

  


I put up a sign “PRIVATE PROPERTY – NO PARKING” in big bold red letters. They knocked it over and spray painted a smiley face on it.

  


The final straw came last week when they were out there again, this time in four separate cars, blaring some bass-heavy garbage at 11 PM. I had an early morning of work ahead and couldn’t sleep. I yelled from my porch to get off my land. One of them shouted back, “It’s free country, boomer!”

  


Well. If it’s a free country, I guess I’m free to plow my own damn field.

  


The next morning was plow day. It had rained a bit the night before, so the ground was soft perfect for my tractor and awful for car tires. I went out with my plow and did my usual work but I made sure to do a very thorough job plowing around their parked cars. I didn’t touch their vehicles, but I plowed the soil nice and deep around them in every direction. With the rain and the churned dirt, it turned into thick, sticky mud.

  


When they came back later that afternoon, they were furious. One of the trucks got stuck trying to drive out. Another car’s wheels spun until they gave up and called a tow. I just sat on my porch, sipping coffee and watching like it was a Netflix special.

  


Later, one of their parents came by to chew me out for “trapping their kids.” I calmly pointed out that they were on private property without permission, had ignored my signs, and disrespected me multiple times. They called me petty. I said, “If I can’t protect my own land, what can I protect?”

  


Now some people in town are calling me “Farmer Jerk” and saying I escalated things unnecessarily. I didn’t touch their cars, I just plowed my field. My field that they shouldn’t have been on in the first place.

  


So Reddit, AITA?

I’ve lost 25lbs since then but mainly because I’ve had a lot of GI issues related to GERD (which is new since starting Zep) so I’ve had to DRASTICALLY change my diet. My doc prescribed famotadine after a serious bout of heartburn that felt like I was having a heart attack. The change in diet and famotadine helped, but I’ve had serious constipation which famotadine just made worse. I started Metamucil and stool softeners and drink at least 100 oz of water, but still feel like a woodland animal every time I go💩.

Then I upped the dose to .5 one week ago and the sulphur burps hit and the constipation hit new levels🤢 So I added digestive enzymes and have cut out red meat. A few days ago I took some MiraLAX and sweet relief from the constipation. I’m now adding a half capful to my coffee. Some of the constipation comes from another med I take that causes constipation, so not all Zep’s fault.

I’m taking so many new meds/supplements to deal with the side effects!  Metamucil, stool softeners, famatodine, digestive enzymes and MiraLax. Sheesh. I hope these side effects dissipate as time goes on.

I also need to move more as I’m sure that will help too. 

I don’t have any questions- just venting. I’m not really liking this med so far. Yes I dropped a lot of weight, but the GI issues overshadow it. Nothing to do but press on I s’pose.

If you made it this far, thank you for listening. 🙂

**Why This Pick?**  


A game at Coors Field with Antonio Senzatela (6.72 ERA) & Brandon Pfaadt (5.38 ERA) on the mound? A game total of 50 runs wouldn’t shock me under this circumstance (lol). Both of these guys have given up their fair share of runs over their last 5 starts, and at hitter friendly Coors Field, this game should see plenty of scoring. Senzatela is currently sporting a Home ERA of 7.51, while Pfaadt has a staggering 6.53 ERA on the road. I know it’s a big number, but I’m on the Over to cash here, friends.

It’s big.

It’s heavy.

And it’s way more high maintenance than I expected.

But despite everything, I’d probably buy it again.

# The arrival was deceptively easy

Assembly took 20 minutes with the included tools.

Nothing wild. Everything aligned. I didn’t even need to look at Youtube.

But here’s what surprised me: this table is solid. Like, truly solid. 

The moment I flipped it upright, it felt like furniture you’d pass down, not something from a flat-pack kit.

The finish looked gorgeous too.

But that beauty came with baggage.

# You can’t treat it like cheap furniture

First lesson? This is not a wipe-and-forget kind of table.

Within a week, I left a water glass overnight and woke up to a faint ring.

Acacia wood doesn’t play.

If you’re planning to use this like a $200 coffee table, you’re going to be frustrated fast.

# Outdoor-friendly doesn’t mean weatherproof

The product listing says it can work outdoors. Sure—on a covered patio.

I left it near an open window once during a summer storm.

Not great.

The slatted top helps with drainage, yes. But if rain hits directly? It’ll soak in.

You *must* oil or seal it if you plan to keep it outside.

# Cleaning was surprisingly easy

Mild soap. Damp cloth. Done.

No funky polish needed. No stress.

Dust doesn’t seem to stick as badly as with glass tables either, which is a huge win.

The lower shelf collected more clutter than I expected, though.

# The lower shelf: functional or clutter trap?

I had big plans for stylish baskets.

What I got instead? Old remotes, half-read books, a game controller, and some random candles.

It holds weight well, but visually? It adds noise unless you keep it organized.

# Moving it is annoying

This table weighs 40 to 50 pounds, but it feels heavier due to how bulky it is.

Dragging it across the rug was a two-person job unless I wanted to risk snapping the legs.

If you like to re-arrange furniture often, this might not be your favorite.

# How the finish aged

The color held up well indoors. Still a soft teak tone, no yellowing or weird fading.

But don’t skip oiling it every few months.

Dry air will rough it up. And crumbs? They love getting trapped between the slats.

# It handled spills better than I thought

Coffee, juice, soup (yes, soup).

Wiped up quickly with no stains as long as I caught them fast.

If I waited too long, the wood absorbed a bit. Nothing permanent, but noticeable.

# What I wish I knew before buying

* You *need* coasters. Always.  
* Don’t put it outdoors unless you seal it.  
* The grain and color might not match the photo.  
* The shelf is a magnet for junk.  
* You’ll want furniture pads or feet if you have delicate floors.  

# Would I buy it again?

Yes.

Despite the quirks, this is a legit piece of furniture.

It feels expensive, even though it wasn’t.

It fits my space and style perfectly. And after a few months of learning what not to do, it’s been reliable, beautiful, and worth it.

# Who it’s for (and who should skip it)

Buy this if:

* You want a solid wood table that looks way more expensive than it is  
* You don’t mind light maintenance every few months  
* You like neutral, modern furniture that doesn’t scream for attention  

Skip this if:

* You hate using coasters  
* You want something lightweight or easily movable  
* You don’t have time to oil wood or organize shelves

Summary: Aziraphale could always rely on Crowley just as Crowley could always rely on him. Their friendship and The Arrangement had grown and changed over the years, but it remained the one steadfast thing in Aziraphale’s life. As he finally took the step of leaving behind his job at the publishing firm his family had founded, he took comfort in knowing that some things didn’t have to change.

Crowley loved Aziraphale. As the two of them began embarking on a new phase of their lives, he wanted their relationship to enter a new phase too. It would take some effort, but Crowley was determined to show Aziraphale what their future could hold, together. He had a plan.

# Chapter 3: The First Day of the Rest of Your Life

>Crowley frowned and grumbled at the beam of light that hit his face. He reached for the blanket to block it out, but his fingers hit open air. It explained why he was cold. He opened his eyes reluctantly. A warm honey oak bedside table swam into view, and he smiled despite feeling a little chilled.

>“Morning,” he called out toward Aziraphale’s favourite reading chair.

>“Good morning,” his husky voice replied from the doorway. “I made you a coffee.”

>“You’re a prince,” Crowley told him, rolling over onto his back. He sat up and lifted the cup from the coaster on the bedside table. After a deep sniff, he took a sip. “You could come back over here and join me, you know.”

>Aziraphale leaned against the door jamb, mug of tea in one hand, the other resting conspicuously in his dressing gown pocket. He pouted a little. “I was enjoying the view.”

TLDR; love my relationship, but having a hard time accepting certain needs will never be met. How much is normal to sacrifice?


Hi Reddit! I (30F) am in a relationship which I cherish (he is 35M). We have similar values, lifestyles, and enjoy similar hobbies and each others company. We have a similar vision for our future. He listens, he is kind, humble, handsome and just an amazing man. I feel safe with him, we have fun, we hype eachother up, and we work to support each other as much as we can. 

However, I have realized that I will have to forgo some of my needs to stay in this relationship. For example, I really love thoughtful gifts- they make me feel special and seen. From someone making me a cup of coffee in the morning because I’m in a rush, to a sweet anniversary gift, to flowers- these things make me feel sexy and wanted. He will get these things when I ask very specifically, but then I feel disappointed that it no longer feels like a thoughtful surprise. I have communicated this many times, and at this point realize if I stay I will have to forgo this need probably for the rest of my life if I decide to stay. 

In addition, I have really wanted a deeper emotional connection. While we have a great time and get along so well, I wish he would ask me deeper things about myself and really try to see me, to connect to my soul. To stay up with me, listening to my fears and talking about the future. I also realize if I stay, while I do feel safe to express myself freely, I probably won’t get the depth, as it’s been 2 years and probably won’t change. 

Anyways. I love this man but wonder if I can sacrifice these things I really want for the rest of my life. What percent of your needs do you give up to be in a relationship? I’m trying to get a good benchmark. ",8,1750606204.0,relationship_advice,34,0.83,False
1lhqlft,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lhqlft/aita_for_not_wanting_to_tell_my_best_friend_that/,AITA for not wanting to tell my best friend that our entire friend group hates her brother,"This is my first ever Reddit post, and I was inspired to write it by watching Charlotte and the potato queens on YouTube. I don't really know what I'm trying to say here, but I need to get it off my chest. It might be a long one.

I (18F) am a recent high school graduate. I had some trouble making friends in my freshman and sophomore years, especially due to the pandemic and the way that it restructured life for everyone. I met my best friend, let's call her Taryn (18F) when we were both sophomores. We clicked immediately, but she had other friends that she was focused on and our relationship was pretty surface level until the middle of junior year. We have the same name, so people started calling us ""(insert name) squared"" because we were together so often. Our families are both Christian, have a lot of children, have the same girl to boy ratio, are both homeschooled, and both me and Taryn are pretty bubbly people. We became close almost overnight, and she has been a huge part of my life ever since. She's so sweet and talkative, always down to have a good time, and someone that I've come to rely on.

We live 50 minutes apart, but we see each other at least three times per week at each other's houses, various events, or hangouts. I've been on full overnight trips with her family before. Over the course of the past year or so, I've been noticing some things about her. Well, to be more specific, my mom has made me aware of some things about her (I love my mom). 

She asked me one day if I felt that Taryn was drama. I was surprised and said something like no, of course not. We're just two girls having fun, right? But my mom explained to me that she thought I was a little blind when it came to Taryn, likely because I'd never had a best friend like that before. I wanted to spend all my time with her, FaceTime her every night, and she fully reciprocated that obsession. My mom saw that I was starting to talk less and less to my other friends, and she saw differences in the way that I talked and specifically, the way that I was starting to treat people. 

I have always been a generally inclusive person- I want to be the person that I wish I'd known in the first half of high school. But Taryn is... well, I love her, but she's very cliquey and gossipy. She's really really pretty and she always wants to hang out with other really pretty people. She's never said this, but you can see it in the way she treats people that aren't as universally physically attractive as she is. Taryn had two other best friends in high school before I came along, and all of them magically had these falling outs that led to none of them speaking for months after the friendship breakups. She also badmouthed both of these girls to me and convinced me to dislike the more recent ex best friend by telling me a bunch of things that happened between them that I later found out were lies. So I was kind of cold to this poor girl for no real reason, but I did think that she had done my best friend dirty, so I can't really blame myself for that too much. You want to be able to trust the people you love, right.

Taryn can be very manipulative (as the whole ex best friend thing illustrates) and can and will throw her girl friends under the bus to talk to guys. She had never done it to me before, so I kind of excused it, but that was a mistake.

There's a pretty good amount of guys and girls in our friend group, and we all hang out regularly, so there's bound to be girls and guys pairing up. This one guy in particular, let's call him Tony (17M), is a main ringleader in our friend group. He's insanely popular, kind of a gossip, but also really really nice. He makes a lot of the plans and also hosts because he is the only sibling left in his house, so it's almost a treat for his mom to have guests. Tony and Taryn started talking basically the day they met, but Taryn was involved with another guy at that point so they didn't really become a ""thing"" until the start of senior year, which was this past September or so. She had me wingman her all the time, which I was happy to do because I thought they were cute, and she wanted to talk about him 24/7. It was Tony Tony Tony Tony. We'd FaceTime late at night and I fell asleep to Tony Tony Tony Tony. This was actually the very first thing we ever fought over. I tried to explain to her that I loved her and I supported her in this friendship turned to maybe something (it was a situationship at that point) but I did also want to talk about other things sometimes and I felt like we were hyper fixating on this guy. She got defensive and began to gaslight me, saying that she only talked about him sometimes and because it seemed like I wanted to. She insisted that I point out specific times when she had talked about him for too long and whatever, basically, you get the point. Taryn was obsessed with this boy and she was letting our friendship suffer because of it. My favorite example of this was when she asked me to go to his house with her (she wasn't allowed to go to his house) and stand outside for two hours so she could talk to this boy without ""actually breaking her dad's rule and going inside the house (her parents hadn't met his parents, so they weren't comfortable with it). It was raining, cold, and late, so we both got bronchitis.

Anyway, they said ""I like you"" a few weeks later and then Taryn panicked. She decided that actually, this guy was immature and drama and she definitely had no interest in that. I was kind of nodding along, still content to do whatever she wanted as long as she stayed my friend. My mom says I basically spent half of our friendship catering to this girl, and I think that might be partially true. Taryn broke things off with Tony and basically broke his heart, though she spun it to be like ""it's not me, it's your fault"" and get everyone on her side.

She went through another crush our friend group that ended up being not reciprocated, so she's now between crushes. Or so I thought. 

Recently, I have been putting myself out there more and I actually made a lot of friends. I have joined a theater club, attended senior events, invited girls out for coffee and really made a point to talk to new people. I'm really proud of myself for this, but Taryn still wants to hang out with the same group over and over again. This isn't a bad thing, but it means that I am not longer available to her at all times and we've definitely gotten less attached at the hip. I am much happier being in this headspace where I have friends that make me feel loved, valued, and uplifted. 

This caused some drama between me and Taryn at my 18th birthday party. I decided to invite around 30 people that I really like and have a party on my lawn with karaoke, a fire pit, sparklers, balloons, that sort of thing. It was very low-key and I honestly had a fantastic time, I was so happy. The thing is, Taryn was walking off and being depressed for a lot of it. She would grab one girl at a time and bring them into the bathroom together so they could talk, she knew everyone there but only talked to the ones from our shared friend group, she wouldn't participate in the group games, and she seemed generally annoyed. She has a bit of an RBF so it was hard for me to tell if she was having a good time or not as I can't always read her resting face. 

My mom was watching and she said that it seemed like Taryn was mad that all of the attention was on me, as she looked extra annoyed during the cupcakes and the singing and squished herself in to sit right next to me and throw her arms around me. 

I sent her some of the pictures we took at my party after the fact, and she said she hated all of the ones I liked so I was like okay I will make sure not to share them then. I made an Instagram post and didn't include any of the ones with her because she didn't like them. I thought I was being a good friend, but she got mad at me. Anyway.

I still hang out with our shared friend group, of course, and I've been getting closer with others in that group that aren't Taryn as well. Really, 2025 has been a good year for me when it comes to friendships. I feel like I'm really growing into the woman I was called to be.

Taryn has a little brother that I'm going to call Timmy (15M). I also have a 15 year old brother, Callan (M) and they are friendly. Callan has actually been friends with some of the guys in my friend group longer than I have, as we're all homeschooled and that is more normal than it would be in a public school setting. He's generally a very chill, easygoing guy and everyone likes him.

Timmy, on the other hand, is kind of a try hard. He likes attention, just like Taryn, and he's a bit immature. A lot of the guys in our friend group don't really like him, but Taryn's family is close in a way that's kind of creepy and she always insists on bringing him to everything. I only bring Callan to a hangout like once per month at the most. He has his own friends, and he's happy with them, but he does like my crew too and we get along well with everyone.

Anyway, Taryn and Tony have fought in the past (yes, they're still friends) about her bringing Timmy to events. Tony thinks that Timmy is annoying and doesn't fit in which I don't know if I agree with because he's a really nice kid, he's just in a different stage of life compared to the rest of us. We talk about driving, jobs, parties, college, and he's just made it to high school. He's also a bit socially awkward. Taryn takes this personally and has gone at Tony and made it a huge debate within our friend group because she insists that her brother is welcome wherever she is. This is, unfortunately, looking like it's going to get her left out of a lot of hangouts. Her argument is that my brother is allowed, so hers should be also. Which isn't wrong, but it just makes the whole thing awkward because Timmy isn't friends with any of these people. He doesn't talk to or hang out with any of them outside of group activities like Callan does.

I don't know what to do- I know this friend group is not great or inclusive, but I also feel like I should say something. She is fully obstinate in her view that Timmy is not awkward at all, fits in great, and it's just Tony making problems. But see, her and Tony have been sneaking off alone together at the past few hangouts so I don't know what's going on there. But I know if I say something, I will basically join the enemy camp in her eyes and she will resent me for it. 

Last night, we were all walking around Tony's town after having dinner at his place, and Taryn texted me that she was coming and bringing Timmy. I relayed this to the group, and they all groaned audibly and tried to pay one of my friend's freshman age brothers to hang out with Timmy so he would leave us alone. I didn't tell that to Taryn and I'm feeling kind of guilty. What should I do about this whole mess?

AITA for not wanting to tell my best friend that our whole friend group hates her brother? 

  
Note: This whole situation makes me so happy that I'm going out of state for college in August let me tell you.

Whew. So after posting my original AITA, I genuinely didn’t expect *that* kind of response. Thank you to every single person who commented, DM’d, upvoted, and reminded me that I wasn’t crazy, bitter, dramatic, or “holding a grudge”—just a woman protecting her peace in a storm of generational dysfunction.

Here’s where we are now:

1. **Clarifications:**
   * My son was *never* going on this trip. It was supposed to be just my husband and me.
   * I do *not* allow my son to have any contact with Tina. My stance is simple: *If someone doesn’t like you, they’re a risk to your kids.* I stand on that.
   * Yes, I went back to the relationship after a year of distance and reflection. And yes… it was under the impression that he had changed. He hadn’t. He just got better at playing the role until March hit and the mask slipped.
2. **Therapy:**
   * We are in counseling. Not the “save it no matter what” kind—but the “can this even be saved or should we end this respectfully” kind.
   * He knows the damage has been done. He also knows my trust isn’t something that rebounds on command.
3. **The Conversation:**
   * I did speak to him about the post and showed him the responses. Spoiler alert: it didn’t go great. He apologized later… but at this point, it’s just a word.
   * I also sent a message to Tina. Not for closure, not for a reconciliation—but because she needed to hear it, and I needed to finally say it. Here's the message in full:

**To Tina:**

>

**What’s Next?**

* I *am* still going to the States—because a girl deserves a break.
* I’ll be spending that week sipping mimosas, catching up with my girls, laughing until it hurts, and living my best soft life.
* I will *not* be attending any family reunion, cookout, or gathering involving his people.
* He can go if he wants. But I’ve told him plainly: *You are free to visit your mother. I’m just not signing up to be the sacrificial lamb at another family function.*

**What I’ve learned from this...**

You are *not* obligated to accept an apology that comes too late, feels forced, or lacks changed behavior. You’re allowed to protect your peace. If they call that petty? call it **growth**!

Thank you again for all the support. If anything wild happens in this MIL saga, I’ll update y’all… but for now?

**Still unbothered. Still TTG. Still choosing peace.** 

**Bonus Tea ☕️:**

So after I showed my husband the post and all the responses… babyyyyyy, that man clutched his *invisible pearls*. 😂 He couldn’t even go to sleep right away—tossing and turning like he’d just been read for filth (because, well… he *was*). He hit me with, *“People really be on that Charlotte Reddit like that?”* And I was like, *Yup. That’s a community, baby. And clearly they say it how it is—even the stuff I needed to hear.* 👏🏽

Mind you, I’m always watching Charlotte’s videos on YouTube while cooking and he stays side-eyeing the screen… well, now he knows *why* I stay tuned in. Accountability, honesty, and no sugar-coating—just how I like my coffee and my clapbacks.

Okay. Chin up, shoulders back, lips stained in Emirates-approved red. I’m poised, polished, and passably elegant — to the untrained eye, at least. Except, there’s no such thing as an untrained eye here. Every other person is a Grooming Coordinator standing by to crosscheck every stray hair. And because one level of scrutiny is not enough, around every corner is a mirror.

Mirror checks today: 37 — Oh, wait, there’s another one — make that 38 mirror checks today.

Reprimands: 0 — but only because a batch-mate lent me their 24 hour lip stain. Mine was more Virgin red than Emirates red, apparently.

# Debrief - How Did I Get Here?

Yeah, that was not me. I’m behind that person.

According to everyone and everything, I am too quiet, too short, too awkward, too… *me*.

At thirteen, I hadn’t even outgrown my training bra when a personality test slapped a forever label on my forehead and told me, “Stop! You are an introvert, not suitable for Flight Attendant, and never will be.”

Even my friends gave me the *bless-your-heart* smirk and collective head tilt, saying I didn’t belong, because, amongst many other things, “Flight Attendants must be tall and pretty” and “have you looked in the mirror?”

And yet, I was selected to became Emirates Cabin Crew. But not until I’d endured nineteen interview failures. (*Yes, nineteen, don’t look at me like that.*)

One thing’s for sure, though, my uniform isn’t perfectly-tailored, but neither am I, and that’s okay, because I became one of the twelve ab-initios in batch 744 who made it through the gruelling Flight Attendant training.

And while I was waiting around for that clipped wing to materialise on my lapel, I discovered Emirates don’t even award wings to female Cabin Crew.

# Grooming Check

Oh, speaking of lapels, quick multi-point grooming inspection — wouldn’t want to get carded at my own graduation ceremony.

Hat? — I perform the customary Emirates salute. The rim rests precisely two finger widths above my not-so-perfectly-penciled brows — check.

Skirt? — Not tucked into knickers. Excellent.

Blouse? — Ruined because my helpful boyfriend didn’t realise it was dry-clean only — thankfully camouflaged below…

Neatly pressed, but oversized boxy jacket — check.

Veil — cascading gracefully to nipple height, masking both my blouse and the nervous tic wreaking havoc on my cheek — check.

# The New Faces of Emirates Airline

The iconic Emirates melody crescendos over the loudspeaker, a sound we’ve all heard at the beginning of open days, but never as the soundtrack to our achievement. One by one, flags burst onto the screen and names echo through the auditorium. A roll call of nations, each name carrying stories, some struggles, and, now, victories.

Announcing the newest faces of Emirates Airline:

# Debrief - I Memorised Virgin's Elimination Door

Seeing my batchmates smile as the presenter announces their names, brings back memories of my first ever interview at Virgin Atlantic, seven years earlier.

The recruiters called two names, and those applicants exited through the left door. The rest of us — thirteen in total — headed towards the right door.

Outside the interview room, our misguided faces wore those same confident smiles, convinced we were the successful group. We expected to be ushered towards a jet or the swimming pool. Instead, we were herded through the elimination door.

That Virgin interview became the first in a series of my string of nineteen failures, capped by one walk-of-shame bailout — with more than a few interviews abandoned at the curb like dirty old cigarette butts.

Over seven years, I stared at Virgin’s elimination door so often, I memorised it down to its hinges and that blasted “pull to open” sign.

# Eliminations Aren’t Over

The blunders didn’t stop during Emirates training, and neither had the eliminations.

One of our batch-mates vanished somewhere between Group Medical Training and graduation. Another deferred, giving herself more time to pass.

I thought I knew all the rejection doors, but then, during Security and Emergency Procedures training, Emirates handed me the ultimate door, the emergency exit, loaded with grab handles and red warning signs and real reach tests. No “pull to open” this time. Just “brace brace evacuate.” Turns out, I didn’t need to grow taller, however my voice needed to grow much louder. It barely cut through the hiss of hydraulics.

And then, in week three,my team had to fish me out of the ditching pool when it became painfully clear I couldn’t swim after all. Which, according to the “Old Wives,” should’ve disqualified me.

After turning the training pool into a rescue operation, I sat shivering and alone in the raft, bracing for rejection #20.

Instead, my face is on the big screen, featured in an Emirates graduation ad and there’s a scrolled certificate on the table with my name on it.

# My Turn

Stage left. A Union Jack unfurls on the screen. My name flashes up. Showtime.

I’m so charged, I could scream loud enough to clear an entire jumbo in under 80 seconds flat — if anyone dared to spot test me, which they won’t because that part’s over.

No more tests. No more simulators. We’re moving from jumpsuits to jump-seats, aboard our supernumerary flights on Sunday.

It’s been a grueling couple of months from recruitment through on-boarding and training — all blurring into one long, sleep-deprived haze. Perfect makeup and the Emirates veil do the heavy lifting of faking composure. The rest is thanks to adrenaline and the grace of Costa Coffee — it seems there’s one for every mirror.

But all the practical training, the exam cramming, sleepless nights, near drownings, the never-ending medicals, the sweltering heat, and ruthless grooming demands, seem so trivial compared to the twelve-year battle it took just to slip my feet into a pair of Emirates Hush Puppy heels.

I walk across the stage. The presenter shakes my hand. “Congratulations”. Hands me a neatly scrolled certificate.

I take my place beside my batch-mates, this time, stage right.

I can’t believe it. I can finally say the words I dreamed of since 13 years old — I am a Flight Attendant.

# Debrief - Old Wives and the Unrelenting Cycle of Ambiguous Feedback

In the end, none of my blunders prevented my success. What almost prevented it was falling prey to the echo-chamber of industry myths and misinformation.

This is an industry where advice gets passed around like in-flight peanuts. And it’s alive with echo chambers — filled to the brim with hundreds of thousands of applicants, yet starved of honest feedback — so we’re at the mercy of old wives tales, faulty assumptions, and residual 20th century discrimination. Trouble is, the misinformation is peppered with just enough industry jargon and logic to sound credible.

Cue the unrelenting cycle of ambiguous feedback:

* ""Better not mention your love of travel, sounds superficial.""
* “Watch out for that secret reach test.”
* ""Oh, and every airline requires swimming, it's an international FAA regulatory requirement.""

Too many applicants memorise answers, follow cheatsheets, cultivate interview buddy systems, and dress like they already work there, hoping to outsmart the hiring process. And through nineteen failed interviews, I was one of them.

With no way to crosscheck or reality-check the claims, I followed all the so-called rules until I became paralysed by confusion and riddled with performance anxiety.

Instead of being me and pursuing my dream, my pursuit became about proving I could change.  
And I did change. I became a caricature.

At my nineteenth interview — an open day with Emirates — I walked into a banquet hall packed with over 100 applicants. It felt like stepping into a room of mirrors. A hundred versions of me, all clinging to the same stale advice. Everyone wore red. Everyone gave the same rehearsed answers.

We matched each other’s scripted smiles and over-eager hand raises. I watched it all unfold, again and again. Stunned to silence, this experience began to shape my perception. Then, I fell in sync with the recruiters.

I self-ejected before the official eliminations, but this time I left with clarity.

# Debrief - People like me do make it — Changing my thinking

I rushed home and used what the personality test labelled a handicap, my introverted nature, to research, study, and unpack the process like a combination lock.

I wrote about every one of my nineteen interviews, from Virgin, to CrossAir, to easyJet, to British Airways, and Emirates.

Over two-years, grinding my nose through annual reports and fiscal summaries I transformed bits of jargon into the ABCs and 123s of interview technique. Through this process I began thinking like an airline.

Then I learned to behave like cabin crew and began crosschecking.

It turns out, so much of what everyone told me about this career and the recruitment process is wrong:

* Airlines don’t hire introverts? Wrong.
* Flight attendants must be tall and pretty? Wrong.
* Swimming regulations? Wrong.

My Emirates success defied so many of the Old Wives’ “rules”.

Instead, I stepped into the role and behaved like cabin crew.

Two months after my final interview, Emirates delivered on its promise to “Make Someone’s Day” and I jetted out to its Aviation College in Dubai.

# Coaching Cues - There Is No Mould

You don’t have to “fit” some imagined, ideal mould to become cabin crew. Success isn’t about matching a template.

I hadn’t grown taller. I wasn’t any more extraverted. And I didn’t need to change my name to Cheryl.

And it’s not about being perfect either. In fact, the interview process is designed to force mistakes so Recruiters can see how you perform under pressure.

How about that? Mistakes are inevitable.

I succeeded against the industry's notorious razor-thin odds, at a time when Emirates received over 125,000 applications a year. Not because I was perfect, far from it. If there was a way to mess up a psychometric test, I was the one handing it in. If there was a wrong way to sit down, I had the bruises on my knee to prove it. I messed up at nearly every stage along the way.

# Debrief - I messed up at every stage

At my twentieth interview, I didn’t follow a single “must dress like you work there” grooming rule. I wore a powder blue, boys’ school uniform shirt with oversized collars sticking out. My waist-length hair, loose — bunless — and not a hint of Emirates’ signature red on me — not even an approved smidge of Clarins Passion-Red, lipstick.

If my appearance was skewed, you should have see the personality test I handed in. Misaligned answers, no eraser. *So scruffy!*

And if airlines only hire extraverts, I should have been the first eliminated because, during the group discussion, I wasn’t the most outspoken because two-dozen applicants erupted like a bird strike. When I *finally* managed to get a word in, another applicant started talking right over me mid-sentence.

By the time we came to the mini one-on-one’s, only seven of the original eighty applicants remained — I was one of them.

But the blunders weren’t over.

My nervous knee collided with the recruiter’s table so hard, she nearly called in the first-aider.

Two weeks later, I arrived for my final interview, and that same recruiter took one look at me, drew a blank, and sent me home. *I should have thrust my knee into the wall.*

And then I had seven sets of photos rejected. Yes, seven. How is that even possible?

But none of that mattered.

I got the Golden Call, which, of course, I missed. And then I overlooked the Golden Email, so that grew stale in my inbox for 5 days — until Emirates HR made one final courtesy call.

# Coaching Cues - Change Your Behaviour

What mattered then, and what matters now is authenticity.

That’s why some airlines, like Emirates, enforce strict dress codes for interviews — to strip away surface-level tricks. They want to see how you authentically handle yourself, not how good you are at following YouTube grooming tutorials.

So, if you find yourself in a room dressed like everyone else, how do you stand out?

You stand out by **behaving like Cabin Crew and approaching the process as you would a simulated flight** — because airlines don’t bring in desk-bound HR personnel with no operational experience to hire applicants.

Nope! They bring in seasoned professionals who know the job and the airline like the back of their gloved hands — Seniors, Pursers, former Flight Attendants, and Cabin Crew Trainers. AKA: Professional people-watchers, trained to spot dubious behaviour, including unsuitable applicants who recite memorised answers and wear fancy facades.

They don’t care about labels and quotas. They care about finding teammates who can improvise, adapt, and think on their feet, just like the job demands, and they have a vested interest in finding the right fit — not only for the airline and its corporate culture, but also for themselves because, one day, they might be bunking with you mid-flight, cross-checking your doors, and maybe sipping a coffee or cocktail with you in Paris.

That’s why airline recruitment doesn’t follow traditional formats. It’s a series of personality assessments, stress tests, and simulations, designed to strip you down to your instincts. This means, while you're reciting your polished ""I work well in a team"" speech, recruiters are watching how you respond to the trembling applicant beside you — aka your teammate. And, because they are attuned to in-flight behaviours, how you handle that anxious teammate is reflective of how you might react to a nervous passenger in flight.

# Our Mission

I persevered through nineteen rejections, not because I’m particularly resilient. Through them all, I had one thing that kept me going.

Just four weeks before my first interview, I took my first ever flight with Virgin Atlantic.

Fate had landed me aboard a ghost flight, where I had an entire cabin almost completely to myself. That meant I had three seats, three in-flight party bags, three pairs of socks, three eye masks, three mini tooth kits, three blankets, three pillows, and three shoe horns, all to myself — Naturally, I indulged and used them all.

Between blanket-swapping and eye-mask experimentation, I connected with the crew, who gave me a tour of the 747 — including the flight deck where they said something simple but life-changing: “You should apply.”

And just like that, I had something I didn’t have before: My first taste of belonging.

I clung to that moment like a life raft through every “no” that followed. Every time I got knocked down, that memory helped me stand back up, and it carried me all the way to the Golden Call.

I hope to be the encouragement that gets you all the way to yours.

We’re here to serve and support you on your journey.

I’m 33 years old Thai woman who’s been using dating apps (Bumble and Coffee Meets Bagel) on and off for over a year in Bangkok. My goal is to find a life partner, and I’m open to dating both locals and foreigners (men around 35-45). For this post, I’d like to focus on experiences with foreigners.

After getting back on the apps for about a month, I’ve started noticing some patterns. Many profiles in my dating pool have no bio at all or just 1-2 sentences that don’t really help me decide whether to swipe. I also see a lot of short-term visitors. Some people ask to meet up right away after just a couple of messages like “Hi” and “How are you?”, without really trying to get to know me first. I also did some experiment and found out that these people just want someone to talk to.

So I’m wondering:
1. Do foreigners who live in Thailand long-term and are genuinely looking for a serious relationship still use dating apps to find a partner?
2. Is this minimalist profile style a new trend, leaving most of the conversation to happen after matching?
3. Or is this more about a cultural difference in dating, where people prefer to get to know each other in person rather than through texting? (I’m not a big texter in early stages either, but I usually feel comfortable with 2–3 days of light conversation — not all day — just to get a sense of someone’s attitude before deciding to meet.)

I would love to hear your thoughts and experiences. Thanks in advance!",17,1750605981.0,Bangkok,26,0.8,False

Hitting snooze, scrolling through social media, skipping breakfast—it all seems harmless until you realize the whole day feels off. The truth is, **how you start your morning sets the tone for everything that follows**. But don’t worry. Creating a **productive morning routine** isn’t about waking up at 5 AM and running 10 miles. It’s about building habits that help *you* feel focused, calm, and ready to conquer the day.

In this blog, you’ll learn [how to create a productive morning routine that actually works](https://priya.growtoday.co.in/productive-morning-routine/)—one that you’ll enjoy and stick to.

#  Why Morning Routines Matter

Before we dive into the how, let’s quickly talk about the **why**.  
A good morning routine can:

* Boost productivity
* Reduce stress
* Improve mental clarity
* Build discipline
* Create a sense of purpose

Even better, starting your day intentionally can make your entire lifestyle more organized and fulfilling. Now, let’s get into the **step-by-step guide**.

#  Step 1: Wake Up at the Right Time for You

You don’t have to wake up at 5 AM to be successful. The key is to **wake up at a consistent time that suits your body and goals**. Whether it’s 6:30 AM or 8:00 AM, what matters is consistency.

**Tip:** Try to get 7–8 hours of sleep. No routine will work if you’re running on 3 hours of rest.

 *Pro Tip:* Avoid checking your phone first thing in the morning—it puts your brain in reactive mode instantly.

#  Step 2: Start With a Mini Refresh

Once you’re up, **do something simple to refresh your body and mind**. This can include:

* Washing your face
* Drinking a glass of water
* Doing light stretching
* Letting sunlight into your room

These tiny actions signal your brain that it’s time to switch from sleep to activity mode.

 *Bonus:* Keep a bottle of water next to your bed and drink it first thing—it rehydrates your body and boosts alertness.

#  Step 3: Practice Mindfulness or Gratitude

Now that you’re awake and refreshed, it’s time to tune in with yourself.

Choose **one of the following mindfulness habits**:

* Journaling (write 3 things you’re grateful for)
* 5–10 minutes of meditation or deep breathing
* Reading a page or two from an inspirational book
* Saying positive affirmations aloud

This sets a **positive emotional tone** for the day. And remember, even 5 minutes is enough to feel a shift.

#  Step 4: Plan Your Day Intentionally

Rather than jumping into work or chores, **take a few minutes to plan your priorities**.

Here’s how:

* Write down your top 3 goals for the day
* Check your calendar for upcoming tasks or calls
* List out quick to-dos in a notebook or app

This helps you feel in control—and eliminates morning panic.

 *Try this:* The “Eisenhower Matrix” (urgent vs. important) is a great method to decide what to focus on first.

#  Step 5: Get Your Body Moving

You don’t have to hit the gym for an hour—**even 10–15 minutes of movement** is enough to energize you. Options include:

* A brisk walk
* Yoga or stretching
* Quick at-home workout
* Dancing to a fun playlist

Physical activity not only wakes you up but also releases endorphins that improve your mood.

 *Pro Tip:* Create a 10-minute morning playlist you love—it makes movement more fun.

#  Step 6: Eat a Nourishing Breakfast

We’ve all heard it: “**Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.**” And guess what? It’s true—**especially if you want to stay energized and focused.**

Instead of skipping it or grabbing sugar-heavy snacks, aim for something simple yet nourishing like:

* Oats with fruits
* Eggs and toast
* Smoothie with greens and protein
* Yogurt with nuts

If you’re in a rush, **prep the night before**—overnight oats are a game changer!

#  Step 7: Start with a “Low-Pressure” Task

Now that you’re ready to dive into work, **don’t jump into the hardest task first**. Instead, start with a small, manageable activity like:

* Checking emails
* Organizing your desk
* Reviewing your to-do list

This warms up your brain and creates a sense of accomplishment, which makes tackling bigger tasks easier.

#  How to Stick to Your Routine

Starting a routine is easy. **Sticking to it? Not so much.** Here’s how to make it last:

* **Start small:** Don’t try to add 10 habits at once. Pick 2 or 3 and build slowly.
* **Make it enjoyable:** Choose activities you genuinely like—otherwise you won’t keep doing them.
* **Track your routine:** Use a habit tracker or journal to stay consistent.
* **Prepare the night before:** Set out your clothes, prep breakfast, and unplug early.
* **Stay flexible:** Life happens. If you miss a day or two, don’t quit—just restart.

#  What a Sample Morning Routine Looks Like

Here’s an example of a realistic 60-minute morning routine:

|Time|Activity|
|:-|:-|
|7:00 AM|Wake up + drink water|
|7:05 AM|Stretch or quick walk|
|7:20 AM|Meditation or gratitude journaling|
|7:30 AM|Shower + get ready|
|7:45 AM|Breakfast + coffee|
|8:00 AM|Plan your day + check emails|

Remember: **This is just a guide—adapt it to your life.**

#  Final Thoughts

Building a **productive morning routine that actually works** is not about copying someone else’s life. It’s about designing a flow that energizes *you*, supports your goals, and makes you feel good.

Start with small changes, stay consistent, and most importantly—**make mornings something to look forward to.** You’ll be surprised at how much your day (and life) improves.",2,1750605963.0,homefitness,0,1.0,False

1lhqhrc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDFamily/comments/1lhqhrc/how_to_deal_with_bpd_sister/,How to deal with BPD sister?,"TW: mentions of eating disorders.

I'm 21 years old and I've been dealing with my currently 28 year old sister for about five years ever since she left the psychiatric hospital. She's been through a lot of terrible trauma, but ever since she left the hospital I was assigned as her best friend by my parents as I'm closest to her in age, and my other sister is married and out of the house. I've been the victim of her antagonizing and demeaning comments for years, causing us to fight a lot, especially since I was a depressed, insecure teenager and refused to let her demean me. She used me to get out of the house countless times while I was underage to meet her hook-ups and stoner friends. She never seemed to feel any remorse for the things she's said and done to me, commenting on how I'm selfish despite her hyper-materialism and self-conceited nature, saying I want people to yell at me, that I'm ungrateful, that I can't feel anything. She's always been the one to start fights with me, just because the things I do and the way I behave are wrong to her. I'm the one who has always had to apologize. I've come to the conclusion that she projects a lot onto me. I don't wanna get deep into this as this would be far too long than it already is.

She's been unmedicated for over a year. But recently she's been pushing me to lose weight ever since I gained from trying to recover from ED. She gives me a lot of unsolicited advice and I try to avoid her for that reason. For context, I'm pretty much a hermit most of the time other than going to university consistently. She also still makes comments on my appearance.

Yesterday my sister came downstairs because she wanted to go to a coffee shop with me, and the first thing she does is take a picture of the back of my head and say that the way my hair looks from the back seems as if it's balding. I had already told her that I didn't want to go because I wanted to shower, but she kept asking so I said ok, it's only a drive-thru. She's done this before and I clearly displayed distaste for her bully-like behavior, yet she doesn't seem to care. I got quiet and said I didn't really wanna go out anymore. I was already feeling really terrible the past few days and on the brink of relapsing. I'm really tired of her behavior at this point so I kinda just shut down.

After my mother pushed me to go with her I came back home and went to my room. I didn't really talk to her even while we were out. I guess it's my fault I'm bad at communicating my feelings but she never listens to when I say I'm upset, makes it as if I'm always wrong, so I've given up. I really don't want to try anymore.

I hadn't eaten all day so I went to put lunch for myself as I found it wasn't worth starving over. She came into my room before I could eat and asked if I had ordered food. I said no and she changed her facial expression as if she were surprised. I hate it. Then she said I shouldn't eat on the bed. I had already relapsed not even an hour before so I got pissed and said that I wouldn't eat at all. Then she says that I'm really really fat and shouldn't eat. She smiled and left. I've told her before that I hate when she tells me that I've let myself go and that I used to be so beautiful before, because I was starving at the time and had trouble with food. Even then she didn't validate me and I had to leave the room. She wants to use my own ailments against me for whatever reason.

I didn't respond to this and left the house to take a walk. While on my walk she sends me messages saying that I'm inconsiderate, selfish (like she always does, she never elaborates), that my room is disgusting, that I ""finally"" have something to be rude to her for, even though I've many reasons. She mentioned that I should do something other than sit in front of my screen all day. Then she blocked me. I cried and came home and tried to ignore it.

She's been stuck in her room the past two days, yelling at everyone, pissy. She called my dad today and we could hear her crying and yelling in her room. I've been sitting outside of my room for once because if I'm alone I'll overthink everything and keep destroying myself. I've been ignoring her since resolving this like adults wouldn't work. Then today she sent me a message mocking me for leaving my room. I don't know why she's so deadset on harassing me like this when I didn't talk to her at all after what she said to me. I don't know if she wants my attention or what. Why is she the one pissed when she starts every fight? Why can't she just leave me alone?

She comes out of her room and I'm finally done with her behavior. I ask her why she's so dedicated on sending me these messages and then doesn't acknowledge me when she sees me physically. It's pathetic. I tell her to stop being scared and say these things straight to my face. She goes, I'm not scared, you're just jealous of me. She says I get happy when she's upset. Just straight up bullshit. She's the one who judges others for their appearances and behavior, not me. Why the fuck would I be jealous of her? Why is she sending me messages when she's the one who blocked me and said she has nothing else to say to me? When have I ever displayed joy towards the things that happen to her? I never belittle her for the things she feels. Jesus Christ.

I have never made comments on her appearance in my life, even when she gained weight from medication. I've never treated her as if she were stupid and given her advice non-stop. I've never told her that her sad feelings are invalid. She used to tell me that when she was my age she wouldn't even wash her clothes for months. She talked about her past self-destructive behavior. But when I can't take care of myself it's ""selfish"" and ""inconsiderate"". When I have self-destructive behavior it's ok to mock. I am trying so hard to improve, to follow my ambitions, start a business, anything. I even applied for an assistant job at my university. I'm working on my art so I can sell merchandise. She makes me feel like I'm a horrible human being who want's everything for herself, as if I'm the one who's money-hungry and buys designer bags. I even knocked on her door that she had locked, telling her I wanted to talk to her. She says she doesn't want to talk to me. 

How do I deal with this? She's seriously hurting me and victimizes herself. I don't know what to do. All she does is make me relapse and wish I was dead. I'm aware my depressed and hermit-like behavior is probably harming my family members, but I never try to make it anyone else's problem. I just keep to myself. I don't know what to do. Should I ask my parents to push her towards therapy again? Sorry for the long post.",1,1750605844.0,BPDFamily,0,1.0,False

It’s tucked away on over 8 acres with 450 feet of frontage on Revolver Lake. No motorboats, no noise. Just quiet water perfect for kayaking or sitting on the shore with a cup of coffee. It’s got vaulted ceilings, wood walls, and a cozy little wood stove that gives the whole place a warm, lived-in feel. The kind of place where you can fully unplug.

There’s something about a spot like this that makes you wonder what life would be like if you just... stayed. Would you wake up with the sunrise over the lake? Would winter actually feel peaceful instead of cold and loud? The property borders public forest too, so there’s no one behind you. Just trees and trails. No neighbors. No traffic. Just quiet.

Not everyone’s dream, but for the right person, this is it. Would you live here full-time or keep it as a weekend escape? Would you fish, write, chop wood, or just do nothing? I’m genuinely curious what people would do with a place like this.

I've been a big coffee person for around 5 years now and finally wanna upgrade from my Timemore C2 that I have been using since the start. I almost exclusively drink light roasts pour overs, so I have made up my mind about purchasing the ZP6. 

On the US website for 1zpresso,  it's currently priced at $209 USD, but I know someone traveling to Hong Kong and Bangkok in a few weeks, and I was wondering if it significantly cheaper to purchase there than here. If so, how big of a difference is it? Also, what is the best way to purchase it in either city? Which is better? 

I was looking at the coffee stage website for HK and the pricing looks mostly the same, but I am not sure. If it is indeed similar, I might not wait and just bite the bullet. I would greatly appreciate if someone can answer my question. ",1,1750605635.0,pourover,1,1.0,False

Fast forward a few years and our paths crossed again. We could have been 19 /20. We spent a lot of time together, i think she knew then i really fell for her, but she was just a tease and  nothing ever happened. This lasts a long time.. i eventually delete her number and cut her out. It hurt, but it’s the only way out.

I left the country and started a new life. (Haven’t left because of her, just circumstances). I don’t recall how we made contact again. Facebook came round maybe?

It turns out she’s also in the country i moved to.  She lives a couple of hours drive away. She came to visit with a female friend. Then we do a weekend away (nothing happened), then she visits again, we slept together. By this time i had tickets booked to go travelling for a year. We plan she comes to visit.. She never came, she met a rich guy.. i met somebody too and all is well, i’m in love with this new person, life is rosy.

I and this girl i met return to Europe, move in together.

I get an invite to the wedding of girl A. Luckily we were at a different wedding that weekend, so i had a good excuse not to go.

Another couple of years fwd, she makes contact again and invites me round. We go out for dinner, then back to her place. We talk on a sofa, then she takes me to their guest house. Nothing happened.

I got a text next day ‘i really wanted to kiss you’, i said something along the lines it’s too late for that now. After seeing their house i knew why she never wanted me, i simply could not provide this kind of lifestyle she’s having now and it all makes sense now. I think to myself what a superficial b***h.

I don’t think we’ve spoken for a long time after this meet.

Few years forward again and we meet. We go for dinner and drinks .. I’m starting to get confused, all those emotions are coming back. We meet again, dinner, drinks, she made the move and we’re kissing. Snd kissing for the rest of the night. We meet in the day time for lunches, coffees, i’m really starting to get into her. She suggests we book a spa break somewhere, but it never happens because she’s constantly busy with work. We keep meeting every now and again, i tell her how i feel, but she tells me she’s still in love with her husband.

Fast forward a few months and we book a hotel. Have amazing sex, then she gets up and goes home. We’ve done it a few times. We send each other naughty texts with pics, she’s all i have in my head. And then something happens, she stops messaging daily, pics stop, it’s all very cold. She blames work. Too busy to do anything.

Ok, i’m worried, and feel very sorry that i can’t help. I try suggesting dates when we can meet, ‘no, too busy, business trips, meetings’

I am gutted. The intervals between our evenings get longer. The chat isn’t improving. When we finally meet again, we have great sex, very intimate chat, she leaves and the whole thing repeats itself.

I don’t know what to do. I know the best thing would be to cut it all off again, concentrate on the relationship i’ve got and clear my head. It’s difficult. I know i’d be better off without all this. But it feels so good when we’re together. But it also hurts a lot when we’re not..

I’d love to know what is truly going through her head. What am i to her? Just a distraction from her everyday life?",0,1750605483.0,Infidelity,7,0.5,False

I accompanied a burnt out cousin na gustong magliwaliw kaya this is a sudden trip and medyo pricey yung airfare around 17k (vietnam airlines, including 23kg checkin luggage). I bought an eSim unlimited data via Klook na good for 4 days (P258).

For context, I'm a homebody. I'm a working man (I'm an elementary teacher who's still learning the job.) I go to work during the school year, help my parents with chores around the house, go to church, take care of my dog, and play video games. I guess I'm what you call a simple man and a homebody in that I'm not out doing wild things like going to bars (I don't drink) or going to parties. I'd rather be with my family on a Friday night than go out and do those types of things.

I work, and come home and just relax most days. (I'm on summer break right now, which has been nice. Trying to catch up on my bible reading.) Anyway, my point is, it's been hard to find women who would be content with someone like me. It feels like all the women I've seen on the apps want these extravagant dates and want to always travel and do super extensive activities for dates. 

I'd just like to be able to do more low-key dates, such as bible studies, coffee chats, romantic dinner dates, etc. It just feels like being myself isn't exciting enough... Maybe there are some women who feel the same way? My mom says that women just want to be loved and taken care of. I know she's right, it's just feeling difficult to find that kind of woman who just wants to settle down and eventually start a family. Thanks for reading.",2,1750605287.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False

I stared at my terminal like it betrayed me. All the WIP config changes, the local tweaks, vanished like they never existed.

* You switch machines mid-task, but your WIP changes are stashed.
* You’re pair programming, and your teammate needs a config tweak you stashed earlier.
* You want to save a temporary fix across setups without committing it.

Normally, that means:

* Copy-pasting files
* Slack DMs full of “Can you send me that snippet again?”
* Hacking through temporary branches",1,1750605251.0,u_heavendystopia,0,1.0,False

Not a demon. Just someone very good at being invisible. I’ve been inside their house for two weeks now. They don’t know who I am, but they feel me. They know something is wrong.

This is how I broke them. Night by night.

Night 1

I started small. The cords, every major appliance’s lifeline, cut clean and silent. The fridge. The washer and dryer. Chargers and blow dryers. All useless now, except for one: the TV.

Morning after night 1

Jack, the father, woke first. The silence in the kitchen was thick and wrong. He opened the fridge, expecting the familiar hum. Nothing. The cold was gone.

He checked the washer, the dryer, the dishwasher, all dead. The phone chargers didn’t work. The coffee machine was silent.

He exploded.

Lena, his wife, stumbled out of bed groggy and confused. Their kids, Jasper (16) and Avery (18), dragged themselves downstairs as Jack accused everyone in the room of tampering. His voice rose. The fear set in.

Lena called the police. They found nothing. No fingerprints. No signs of a break-in.

But the house had changed. It had begun.


Night 2

I opened every cabinet in the house, the kitchen, the bathrooms. Wide open, like some unseen breeze had swept through.

Then, at 2:37 a.m., I blasted The Conjuring on the living room TV. Full volume. Right at the scene where the terror begins.

They woke screaming. Jack ran for the source, yelling. Lena followed. Jasper stumbled out of his room in a panic, Avery sobbing behind him.

They looked at each other, each more afraid than the last.


Morning after Night 2

The cabinet doors remained open like mouths frozen mid-scream. Lena closed them all with shaking hands. Avery clung to her coffee cup. Jasper stayed silent, watching everyone too closely.

They whispered now. About ghosts. Intruders. Sleepwalking.

But no one said what they feared the most:
That someone was already inside.


Night 3

Jack barely slept. He paced the halls like a man being hunted.

Lena took a shower. I stole her towel, left it folded neatly beneath the bed.

Avery sat cross-legged in her room, headphones on, music too loud,  trying to drown it out. Jasper was in his closet again. He’d started sleeping there.

Jack sat in front of the TV, half-watching. I stood beside him, masked, invisible, breathing quietly.

He felt me. He froze.

I leaned close and whispered:

“Do you miss the control?”

He spun, nothing there. His face was pale, sweating.

I giggled in the dark, brushing his arm, then circled to the other side.

This time, I screamed into his ear:

“DO YOU MISS THE CONTROL?!”

He screamed too, not at me, at the space around him. He was losing.

And I hadn't even touched him.


Nights 4–11

Nothing happened.

No noise. No movement. Just silence.

But no one slept. No one smiled. The house held its breath. Shadows grew long and heavier. Every creak was a threat. Every glance over the shoulder, a panic.

They waited. They didn’t know what for.

But I was there. Watching.


Night 12

Dinner was a battlefield. Lena spilled her wine, just a gentle tap from me at her elbow. She cursed herself quietly.

The chicken burned, left too long at 250°, my doing.

Whispers started again. Too much wine. Forgetful. Losing it.

She said nothing. Just stared, hollow.


Night 13

Nothing happened.

No sounds. No flickering lights. No whispering voice.

But no one believed the silence anymore.

Lena poured wine but didn’t drink. Jack stood by the window for hours, convinced I’d come through it. Avery hadn’t spoken all day. Jasper double-locked his door and checked it ten times before bed.

Their nerves were raw.

I didn’t need to move.
They were already unraveling.


Night 14: Two Weeks of Hell

They thought it was over. They were wrong.

Dinner was tense. Jack shouted. Avery and Jasper sat silent, eyes wide with dread.

Afterward, orders were barked: lock the doors, shut the windows, nobody leaves their room.

That’s when I laced every drink and dish with laxatives. The torment was slow, humiliating, inescapable.

By 1 a.m., Jack was doubled over in pain. Then Jasper. Then Lena and Avery. Two bathrooms. Four people. Four endless hours.

While they suffered, I collected their smartwatches and reset them:

Jack: 156 days in the future.

Lena: 50 years ahead.

Avery: 18 years from now.

Jasper: 67 years out.


Each watch stopped, permanently, at 3:47 a.m.

At the exact moment they collapsed into uneasy sleep, the TV flickered on. It looped one line from a medical drama, over and over:

“Time of death. Time of death. Time of death.”

Morning came 

They rose like ghosts themselves, pale, quiet, raw.

Jack sat on the couch, still sweating. Jasper and Avery wandered in from the hallway, dazed. Lena hovered by the kitchen doorway, eyes sunken.

Then Avery looked at her watch.
So did Jasper.
Then Lena.
Then Jack.

Each one stared. The dates were wrong. Far into the future. All different.

“What is this?” Lena whispered.

Jasper shook his head. Avery looked at her father, frightened.

Jack stood abruptly. “I need coffee.”

He walked to the fridge, flung it open.

The color drained from his face.

Inside were four containers, neatly stacked, each labeled with one of their names:

Jack: a raw pig’s heart.

Lena: a bag of chemo medicine.

Avery: a syringe.

Jasper: a gun.


The others crowded behind him, silent.

No one spoke.

No one had to.


The watches marked when they’ll die.
The containers showed how.

I didn’t kill them.
I just showed them how it ends",4,1750605087.0,horrorstories,1,1.0,False

1lhq44r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IzzatQQDir/comments/1lhq44r/chapter_1_welcome_to_the_project/,Chapter 1 : Welcome to The Project,"Muse woke up with a dry throat and a throbbing head. Not pain exactly - more like a fog had settled inside his skull. A strange warmth clung to his eyes, making it hard to see. The room was a blur of light and soft shapes.

As his vision adjusted, things sharpened into place.

The room was quiet.

Then he noticed the girl.

She was lying on his sofa, curled on her side. Her hands were restrained with a ribbon - tied deliberately, palms together, like a present someone didn’t want to open.

Muse blinked.

“What...?” he muttered. “Who is this?”

He looked around.

The apartment was locked. Windows shut. No sign of a break-in. Everything looked exactly the same as it always did. Nothing disturbed - except her.

Then she moved.

Muse tensed. She was waking up. And no matter how he sliced it, this looked bad for him.

“Good morning,” she said softly, already sitting up. Her hands were still bound. “I guess I just fell asleep like that.”

Muse stared at her in silence.

“Would you please untie me?”

He obeyed without a word.

“Can I borrow your toilet for a bit?”

He nodded.

She stood carefully, adjusted her skirt, and walked toward the bathroom like she knew the place. Like she belonged here.

A few minutes later, she returned. Her bangs were slightly damp - she’d washed her face.

The silence stretched, heavy with questions. Muse finally spoke.

“D-Did I let you in?”

She looked at him with a pout. “Eh? Don’t tell me you don’t remember me. Especially after everything that happened between us.”

Muse’s brow twitched. She was gorgeous - long black hair, pale skin, and striking blue eyes. A mix of elegance and danger. His heart was racing, but his mind felt like a static screen.

“Wh-What exactly happened between us?” he asked, trying not to stare too long.

“Try to guess,” she teased. Her tone was playful, but something unreadable lurked beneath it. Had she noticed his reaction? Was she messing with him? Or… did something really happen?

“We both... slept?” he guessed, face flushing.

“Yeah, we did.” Her smile deepened. “But you really don’t remember me?”

“No,” he admitted. “I don’t think so.”

“I see,” she said, eyes lowering. “Then I guess we’re strangers again, huh?”

She stepped closer and held out her hand.

“My name is Mesmer. Pleased to meet you—again.”

“Again?” Muse didn’t shake her hand.

She gave him a look—serious now. “What I’m about to say might sound unbelievable. But promise you’ll believe me.”

Muse hesitated. “Sure.” He said it mostly to keep things calm. The last thing he needed was to end up in a courtroom sketch.

Mesmer took a breath.

“You’re already dead,” she said. “But we managed to keep your brain alive using a device called the Adaptive Brain Interface - ABI for short. You’ve only been awake, fully functional, for about two weeks.”

Her words echoed in Muse’s head. Blurry images flashed behind his eyes, as if his brain were searching for something - anything - to contradict what she’d just said. But it was useless. He couldn’t remember.
All he had was the unshakable conviction that he was still here. Alive.

“What the hell are you talking about?” he blurted out.

“I know. It’s hard to believe,” Mesmer said, her voice soft, almost rehearsed. “We’ve already had this conversation before.”

She reached for his hands, slipping her fingers between his and gently pulling herself closer.

“Your hands are warm. I can feel your breath. Your heartbeat. Tell me - how are you dead, if your body’s still working and your consciousness is still here?”

Their eyes met. There was a strange glint in hers - something like longing, or relief. Muse looked away, uncomfortable. He could feel her touch. Too real to be imagined.

“Isn’t that just because I’m actually alive?” he asked, brow furrowing.

“Yes, exactly! That’s what I’m saying,” she beamed. “You’re the first human we’ve successfully brought back to life. Proof that miracles exist.”

She leaned back, settling into a more casual posture. Muse didn’t know how to respond.

“That sounds like a heavy role,” he muttered. “You sound like a muse.”

“You mean, an artistic woman?” She smirked. “Yeah, I suppose. Incidentally, that’s your name. Muse. Do you remember?”

“I think so. I kind of… knew it already.”

“Good. We’re still monitoring your neural recovery. Resurrection is complicated.” She reached for a sleek, black device - something between headphones and a crown—and held it out.
“Here. Put this on.”

“What is it?” Muse asked, inspecting the strange tech.

“Audiotherapy. It plays a frequency that helps recover your memory. Like jump-starting the mind.”

“And how does that work?”

Mesmer’s eyes lit up.

“Well... have you ever heard of Schumann’s Resonance?”

She balled her fists excitedly, like she couldn’t wait to explain.

“No. I’m dumb.”

“You’re not dumb.” Her tone was oddly genuine. “Schumann’s Resonance is a frequency the Earth emits. A researcher found that certain frequencies align with brainwave patterns. Basically, we discovered that some frequencies can mimic brainwaves - and influence how the brain fires.”

Muse blinked.

“I kind of get it. But also not.”

“That’s okay,” she said, nodding quickly. “To summarize: we figured out how to encode memories as frequencies. That device can replay them directly into your neural pathways. Like a flash of your life… compressed, super fast.”

“That’s… wow.” Muse studied her, unsure. She’s either a genius or completely insane, he thought.
Still, what harm could it do to play along?

“I’ll wait,” Mesmer said gently. “Go ahead. Do your thing.”

Muse mulled it over. A headphone that can return your memories - it felt like something out of cheap sci-fi. But he wanted answers. Who was he, really? Could she actually be telling the truth?

Regaining his composure, Muse put it on. Nothing. No music or noise. Just silence.
“Hey, is there something wrong with this?”

“Yeah, put your hand on the right bud. It’ll work.”

“Like this?” Muse touched it with his palm.

Suddenly, a strong buzzing.
Boom. His mind went blank.

Flashes filled his head - overwhelming, dreamlike images that vanished as quickly as they came.

And then - nothing.

He couldn’t tell how long he’d been gone. A second? An hour? But suddenly, it was there. He remembered everything. What his life was. Who she was. Who he was.

“Welcome back, Muse.” She looked at him with a soft expression.

“Hey there, Mesmer. Sorry about that.” His tone changed. For the first time since morning, he felt in control.
“About last night... I mean.”

“Oh, it’s okay. I’m basically your assistant. It’s normal for me to take care of you.”

“Still - I shouldn’t have put you through all that. I feel like I lost my mind yesterday.” Guilt crept into his voice.

“It’s okay. Everything works out. I’m used to taking care of people. I live with a family of four. Granted, they’re usually not so out of touch with reality - but hey, new experiences.”

“Why does that happen, anyway?”

“Well, if you must know - my hypothesis is that when your ABI runs low on charge, you start to lose your filter. The one that keeps your imagination from bleeding into reality. So you hallucinate. You see and hear things that aren’t there.”

“Like I was drugged?”

“Not quite. I’d call it a lucid hallucinatory state - maybe close to schizophrenia, but more in control. You’re still aware. Just… stripped of inhibition. As the ABI dies, your mental barriers weaken. You start reverting. Acting younger. More impulsive.”

“Like a child.”

“Exactly.”

“So the reason I tied you up was because I was afraid you might draw on my face while I was sleeping. And that I was scared of sleeping alone.”

“Yes. You were really cute that way,” Mesmer said - maybe a little too honestly.

“Shut up,” he mumbled, embarrassed.

Realizing the time, he got up and told Mesmer to head home.

“Oh yeah, sure. I have to be early today. But since I’m already here - maybe we can have some breakfast? Or are you not the type to eat in the morning?”

“Sometimes, I guess. Cooking is a pain,” he replied hesitantly. “But you should eat. Don’t mind me.”

“Like I said, I’m offering to cook. Would you like some?”

“Why not? But is it okay with you? You should at least call your parents. You weren’t home last night.”

“I will. Go shower.”

“I’m not sure what ingredients I have, but I’m sure you can figure it out.”
And with that, he stepped into the shower.

Steam wafted from the cracked bathroom door. Muse never liked brisk showers. He needed the time - and the excuse - to stay out of Mesmer’s way.

A warm aroma crept through the apartment. A home-cooked meal was a luxury he never thought he’d miss. The scent stirred something - his mother, maybe. A faded warmth he couldn't quite picture anymore. Maybe he lacked imagination. Or maybe it had just been too long since he’d seen her - alive.

“Smells good. Is this how your house usually smells, or do you just live off takeout?” Muse called out with a weak grin.

“Well, I usually wake up with my hands tied, so I don’t get the chance to cook,” Mesmer answered with dry sarcasm.

“Ugh, just forget about that, please.”

Mesmer smirked - or whatever expression people make when they’re clearly enjoying your embarrassment. She was a sly one, Muse thought. The kind who’d tease him about this for the rest of his life. But for what it was worth, the idea amused him.

After getting dressed, he helped her set plates on the counter.

“Some coffee would be nice,” Muse sighed.

“That’s still illegal, you know.”

“What’s the harm though?” he muttered. “It’s just a bit of caffeine.”

Mesmer’s expression shifted-more serious now. “I know you were born in the old world, but ever since you got the ABI installed, caffeine can mess with you. Your implant doesn't just enhance your brain-it controls it. Heartbeat, breath, hormones. Everything. Other people can survive if their ABI fails. You can’t.”

“So what, I keel over if I take a sip?”

“As a stimulant, caffeine can heighten anxiety, sure. But with ABI manipulating your neurochemistry in real time, even small triggers can be amplified a hundredfold. Irrational thoughts, panic attacks - if your ABI interprets the wrong signal, it could start overriding your systems in unpredictable ways.”

Muse blinked, then slumped. “You talk too much.”

“You asked.”

“You’re right. I’m sorry.”

“As long as you get it.”

“You sound smart for someone still living with their parents,” he said, trying to regain the upper hand.

“Says the one who has to be babysat like a child,” she shot back.

“Ugh. I told you to forget about that.” He rubbed his forehead.

“Well,” she said with a soft shrug, “I don’t really mind.”

Silence filled the room - but it wasn’t awkward. It hung there, warm. Comfortable.

Then, Muse suddenly spoke.

“Hey… do you think it’s unfair? That I still age normally?”

Mesmer looked surprised. Maybe it was the bluntness. Maybe she hadn’t expected him to ask that.

“I... I don’t know. It’s just… how things are. Evolution, or entropy, or the universe being cruel. I’ll be lucky to make it to 40. You? You could live to 80. Even 100. Because you were born in the old world.”

Muse’s eyes lowered. “And why am I a miracle again?”

“Because you’re proof we don’t have to die so young. That if we can keep a brain alive, we can keep someone alive.”

“So that’s it?”

“You’re more than that. You’re proof that hope still exists.” She hesitated, then added: “You are a miracle in flesh.”

Honestly, Muse didn’t feel like a miracle. But it would be selfish to tell her that.

1lhq0ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1lhq0ya/she_was_way_too_young/,She was way too young.,"We were on our usual morning walk when a man who was standing in front of a flower bed stopped me and commented on the amount of bees there were in the flowers and how happy he was to see them.  I notice there were dozens of them, and they were flying about.  I'm not much of a small talk person and wanted to leave, but I allowed him to discuss bees for 10 minutes or so before I went on my way.

My girl (**Poppy, Olde English Bulldogge, 4**) stopped at a coffee shop and she was quite a bit less stubborn, less defiant, and her hand-signal obedience was top tier this morning.  We finished up our walk and headed home.  Poppy sprawled out on the floor as she usually does and I went into my office to work.

I stopped work around 5pm or so and did a few things around the place.  Usually Poppy starts perking up around 6pm or so and usually wants to start heading out for evening play, but she didn't.  So, I decided to take a nap.  I woke up around 7:15 and felt it very unusual that Poppy had not started trying to get me out, so I check on her and she is sitting on her bed looking around and lightly panting.  I knew something was unusual, but I decided to turn on the A/C then start getting her ready to go out.

She relieved herself fine, no issues.  We began our walk, and she halted in place and refused to me.  I tried to encourage her, knowing she's quite a bit stubborn, but she fought me harder than she's ever had before.  Huh.  She must really not want to walk.  Ok, you win.  We start heading back home and she found a patch of grass and decided to lay down.  She sprawled out on the grass, put her head down, and just laid there for a while.

After about 25 minutes I started encouraging her to come inside, she refused.  She has a little bit of anxiety so I left, and she will follow.  She didn't this time, I looked back and she was standing staring at me in my direction.  I decided to go back and get her started on going back inside and she agreed finally.

She laid down on her shag rug and sprawled out.  I put her food out, she ignored it.  I gave her a high-value snack that she's never denied, and she spit it out.  Something was wrong.  **I knew if I sent her to the emergency vet I would be spending a fortune.  I called the telehealth vet.** 

We went through a list of questions ""Is she breathing heavily?"" No.  ""Did she have diarrhea?"" No.  ""Does she feel hot?"" I touch her, not more than  usual, no. ""So, she's lethargic and not eating?"" Correct. This is unusual behavior. ""Is she drinking?"" Yes, she's drinking.  I placed water next to her and she drank it. 

""If she's not eating, it's a big deal, and bulldogs often suffer from endocrine issues that contribute to the lethargy.  Monitor her over night and take her to her usual vet in the morning for blood work"".  Sure thing.

I went to bed, she followed me, she jumped on my bed and laid on my chest until she got too uncomfortable and then I kicked her off.  She immediately plopped down and went to sleep.  

The next morning I a woke and Poppy was not in my bed. ""Poppy!"", I called.  She didn't come.  I immediately got out of bed and once again I found her in her bed in a separate room and she is sitting down, lightly panting, and looking around.  Shit.  I quickly showered, put on my clothes, and we headed out the door to the vet.  I dropped her off and went on my way.

The vet called me and said she's suffering from an anaphylaxis and has accumulated a lot of fluid and her heart and abdomen. **X-rays show that she also has an enlarged heart, and underlying issue previously unknown**. The doctor said she wanted to immediately drain the fluid from her heart and I agreed.  We hung up the call and she called me back 15 minutes later and said that she wanted me to pick up Poppy and transfer her to the emergency vet because there will be a team ready to assist her in the event something happens during the draining, so they did not drain her.

I picked her up, and she was... bloated, extremely bloated.  The stress from the vet caused more damage? She wasn't like this before.  She was limp, presumably from the Benadryl, anti-inflammatory, and sedatives (I think).  I drove her to the emergency vet and let her sit in the front seat (Something I never do, but she wants).  She sat as my sidekick as I massaged her limp body while she rested, eyes wandering towards me and other visuals.  I told her that she's a bulldog and bulldog's are strong, so she'll recover from this.

When we arrived at the emergency vet, they had a team with a gurney ready to assist.  Five people total, one of them pulled me to the side and immediately began asking me questions while they took her away. I did not get to say my goodbye.  They placed me into a room, and 10 minutes later the vet came in.

The vet said she's doing okay, but her blood pressure is low and she fears draining her heart could worsen her situation because of low clotting abilities.  The vet said she would like to do a plasma transfusion to bring blood pressure back up and stabilize her, and in this event it is likely that she will be able to absorb the remaining fluid and return to health.  She suggested she stay overnight for two nights, possibly more, and I agreed with all of this. **I asked if the previous vet had sent the x-rays over.  The internet in my city was down that entire day because someone sabotaged the lines**. They did not receive the x-rays but said they communicated with the other office to make sure they understood what the problems were.  She said that I could leave and that she will call me with updates.  In this moment I was debating asking if I could see her one more time, but the conversation had an aura of confidence and we both felt as if she was fine.

I was on my way home, when I got a call 10 minutes later. The vet was calm and said that they were stabilizing Poppy and during the plasma transfusion Poppy went into cardiac arrest and her heart stopped.  She asked if I would like for them to continue doing chest compression.  Uhh, yes?  I'll be on my way.  I rushed over.

I sped into the parking lot and ran inside. The lobby was empty, they placed me into a room and the doctor came in shortly.  The doctor reiterated what she said over the phone, and after she went into cardiac arrest they had decided to drain her heart to see if they could recover her.  They were unable to.  I told them they can stop doing chest compressions.

They brought my baby girl in and I collapsed.  I screamed. I cried. I didn't understand. I still don't.  After sometime, I left the the room to get water and the lobby was full of people and all of them were staring at me.

I returned to say goodbye to my dear Poppy and I left.  It's been four days.  I keep breaking down. How could I have been so naive?  Why didn't I just bring her in the evening before?  Why did I attribute her requiring so much rest during walks as just general bulldog stubbornness?  Why did I miss all these signs?  It is like I am watching the big reveal at the end of a movie and it changed the context over the entire plot and now I have a different perspective.  Everything made sense now.  Why didn't I see it?

I would give a limb to just go back to that one day and take her in early. The guy stopping me in front of the swarming bees for 10 minutes. The telehealth vet suggesting to just keep an eye on her.  The internet being down and the vets weren't able to properly communicate with each other.  Her heart issues over the coming months that I just chalked up as stubbornness, humid weather, and her just wanting to do the things she wants.  All of it seemed orchestrated to take my Poppybear away from me.

These little furballs rely on us to see things and know things that they can't tell us, and when we cannot properly do that, we fail them.  It is for this reason I feel like I failed her as a pet parent, despite everyone assuring me that I've been a perfect dog dad, and everyone knows it, and how obvious it was how good I was to her.  

The guilt is eating me up.  I just don't know how to move on from this.  I don't know how it's not my fault. My entire world has flipped upside down.  Rest in peace, my sweet Poppy.  You didn't deserve to be taken so soon.  I'm so sorry.

I think that's a major thing holding me back from socializing or even going to the coffee store: if even a mild thing doesn't go right, if the cashier or customer has an attitude, I mispronounce a menu item, whatever, it will ruin my day, maybe my week because I'll keep ruminating on it.

Is there a way to let things like this go?  Anyone who's dealt with this and found something that worked?

Also, am I being a doormat if I don't somehow respond to rude people, or is it truly best to just ignore them?  I think that's the main theme of the ruminations: I'm not mad at them for being rude--im mad at myself because I'm not sure if I handled it sufficiently.  ",1,1750604344.0,socialskills,2,1.0,False

Yeah, this is going to sound pretty damn crazy, I don’t expect you to believe me, just stick with it. BUT there is something else living in my house and it is NOT human. 

We moved into a new housing estate just outside a small city in the UK. The first few nights were fine, we unpacked, redecorated, got settled.

Then the weird stuff started.

 We would be watching TV in the living room and hear a crash from the kitchen. I would run in to find a plate smashed all over the floor. Every time I shrugged it off, it must have been on the edge of the table, it just fell off the drying rack. All of my conclusions were rational

The next night, it was a cup, then a fork. Sometimes we wouldn’t even hear it. It would just be laying on the floor when me or my girlfriend got home from work. 

She was getting freaked out by all of this and was going to stay with her parents for a couple of nights. I just said she was being silly, there must have been a rational explanation, right? 

Yeah, that didn’t really go too well for me…

 I stayed in the house and began to hear other things, like the doors upstairs opening and slamming shut. I had dismissed a lot of the things over the last week, but the other night? That had me locked in my bedroom, wide awake till morning. 

That night, I didn’t my usual checks, doors locked, windows shut, everything switched off.  As I turned off the last light in the hallway, I had the fight or flight feeling. 
The same one I’ve had since I was a kid.
That urge to bolt up the stairs like something’s chasing me.

Halfway up the stairs I heard another set of fast paced footsteps from behind me. 
My skin went prickly.
 I repeated to myself, it’s all in your head, it’s all in your head. 
Then I did something I would never do.
I looked back.

Something was moving, all I could see were eyes reflecting off the upstairs light. 
They were wide and bloodshot. 
I couldn’t see anything else just a dark figure, and those cursed eyes. 

I shouted out. 

“What the hell?! Shit! Shit!’ 

I stumbled to the top step and then, silence. 

The whole house quiet. 

I rushed into the bedroom, turned the light on and put the TV up to full volume. 

That’s where I stayed, freaked out and on edge. 
Once it was light outside, it made the house feel a lot less threatening.

 I went downstairs. The cupboards were all open so was the fridge… and oven. 

This was too much, I wasn’t going to stay here alone again.

I called my brother Dan to see if he wanted to stay here for a few nights. I didn’t say my reasons because It would have sounded like I was scared. He said it would be a good idea and we could get some drinks in. 

Last night we had a good evening playing the PlayStation and drinking beers. Only hearing the odd bump or creak. We were getting pretty drunk by the time we decided to call it a night. I then told him what had happened the night before. 
He laughed at me, and called me a pussy. 
I laughed it off. 

He headed into the spare room I had made up earlier. I went up after, I had that same urge to run, but I didn’t. I walked, all the way to the top. Nothing happened. Was it in my head?

About 3 AM, I was woken up by a large bang downstairs. 

Someone then started to call my name, it was my girlfriend. 

What was she doing here?

 She hadn’t come upstairs, which was weird.
I text her: ‘Are you coming to bed? Be quiet, Dan’s asleep in the spare room x’

She texted back: ‘What are you talking about, I’m at my parents?’

She had to be messing with me, she knew how paranoid I’d been lately.

I sat up in bed, frozen, just listening. The voice, her voice, called out again. It was clearer this time.

“Babe?” She was almost laughing.

I got up, quietly. 
I didn’t want to wake Dan, or get him involved. I stepped into the hallway, the floor was ice cold under my feet, every creak of the boards echoed in the silence.

I peered down the staircase. The hallway light was still off. It was pitch black down there. 
But I thought I saw…movement.

I leaned my head out. Just enough. Squinting in concentration, holding my breath.

Then the darkness shifted. I didn’t hear anything move, but I knew it had.

A face, or something was now just barely visible. Right at the bottom of the stairs. 
Watching me. Still. Silent.

It tilted, just a fraction. Like it was curious, or amused.

I pointed my phone straight down the stairs and took a photo. The flash illuminated the staircase. I saw the two bloodshot eyes glisten from the bottom.
Then it launched up towards me. 

I sprinted into my bedroom and slammed the door shut, locking it tight. The banging started immediately, like fists slamming against the wood. The handle rattled violently.
Then…it stopped.
No footsteps. No noise. Just silence.

I sat exhausted on the bed, my heart pounding. 

Two knocks on the door then broke the silence. 

“Babe? Are you going to let me in?”

I shouted back “Leave me alone! You’re not her!”

The voice calmly answered back “What’s wrong babe? Just let me in the bedroom, please.”

“Just go away!” I yelled out.

I’d had enough, I grabbed my phone and called my girlfriend. 

She answered after the second time of trying.

“Hello, hello? Where are you?” I asked her.

She sounded half asleep in her response, “At my parents, you know this, I was asleep.”

“Shit.” I whispered through clenched teeth.

“What’s the matter with you? You sound out of breath?” She asked now with more alertness.

“Don’t worry, I will come over in the morning and explain, sorry for waking you up”.

I didn’t want to worry her, even I thought I was going crazy, didn’t want to drag her into it. 

She sighed. “Okay, can I go back to sleep now?”

I hung up the phone. 

I just couldn’t process any of this. 

Slow footsteps then walked away from my door, and down the stairs. 

I stayed in my bedroom, wide awake again, until the sun glared through my curtains. 

This morning, everything felt…strange. I hadn’t slept. I unlocked the door and went over to the spare room where Dan was staying. I knocked on the door.

“You up, mate?” I whispered.

No answer.

“Mate?” I said slightly louder while I pushed the door open.

The bed was neatly made. Untouched.

The room was exactly how I’d left it before he arrived.  

Duvet still tucked in. 
Pillow still smooth.
His night bag? Gone.

I stood there, frozen. Just thinking, what the hell’s going on?

I checked the bathroom, then every room in the house. Nothing. No jacket. No shoes. No sign he’d even been here.

Maybe he’d left in the night for some reason?Were the footsteps I heard his? 
But Dan would never just leave without saying something.

I kept checking the front door, hoping he had just popped out, I knew he liked to run in the mornings.

Around noon I gave up and called home.

“Hey,” I said, trying to sound casual, “is Dan back yet?”

My mum sounded confused.

“Back? From where?”

“From mine, he stayed here last night?”

There was a long pause.

“Erm… Dan’s been here all weekend. He’s in his room now.”

“No, he, What? I picked him up. We played PlayStation. We drank Budweiser!”

“Calm down, you must’ve dreamt it, love. He didn’t go anywhere, did you want to speak to him?”

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t.

I sat there, the phone still pressed to my ear, staring at the front door.

“Sorry mum, no, it’s okay, I must have just had a vivid dream or something, I’ll speak to you later, okay?”

“Okay love, love you, bye”

“Love you too, bye”.

I looked around my living room, the empty  beer bottles still on the coffee table.

I was just about to call my girlfriend when I heard a voice coming from upstairs.

“Mate, you downstairs?”

It was Dan. I jumped up and walked out the room. 

“Dan?” I called from the bottom of the stairs.

“Yeah, come up here mate!”

My stomach dropped.

“Okay mate, coming now!” I shouted back.

I grabbed my keys, ran out the front door.
As I reached my car, I looked back up to the upstairs window.

Through the blinds, two red eyes stared back at me. 

I couldn’t have got into my car any quicker. 

That was it. I was not going back to that house again. 

I am currently staying with my girlfriend’s parents. 

I have spoken to Dan, my mum was right. 
I never called him. 
He never came to mine. 
He never stayed over. 

I’ve been reading online… Something about a Jinn or skinwalker? Anyone know what these are?

One post said if you ever ‘acknowledge’ it, it can mimic people you know or loved ones, is that true?

We are now considering putting the house back up for sale. 

If you have any suggestions on what we can do to get rid of it or anything to help, please reach out.

This was supposed to be our forever home, but now it has turned into a living nightmare. 

This sounds stupid but, because I looked back that night, while I thought I was being chased up the stairs. 
Did I acknowledge it somehow? 
Did I expose it, and now it knows I can see and hear it. 

I haven’t slept more than an hour since.

You know that photo I took at the top of the stairs, yeah? I caught it. It isn’t much, but it’s on my screen right now.

I’d post it, but… I’m not sure if I can on here.

I do have anxiety and OCD. But for the past year I've been managing it well, and my mental health has been better overall. Part of me feels like I'm overreacting because I have anxiety. But honestly I think I'm being reasonable. The U.S. (where I live) is absolutely fucked up, and people are not supposed to live like this.

I just recently moved into an apartment with my partner. I'm very happy with them, and I'm so grateful we get to live together. But the responsibilities that come with being an adult are paralyzing sometimes. I moved to a new state to live with them. I'm a full time student (online), but I've been trying to find a job since I have rent and bills. Barely anybody is hiring. I haven't heard back from any places I've applied. Even coffee shops won't contact their applicants. The economy is shit. My partner works 40+ hours a week but doesn't make nearly enough to live the way people should be able to. Groceries are disgustingly expensive. We looked into food stamps, then missed our application appointment because they sent us an appointment reminder in the mail AFTER the date of the appointment. Next month I'll be getting my bachelor's degree, but even with a degree, jobs pay like shit (if they even call me back). Since I'm in a new state I think I have to get new car insurance, new car registration, new plates. At least I'm pretty sure I do, nobody ever taught me any of this. All this shit I don't know how to do and can't afford. Being an adult is so stressful and I don't know how to handle it. Everyone I've talked to says ""well that's just life, welcome to the club."" and it makes me feel minimized and hopeless. Life. Shouldn't. Be. Like. This. Everything is so difficult to handle. Any ""assistance"" offered by the government is not nearly enough help, and the system is impossible to navigate. People shouldn't live like this. The U.S. really just wants to keep its citizens poor and misserable. Oh, and World War 3 is on the way. No wonder there's a mental health crisis in the U.S. and suicide rates are so high. 

I'm trying to be positive and I'm trying to handle everything but it's too much. I feel overwhelmed and paralyzed and I feel like crying every single day. ",1,1750604103.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

so i asked my work lead if they can do it at 12, and he said: no, we will not replace it. u should wake up early. 

like what the hell? i feel like a night owl is not respected. a collegauge of me is also in the same boat. i see him some times arriving 30 minutes late and he seems to me like he just arise from his grave. 

i really treid to shift my sleep schedule to go to bed early and wake up early, but i literally got sick of it! i have not felt so bad in a long long time.

so in the sunday i try to go to bed early on, but i am just on my bed staring at my room, not falling asleep. so normaly i just go to bed at 2 in the night and then wake up at 7. 

so then i wake up at 7. force my self out of bed. then i need a lot of coffee to get my brains started. then i need some time to wakeup. then i take the bike and off i go to my work. i arrive and i am very very tired. i smoke a cig take more coffee, and then the meeting starts. i am barly present with my mind at the meeting. then afther that more coffee/ and if i am lucky i start to wake up in a few hours at least or even a entire day. 

and then  the weeked.... nice long nights, good sleep, waking up when i want to wake up.

***For the week of June 16 ­– June 22***

[Hege Merch Store logo.](https://preview.redd.it/xzc9pa44qh8f1.png?width=1780&format=png&auto=webp&s=b29a1c380983700aec07c27be29331b2151e1426)

Hello Hegends! It’s time for another weekly update from your favorite team. This week again, markets have been on the edge of their seats trying to make sense of what's happening in the Middle East. Lots of uncertainty. Lots of fear. On our end, we try to ignore all of that most of the time, because it’s way beyond our power to control. Instead, we put all our focus on building and delivering. And this week, delivered we have!

Let’s dive in.

# Market update

We’ll start with the usual market update.

Of course the big thing this week again has been the escalating attacks between Israel and Iran. And this morning we learned that the US has now entered the conflict as well. The added uncertainty and fear has caused the markets to sell off across the board, with the altcoin market being hit especially hard.

We’re not going to try to predict what will happen next or how long this will drag on for. The geopolitical machinations at play here are way beyond our humble hedgehog brains to comprehend. It could blow over fast, it could drag on. We’ll just have to sit tight and see.

While all eyes have been on the Middle East, a few positive things of note have happened during the week as well.

On Tuesday, June 17, with support from both parties, the US Senate passed their GENIUS Act. Passing this bill moves the US one step closer to a solid regulation of stablecoins, and it’s a big win for crypto. It now has to be passed by the House to go into law. There has been some pushback about the bill not offering enough protection against corruption. But Trump is pushing for it to get passed, and meanwhile Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has been out bullposting about stablecoins on X. It seems likely it will be passed within the coming months.

On Wednesday, the US Fed decided to keep the interest rate unchanged. This was expected by the markets, and did not have much of an impact. Chairman Powell is warning that Trump’s tariffs will increase inflation in the coming months. This makes them want to avoid cutting rates too soon. Nonetheless, they still project two rate cuts this year, as before. All in all, what the Fed does right now has little impact on the markets, compared to everything else that’s going on.

Meanwhile, inflows to the bitcoin and ethereum ETFs continue to be strong. In addition, Strategy bagged another $1 billion worth of BTC, and it seems almost every day there is some news about other companies announcing their own plans to either start buying crypto or to buy more of it. Companies buying crypto is clearly becoming one of the key narratives this cycle. In our view, this is very bullish.

It’s been 49 days since I walked away from the cryptoverse sold all my SOL, XRP, and ASSDA (ADA for you masochists still holding).

Since then, I’ve witnessed a beautiful unraveling:

Bags are down another 30%.

Projects are now partnering with AI-generated influencers named “MetaLuna69.”

People are unironically saying, “If WW3 kicks off, Bitcoin might finally moon.” “Nows a good time to buy” 

I saw a grown man on Twitter Spaces whisper “alt season is coming” like it was a prayer before bed.

Meanwhile, I just mowed my lawn, made French press coffee, and checked my portfolio (a savings account and my sanity). Still green. Still breathing. Still not checking RSI like it holds the secrets of the universe.

Every dip gets spun into bullish hopium. It’s not a market anymore it’s a cult with a Telegram group.

And hey, I’m not judging. I’ve been there. I know what it’s like to stare at a red candle and convince yourself it’s just “accumulation.”

But I left the casino. I cashed out my chips. I realized I wasn’t investing… I was coping with better graphics.

Anyway wishing you all the best. I hope your coin built on vibes and vaporware hits $10 one day.

But for me? Peace > pump.

Stay grounded. Stay safe. And for the love of sanity… stop saying “it’s early.”

We served great coffee, fresh food, and our customers loved us. People would leave nice comments, compliment the vibe, and even share our posts online.

But here’s the truth: Likes and compliments don’t pay the bills.
And hope is not a business strategy.

I wish I understood this one thing sooner. The difference between surviving and growing predictably comes down to understanding traffic.

That blind spot cost me $163,000.
It cost me my business. It almost cost me my marriage. And I’m still paying the debt today.

We had systems for opening the shop, making food, cleaning the place… but we didn’t have a system to get customers in the door. No strategy. No way to track what was working. Just random acts of marketing.

A Facebook post here. A sign outside. A billboard we couldn’t track. And we’d just hope people would come.

But hope doesn’t create consistency.
A real business needs traffic systems, just like it needs operations systems.

Here’s what I’ve learned since then, after years of studying what actually works (and a huge shoutout to Russell Brunson and his book Traffic Secrets for opening my eyes): There are 3 types of traffic every business owner needs to understand.

1. Traffic You Earn, word of mouth, organic posts. Someone stumbles across your shop. Great when it happens, but totally unpredictable.

2. Traffic You Control, paid ads like Facebook, Google, whatever. You pay money to get people to see your offer. It’s only smart if you have a way to track your return.

3. Traffic You Own, this is the gold. Your customer list. Your email list. Your text list.

When you own your traffic, you’re not at the mercy of algorithms or hope. You can follow up, stay top of mind, and actually build a relationship.

Most local businesses are stuck relying only on #1. Some try #2 but get scared because they don’t have a system to track what’s working.

But the 1% that are thriving? They know how to turn traffic they earn and control into traffic they own. And that’s when business gets predictable.

That’s when you can afford to hire help. Take a day off. Sleep at night without wondering if the bills will get paid.

And the best part? Once it’s set up, most of this can run 90% on autopilot.

I’m not saying this to sell anything.
I just wish someone would’ve told me this before I learned it the hard way.

So basically been in a 13 years relationship where porn caused a lot of problems. Apart from that, he had some anger issues also, over seemingly small stuff and would then ""harass"" me for hours on end, being very upset. But the rest of the time we were fine and we had a great connection. I loved him. We talked about having a family together. 

There have been  breaches of trust after 2 years, like finding he would go on some sex sites where people were meeting up for sex, or with adresses of swinging clubs, while he was in vacation. Or that he kept on searching for porn even though this was a deal breaker for me. He said that for him it wasn't normal to forbid your partner to watch porn so he just kept on doing it. 

These betrayals  + the swinger site was a huuuuge trauma for me. He said he never actually meant to meet anyone and it was just fantasy. Developed huge phobia over all type of sexual content from that point, to the point of having panic attacks when I would find sexual content on his phone (Instagram, porn...). Whole relationship went downhill, because I asked to control his phone and computer use. 

He became more angry at me of course with the years. He took back his phone and even though he stopped watching porn (I had access to wifi!) , he would start searching sexual content on Facebook and Netflix. In the end we broke up because I was getting soooo resentful of his continued betrayals that I was also starting to watch porn to ""make him pay""  every time I had found it he searches for half naked women on FB or Instagram, and even went as far as selling a Webcam to a guy (paid Webcam) one time. He had started to lose my respect and it was showing unfortunately.... , also I was really feeling terrible rage towards him because of how crippled I had become in my life because of all his betrayals (couldn't get out the house  in 8 years without him at this point, because I ""knew"" he would search sexual content when I was out, so lost all activity and friends) and I was extremely resentful that he still wanted to keep his phone when I was going out the house seeing the crippling impact it had on me. For him, I was basically the problem, not him, because I had développed this because of being SA as a child, so it was not his responsibility, I should just see a psychologist. He would also say he didn't want to be ""castrated"" by a women and I was ""castrating"" him. 

This has impacted my whole life, I lost a lot of relationships because of this and was constantly on edge, and depressed (showers were a nightmare and I would have crippling anxiety as he was ALWAYS on his phone during my showers).

In the end he became extremely cruel during fights (attacking me on my appearance, saying he wished he would fall in love with someone else else...) so I broke with him. 

When we broke up during a year, I kinda acted out (I have quiet BPD) over the course of the year, and went to work as a pole dancer in a restaurant (pole dancing used to be a hobby!) for 3 weeks,  then as a hostess in a Nightclub, and finally worked for 10 days as a stripper in a strip club. It wasn't for the sexual thrill AT ALL but to claim back my power in a way, rebuild my self esteem and to face my trauma (my worst nightmare were strip clubs), this way I thought I wouldnt be afraid of it anymore in a way (exposure therapy kind of way). Also I loved dancing, the easy money I made (had zero euro on my account... ) and he would prevent me from going out most of the times, so I really missed clubbing & dancing. Also it made me feel better as I was severely depressed and suicidal after we broke up. 


Missed him dearly despite the fights, and I told him after a year I would take him back ONLY IF he would accept to give me his phone and computer when I was outside the house or in another room of the house. Told him I understood this was a LOT to ask for but that would be the only way as I couldn't take any more trauma. 

He accepted, and showed a lot of patience in the beginning, waiting up to 1h45 sometimes in the morning to get his phone and computer (we both work from home) after he got up. 

In the meantime I had developed severe CPTSD & mood dysregulation because of all the trauma he put me thought, so I was in a bad mood every morning before I would smoke weed (I was feeling super depressed and still had untreated anger lingering...). It would last 10 min then I would be fine once I smoked. I wouldn't like talk bad to him but would throw around my makeup more that usual or in more erratic ways, or press in buttons more aggressively, or if I asked him if he misplaced something, it would be in a not so nice tone. Other that that I would NEVER start fights or be mean with him or even disagreeable. Maybe I was least considerate with him overall, because of all the built in anger (I was never able to express my anger or he would become suuuuper angry at me).
I also didn't enjoy being cuddly with him because of all the trust issues, so he would always have to initiate, which built resentment in him. 

After a month I told him the truth about where I had worked. Because I am a very honest person and he deserved to know the truth. He became crazy upset and told me I had severe mental health issues. He belittled me daily for 6 month about it, until I said I could take any belittling anymore,that this was now 6 moths, that yes it was a mistake on my part and I was sorry but that we had to move forward as that was not a healthy dynamic. 

He stopped belittling me but now he would spend like 14 hours on his computer (work and fun) PER day, so I was basically stuck near him with his computer all day long.. I was becoming crazy.. . so I said couldn't take it anymore to be in the same room and asked him to have a one hour break during the day where I could relax in another room or take a bath...

He went crazy on ""how I dare asking for baths when he already waits up to 2h in the mornings and am not even nice to him when I arrive in the mornings""!! "" and how"" this is all what I have constructed and now not want to be a part of it and it's ridiculous"". 

He then said that "" if I would start taking baths during the day, he would just go outside and walk of have a coffee on a terrasse"" (what gave me MORE anxiety because in the past he would threaten to"" go watch girls outside if he couldn't watch girls inside on his phone!!) 

Is it me who is being unreasonable? Well I said yes IF he agreed to the computer thing but i cannot have NEVER me-time or time to relax in another room. 

Other than that he was being still sweet - still had some anger issues where he would harass  me for hours - but it escalated way less than before.

(just a note; I havn't played SOTM. I'm a huge wuss and while I adore horror movies and scary stories, horror games are something I just havnt been able to do. but I adore the lore and story of these games and try to keep up best i can without playing them myself)

Ok. But. Can we talk about the Stay Up Latte? It looks like a toy for a child. Its scarily reminiscent of the story Wes Craven claimed to have read that inspired Nightmare on Elm Street. Its about a child who was so scared of his nightmares that he kept a coffee pot in his closet to stay awake. His parents didn't know about the coffee pot and doctors gave him sleeping pills but he'd been spitting them out and hiding them in the closet, too. Eventually he was so exhausted he fell asleep and his parents carried him up to bed. Not long after his parents woke up to his screaming but when they got to him he was already dead.

The story Wes said he'd read has never actually been verified as true but there is something called Nightmare Syndrome where people with serious trauma have severe nightmares that its believed to have caused heart attacks and death. I dont know if its 100% a proven thing but it is the basis for Nightmare on Elm Street.

I find it very very unlikely that Scott and the other writers wouldn't know about this story. Its super well known in the horror community.

Could it just be an Easter egg? Possibly.

Could it be implying something? Considering the Moon Man in the basement? Considering the DCA Moon? I feel like there is more to it than just a little in joke for horror buffs. I mean, didn't Matpat do a theory on something like this when FNAF 4 came out?

I'm not a big fan of any kind of ""dream"" theory but we do know there is plenty of supernatural stuff in FNAF. A sleep ""demon"" of sorts isn't out of the question, is it?",2,1750603723.0,fivenightsatfreddys,0,1.0,False

1lhpn91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ketoinfos/comments/1lhpn91/how_to_get_iron_on_vegan_diet/,how to get iron on vegan diet,"Check the Full Details Article Here: https://geteasymoney.org/how-to-get-iron-on-vegan-diet/

Iron is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including oxygen transport, energy metabolism, and immune system support. For those following a vegan diet, it's important to understand how to get iron on a vegan diet to maintain adequate levels and prevent deficiencies.

There are two types of dietary iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron, found in animal products, is more easily absorbed by the body. Non-heme iron is present in plant-based foods, and while its absorption is lower, it can still meet the nutritional needs of vegans with proper meal planning.

Here are some excellent plant-based sources of non-heme iron:

- **Legumes:** Lentils, chickpeas, and beans are not only rich in iron but also provide protein and fiber.
- **Seeds and Nuts:** Pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and almonds are great snacks that also boost iron intake.
- **Whole Grains:** Quinoa, oats, and brown rice offer iron along with other vital nutrients.
- **Dark Leafy Greens:** Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard are packed with iron, especially when cooked.
- **Dried Fruits:** Apricots, raisins, and prunes contain iron and make for nutritious snacks.

To enhance iron absorption from these foods, pair them with vitamin C-rich options like citrus fruits, bell peppers, and broccoli. Avoid consuming tea or coffee with meals, as tannins can inhibit iron absorption. Pay attention to your overall diet, ensuring a balanced intake of nutrients to support optimal health.

By focusing on a variety of iron-rich foods and strategic meal combinations, it's entirely feasible to maintain healthy iron levels on a vegan diet. Keeping an eye on your dietary choices will empower you to thrive while adhering to vegan principles.

2 hours ago I cracked one in half, it broke up a bit but I licked up the dust and chunks and put the other half back. Drank it back with a cup of coffee.

So far, I haven't felt what I expected. I feel as if I took my typical dose of kratom, but with extra itches. Nothing intense at all.

Edit: feels maybe even less than my kratom dose. Don't see the addiction potential of 10mg atm.

TLDR first: My intuition keeps assuming the worst in my interpersonal relationships which is almost always wrong, but going against it feels really unnatural and honestly really hard. I don't know how I'm suppose to feel and honestly feel so stuck.

Growing up, whether it was due to the autism or the no-brain-to-mouth filter or even just the people around me, I had a hard time maintaining friendships and being ""too much"". Led to a really depressing childhood and highschool where I was always left behind. Because of this, I think my intuition has come to always assume that I just wasn't likeable and people didn't want me around, even well into adulthood. I hardly rsvp'd to events or showed up, and if I did would usually hang around in the back for an hour or two before leaving. I barely made an effort to have conversations or meet people. Don't get me wrong, I always maintained my politeness and masked ""appropriately"" to appear as friendly as I could manage if I did talk to someone, but never really tried hard enough to make friends.

I have since learned that I was quite mistaken over the years - people *did* actually want to know me and wanted to talk to me, or that they *did* want me at some events and wondered where I was. Honestly, I would say it was a factor that led to my last relationship failing: I'd constantly cancel gaming plans with my ex because I assumed he would have more fun without me - at least, that was what my intuition was telling me. He eventually got upset and told me he actually wanted to play with me, something I was quite surprised with hearing.

Honestly, you could say that the concept of someone actually wanting me around and wanting to spend time with me feels really foreign to me. I don't really believe it even if people told me that to my face.

So, now I'm kinda stuck in a new feeling that I have no idea how to process - I'm really interested in this girl romantically, and have asked her out for a coffee. She said yes, and we will be meeting soon (have a tentative day planned). Problem is, now my gut is telling me that she is not interested and she is just being nice - we don't text and every time we spoke in person it was from my initiation. Facts, though: we barely know each other, we see each other at most once a week and have about 15 mins together due to what we do, and have spoken at most for probably only an hour and a half all up in the past two months.

My friend told me to stop assuming and to stop being so negative when I told her how I'm feeling, but my intuition is telling me that it's already over and she's not interested...I'm so confused, and honestly hate being like this and feeling this way. I don't see my psych for another two weeks but I'll definitely be talking this out with her. So I guess I'm just wondering, has anyone experienced something similar before and have any insights to give?",7,1750603565.0,AutismInWomen,6,0.9,False

So basically been in a 13 years relationship where porn caused a lot of problems. Apart from that, he had some anger issues also, over seemingly small stuff and would then ""harass"" me for hours on end, being very upset. But the rest of the time we were fine and we had a great connection. I loved him. We talked about having a family together. 

There have been  breaches of trust after 2 years, like finding he would go on some sex sites where people were meeting up for sex, or with adresses of swinging clubs, while he was in vacation. Or that he kept on searching for porn even though this was a deal breaker for me. He said that for him it wasn't normal to forbid your partner to watch porn so he just kept on doing it. 

These betrayals  + the swinger site was a huuuuge trauma for me. He said he never actually meant to meet anyone and it was just fantasy. Developed huge phobia over all type of sexual content from that point, to the point of having panic attacks when I would find sexual content on his phone (Instagram, porn...). Whole relationship went downhill, because I asked to control his phone and computer use. 

He became more angry at me of course with the years. He took back his phone and even though he stopped watching porn (I had access to wifi!) , he would start searching sexual content on Facebook and Netflix. In the end we broke up because I was getting soooo resentful of his continued betrayals that I was also starting to watch porn to ""make him pay""  every time I had found it he searches for half naked women on FB or Instagram, and even went as far as selling a Webcam to a guy (paid Webcam) one time.

It was 0500 hours when the first light of dawn broke over the ragged hedgerows of the French countryside. The sky was an indifferent muddy gray, like everything else in Normandy. The 93rd Infantry's camp was already stirring. Gunfire had settled for the moment, giving the soldiers a rare pause between chaos and more chaos.

Lieutenant Donnelly pushed through the flap of the chow tent, the stink of boiled grit and burnt meat slapping him in the face. Inside, mess privates were slinging whatever supplies hadn’t been claimed by better-funded outfits. The coffee pot—a giant, dented aluminum drum—sat in a cradle of rusted iron, radiating an aroma best described as ""scorched.""

Lieutenant Andrews, already seated at a folding table that had once been white and now looked like it had lost a bar fight, raised a tin cup in mock salute. “Morning, sunshine.”

Donnelly grunted and poured himself a cup from the communal vat. He sipped it—and immediately gagged.

“What in the hell—” he sputtered, wiping his mouth on his sleeve and eyeing the cup like it had insulted his mother.

Andrews looked up. “What’s wrong?”

“This coffee tastes like battery acid.”

Andrews shrugged and lifted his own cup, sipping with the slow patience of a man who had already made peace with several war crimes, this cup of coffee included. “Beats the crap outta what I grew up on. You gonna finish that?” He nodded at Donnelly’s cup.

“You *like* this stuff?”

“I grew up in Chicago. Sure, we had whisky and guns. You don’t hear about the coffee so awful it could be used to strip paint—or interrogate prisoners.”

Donnelly considered that a moment. “Oh,” he said. “I guess it all depends on where you come from.”

Andrews leaned back on his stool. “Want to get in the grit line?”

“You *like* that tasteless paste?”

“I’m from Alabama,” Andrews said, smiling proudly.

“Oh,” Donnelly replied flatly. “That explains it.”

At that moment, a corporal from Texas strolled past, his sleeves rolled to the elbow and his face red from too many sunburns and too few days off. He had a mess tray in hand, but was scraping something suspiciously meat-like into the trash barrel.

“Don’t eat the sausage,” he said to no one in particular. “I don’t think it’s real meat.”

Andrews glanced over at Donnelly. “What *is* it, then?”

The Texan didn’t even break stride. “Don’t ask questions you ain’t ready to lose sleep over.”

“Could be horse,” Andrews offered, watching the meat steam faintly as it met the bottom of the barrel.

“Could be saddlebag,” Donnelly added, deadpan.

“Could be leftover Nazis,” said a third voice.

A skinny kid named Flynn—Private First Class and resident conspiracy theorist—slid into the tent carrying an untouched tray. His helmet was askew, as usual, and his shirt was stained with something that might have been mustard or might have been something far worse.

“Leftover what?” Andrews asked.

Flynn pulled up a chair. “Nazis. Meat’s been disappearing from the supply trucks. So what if—”

Donnelly raised a hand. “Nope. Nope. Don’t finish that thought. I *already* have to sleep in a hole next to someone who snores like a freight train.”

Flynn continued undeterred, “I’m just saying. You ever seen sausage with *teeth marks* on the inside?”

The table fell quiet for a beat.

“I have now,” Andrews muttered, pushing his tray an inch away.

The tent flap opened again, and Lieutenant Stewart, the quartermaster, strode in with the grim determination of a man who had just fought a logistics war and lost. He was holding something brown and tubular in his tongs, as if unsure whether it was food or part of a decomposing boot.

“Stewart,” Donnelly called, “what *is* that?”

Stewart looked down at the item in question. “This?” He shook the tongs for effect. “This is called Protein Segment Type 4. According to the crate, it contains no fewer than three government-approved food sources.”

“Government-approved,” Flynn said suspiciously. “So *nothing natural*, then.”

“Correct.”

Stewart dropped it with a wet plop onto an empty tray. It bounced. Twice.

Andrews took another sip of his coffee. “Chicago coffee’s looking pretty good now, huh?”

Donnelly sighed. “We’ve survived artillery barrages, land mines, and sniper nests, and the thing that finally breaks me is *breakfast*.”

“That’s the army for you,” said Andrews. “The real enemy is the meal plan.”

A medic walked by just then, stopped at their table, and pointed at the grits. “Word of advice. Use the hot sauce. Not *on* the grits. *In* the grits. Dissolve it.”

“Dissolve what?” Donnelly asked.

“The flavor. And possibly the grits themselves.”

Andrews nodded solemnly. “Tactical culinary deterrent. Got it.”

Just then, a shout rang out from the mess tent’s entrance. Sergeant Collins had just arrived, his eyes bloodshot and his expression grim. He held a coffee cup in one hand and a fork in the other like a weapon.

“I just watched a rat die next to the stove,” he announced. “Didn’t eat anything. Just *smelled* the food. Dropped dead.”

Flynn perked up. “That confirms my theory—”

“Shut it, Flynn,” said three voices in unison.

As the tent settled back into its uneasy silence, a low rumble echoed in the distance—German artillery, perhaps, or thunder. Hard to say. The sky was still that same uncaring shade of gray.

Donnelly leaned over his tray, defeated. “You know what the worst part is?”

Andrews raised an eyebrow.

“I think I’m getting used to it.”

Andrews gave a tight, knowing nod. “That’s the true cost of war.”

“Not the wounds. Not the death.”

“Not even the rats.”

“No,” Donnelly said with finality. “It’s the coffee.”

Andrews lifted his cup in a toast. “To survival.”

Flynn joined in. “To grits that don’t fight back.”

Even Stewart, grim-faced,  nodded. “To whatever the hell this is.”

And somewhere outside, under the pale morning sky, another day of war waited. But for a few sacred minutes in the chow tent, as bad coffee passed for comfort and suspect meat was debated like art, the soldiers of the 93rd found something dangerously close to peace.

But here's the million-dollar question: what time does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast? Miss that cutoff, and you're stuck with regular menu items when your soul needs that perfect morning Mexican food fix.

The short answer? Most Taco Bell locations stop serving breakfast at 11:00 AM sharp. But if you think it's that simple, you're about to discover why timing your Taco Bell breakfast run requires more strategy than you'd expect.

# The Official Breakdown: What Time Does Taco Bell Stop Serving Breakfast

# Standard Operating Hours

Taco Bell typically serves breakfast from 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM every single day. That's your golden window – four solid hours where you can snag everything from Cheesy Toasted Breakfast Burritos to those legendary Breakfast Crunchwraps that make early mornings worth it.

But here's where it gets interesting. Not every location plays by the same rules. Some spots don't unlock their doors until 8:00 AM, shrinking your breakfast window to three hours. Others wait until 9:00 AM, which honestly feels like they're testing your dedication to morning Mexican food.

# The 11 AM Hard Stop

So what time does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast? The magic number is 11:00 AM at most locations. This gives them a competitive edge over places like McDonald's, which cuts off breakfast at 10:30 AM. That extra 30 minutes? It's the difference between breakfast victory and lunch defeat.

The reason Taco Bell can stretch breakfast longer than competitors comes down to kitchen logistics. While burger joints need to clear griddle space for patties, Taco Bell's setup allows breakfast items to coexist with lunch prep. Smart move, honestly.

# Location Variations: Not All Taco Bells Are Created Equal

Here's the plot twist that'll change your breakfast game. As of 2024, approximately 500 out of Taco Bell's 8,500 locations have completely dropped breakfast service. Yeah, you read that right – some franchisees decided morning menus weren't worth the hassle.

# How to Avoid Breakfast Disappointment

Before you roll up expecting your morning fix, use Taco Bell's official store locator with the breakfast filter. This tool will save you from that soul-crushing moment of discovering your local spot doesn't do breakfast at all.

Pro tip: Call ahead if you're making a special trip. Equipment breaks down, supplies run out, and hours can change without warning. A quick phone call beats a disappointed stomach every time.

# Weekend Warriors and Holiday Hours

Weekend breakfast service follows the same general pattern, but some locations start later on Saturday and Sunday. Instead of 7:00 AM, you might find doors opening at 8:00 AM because apparently they think we all want to sleep in on weekends.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Holiday hours throw another curveball into the mix. Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's Day often see modified breakfast schedules or complete closures. Always check before making that holiday morning run.

# The Menu That's Worth Setting an Alarm For

Understanding what time does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast is only half the battle. Let's talk about what you're actually getting during those precious morning hours.

# Price Range Breakdown

|Item Category|Price Range|Best Value Pick|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Breakfast Burritos|$1.89 - $4.39|Cheesy Toasted Breakfast Burrito|
|Breakfast Crunchwraps|$4.19 - $6.49|Classic Breakfast Crunchwrap|
|Breakfast Quesadillas|$3.89 - $4.39|Breakfast Quesadilla Sausage|
|Combo Meals|$5.99 - $7.19|Any combo with hash browns|

# The Heavy Hitters

**Breakfast Crunchwrap**: The undisputed champion of handheld breakfast perfection. Scrambled eggs, cheese, hash browns, and protein wrapped in a grilled flour tortilla. It won't fall apart in your car, and it tastes like morning triumph.

**Cheesy Toasted Breakfast Burrito**: At $1.89, this is basically highway robbery in your favor. Scrambled eggs and melted cheese in a golden, crispy tortilla that delivers maximum satisfaction per dollar spent.

**Breakfast Quesadillas**: Three-cheese blend, fluffy eggs, and your choice of protein. The steak version hits different when you need that morning protein boost to power through your day.

# Timing Your Visit Like a Pro

# Peak Hours to Avoid

Rolling up between 8:00-9:00 AM? Expect crowds. Office workers, students, and fellow breakfast enthusiasts are all competing for the same Crunchwraps. Either go early (7:30 AM) or wait until after 9:30 AM for a smoother experience.

# The Last Call Strategy

Knowing what time does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast means understanding the 10:45 AM rule. Don't push your luck past this point. Kitchen staff start transitioning to lunch prep, and you might find limited breakfast options or longer wait times.

# Order Ahead: The Modern Breakfast Hack

The Taco Bell app isn't just convenient – it's your breakfast insurance policy. Place your order at 10:55 AM, and you're still golden as long as you pick up before 11:00 AM. This strategy has saved countless breakfast runs from disaster.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

# Mobile Ordering Benefits

* Skip the line completely
* Customize your order without pressure
* Earn rewards points
* Avoid the ""we just stopped serving breakfast"" conversation

# Regional Differences and Urban vs. Suburban

Metropolitan locations often stick closer to standard hours, while suburban spots might adjust based on local demand patterns. College town locations? They've probably figured out students don't function before 10 AM anyway.

Airport and highway rest stop locations sometimes extend breakfast hours or serve it all day. If you're traveling, these spots might be your salvation when regular locations have switched to lunch.

# What Happens When You Miss the Cutoff

Showed up at 11:05 AM? Don't panic. All Taco Bell locations still serve hot coffee throughout the day, even if they've ditched the breakfast menu. You can grab a regular Crunchwrap Supreme and call it ""brunch"" – nobody's judging your late-morning food choices.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Some locations keep breakfast ingredients available for special requests, but this isn't guaranteed. Your mileage may vary based on staff willingness and ingredient availability.

# Comparing Breakfast Hours Across Fast Food Chains

|Chain|Breakfast End Time|Weekend Difference|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Taco Bell|11:00 AM|Same hours|
|McDonald's|10:30 AM|11:00 AM weekends|
|Burger King|10:30 AM|Same hours|
|Wendy's|10:30 AM|Same hours|
|Sonic|All day|All day|
|Jack in the Box|All day|All day|

Taco Bell's 11:00 AM cutoff gives you that crucial extra 30 minutes compared to most competitors. It's the difference between making it and missing it on those mornings when everything goes sideways.

# The Evolution of Taco Bell Breakfast Service

Since launching nationwide breakfast service on March 27, 2014, Taco Bell has refined their morning game considerably. Early missteps like the Naked Egg Taco and Waffle Taco taught them valuable lessons about what actually works.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Today's breakfast menu focuses on familiar flavors with a Mexican twist, and it's working. Breakfast now accounts for 6% of Taco Bell's total sales, proving people are definitely here for morning Mexican food.

# Advanced Breakfast Strategies

# The Stock-Up Approach

Some breakfast devotees grab extra burritos to reheat later. It's not gourmet, but a microwaved Breakfast Crunchwrap beats no breakfast when you're running late tomorrow.

# The Backup Plan

Keep mental notes of which locations near you serve breakfast and their exact hours. Having two or three options prevents breakfast disasters when your go-to spot is closed or crowded.

# Making the Most of Limited Time Offers

Taco Bell frequently rotates breakfast specials and limited-time offerings. When they announce something new, act fast – popular items often sell out or disappear quickly.

**Your next Taco Bell meal could be covered — learn more at** [**https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/**](https://www.ziigy.com/taco-bell-gift-card/)

Current promotions might include discounted combo meals or exclusive app offers. Check the app regularly for deals that make your breakfast budget stretch further.

# The Bottom Line: Mastering Taco Bell Breakfast Timing

What time does Taco Bell stop serving breakfast? The standard answer is 11:00 AM daily, but success requires understanding the nuances. Some locations start at 7:00 AM, others wait until 8:00 or 9:00 AM, and some don't serve breakfast at all.

Your winning strategy: check the store locator, arrive before 10:45 AM to be safe, and consider using mobile ordering for guaranteed success. The breakfast game at Taco Bell rewards the prepared and punishes the procrastinators.

Master these timing strategies, and you'll never again face the tragedy of showing up for a Breakfast Crunchwrap only to be offered a regular taco instead. Your morning cravings – and your taste buds – will thank you for the effort.

He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",3,1750602920.0,TheCrypticCompendium,1,1.0,False

When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",3,1750602916.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False

When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",3,1750602907.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",2,1750602903.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

When I got the call that my uncle had been arrested again, I wasn’t surprised. He was charming, reckless, and unpredictable—the kind of guy who knew his way around trouble and didn’t seem to mind it. But this time felt different. It wasn’t just a few months; he was facing ten years. A decade behind bars, for possession of over a pound of cocaine. They said it was hidden in the trunk of his car, packed away as casually as groceries. 

It stung. He’d promised us he was clean, that his wild years were behind him. Even at Thanksgiving, he’d go out of his way to remind us all that he was on the straight and narrow. We’d had our doubts—old habits don’t vanish overnight, after all. But a pound? None of us had seen that coming. My uncle swore up and down the drugs weren’t his, said he was framed, that someone wanted to see him gone for good. But when we pressed him on it, he’d just clam up, muttering that spending a decade locked away was better than what ""they"" would do to him.

After he was sentenced, my mom called, her voice tight, asking if I could go to his place and sort through his things. It was typical family duty—the kind of thing I couldn’t turn down. I wasn’t close with him, but family ties run deep enough to leave you feeling responsible, even when you know you shouldn’t.

So, with him locked away for the next ten years, I volunteered to clear out his apartment, move his things to storage. I didn’t know why I was so eager, but maybe I felt like it was the least I could do. The place was a disaster, exactly as I expected. His kitchen cupboards were filled with thrift-store pots and pans, each one more scratched and mismatched than the last. I could see him at the stove, cigarette dangling from his lips, stirring whatever random meal he’d thrown together in those beat-up pans.

The living room was its own kind of graveyard. Ashtrays covered nearly every surface, filled with weeks’ worth of cigarette butts, and the walls were a deep, sickly yellow from years of constant smoke. Even the light switches had turned the same shade, crusted over from the nasty habit that had stained every inch of the place. It was clear he hadn’t cracked a window in years. I found myself running my fingers along the walls, almost wondering if the yellow residue would come off. It didn’t.

In one corner of the room was his pride and joy: a collection of *Star Trek* figurines and posters, lined up on a crooked shelf he’d likely hammered up himself. He’d been a fan for as long as I could remember, always rambling about episodes I’d never seen and characters I couldn’t name. Dozens of plastic figures with blank, determined stares watched me pack up their home, my uncle’s treasures boxed up and ready to be hidden away for who knew how long.

It took a few days, but I finally got the majority of the place packed. Three trips in my truck, hauling boxes and crates to the storage facility across town, until the apartment was stripped bare. The only things left were the stained carpet, the nicotine-coated walls, and the broken blinds barely hanging in the windows. There was no way he was getting his security deposit back; the damage was practically baked into the place. But it didn’t matter anymore.

As I sorted through the last of the kitchen, my hand brushed against something tucked away in the shadows of the cabinet. I pulled it out and found myself holding a small, leather-bound book. The cover was cracked and worn, the leather soft from age, with a faint smell of cigarette smoke clinging to it. The pages inside were yellowed, brittle, and marked with years of kitchen chaos—stains, smudges, and scribbled notes everywhere.

The entries were scattered, written down in no particular order, almost as if whoever kept this book had jotted recipes down the moment they’d been created, without thought of organization. As I skimmed the pages, a feeling crept over me that this book might have belonged to my grandfather. He was the one who’d brought the family together, year after year, with his homemade dishes. Every holiday felt anchored by the meals he’d cooked, recipes no one had ever been able to quite replicate. This book could very well hold the secrets to those meals, a piece of him that had somehow made its way into my uncle’s hands after my grandfather passed. And yet…

I couldn’t shake a strange sense of dread as I held it. The leather was cold against my hands, almost damp, and a chill worked its way through me as I turned the pages. It felt *wrong*, somehow, as if there was more in this book than family recipes.

Curious about the book’s origins, I brought it to my mom. She took one look at the looping handwriting on the yellowed pages and nodded, her face softening with recognition. ""This was your grandfather's,"" she said, almost reverently, tracing her fingers along the ink. She hadn’t seen it in years, and when I told her where I'd found it, a look of surprise flickered across her face. She had been searching for the book for ages and had never realized her brother had kept it all this time.  

As she flipped through the pages, nostalgia mingled with something else—maybe a touch of sadness or reverence. I could tell this book meant a lot to her, which only strengthened my resolve to preserve it. “Could I hang onto it a little longer?” I asked. “I want to scan it, make a digital copy for myself, so we don’t lose any of his recipes.”

My mom agreed without hesitation, grateful that I was taking the time to safeguard something she hadn’t known was still around. So I got to work. Over the next few weeks, in the gaps of my day-to-day life, I carefully scanned each page. I wasn’t too focused on the content itself, more concerned with making sure each recipe was clear and legible, and didn’t pay close attention to the strange ingredients and odd notes scattered throughout. My only goal was to make the text accessible, giving life to a digital copy that would be preserved indefinitely.

Once I finished, I spent a few hours merging the scanned images, piecing them together to create a seamless digital version. When it was finally done, I returned the original to my mom, feeling a strange mix of relief and satisfaction. The family recipes were now safe, and I thought that was the end of it. But that sense of unease I’d felt in the kitchen, holding that worn leather cover, lingered longer than I expected.

In the months that followed, I didn’t think much about the recipe book. Scanning it had been a small side project, the kind I’d meant to follow up on by actually cooking a few of my grandfather’s old dishes. But like so many side projects, I got wrapped up in other things and the book’s contents drifted to the back of my mind, filed away and forgotten.

Then Thanksgiving rolled around. I made my way to my parents’ place, expecting the usual—turkey, stuffing, and the familiar spread that had become tradition. When I got there, though, I noticed something different right away. A large bird sat in the middle of the table, roasted to perfection, but something about it didn’t look right. It was too small for a turkey, and its skin looked darker, almost rougher than the golden-brown I was used to.  

“Nice chicken,” I said, figuring they’d switched things up for a change. My mom just shook her head.

“It’s not a chicken,” she said quietly. “It’s a hen.”

I gave her a confused look. “What’s the difference?” I asked, half-laughing, expecting her to shrug it off with a quick explanation. Instead, she just stared at me, her eyes unfocused as if she were lost in thought. 

For a moment, her face seemed distant, almost blank, as though I’d asked a question she couldn’t quite place. Then, suddenly, she blinked, her gaze snapping back to me. “It’s just… what the recipe called for,” she said, a strange edge to her voice.

Something about it made the hair on my arms prickle, but I pushed the feeling aside, figuring she’d just been caught up in the cooking chaos. Yet, as I looked at the bird again, a small flicker of unease crept in, settling in the back of my mind like an itch I couldn’t scratch.

After dinner, I pulled my dad aside in the kitchen while my mom finished clearing the table. ""What’s the deal with Mom tonight?"" I asked, keeping my voice low. He just shrugged, brushing it off with a wave of his hand.

“You know how your mother is,” he said with a small smile, as though her strange excitement was just one of those quirks. He didn’t give it a second thought, already moving on.

But I couldn’t shake the weirdness. The whole meal had been… off. The hen, unlike anything we’d had before, was coated in a sweet-smelling sauce that seemed to have a faint hint of walnut to it, almost masking its pale, ashen hue. The bird lay on a bed of unfamiliar greens—probably some sort of garnish—alongside perfectly sliced parsnips and radishes that seemed too neatly arranged, like it was all meant to look a certain way. The whole thing was far too elaborate for my mom’s usual Thanksgiving style.

When she finally sat, she led us in saying grace, her voice soft and reverent. As she began cutting into the hen, a strange glint of excitement lit up her face, one I wasn’t used to seeing. She served it up, watching each of us intently as we took our first bites. I wasn’t sure what I expected, but as I brought a piece to my mouth, I could tell right away this wasn’t the usual Thanksgiving fare. The meat was tough—almost stringy—and didn’t pull apart easily, a far cry from the tender turkey or even chicken I was used to.

Mom kept glancing between my dad and me with a kind of eager glee, as though she were waiting for us to say something. It was unsettling, her eyes wide, as if she were waiting for us to uncover some hidden secret.

When I finally asked, “What’s got you so excited, Mom?” she just smiled, her expression softening.

“Oh, it’s just… this cookbook you found from Grandpa’s things. It’s like having a part of him here with every meal I make.” She spoke with a reverence I hadn’t heard in her voice for a long time, as though she were talking about more than just food.

I gave her a nod, trying to humor her. “Tastes good,” I said, hoping she’d ease up. “I enjoyed it.” But in truth, I wished we’d had a more familiar Thanksgiving dinner. The meal wasn’t exactly bad, but something tasted a little off. I couldn’t put my finger on it, and maybe I didn’t want to.

After we finished, I said my goodbyes and headed home, trying to shake the lingering sense of unease. My mom’s face, her excitement, kept replaying in my mind. And then there was the hen itself. Why a hen? Why the pale, ashen sauce? There was something almost ritualistic in the way she’d prepared it, a strange precision I’d never seen from her before.

The night stretched on, the questions gnawing at me, taking root in a way that wouldn’t let me rest.

When I got home, I couldn’t shake the weird feeling from dinner. I sat down at my desk, opening the scanned file I’d saved to my desktop months ago. The folder had been sitting there, untouched, and now that I finally had it open, I could see why I’d put it off. The handwriting was dense and intricate, almost a kind of calligraphy, each letter curling into the next. The words seemed to dance across the pages in a strange, whimsical flow. I had to squint, leaning closer to make sense of each line.

As I scrolled through the recipes, a chill ran down my spine. They had unsettling names, the kind that felt more like old spells than recipes. *Mother’s Last Supper Porridge*, *Binding Broth of Bone and Leaf*, *Elders’ Emberbread*, *Hollow Heart Soup with Mourning Onion*. I wasn’t sure if it was my imagination, but I could almost feel a heaviness creeping into the room, the words themselves holding an eerie energy. 

Then, I found it—the recipe for the dish my mother had made tonight: *Ancestor’s Offering*. The recipe was titled in that same swirling calligraphy, and I felt a knot tighten in my stomach as I read the description. It was for a Maple-Braised Hen with Black Walnut and Root Purée, though it didn’t sound like any recipe I’d ever seen. The instructions were worded strangely, written in a style that made it feel centuries old. Each ingredient was listed with specific purpose and detail, as though it held some secret power.

My eyes skimmed down to the meat. It specified a hen, not just any chicken. “The body must be that of a mother,” it read. I felt a shiver go through me, remembering the strange way my mom had insisted on using a hen, correcting me when I’d casually referred to it as chicken. 

The instructions continued, noting that the hen had to be served on a bed of Lamb’s lettuce—a type of honeysuckle, according to a quick Google search. And then, as I read further, a chill seeped into my bones. The recipe stated it must be served “just before the end of twilight, as dusk yields to night.” I thought back to dinner, and the way we’d all sat down just as the last of the sun’s light faded beyond the horizon.

But the final instruction was the worst part, and as I read it, my stomach twisted in revulsion. The recipe called for something it referred to as *Ancestor’s Salt*. The note at the bottom explained that this “salt” was a sprinkle of the ashes of “those who have returned to the earth,” with a warning to use it sparingly, as “each grain remembers the one who offered it.”

I sat back, cold sweat breaking out across my skin as I recalled the pale, ashen sauce coating the hen, the faint, sweet scent it gave off. My mind raced, piecing together what it implied. Had my mom actually used… ashes in the meal? Had she… used my grandfather’s ashes?

I tried to shake it off, to tell myself it was just some old folklore nonsense. But the image of her smiling face as she served us that meal, the gleam in her eyes, crept back into my mind. I felt my stomach churn, bile rising in my throat as the horrifying thought sank deeper.

A few days later, the gnawing unease had become impossible to ignore. I told myself I was probably just overreacting, that the weird details in the recipe were nothing more than some strange family tradition I didn’t understand. Still, I couldn’t shake the dread that crept up every time I remembered that meal. So, I decided to call my mom. I planned it out, careful to come off as casual. The last thing I wanted was for her to think I was accusing her of something as insane as putting ashes in our food.

I asked about my dad, about her gardening, anything to warm her up a bit. Then I thanked her for the Thanksgiving dinner, even going so far as to say it was the best we’d had in years. When I finally brought up the recipe book, her voice brightened instantly.

“Oh, thank you again for finding it!” she said, sounding genuinely pleased. “I had no idea he’d cataloged so many wonderful recipes. I knew your grandfather’s cooking was special, but to have all these dishes recorded, like his own little legacy—it’s been such a joy.”

I chuckled, trying to keep my tone light. “I actually looked up that dish you made us, *Ancestor’s Offering*. Thought maybe I’d give it a try myself sometime.” 

“Oh, really?” she replied, sounding intrigued.

“Yeah, though I thought it was a little strange the recipe specifically calls for a hen and not just a regular chicken, since they’re so much tougher. And the part that says it should be ‘the body of a mother’…” I let the words hang, hoping she’d jump in with some explanation that would make it all seem less… sinister.

For a moment, there was just silence on her end. Then, quietly, she said, “Well, that’s just how your grandfather wrote it, I suppose.” Her voice was different now, lower, as if she were carefully choosing her words.

My heart thumped in my chest, and I decided to press a little further. “I also noticed it calls for something called *Ancestor’s Salt*,” I said, feigning confusion, pretending I hadn’t read the footnote that explicitly described it. “What’s that supposed to be?”

The silence was even longer this time, stretching out until it became a ringing hum in my ears. When she finally spoke, her voice was barely a whisper.

“I… I have to go,” she murmured, sounding almost dazed.

Before I could respond, the line clicked, leaving me in the heavy, stunned quiet. I tried calling her back immediately, but it went straight to voicemail. Her phone was off.

My stomach twisted as I stared at the blank screen. I couldn’t tell if I was more scared of what I might find out or of what I might already know.

I hesitated, but eventually called my dad’s phone, feeling a need to at least check in. When he picked up, I told him about my call with Mom and how strange she’d been acting.

“She went into her garden right after you two spoke,” he said, sounding unconcerned. “Started tending to her plants, hasn’t said a word since.”

I tried nudging him a bit, asking if he could maybe get her to talk to me, but he just brushed it off. “You’re overreacting. You know how your mother is—gets all sentimental over family things. It’ll just upset her if you keep nagging her about it. Give her some space.”

I nodded, trying to take his advice to heart. “Yeah… alright. You’re probably right.”

After we hung up, I resolved to let it go and went about my day, chalking it up to my mom’s usual habit of getting overly attached to anything with sentimental value. She’d always treated family heirlooms like they carried something sacred, almost magical. But this time, I couldn’t fully shake the nagging feeling in the back of my mind, something that made it impossible to forget about that recipe book.

Eventually, curiosity got the better of me. Sitting back down at my computer, I opened the digital copy and scrolled aimlessly through the pages. Part of me knew it was a bad idea, but I couldn’t resist. I let the file skip down to a random section, thinking I’d try making something small, something harmless. As I scrolled, I found myself staring at the very last page, which held a recipe titled *Elders’ Emberbread*.

The instructions were minimal, yet each word seemed heavy, steeped in purpose. Beneath the title, a note read: “Best served in small portions on cold, dark nights. The taste is best enjoyed alone—lest the voices of the past linger too long.” 

I shook my head, half-amused, half-unnerved. It was all nonsense, I told myself, probably just some old superstitions my grandfather had picked up along the way. But something about it had my heart pounding just a bit harder. Ignoring the rising chill, I printed the recipe and took it to the kitchen. I’d play along, I figured. It was just bread, after all.

I scanned the list of ingredients for *Elders’ Emberbread*, feeling time slip away as though I’d been pulled into some strange trance. My mind blurred over, details of the process fading into a fog, yet I couldn’t stop moving. I gathered everything without really thinking about it, each step drawing me deeper, as though I were following some ancient, well-worn path. I remembered flashes—the sweet scent of elderberry and honey, the earthy weight of raw rye, the dry, pungent aroma of wood burnt to charcoal. At some point, I murmured something under my breath, words of thanks to my ancestors that I hadn’t consciously decided to speak.

The smell of warmed goat’s milk lingered in the air, blending with a creamy, thick butter that had blackened over low heat. A faint scent of yew ash drifted up as I worked, curling into my nose like smoke from an unseen fire.

By the time I came to my senses, night had fallen, the kitchen shadowed and still. And there, sitting on the counter, was the bread: a dark, dense loaf, blackened at the crust but glistening with an almost unnatural sheen. It looked rich and moist, and as I stared at it, a strange sense of pride swelled up within me, unnatural and unsettling, like a voice in the back of my mind was urging me to feel pleased, insisting that I’d done well.

Without really thinking, I cut myself a slice and carried it to the living room, feeling compelled to “enjoy” my creation. I took a bite, and the bread filled my mouth with an earthy, bittersweet taste, smoky yet tinged with a subtle berry sweetness. It was… unusual, nothing like I’d ever tasted before, but it was oddly satisfying. 

As I chewed, a warmth bloomed deep in my chest, spreading through me like the steady heat of a wood stove. It was comforting, almost intimate, as if the bread itself were warming me from the inside out. Before I knew it, I’d finished the entire slice. Not because I’d particularly enjoyed it, but because some strange sense of obligation had pushed me to finish every bite.

When I set the plate down, the warmth remained, a heavy presence settled deep inside me. And in the silence that followed, I could have sworn I felt a faint, rhythmic beat—a heartbeat, steady and ancient, pulsing faintly beneath my skin.

Over the next few weeks, I found myself drawn back to the *Elders’ Emberbread* more often than I intended. I’d notice myself in the kitchen, knife in hand, halfway through slicing a thick piece from the loaf before even realizing I’d gotten up to do it. It was instinctive, almost as if some quiet impulse guided me back to it on those quiet, late nights.

Each time I took a bite, that same deep warmth would swell inside me, radiating outward like embers glowing from a steady fire. But unlike the hen my mother had made—a meal that left me with a lingering sense of discomfort—the Emberbread felt different. It was as though each bite carried something I couldn’t quite place, something familiar and almost affectionate, like a labor of love embedded into every grain.

The days blended together, but the questions didn’t go away. I tried to reach out to my mother several times, hoping she might open up about the recipe book, maybe explain why we both seemed so drawn to these strange meals. But each time I brought it up, she’d evade the question, either changing the subject or claiming she was too busy to talk.

She hadn’t invited me over for dinner since Thanksgiving, and the distance between us felt like a slow, widening gulf. Even my dad, when I’d asked about her, shrugged it off, saying she was “just going through a phase.” But the coldness in her responses, her repeated avoidance of the book, only made me more certain that there was something she wasn’t telling me.

Still, I kept returning to the Emberbread, feeling its subtle pull each time the sun set, as though I were being guided by something unseen. And each time I took a bite, it felt less like a meal and more like… communion, a quiet bond that was growing stronger with every piece I consumed.

After weeks of unanswered questions, I decided to reach out to my uncle at the prison. I was allowed to leave a message, so I kept it short—told him it was his nephew, wished him well, and let him know I’d left him a hundred bucks in commissary. The next day, he called me back, his voice scratchy over the line but appreciative.

“Hey, thanks for the cash,” he said with a short chuckle. “You know how it is in here—money makes things easier.”

We chatted for a bit, catching up. He’d been in and out of prison so often that I’d come to see it as his way of life. In his sixties now, he talked about his time behind bars with a kind of acceptance, almost relief. “By the time I’m out again, I’ll be an old man,” he said, almost amused. “It’s not the worst place to grow old.”

Then I took a breath and brought up the reason I’d called. “I don’t know if you remember, but when I was packing up your place, I found this old recipe book.” I hesitated, then quickly added, “I, uh, gave it to Mom. Thought she’d get a kick out of it.”

His response was immediate. The warm, casual tone in his voice shifted, growing cold and sharp. “Listen to me,” he said, each word weighted and deliberate. “If you have that book, you need to throw it into a fire.”

“What?” I stammered, caught off guard. “It’s just a cookbook.”

“It’s not ‘just a cookbook,’” he replied, his voice low, almost trembling. “That book… it brings out terrible things in people.” He paused, as though considering how much to say. “My father—your grandfather—he was into some dark stuff, stuff you don’t just find in the back of an old family recipe. And that book?” He took a breath. “That book wasn’t his. It belonged to *his* mother, your great-grandmother, passed down to him before he even knew what it was. My mother used to say those recipes were meant for desperate times.”

The gravity of his words settled into me, and I felt the weight of it all suddenly make sense.

“They were used to survive hard times,” he continued, voice quiet. “You’ve heard about what people did during the Great Depression, how desperate families were… but this?” He exhaled sharply. “Those recipes are ancient. Passed down through whispers and word of mouth long before they were ever written down. But they’re not for everyday meals. They’re for… invoking things, bringing things out. The kind of things that can take hold of you if you’re not careful.”

My hand tightened around the phone as a cold shiver traced down my spine, my mind flashing back to the Emberbread, the warmth it had left in my chest, the strange satisfaction that hadn’t felt entirely my own.

“Promise me,” he continued, his voice almost pleading. “Don’t let Mom or anyone else use that book for anything casual. Those recipes can keep a person alive in hard times, sure, but they weren’t meant to be used… not unless you’re ready to live with the consequences.” 

A chill settled over me as I realized just how deep this all went.

I hesitated, then told my uncle the truth—I’d already made one of the recipes. I described *Elders’ Emberbread* to him, the earthy sweetness, the warmth it filled me with, leaving out the part about how I’d almost felt compelled to eat it. He let out a harsh sigh and scolded me, his voice sharper than I’d ever heard. “You shouldn’t have touched that bread. None of it. Do you understand me?”

I felt a pang of guilt. “I know… I’m sorry. I promise, I won’t make anything else from the book.”

“Good,” he said, his voice calming a little. “But that’s not enough. You have to get that book away from my sister—your mother—before she does something she can’t take back.”

I tried to assure him I’d do what I could, but he cut me off, his tone deadly serious. “You *need* to do this. Something bad will happen if you don’t.”

Over the next few weeks, as Christmas approached, I stayed in touch with him, paying the collect call fees to keep our conversations going. Every time we talked, the discussion would circle back to the book. I’d tell him about my progress, or lack of it—how I’d tried visiting my mom, only for her to brush me off with excuses, saying she was too busy or that it wasn’t a good time. And each time I talked to her, she seemed to grow colder, more distant, as if that recipe book were slowly casting a shadow over her.

One day, I decided to drop by without any notice at all. When I showed up on her doorstep, she didn’t seem pleased to see me. “You should’ve called first,” she said with a forced smile. “It’s rude, you know, just showing up like this.” Her tone was tight, her words clipped.

I tried to play it off, shrugging and saying I’d just missed her and wanted to check in. But as I scanned the house, I felt a creeping sense of unease. I looked for any sign of the book, hoping I could find it and take it with me, but it was nowhere to be seen. Each time, I’d leave empty-handed, feeling like I was being watched from the shadows as I walked out the door.

Every call with my uncle became more urgent, his insistence that I retrieve the book growing into a kind of desperation. “You have to try harder,” he’d say, his voice strained. “If you don’t get that book away from her, *something’s going to happen*. You have to believe me.”

And deep down, I did believe him. The memory of the Emberbread, the strange warmth, and the subtle pull of that old recipe gnawed at me, as though warning me of something far worse waiting in that book. But it was more than that—something in my mom’s voice, her distant gaze, even her scolding felt *off*. And every time I left her house, I felt a chill settle over me, like I was getting closer to something I wasn’t prepared to see.

Christmas Day finally arrived, and despite my mother’s recent evasions, there was no avoiding me this time. I gathered up the presents I’d bought for them, packed them into my car, and drove to their house, hoping the tension that had grown between us would somehow ease in the warmth of the holiday.

When I knocked, she opened the door and offered a quick, halfhearted hug. The scent of baked ham and sweet glaze wafted out, thick and rich, and for a second, I thought maybe she’d set aside that strange recipe book and returned to her usual cooking. I relaxed a little, hoping the day would be less tense than I’d feared.

“Where’s Dad?” I asked, glancing around for any sign of him.

“Oh, he’s in the garage,” she said, waving it off. “Got a new gadget he’s fussing over, you know him.” She gestured toward the dining room, where plates and holiday decorations were already set up. “Why don’t you sit down? Lunch is almost ready.”

I took off my coat, glancing back at her. She was already turned away, busying herself with the last touches on the table, and I couldn’t help but feel a pang of discomfort. Her movements were stiff, almost mechanical, and I could sense the familiar warmth in her was missing. It was like she was there but somehow… *absent*.

Not wanting to disobey my mother on Christmas, I placed my gifts with the others under the tree and took my seat at the dining table. The plate in front of me was polished and waiting, a silver fork and knife perfectly aligned on either side, but the emptiness of it left an unsettling pit in my stomach.

“Should I go get Dad?” I called out, glancing back toward the hallway that led to the garage. He’d usually be the first to greet me, especially on a holiday. The silence from him was off-putting.

“He’ll come when he’s ready,” my mother replied, her voice carrying from the kitchen. “He had a big breakfast, so he can join us later. Let’s go ahead and start.”

Something about her response didn’t sit right. It wasn’t like my dad to skip a Christmas meal, not for any reason. A small, insistent thought tugged at me—maybe it was the book again, casting shadows over everything in my mind, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong.

“I’ll just go say hello to him,” I said, rising from the table.

Before I’d even taken a step, she entered the dining room, carrying a large ham on an ornate silver platter. The meat was dark and glossy, almost blackened, the glaze thick and rich, coating every criss-crossed cut she’d made in the skin. The bone jutted out starkly from the center, pale against the charred flesh.

“Sit down,” she said, her voice oddly stern, a hint of irritation slipping through her usual holiday warmth. “This is a special meal. We should enjoy it together.”

I stopped, glancing from her to the closed door of the garage, the words “special meal” repeating in my head, setting off warning bells. Still, I stood my ground, my stomach churning.

“I just want to see Dad, that’s all. I haven’t even said hello.”

Her face tensed, her grip tightening around the platter as her voice rose. “*Sit down* and enjoy lunch with me.” The words hung in the air, heavy and unyielding, like a command I was supposed to follow without question.

But I couldn’t shake the feeling that something terrible was lying just beneath the surface of her insistence.

“No,” I snapped, my voice echoing through the dining room. “I’ve had enough of this, Mom! You’ve been obsessed with that damn recipe book, and I’m done with it.” My heart pounded as I looked at her, my words hanging thick in the silence, but I didn’t back down. “I’m going to the garage to get Dad. We’re putting an end to this right now.”

Her face contorted, desperation spilling from her eyes. “Please, just sit down,” she pleaded, her voice cracking as she looked at the untouched plate in front of me. “Let’s have this meal together. It’s… it’s important.”

I took a step toward the garage, determined to get my dad out here, to make him see how far she’d gone. That book had wormed its way too deep into her mind. She shrieked and threw herself in front of the door, arms outstretched as if to block my path. Her face was flushed, her voice frantic.

“*Don’t go in there.* Please, just sit down. Enjoy the meal, savor it,” she begged, her hands trembling as she reached out, practically pleading. There was a desperation in her voice that sounded like fear, not just of me but of what lay beyond that door.

“Mom, you’re acting crazy! We need to talk, and I need to see Dad.” I tried to push past her, but she held her ground, her body a thin, shaky barrier.

“*Please*,” she whispered, voice thin and desperate. “You don’t understand. Don’t disturb him—”

“Dad!” I called out, raising my voice over her pleas. Silence answered at first, followed by a muffled sound—a low, guttural moan, thick and unnatural, rising from the other side of the door. I froze, my blood turning cold as the sound slipped into a horrible, wet gurgle. My mother’s face went white, her eyes wide with terror as she realized I’d heard him.

I felt a surge of adrenaline take over, and before she could react, I shoved her aside and yanked open the door. 

The sight that met me would be seared into my memory forever.

I stepped into the garage and froze, my stomach lurching at the scene before me. My dad lay sprawled across his workbench, his face pale and slick with sweat. His right leg was tied tightly with a belt just above the thigh, a makeshift tourniquet attempting to staunch the flow of blood. A pillowcase was wrapped around the raw, exposed flesh where his leg had been crudely severed, and blood pooled on the concrete floor beneath him, glistening in the cold fluorescent light.

He lifted his head weakly, his eyes glassy and unfocused. His mouth moved, trying to form words, a barely audible rasp escaping as he struggled to speak. “Help… me…”

I didn’t waste a second. I pulled out my phone and dialed 911, my fingers shaking so badly it was hard to hit the right buttons. My mother’s shrill screams erupted from behind me as she lunged into the garage, her hands clawing at the air, pleading.

“Stop! *Please!* Just sit down—just have lunch with me!” she wailed, her voice high-pitched and frantic. Her face was twisted in desperation, tears streaming down her cheeks. But I didn’t listen. I couldn’t. I backed up, keeping a wide berth between her and my dad, and relayed the horror I was seeing to the dispatcher.

“It’s my dad… he’s lost his leg. He’s barely conscious,” I stammered, voice cracking. “Please, you need to hurry.”

The dispatcher assured me that help was on the way, asking me to stay on the line, but my mother’s desperate cries filled the garage, creating a haunting echo. She clutched at her head, her fingers digging into her scalp as she repeated, “Please, just come back to the table. Just eat. *You have to eat*!”

I kept my distance, heart pounding, as I watched her spiral into a frantic haze. But she never laid a finger on me; she only circled back to the door, wailing and begging in a chilling frenzy that made my blood run cold.

The police arrived within minutes, their lights flashing against the house, and rushed into the garage to assess the situation. My mother resisted, screaming and flailing as they restrained her, her pleas becoming incoherent sobs as they led her away. I could barely breathe as I watched them take her, her voice a haunting wail that echoed down the driveway, begging me to come back and join her at the table.

Paramedics rushed in and began working on my dad, quickly stabilizing him and loading him onto a stretcher. I followed them outside, numb with shock, barely able to process the scene that had unfolded. In the frigid December air, my mind reeled, looping over her chilling words and the horrible sight in that garage.

That Christmas, the warmth of family and familiarity had turned into something I could barely comprehend, twisted into a nightmare I would never forget.

I stayed by my father’s side every day at the hospital, watching over him as he slowly regained strength. On good days, when the painkillers were working and his mind was clearer, he told me everything he could remember about the last month with my mother. She’d been making strange, elaborate meals every single night since Thanksgiving, insisting he try each one. At first, he thought it was just a new holiday tradition, a way to honor Grandpa’s recipes, but as the dishes grew more unusual, more disturbing, he realized something was deeply wrong. She had started mumbling to herself while she cooked, almost like she was speaking to someone who wasn’t there.

Eventually, he’d stopped eating at the house altogether, sneaking out for meals at nearby diners, finding any excuse he could to avoid her food. He even admitted that on Christmas morning, when he tried to leave, she had drugged his coffee. Everything went hazy after that, and the next thing he remembered was waking up to pain and the horror of what she’d done to his leg.

We discussed the recipe book in hushed tones, both coming to the same terrible conclusion: the book had changed her. My father was hesitant to believe anything so sinister at first, but the memories of her frantic insistence, the look in her eyes, made him certain. Somehow, in some dark, twisted way, the book had drawn her into its thrall.

By New Year’s Eve, he was discharged from the hospital. I promised him I’d stay with him as he recovered, my own guilt over the role I’d unwittingly played gnawing at me. He accepted, his eyes carrying the quiet pain of someone forever altered.

My mother, meanwhile, was undergoing evaluation in a psychiatric hospital. Since that Christmas, I hadn’t seen her. I’d gotten updates from the doctors; they said she was calm, coherent, but that her words remained disturbing. She admitted to doing what she did to my father, repeating over and over, “We need to do what we must to survive the darkest days of the year.” Her voice would drop to a whisper, a distant look in her eyes, as though the phrase were a sacred mantra. 

On New Year’s Eve, as the minutes ticked toward midnight, my father and I went out to his backyard fire pit. I carried the recipe book, feeling its familiar weight in my hands one last time. Without a word, I tossed it into the fire, watching as the flames curled around the old leather, devouring the yellowed pages. It crackled and twisted in the heat, the recipes that had plagued us dissolving into ash. My father’s hand on my shoulder was the only anchor I had as the smoke rose, dissipating into the cold night air.

But as the last ember faded, I felt a pang of something like regret. Later, as I sat alone, staring at my computer, I hovered over the file on my desktop. The digital copy, each recipe scanned and preserved in perfect, chilling detail. I knew I should delete it, erase any trace of the book that had shattered my family. And yet… I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I fear that it may have a hold on me.",1,1750602898.0,joinmeatthecampfire,0,1.0,False

(again!),"[Last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Groningen/comments/1d5h44g/do_you_need_a_friend/), I posted on r/Groningen offering to meet up with people who felt lonely, wanted to expand their social circle, or just needed someone to talk to. I've noticed that our little subreddit is, again, getting a lot of those posts about people seeking social contact. Last year I met some interesting people and had great conversations - even though most of those connections didn’t stick long-term, I still look back on it fondly. 

Now, with some free time on my hands again, I figured: why not open that door once more?

So, are you feeling a bit isolated? New to Groningen? Struggling to connect or just in need of a casual walk, chat, or coffee with a fellow human? I’d be happy to meet you.

I’ve lived in Groningen for over 30 years, and I know all the cozy, quiet, weird and fun places you probably won’t find online. I’m into history, art, art history, architecture, fantasy, sci-fi, local politics, cats, baking and videogames. I’m in a happy relationship, so no romantic intentions here. I’m also not big on sports or heavy partying - but if you are, tell me all about it. Listening to passionate people is always a treat, no matter the topic.

I don’t care about your age, gender, background or education. If you’ve got a niche obsession you want to geek out about: I’m all ears. Want to talk about life? Same. Want to just grab a drink and sit in silence for a bit? Also fine.

Also, if you struggle with social anxiety (had a whole bunch of them last time), that’s completely okay - this is not about pushing you out of your comfort zone, but about making you feel good about taking a small step toward new connections. If you'd prefer to start with chatting online, or need a slower pace, I’m happy to adapt.

This time, no WhatsApp group; I learned that doesn’t really work and the momentum gets killed very quickly. So I prefer just one-on-one connections. Send me a message if you’re interested, even if you're a bit hesitant. No pressure.

I speak Dutch and English. And of course, I pay for my own coffees!",21,1750602761.0,Groningen,4,0.96,False

(I jumped around a lot and made edits as I went so might not be the smoothest lol)

So me and my partner have been together for 1.5 years now and all of it has been great until she got a new job around 3 months ago. So she used to have a morning coffee shop job that she worked at, aswell as her co op in college but she was very unhappy at work and always wanted to quit so I told her to and she did. During those days she was very happy outside of work and had a lot of free time where we would be together. 

Now she works at a restraunt instead (which she has fun at work). The main problem is she has ran out of loans or student aid and has to work an ungodly amount to make ends meet for the next few semesters. So she has been working 70 hours a week (40 at coop and 30 on the weekend) because she has to, but I almost feel like she is using it to avoid things or maybe even me aswell. She will stay after work for awhile after she’s off and have drinks and stuff even if we have something small planned like hanging out or seeing eachother. (Now this is totally fine but the problem is it is every single time…)

Another issue is outside of work now she is so burnt out and our relationship seems to be taking a hit. 2 months ago we were in a bit of a rough spot for a bit before we both realized it was her being burnt out and she felt like a “bad girlfriend” because we never do much as much as we used to (this includes intimacy). A lot of times when we are together it’s me initiating all the hugs or anything now, and it’s very rare we get more intimant than cuddling which has also affected me. 

For example last night we had a friends party and she was scheduled till 8, then we would go to that. But she got stuck there in a rush and had to stay till the restraunt almost closed at 10 and by the time she got to the party we were only there for maybe an hour before she was too tired and we had to leave. Even at the party I feel like she didn’t hug me at all or just the small things you know?

And she knows she is burnt out too but she has to do it to pay for school. I love her so much and she loves me too and she always tells me how bad she feels about how this is affecting us, so is it worth the wait? About 6 weeks from now we both go back to classes and she will still work weekends but won’t have 70 hours total a week it will be more like 20-30. And after September she pays off the big number and can return to working a much more normal amount and get some weekend time back.

Also important note we do move in beginning of August together which will bring more time together in itself but just a lot going on right now.

I kind a jumped around a lot typing this but lastly, she deals a lot with anxiety and stuff and current world events have stacked up more with her loans, parents, and well now us… I think it’s possible the anxiety of our relationship right now might be making her avoidant a bit.

So all in all, do we fight for it? I really believe I want to, it’s just been really hard and will continue to be for a little bit.

I’m on O‘ahu and looking for recommendations for great local coffee roasters. I usually make pour overs and lean toward lighter roasts like Ethiopians, naturals, and anything with interesting flavor profiles.

Close to home, I’ve tried Waialua Sugar Mill and Green World, but I’m hoping to find something a little different - ideally with roast dates on the bags and maybe some more adventurous offerings.

I’ve seen some stuff about Surfer’s Coffee in Wahiawa (including that it might be run by a cult? which definitely adds a little… something).

Not really looking for Kona, I’ve found it tends to work better roasted a bit darker than I usually prefer. That said, I’ve never had the chance to try Ka‘ū or other high elevation grown coffees (3,000 ft+), and I’d definitely be game for that kind of thing.

Totally open to roasters on other islands too (which is why I’m asking here instead of r/Oahu), especially if they offer shipping or subscriptions. Would love to support local roasters doing cool things here in Hawai‘i.

1lhp1q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1lhp1q2/my_cat_has_raptured_cruciate_ligament_twice_now/,"My cat has raptured Cruciate Ligament twice now, and we are at our wit's end","**Species**: Cat  
**Age**: 7  
**Sex/Neuter status**: Male (neutered)  
**Breed**: British Shorthair crossbreed  
**Body weight**: < 4.7 kg  
**General location**: Netherlands

A bit of background: we adopted our cat a few years ago. He is not an outdoor cat and is generally very friendly and chill. He’s always had a weird behavior we’d never seen in a cat — after pooping, he gets extreme zoomies. He runs up and down the stairs and jumps around the house sometimes throeing himself at the window ledges (from inside) at speed. The previous owner said she had never observed this, but we just learned to live with it... until March of last year.

During one of his sprints, he missed the ledge and fell. We knew something was wrong — he was meowing in pain and limping. Long story short: we took him to an orthopedic vet and learned he had ruptured his cruciate ligament in the knee and needed surgery.

The surgery went well. From what I understood, they also saw that the meniscus disc was damaged. They installed a prosthetic band where the ligament should be and told us he couldn’t jump or run for about  8 weeks. As you can imagine, the recovery period was hell. How do you restrain a cat for 8 weeks? At first, he was okay sleeping in a bench, but as he improved, he wanted to jump on the bed and sofa like he usually did. Whenever we tried to stop him, he became more and more annoyed — even depressed. Luckily, he recovered.

Soon, he was back to sprinting up the stairs during his zoomies — and my biggest fear came true.

A few weeks ago in May, we woke up and found it strange he wasn't in bed with us. He was badly limping and clearly not behaving like himself. We took him to the vet and found out that, during the night, he had ruptured the cruciate ligament in his **other** knee. The vet said this kind of thing is common in dogs — in 70% of cases, when one knee is operated on, they’re back for the other within two years.

So we had to take him in for surgery again, and our nightmare began anew. On May 15th, he had his second knee surgery, and prosthetic bands were installed again. Recovery seemed to be going well — until, during a moment of distraction, he jumped on the sofa. Since that jump, he’s been limping again. It has improved slightly, but it’s clear he’s not recovering smoothly, so we took him back to the vet.

Our worst fears were confirmed: the vet noticed his knee wasn’t as stable as expected. He recommended we wait a bit longer, but he only gives it a 50% chance of healing without further intervention. Ultimately, we may be facing another surgery, as the prosthetic bands may no longer be in place.

We’re going crazy. Financially, this is a massive burden. On top of that, we can't leave him alone for long — which means months of logistical gymnastics to ensure someone is always with him. Even then, it’s extremely hard to manage. He’s getting grumpier because we won’t let him go where he pleases. We’ve rearranged our living room and keep our furniture permanently covered, but this is taking a huge toll on our mental health. We can’t even go out for a coffee together. Maintaining our jobs has become challenging. My partner and I take turns sleeping in the living room with him to keep an eye on him.

Finally, I’m really worried about our cat’s quality of life. He’s clearly not enjoying this. He doesn’t purr anymore. And there’s still a chance he may need a **third** surgery and another long recovery. He’s only 7, and I’m already concerned about what his senior years will be like. Will this ever get better? Or is he going to end up with two bad hind legs as he ages — in pain? God forbid, could he injure his knee again? We can’t keep doing surgeries every year.

We’re at a loss and I feel hopeless and full of anxiety. I guess I’m looking for professional advice or insights from people with similar experiences.",7,1750602085.0,AskVet,10,0.89,False
1lhoznk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioLandlord/comments/1lhoznk/illegal_sublet_and_rent_gouging/,illegal sublet and rent gouging,"hi !
I have been in my apartment in Toronto for 8 months now. We are subletting the place from a guy who is away for two years. There have been so many issues off the bat with him as our sublandlord (I listed them below) but now we don’t know how to proceed. 

First, we realized that this was an illegal sublet because of the two year lease term we signed that he drafted up. Which makes us think the landlords also didn’t approve it. 

We decided to take the chance three months ago and in writing let the landlords know that we are subletting this unit. They didn’t respond nor did we receive any eviction notice for illegally occupying the unit within 60 days of that. 

Recently, a paper got slipped under our door telling us that rent is increasing. The caveat is that it’s 600$ less than what we are paying our sublandlord. When we moved in he also took first, last and a damage deposit (3 x the monthly rent). And he also left EVERYthing in the apartment except his clothes when he left it for us … I mean tax papers, journals, coffee grinds in the machine, garbage bins full.. we have been paying for a unit to store his shit. He was dumbfounded we were upset about having to live amongst his things and when something is furnished it’s just furniture. We also read that he can’t charge more even if it’s furnished based on a few case law and advice online. 

How do we go about getting this money back? It’s now over 6000$ he’s basically scammed us out of. We know tenants pay only hydro here so I know that’s not enough to cover that... A strongly worded email? Should we just go to the TLB? Small claims court? We don’t have the money for a lawyer and also the local legal office said they don’t help tenant v tenant disputes even though I explained I thought he would be considered landlord under the act.

2 - Journey began with a splash in Lake Kovd. :/

3 - Made it to Imandra!

4 - Convoy is crossing the ice lake south of the airfield.

5 - A deserved rest and fill-up with fuel and hot coffee at the airfield.

6 - Every one is stuck!

7 - Finally, convoy arrives at destination! :D

8 - Our tired heroes assemble for group photo, before going back to garage again.

  
The Tuz-16 is a new favourite of mine. Long logs in rough terrain is too much for it, but it is having fun either way! :D

ZikZ was better than I thought it would be. Step was up to this challenge and was a dependable runner!

I think he was a bit drunk yesterday, he barely remembered what he said and the way he acted, and he passed out in the other room before I went to sleep, so I was safe.

Today we re-packed his things together, took some stuff to a small storage space so he can come get it next month when he moves to a more permanent location, sat down and chatted as we drank some coffee, hugged goodbye, and that's it. I got teary-eyed during the hug, but haven't cried. 

Now what do I do with myself? I have a dinner in 5 hours, and I don't feel like cleaning today, though I desperately need to do it tomorrow. I called my mom, saw my grandma, and still have 2 people to call, but I don't feel like talking to anyone. I'm nervous and angry, and I don't know what to do with it. 

I'm thinking maybe I should just have a glass of wine and draw myself a bath, wash my hair, do some skin care and all that. Is this qhat I should be doing? If anyone knows what should be my next steps, please tell me. 

My plans for the week are to:

• clean the house
• change the locks
• calling the company that fixed my window to finish the job (there's a rubber that needs to be changed)
• finish fixing one of the walls
• going to the store to buy paint for the walls

Is this enough? Should I look for therapists, groups, or something? How do I stop being in a constant state of fear, like someone's watching me? He's gone, so I shouldn't feel this way anymore, right? 

Sorry if this is confusing, I'm just trying to make sense of the weird emotions I'm feeling. I thought for sure I'd cry. I don't know. I also want to thank everyone for their support, I probably would have tried to make it work if it weren't for you guys. ",3,1750601761.0,abusiverelationships,2,0.81,False

I just got into a conversation with my husband about how he didn’t really do anything special for my bday which fell on a weekday. So I thought the specialness would happen on the weekend - and i’m just disappointed.

1. I took my actual bday off, knowing that he probably wouldn’t do anything and realizing I could make it special myself. I did have a nice day.

2. My mom made my cake. I made my own bday dinner bc my husband was expecting me to grocery shop on my actual Birthday and I didn’t have the time nor desire to- so we had leftovers from the day before.

3. He got me a card but no actual present. I had asked for one night away. I planned it and guessing i’m paying for it. My parents had given me a check to apply to it.

4. He said he was going to make me a special breakfast on the weekend and never did.

5. I asked to sleep in on one weekend day to drink coffee/read a book. Then he barges is saying it’s done, as he gets ready to go to the gym. Saying I got an hr longer than he did when he got to sleep in.

6. So what did he do? He did make a reservation for a farm-to-table dinner. Which yes, is awesome but something we both get to appreciate right? It just doesn’t feel special. I mean, it does but it’s something that mutually benefits us. 

7. My love language is Acts of Service. I talked with him abt my disappointment. How something as small as letting me sleep in, having it be his idea and making my coffee the night before would mean so much. Planning, grocery shopping and making the dinner - not having me do a part of it.
