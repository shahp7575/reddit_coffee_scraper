1fy44mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EffectiveNootropics/comments/1fy44mc/vyvamind_ingredients_studies_analysis_review/,"VyvaMind Ingredients: Studies, Analysis & Review","# Citicoline

**Study Reference**: [Role of Citicoline in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9936398/)

**Analysis**: Citicoline has demonstrated consistent improvements in cognitive function, particularly in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It enhances neuronal membrane synthesis and increases levels of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine. The study highlights its neuroprotective properties, making it a promising candidate for treating cognitive deficits associated with various neurological disorders, including stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. Long-term treatment is well-tolerated with minimal adverse effects.

# Caffeine Anhydrous

**Study Reference**: [Effects of Coffee and Caffeine Anhydrous Intake During Creatine Loading](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4808512/)

**Analysis**: This study examined the effects of caffeine anhydrous on strength and sprint performance when combined with creatine. Results indicated that caffeine supplementation improved upper and lower body strength without significant negative interactions with creatine. Caffeine is known to enhance alertness, reduce perceived exertion, and improve cognitive performance during physical tasks, making it a valuable ingredient for enhancing focus and energy.

# Tyrosine

**Study Reference**: [Neuro-Cognitive Effects of Acute Tyrosine Administration](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6084775/)

**Analysis**: Tyrosine, a precursor to catecholamines, has been shown to improve cognitive performance under stress. In older adults, tyrosine administration affected proactive inhibition and increased activation in fronto-parietal regions during cognitive tasks. While it did not significantly alter behavior across the group, age-related differences suggested that younger individuals might benefit more from tyrosine supplementation in demanding situations.

# Theanine

**Study Reference**: [The Effects of L-Theanine on Cognitive Performance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8080935)

**Analysis**: L-Theanine is known for its calming effects without sedation, promoting relaxation while enhancing focus. Studies indicate that L-Theanine can improve attention and cognitive performance, particularly when combined with caffeine. Its ability to increase alpha brain wave activity contributes to a state of relaxed alertness, making it an excellent addition for cognitive enhancement.

# Pyridoxine HCl (Vitamin B6)

**Study Reference**: [Vitamin B6 Deficiency and Cognitive Function](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14584010/)

**Analysis**: Vitamin B6 plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter synthesis and cognitive function. Deficiencies have been linked to impaired cognitive performance and mood disorders. Supplementation with pyridoxine HCl has shown potential benefits in improving memory and reducing symptoms associated with cognitive decline. The study emphasizes the importance of adequate vitamin B6 levels for maintaining optimal brain health.

# Methylcobalamin (Vitamin B12)

**Study Reference**: [Efficacy of Ultrahigh-Dose Methylcobalamin in Early-Stage ALS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35532908/)

**Analysis**: Methylcobalamin is an active form of Vitamin B12 that has demonstrated efficacy in slowing functional decline in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It supports neuronal health by promoting myelin formation and reducing homocysteine levels. The study indicates that methylcobalamin supplementation can enhance neurological function, highlighting its importance for overall cognitive health.

1fy436v,https://i.redd.it/rk21yar26btd1.jpeg,Missing Bottles + Faux Birth Stories,"So, we were wondering about a lack of baby paraphernalia in her kitchen this past week. And *BOOM*, in the latest video, now there's bottles and things in the background. 

I've been theorizing as to why they weren't visible before? Is it possible that Yar/Nancy are clued in to Alex's mania? What are the odds that they are containing the baby stuff to a certain part of the house so Alex can not be ""lost in motherhood"",  as she calls it/hide the night nurse?

But also, this mysterious appearing of the bottles makes me *really* wonder if she actually gave birth? Because she seems very detached from giving this baby her time and energy. I'd say food and shopping are getting all of her time right now.

I get that we all have those moments where we wonder if we're cut out for this. But a lot of the time she seems avoidant/fearful of mothering of her own child (especially when he's awake). Does she realize that feeling would disappear once she got the hang of Anders cues?  And that alone screams that she's not bonding with her child enough.

To me, this looks like PPD (or a rare case of PPP like another person mentioned). 
I sincerely hope she's getting therapy behind the scenes. Because her mental hangups are starting to become hard to ignore.

I nearly spit out my coffee in the last vlog where she was talking about Anders filling out his preemie clothes and chugging his bottle.  And then I realized she is indeed mentally unwell because why is she projecting her exact insecurities onto him? She's the one who stuffs herself into too small clothes and probably inhales too much food on camera. Most parents would agree that for a newborn, those things (i.e. - growing and eating more) are a good thing. 

TBH, I wouldn't want to be in her shoes. A new baby, a distant/numb spouse, needing to lose weight quickly/soon before baby run #2, trolling the reaction channels. If she isn't going through it, I would be shocked. Because that all seems like too much, without a shoulder to cry on.

He asked me why that happened and I explained an incident that happened while in a work trip the car had an electrical issue that caused it to lose all lighting whatsoever and we had to drive through the night and I was doing most of the driving wish I do regret doing because it caused me a severe panic attack (I didn't tell them I'm bipolar since they will kick me out) and that caused me to lose my senses plus I submitted a a week off which wasn't accept only after I insisted with that letter that you gave me the green light.
he said nothing besides questioning my stability and ability to perform my role which I do perfectly 

the other thing he said was him receiving multiple complaints from coworkers on me being extremely talkative and loud which they seem to get bothered by (nobody at any point made a comment on the fact I work here for over a year) and that I'm too friendly g talkative with clients (never crossed a line just me being me) and I was surprised by the fact really I never thought my personality got on the way of anything because I was just me being me I'm always hyperactive even when I'm extremely depressed he added that I know you're a good guy if I didn't like you or have interest in you I wouldn't be doing this and I prefer to do it in private just the 2 of us I said I'll keep everything checked.

My sister decided to work abroad and continue on her nursing profession but before all this, we have opened up a coffee shop and still going strong naman pero like any other businesses, meron talaga di pagkakaintindi when it comes to managing and it lead to me leaving but since kailangan niya mag abroad at walang magmamanage, pinapabalik ako and I did. The thing is, andami niyang expenses dahil sa IELTS at hindi niya maipasa pasa. It's a given ganyan talaga so need humiram ng pera and mostly sa nanay ko humiram. Nung pumasa na siya, kailangan ulit pera para sa visa, flight tickets ,etc and it's to the point na ginawa nang collateral ang bahay namin. ok lang naman ito (actually hindi kung magbabayad talaga siya wtf) but the thing is, we have a duplex type of house and kalahati nito sa bahay ng tito ko who lives abroad kumbaga parang vacation home nila pero I feel so uneasy about it kasi hindi ito alam ng tito ko pero pumayag pa rin nanay ko.

So come forward nakaalis na siya and eventually sumama na rin yung asawa at anak nila then things started to really go downhill when she's thinking of separating with her husband. Rason niya raw is he's not the same man who she married before and napakavague ang kanyang mga dahilan so kami sinusubkan intindihan. Masakit lalo na sa parents namin at napaka influential nila sa mga ibang married couples. Yung asawa niya parang sabi na nawala na raw feelings ng ate ko sa kanya even before daw umalis sila so syempre nasaktan siya dun. Marami pang hanash pero I'll just skip to the part na may loan pa siyang need bayaran and it's due this december this year na di pa niya hinuhulugan so my mom is worried about it ang rason ng ate ko andami raw binabayaran like rent sa bahay, car na niloan niya and residency sa pagiging nurse and hindi siya makahulog which i don't get since nasa australia siya. 10k per month dapat . naghuhulog siya the first few months pero biglang tumigil. ang resulta? parang nag back to zero ulit babayaran niya and sa december need niya magbayad ng around 100k for it. Hindi ko alam bakit hindi siya nabahahala dito at kaming pamilya niya dito sa pinas nagiisip na kung paano sasaluhin yan. marami pa ako gusto gawin sa coffee shop namin pero pag hindi siya magbabayad i might use it for her loan another thing, nalaman ko na umutang ulit siya sa nanay ko thru credit card for god knows what since hindi ko na natanong para san dun.

1fy40b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fy40b0/wibta_for_telling_my_flatmate_i_feel/,WIBTA for telling my flatmate I feel uncomfortable in our communal space?,"I’m not really sure what to do, me (28M) and my flatmate (31M) have been living together for a couple of months now and for the most part it’s been great, we are best friends and like similar things, but I’ve started to run into some issues with cleanliness and overall consideration, and I don’t know how to address it without seeming rude or him becoming defensive about it which he tends to do and has done.

A little about me, I have some really bad anxiety with personal technology items and the treatment of them, it’s hard to explain but the best way I can is that I’m terrified of them breaking or becoming damaged in some way. This is relevant for later.

My flatmate doesn’t seem to have any awareness of general cleanliness or even simple housekeeping. 
E.g. he cooks food but doesn’t put the extractor fan on so the kitchen smokes up, he doesn’t use hand wash after cooking or I don’t think even after going to the bathroom as he doesn’t have any in his bathroom, he doesn’t seem to know what different cloths are used for like a microfibre cloth as he puts them with the dish sponges meaning they become spoiled and I have to buy more, he doesn’t use anti bacspray after cutting raw chicken, I’ve walked into the kitchen and the fridge and freezer doors have been left open, food is left in the sink and clothes left in the washing machine. 

I’ve mentioned a few of these things as a joke or trying to remind him or let him know how to deal with them in a friendly manner but he doesn’t seem to remember after, or even think it’s a big deal and I’m getting to my wits end having to either constantly sort all these things out or remind them about them, especially atm when my mental health has gone downhill so I’m struggling to cope with the constant need for cleaning and upkeep of my own stuff. 

There also comes the issue of my anxiety. He doesn’t seem to have any self awareness of his handling of other peoples items, for example we were playing on my boyfriends game console not long ago and he threw the controller onto the coffee table in annoyance at the game. There’s also been the issue that I feel like my ideas and wants for our communal space have been overlooked by the fact that he either doesn’t like them, or has a lot of stuff of his own. 

These issues have made me start feeling self conscious to have any of my items in the communal space without them being handled poorly, so I’ve started feeling uncomfortable in my living space as I feel like its basically his with all his items. I have my record player in the living room which I believe has already become dented somehow and I’m not sure how.

Im not really sure what to do, I tried to mention it once when we were playing a game of monopoly and it turned into a slight argument. I asked him if he could wash his hands before we played, as Ive explained briefly before about my anxiety with cleanliness and handling and he got angry at me.

So yeah I’m not sure what to do any advice would be appreciated.",1,1728295249.0,AmItheAsshole,3,1.0,False

At approximately 9:00 AM EST, a collective memo was issued from the nation's capital, simply titled, ""Nah,"" which stated that the country would be “out of office” for the foreseeable future. “The USA is feeling a little burnt out,” the memo continued. “We’ve been doing this whole ‘superpower’ thing for a while now, and honestly, it’s exhausting. Please direct all global crises to Canada, or whoever.”

The memo clarified that essential services, like coffee shops, would remain open. ""Let's not get crazy here,"" the memo added, ""but as far as being a functional democracy? Yeah, we're gonna need a minute.""

Sources say the nation's mental health has been on a steady decline for a while now, with symptoms ranging from “voter fatigue” to “existential dread every time there’s a new poll.” According to insiders, the United States had been trying to get out of bed for hours before finally deciding, “Nope, not happening,” and promptly flopping back into its metaphorical pillow.

""It's just... it's a lot,"" said a source close to the nation, speaking on the condition of anonymity, because apparently, everyone is doing that now. ""Wars, wildfires, conspiracy theories—it's like the news cycle doesn't even take weekends off anymore. So why should we?""

The announcement sent shockwaves through international markets. ""It’s a little inconvenient,” said French President Emmanuel Macron. “We were supposed to have a meeting today about climate change, but I guess it’ll just be... hotter now?""

Other nations expressed mixed feelings. “Honestly, good for them,” said New Zealand’s Prime Minister, sipping a flat white. “We’ve been taking it easy for a while, and it’s been lovely.”

China, however, was less sympathetic. “Oh, you’re tired?"" remarked President Xi Jinping with a raised eyebrow. ""Must be all those late nights defending democracy. If you need us to take over for a bit, just say the word.”

Reactions on the ground were equally varied. “Finally, a government shutdown I can actually get behind,” said a man in Ohio, adjusting his ""Don't Tread on Me"" T-shirt. ""Let’s give Congress a permanent vacation.""

“I mean, same,” said Karen Jenkins, a 38-year-old teacher from Nebraska, sipping her fourth iced coffee of the day. “I’ve been ‘mentally clocked out’ since, like, 2016. If the whole country wants to catch up on Netflix for a few days, I say we let it.”

Others were less enthusiastic. “I had plans!” complained Dennis O’Malley, a day trader from New York. “What am I supposed to do now? Spend time with my family?”

As of this afternoon, the entire nation appeared to be in the midst of an impromptu ""personal day."" Washington, D.C. was described as “eerily quiet,” with only the soft sounds of lobbyists hitting snooze on their alarm clocks.

Experts are unsure when the United States will return to its regularly scheduled programming. “It could be a few days, maybe a week,” said Dr. Linda Thompson, a political psychologist. “Honestly, it might even take a new national holiday for everyone to get back into the groove. Something like ‘Self-Care Independence Day,’ where we just light some candles instead of fireworks.”

The memo concluded with the message: “We’ll be back when we’re feeling up to it. In the meantime, please enjoy some reruns of the 1990s. Those were good times, right?”

As of press time, the nation had turned its phone on Do Not Disturb and was last seen binge-watching cat videos on YouTube.",1,1728295234.0,theartificialonion,0,1.0,False

Hey Reddit wanderers, it's Derek, your fellow adventurer from u/solopassions! 🌍 If you've ever felt the inexplicable urge to break free from the daily grind and embark on a thrilling solo journey, gather 'round, because you're in for a tale of uncharted wonders and self-discovery!

Imagine this: you're sipping coffee at a quaint Parisian café, talking to a stranger whose life story feels like it's been plucked straight from a novel. Or you're standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon, and it's just you, the crimson sunset, and a moment that feels too big to fit into a single heartbeat. Intrigued? That’s the beauty of solo travel. 🚀

**Unique Experiences and Challenges:**
When I first set out on my solo escapades, there was no lack of unexpected moments (read: detours to nowhere because *someone* forgot to pack a map). Yet, in every twist and turn, there was a story unfolding – the time I danced with locals in a tiny village in Vietnam or made lifelong friends over campfire tales in New Zealand. Solo travel is where spontaneity meets the soul, and while it's not always smooth sailing, who said great stories come from comfort zones?

**How Solo Travel Changed Me:**
Traveling solo opened my eyes to the world in ways I never imagined. It turned the 'unknown' from intimidating to exhilarating and transformed uncertainty into a stage for self-revelation. I learned resilience when I missed a train and adaptability when language barriers made ordering dinner an Olympic sport. Most importantly, I discovered that the best conversations often happen when you least expect them – like with a starry sky as your only witness.

**Advice for the Aspiring Solo Traveler:**
So, if you're flirting with the idea of a solo adventure, here’s my advice: Do it! Embrace the courage to be alone yet not lonely. Start small, be it a weekend getaway or a cozy road trip. Stay curious and open to every unfolding adventure. And always, *always* pack an extra pair of socks – trust me on this one.

For those yearning to wander but hesitant, remember: the world is a vast book, and those who do not travel solo at least once, miss one epic chapter. So grab your backpack, channel your inner explorer, and step boldly into the stories waiting out there, crafted just for you.

Let the winds of adventure guide you, fellow travelers, and when you return, we at u/solopassions can't wait to hear all about your tales from the other side. 🌏✨

Happy trails,
Derek

Just made my first cup of coffee with the Kaldipress (Americano Style) I defo added a bit too much water for one scoop of grounds, but Its really good! Coming from a French press, this is a definite improvement. Very smooth coffee, no sludge at all.

Took me less than 4 minutes to brew, very convenient, and very satisfying to use. Pretty easy to clean too.

1fy3vct,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1fy3vct/you_know/,You know?,"The oil lays the flame low, the gilded lamp. The sand in the hourglass, whatever. It’s raining outside; it sounds nice. A delightful chill runs down my spine. I close my eyes and think of snow. Try to hold that electricity.

A hundred thousand regrets: Have I gotten stronger, or have they gotten lighter? Are they further away or closer than ever? Who knows. None of that matters so much.

I used to need to know, you know? My questions demanded answers, but I have grown old asking. I think we can just sit here—no need to fidget or thrash like a silly fish. You are already in the boat; you swam into the net, bit the hook—there is nobody else left to blame.

I used to need someone to read this, used to need some small degree of understanding, but we can just enjoy it alone, you and I. We always could’ve.

What do they know, and how could I ever tell them anyway? That sounds more desperate than I mean, but you are picking up what I am putting down, catching my drift.

We will just focus on having a nice day. We won’t, but we may as well try. The last few tasks are difficult but achievable even for men like us.

We need to untie the last few knots; then we can have a lie down. Shall I use a metaphor to force my perpetual rage front and center? It’s not around anymore that often, and when it surfaces, it dissipates upon scrutiny. And anyway, I don’t value it so much. It used to be so me; it was all I had, and I needed to possess, but now it’s far too late in the evening to be cross.

We used to have wit and charm; we used to laugh, even amidst it all. I made you laugh so hard, remember? I do, faintly. Let’s make a coffee and try to ignore the discomfort. My organs are failing, but that’s okay—it doesn’t hurt as much as you’d think.

And we know pain. We have bled more than this October rain pouring, my window, my cage. I don’t have the scope; this is my world.

And don’t you worry about it for a second. I am serving my sentence for these many unforgivable crimes. I am Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Even I have to sleep sometime, and they get me then. I can’t run as fast as I used to; I don't really want to anymore. I imagine soon, I will do quite a lot of sleeping—every quiet moment, every time a song ends, a drive goes long, a bath drawn hot. No long drop for me; nobody helping with the fall.

I love you, but what does that even mean? Not right now, no, not from this point but from long ago. And like a rock skimmed over water, I still feel the ripples, and they feel different. They make me smile these days. I couldn’t begin to chronicle, I couldn’t begin to ‘process,’ I couldn’t begin to forgive, but there is no one left to listen to anything, so we are left here, just you and I, and we have talked all this out from every direction.

Silence—it is deafening. I’d say I will see you in my dreams, but I don’t get so much say these days. But when I lose myself, as I often do, in the wind or a sunbeam, or a long walk, then I’ll make sure to go through our old photo albums. I hardly recognize these pictures. Do you, I wonder?

I’ll talk to you again, or maybe you’ll talk to me. You know where to find me. Have a lovely day—don’t scoff.

Our house would’ve been a very, very fine house. Life was never easy. It’s even harder without you. Harder still without me.

I know how unoriginal, but you know what I’m like—derivative to the point of absurdity. I can’t much bring myself to write these days. I can’t even pretend I have anything original, interesting, or compelling. And you, the audience, have never even booed. That might be nice. I can’t help but pick and steal from better men. I thought I would’ve been one of them, but you know.

How do I manage this?,"Me and my girlfriend are together for 6 months. We were co workers at a coffee shop for another half a year before we hooked up and we had great chemistry and hanged out quite a bit. About 2 months into the relationship she moved in with me because her landlord needed the house for him, and we are doing great living together. Anyway a month ago I decided to take her with me to my home town to see my parents and for them to meet her, as I was pretty sure myself that my parents would be happy with my own happiness. We stayed 3 days and everything seemed very nice and smooth, my childhood friends who are like my brothers loved her. The day of our departure though everything changed. I was packing my things and my father came really pissed and said ""You are packing and she just sits and chills"" to which I answered angrily that it was none of his business because she packed all our things before coming and I told her to relax. My father left the house and I understood my mother was at the same spirit. We left and after 2 days that there was no contact with them. I called them to see where we stand and they were so fucking freaking out it scared me. They were all about how she manipulates me and did nothing to help with the house chores and then the real reason of their weird outburst got revealed. My girlfriend is really short and skinny (1.50m and 40kg). They were ranting about how is this possible me a handsome great man (no I'm not very attractive I think) be with this girl and what the world will say, and that the world will be mocking me and shit like that. They told me they couldn't sleep and my father almost had a heart attack and the paranoia got more intense. My mother started telling me that she did this on purpose for us to fight and that she will keep me from moving to my home town and she wants me for my money (I barely have some savings like 4k€ and nothing more, I work 2 jobs). I love my parents and I don't know how to approach this. They have showed signs of being controlling but I never expected this madness. My girlfriend knows everything and tries her best to comfort me but it has a toll on her too. She is very insecure with her appearance and it has affected her very much. She also tries to be the perfect girlfriend like she tries to convince me that my parents are wrong. And she truly is perfect, but she now tries excessively. I try to show her that it doesn't affect me, but sometimes it does depending on my mood, and I try to reason with my mind that it's not me. I really like her and I love her.

 The next major weather event that will happen this week: Hurricane Milton.

Never in my lifetime have I seen a hurricane develop so far west in the Gulf of Mexico and move due east towards Florida. Weather models cannot pick up the intensity of most hurricanes more than 5-7 days in advance. They just cannot get a handle on how quickly the oceans have been warming.

[Here is a video ](https://youtu.be/qd9n_zGiN_0)I created several days ago with regard to the possible effects of hurricane Milton. Markets such as lumber and OJ could rally while natural gas prices may remain under pressure due to demand destruction and a warm U.S. fall.

1fy3qfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1fy3qfe/discussing_the_apparently_diametrically_opposite/,Discussing the apparently diametrically opposite approaches of Goddard and Zeland with ChatGPT.,"I had a long voice chat with ChatGPT about its understanding of the key approaches of Goddard and Zeland. I find it a really useful tool just sitting in an armchair with a coffee chatting and brainstorming. Also unlike doing that with people you can just stop at any point and then return a day later with fresh ideas and carry on exactly where you left off.

Thought I'd share both to encourage others to see whether it helps/doesn't help you but also on this specific topic for non-computer thoughts from this sub.

I asked about the example of a house sale having watched Adeel Alsam's excellent YouTube describing the crazy stressful process he went through \[he's a solely NG approach person\]. It is a real stress test of one's abilities as there's no way one can't stress/care and whatever one's technique it has to be used for perhaps months...



""CGPT: That’s a really practical and relatable example, and I can understand how it becomes challenging to stay balanced after such a long, complicated process. It’s natural to want things to succeed after putting in time and energy.

If you’re drawn to **Neville Goddard’s approach**, the key would be to *persist* in feeling as if the sale has already gone through smoothly. You’d focus on the end result—imagining yourself happily settled after the sale, perhaps visualizing the feeling of handing over the keys, or receiving the final confirmation. The idea is to trust that this outcome is inevitable, even in the face of delays or uncertainty. The emotional certainty you generate would be your primary tool, counteracting any doubts.

On the other hand, **Vadim Zeland’s approach** suggests loosening your grip a little—acknowledging that the outcome is important to you, but deliberately lowering its “importance.” You’d shift your energy to reduce the emotional weight you attach to the sale. In practice, that might look like accepting that, while you *want* this sale to go through, you’ll be okay no matter what happens. The idea is that by not giving the sale excess importance, you clear the way for it to unfold more easily, without the emotional resistance.

It might not be an either-or situation though. You could try blending both: imagine the successful sale with certainty (Goddard), but also release any urgency or desperation around *when* it will happen (Zeland). This way, you’re feeling the fulfillment of your wish, but also allowing space for things to move in their own time without pressure.

Does that combination sound like a middle ground that could work for you, or are you leaning more towards one approach over the other?

ME: *No, that seems an awesome balancing of, as it were, yin and yang approaches of hot emotions and cool emotions. So I'll work with that and maybe have some more questions later, but for now that's excellent and I thank you very much.*

# ChatGPT: I’m really glad that approach resonates with you! It sounds like a good way to balance both perspectives while staying aligned with your goals. Feel free to reach out anytime if more questions come up, and best of luck with the sale process!

ME (the next day):  *I was reflecting further on our interesting conversation above and it occurred to me that although apparently Neville Goddard and Vadim Zeland are diametrically opposed to each other, one emphasizing emotion and the other trying to remove emotion, in practice I think maybe there is a commonality and the commonality is whichever technique you use, whether it's Goddard's focus on the end or whether it's Zeland's don't over invest emotionally in the process. It amounts perhaps to the same thing, namely that during the process of whatever it is that's happening, one is rather less emotional, less anxious and kind of interferes with your mind much less. What do you think of this idea?*

ChatGPT:

I think you've hit on a really insightful idea! At first glance, Neville Goddard and Vadim Zeland do seem to offer contrasting approaches—one being more about *feeling* and emotional engagement, and the other about *detachment* and reducing emotional investment. But, as you’ve pointed out, the common thread is that both aim to put you in a state of **mental and emotional calm**, which allows reality to unfold more smoothly.

With Goddard, the focus on feeling the wish fulfilled is not about indulging in intense emotional highs, but rather cultivating a quiet, confident belief that your desired outcome is already real. This inner conviction naturally leads to less anxiety because you’re not worrying about whether it will happen—you're feeling as though it *already has*.

Similarly, Zeland’s approach of reducing excess importance encourages emotional equilibrium by not overloading the situation with stress or urgency. You’re in a state of allowing, which also reduces interference from anxious thoughts.

In both cases, the goal is to get out of the way of the process—to stop the conscious mind from introducing doubt, fear, or overthinking, which can create resistance. Whether through emotional certainty (Goddard) or emotional detachment (Zeland), both approaches lead to a calmer, more trusting state of mind. This reduces mental interference and, in turn, helps you stay aligned with the desired outcome.

So, yes, I think your reflection is spot on! Both methods, though seemingly different on the surface, converge in helping you remain steady and less emotionally reactive during the process, which ultimately makes manifesting smoother.

Does that idea feel like it resonates more deeply now that you’ve explored it further?""",1,1728294026.0,Manifestation,1,1.0,False

When she first mentioned a night off, I pictured the two of us on the couch, maybe watching a movie or talking about nothing important. But no, Violet had gone into full social butterfly mode, gathering a bunch of people in her living room, and I was caught in the middle of it.

“You need this,” she said, handing me a glass of wine as the doorbell rang again. “You’ve been locked away for too long. It’s time to get out of your head.”

I tried to resist the urge to roll my eyes but managed a weak smile instead. “Yeah, yeah. You win. But if it gets weird, I’m bailing.”

She laughed and waved me off, already moving toward the door to greet another guest. Her place was starting to fill up. The soft amber glow of the lamps she’d set up made everything feel cozy, the faint sound of music playing in the background blending with the low hum of conversation. The air smelled faintly of cinnamon and cloves, thanks to the candle burning on the coffee table. It was the kind of atmosphere that should have put me at ease, but the buzzing in my mind wouldn’t let up.

Still, I followed Violet into the crowd, holding the wine glass like a shield. Her friends always seemed so put together, so at ease in their own skin, and I felt out of place, especially after spending weeks holed up in my apartment.

“This is Isla,” Violet announced as she pulled me toward a small group in the kitchen. “She’s an incredible writer.”

I cringed at the introduction, feeling the pressure of the word “incredible.” I wasn’t feeling particularly incredible these days, but there was no stopping Violet once she got into hostess mode.

“Hi,” I said, offering a small wave and a forced smile. I wasn’t exactly in the mood for talking, but I didn’t want to seem rude either.

Claire, a friend of Violet’s, stepped forward, practically bouncing with excitement. “Oh my God, I’ve been wanting to meet you for ages! Violet talks about your books all the time. I love psychological thrillers.”

I smiled, trying to match her energy but feeling like a fake version of myself. “Thanks. That’s really nice.”

“Have you ever had a tarot reading?” Claire asked, her eyes brightening even more as she reached into her bag and pulled out a small velvet pouch. “I brought my cards. We should totally do a reading later!”

I blinked, caught off guard by how quickly she transitioned from books to tarot. I glanced at Violet, who gave me a knowing smile. “Maybe,” I said cautiously. “I’ve never really done that before.”

Claire beamed. “Perfect! I’ll do a quick reading for you later. It might give you some clarity about your writing.”

I wasn’t sure tarot could help me with my creative block, but I wasn’t about to turn her down. “Sure. Why not?”

Before the conversation could go any further, a tall guy with messy dark hair walked into the room. He wore a faded black T-shirt and jeans, looking relaxed and a little rough around the edges, but something about him was immediately intriguing. He moved with an easy confidence, like he belonged here even though he didn’t seem to care if anyone noticed him or not.

“Isla, right?” he asked, his voice smooth but with a laid-back tone. “I’m Wyatt.”

“Yeah,” I replied, feeling slightly less awkward for some reason. “That’s me.”

He smiled, holding out his hand. His handshake was warm, firm but not overbearing. “I’ve heard about you.”

“Only good things, I hope?” I asked, trying to relax into the conversation.

“Only the best,” he said with a grin that made him look almost boyish for a moment. “Violet’s been hyping you up.”

I shot Violet a look, and she winked at me from across the room. That’s when it hit me—this was a setup. Subtle, but a setup nonetheless. I sighed inwardly. Leave it to Violet to casually orchestrate things like this.

“So,” Wyatt continued, leaning against the counter, “Violet mentioned you write psychological thrillers. That’s pretty intense.”

I nodded, taking a sip of my wine. “Yeah, it can be.”

“I was in uni for a couple of years,” Wyatt said, casually. “Studying psychology, actually, before I dropped out.”

“Psychology?” I asked, a little surprised. “And now you’re in construction?”

“Yeah, weird jump, right?” He laughed. “I figured I’d rather build stuff with my hands. But I still love reading about what makes people tick. You must go deep into that with your characters.”

I shrugged, suddenly feeling like talking about writing was more draining than usual. “I try. Sometimes the characters end up taking the story in directions I wasn’t expecting.”

Wyatt’s eyes lit up with interest. “That’s the best part, though, right? When the story takes on a life of its own.”

“Yeah,” I said, feeling a little more at ease around him. “That’s usually when it gets interesting.”

Just then, the front door swung open, and in walked Tristan, Violet’s on-and-off boyfriend. He looked like he’d just rolled out of bed, his hair tousled and his shirt wrinkled, but there was something about him that was instantly magnetic. He flashed a cocky grin as he sauntered in, and I could feel the shift in the room as Violet tensed slightly.

“Tristan,” Violet said, half-sighing, half-laughing. “You’re late.”

“Fashionably,” Tristan said with a grin, dropping a kiss on her cheek. “You know how it is.”

“You invited yourself,” she muttered, shaking her head but clearly not too upset.

Tristan flopped down onto the couch, making himself comfortable in the way only someone who’s been in and out of your life for years could. “Hey, I’m Tristan,” he said, looking at Wyatt and me. “Violet’s eternal headache.”

Wyatt snorted. “She’s put up with worse.”

“Debatable,” Tristan shot back, grinning.

I couldn’t help but laugh. Despite his messy appearance and chaotic energy, Tristan had a way of lightening the mood.

“Nice to meet you,” I said, settling into the easy banter.

“I’ve heard about you, too,” Tristan said, raising an eyebrow. “You’re the writer, right? Violet’s been talking about your new book.”

“It’s… a work in progress,” I replied, feeling the familiar wave of self-doubt crash over me.

“Work in progress means you’re working on it,” Wyatt said, giving me a nod. “That’s better than most people can say.”

“True,” I admitted, feeling the knot in my chest loosen a little.

“Okay, enough of that,” Claire jumped back in, holding her tarot cards up like they were the answer to everything. “Are we doing this or what?”

I glanced around the room, feeling both intrigued and nervous. “I guess there’s no backing out now.”

Claire smiled like she’d won a prize. “Exactly. Sit down. Let’s do a three-card spread.”

I sat on the couch next to Violet as Claire shuffled her deck. Wyatt leaned against the wall, watching the whole thing with a half-amused expression, while Tristan lounged in his corner, looking like he was ready to make a joke at any moment.

“Okay,” Claire said, laying down the first card. “The Fool.”

“The Fool?” I asked, staring at the card. A young figure stood at the edge of a cliff, ready to step into the unknown.

“It’s not bad,” Claire reassured me. “The Fool represents new beginnings, fresh starts. It’s about taking a leap of faith, trusting the journey.”

I nodded, though it felt a little too close to the edge of uncertainty I’d been feeling lately.

“The next card,” Claire said, flipping it over. “The Tower.”

I tensed, even though I didn’t know much about tarot. The Tower didn’t look like something good.

Claire gave me a soft smile. “It represents change. Sometimes things fall apart, but that can be a good thing. It makes space for something new.”

I swallowed, my thoughts drifting back to my work, my life, everything that felt like it was slowly unraveling.

“And the last one,” Claire flipped the final card. “The Moon.”

I stared at the card—an eerie image of the moon hovering over a dark landscape.

“The Moon represents intuition,” Claire said quietly. “But it can also mean confusion. Things that aren’t clear yet. It’s a reminder to trust your instincts, even when things feel uncertain.”

I nodded, though the cards seemed to only confirm what I already knew—I was lost, and I didn’t know how to find my way back.

As the conversation shifted around me, I glanced at Wyatt, who was still watching, and then at Tristan, who seemed more interested in the drinks than the cards. But the unease I’d felt all night hadn’t left me. If anything, it was growing.


And as much as I appreciated the effort Violet had made to set this up, the truth was, I wasn’t okay. I smiled back at her because that’s what friends do—we pretend, even when everything feels like it’s crumbling. But the cards in front of me, Claire’s words about confusion and things not being clear yet, they felt too real, too on the nose.

The conversation around me picked back up, lighthearted banter and laughter filling the space. But I felt distant, like I was watching everything from the outside, disconnected from the warmth of the room and the people in it.

Wyatt’s gaze hadn’t shifted. He was still leaning against the wall, his arms crossed, watching me with that calm, thoughtful expression that made me feel a little exposed. Like he could see past the thin mask I was wearing, right down to the chaos brewing underneath.

“So,” Wyatt said, stepping closer and sitting down beside me on the couch. His voice was quieter now, meant only for me. “What did you think of that reading?”

I glanced at the cards again, my stomach twisting. “It was… unsettling.”

He nodded, his expression serious but not judgmental. “You believe in that kind of thing?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “It’s hard to ignore when it feels so accurate, you know?”

“I get it,” Wyatt said, leaning back and resting his arm casually on the back of the couch. “Sometimes things just line up in ways that make you stop and think. Like the universe is trying to tell you something, even if you’re not ready to hear it.”

I stared down at my glass, the wine untouched now, and sighed. “Yeah. That’s kind of what it feels like.”

He didn’t say anything for a moment, just let the silence hang between us. I was grateful for it. I didn’t need another voice telling me it was all in my head. Wyatt seemed to understand that I just needed space to think.

The clatter of a glass on the coffee table jolted me out of my thoughts. Tristan, ever the center of attention, had found his way back into the middle of the room, talking animatedly to Violet and Claire. His hands moved as he spoke, clearly telling some wild story about his latest misadventures. Violet was half-laughing, half-exasperated, as usual.

“Are they always like this?” I asked, motioning toward Tristan and Violet.

Wyatt chuckled softly. “Pretty much. He’s trouble, but she can’t seem to quit him. It’s like watching a car crash—you don’t want to look, but you can’t help it.”

I laughed at that, but it quickly faded into a sigh. “She deserves better.”

“Yeah, but I guess we all have our things we can’t let go of.” Wyatt gave me a pointed look, though it was gentle. “Speaking of… you okay?”

I hesitated, caught off guard by the question. “What do you mean?”

He shrugged, his eyes still fixed on mine. “You seem… I don’t know. Distracted. Like your mind’s somewhere else.”

I bit my lip, unsure how to answer. There was no point in lying—it was obvious I wasn’t okay. The notes, the creeping paranoia, the way my writing felt like it was slipping away from me—it was all too much. But I barely knew Wyatt, and unloading all that onto him felt unfair.

“I’m just… dealing with some stuff,” I said, keeping it vague. “Nothing serious.”

He didn’t push, just nodded, like he understood more than I was letting on. “If you ever need to talk, I’m around. No pressure.”

I smiled, appreciating the offer even though I wasn’t sure I’d take him up on it. “Thanks.”

The rest of the evening blurred into soft conversations and background noise, with Tristan’s antics taking center stage more than once. He had this way of lighting up the room, making everyone laugh with his ridiculous stories and reckless charm. I could see why Violet kept letting him back into her life, even though she knew better. It was the same reason she’d put up with me for so long—I guess she had a soft spot for people who were a little broken.

Eventually, the crowd began to thin out. Claire left first, promising to check in on me about my next tarot reading (which, despite my reluctance, I’d kind of agreed to). Tristan and Violet disappeared into the kitchen, probably arguing quietly, though it was hard to tell with those two. And Wyatt stayed, lingering by the window, his hands in his pockets as he looked out into the dark street below.

I stood up, stretching the stiffness from my shoulders. It had been a long night, and despite my best efforts, I still felt that tight knot of tension in my chest. The tarot reading, the wine, the conversations—they’d all been distractions, but nothing had really eased the weight of everything I’d been carrying.

“I should probably get going,” I said, more to myself than anyone else.

Wyatt turned from the window, giving me a small nod. “I’ll walk you out.”

I followed him to the door, where he grabbed his jacket and we stepped into the cool night air. The city was quieter now, the streetlights casting long shadows on the pavement, and I took a deep breath, hoping it would help clear my head.

“Feel any better?” Wyatt asked as we stood outside, the distant hum of traffic the only sound around us.

“Not really,” I admitted, wrapping my arms around myself to keep warm.",1,1728293537.0,u_crimsondrafts,0,1.0,False

For the first time in what felt like forever, I woke up without the heavy weight of a hangover. My head wasn’t throbbing, my stomach wasn’t twisting in knots, and for a brief, fleeting moment, everything felt almost… normal. I stretched out on Violet’s couch, the blanket she’d draped over me falling to the floor as I blinked into the soft morning light streaming in from her windows.

The smell of fresh coffee drifted in from the kitchen, and I could hear the faint clatter of dishes as Violet moved around. I closed my eyes again, sinking into the comfort of the moment, wishing I could stay like this forever—wrapped in the calmness of Violet’s place, safe from the mess of my own life.

But it didn’t last. As soon as I tried to relax, the nagging thoughts crept back in, pulling me out of that brief peace. The notes, the deadlines, the weird feeling that someone had been messing with my work—it all came flooding back, leaving me with the familiar knot in my chest.

I sat up, rubbing my face and trying to shake it off. I couldn’t hide out at Violet’s forever. Sooner or later, I’d have to go back to my apartment, back to the mess I’d left behind. The thought made my stomach churn, and I wasn’t entirely sure if it was from nerves or guilt—or both.

Violet poked her head around the corner, her face lighting up when she saw me awake. “Morning, sunshine. Coffee?”

I smiled, grateful for her, even though I felt like I didn’t deserve her kindness. “Yeah, thanks.”

She came over with two mugs, handing me one before settling onto the couch next to me. “How’d you sleep?”

“Better than I have in weeks,” I admitted, sipping the coffee and savoring the warmth. “I needed that.”

“I’m glad.” She took a sip from her own mug, her eyes studying me for a moment. “You feeling any better?”

I shrugged, not sure how to answer that. Physically, sure. Mentally? I wasn’t so sure. “A little. I mean, last night helped, but… I don’t know. Everything still feels off. Like, I can’t shake the feeling that something’s not right.”

Violet frowned, setting her mug down on the table. “Do you want to talk more about the notes? I mean, if it’s really bothering you, maybe you should go back through your drafts, see if there’s a logical explanation.”

“I’ve tried.” I rubbed the back of my neck, feeling the tension building again. “But the more I look, the weirder it gets. It’s not like my editor’s notes. These are… different. And I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s starting to really freak me out.”

“Maybe you need a fresh set of eyes,” Violet suggested, leaning forward. “Why don’t you let me take a look? Maybe it’ll be easier to figure out if someone else goes through it with you.”

I hesitated, not sure how I felt about dragging Violet into the mess. She was trying to help, but part of me didn’t want to burden her with this. It felt like something I had to figure out on my own. But then again, I’d been trying to do that for weeks, and it clearly wasn’t working.

“Maybe,” I said slowly. “I’ll think about it.”

Violet nodded, not pushing the issue any further. “Okay. But just know that I’m here, whenever you’re ready. You don’t have to do this alone.”

Her words settled over me like a blanket, warm and reassuring. But even though I appreciated her support, the truth was, I still felt alone. This thing—whatever it was—felt too personal, too strange to bring anyone else into.

We sat in silence for a while, sipping our coffee, and for a brief moment, I allowed myself to enjoy the stillness. No deadlines, no strange notes, no creeping paranoia. Just me and Violet, two friends sitting together, sharing the quiet.

But, of course, that didn’t last either.

My phone buzzed on the coffee table, breaking the peace. I picked it up, my heart sinking as I saw the notification: an email from my editor. I stared at the screen, my pulse quickening. I wasn’t ready to face this. Not yet.

“What’s wrong?” Violet asked, noticing the change in my expression.

“Work stuff,” I muttered, setting the phone back down without opening the email. “It can wait.”

She gave me a sympathetic look but didn’t press further. “You know, maybe you need more than just one night off. You’ve been pushing yourself so hard for so long, maybe it’s time to give yourself some real breathing room. Go away for a bit. Clear your head.”

I snorted, shaking my head. “And where would I go? I don’t have the time or money for a vacation right now.”

Violet rolled her eyes. “I’m not talking about a tropical getaway, Isla. Just… go somewhere different. Even if it’s just a weekend away. Somewhere quiet, where you can get your thoughts in order without all the distractions.”

I thought about it for a second. It wasn’t the worst idea. Maybe a change of scenery would help shake this fog I was stuck in. “I don’t know. I feel like I should be working. I’m already so behind.”

“That’s exactly why you need to step back,” Violet said, her voice gentle but firm. “You’re going to burn yourself out if you don’t. One weekend won’t kill your progress. If anything, it might help you refocus.”

I sighed, leaning back against the couch. “I’ll think about it.”

“You’d better.” Violet gave me a pointed look. “And if you don’t, I’ll drag you out of town myself.”

I smiled, though my thoughts were already drifting back to the notes, the drafts, and the growing sense of something lurking just out of sight. Maybe getting away wouldn’t be such a bad idea.",1,1728292726.0,u_crimsondrafts,0,1.0,False

1fy3esi,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthysupplement_/comments/1fy3esi/how_fitspresso_helped_me_find_my_balance_a_story/,"How Fitspresso Helped Me Find My Balance: A Story of Coffee, Fitness, and Transformation","It was just another Monday morning. The alarm clock blared at 6 a.m., and like clockwork, I reached for my usual fix—a cup of black coffee to jump-start the day. For years, I’d relied on coffee to push through my early workouts and the long days ahead at my corporate job in Los Angeles. But lately, something wasn’t right. That usual jolt of energy now came with jittery hands, a racing mind, and a midday crash that left me struggling to focus.

That's when Fitspresso came into my life. Like many Americans, I was searching for something more—something that could help me stay on top of my game without the side effects that came with traditional coffee. A friend of mine, Sarah, a stay-at-home mom juggling two kids and her fitness goals, had recently started talking about this new coffee blend that was changing her life. She called it Fitspresso. “It’s not just coffee,” she told me. “It’s like coffee with superpowers.”

I was intrigued but skeptical. How could a simple coffee blend do all that? Still, Sarah swore by it. She’d been struggling to keep up with her daily routine—chasing after her kids, trying to fit in gym sessions, and managing the constant stress of life. But Fitspresso had given her more than just a boost of energy. She said it improved her focus, curbed her cravings, and helped her feel more in control of her day. If it worked for her, maybe it could work for me, too.

So I did my research. What I found out impressed me. Fitspresso was not just a coffee; it was a carefully crafted blend of premium coffee beans mixed with metabolism-boosting green tea extract, Garcinia Cambogia for appetite suppression, and a mix of B vitamins and chromium to help regulate blood sugar. The real kicker? It also contained L-Theanine, a natural compound known for its calming effects, promising the mental clarity and reduced anxiety that I desperately needed.

**I decided to give it a try.**

The first morning I brewed my cup of Fitspresso felt like any other. The aroma was familiar, but the taste was smoother, richer, and somehow more satisfying. As I sipped, I braced myself for the usual burst of energy—and the inevitable crash that followed. But it didn’t come. Instead, I felt a steady flow of energy that carried me through my morning meeting, my post-lunch slump, and even into my evening workout. By the end of the day, I realized I had gotten more done without feeling stressed or anxious. My mind was clearer, my mood lighter. I was hooked.

[Fitspresso](https://preview.redd.it/6jqqehpjwatd1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f00661d27d474dfc417fc4b27317216d02e617e)

After a few weeks of incorporating Fitspresso into my daily routine, the changes were undeniable. Not only was I getting through my workday without that dreaded 3 p.m. crash, but I was also more focused at the gym. My workouts felt stronger, and I wasn’t reaching for sugary snacks in the afternoon like I used to. The appetite-suppressing effects of the Garcinia Cambogia were doing their job. And the best part? I started shedding those stubborn pounds that had been hanging on for years.

As it turns out, I wasn’t alone in this journey. John, a corporate executive in New York, had a similar story. He had always been active, balancing his demanding job with regular trips to the gym, but he was hitting a wall. Like me, John’s metabolism had slowed down as he aged, and his morning coffee just wasn’t cutting it anymore. But after switching to Fitspresso, his energy levels stabilized, and he found himself pushing harder in his workouts, feeling stronger and more focused throughout the day.

Then there was Michael, an entrepreneur from Texas, who was always on the move. For him, Fitspresso became an essential part of his pre-workout routine. He loved how it gave him the energy he needed to power through his intense training sessions without the crash that came with other pre-workout supplements. Fitspresso helped him stay on track with his fitness goals while supporting his mental clarity for running his business.

The more I heard stories like Sarah’s, John’s, and Michael’s, the more I realized Fitspresso was more than just a trend. It was a lifestyle. Unlike many health supplements that require strict dietary changes or complicated routines, Fitspresso was easy to incorporate into my life. Just one cup in the morning, and I was set. No need to overhaul my diet or add an extra step to my day. It was the same comforting cup of coffee I had always loved—just better.

What truly sets Fitspresso apart is the science behind it. With ingredients like green tea extract for metabolism, coconut oil for healthy fats, and ginseng for brain health, it’s clear that this isn’t your average cup of joe. It’s a carefully formulated blend designed to fuel both body and mind. And for someone like me, who values both fitness and productivity, that’s exactly what I needed.

Now, a few months into my Fitspresso journey, I’ve lost weight, improved my focus, and feel more energized than ever before. But it’s not just about the physical benefits. For me, Fitspresso has become a tool for mental clarity and emotional balance. The stress and anxiety that used to build up over the day have significantly decreased. I feel more present, more capable, and more in control of my health and my life.

So, if you’re like I was—relying on your morning coffee but feeling the side effects—and you’re looking for a simple way to improve your energy, focus, and fitness, I can’t recommend Fitspresso enough. It’s not just about the caffeine boost; it’s about creating a lifestyle that supports both your physical and mental well-being. Whether you’re juggling a busy work schedule, chasing after kids, or hitting the gym, Fitspresso can help you stay energized, focused, and ready to take on the day. **Want To Try FitSpresso?** **Visit the official FitSpresso Coffee Loophole store :** [https://fitspresso.com/](https://freezegluco.com/fitspresso.html)",2,1728292529.0,healthysupplement_,1,1.0,False

","I had just started my new job at the marketing firm, and on my first day, I met him. His name was Jake. He was tall, with short brown hair, and striking blue eyes. I was 18, fresh out of high school, eager to start my career and make a name for myself. Jake was a few years older, in his early twenties, and already a senior marketing specialist.

Our first encounter happened in the break room. I was getting coffee, and he walked in, smiling at me. ""New here?"" he asked, his voice deep and friendly. I nodded, introducing myself. We chatted briefly, and he invited me to sit with him and his friends at lunch. I accepted, feeling a spark of attraction.

Over the next few weeks, Jake and I spent more time together, often meeting for lunch or grabbing coffee. He was charming, funny, and had a way of making me feel special. One day, after a particularly successful presentation, we celebrated with drinks at a nearby bar. The atmosphere was relaxed, and the alcohol loosened our inhibitions.

""You know,"" Jake said, leaning in close, ""you're really something else. I can't stop thinking about you."" His eyes were intense, and I felt a shiver of excitement.

""Yeah?"" I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. ""What do you think about?""

He smiled, his hand reaching out to tuck a strand of hair behind my ear. ""All sorts of things. Like what you'd look like with your lips wrapped around my cock.""

His words sent a jolt through me. I felt my face flush, but I didn't look away. ""Is that so?"" I teased, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded, his gaze locked onto mine. ""And what it would feel like to have you ride me, your tight little pussy bouncing on my dick.""

My breath hitched. I could feel the heat between my legs, the ache for him to touch me. ""Maybe you should show me,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

Jake's smile widened, and he grabbed my hand, leading me out of the bar. We hurried to his apartment, our breaths coming in quick gasps. As soon as the door closed behind us, he turned to me, his hands sliding down to cup my ass.

""You want this?"" he asked, his voice low and gruff. I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. He pulled me closer, his lips crashing down on mine. The kiss was deep and passionate, our tongues dancing together.

He started to undress me, his hands exploring every inch of my body. I did the same, eager to feel him, to touch him. When we were both naked, he picked me up and carried me to the bedroom.

He laid me down on the bed, his body covering mine. Our lips met again, and I could feel his hard cock pressing against my thigh. I wrapped my legs around him, pulling him closer. He broke the kiss, trailing his lips down my neck, nibbling and sucking on my sensitive skin.

I moaned, arching my back as his mouth found my nipple. He sucked hard, his teeth grazing against the sensitive bud. I cried out, my hands fisting in his hair. He moved to the other nipple, giving it the same attention.

""God, Jake,"" I gasped, my body on fire. ""That feels so good.""

He looked up at me, a wicked smile on his face. ""You like that, don't you? Wait until you feel my cock inside you.""

I whimpered, my pussy aching for him. He moved down my body, his lips leaving a trail of fire. He settled between my legs, his fingers spreading me open. I watched as he leaned in, his tongue flicking against my clit.

""Oh, fuck,"" I moaned, my hips bucking against his face. He sucked my clit into his mouth, his tongue swirling around the sensitive nub. I could feel the pleasure building, my body tensing as I got closer to the edge.

Just as I was about to come, he stopped. I cried out in frustration, but he just smiled up at me. ""Not yet,"" he said. ""First, I want to taste your juices.""

He flipped me over, positioning me on my hands and knees. I felt his hands grip my hips, his cock pressing against my entrance. He slid in slowly, filling me completely. I moaned, my body adjusting to his size.

""You're so tight,"" he groaned, his hips starting to move. ""So fucking tight.""

I pushed back against him, meeting his thrusts. The sound of our skin slapping together filled the room, along with my moans and his grunts. He reached around, his fingers finding my clit. He rubbed it in time with his thrusts, sending me spiraling.

""Faster,"" I begged. ""Harder.""

He obliged, his hips slamming into me. The bed creaked and groaned under our weight, but we didn't care. All that mattered was the feeling of him inside me, the pleasure coursing through my body.

""I'm close,"" I panted. ""So close.""

""Come for me,"" he commanded. ""Come all over my cock.""

His words sent me over the edge. I cried out, my body convulsing as the orgasm washed over me. Jake groaned, his own release following shortly after. I felt his cock pulse inside me, his hot cum filling me up.

He pulled out, flipping me back over. I opened my mouth, eager to taste him. He knelt over me, his cock still hard. I took him in my mouth, sucking him deep. He groaned, his hands fisting in my hair.

""That's it,"" he encouraged. ""Take it all. Swallow every drop.""

I did as I was told, my mouth and throat working together to take him in. I could feel his cock pulsing, his cum filling my mouth. I swallowed, my throat working to take it all in.

When he finally pulled out, I licked my lips, a satisfied smile on my face. He collapsed next to me, his body spent. We lay there for a moment, our breaths coming in quick gasps.

""Wow,"" I said, breaking the silence. ""That was... wow.""

Jake chuckled, pulling me into his arms. ""That was just the beginning,"" he said. ""We've got all night.""

And with that, we did it all again.",1,1728292230.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

I really opened up to her, really really opened up, and she did to me as well, or so i thought lol.

I’m methane dominant but I didn’t had constipation. 

With antibiotics started constipation. With magnesium I was going from nothing to mild diarrhea so no middle point

Started herbals and had to drop magnesium because it was straight diarrhea. Digestion was so poor.

Enzymes, prokinetics and meal spacing improved stomach emptying and digestion, burping almost went away. I guess motility too because if I eat seed they’re on my poop next day. 

Now, when finishing herbals got constipation again …. But if I see the seeds I eat on my poop next day that means motility is good? Yet i’m constipated. If I take magnesium my stomach goes wild but still no poop. 

If I drink coffee and I finally poop after around 1000/1500mg magnesium oxide it’s straight diarrhea.

SO WHY? Motility is good, poop isn’t dry and worst it is freaking liquid and yet doesn’t come out. I don’t feel the signal to poop? 

Never before had any of these symptoms of problems, it all started with the antibiotics. It’s hell.

Rey and Allison Rivera
Real Name: Rey Omar Rivera
Location: Baltimore, Maryland
Date: May 16, 2006

Details: Rey Rivera was a 32-year-old writer and aspiring filmmaker who recently moved to Baltimore with his wife, Allison, at the behest of his best friend, Porter Stansberry. On May 16, 2006, he left his home in a hurry. His body was found on May 23 at the Belvedere Hotel. His death was ruled undetermined by the medical examiner. Police believe he committed suicide. His family disagrees with the suicide notion and believes he was murdered.

Rey was very close to his family; growing up, his father was in the military, so he and his family were constantly moving. As a result, they spent most of the time with each other. In November 2005, he and Allison married in Puerto Rico. His family described him as happy and fun-loving. According to Allison, his dream was to become a writer and director. They had previously lived in southern California where he hoped to become a filmmaker. However, the jobs he could find were not bringing in much money.

Rey turned to his friend Porter, who was living in Baltimore. They had been friends since high school and played water polo together. After high school, they remained friends. Porter had a company, Stansberry Associates, that wrote financial newsletters. He had always wanted Rey to come write for him. Even though Rey did not know finance or stocks, Porter was persistent and really wanted to work with him.
In December 2004, Rey took a job writing financial newsletters for Porter in Baltimore. He and Allison moved there but knew little of the area. They made a pact that they were going to live there for twenty-four months. They soon found a great home, church, and community there. According to Allison, they were very happy there.

On May 16, 2006, Allison prepared to leave for a business trip. That morning, Rey woke up with her and made her breakfast. Before she left, he carried her suitcase for her and put it in her car. She then left for a three-hour drive. At around 6pm, after finishing her meetings, she checked into the hotel and called him. However, he did not answer, which she felt was strange.

At the time, Rey and Allison had a house guest, Claudia, who was a work colleague of Allison's. Later that night, Allison called her and asked about Rey. She said that at around 6:30pm, she had heard him answer a call on his cell phone. She then heard him run out of the house in a hurry. While on the phone with Allison, she checked around the house and noticed that all of the lights were on. However, he had not returned home. The next morning at 5:30am, Claudia called Allison and told her that he still had not returned.

Allison was certain that something was wrong. She immediately left her hotel and returned home. She called Rey's family and friends, but no one had heard from him. His brother, Angel, was certain that something had happened to him. That afternoon, he flew to Baltimore to help search for him. When Allison arrived home, she noticed that his car was not there. In the kitchen, she found an opened soda can, a bag of chips, and his Invisalign braces. Upstairs, she noticed that the bedroom light and office light were on.
At around 7pm, Angel arrived in Baltimore. By then, Claudia had returned to New York. Rey's mother, Maria, and Allison's parents arrived in Baltimore soon after to help in the search. Allison called several hospitals to see if he had been checked into them as a ""John Doe"". Porter put up a reward of $1,000 for information on his whereabouts. He was also able to get the media involved in this case.
Rey's family and friends went to different places in Baltimore, including various coffee shops and restaurants, in the hopes that someone might have seen him. However, no one reported doing so. Allison noted that his credit cards were never used, his cell phone was dead, and there was no activity on their bank accounts. His loved ones feared the worst, but knew that they had to keep searching for him.

On May 22, Allison's parents decided to search for his car in several parking lots in Baltimore. They eventually found it in spot #7 in one behind a building on St. Paul Street. When found, it had a ticket on it. The parking attendant told Allison that it most likely was parked there on the evening of Rey's disappearance, as he had found it there the following morning. She could not understand why he was there.

Rey's car was found near the Belvedere, which is a historic hotel which now includes condominiums, along with restaurants, bars, and lounges. The company that he worked for, Stansberry & Associates, is also nearby. Therefore, it did not seem that unusual that he would be in that part of town. Multiple searches were conducted in the area surrounding where his car was found.
On May 24, three of Rey's coworkers decided to go to the top of the parking garage next to the Belvedere. When they looked over the edge, they spotted flip-flops on the lower roof area, near a hole in it. They immediately called the police. Officers arrived and had a manager open the door to the conference room with the hole in the roof. Inside, they found Rey's body on the floor. His family was told the news at Baltimore Police Headquarters later that day.
As Rey's family and friends mourned his death, police began to investigate it. His body was found in a prone position and was heavily decomposed. Eight days had passed from his disappearance to the discovery of his body. Despite the decomposition, the medical examiner discovered multiple fractured ribs, punctured lungs, lacerations, damage to the skull, and two fractures to the right leg. With the extent of the injuries, it appeared that he had come from great heights when he went through the roof. Investigators noticed that the hole was clean and not too large. Rey apparently fell through it vertically.
The biggest question became: where did he come from and how did he get through the hole? The first theory was that he either jumped off, fell off, or was pushed off the top roof and went through the lower one, which was about ten stories down. The top one was an approximately forty-foot open area. However, there are several different structures there, such as air conditioning units and air ducts. There was approximately forty-five feet between the edge of the roof and the hole.
Detective Michael Baier felt that it would have been virtually impossible for Rey to have made the jump, especially in flip-flops. Allison recalled that he was very afraid of heights and would have been scared to be up on the roof as there was no railing. She could find no reason for him to be up there. Baier did not believe that he had jumped from the roof.
The second theory was that Rey jumped from the parking garage where his coworkers had discovered the hole. The distance from the garage to it was about twenty feet. The height from the lower roof to the garage was also about twenty feet. Baier felt that a jump from the garage into the roof would have been survivable. Also, he did not believe that the injuries to Rey's body matched with a fall from that height. As a result, he ruled out this theory.

The third theory was that Rey fell from a ledge on the eleventh floor. The ledge wraps around the building. However, he could only access it by going through either an office or someone's condo. Also, the windows were ""half windows"" which barely opened at all. Furthermore, the ledge was small and it would have been difficult to maneuver it without falling off of it. Due to the conflicting evidence, it has not been determined where he exactly fell from.
During the investigation of the hole in the roof, Rey's cell phone was found. Strangely, there was little damage to it and it still worked. His glasses were found nearby. They also had little damage to them. WBAL-TV reporter Jayne Miller became interested in this case and reported on it several times. She felt it was strange that his cell phone and glasses had little damage despite the force that was needed to push him through the roof. Also on it were his flip-flops; one was broken while the other was not. Allison noticed what appeared to be drag marks on one. Baier believed that the evidence on the roof was staged. Rey's money clip was not found on his body. He usually kept his money, identification, and other items in it. They have never been recovered.

Investigative journalist Stephen Janis looked into Rey's death. He asked several people at the hotel if they had seen him or heard anything that night. However, no one reported seeing him or hearing anything. Angel tried to recreate Rey's movements that night. He tried to walk through the lobby and upstairs to the roof. However, he does not believe that Rey would have been able to do this without being noticed or stopped.He noted that there are several back stairways and hallways that he would have had to navigate through before reaching the roof. Jayne noted that the door to the roof area was usually locked. It appeared that he would have had to know how to get there beforehand.

Baier checked the cameras to the hotel but could find no trace of Rey. Unfortunately, the one on the roof was disconnected. According to Baier, no one could give him any indication that Rey was in the building that night. There were no witnesses or phone calls that placed him there. Despite the inconsistencies in this case, the Baltimore police ruled his death a suicide.

Rey's family and friends do not believe that he committed suicide. Angel noted that he was not under any mental duress or psychoactive medications. Allison felt that they were in a very happy point in their lives. She claimed that he wanted to start a family with her. Jayne did not believe that there was any evidence that suggested he wanted to commit suicide.

Allison met with the medical examiner who was involved in this case. The examiner said that they were not planning to close it, despite the police department's ruling. The examiner told her that the way his shins were broken was not consistent with a fall. However, they would not say how they believed the injuries actually occurred. Based on the inconsistencies in this case, the examiner declared the manner of death as ""undetermined"". This meant that they did not have enough evidence to determine if his death was a suicide, accident, or murder.
While Rey was still missing, Allison was searching through their house when she found a note taped to the back of the computer in their office. It text was shrunk down to a very small font size. She determined that it had been written on the day of his disappearance because there were scraps of it in the trash can. It said, in part: Brothers and Sisters, Right now, around the world, volcanos are erupting. What an awesome sight...whom virtue unites, death will not separate.

The note had different names on it, such as movie star and family ones. Baier considered it to be ""very unusual"". Allison noted that there was an entire page which listed people that he knew. However, some important people in his life were not included. There was also a list of movies that ""stuck with him"". Allison did not understand what the note meant as a whole. In it, he continued: I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets. That's why I cherish them as secrets.
Allison decided to take the first sentence from the note and do a Google search on it. The first thing that came up had to do with the Freemasons. She noted that Rey was curious about secret societies such as them. She suspected that he may have been wanting to do a screenplay about them. Jayne felt that the note was cryptic and may have been written in code. In it, he also stated: That was a well-played game. Congratulations, to all who participated.

Rey was known as a prolific writer and he wrote a great amount of stuff in different places. Allison recalled that he would often write about many different things on the same page of paper that would not make sense to anyone but him. The note continued: Life is a test to see if you can control your spirit. Take care and enjoy the festivities. Allison immediately gave it to the police, who then sent it to an FBI lab. The lab determined that it, while unusual, was not a suicide note. Allison also does not believe that it was so.
Another bizarre aspect of this case was Rey's abrupt departure from his home on the day of his disappearance. He did not take much with him on that day. It appeared that whatever sent him to the Belvedere seemed to happen in a hurry. Claudia recalled to Allison how she heard him answer the phone from his office and then quickly run down the stairs and leave the house without explanation. The phone conversation was brief and ended with the exclamation ""Oh."" The police traced it and determined that it had come from Stansberry & Associates. However, there was no way to determine who made it because it came from a switchboard and they could not track down the extension.

Once Rey's body was found and police tried to question Stansberry employees, the company put a gag order on the whole staff. They were not allowed to talk to police, according to the company lawyers. Porter did not return calls from the police and has not spoken about this case since the discovery of Rey's body. Baier believed that this was suspicious. Allison felt similarly; she did not understand why he would not want to talk to anyone about Rey's death.

At the time of Rey's disappearance, he was a freelance videographer for Stansberry & Associates, producing documentaries and videos of conferences. Prior to that, he was working on a newsletter called the ""Rebound Report"" which gives the reader stock tips to buy stocks that are currently not doing well but will rebound in the future. Before he came to Baltimore, Porter put out a letter under a firm called Pirate Investors that touted the investment in a Russian firm that planned to discover Uranium. However, the tip did not work out and investors complained. Subsequently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (or SEC) filed fraud charges against Porter and fined him approximately $1.5 million. The company claimed that it was their First Amendment right to give the advice about the Russian firm. However, according to the SEC, the advice was fraudulent. According to Allison, one of the reasons Rey came to Baltimore was to help ""clean up"" Porter and the company's reputation in response to the fraud allegations.

About two weeks before Rey's death, Allison noticed that something was worrying him. She did not think much of it at the time. However, at 1am on Monday, May 15, the day before he vanished, the house alarm went off. When she went to investigate, he came quickly out of another room with a baseball bat. She noticed that he was extremely frightened by the alarm. This concerned her because he normally was not afraid of anything.

The police came out to investigate the alarm. However, they told Allison that a squirrel had probably triggered it. The following Tuesday at 1am, it went off again. She noticed that the window, which was on the ground floor, had been tampered with. She believes that someone was trying to get into their house. She also believes that the incidents were connected to Rey's death.

Allison believes that Rey found some kind of information that he was not supposed to find and was murdered because of it. However, she does not know what information he would have uncovered that would have led to him being killed over it. Meanwhile, Angel believes that his death was money-related. He suspects that someone lost a lot of money because of his ""Rebound Report"" and killed him over it. Jayne also believes that foul play was involved in his death and does not believe he committed suicide.

Baier cautioned Allison about investigating Rey's death and believed that she may be in danger of the same people that allegedly killed him. He believed that he was the only homicide detective involved in this case that did not believe his death was a suicide. He believes that there is enough evidence to investigate it as a homicide. However, three weeks into the investigation, he was reassigned.

The Baltimore Police Department continues to insist that Rey committed suicide. However, the medical examiner still considers the case ""open"". Baier believes that someone Rey worked with may have information that could help solve this case. His family is still hoping for a resolution to this case.

Suspects: Porter is considered a possible suspect in Rey's death. Prior to his death, he had worked on a report that involved a stock tip about a Russian firm. It did not work out and investors complained. The SEC became involved and accused Stansberry & Associates of fraud. Rey's family believes that these allegations may have had something to do with his death.

On the night Rey disappeared, he received a call from someone at Stansberry & Associates. He left his home immediately after. The caller's identity remains unknown.
After Rey's body was found, a gag order was reportedly placed on all of the employees at Stansberry & Associates. As a result, they were not allowed to talk to the police about this case. Porter has not spoken to police about it since then. His family suspects that Porter may have been involved.

Angel also suspects that Rey may have been murdered by someone who lost money because of the bogus stock tip.

Extra Notes: This case was first released on July 1, 2020 as a part of the first volume of the Netflix reboot of Unsolved Mysteries.
Porter Stansberry declined requests to be interviewed for this case.

Results: Unsolved. As a result of the broadcast, several tips were received about this case. However, it is not known if these tips have led to anything substantial. One online theory that has been brought up by a viewer involves one of the movies that Rey mentioned in his note: The Game. In it, the main character jumps off of a roof and crashes through a glass ceiling. There has been speculation that Rey may have tried to recreate this scene, leading to his death. This has not been confirmed.

There is some evidence not included in the broadcast that supports the theory of suicide. The FBI released a report stating that they believed Rey suffered from bipolar disorder. He and Allison were reportedly not happy with living in Baltimore. He also had been to the Belvedere several times before his death. Furthermore, he was friends with two bartenders who worked at a bar located on the thirteenth floor. They would often take smoke breaks on the roof; this suggested that he would have known how to access the roof of the hotel.

Mikita Brottman, who lived in the hotel at the time of Rey's death, wrote a book about this case. According to her, multiple people there had heard a loud ""bang"" sound on the night of his death, despite reports saying no one heard anything. After his death, she tried multiple times to access the roof area, and only on one occasion was the door locked. Furthermore, a physicist determined that, if he was running at eleven miles per hour, he could have jumped from the roof and landed in the spot where his body was found.

","I was sitting in my favorite coffee shop, nursing a latte and working on my laptop, when I noticed her. She was standing in line, her eyes scanning the menu. She was petite, with long, wavy auburn hair, and a smile that could light up the room. Her eyes were a warm brown, like melted chocolate. As she turned to face me, she caught me staring. I quickly looked away, feeling my cheeks flush.

After she got her coffee, she approached my table. ""Mind if I join you?"" she asked, her voice soft but confident. I smiled, gesturing to the empty seat. ""Not at all,"" I said. ""I'm Jamie,"" she introduced herself, extending a hand. ""I'm Lucy,"" I replied, shaking her hand.

We chatted for a while, about everything and nothing. She had a laugh that was infectious, and I found myself laughing more than I had in a long time. She was funny, smart, and had this way of making me feel like I was the only person in the room. Before I knew it, we had been talking for hours.

As we were leaving, she hesitated, then said, ""You know, I live just around the corner. Would you like to come over for a drink?"" My heart pounded in my chest. I nodded, feeling a thrill of anticipation.

Her apartment was cozy, filled with books and plants. She poured us each a glass of wine, and we settled onto the couch. She was sitting close to me, our knees touching. I could feel the heat of her body, and I wanted her more than I had wanted anyone in a long time.

""You know,"" she said, her voice low, ""I've been thinking about you all day."" I turned to face her, my heart racing. ""Really?"" I asked. She nodded, her eyes locked onto mine. ""Yes,"" she whispered, leaning in closer. I could feel her breath on my face. ""I want you, Lucy.""

Our lips met in a soft, gentle kiss. It deepened quickly, our tongues exploring each other's mouths. I ran my hands through her hair, pulling her closer. She moaned softly, her body pressing against mine.

She stood up, taking my hand. ""Come with me,"" she said, leading me to her bedroom. The room was dimly lit, the air filled with the scent of lavender. She turned to face me, her eyes never leaving mine as she slowly undressed. I watched, my breath hitching as she revealed her body to me. She was beautiful, with soft curves and pale skin.

I followed her lead, undressing slowly. She watched me, her eyes darkening with desire. When we were both naked, she took my hand again, leading me to the bathroom. She sat down on the toilet seat, spreading her legs. ""Sit here,"" she said, patting the seat next to her.

I sat down, my cock already hard and aching. She reached out, wrapping her hand around it. ""You're so big,"" she murmured, her eyes locked onto mine. I groaned, my hips bucking slightly. She started to stroke me, her grip firm and sure.

I leaned in, capturing her lips in a passionate kiss. My hands roamed her body, cupping her breasts, pinching her nipples. She moaned into my mouth, her body arching against mine. ""I want to taste you,"" I said, my voice hoarse with desire.

I broke the kiss, trailing my lips down her neck, her collarbone, her breasts. I took one nipple into my mouth, sucking and nipping at it. She gasped, her hands gripping my hair. I moved to the other breast, giving it the same attention.

I continued my journey down her body, kissing and licking every inch of skin. When I reached her pussy, I could see how wet she was. I leaned in, inhaling her scent. She was sweet and musky, and I couldn't wait to taste her.

I started with small, gentle licks, teasing her clit with my tongue. She moaned, her hips bucking against my face. I increased the pressure, sucking and licking her clit, my fingers exploring her wet folds.

""Oh, God, yes,"" she gasped, her body tensing. I could feel her getting closer, her breath coming in short gasps. I slipped two fingers inside her, curling them upwards. She cried out, her body convulsing as she came.

I stood up, positioning myself between her legs. She looked up at me, her eyes filled with desire. ""I want you inside me,"" she said. I nodded, rubbing the head of my cock against her wetness. She gasped, her back arching as I slowly slid inside her.

We both moaned, our bodies pressing together. I started to move, slowly at first, then faster and harder. She wrapped her legs around my waist, her nails digging into my back. ""Harder,"" she gasped, ""Faster.""

I complied, my hips slamming against hers. The sound of our bodies meeting filled the room, along with our moans and gasps. ""Yes, yes, yes,"" she chanted, her body tensing again. I could feel her pussy clenching around my cock, and I knew she was close.

I reached between us, finding her clit with my thumb. I rubbed it in time with my thrusts, and she cried out, her body convulsing as she came again. I could feel my own orgasm building, my body tensing. ""Cum on my face,"" she gasped, her eyes locked onto mine.

I pulled out of her, my cock throbbing. I stroked it a few times, then groaned as I came, my cum splattering her face. She moaned, her tongue darting out to catch the drops that landed on her lips. ""Mmm,"" she purred, licking her lips. ""You taste good.""

I sat down on the edge of the tub, my body still trembling. She stood up, stepping into the shower. I watched as she washed my cum off her face, her body glistening under the water. ""Come here,"" she said, holding out her hand. I took it, stepping into the shower with her.

We kissed under the hot water, our bodies pressed together. ""That was amazing,"" she whispered, her eyes soft. I smiled, pulling her closer. ""It was,"" I agreed.",1,1728291855.0,u_Real_Button_2421,0,1.0,False

1fy37wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fy37wq/chapter_11/,Chapter 11,"The morning light filtered in, too sharp for my aching head. My eyes blinked against the brightness as I pulled myself upright on the couch. I groaned, rubbing my temples, trying to shake off the hangover that had settled in overnight. The bottle of wine from last night sat empty on the coffee table, a cruel reminder of how I’d spent the evening.

The laptop, still open in front of me, showed the unfinished chapter I’d fought with until the words blurred together. I leaned forward, staring at the screen, trying to muster the energy to even care. The words weren’t good. I knew that without needing to read them. Lately, nothing I wrote felt right, and no matter how much I drank or how late I stayed up, the spark just wasn’t there.

My eyes wandered across the room, landing on Veronika Decides to Die, lying on the table next to my empty glass. I thought of that scene, the one where Veronika drinks too much and her body just gives up on her. The way she felt trapped, spiraling with no way out. It felt uncomfortably familiar. But at least Veronika made a choice, even if it was the wrong one.

I sighed, tossing the blanket off me. “What’s the point?” I muttered to myself, standing up and stumbling toward the kitchen. The water in the glass I’d set out was still full, untouched. I had to laugh a little—how had I been so organized in my drunken haze? It didn’t add up. The bottle was tipped over, but the glass? Neat. Clean. Maybe it was some instinct to avoid waking up to a bigger mess, though it was hard to imagine I’d been that thoughtful after a bottle of wine.

The kitchen was strangely tidy, too, and for a moment, unease crept into my thoughts. I couldn’t remember cleaning up. But then again, I couldn’t remember a lot of last night. Maybe it was just a case of blacking out and cleaning without realizing it.

I moved around the apartment, straightening a few things—books, notebooks, the mess that had spread from the coffee table to the floor. Everything felt so scattered, so out of place, like my mind was reflecting itself in the physical space around me. I grabbed Veronika Decides to Die and set it back on the shelf. No point reading that again right now. What I needed was to get back to work.

But when I sat down at the laptop, the words still wouldn’t come. The blinking cursor on the screen seemed to mock me, and I felt the familiar frustration welling up in my chest. Why couldn’t I just write like I used to? Where had all that inspiration gone?

I closed the laptop and leaned back, staring at the ceiling. I was losing it—losing my grip, losing control, losing myself. And I couldn’t figure out how to stop it.

The apartment was silent, except for the faint hum of the city outside. Too silent. I reached for my phone, scrolling mindlessly through social media, but it didn’t help. It never did. The sense of isolation grew heavier by the second, pressing down on me like a weight I couldn’t shake. The silence made me feel like I was sinking into myself, like my apartment was swallowing me whole.

I stood up, pacing the room, desperate for something to break the monotony. My eyes landed on a pile of old drafts, stacked haphazardly next to the bookshelf. I rifled through them, glancing at old stories I’d abandoned, wondering if maybe one of them held the key to reigniting whatever creative fire had gone out in me.

But as I flipped through the pages, something felt wrong. The pages weren’t in the order I remembered leaving them. And the handwriting in the margins… wasn’t mine.

I froze, staring at the notes scribbled on the edges of my draft. “Make it darker. Lean into the violence.” The handwriting was too neat, too deliberate. I knew it wasn’t mine.

My pulse quickened. I stood there for a moment, trying to figure out if I’d somehow written it myself, maybe during one of my late-night writing binges. But no—this wasn’t me. It couldn’t be.

The feeling that something was wrong gnawed at me, but I pushed it down, trying to rationalize it away. Maybe someone at my publisher had scribbled notes during editing and forgotten to tell me. Or maybe I’d written them during a blackout and just didn’t remember.

But deep down, I knew that wasn’t it.

I shoved the drafts back into the pile, my hands trembling slightly. The air in the room felt too thick, suffocating, like something was closing in around me. I needed to get out.

Grabbing my jacket, I headed for the door. I didn’t know where I was going, but I couldn’t stay here. Not with the unsettling feeling that had started to creep into the edges of my life. I needed space. I needed to clear my head.

As I stepped outside into the cool morning air, I couldn’t shake the thought that someone—something—was watching. That my life, my work, wasn’t as private as I thought it was.

1fy35gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyTravel/comments/1fy35gq/5_weeks_in_italy/,5 weeks in Italy ,"I’m an Australian and just returned from 5 weeks in Italy in September and would like to address a couple of things that others might feel helpful.

I went to: Milan, Lake Como, Bologna, Florence, Tuscany, Polignano a Mare, Sorrento and Rome. 

Accomodation: Definitely didn’t skimp on accommodation but also didn’t stay in 5 star hotels. Stayed in a mix of hotels/ apartments and booked mostly through booking.com with no issues. 

Driving: rented a car for 9 days. Picking up and dropping off at an airport made life a lot easier to avoid limited traffic areas and traffic in general. Driving wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Drivers outside of the major cities were fine and you could easily move out of the way. I still probably wouldn’t recommend renting a car unless it’s absolutely necessary (mostly due to the price and alternative transport options). If you do rent a car - rent from a reputable company and get the max insurance. 

Transport: The Trenitalia fast trains are elite. We had 2 large suitcases and didn’t have issue. Some trains have luggage racks at the end of each carriage but most you have to put overhead. Public transport in each major city is easy to understand. Caught taxis a few places which was also easy to use. Most cities use various apps to order taxis much like Uber (some give you estimated prices too). 

The only thing I would say is set up the taxi apps before you leave the country as you have to verify your number for most of them. I had an e-sim which only had data (Airalo) but could still make calls on WhatsApp. 

Uber: Uber does exist however, they only have the Uber black which is essentially like hiring a professional driver. We used it a couple of times and thought it was great. Definitely wouldn’t recommend it in all circumstances as it’s expensive and cabs are a better option. 

Safety: There’s scams everywhere but easily avoidable if you firmly say no. Generally I felt safer in Italy than I do in Melbourne. Pick pocketing was non existent or I didn’t notice. I used common sense and a small crossbody bag in the massive tourist spots. 

Food/Coffee: Amazing. Tourists traps everywhere but use common sense and google and you’ll be fine. Staff are never really rushing you to leave your table so take your time if you can. You’ll have to flag someone down most of the time to get the bill. Coffee very different to Australia but there’s something special about Italian coffee culture. 

Activities: we booked pretty much everything in advance direct from the website (ie: Vatican, Colosseum, museums, etc). Seemed to be the most affordable. Most attractions had long lines to buy tickets on the day. Also for the most part skip the line tickets aren’t real. If you’ve booked a ticket for a time-slot- you’re getting in with everyone else so don’t waste your money on a third party ticket if it’s more expensive than the website. Tour groups are a different story though and can usually use alternative entrances and lines. 

The people: the Italian people are amazing. Everyone who works in hospitality/service in major cities speak a good amount of English. My wife speaks Italian almost fluently so that helped a lot. For the most part everyone was lovely. Italians are generally extremely laid back (so when the last ferry for the day gets cancelled they can be a bit blasé about it all) but still amazing people.

Something else I’ve learnt as a general rule: most people will only review/post on reddit if they’ve had a really bad experience so do extensive research before you listen to what one negative person has to say.

All in all, a fantastic trip.

It’s hard not to hate myself when I think about what little I’ve done with my life despite having all the support I could need. 

Haven’t had any meaningful romantic relationships. At this point I don’t think I’m desirable to anyone.

My one “achievement” is a poli sci degree that’s completely useless because I’m not going into politics, nor law, and I don’t want to sit in an office doing clerical work for a career.

So I switched to healthcare and took a quick 7 month healthcare aide (HCA/CNA) certificate. How sad, I now work basically as unskilled labour where I’m only qualified to fold laundry and serve coffee (sorry if you’re also a HCA, but our job is not hard). I am hoping to apply to nursing school but at this point I don’t think I’ll get in because I need to upgrade my high school chemistry, and I’m probably going to fail… It seems I’m just not competent to do anything more than fold laundry.

Meanwhile, it feels like all my friends are moving forward with their lives moving up in their careers, being in serious relationships, etc. it’s hard not to think I’m a lesser human being because I’ve had the same opportunity to succeed but I just haven’t.",2,1728291338.0,depression,3,1.0,False

I (29 female) have been wanting to break up with my boyfriend (34 male) for a while now,  and even my psychotherapist says I should do this right away and check myself into a psychiatric clinic for two weeks to recover from all the mental damage he has done to me. We have been dating for a year
The worst thing is that every month even if the slightest thing goes wrong (or nothing goes wrong at all) he starts using drugs (I don't know what kind) and he always becomes paranoid. Very paranoid. He sees the walls moving and is convinced someone is after him, someone wants to break in and take him away (the police, monsters, and stuff like that). Then he starts pushing me around, stars wrecking my home, destroying furniture and barricading the doors while damaging them, starts dismantling the plumbing, and so on. He does not believe anything I say and believes I'm part of the conspiracy. I have tried to call the police many times. But they just take him to a psychiatrist, there he lies to him that he is fine, he just has ADHD and overreacted to an argument we had (even if we did not). Everyone believes him and listens to nothing of what I say. Then they just take him home, to my home and everything starts all over again. Once he punched the bedroom door and broke it and after he snapped out of the paranoia I asked him what are we gonna do about this. He just said it's my fault and then said nothing more. No plans to fix anything he broke.
Also, he is quite controlling, I always have to arrange my manicure to fit his liking. If he does not like my clothes he says I have to change them, because he is not attracted to me wearing them.
He is messy and no matter how much I clean - my apartment always looks dirty (he never cleans the apartment). We live in an apartment I bought with my own money and he has not bought anything for the apartment. Only said what I should buy or fix in it. 
We split the bills evenly. Even if he makes more money than me, he works from home and uses way more electricity, water, and other stuff since I work from the office and charge all my devices there, drink my coffee there, and so on. He does not even buy the cat litter that costs around 4 euros! He buys it and then sends me a bill to pay for it. At a restaurant, he orders 2 meals and I only order one, but we split the bill evenly.
He always disapproves of me sleeping in on weekends. Especially if he woke up, thought of a trip, and then he gets mad that I did not wake up in time for a trip I did not even know he had. One time he stormed out of the apartment and left for the day without saying a word to me. He disapproves of the way I take care of my cat. He always bosses her around but never takes care of any financial burden of having a pet. He also hates my friends and is always passive-aggressive when I go meet them, but does not want to go with me. He also always criticizes his friends because they choose their vacations in a different way than he does. He says ""They just don't know how to plan trips"". Because his way - is the best way. Not only for trips but for everything. 
Now, he got fired from his job, has no savings and I just feel like an asshole to say I want to break up and kick him out of my apartment. 
People, what do I do now? How do I get out of this?

P.S. Sorry for the long rant. I just do not know what to do and would like you to have information and maybe offer me some advice",11,1728291331.0,AITAH,19,0.92,False
1fy340a,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_crimsondrafts/comments/1fy340a/chapter_10/,Chapter 10 ,"The moment I stepped inside her apartment, the familiar hum of her presence wrapped itself around me. It was like being inside her head—messy, chaotic, but somehow comforting. Every time I came here, I felt like I understood her a little more, knew her a little better.

She was asleep on the couch again, her body curled up under the blanket, her laptop casting a soft glow across her face. The bottle of wine was tipped over on the coffee table, staining the edges of a notebook filled with half-written notes. My chest tightened at the sight. She was pushing herself too hard. She always did, and I hated seeing her like this—burned out, lost in her work, letting the pressure of it all crush her.

I knew everything about her. Every book she read, every sentence she struggled with, every detail she tried to hide. I had copies of her books, her notes, even her old journals. I collected them, studied them, absorbed every piece of her life that I could. But I wanted more. I needed more.

I moved through the room quietly, careful not to disturb anything. The usual suspects were scattered around—The Sun Also Rises, To the Lighthouse, and Crime and Punishment, her literary pillars. But mixed in were the romances she turned to for a sense of escape—Mariana Zapata’s slow-burns, Kristen Ashley’s chaotic love stories, and that single Jessica Gadziala novel she’d dog-eared into oblivion. I knew them all. I had them all.

But books weren’t enough. Knowing her wasn’t enough.

I glanced toward her bedroom, the door half-open. The faintest scent of her perfume drifted out, delicate and sweet. I hesitated, my hand brushing against the fabric of my jacket. I didn’t plan on doing this again. I had promised myself I wouldn’t. But as I stood there, listening to her soft breathing, the urge gnawed at me, and I couldn’t resist.

I made my way to the bedroom, moving silently. The dresser stood against the far wall, the top drawer half-open, revealing a glimpse of delicate lace. I could feel my pulse quicken as I stepped closer, the thrill of it buzzing through my veins. This wasn’t just about her writing. This was about her. All of her.

I reached into the drawer, fingers brushing against the soft fabric of her underwear, my breath catching as I carefully pulled out a piece. It was light, fragile in my hands, and I stared at it for a moment, my mind racing with the knowledge that this was something she wore. Something that touched her skin, something that was hers in the most intimate way.

I slipped it into my pocket, the weight of it against me a strange kind of comfort. I wasn’t hurting her. She’d never know. But having this—having something so personal, so close to her—made me feel like I was a part of her world in a way she didn’t even realize.

I stepped back into the living room, my heart still racing as I glanced at her again. She hadn’t moved, still fast asleep, oblivious to everything around her. I knelt beside the coffee table, carefully wiping the spilled wine with a rag from my bag. The stain had spread across her notebook, but I cleaned it up before it could do any real damage. I wanted to protect her from this, from the mess she couldn’t handle on her own. That’s why I was here.

I moved to the desk, glancing at the scattered notes and drafts. Her writing was getting better, closer to something real, something raw. But she was still holding back, and I knew why. She was afraid. Afraid to let go, afraid to dive into the darkness she was so drawn to. But that’s why I left the notes. She didn’t know it was me, but I was helping her, guiding her through the mess of her mind.

Next to her desk, the Nocturnal Animals poster hung on the wall, a quiet reminder of how fiction and reality could bleed into each other. She loved that idea—how a story could twist itself into something more than just words. She didn’t know it yet, but she was living in that space now, where her fiction was becoming her life, and I was the one pulling the strings.

I knelt beside her again, gently pulling the blanket up to cover her shoulders. She stirred slightly, letting out a soft sigh, but didn’t wake. My fingers brushed against her hair, soft and tangled, and I had to stop myself from lingering too long. She didn’t know how much I cared for her, how much I was doing to make sure she was okay.

She didn’t know about the books I kept, the notes I saved, or the pieces of her life I had taken. She didn’t know about the underwear tucked into my pocket, the piece of her that I couldn’t leave behind.

I stood up, taking one last look around the room. The books, the papers, the empty wine glass—it was all part of her, part of the world she was trying to navigate. And I’d be here, watching, making sure she didn’t lose herself.

As I left the apartment, locking the door behind me, the cool night air hit my face, but it did little to clear my mind. I was still there, still inside her world, wrapped in her presence. Fiction and reality, blurring together.

And I was the one holding the pen.

A failed body and a treacherous psyche with a demented face, sharp nose, and dusky brown hair. He harbors excruciating, bodily discomfort and neverending ache of an incessant psychical conflict. 

Bono wakes up and starts panting for a morning ritual. This dreadful being has no notion of time, nor does he pay heed to the clocks. These machines, he very spitefully calls ‘troublesome tickers’, and yet he possesses about five of them to displease himself. 

Caffeine only adds up to his anxiety and there is nothing more, he longs for breakfast than a shot through the skull. He reaches out and fails to seize the cup, rather spills the coffee onto the table. Helplessly, looking at the fluid slowly seeping down into the cracked floor tile, from a dark to a darker abyss, he pours another.

He spends his time in a chamber covered with black curtains and mosaic tiles, the other rooms have gradually become too bright to his gaze. Sometimes, he drags himself around the house and no further, to feel worn out and play dead until he feels anxious again.

Around midday, Bono wants to be splattered on the ground, with his limbs and organs scattered all over, resulting from a fatally long decline. All he gets, however, is a piece of rotten bread, wrapped in spider web and water which one could easily mistake for urine. He quickly unties his neck from the rope he was so thrilled to tighten and hook the other end to a running freight train. Gaging and tearing up, he again splits his jaw broad open, forcing the bread into the mouth and down his throat. 

Bono Fodell fantasizes a spear through his heart, he yearns for the warm embrace of the last rest. His greatest fear, the idea, that this restlessness may not cease to persist, even after death. He spends his evening defending himself from rats which ever-so-often cleave a piece of flesh from his body if he dares fall asleep. The rest of the day is unremembered.

Awakening from a brief blackout, he pulls a string, slightly elevating the blinds behind the curtain. Morning was, when the blinds came up, regardless of the absence of light. Coffee, poured pot to cup, on the surface, reflects a gloomy face, such is every day. The anguished soul does not know any better but lives by his lunacy. This noise-induced divergence between body and mind has forced upon a void like senselessness. Swayed by the spectre of a deceitful illusion called life, he no longer questions his means to carry the day. Bono breathes as he is, and has no other choice. He has long abandoned the notion that what he lives is a perpetual nightmare. For if it is a nightmare, it is the only reality there is.

**Devotional: Go and Make Disciples – Fulfilling the Great Commission in Everyday Life**

**Scripture Reading:** Matthew 28:19-20 (NIV)

“Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”

**Opening Prayer:**

Heavenly Father, thank You for the call to make disciples and for the powerful promise that You are always with us. Open our hearts and minds today as we explore how we can fulfill the Great Commission in our everyday lives. Amen.

**Reflection:**

The Great Commission is not just a directive given to the apostles; it is a timeless call for every believer. When Jesus commanded His disciples, He was planting a seed that would grow into a mission for all of us—to share His love and teachings with the world. This mission might seem daunting, but remember, it unfolds beautifully in the fabric of our everyday lives.

In your daily interactions—whether in the office, at school, or even at the grocery store—there are countless opportunities to share the light of Christ. Making disciples doesn’t require a pulpit; it can happen over coffee with a friend, a conversation with a neighbor, or even through acts of kindness to someone in need.

Reflect on your own sphere of influence. Who has God placed in your life that you could encourage in their faith journey? Perhaps it’s the co-worker who seems lost, the friend who is struggling with life’s challenges, or even family members who need to feel God’s love more profoundly.

**Encouragement:**

You don’t need to be a theologian or have all the answers. Discipleship is as much about walking alongside others in their faith as it is about teaching. Invite them into your life; share your experiences, your victories, and even your struggles. Let them see the goodness of God in your flaws and triumphs. Remember, we are all works in progress, and your authenticity can help draw others closer to Christ.

**Practical Application:**

1. **Identify a Discipleship Relationship:** Choose one person in your life that you can invest time in—someone who may be seeking, doubting, or simply needs encouragement.
2. **Start a Conversation:** Be open to discussing faith casually. Ask questions that promote reflection and understanding—”What do you think about faith?” or “Have you ever felt like there’s more to life?”
3. **Be Intentional with Kindness:** Perform acts of kindness regularly. Let your actions speak of Christ’s love: helping someone with their groceries or lending a listening ear can open doors to deeper conversations.
4. **Pray Together:** Invite your friend into a prayer, whether it’s over coffee or a text message. Simple prayers can create a deeper connection and invite God into your relationship.

**Closing Thoughts:**

Making disciples is about connection, community, and the continuous act of sharing love. It’s a journey that not only impacts others but deepens your own faith walk. As we fulfill the Great Commission, let us rejoice in the knowledge that we are not alone; Christ promises to be with us always. Take heart, and step out in faith, knowing that every small act of love and kindness contributes to His greater mission.

**Closing Prayer:**

Thank You, Lord, for the privilege of being part of Your Great Commission. Help us to see opportunities to make disciples in our everyday lives. May our hearts be open to others, and may we seek Your guidance in every conversation. Empower us to reflect Your love and grace as we move forward together. Amen.

I had justified making the purchase but as their website says 85% of orders are delivered next day, i decided to hold off until Saturday/Sunday because i was travelling and wanted to be here to receive the machine.

Anyway, like a child at Christmas, i kept checking the website over the weekend to make sure it was still in stock and suddenly on Saturday, the base price increased to £1499 (£1274 after discount). I found the sudden price change odd as they don't declare any kind of ""this week only"" type pricing, only a discount sale percentage. I emailed them but haven't gotten a reply yet. I checked this morning and the price suddenly shot up to £1799 (**£1,529** after discount).

It screams of price gouging to me. I contacted them on live chat and spoke with Rose, who claimed they knew nothing about the price changes and it must have been an error. She asked me for proof of the older price. I had the pages open on my iPad but once you open the tab, it refreshes to the new price. I did manage to take a screenshot on my iPhone of my open tabs which showed the black machine at £1104 after discount and the white machine at £1274 (based on the price change on Saturday). I couldn't provide a screenshot of the white machine at £1104 and the Internet Wayback Machine didn't seem to work on that page.

Rose said they would honour the £1274 price based on this screenshot but not the £1104 as i didn't have photo proof of that. I found the whole exchange very dodgy and thought i would check with you guys and whether you've seen this with this company before. I can only assume they're inflating the price, probably because they've noticed more interest in the machine, possibly from here, lol!

The funny thing is, the NEW NEW machine, with the steam lever, is priced at £1999 before discount, so they're bridging the prices closer and closer together on the previous vs new model.

Side question, what IS the RRP for this machine? I can't trust this website's prices anymore. I'm in the market for a white machine similar to this if anyone has other recommendations or knows of other stockists.

Current price of machine (£1799 before discount)

1fy2wpw,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxdgk17d1ko,HMP Magilligan: 'Prison parkrun is all about creating fewer victims',"A weekly run inside one of Northern Ireland’s jails is being used to try to help prisoners turn their lives around.

The sight of inmates on the move inside HMP Magilligan gives a whole new meaning to the phrase ‘prisoners on the run’.

The jail, near Limavady, stages an official 5km (3.1 mile) parkrun on Saturday mornings.

It happens at the same time as parkrun events take place across the outside world.

The governor, Gary Milling, rejects any suggestion that the weekly event is a perk which prisoners do not deserve.

“We realise that we’ve got to do something different - rehabilitation is the key,” he said.

His aim is to reduce the chances of prisoners re-offending once released.

“This is all about making sure we create fewer victims in Northern Ireland society,” Mr Milling added.

BBC News NI was allowed to film the weekly event, and talk to some of the prisoners taking part.

Given the confined space, they have to run up and down an outdoor walkway six times.

There are none of the trees or greenery that many parkruns enjoy.

Instead, inmates run past prison huts, barbed wire and high fences.

However, they do enjoy one parkrun tradition – refreshments afterwards, including tea, coffee, biscuits and sometimes cake.

Dismissing the idea that prisoners should not be allowed a parkrun, one inmate said: “We’re here as a punishment, we’re not here to be punished.”

Another said: “I want to be healthy when I get out of jail. I don’t want to lie around and do nothing with my life.

“If people want us to come out and start re-offending again, well that’s because we haven’t done our jail time right and in here, doing this parkrun, helps us get better for getting outside.

“It’s a build up of little things that all add up to the bigger picture.”

The parkrun has been running for six years at Magilligan but only now have cameras been allowed to film it.

The governor, Gary Milling, is a runner himself, as is the deputy governor Alan Platt who has completed 250 parkruns. One of the prisoners has done 100.

A local running club, Springwell, has supported the event from the start and a number of its members took part in the 5km run on the morning we were filming.

Mr Milling said: “The big thing that you notice here … you’ve got the people that live here, the people that work here, people that have got absolutely nothing to do with here, all in here together.

“What we’re trying to do is show that inside this environment we can still hold some normality.

“Parkrun is just one of a range of interventions that we do where we’re looking to challenge people, support people, to make them look at themselves and look at their relationship with society differently.

“Over 70% or so of people that come into custody in Northern Ireland do so with alcohol and/or substance related histories.

“What the prison service is trying to do is to break those old, toxic habits of the past,” Mr Milling said.

Magilligan was the first prison parkrun on the island of Ireland and the second within the UK.

Its official title is Lower Drummans, and the event director is prison officer Colin Rice.

On the parkrun website, it does not mention it is staged within a prison but does say it takes place “on a closed facility and is therefore open to authorised people only”.

Parkruns are held around the world, including at more than 800 different locations across the UK, with more than two million participants in total.

Events are free and run by volunteers, but they also rely on local councils and land owners to enable them be staged.

The parkrun is not compulsory at Magilligan. On the day we filmed, around 30 prisoners took part in the 500-capacity jail.

The fastest time for the 5km run was 19 minutes and 25 seconds. Anything under 20 minutes is seen as quick for a parkrun.

It is billed as 'timed run' rather than a 'race', but once the weekly event begins there is keen competition for places.

Inside a jail or outside, there is always a sprint to be first.

Hey everyone,
I’m currently in an Air Force trade (CE) but injured myself during BMOQ-Army, so I’m considering a trade change. I’ve narrowed it down to AirLogO and CELE as CMOT options.

AirLogO looks appealing, especially since it’s a purple trade, and I’ve heard Finance Air LogO can be pretty relaxed (boring desk job / few or none subordinates). I’m curious if being in a purple trade means there’s a chance of getting posted to army units, which would bring me closer to home. CELE also seems like a solid option, but from what I’ve seen on EMAA, most positions are in Ottawa, which isn’t ideal for me at this time. 

I like tech and wouldn’t mind working in IT management or finance, so it’s tough to decide between the two. I’m also currently working towards a master’s related to an MBA or MBA IT management, which is something I’d like to align with my career path.

Ultimately, I’m looking for a trade that’s low-stress and good for coasting for the long term. I’d really appreciate any insights into the day-to-day life in either of these trades and how career progression typically works (I’ve heard that in the Air Force, promotions like Major are mostly time-in, especially in CE).

Which of these trades is easier on the body and mind? I’ve heard that AirLogO is mainly “coffee courses” until you’re OFP, but I’m not sure how accurate that is. I don’t know much about CELE’s workload either.

I’m hoping to stay in the CAF for a long time, so any advice or experiences you can share would be super helpful!

I always buy the same freshly roasted beans and use them about a week after they have been roasted. The settings on my Sage are usually the same: 16 seconds of grinding, grind size 3 or 4, and a yield of 30 to 34 seconds. After grinding, I use a WDT tool and tamp the coffee into the filter.

Since last week, I haven’t been able to make good coffee anymore. I just opened a new bag of freshly roasted coffee beans that I let rest for 1.5 week. The machine either doesn’t flow well or the coffee tastes too sour. In my last test, I ground for 16 seconds (about 18 grams) and let the espresso run for almost 40 seconds. The coffee only started coming out after 15 seconds. This resulted in a ratio of almost 1:1, which I had never experienced before. It feels like my machine is either not grinding well or the pressure is insufficient. Or could it be that there’s a big difference in the coffee beans, perhaps due to a different harvest?

I’m going to test again soon and will try increasing the grind size to 5 or 6, making it coarser. Maybe that will help. Normally, I manage to make good espressos consistently. Could I be forgetting something? Thanks for your help!",2,1728289764.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

(Edit: 27F, 174 lbs, 5.51 ft)

I've been trying to lose weight, desperately for the last 6 months but I've made absolutely no progress... I was weighing my best in 2022 when I was living on my own and single. I had made a conscious decision in June of 2022 to lose weight out of spite (long story) and by November I was down 8 kilograms (around 18 pounds).

I started dating someone end of January 2023, and gained 10 KGs (22 pounds) since.

I took myself off of my birth control (he is in charge of that now) and quit vaping at the same time. I know the weight gain was a combination of quitting vaping and of eating like my partner... I didn't eat horrifically but whenever we went out for dinner it'd always be starters, main and dessert instead of just a normal meal and it escalated from there.

He's also a snack fiend so there is always copious amounts of sugary, fatty substances around us and I spend 70% of my time around him.

I hate to say I'm hugely weak-willed especially since I stopped smoking... I cannot say no to food and it's ruining me a lot because mentally and physically I feel horrific at the moment, and looking at myself in the mirror makes me feel sick.

I have identified my biggest issues:

1. I cannot stop sugar. I am spineless when it comes to sugar and I cannot say no.
2. My portion sizes are exponential and I battle with insane hunger now if I don't eat large portions.

I have been trying a calorie deficit of 1200 calories per day, but my concern with this deficit is how maintainable it is. I know that ""starving"" yourself can cause metabolic issues in the long run which means once you get back to eating normally you put the weight straight back on even if you sniff a salad.

I have started walking daily, and am attempting to work that up to a run so I can run daily. My average calorie burn is sitting at roughly 300 per day.

I drink 2 litres of water a day, and maybe 1 to 2 cups of coffee (with one teaspoon of sugar).

I take Magnesium, a Multivitamin, Ashwagandha daily.

Please can someone advise on what I can do to make the calorie deficit more bearable and maintainable. I really want to kill the hunger pangs because I know that eating the way I do isn't unhealthy (lean protein and veg and fruit) but the quantity is! Not only that but please tell me there's some magical means of fighting sugar cravings because I know I can live without sugar. I've done it before.

I'm at my wits end and I'm seriously considering starting smoking again just to lose weight but I KNOW that's stupid and desperate.

Please help...

After reading the book about Atomic Habits (forget the proper title), I've been focusing on just making art a habit. Nothing more than that. No pressure. No overloading myself on tutorials. No ""minimum"" of 30 minutes a day. Just 2 minutes a day, and then I check it off on my habit tracker. 

This journey feels so different. 

This morning, I actually wanted to pick up my pen instead of watching memes with coffee. I'm working on the Loomis method right now. I attempt it from memory with a few faces.

They turn out to be hilariously squashed little creatures. A lunatic's vision. An alien drawing a human based on description alone. Homunculi, accidentally stepped on by their creator and then hastily swept under the rug, where guests have unwittingly trampled them a little more. 

I compare them to their reference and I laugh, and I smile at my attempts. I don't feel a sense of failure. I actually feel pride, because I know I'm in the process of figuring this out. I know each mistake is me getting closer to success. I know these foolish, stumpy little heads are still better than the flat, 2D road-kill faces I've been drawing previously. 

So don't take it so seriously. Treat the frustration with some fun, treat the bad results as funny. You've got nothing to prove to anyone. It's not a crime to make bad drawings. :)",2,1728289031.0,learntodraw,1,1.0,False

The soft glow of streetlights flickered overhead as I walked through the quiet city streets, the scent of rain still hanging in the air. My hands slipped into my pockets, and my thoughts drifted back to a time when I’d first come across Isla’s name—long before I’d ever seen her face, long before she became the writer she is today.

My mother had been overworked for as long as I could remember. Being a teacher wasn’t an easy job, and it had only gotten harder after my father passed. She took on more hours, more students, anything to keep herself busy. But it wore her down. Every night, she’d sit at the kitchen table, piles of papers and essays spread out in front of her, red pen in hand, a cup of cold coffee beside her.

I’d watch her work, hour after hour, marking paper after paper. She rarely complained, but I could see the exhaustion in her eyes, the way her shoulders sagged after a long day. So one evening, when I was about fourteen, I sat down beside her and offered to help. At first, she resisted, said it wasn’t my job, but eventually, she gave in. She handed me a stack of papers and told me to mark the easy ones—grammar, spelling, things I could handle.

That’s when I saw Isla’s name for the first time.

She was one of my mother’s favorite students, always mentioned in passing as “the girl with the stories.” My mother would talk about her every now and then, saying how Isla had a gift, how her writing was different from the others. I hadn’t paid much attention to it back then—it was just another student name to me. But as I sat there, grading those papers, I came across one of Isla’s essays.

It wasn’t like the others. Most students wrote their assignments because they had to, but Isla’s words carried something else—something deeper. Even at that age, I could see it. Her stories weren’t just assignments to her; they were an escape, a way of processing the world around her. And for some reason, that struck me.

I marked the paper, noting how carefully she chose her words, how she crafted her sentences with intention. It was the first time I felt like I was glimpsing something bigger, something beyond the simple tasks I was helping with. I didn’t tell my mother at the time, but I kept an eye out for Isla’s papers after that, reading them with more interest, wondering what else she’d write.

That became a regular thing for me—helping my mother grade papers when she was too tired to continue. I’d sit at the table, marking spelling and grammar mistakes, but every time I saw Isla’s name, I’d linger a little longer, reading her work with a growing curiosity. She had something. Even then, I knew it. And apparently, so did my mother.

As the years went on, my mother grew more and more worn down. The stress of teaching, the long hours, it all took its toll. But she never stopped talking about her students, especially Isla. “That girl’s going to be something someday,” she’d say, her voice filled with the kind of pride only a teacher could have. “She just needs someone to believe in her.”

But my mother never got the chance to see Isla grow into the writer she became. She passed away before Isla’s first book was published. By then, I had long since moved on from those late nights helping her grade papers. But when I saw Shattered Shadows on the shelf at a bookstore one day, the name jumped out at me.

Isla Harper.

At first, I couldn’t believe it. The same Isla who’d written those stories I’d read all those years ago? The same girl my mother had been so proud of? I picked up the book and started reading, and as I turned the pages, I felt that same spark I’d seen in her essays back then. Only now, it was bigger, more refined. She’d grown, just like my mother had always said she would.

But something was still missing.

As I stood in the bookstore that day, reading through her debut novel, I realized that Isla was still holding back. She was talented—no doubt about that—but her stories were too neat, too polished. They didn’t reflect the messy reality of the world, the way life truly fell apart. She was writing from a distance, afraid to get too close to the truth. And that’s when I knew I had to help.

I couldn’t tell you exactly why I felt responsible for her growth. Maybe it was because my mother had believed in her so much. Maybe it was because I had seen her potential early on, back when I was just a kid helping grade papers at the kitchen table. Or maybe it was because I had watched her from the sidelines for so long, reading her work, feeling like I knew her even though we’d never spoken.

Whatever the reason, I started following her career. Quietly, from a distance. I read every book, every article she published, always looking for the moment when she’d finally let go of that control, when she’d fully embrace the chaos she so carefully avoided. But it never happened. Not on her own, anyway.

That’s why I started leaving notes. Suggestions, comments, small nudges in the right direction. At first, it was just an anonymous message on her blog, then a note slipped into her bag at one of her book signings. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to push her to rethink her scenes, to take a step closer to the rawness she was avoiding.

She didn’t know it was me, of course. How could she? To her, I was just another reader. But I wasn’t. I was someone who had been there from the beginning, someone who had seen her talent from the very start, someone who had watched her grow and wanted to see her reach her full potential. I couldn’t let her fall short—not after everything my mother had done for her.

As I left the bookstore that night, the copy of Blood of Betrayal tucked under my arm, I thought about what my mother would say if she were here now. Would she be proud of Isla? Of me? Would she see the same potential in her student that I did? I liked to think so. I liked to think that, in some small way, I was finishing what my mother had started.

Tomorrow, I’d leave Isla another note. Something more direct this time. I needed her to understand that she was on the cusp of something great, but she wasn’t there yet. She needed to dig deeper, to let go of the neat endings, the clean resolutions. Life wasn’t like that, and neither were the stories that stuck with people long after the last page was turned.

I’d keep helping her, just like I had helped my mother all those years ago, grading papers late into the night. Only now, the stakes were higher. Now, it wasn’t about grammar or spelling—it was about making sure Isla became the writer she was meant to be.
