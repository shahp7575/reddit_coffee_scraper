1i0n9yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1i0n9yr/210_103_ldl_in_2_months_or_so_no_statins/,210 -> 103 LDL in 2 months or so - No Statins,"Hey all, I just wanted to post this here. The amount of posts I read saying it was definitely familial with an LDL this high, nothing I could do, immediately take statins. Just want to say there is hope.  I had my genetics tested and I don't have familial high cholesterol even though my LDL was 210. I learned my high cholesterol results a few months ago, but didn't start dieting until Nov 1st because I didn't have a doctors appointment to discuss the results so I didn't know the seriousness of it. Brought my LDL down from 210 to 103 just on diet / exercise. I know it'll be even lower in a couple more months probably and I'll re-test. Prior to the diet, I was eating almost 0 fiber and mostly all meat. Mix that in with things like ice creams, whole pizzas, 2-3 lattes a day with espresso (which I learned also raises LDL), etc. I just ate like crap. I was a little overweight, but I also tried to lose weight because I heard that would lower your LDL / Triglycerides too so I factored that into my diet. I lost 15lbs in 2 months. The impact to my health has been more than my cholesterol, I can feel it. My resting heart rate on my apple watch went from 63 to the 53 in the span of 2 months. I'm posting this here because there is so much negativity, that it's impossible. I want to let people know that it's not hopeless. Try to diet first before you go on a statin, you might be pleasantly surprised.  I'm sure for many you, diet isn't enough, but for some of you, it could do the trick. 

Diet was only around 1500 calories a day because I was trying to lose weight at the same time:

I pretty much ate the same thing for 2 months. Before we get into that this is not sustainable, I have a lot of self-control.  

  
The main things pre-diet were that I was slamming 2 or 3 double espressos / lattes with whole milk a day. I switched this to filtered brewed coffee and switched the whole milk to almond milk. I was eating mostly protein. Steaks, chicken, creamy pastas. A ton of these blue bunny ice creams. I could eat a small whole pizza for dinner but justify it was healthy because it had cauliflower crust, etc.

New diet:

Breakfast - Overnight oats (1 cup Sprouted rolled oats with 1 tablespoon of flax seeds, 1 tablespoons of chia seeds, and 1 tablespoon of non-fat greek yogurt, a small handful of blueberries if I craved some flavor )

Lunch - 2 pieces of avocado toast (1 avocado) and whole grains bread either 21 or 24 whatever I could find at the store. 

Dinner - 1 Cup of egg whites + 3 pieces of toast (whole grains bread) + 2 tablespoons of ketchup (my vice)

Randomly throughout the day I'd drink brewed coffee with almond milk

Supplements:  
Thorne Super EPA x 3  
Thorne Basic B Complex x 2 (I did get flushing from this, not enjoyable, I didn't know what it was at first.) I started separating the doses throughout the day and if I remembered with meals.

Exercise:  
Started running / walking 30 minutes or so, every other day on average.

I'm going to start re-adding some more food soonish and I'll re-test in a couple months and update you all. Hope that's useful for someone. You end up around 36-40g of fiber, some protein. I'm basically a pescatarian now.

Ply here from Rogue Wave Coffee. This month code is still the same - RogueWavefor2025 - or use [this link](https://roguewavecoffee.ca/discount/RogueWavefor2025) for 10% off coffee, MX COOL, merch, and until next update, it will also work on ICOSA Avensi Wave items (Cyclone carafe, Aeresso glass, and Alto glass). 

NEW COFFEES:

- Ethiopia Guji Masina Jasper CM natural lot 0824 - vibrant and fruity with lots of fruit notes in all spectrum. Quite complex. 

- Colombia La Esperanza geisha natural - this one is just a tad funky for a classic natural but still really nice Colombia Geisha. 

- Colombia El Placer - Pink Bourbon IPA Honey - taste quite hoppy, personally a bit too much like beer bitter for me (I don't enjoy drinking beer D: ) 

NEW Gear: 
We did get some of the ICOSA BREWHOUSE AVENSI WAVE stuff in - Cyclone cafe, aeresso glass, and alto sensory glass. I have been using them for a bit and they are very nice to use if you are into coffee x glass. We also have a really nice Origami Sensory espresso and Milk Beverage cup. We now use them in the cafe for espresso and cortado.

Trying to pick the brain of those of you who have experience with Lorings!

Myself and the other roaster at our company are stumped on how to keep our ROR from flicking / stalling at the end of the roast for a couple of our coffees in particular. We have found that on our Costa Rican and Ethiopian coffees in particular, to get the development and roast time that we are looking for, it often goes in to a territory where we our hands are tied, as we have set the gas on the Loring all the way down to 20%, and we are forced to watch in horror as a giant flick takes away a lot of the perfection in the roast that we are looking for. When either of us had roasted on a more traditional roaster in the past, we would simply add airflow - something that is not an option with the Loring. We have not had this issue with any of our other coffees - our RORs are straight as an arrow.

The photo I posted shows the issue well - I’ve cut to 20% gas at 7:35, and to get the development I’m looking for, I have to watch the flick take over. The reference curve on this coffee is a previous Costa Rican coffee that we nailed!

Any ideas from the Loring-inclined folks here? ",2,1736798876.0,roasting,0,1.0,False

As we rocket into 2025, the app world is buzzing with some seriously life-enhancing options for mental wellness. Let’s dive into a few that might just give your mind the TLC it needs!**

**1. ZenMode**: Remember those days when ""work-life balance"" seemed like a mythical creature? *ZenMode* is like having a tiny Zen master in your pocket. Combining meditation, breathwork, and quick daily reflections, this app helps you find peace in the chaos. Imagine sipping your morning coffee while listening to a guided breathing exercise. Feels good already, right?

**2. MellowMind**: Are you more into music than meditation? *MellowMind* is your jam. It creates personalized soundscapes that adapt to your emotional state – think Spotify but with vibes instead of tracks. Whether you need calming tunes for a stressful week or upbeat rhythms to shake off the blues, it’s got you covered. Don’t you love the idea of having a soundtrack for self-care?

**3. The Gratitu-list**: Gratitude journals have been around forever, but let’s be honest, who actually keeps up with them? Enter *The Gratitu-list*. This app prompts you to jot down the good stuff using quick, daily reminders. Sometimes it’s the biggest win of your week, other times it’s just remembering how awesome that first sip of coffee was. And you know what? Happiness researchers legit say this improves your mood!

**4. FocusTime Pro**: Multitasking might sound like a superpower, but we all know it’s really just a thin disguise for procrastination. ***FocusTime Pro*** brings back the basics with a 2025 twist - combining the Pomodoro technique with AI-driven breaks. It’s like having an efficiency coach that knows when you need to grind and when to gently suggest a cat video. Because yes, those little distractions can be just what the brain ordered!

**5. MoodMate**: Ever find it hard to articulate how you’re feeling? *MoodMate* is about developing a dialogue with yourself. Using a combo of mood tracking and AI-powered journaling prompts, it offers insights into your daily mental patterns. It’s like having a buddy who always knows just what to ask to get you talking. Plus, it’s oddly satisfying to look back and see the progress you didn’t even realize you were making.

Do these sound magical or what? ✨ Technology, right? Sometimes it does feel like the apps might just be a better-me-in-a-bottle formula!

Keep exploring these tech gems, and remember, they’re tools to support you, not solutions for all. We all have our off days, and that’s perfectly okay. The important thing is to find what works for you and stick with it, even if it means trying out different things along the way.

The way I got into it was mostly luck (a cousins partner worked there), and I had no prior experience, nor a college degree. The company is huge, and i'm in the marketing department, kind of - and also most likely the only one without a degree. I've been 'faking' my way through the last 5 years. I have no interest in the actual role itself and find it incredibly hard to stay motivated and focused (as I write this post during work hours). The only times I get jazzed up are when I am doing something creative (editing a video for the team, etc.). It's a work from home job, which is great at times, but now that my Fiancee is in the office 5x/week it's getting pretty lonely. I don't have many meetings either so I catch myself just waiting for lunch and waiting for 5PM. Those are the main highlights of my day. And I don't want to do that anymore!

I feel like I am in this position of confusion and lack of direction. I want to leave my job because nothing about it excites me, but I don't have a degree so i'm not sure what to do. I've applied to a hundred random linkedin jobs and got nothing, obviously. I struggle to start a work project because I subconsciously don't want to forget about the goal of quitting, and if I sink my teeth into something i'll lose sight of that. I'm behind on tasks because of that. I also haven't learned anything the entire time. Like hardly anything that I could take to a new role, which is another thing that makes it tough to apply anywhere.

I've used this job as a comfort because it pays well, but i've gotten to the point where i'd rather work at a coffee shop making less than half of what I do. It would make me happier I think. I have nothing to look forward to most mornings because i'm just going to sit at my desk all day and stare at the screen, distract myself with social media, and ponder what else I could be doing.

I went to acting school, and have always wanted to work in film & tv, i'm just not sure where to start. Sorry for the sob story. I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but wanted to see if it could give me any momentum! ",1,1736798763.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

Justin Alonzo was dead. Despite the supposedly violent car crash, there was little hint of damage on his face, to the credit of the funeral home’s repairs. To be frank, Ivy thought he looked perfect. She had never seen someone so beautiful. Ivy didn’t like to cry. But today, it felt inevitable. 

At just 11 years old, she had been lucky enough to know a love deeper than she ever thought possible. If only he had had the time to love her back. Or even know that she loved him at all. 

Looking back at her mother, the young girl took a step toward the casket with her flower in hand—an ivy—so that she could always be with him. She stared at his closed eyelids, silently praying for this to be a dream. She had thought about this moment all week. He *had* to know. She couldn’t die without him knowing. So, in a hushed voice, softer than a whisper, she told him. 

“I’ll miss you, Justin,” she said in this near whisper, her hand grazing the dark wood of the casket. She then worked up the courage to continue her quiet proclamation. 

“Justin, I’ve loved you for the past five years. I wish I could have told you while you were here, and I’ll regret it for the rest of my life.” It was doubtful he would have been able to even hear her if he were alive, for her voice was so quiet.

She sighed as if she were releasing a giant weight from atop her slight shoulders. She felt a bit silly, knowing his parents were in the front row, and his sisters were in tears, huddled up to their mother.  Ivy knew she wasn’t special. It was doubtful he even knew she existed. 

She hadn’t expected an answer. But yet, Justin Alonzo spoke back. 

“That’s nice, but I loved Gabby,” he said, voice misting in an echo over the room. In a panic, Ivy turned back to find her mom, sure she must have imagined it. But when she turned back, everyone was frozen. Her mom was in mid-stride toward her, their classmate Amy mid-hair-flip, and her history teacher mid-lipstick-application. 

When she turned back to the casket in a frenzy, Justin’s eyes were opened—glassy—and shifted toward her with emptiness. She could still discern the warmth of his irises, despite the endless depth of his pupils and the glossiness that ran his eyes over. It wasn’t Justin…but wasn’t it?

Ivy pinched herself to make sure she wasn’t dreaming, hard enough to make her ears ring. 

But then she came to her senses. The universe was giving her an opportunity.

“I know,” she said, voice still in a whisper, despite the frozen room around them, “but maybe we could have been boyfriend and girlfriend if I had said something sooner.”

As soon as she said it, she felt a deep, hot pang of embarrassment flush through her.

“Can you tell my mom and dad that I love them? And Annie and Rachel? And Gabby? I’m really sorry to do this to them,” he said, his whisper hanging in the air of the vaulted chapel. 

Before she could respond, the word returned to normal. 

“Come on Ivy,” her mom said, guiding her to step away from the casket. “There’s a big line.”

For the rest of the ceremony, Ivy resisted the urge to flee the chapel because of her embarrassment. She wished it were a dream, but deep down, she knew she was utterly and completely strange. 



 

Ivy’s family was normal. Her father was a banker. Her mother was a teacher. Her brother played soccer. Her sister was involved in everything their school had to offer. Ivy—the youngest of the bunch—had a secret fascination with the dead. 

Jeanie Hanes was unsure why her middle school daughter had such a proclivity for the obituary section of the newspaper. Every morning, while Andrew Hanes read the sports section of the local paper while sipping on his coffee, Ivy would ask him for the last pages of the newspaper. Not one for conversation in the early morning, Gregory thought nothing of it, handing his youngest daughter the papers.  

After a few mornings of this, Ivy asked, “Hey Pa’, don’t you think we should go to Mr. Hudson’s funeral? He was Addy’s cello teacher.”  

Mid sip, her father set his coffee cup down, raising his eyes to his youngest across the table. Ivy sipped on her orange juice, not even realizing the confusion that was arising from her question.

“Ask your mother,” was all he said, dark eyebrows furrowed quizzically. ",1,1736798573.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

As I've been told by my friend, he has given Beji an amount of money to invest in some commercial business, in condition that my friend will get half of the profits in addition to his initial investment. My friend is the one who came up with the idea of this business, and since he has another business he is running he needed someone he trusts to run the new business, and he thought about this friend he has, the one I called Beji.

Beji turned out to get involved in the same practice with a third individual, let's call him Sbou3i, borrowing money from him as well to expand the business and giving him the same promise he has given my friend of sharing profits. I heard this directly from Sbou3i himself when once he sat with my friend and I for a coffee. My friend was shocked that his business idea was sold to a new person as well.

Beji while running the business got himself in some financial issues, getting scammed by some client at some point so he lost a lot of money and wasn't able to pay his dues to my friend (I don't know about whether he was paying Sbou3i or not), and now he is avoiding my friend Slimen.

Two days ago I met Slimen, and he informed me that he discovered that Beji has somehow solved the business's financial problems he was facing, so now per Slimen account the business is running great and making profits, but Beji is still avoiding him and not paying him anything back. So Slimen came up with an idea where he wanted me to deceive his friend Beji and test whether he is honest and loyal to him or not.

Sometimes I meet Beji in a coffee shop I like, and we sit together for a coffee, and since my friend Slimen knows about this he suggested that I tell a fake story to Beji to see what he will do as a reaction. The story I would tell is that I should mention that I've noticed my friend Slimen behaving weirdly lately, and that he approached me very late at one night asking me to loan him some amount of money, and that this is the first time it ever happened that he asked me for money although we are close friends for two decades so this should tell he is in financial trouble, also I should mention that my friend Slimen is not meeting me as often as before and is avoiding me now, and also I should ask Beji whether he is seeing Slimen or not or whether he knows anything about his financial situation.

My friend's idea is that this story will show whether Beji is honest and loyal to their friendship or not, since -as my friend Slimen assumed- if Beji really cares about their friendship he would reach out to Slimen because he is allegedly in a bad financial situation -as the story I would have told should imply- and as a reaction Beji should offer to pay Slimen back the initial investment he gave him at least to help with his financial troubles.

Slimen mentioned that he wants to try this strategy first as he doesn't want to move forward with serious actions like taking making a huge fuss with Beji or sue him or something alike.

Now, first I'm not into lying, I won't feel comfortable telling someone a fake story and I don't like to deceive people. And second I heard this story of the investment and the non payments from my friend Slimen only. So I have no clue about Beji's version of the story. And even if I know the Beji version I don't want to get involved in other people's disputes. I believe it's not my business, even if I see that one party is more just than the other. Or I would help if both parties ask for it, not just one of them asking me to side with him to deceive the other!

I know my friend Slimen is a very sensitive person, and I'm sure if I tell him I can't do what he asked me he would get upset and would think that I'm betraying our very long friendship and don't care about solving his problem, so when he mentioned that idea of his to deceive his friend, I only responded by ""ataw nchouf - I will look into it"". But now I'm a bit confused about what to do next, as he knows I'm frequently visiting the coffee shop I mentioned and I should have met Beji friend one day or another, so my friend surely will ask me whether I've told Beji the story or not.

What should I do?

P.S Please I'm looking for creative ideas only. Things like ""your friend is an asshole and you should stop being his friend"" won't work, I don't want to end a +20 years friendship because of this now. I've never found myself in such situation with this friend. Usually we don't put ourselves in such complicated matters at all. We are close friends but our personal, family, relational and financial problems are matters no one of us ever interferes with the other's. This is the first time ever he brings such matter.",0,1736798262.0,Tunisia,1,0.25,False

Right now I workout as a last thing for my day because of my schedule(M/W/F) and sometimes I just don't have energy to finish those last few sets in the routine. I start around 8pm, try to finish by \~9pm, go take a shower, prep few quick things for the next day and pretty much go to bed around 10pm. My biggest problem right now is that lack of energy and the solution I would like to try is a pre-workout, I read here about having a banana and/or coffee but I don't like eating that late and coffee just doesn't do it for me.

Aqua Hour got left out, sorry :( but here's the 6 I got and my thoughts.

You're Cheeky (Pink Peppercorn, Warm Almond Flower, Vanilla Bean): Okay, unless I'm just completely broken, this is basically Oh, Cherry. Not even kidding, it is a 1:1 scent replica of Oh, Cherry. Part of me is curious if perhaps they goofed and accidentally packaged Oh, Cherry into this bottle, or maybe that's how the scent smells. It's odd.

Seeing Rouge (Blackcurrant Buds, Sweet Saffron, Amber Moss): Hooray, a spicy scent, but unfortunately I'm just not living for it. It's pretty subtle to my nose, as in, I've tried spraying it on 4 different places and I'm still not picking up on a heavy scent.

Loyal to You (Sweet Lemon Blossom, Orange Flower, Vanilla Marshmallow): Do you wanna smell like Lemon Cake? It's definitely on the fresh side, but the vanilla marshmallow note also makes it feel like you're wearing a dessert. It's almost like a more expensive version of Iced Lemon Pound Cake.

Guilty as Fig (Fig Nectar, Lush Jasmine, Creamy Musk): This one is my favorite. It smells exactly like fresh figs, and the jasmine and musk notes make you feel like you're picking figs from a tree.

Madame Mystique (Bright Red Berries, Rose Petals, Sultry Woods): This one smells good but it definitely isn't as much of a doorbuster floral as Petal Parade and Floral Fantasy were. It's a nice fruity floral though, especially if you like berries.

Midnight Addiction (Ripe Plum, Rich Almond Flower, Addictive Coffee Bean): I can't give a confident review on this one because it smells like YSL Black Opium, which smells like Floral Fantasy to me. I don't know why, no matter how much I try, I just smell Floral Fantasy. But this is the only scent in the line that I've actually smelled the inspo, so if you're a fan of Black Opium this is a 1:1 copy.

Lastly, I didn't buy it but 4Ever Sweet smells just like Sweethearts. Can't wait to get it.

Every week for the past three years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 41% of companies worldwide plan to reduce workforces by 2030 due to AI, according to a World Economic Forum survey. Out of hundreds of large companies surveyed around the world, 77% also said they were planning to reskill and upskill their existing workers between 2025-2030 to better work alongside AI.
___
**Amazon** announced a new program called **Amazon Ad Retail Service** that lets other retailers use its advertising technology to showcase ads on their own websites. The service enables retailers to manage product ads on their search, browse, and product pages to help customers with product discovery and purchase decisions. It's currently available to multi-brand retailers in the US with an e-commerce site or app. Ads can incorporate availability, price, shopper search query, and the category or product being viewed, and retailres determine ad formats as well as where the ads appear on their websites and how often. The service is currently in beta with iHerb, Oriental Trading Company, and Weee!, with additional brands like Tilly’s launching soon.
___
**Meta** is ending fact-checking on its platforms, and the world is freaking out as if fact-checking actually worked. Mark Zuckerberg even admits that it was a flawed system. He said: “I’m counting on these changes actually making our platforms better. I think Community Notes will be more effective than fact-checkers, reducing the number of people whose accounts get mistakenly banned is good, people want to be able to discuss civic topics and make arguments that are in the mainstream of political discourse, etc."" The “Community Notes” system he mentioned will roll out in the US over the coming months, with plans to refine it throughout the year. Meta has no immediate plans to end or modify its fact-checking program in the European Union, where stricter regulations like the Digital Services Act require platforms to combat illegal content and misinformation.
___
**Automattic** announced that it would be decreasing its contributions to **WordPress**, the open-source project, to instead focus on for-profit projects within Automattic, such as WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. The company wrote: “We’ve observed an imbalance in how contributions to WordPress are distributed across the ecosystem, and it’s time to address this. Additionally, we’re having to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves against the legal attacks started by WP Engine and funded by Silver Lake, a large private equity firm. As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical updates. Members of the ‘community' have said that working on these sorts of things should count as a contribution to WordPress.” Automattic currently donates 1430 hours per week, which means it intends to invest 97 percent less development time in the future.
___
**eBay** partnered up with **Meta** to enable eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace in the US, Germany, and France. Yay, just what everyone always wanted… eBay listings polluting Facebook Marketplace! The move comes in response to the European Union's Nov 2024 decision to fine Meta €797.72M for breaching EU antitrust rules by tying its Facebook Marketplace to its social network and imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads services. When an item from eBay sells through Facebook Marketplace, buyers will be redirected to eBay to finalize their purchase. All sales will be protected by eBay's Money Back Guarantee and other applicable eBay policies. From what I understood in eBay's announcement, eBay sellers won't have the option to opt-in or -out of listing their products on Facebook Marketplace. The decision is totally up to eBay and sellers agree to it when they choose to list items on eBay.
___
**Best Buy** is planning to launch a new third-party marketplace in the US in mid-2025, allowing brands to directly sell their products to Best Buy's customers (similar to how Amazon, Walmart, and other marketplaces allow third-party sellers). If you've been in the industry long enough and this news sounds familiar, it's because Best Buy previously attempted to run a third-party marketplace in the US from 2011 to 2016. The company eventually shut it down because it only brought in 1% of its revenue and created confusion among buyers who thought they could return products sold by third-party sellers to Best Buy stores. (Customers should have been allowed to return items to Best Buy stores. What a great differentiator that would've been for both buyers and sellers! Such a waste of a national retail footprint…) Now Best Buy has apparently learned from its mistakes and is ready to re-enter the marketplace business in the US, this time in partnership with Mirakl, a software company that also powers third-party marketplaces for companies like Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Kroger.
___
**The EU General Court** ruled on Wednesday that the European Commission must pay damages to a German citizen for failing to comply with its own data protection regulations. The court determined that the Commission transferred the citizen's personal data to the US without proper safeguards and ordered it to pay him €400 in damages. Back in 2022, a man used the “Sign in with Facebook” option on the EU login site to register for the “Conference on the Future of Europe.” The login transferred his IP address to Meta in the US, violating EU data protection rules which state that users' personal info can only be transferred outside the EU when those jurisdictions have been found to have equivalent safeguards to those in Europe. At the time, the EU had not assigned that status to the US. The court concluded that the action constituted a “sufficiently serious breach” of the rules, and warranted a financial penalty (albeit a small one). I've got to hand it to the EU on this one. Way to set an example that no-one's above the law!
___
On Friday, the **US Supreme Court** heard oral arguments on whether or not to temporarily block the law requiring **TikTok** to divest to a US company or face a nationwide ban, marking a final chance for the company to make its case. TikTok argued that if Congress was truly concerned about data security, they'd also go after Shein and Temu, which collect plenty of data too, and that it's not possible to disentangle TikTok US from ByteDance quickly. The DOJ argued that TikTok could be used to build profiles on Americans and be used for ""harassment, recruitment, and espionage"", and that Elon Musk bought Twitter in six months, so TikTok can't say they haven't had enough time to sell. Now we wait for a Supreme Court decision...
___
In the meantime though… **TikTok** is promoting its sister app, **Lemon8**, as an alternative to TikTok via sponsored posts on TikTok featuring the app and highlighting automatic data transfer and follower integration between the two platforms. TikTok users are also flocking to **Xiaohongshu**, known as “Rednote” in English — which is a Chinese app that's a cross between Instagram and Pinterest. The app surged to the number-one spot for free apps in the US App Store.
___
Amidst all the drama surrounding a potential ban in the US, **TikTok** is still moving full steam ahead. The company released its annual **What's Next 2025** report sharing insights about top trends and strategies that we're going to see on its platform this year. Funny enough it didn't mention the US ban anywhere in the report. It did talk about brands focusing on more creators as opposed to the loudest voice representing their brand, conversational content such as street interviews and behind-the-scenes moments building trust with consumers, AI giving brands a creative edge by enabling faster ideation and production, and the comment section being the new focus group for brands. 
___
**Amazon** is shutting down its **Try Before You Buy** program at the end January, a service that allowed customers to choose up to six items to try on and send back whatever they didn't want within a week for free, only being charged for the items they decided to keep. Amazon says that new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts help make sure customers are finding the right fit without the need for the service.
___
**TikTok** revealed that it's in the process of launching its first e-commerce product exclusively for travel brands called Travel Ads, aimed at helping brands find people on its platform who are in the market to book a trip. The product is currently being tested with a select number of brands, with plans to roll it out for general availability in the near future. Travel content continues to grow on TikTok, with posts containing hashtags that include the word “travel” up 250% YoY, with the specific hashtag for #luxurytravel receiving 27M views in the last month alone. 
___
**Shopify** launched the Partner Solutions Center, which features pre-built partner solutions that are designed to meet the complex commerce needs of Enterprise merchants. Initial offerings include an analytics package from Accenture, a Salesforce Service Cloud Accelerator from Astound Digital, a Next Generation Retail Commerce Delivery Model from Deloitte Digital, and more. Shopify says that by collaborating with global system integrators, agencies, and independent software vendors, the Partner Solutions Center will empower merchants to launch new commerce capabilities faster than ever. It kind of sounds like an Enterprise app marketplace (using the word “app” very liberally in this context) that'll have the same impact on Enterprise brands as the Shopify App Marketplace had on SMBs.
___
**Shopify** acquired the domains **shop-ca** and **shop-us** from Emerge Commerce, a Toronto-based e-commerce aggregator, for $375k USD ($536,000 CAD). Emerge originally purchased the domains to run a platform that provided coupons alongside retail content and shopping guides, but the websites had not generated revenue in quite some time, so they found it to be a better business decision to sell them to Shopify instead. The domains now redirect users to Shopify's pseudo-online marketplace, Shop App.
___
**Amazon** delayed its full return-to-office plan at more than 40 office locations due to lack of space, according to an internal list leaked to Business Insider. Amazon's original policy pivot required employees to work from the office five days a week again beginning January 2nd, but apparently the offices aren't ready. I previously reported on this news last month, but it wasn't yet known that the office space shortage affected 40 different locations. Amazon claims that the Business Insider article is incorrect and misleading, and that only a “relatively small number” of offices aren't ready (like 40 offices?).
___
**Amazon** is halting some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, according to an internal memo, which said that the company is in the process of “winding down outdated programs and materials” as part of a broader review of hundreds of initiatives. In 2020, Amazon set a goal of doubling the number of Black employees in VP and Director roles, later announcing the same goal in 2021 and pledging to hire 30% more Black employees for product manager, engineer, and other corporate roles. 
___
**Meta** made similar announcements last week, informing employees that it plans to end a number of internal programs designed to increase the company's hiring of diverse candidates. The company will suspend its current approach to considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups for open rules, as well as its equity and inclusion training programs. Meta's Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will move into a new role focused on accessibility and engagement. To be fair, Meta hasn't had the best luck with its diversity programs. Remember their former global diversity executive, Barbara Furlow-Smiles, who embezzled over $4M from the company by paying her friends and family for fake services that were never rendered? Plus, it sounds like diversity won't be much of an issue when AI takes over everyone's position at the company… (scroll down a few stories). 
___
**Squared shipping packages** are making a comeback because they're easier to transport, especially for automated robots, which generally do better with items that are perfectly dimensionalized. Many brands are also transitioning to rigid square or rectangle packaging for the products themselves, not just their shipping packages, including items like pet food and laundry detergent, which traditionally used flexible packaging.
___
**Uniqlo**, a Japanese casual wear retailer known for its minimalist, high quality, functional designs, agreed to stop using gig economy apps, like Temper and YoungOnes, to hire temporary workers, over concern that workers hired through the apps were left with little or no protections that are available to other workers hired through more traditional channels. The retailer told The Guardian that it would only hire for temporary and permanent positions either directly or through other channels that ensure staff are eligible for employment benefits.
___
**China's State Administration for Market Regulation** announced its intentions to tighten oversight of online platforms and livestream e-commerce as part of a larger initiative aimed at fostering fair competition and providing better protection for smaller businesses. At a press briefing, the regulatory body revealed that the government plans to introduce more stringent measures to enhance the transparency of platform regulations, reduce the operational costs for merchants, and address the growing concerns within the e-commerce ecosystem.
___
**Amazon** is paying $40M to license a new documentary on incoming first lady Melania Trump, who will also serve as executive producer on the film. The price tag includes the film itself, a smaller-scale theatrical run before being featured on Prime Video, and a supplementary docuseries. The documentary will be directed and produced by Brett Ratner, who was forced out of Hollywood at the peak of the #MeToo movement. It is unclear how much Melania will be paid for her contributions.
___
**Mark Zuckerberg** revealed on a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience that Meta and some of the biggest companies in the tech industry will start automating the work of midlevel software engineers this year and eventually outsource all coding on its apps to AI. It may initially be an expensive endeavor, but Zuckerberg said that Meta will reach the point where all of the code in its apps and the AI it generates will also be done by AI. So one question… how will midlevel software engineers become senior software engineers without jobs?
___
**Your brand name on Amazon** can now match your product name, veering from a long-time rule that didn't allow duplicate words in titles, even when the word was part of the brand name. This will allow, for example, The Bean Coffee Company selling a 16 oz Ground Coffee Bag to use the title, “16oz Ground Coffee Bags from The Bean Coffee Company.”
___
**TikTok** is hosting its second annual Global Live Fest on Jan 16th in London, bringing together creators from around the world and featuring musical performances from artists who have come up on TikTok Live. Zara Larsson is set to headline the event, which will be hosted by Jason Derulo and livestreamed to users.
___
**X** launched a standalone iOS app for its Grok chatbot in beta across the US, Australia, and India. The app offers features such as text rewriting, paragraph summarization, Q&A capabilities, and image generation based on text prompts. The company is also preparing a dedicated site, Grok-com, to make the chatbot accessible on the web. Previously Grok was only available to X users until now, and only to X Premium users until this past November.
___
**Kohl's** is closing its Inland Empire e-commerce fulfillment center as well as 27 retail stores across the country by April, with plans to also close its San Bernardino fulfillment center when the facility's lease expires in May. The company claims that it has increased efficiencies with new technology in recent years, allowing it to maintain its ability to fulfill orders with less facilities. (Uh huh…) The company's CEO Tom Kingsbury will step down from the position on Jan 15th, to be replaced by Ashley Buchanan, former CEO of Michaels Companies. 
___
**Meta** has stopped selling its remaining inventory of Quest Pro devices, following its announced plans to discontinue selling the high-end headset two months ago at either the end of the year or when it ran out of stock. The Quest Pro sold for between $1,000 and $1,500 over the short course of its life, and now its product page encourages users to consider the Meta Quest 3 instead, which sells for $500. 
___
**Flipkart** appointed **Kabeer Biswas**, the co-founder of Dunzo, an Indian hyperlocal delivery platform, to lead its quick-commerce service, Minutes. The move follows previous discussions about acquiring Dunzo, which were ultimately hindered by the delivery platform's ownership structure and Reliance Retail's significant investment.
___
**Zalando**, a European e-commerce company specializing in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products, expanded its partnership with **Klarna** by introducing its Pay in 3 installment payment option to five new European markets including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Poland, and The Netherlands. The expansion follows Klarna's launch in France, Italy, and Spain in 2024.

**PhishWP**, a WordPress plugin designed by Russian cybercriminals, has been found to turn WordPress websites into phishing pages by creating fake online payment processes that impersonate trusted checkout services like Stripe and stealing customer payment data. Instead of processing payments, the plugin sends credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVVs, billing addresses, and other billing info to a Telegram account controlled by the criminals. The plugin is being installed on both legitimate, but compromised WordPress websites, as well as fraudulent sites.
___
**TikTok's Los Angeles-based employees** are being told to either continue their work from home or use their personal or sick days if that's not possible, amid the wildfires that have burned over 45 square miles and put nearly 180k people under evacuation orders. The company's Culver City office itself is not under mandatory evacuation orders at this time, however, the office remains closed due to power outages caused by high winds, and the Palisades Fire is close enough that smoke can be seen out of the office windows.
___
**Poshmark** teamed up with **Loop Returns** for a new program that will allow shoppers to sell unwanted items that they can't return to the original merchant on Poshmark's platform. When US merchants that use Loop Returns enable this feature for their customers, shoppers initiating a return will see a “Resell on Poshmark” button next to items that aren't eligible for a traditional return — for example if they are final sale items or outside of the merchant's return window. One click will produce a complete, pre-filled listing on Poshmark with the item details. Brilliant partnership!
___
**Bukalapak**, an Indonesian e-commerce marketplace, said that it would stop selling physical items on its marketplace soon, amid tough competition from TikTok's Tokopedia and Sea's Shopee in the country. Moving forward, the company will only sell virtual products ranging from mobile phone credits to streaming vouchers. Customers have until Feb 9th to make last orders for certain items.
___
**Amazon** began testing its quick commerce offering, **Tez**, in India with employees in some Bengaluru neighborhoods. The company is also starting to onboard dark stores across the busiest areas of the city, according to ET sources. Walmart-owned Flipkart's quick commerce service, Minutes, is set to hit around 150 dark stores this quarter and is expanding aggressively, so Amazon has some catching up to do.
___
**Albertson's** launched a new e-commerce campaign that will run through Feb 26th featuring a series of 15-second and 6-second videos spotlighting the benefits of online shopping with the grocer. The videos, which will run on YouTube and Instagram, highlight Albertson's guaranteed product freshness, online deals and rewards, speedy delivery, and streamlined shopping experience through its BOPIS option.
___
**Meta** was discovered to be hosting AI chatbots imitating Hitler, Jesus, Taylor Swift, and other personalities that violated its policies, according to a NBC News investigation. Many of the characters used slight misspellings and images loosely resembling the people they were meant to represent, such as “Taylor Swif” which featured a brunette woman playing a guitar. Meta took down the individual accounts that were highlighted by the investigation, but other AI characters resembling the same people are still active.
___
Plus 12 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Whatnot** raising $265M at a $5B valuation, and **Pipe17** raising $15.5M for its Series A round.

Every week for the past 3+ years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...
___
**STAT OF THE WEEK:** 41% of companies worldwide plan to reduce workforces by 2030 due to AI, according to a World Economic Forum survey. Out of hundreds of large companies surveyed around the world, 77% also said they were planning to reskill and upskill their existing workers between 2025-2030 to better work alongside AI.
___
**Amazon** announced a new program called **Amazon Ad Retail Service** that lets other retailers use its advertising technology to showcase ads on their own websites. The service enables retailers to manage product ads on their search, browse, and product pages to help customers with product discovery and purchase decisions. It's currently available to multi-brand retailers in the US with an e-commerce site or app. Ads can incorporate availability, price, shopper search query, and the category or product being viewed, and retailres determine ad formats as well as where the ads appear on their websites and how often. The service is currently in beta with iHerb, Oriental Trading Company, and Weee!, with additional brands like Tilly’s launching soon.
___
**Meta** is ending fact-checking on its platforms, and the world is freaking out as if fact-checking actually worked. Mark Zuckerberg even admits that it was a flawed system. He said: “I’m counting on these changes actually making our platforms better. I think Community Notes will be more effective than fact-checkers, reducing the number of people whose accounts get mistakenly banned is good, people want to be able to discuss civic topics and make arguments that are in the mainstream of political discourse, etc."" The “Community Notes” system he mentioned will roll out in the US over the coming months, with plans to refine it throughout the year. Meta has no immediate plans to end or modify its fact-checking program in the European Union, where stricter regulations like the Digital Services Act require platforms to combat illegal content and misinformation.
___
**Automattic** announced that it would be decreasing its contributions to **WordPress**, the open-source project, to instead focus on for-profit projects within Automattic, such as WordPress.com, Pressable, WPVIP, Jetpack, and WooCommerce. The company wrote: “We’ve observed an imbalance in how contributions to WordPress are distributed across the ecosystem, and it’s time to address this. Additionally, we’re having to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves against the legal attacks started by WP Engine and funded by Silver Lake, a large private equity firm. As part of this reset, Automattic will match its volunteering pledge with those made by WP Engine and other players in the ecosystem, or about 45 hours a week that qualify under the Five For the Future program as benefitting the entire community and not just a single company. These hours will likely go towards security and critical updates. Members of the ‘community' have said that working on these sorts of things should count as a contribution to WordPress.” Automattic currently donates 1430 hours per week, which means it intends to invest 97 percent less development time in the future.
___
**eBay** partnered up with **Meta** to enable eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace in the US, Germany, and France. Yay, just what everyone always wanted… eBay listings polluting Facebook Marketplace! The move comes in response to the European Union's Nov 2024 decision to fine Meta €797.72M for breaching EU antitrust rules by tying its Facebook Marketplace to its social network and imposing unfair trading conditions on other online classified ads services. When an item from eBay sells through Facebook Marketplace, buyers will be redirected to eBay to finalize their purchase. All sales will be protected by eBay's Money Back Guarantee and other applicable eBay policies. From what I understood in eBay's announcement, eBay sellers won't have the option to opt-in or -out of listing their products on Facebook Marketplace. The decision is totally up to eBay and sellers agree to it when they choose to list items on eBay.
___
**Best Buy** is planning to launch a new third-party marketplace in the US in mid-2025, allowing brands to directly sell their products to Best Buy's customers (similar to how Amazon, Walmart, and other marketplaces allow third-party sellers). If you've been in the industry long enough and this news sounds familiar, it's because Best Buy previously attempted to run a third-party marketplace in the US from 2011 to 2016. The company eventually shut it down because it only brought in 1% of its revenue and created confusion among buyers who thought they could return products sold by third-party sellers to Best Buy stores. (Customers should have been allowed to return items to Best Buy stores. What a great differentiator that would've been for both buyers and sellers! Such a waste of a national retail footprint…) Now Best Buy has apparently learned from its mistakes and is ready to re-enter the marketplace business in the US, this time in partnership with Mirakl, a software company that also powers third-party marketplaces for companies like Macy’s, Nordstrom, and Kroger.
___
**The EU General Court** ruled on Wednesday that the European Commission must pay damages to a German citizen for failing to comply with its own data protection regulations. The court determined that the Commission transferred the citizen's personal data to the US without proper safeguards and ordered it to pay him €400 in damages. Back in 2022, a man used the “Sign in with Facebook” option on the EU login site to register for the “Conference on the Future of Europe.” The login transferred his IP address to Meta in the US, violating EU data protection rules which state that users' personal info can only be transferred outside the EU when those jurisdictions have been found to have equivalent safeguards to those in Europe. At the time, the EU had not assigned that status to the US. The court concluded that the action constituted a “sufficiently serious breach” of the rules, and warranted a financial penalty (albeit a small one). I've got to hand it to the EU on this one. Way to set an example that no-one's above the law!
___
On Friday, the **US Supreme Court** heard oral arguments on whether or not to temporarily block the law requiring **TikTok** to divest to a US company or face a nationwide ban, marking a final chance for the company to make its case. TikTok argued that if Congress was truly concerned about data security, they'd also go after Shein and Temu, which collect plenty of data too, and that it's not possible to disentangle TikTok US from ByteDance quickly. The DOJ argued that TikTok could be used to build profiles on Americans and be used for ""harassment, recruitment, and espionage"", and that Elon Musk bought Twitter in six months, so TikTok can't say they haven't had enough time to sell. Now we wait for a Supreme Court decision...
___
In the meantime though… **TikTok** is promoting its sister app, **Lemon8**, as an alternative to TikTok via sponsored posts on TikTok featuring the app and highlighting automatic data transfer and follower integration between the two platforms. TikTok users are also flocking to **Xiaohongshu**, known as “Rednote” in English — which is a Chinese app that's a cross between Instagram and Pinterest. The app surged to the number-one spot for free apps in the US App Store.
___
Amidst all the drama surrounding a potential ban in the US, **TikTok** is still moving full steam ahead. The company released its annual **What's Next 2025** report sharing insights about top trends and strategies that we're going to see on its platform this year. Funny enough it didn't mention the US ban anywhere in the report. It did talk about brands focusing on more creators as opposed to the loudest voice representing their brand, conversational content such as street interviews and behind-the-scenes moments building trust with consumers, AI giving brands a creative edge by enabling faster ideation and production, and the comment section being the new focus group for brands. 
___
**Amazon** is shutting down its **Try Before You Buy** program at the end January, a service that allowed customers to choose up to six items to try on and send back whatever they didn't want within a week for free, only being charged for the items they decided to keep. Amazon says that new AI-powered features like virtual try-on, personalized size recommendations, review highlights, and improved size charts help make sure customers are finding the right fit without the need for the service.
___
**TikTok** revealed that it's in the process of launching its first e-commerce product exclusively for travel brands called Travel Ads, aimed at helping brands find people on its platform who are in the market to book a trip. The product is currently being tested with a select number of brands, with plans to roll it out for general availability in the near future. Travel content continues to grow on TikTok, with posts containing hashtags that include the word “travel” up 250% YoY, with the specific hashtag for #luxurytravel receiving 27M views in the last month alone. 
___
**Shopify** launched the Partner Solutions Center, which features pre-built partner solutions that are designed to meet the complex commerce needs of Enterprise merchants. Initial offerings include an analytics package from Accenture, a Salesforce Service Cloud Accelerator from Astound Digital, a Next Generation Retail Commerce Delivery Model from Deloitte Digital, and more. Shopify says that by collaborating with global system integrators, agencies, and independent software vendors, the Partner Solutions Center will empower merchants to launch new commerce capabilities faster than ever. It kind of sounds like an Enterprise app marketplace (using the word “app” very liberally in this context) that'll have the same impact on Enterprise brands as the Shopify App Marketplace had on SMBs.
___
**Shopify** acquired the domains **shop-ca** and **shop-us** from Emerge Commerce, a Toronto-based e-commerce aggregator, for $375k USD ($536,000 CAD). Emerge originally purchased the domains to run a platform that provided coupons alongside retail content and shopping guides, but the websites had not generated revenue in quite some time, so they found it to be a better business decision to sell them to Shopify instead. The domains now redirect users to Shopify's pseudo-online marketplace, Shop App.
___
**Amazon** delayed its full return-to-office plan at more than 40 office locations due to lack of space, according to an internal list leaked to Business Insider. Amazon's original policy pivot required employees to work from the office five days a week again beginning January 2nd, but apparently the offices aren't ready. I previously reported on this news last month, but it wasn't yet known that the office space shortage affected 40 different locations. Amazon claims that the Business Insider article is incorrect and misleading, and that only a “relatively small number” of offices aren't ready (like 40 offices?).
___
**Amazon** is halting some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, according to an internal memo, which said that the company is in the process of “winding down outdated programs and materials” as part of a broader review of hundreds of initiatives. In 2020, Amazon set a goal of doubling the number of Black employees in VP and Director roles, later announcing the same goal in 2021 and pledging to hire 30% more Black employees for product manager, engineer, and other corporate roles. 
___
**Meta** made similar announcements last week, informing employees that it plans to end a number of internal programs designed to increase the company's hiring of diverse candidates. The company will suspend its current approach to considering qualified candidates from underrepresented groups for open rules, as well as its equity and inclusion training programs. Meta's Chief Diversity Officer Maxine Williams will move into a new role focused on accessibility and engagement. To be fair, Meta hasn't had the best luck with its diversity programs. Remember their former global diversity executive, Barbara Furlow-Smiles, who embezzled over $4M from the company by paying her friends and family for fake services that were never rendered? Plus, it sounds like diversity won't be much of an issue when AI takes over everyone's position at the company… (scroll down a few stories). 
___
**Squared shipping packages** are making a comeback because they're easier to transport, especially for automated robots, which generally do better with items that are perfectly dimensionalized. Many brands are also transitioning to rigid square or rectangle packaging for the products themselves, not just their shipping packages, including items like pet food and laundry detergent, which traditionally used flexible packaging.
___
**Uniqlo**, a Japanese casual wear retailer known for its minimalist, high quality, functional designs, agreed to stop using gig economy apps, like Temper and YoungOnes, to hire temporary workers, over concern that workers hired through the apps were left with little or no protections that are available to other workers hired through more traditional channels. The retailer told The Guardian that it would only hire for temporary and permanent positions either directly or through other channels that ensure staff are eligible for employment benefits.
___
**China's State Administration for Market Regulation** announced its intentions to tighten oversight of online platforms and livestream e-commerce as part of a larger initiative aimed at fostering fair competition and providing better protection for smaller businesses. At a press briefing, the regulatory body revealed that the government plans to introduce more stringent measures to enhance the transparency of platform regulations, reduce the operational costs for merchants, and address the growing concerns within the e-commerce ecosystem.
___
**Amazon** is paying $40M to license a new documentary on incoming first lady Melania Trump, who will also serve as executive producer on the film. The price tag includes the film itself, a smaller-scale theatrical run before being featured on Prime Video, and a supplementary docuseries. The documentary will be directed and produced by Brett Ratner, who was forced out of Hollywood at the peak of the #MeToo movement. It is unclear how much Melania will be paid for her contributions.
___
**Mark Zuckerberg** revealed on a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience that Meta and some of the biggest companies in the tech industry will start automating the work of midlevel software engineers this year and eventually outsource all coding on its apps to AI. It may initially be an expensive endeavor, but Zuckerberg said that Meta will reach the point where all of the code in its apps and the AI it generates will also be done by AI. So one question… how will midlevel software engineers become senior software engineers without jobs?
___
**Your brand name on Amazon** can now match your product name, veering from a long-time rule that didn't allow duplicate words in titles, even when the word was part of the brand name. This will allow, for example, The Bean Coffee Company selling a 16 oz Ground Coffee Bag to use the title, “16oz Ground Coffee Bags from The Bean Coffee Company.”
___
**TikTok** is hosting its second annual Global Live Fest on Jan 16th in London, bringing together creators from around the world and featuring musical performances from artists who have come up on TikTok Live. Zara Larsson is set to headline the event, which will be hosted by Jason Derulo and livestreamed to users.
___
**X** launched a standalone iOS app for its Grok chatbot in beta across the US, Australia, and India. The app offers features such as text rewriting, paragraph summarization, Q&A capabilities, and image generation based on text prompts. The company is also preparing a dedicated site, Grok-com, to make the chatbot accessible on the web. Previously Grok was only available to X users until now, and only to X Premium users until this past November.
___
**Kohl's** is closing its Inland Empire e-commerce fulfillment center as well as 27 retail stores across the country by April, with plans to also close its San Bernardino fulfillment center when the facility's lease expires in May. The company claims that it has increased efficiencies with new technology in recent years, allowing it to maintain its ability to fulfill orders with less facilities. (Uh huh…) The company's CEO Tom Kingsbury will step down from the position on Jan 15th, to be replaced by Ashley Buchanan, former CEO of Michaels Companies. 
___
**Meta** has stopped selling its remaining inventory of Quest Pro devices, following its announced plans to discontinue selling the high-end headset two months ago at either the end of the year or when it ran out of stock. The Quest Pro sold for between $1,000 and $1,500 over the short course of its life, and now its product page encourages users to consider the Meta Quest 3 instead, which sells for $500. 
___
**Flipkart** appointed **Kabeer Biswas**, the co-founder of Dunzo, an Indian hyperlocal delivery platform, to lead its quick-commerce service, Minutes. The move follows previous discussions about acquiring Dunzo, which were ultimately hindered by the delivery platform's ownership structure and Reliance Retail's significant investment.
___
**Zalando**, a European e-commerce company specializing in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products, expanded its partnership with **Klarna** by introducing its Pay in 3 installment payment option to five new European markets including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Poland, and The Netherlands. The expansion follows Klarna's launch in France, Italy, and Spain in 2024.
___
**PhishWP**, a WordPress plugin designed by Russian cybercriminals, has been found to turn WordPress websites into phishing pages by creating fake online payment processes that impersonate trusted checkout services like Stripe and stealing customer payment data. Instead of processing payments, the plugin sends credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVVs, billing addresses, and other billing info to a Telegram account controlled by the criminals.

I’m currently working on a fan project 863 movie. Here is a screenshot of one section of the video I’m editing. The date I’m hoping to release this is on August 6th, 2025. (863 day)

The movie storyline and editing are all done by myself only, I’m currently still deciding how long I want this movie to be but I’m hoping to reach for at least an hour long.

I’ll be using concepts like the EAS and small clips from the seasons to tell the story, I might throw in some drawings and text into it. Plus I have some ideas in mind I want to experiment on as well…

I won’t give too much of the plot of the movie, but I’ll give a small hint of the time of the movie: this movie will take place during Season 2 and small bits of Season 3.

The Official title of the movie is “Project: 863 - Code: AMARETTO. Reason for Amaretto is because it’s also another coffee creamer used and sold in stores. Described to taste like almonds.

I would like to hear from you all what ideas/concepts you have in mind that you would love to see and appear in thjs movie, suggestions are appreciated.",2,1736797690.0,MatthiasSubmissions,0,1.0,False

  I'm 30 but I've only been out for a few months. The whole online dating thing isn't really suiting me as the text conversations seem very repetitive and stale. 

  I was having lunch out of town for work when out of the blue this cute guy working in the restaurant asked me out. In my entire life I've never been asked out by a guy or girl so I was ecstatic. We agreed to meet after his shift and exchanged numbers. I was beaming all day. We decided on coffee and a movie.

  I picked him up and we headed to the cafe first. Things were going great it was light, bubbly and relaxed. It really felt like the kind of thing I missed out on growing up. My date was witty, intelligent and gorgeous. He had such a nice laugh and it really warmed my heart every time I managed to make him giggle.

  We got to movie theatre early and picked out the best seats we could. The movie was relatively new so most of the seats were filled. We chatted quietly as the trailers played. This was my first movie date ever and pda makes me fairly self conscious. I wanted to have a cute little moment when the title of the movie was shown on screen and put my arm around my date as this was something I always dreamed about as a teenager as cheesy as it sounds. I was nervous but also excited. When the time cane I went for it. My date gave me a sweet little smile and sort of nuzzled into my shoulder. For a second my heart fluttered; suddenly a group of 4 people directly behind us erupted in a fit of laughter. I heard one of them say ""I told you!! I could tell by the look of them!"". I was just shocked, they laughed for so long and so abnoxiously loud that everyone in the surrounding seats was looking back in our direction and it felt like all eyes were on us. My date sort of withdrew from me and was clearly uncomfortable. I wanted to shrink back into the seat and disappear. We sort of discreetly held hands for the rest of the movie but I was still feeling uneasy. After the film when we walked back to the car I wanted to be romantic and link arms but I just felt too self-conscious.

Why do I feel so embarrassed? I felt so deflated after what was overall a really great date. Is this still internalized homophobia? I really thought I was finally ready to accept myself. I don't know why I care what other people think. I'm ashamed I didn't stick up for us but I didn't know how. If they were outright hostile calling us names or telling us to leave I could have responded in kind. I can't control what other people think and they just thought it was funny we were gay and were douchebags about it.

The colors of the windows and doors can change, and I’m open to having the fireplace painted. The room would be probably dependent on floor lamps and end table lamps for light.

To put it quite simply, I don't think I have the right personality and accomplishments to really connect with others on a professional basis.

Going off of what I know and what my friends have told me, I've been told I'm kind, sweet, empathetic, considerate, loving, loyal, passionate, and brilliant. I show up, I'm committed, I do what I can to help. I like these things, I feel like they're good traits for making friends and relationships.

Hi internet stranger ! I’m just a girl (cue the song ) . I’m hoping to meet a dumbass who is into dumbassery just as much as I am . Some one to text and share stupid stuff with on the daily .So if you have a dash of dumbassery , a galactic twinkle in your eye and think you’re able to hold a conversation let’s be friends ;) 

First abit about me : I’m writing this while drinking coffee at 21:21 I’m watching a Dutch streamer play phasmophobia .sometimes I’m funny but don’t ask me to tell a joke ( that’s not how it works bro ) fun fact I hate movies and also ice cream( no I don’t have reasons why I just don’t , it’s not that deep ). I have adhd and because of that I have a new hobby or interest each week . I like reading watching the most random shit on YouTube , baking , walking , making a million playlists that I’ll never listen to again and adding them to my iPod for optimal vibes  and journaling. I speak 3 languages and am learning a 4th ! I love dogs 100% but cats 101% .that’s about it nothing special . 

**Things to expect if we become friends**

- Goodmorning messages (might not be sent in the morning )
- a lot of random playlist I’ve made 
- complaints about nonsensical things
- someone that you can annoy at any time of  the day 
- someone to have coffee dates with virtually 
- just someone willing to listen to your rambles /ideas/thoughts/feelings

**DONT JUST SEND ME HI /HELLO/HEY/HOW ARE YOU ? If you do this I probably won’t answer so please send me a none boring intro (not just listing your hobbies pretty please )**

SUMMARY AT BOTTOM - hope it helps anyone who is currently in the desperation of die-off. ,"Four months ago I started my journey through hell and back as I began to fight the gaslighting monster that is candida.I’ve dreamed of the moment I could say this…I have found relief.

If you are in the pits of despair right now, I am here for you.

I know you are probably feeling like you are a shell of yourself and questioning if there is any possibility for a brighter reality. This fungal overgrowth wrecks your mind. It made me irrationally angry. It made me impulsive and dopamine crazed. All the while your brain tricks you into thinking that you're just naturally becoming a horrid version of yourself.

I'm here to tell you, I am only one month into relief and my real self has RETURNED. I feel levels of cheerfulness and optimism that I hadn't in *years*. Most importantly, I feel immense *gratitude towards myself* for trusting that I actually had this controversial illness. *I changed my life.* It's extremely difficult, tedious, and slow but I stayed the course until I found my formula. You are changing your life as we speak. **Persist.**

 

NOTE: This post is more about the **mental effects of Candida,** see my other post for details on supplement/anti-fungal specifics and see brief bullet points at very bottom of regimen. Feel free to comment or dm me.

This is a letter to myself to my past-self based on 4 months of experience.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear self,

These are going to be some of the hardest months of your life so far. Physically, you're going to  
battle migraines, fatigue, and most significant of all, a feeling of being *absolutely alone and hopeless* in your health journey. You will wake up countless nights with your ears ringing, heart beating fast, and mind racing. You will question if this is just a forgotten trauma reaction, if it's""quackery,"" and at your worst, if this is some hidden terminal  
illness.

Despite it all, you must firmly BELIEVE that you will get better or else it is not possible. Even on your worst  
days, tell yourself “This is horrible, but I will figure this out. I will get better.” Many, many people abandon their reddit posts because they GOT BETTER. After your second month of continued bouts of die-off you will feel it’s hopeless but it is NOT. PERSIST.

No one is going to understand what you’re going through. You need to immediately **lower your expectations for empathy**. Feel empathy for yourself and make a resolve to do what is needed. Say no and no and no again, without guilt. Most times they won't understand why you need to cancel, or you won't go on a certain trip, but you *don't need to explain yourself.* Just do what you need to do...the rest of  
**your life depends on these months.**

**Reddit threads will become the most encouraging resource you have.** Reading about others people's extremely similar symptoms and their healing journeys will push you into not gas-lighting yourself and remind you that this isn't a phantom mental illness, it's ***real.*** You will feel like a horrible friend, you will be worried your partner is going to leave you, and you will question if you're turning into heartless bastard sometimes... it's all OKAY. You are not a bad person, you are just *fully prioritizing yourself* for a time so you can put all your resources into healing. This isn't forever, and people will forgive you for retreating into your own isolated hole WAY quicker than you think.

Doctors (traditional) are not going to be your solution for this. The solution is taking the time to **get to know your body and your gut** ***intimately***. Your GP doc will tell you the solution is to *start to journal your menstrual cycle* every month. Give her a soft smile and resist the urge to scream.

**You are not a weak, victim-centric, neurologically screwed-up person.** Your brain is inflamed (fyi both before and after treatment as candida causes inflammation and treating it causes all your defenses to ramp up). Who knows how long you’ve been pushing through and operating on strained brain capacity. In a couple months you will realize you’re becoming yourself again.

Mentally, you must, must, must **fully commit to healing.** This needs to be the most **important thing in your life.** Everything else, aka your career goals, the state of your marriage, your ability to go and  
feel alive at a concert, your ability to travel and experience new places, your ability to harness your creativity, your ability to have fulfilling friendships, your ability to have an actual good night of sleep again....ALL depends on your healing.

You will have to have **to cut sugar. And coffee. And most carbs. And alcohol.** Constantly remind yourself that sugar feeds all cancers, inflammation and so if it means it will help you think clearly and be happier again...it's WORTH IT. The dopamine hit is not worth it. If you want to go to live shows, have casual drinks with friends, and enjoy a fancy dessert in the future, *you have to sacrifice for this time period.*

You will in fact spend hundreds of hours reading, researching, listening to youtube videos and basically becoming your own functional health expert. Every word you read (with the exceptions of rabbit-hole theories *see below*) will ***help***. You will become an expert analyzer of your stool consistency (and urine too). You will see both candida AND biofilms in your stool and you will get giddy knowing that you're  
*not crazy.* You will fight revulsion as you look at others' stool pics online but then feel relief when you see pretty much *exact* matches to what you're dealing with. The **physical proof does not lie.**

You will get ***paranoid*** about many things, including but not limited to parasite infestation, mold-exposure, autoimmune disease, covid-vaccine reaction, MCAS genetics, cancer, ptsd, and you will get a bit obsessive. This is part of the mental die-off effects. Your brain is so desperate for answers it's acting like a stimulated wild rabbit that clings to any possible explanation. Take deep breaths, *do not* discuss your dozens of theories with other people (lol), and remember there is no ***quick solution*** to anything in life. This will be a multi-month/maybe year(s)-long trial and error process that your life depends on.

Try many supplements BUT try and refrain from ordering ***anything*** when you are in the pits of a die-off episode. You will have 20-30 different supplements now sitting unused on your shelf that you ordered when your brain was in a fog of drunk-candida haze and die-off pain. Don't complicate it too much. W**rite out your symptoms constantly**  your brain starts to recognize the 3 or 4 MAIN symptoms and directs your attention towards the right reddit posts, medical studies, etc.

Calm your nervous system **throughout the day.** You mind will be so overwhelmed and inflamed that  
meditation will feel almost impossible. Reading mindfulness books for 10 or 20 minutes a day will provide a bit of grounding. Lay down for 10 minutes throughout day and deep breathe. Go outside and talk a walk. Listen to soft music. You MUST do everything you can to calm your nervous system during this time as your inflammation and emotions will be a rollercoaster.

Do not expect ***to feel happy and yourself.*** Do not expect yourself to be productive, to get extra projects done, to have a clean and organized house, to host people like usual. Your body and mind are in a BATTLE. ***Accept*** that you’re in a hard place, take care of yourself and KNOW that it’s just temporary. The cheerfulness, optimism, and general positivity for life that you vaguely remember WILL come back. (from current day self….it’s back baby).

After months of trying everything, dozens of supplements and vitamins, experiencing harsh die-off effects, you will finally find a formula that give you sweet, sweet RELIEF. You will feel joy almost immediately and you will be able to eat a variety of things again. You had to put in the work to find what works for your gut/body specifically. But you did it, and now your life is starting to *return to a normal you forgot existed.* Your sex drive is returning, you're not over stimulated as easily, your tolerance for loud noises and people is expanding, your gratitude and curiosity for life is increasing with every day. People will even tell you that you look better, *more awake.*

 

SUMMARY (lol this “sum up” is longer than I intended but I tried):

1.     You must BELIEVE that you will get better or else it is not possible. Even on your worst days, tell yourself “This is horrible, but I will figure this out. I will get better.”

2.     Don’t expect empathy. You need to show empathy to yourself and be strong in your resolve to put yourself first for a period of time while you figure this out.

3.     Read reddit threads. They will become the greatest resource to believe in you intuition about this illness (so you don’t gaslight yourself) and your ability to believe in healing.

4.     Doctors (traditional) will disappoint you and write off your symptoms as mentally fabricated. Don’t get discouraged and stay dedicated to taking accountability for your own health. When you start to heal you’ll think back and know you were RIGHT.

5.     Get to know your body and your gut *intimately*. Pay attention to all triggers (things like food, caffeine, even body lotion etc.) You’ll begin to notice things you always blocked out (such as histamine intolerance) and you’ll begin to trust your bodies alarm signals.

6.     You are not a weak, victim-centric, neurologically screwed-up person. Your tired brain will bully you and weaken your self-esteem. Remember who you used to be and *trust* that you will be that person again just not right now and it’s OKAY (you may even be better than you were before as you might have been unknowingly battling this for *years*, even decades). You’re not an angry person that’s just angry candida dying off. Try not to react to the people around you during this time.

7.     Healing must become the most important thing in your life for this time period. Don’t get distracted by a dream trip, a seemingly complicated marriage, a new restaurant that opened up, remember that you need a strict temporary lifestyle to beat this thing. Don’t expect to feel happy or like yourself for awhile. *Accept* this is a low point but it’s necessary for you to become yourself again.

8.     Calm your nervous system in any way that you can. Music, deep breathing, walks in nature. It helps so much more than you think to aid the supplements/anti-fungals to do their thing.

9.     It’s all worth it. You found your magic formula. Every sacrifice you made brought you to this day. Your life can start to begin again.

The way I got into it was mostly luck (a cousins partner worked there), and I had no prior experience, nor a college degree. The company is huge, and i'm in the marketing department, kind of - and also most likely the only one without a degree. I've been 'faking' my way through the last 5 years. I have no interest in the actual role itself and find it incredibly hard to stay motivated and focused (as I write this post during work hours). The only times I get jazzed up are when I am doing something creative (editing a video for the team, etc.). It's a work from home job, which is great at times, but now that my Fiancee is in the office 5x/week it's getting pretty lonely. I don't have many meetings either so I catch myself just waiting for lunch and waiting for 5PM. Those are the main highlights of my day. And I don't want to do that anymore!

I feel like I am in this position of confusion and lack of direction. I want to leave my job because nothing about it excites me, but I don't have a degree so i'm not sure what to do. I've applied to a hundred random linkedin jobs and got nothing, obviously. I struggle to start a work project because I subconsciously don't want to forget about the goal of quitting, and if I sink my teeth into something i'll lose sight of that. I'm behind on tasks because of that. I also haven't learned anything the entire time.

I mainly want to prepare espresso-based beverages and only occasionally pour over or french press.

I want to start with a decent grinder and am currently aiming at the 1Zpresso J-Ultra due to its espresso focus, adjustability and design esthetics.

I have a few questions:
1. Researching espresso gear is a bit of a rabbit hole, what buyer's remorse could I encounter with this grinder?
2. Is it correct to generalize that this hand grinder provides more control than an electric grinder in the same price range?
3. I'd prefer a buy-once/use for years approach (if applicable in the 200$-class). Is company longevity a concern with regards to parts availability (e.g. burr grinder wear off etc)?
4. The J-Ultra is geared towards espresso due to its small step sizes, but why do people sometimes post that it's not suitable for occasional pour-overs or french press coffee? If it can grind fine, it can be adjusted to grind a little coarser too I guess?

The way I got into it was mostly luck (a cousins partner worked there), and I had no prior experience, nor a college degree. The company is huge, and i'm in the marketing department, kind of - and also most likely the only one without a degree. I've been 'faking' my way through the last 5 years. I have no interest in the actual role itself and find it incredibly hard to stay motivated and focused (as I write this post during work hours). The only times I get jazzed up are when I am doing something creative (editing a video for the team, etc.). It's a work from home job, which is great at times, but now that my Fiancee is in the office 5x/week it's getting pretty lonely. I don't have many meetings either so I catch myself just waiting for lunch and waiting for 5PM. Those are the main highlights of my day. And I don't want to do that anymore!

I feel like I am in this position of confusion and lack of direction. I want to leave my job because nothing about it excites me, but I don't have a degree so i'm not sure what to do. I've applied to a hundred random linkedin jobs and got nothing, obviously. I struggle to start a work project because I subconsciously don't want to forget about the goal of quitting, and if I sink my teeth into something i'll lose sight of that.

I personally like my coffee sweet and made with milk. 

Okay now rant! I asked the pop up coffee stand for an iced coffee with the syrups I wanted ect ect and asked for lactose free milk. The lady was confused and asked me if I still wanted coffee in it and I was like yes??? 

So I pay and I'm waiting for my drink to be made at one of the little cocktail tables they have when I hear the cashier lady tell the other girl who was making the coffees that to make an iced coffee it's just expresso, water, and a splash of milk. The coffee was good but it tasted so watered down. 


Typically, when I make iced coffees at my batista side gig you could call it, I make the espresso into a ""jug"" and put ice and milk into one of our cups and then put the espresso on top. That's how I make it, that's how I was tought to make it(I think it'd actually), that's what I expected my drink to be made??

Now, I should also say that I don't actually have a clue to how the coffee world runs. It took me like two months to memorize the difference between a venti and a grande.

I was lucky to get on Ayvakit within a few weeks, and I have had steady care since. I have only recently begun to participate in this sub, and it has helped a great deal as I navigate some prolonged plateaus and moving to a new city with no support system. In that spirit, I wanted to share an experience I had this morning:

The McKesson rep called me this morning, and we went through our normal ritual. We get to the end, and they asked if I had any questions. Never had any before, but I decided to clarify something about the no food two hours before or one hour after taking medication rule.

While I have been strict in adhering to the food rule, I have continued to drink coffee. I take my coffee with milk…🫠🫥

The nurse confirmed that milk counted as a food (obviously) and could adversely impact my body’s ability to absorb the Ayvakit, as well as the other drugs I have been prescribed to manage my symptoms. She and I had a good laugh, but I felt very, very dumb. 

After taking a walk with my dogs and reflecting on the news that I’ve been working against my meds for the last 18 months or so, I also feel  grateful for this information.

Coming to terms with my diagnosis was difficult enough, but learning to accept that this journey is not linear has been one of the biggest challenges for me. In reading all of your stories and seeing the way this community supports its own, moments like this feel more manageable and less devastating than they would’ve 18 months ago. 

Thanks everyone, and I hope this could give you a little chuckle today.

P.S. Coffee w/o sugar or milk or anything added is okay to drink right before/after you take your Ayvakit, according to this nurse 🙃

Let me preface this by saying that me and this girl had been friends for roughly 2-3 years. I think that I was one of her few close friends in a small social circle and we talked regularly; conversations were easy and there were days we could pass completely in intermittent chatting. Our humor and interests completely aligned. Although I never verbally acknowledged it, she was aware I had a crush on her. It was obvious and her best friend had gone as far as to ask her why she didn't date me when I, in her friend's words, was better than her (at the time current) boyfriend and obviously cared deeply about her. I was told that she didn't really respond, she just shut the topic down and ignored it. Regardless, we remained friends for years, although we only ever hung out in groups once she realized my feelings for her.

It eventually came to a point where I realized my crush was going nowhere. I was sick of pining over her and waiting for her to be single and wanted to do more with my life. My replies started taking longer (but never more than a few hours) and there were bigger gaps in our conversations. I started feeling awkward and then one day she just stopped replying in the middl of a conversation. There was no read receipt; it was like she just didn't open the chat again. I wasn't going to re-prompt her so left it up to her. A week turned into a month, which turned into a year. I eventually accepted that she'd gotten bored of me or something and then years passed. I eventually attempted to reach back out 5 years after we last talked. She left the message on read for a week, at which point I fully accepted she didn't care and unfriended her.

Now, 9 years later (4 years after I tried to reach out) I get a friend request and message at 3am. It doesn't explain anything, it isn't a hey, it's just a kind of random expression of excitement. I say “hey, what's up”, and am left on read for 4 days. I haven't used messenger regularly in years so worry that the new encryption feature is dropping my message. I ask if she got it and say that I think messenger is fucking up. This message is also left on read for several days. I, finally, about a week after her initial message, get a reply from her, saying “how the heck has life been?!” I'm confused and now even more certain that my messages are being dropped, but I reply and see what happens.

This message is also left on read for several days. I decide to post my number on her wall (posts on her wall are private) and tell her to text me instead. I get a reply on messenger a few days later, addressing my response to ""how the heck has life been?!"" like nothing had happened. She doesn't address either of my questions about my messages being received. She instead asks me to share my art projects with her. I'm even more confused at this point but go ahead. Again, left on read for several days, until she replies to one of the things I linked with “this was actually really good. props to you”. No questions about me, shares nothing about herself, doesn't continue the conversation at all. Zero engagement. At this point I'm now frustrated and upset at being given 'props' for something that's really dear to me. It's been two weeks at that point and we haven't had a single conversation. The dynamic is so weird I'm wondering all the time why she even bothered reaching out.

I'm upset and don't reply for several days. She doesn't add anything further in that time, and so I ask her straight up, “why did you message me after all these years?” This message is left on read a week. I re-prompt her, saying “well I assume something is going on, I'm here if you ever wanna talk,” and she replies quickly saying “you were always such a good friend I wanted to reach back out.” My initial reaction was that that response shouldn't take a week and being re-prompted to give me.

Yet somehow, that was the beginning of the sole conversation we had reconnecting. Idk what happened, but things were suddenly like how they used to be. We were replying to each other instantly and were both visibly excited to be talking. We were both trying to share so much of what had happened over the past decade that we couldn't get a point in before the other replied with something else. I asked her out for coffee and she agreed immediately and went on about how excited she was to see me again. We talked like that for an hour, and I had to actually try multiple times to end the conversation since I had to go out. It was at that point that I felt that the hurdle of whatever the past 3 weeks were had been crossed and that maybe we were actually arriving at something. I should note that I had no feelings these first 3 weeks. I was curious but wasn't sure if my feelings for her would even return, let alone grow into something more. But at this point I was suddenly faced with the feeling that something significant was happening. We're both in our early 30s and our conversation seemed so frantic and full of excitement that it seemed inevitable our hanging out would lead to more.

Well, two days later she no-shows coffee. I've never been stood up in my life, let alone by somebody I knew for years, and so was more deeply confused than hurt. This was a month into reconnection. I point blank asked her at that point if she was interested because her behavior had been nothing but avoidant and confusing and I couldn't see what else would drive her to act like that. Normally I'd assume someone just wasn't interested but she was the one who reached out. She had been so excited during our chat. I told her not to bring my feelings back if she was gonna do this.

I didn't get a reply for several days, and when I did she was apologetic, said she fucked up, and gave me some explanation about having a flat tire which triggered some trauma from a car accident the year before. But I didn't really understand what she was saying and her explanation was jumbled and when I asked if she was okay she said “I'm really not”, then immediately withdrew for another week. I was already in the process of my feelings returning which I couldn't really stop, and her withdrawing intensified them. They grew over that week and I eventually told her that my feelings had returned and that I was telling her because I wanted to be honest if she intended to keep talking to me. She replied a few days later apologizing for a “little meltdown” but didn't acknowledge my confession of feelings at all.

The following two months saw a gradual expression of my feelings in more and more explicit terms. I wasn't love-bombing her; her strange avoidance of conversation and further attempts to hang out would lead to increasingly emotional exchanges between us and I would then express my feelings more clearly to give her yet another chance to turn me down. But she wouldn't, and that would in turn fuel my hope that something was there. It didn't help that she'd say something every once in awhile like “Happy Thanksgiving <3” which would leave me even more unsure of her intentions before disappearing again.

I ended up giving her an ultimatum about two months in, telling her I was extremely confused, romantically interested, and that if she couldn't communicate I had to move on for my own well-being. Again, it took nearly a week for a reply, which was her telling me she was a fuck-up and wasn't good at being a friend and that ""you will always mean so much to me"" and kept apologizing. She said “we will stay in contact and we will hang out again”. She again did not acknowledge my expressed feelings, only ended the conversation with “I will try to be better. Thanks for still wanting to be my friend and around”.

The rest of December followed with little change. She didn't wish me a happy birthday, she didn't tell me Merry Christmas. She seemed to be growing more distant even though at the same time she was now attempting to start conversations. She'd send me lyrics from our favorite band at 3am, or tell me they were playing on the bar speakers (again in the middle of the night). She told me she wanted to hang after New Years, she was “just working rn”. When Christmas came I asked if she was free the weekend after New Years. She left it on read following a conversation that had been up to that point nothing but frequent responses.

So I just told her, “if you're not interested you actually just need to tell me”, but she left that on read too. I fail to understand how I could have given her a better opportunity to just stop everything there. But she didn't reply for days, until at 1am I get, “duuuuuuuuudeeeeee, Brand New playing at the bar”.

I felt like I was in an alternate dimension where I had become fucking insane or delusional. I literally could not understand how someone could just utterly refuse to engage with reality and pretend I had never asked what I did, while at the same time continuing to reach out to me. Nothing in me could convince me that she was just flat-out disinterested, because I couldn't honestly think of someone so afraid of rejecting somebody that they would behave to this extent.

I left it on read, planning to just stop there, but stupidly told her “happy new year” the day after. I was right on the cusp of unfriending her when she replied the morning after with “happy new years, I'll send you some days to hang”. I said ok, hoping that maybe for once she was actually going to try, and suggested plans, which she left on read. 5 days passed at which point I told her that I shouldn't hang out with her and that this wasn't good for me. She said “Obviously I reached out at a bad time.” I told her I'd been doing good when this started and that hurt her and I asked if she was worried about hurting me. She said that that was her fear, and when I pressed how she thought she'd hurt me she said “just by reaching out”. I told her “it's like you don't even realize you're one of the people I've liked the most in my life,” and said she didn't understand how happy I'd been to see she'd reached back out after 9 years.

“idk what to say”, was her reply. I told her she didn't have to say anything, I just wanted her to know it. I told her she was precious to me and that she shouldn't hesitate out of fear of hurting me because I was there precisely because I wanted her in my life.

That was the last thing she ever said to me. I messaged her a few days later to tell her I was muting messenger for a few weeks to work on some projects and that I'd like to take her on a date when I was done. She left it on read. Yesterday, my first day of muting messenger, my friend discovered her profile on Hinge. I immediately told her to forget everything and said that I didn't know why she ever told me she cared because I'd never felt so underappreciated in my life, wished her good luck with everything, and blocked her. I didn't wait for a reply, nor did I mention the hinge account.

I know I'll never have this connection with somebody again, at least as far as past history and feelings go. It feels like our reconnection happened at a point in our life where something serious could have began and I think she felt that too which led to her immediately shutting down. She told me “I shouldn't have reached out if I wasn't ready, I'm sorry”. But I don't know what that means. I don't know what anything she did means. She told me nothing, and from before I even said ""what's up"" it seemed like she had been shutting the connection down, even though she was the one who reached out. I wonder if she feared the strength of it or something and panicked, and that hurts almost more than the thought of her being disinterested. I think she is very recently out of a relationship and I know she's struggled with social anxiety and relationships and drinking in the past. I know our one good conversation was while she was drinking, and it seemed like she was only ever at bars when she messaged me.

Thanks for reading. I'd just like any sort of clarity on what I experienced.",1,1736795810.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1i0lz36,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i0lz36,Opinions on layout?,"We have a pretty small 1100sqft house. I’ve never been quite satisfied with the layout of our living room or felt we utilized the space the best. It can get cluttered pretty quickly. My kiddo is home sick from school which is helpful because this is how things usually look. Kid on the floor playing, dogs on the furniture and us trying to squeeze in somewhere lol. The TV is mounted on that wall and we have installed wires behind the wall so it’s most likely staying there. 

Any decor recommendations? I feel like the rug should maybe be bigger. It just looks awkward to me. We’ve also had a coffee table before and it just doesn’t work for us. We prefer to use the end tables.

Last picture is of our trash/recycling cabinet. My husband built it so it’s pretty sturdy and obviously I don’t want to get rid of something he worked hard on but is it weird that it overlaps our flooring like that?

# The AI Revolution is Here

If you think the idea of AI cutting down the time to find and fix errors by 100 times sounds like science fiction, think again. It’s not just a futuristic fantasy; it’s the rapidly approaching reality of software engineering.

In 2025, [**Meta**](https://www.meta.com/) (formerly Facebook) predicts that AI will be capable of acting as a mid-level engineer, writing code that can transform the software landscape. This isn’t just a minor tweak to the way we work; it’s a seismic shift that will change how software is built, how teams operate, and even how we think about jobs in the tech industry.

But what does this mean for you? Let me explain how AI Accelerates Software Engineering…

# What Does AI-Driven Change Mean for Your Scrum Team and Developers?

If you’re a software engineer, a student, or someone interested in the tech world, understanding this shift is crucial. It’s not just about keeping up with the latest trends; it’s about positioning yourself for success in a world where AI is an integral part of the development process.

In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into this fascinating topic, exploring what it means for the future of software engineering, Scrum teams, how it will impact the job market, and what you can do to stay ahead of the curve. So, grab a coffee, settle in, and let’s explore the future together.

# The AI-Powered Future What Meta is Predicting

Let’s start with the big picture. Meta, one of the world’s leading tech companies, has made some bold predictions about the future of AI in software engineering. According to [**Mark Zuckerberg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg), by 2025, AI will be capable of acting as a mid-level engineer, writing code that can transform the software landscape.

**But what does that really mean?**

Essentially, it means that AI will be able to handle a significant portion of the coding tasks that are currently performed by human engineers. This isn’t just about automating repetitive tasks; it’s about AI generating complex code, designing software architectures, and even debugging issues.

Think about it: if AI can write code as effectively as a mid-level engineer, it could drastically reduce the time and resources needed to develop software. This could lead to faster product development cycles, lower costs, and ultimately, more innovative products.

# The Evolution of Software Development

To understand the impact of AI on software engineering, it’s important to look at the evolution of software development itself. For decades, software has been built by humans, line by line, with engineers painstakingly crafting code to bring their ideas to life.

But as technology has advanced, so too have the tools available to engineers. From integrated development environments (IDEs) to version control systems, these tools have made the development process more efficient. However, they still require human input at every step.

AI changes the game. Instead of simply assisting humans, AI can now generate code from scratch, based on high-level instructions or even natural language prompts. This isn’t just an incremental improvement; it’s a paradigm shift.

If you are a Product Owner in a Scrum team, responsible for maximizing the value of your product. You have a new feature in mind that you want to introduce to enhance user experience. In the past, you would work closely with the Developers to define the requirements, and then they would handle the coding and testing processes.

With the integration of AI into your development workflow, the process becomes even more efficient. Instead of detailing every aspect of the feature, you can now describe the feature’s functionality in plain English, focusing on the “what” rather than the “how.”

The Developers then utilize AI tools to generate the code based on your description. This not only accelerates the development process but also allows the team to focus on higher-level problem-solving and innovation. As a Product Owner, you can now spend more time on backlog refinement, ensuring that the features align with stakeholder expectations and business goals.  
This streamlined approach not only enhances collaboration between the Product Owner and the Developers but also leads to faster delivery of high-quality software, ultimately maximizing the value delivered to the end-users.

This doesn’t mean that human engineers will become obsolete.

On the contrary, it means that their roles will evolve. Instead of writing code, engineers will focus on higher-level tasks like designing systems, solving complex problems, and ensuring that the AI-generated code meets the necessary standards.

# The Economic and Societal Implications

The impact of AI on software engineering extends far beyond the technical aspects. It has significant economic and societal implications as well.

One of the most pressing concerns is the impact on employment. If AI can perform the tasks of mid-level engineers, what does that mean for the millions of people who work in software development? Will they lose their jobs, or will new opportunities emerge?

Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI will create more jobs than it eliminates, much like how the industrial revolution led to the creation of new industries and professions. He points out that 100 years ago, the majority of the workforce was involved in agriculture, but today, only a small percentage of the population is needed to produce enough food for everyone.

Similarly, Zuckerberg argues that as AI takes over routine tasks, it will free up humans to pursue more creative and fulfilling work. This could lead to a significant increase in productivity, as well as a shift in the types of jobs that are available.

But it’s not all smooth sailing. The transition to an AI-driven world won’t be without its challenges. There will be a period of adjustment, during which some people may lose their jobs, and others may need to retrain for new roles. This is why it’s crucial for individuals, companies, and governments to prepare for the future.

# The Role of Human Creativity in an AI-Driven World

One of the most exciting aspects of this shift is the potential for human creativity to flourish. As AI takes over routine tasks, humans will be free to focus on what they do best: creating, innovating, and solving complex problems.

Imagine a world where engineers can spend more time on high-level design, where product managers can focus on user experience, and where developers can explore new technologies without being bogged down by mundane coding tasks. This is the world that AI could help create.

But this doesn’t mean that technical skills will become irrelevant. On the contrary, they will become even more important. As AI becomes more integrated into the development process, engineers will need to have a deep understanding of how these systems work, how to train them, and how to ensure that they are producing high-quality code.

In addition, there will be a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between AI and human teams. These individuals will be responsible for ensuring that AI-generated code meets the necessary standards, that it is secure, and that it aligns with the overall vision of the product.

# The Importance of Lifelong Learning

In a world where AI is increasingly involved in software development, lifelong learning will be more important than ever. As the industry evolves, so too will the skills that are in demand. Engineers who are willing to adapt, learn new technologies, and embrace change will be the ones who thrive.

This doesn’t just apply to engineers, either. As AI becomes more prevalent in the workplace, everyone from product managers to designers will need to have a basic understanding of how these systems work and how they can be leveraged to create better products.

One of the best ways to stay ahead of the curve is to keep learning. Whether it’s through [**online courses**](https://www.whatisscrum.org/courses/), industry conferences, or simply experimenting with new tools and technologies, continuous learning will be key to success in the AI-driven world. As you expand your knowledge, I encourage you to explore how AI can be applied to risk management.

[**My book, Next-Gen Risk Management with AI**](https://dejan-majkic.thinkific.com/products/digital_downloads/next-ge-risk-management-with-ai), offers actionable insights and real-world examples of how to leverage AI to predict, prevent, and manage risks in an uncertain world. Download the eBook now to unlock these strategies and enhance your professional toolkit.

# The Role of AI in Entrepreneurship

Another exciting aspect of this shift is the potential for AI to empower entrepreneurs and small businesses. In the past, building a software product required a significant investment in talent and resources. But with AI, it’s possible to build sophisticated applications with far fewer people.

In fact, [**Sam Altman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman), the CEO of OpenAI, has predicted that we will see our first billion-dollar company founded by a single person, thanks to the power of AI. This is a testament to the transformative potential of AI in the world of entrepreneurship.  
For aspiring entrepreneurs, this means that the barriers to entry are lower than ever. With the right ideas and the right tools, it’s possible to build a successful business without a large team of engineers. This could lead to a surge in innovation, as more people are able to bring their ideas to life.

But it’s not just about building products; it’s also about solving problems. As AI becomes more prevalent, there will be a growing need for entrepreneurs who can identify pain points and develop solutions that meet the needs of consumers.

# The Role of AI in the Job Market

So, what does all of this mean for the job market? Will AI lead to widespread unemployment, or will it create new opportunities for workers?

The answer is likely somewhere in the middle. While AI will undoubtedly replace some jobs, it will also create new ones. The key is to focus on the skills that are in demand and to be proactive about acquiring them.

For example, as AI takes over routine coding tasks, there will be a growing need for engineers who can work with AI systems, train them, and ensure that they are producing high-quality code. There will also be a need for professionals who can bridge the gap between AI and human teams, ensuring that the technology is used effectively.

In addition, there will be new opportunities in fields like data science, machine learning, and AI ethics. These are areas that are likely to see significant growth in the coming years, as companies seek to leverage the power of AI while also ensuring that it is used responsibly.

# Embrace the Future of Software Engineering

As we’ve explored the transformative impact of AI on Scrum teams and software development, it’s evident that the future is both bright and uncertain. The integration of AI into our workflows presents significant opportunities for innovation and efficiency, but it also challenges us to adapt and evolve our roles and practices.

Given these transformative changes, it’s clear that the future of software engineering is on the brink of a significant shift. While the path ahead is filled with uncertainties, it also brims with opportunities for growth and innovation. The key to navigating this future successfully lies in our ability to be proactive, stay informed, and embrace continuous learning.

For those willing to embrace this change, the rewards are substantial. Whether you’re a seasoned engineer, a student just starting out, or an entrepreneur with a great idea, AI offers incredible potential to create something truly groundbreaking. By positioning yourself as a lifelong learner and adaptability champion, you can thrive in this new landscape.

To help you on this journey, consider [**downloading my book “Next-Gen Risk Management with AI,”**](https://dejan-majkic.thinkific.com/products/digital_downloads/next-ge-risk-management-with-ai) which delves into how AI can be harnessed to predict, prevent, and manage risks effectively. This resource is designed to unlock the power of AI in risk management, providing actionable insights and real-world examples to enhance your professional toolkit.

Remember, the future of software engineering is not something to fear but to embrace. By learning about AI, experimenting with new tools, and staying open to new possibilities, you can position yourself for success in an AI-driven world. Let’s embrace this exciting future together, where human creativity and AI-powered efficiency combine to drive innovation and excellence in software development.

# The Power of AI in Your Hands

As we’ve seen, AI is not just a tool; it’s a game-changer. It has the potential to revolutionize the way we build software, the way we work, and even the way we think about jobs and careers.

But it’s important to remember that AI is not a magic solution.

It’s a tool that needs to be used wisely, with care and consideration. As engineers, as entrepreneurs, and as members of society, it’s our responsibility to ensure that AI is used in a way that benefits everyone.

Was there an expectation for you to attend higher education? Did you participate in any form of higher education? If yes, how did you pay for it?
Yes, it was expected that I attend college. My parents did not, and their wish for me and my sister was that we obtained degrees. I was not a stellar high school student and did not apply for any scholarships. My parents paid on the condition that I go to a state school, and I chose an inexpensive (at the time) 4 year state university.

Growing up, what kinds of conversations did you have about money? Did your parents/guardians educate you about finances?
Yes, it was always stressed to me the importance of working and saving towards your goals. I received a small allowance as a child but was able to earn a small amount more (usually $5) for doing certain chores outside of my normal chores. I was not allowed to get my driver’s license until I had job. I knew money was tight in my family and we had enough for food and shelter and necessities, but not a lot of extravagances. We didn’t go on family trips, and when I wanted to travel with school groups I had to fundraise and pay for it myself.

What was your first job and why did you get it?
My first job was a paper route when I was 13, but my actual first job was at Dairy Queen when I was 16. Getting a job in fast food was a normal thing to do as a teen in my area, and Dairy Queen seemed like the most fun. I worked there my junior and senior years of high school, and summers when I came home from college.

Did you worry about money growing up?
No. I knew money was tight but my parents always shielded me. My mom was only able to work part time due to an injury for the last 10 years of her career. But I had everything I needed, and I knew if I wanted something special I could work and pay for it myself.

Do you worry about money now?
For the most part, no. We live within our means in a medium cost of living city, and have a decent amount of savings and retirement. I know that we need to get life insurance and that stresses me out but I keep putting it off.

At what age did you become financially responsible for yourself and do you have a financial safety net?
I became financially responsible at 21 when I graduated college. I got a job right after graduating and moved into my own apartment with roommates. I know that if I had money issues I could ask my Dad for a loan.

Do you or have you ever received passive or inherited income?
I know my Dad puts money in a savings account in my name, but I don’t know how much is in it and I have never touched it. My Mom passed away a few years ago but I wouldn’t have accepted any of her money. It belongs to my Dad. When my Dad passes he will probably leave me his house and some savings, but I don’t want to think about that because he is going to live forever.

Day One

7:00 am – I wake up and miraculously, my 2.5-year-old son V. is still asleep. Make coffee (During the pandemic we splurged on a Moccamaster which was an amazing decision. Not only is the coffee great, it brews a full pot in like two minutes), and do Wordle in bed.

8:00 – my son is up, and it’s already scorching hot outside. I need to do yard work, so I set up the water table for him to play with while M. makes waffles for breakfast. The hose is more fun than the water table, and I end up soaked. We eat waffles, bacon, and fruit outside on the patio.

9:30 – R., one of my oldest friends, texts and asks if I want to go to a local Mexican festival. We were planning on going anyway, but it will be so much more fun with a friend. Enthusiastically reply YES! And get to work on figuring out how to set up the bike trailer (hand me down from a friend). The festival is about 2 miles away and it will be so much easier to bike than drive. Once that is settled, I hop in the shower, and since it’s the first time I’ve gone anywhere fun all week, I do my hair and makeup. Struggle getting dressed because I’m 17 weeks pregnant and everything is starting to not fit. Settle on a white sundress and black Tevas. Check Target’s app to see if they have any athletic sandals that are a little bit cuter, but everything is sold out in my size. End up looking at Old Navy, where I don’t find sandals but order 10 pairs of underwear in a larger size, plus a pair of clearance maternity leggings, and a cute Fall dress that is not maternity but should work. My order is over $50 so I get free shipping. ($90.13)

11:40 – after a few false starts and some screaming from V., we are on the bike trail on our way to the fest. M. pays for tickets ($28 total) while I get in line. We are hungry so M. orders a taco platter for us to share ($20), and a quesadilla with beans and rice for the kid ($10). After we eat, M. orders drinks for us – a beer for him, a soda for me, and horchata for the kid ($18 with tip). The fest is great and we listen to some music, check out the market, and let V. go on a couple rides ($6).

3:30 – everyone is hot and tired and so we leave the fest. On the bike ride home, we come across “Milwaukee’s First Oktoberfest” (I had to laugh because it is currently August, but people in Milwaukee love any excuse to drink outdoors). We stop and get beers - regular for M., N/A for me ($13). M. and I enjoy the band while V. plays in the woodchips with his toy dump truck.

5:00 – we get home quickly as a storm is about to hit. I sit on the porch and watch the storm roll in while M. and V. play inside. M. is craving some German food after our impromptu Oktoberfest trip, and I have a Blue Apron recipe I can doctor a bit (meal kit in monthly expenses). I use the contents of the kit plus my own panko and seasoning to make pork Schnitzel, mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, and a Dijon sauce. It turns out really good, and I make a mental note to add that to the rotation. After dinner, M. cleans up the kitchen while I give V. a bath. M. Interrupts the bath to make us come outside and look at a double rainbow, and it was worth it.

8:00 – it’s my turn to put V. to bed, so I get him ready, read him his favorite book, and tuck him in. Luckily he goes down easily, as I am not feeling great. Try to read in bed, but then I get violently ill (sorry). Stagger downstairs to see if M. is feeling bad, but he’s not, and we shared all the same food today. Remember that I made V. a piece of fish in the air fryer, and then used it to roast the carrots. I am allergic to fish and shellfish and should have been more careful. Skip my bedtime routine and get into bed, and fall asleep doing a guided meditation on the Peloton app.

Daily total: $185.13

Day Two:
6:10 – Alarm goes off. Ugh, it’s Monday. Hit snooze twice and get up at 6:30. It’s my turn to get V. ready for daycare. Since April, I have been working from home on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and going into the office on Tuesday and Thursday. M. drives him in on the days I work from home.

7:00 – After a quick shower, I let my hair air dry while I respond to work emails and eat two pieces of toast. I don’t bother with makeup on work from home days and instead just moisturize with Clinique Dramatically Different Gel. Once everything in my inbox is taken care of, I move on to my Monday tasks. I do accounting for a medium-sized ENT office where I have worked my entire adult life. I’m sure I could make more money elsewhere, but I am content at my job. I do not want to have any direct reports, nor do I want to work more than 40 hours or think of work outside of work. Plus, the benefits are generous, my boss is hands-off, and there is a lot of comfort in knowing what is expected of you. I have no plans to leave.

10:15 – I take a break and vacuum up a spider web that’s been bothering me for a few days and grab a Fage yogurt from the fridge. Respond to some annoying emails that have nothing to do with my job, but no one seems to know who else to ask.

12:00 – get hungry for lunch and forage in the fridge. Cobble together a (surprisingly good) lunch of fresh green beans from the neighbor’s garden and an English muffin pizza with mozzarella, kalamata olives, pepperoni, and marinara sauce. Make a grocery list for later as we are out of milk and most of the fresh produce is starting to wilt. I eat at my desk and work until 4:00. V.’s daycare is next to my office in the suburbs, which is convenient on the days I go in, but not so much when I work from home. I looked for something closer but we really like his teachers and it costs half as much as anywhere in our neighborhood.

5:30 – home from getting V. and starting on dinner. I’m making an easy meal to use up leftover produce which M. affectionately calls Food Pile, and is basically the contents of the fridge over rice or noodles. Today it’s broccoli, green beans, garlic, an onion, and some Italian sausage over noodles. It’s good and I have leftovers for lunch. M. cleans up while I play with V.

7:00 – it’s gorgeous out so we take a family walk to the grocery store. I buy apples, avocados, grapes, turkey, cheese, bread, tortillas, yogurt, milk, seltzer, cereal, a piece of salmon for M., hot dogs, some prepared foods, and some snacks V. likes. We also each get a cookie from the cookie bar. The total is $110, which is crazy. We stop at the playground on the walk home and catch a beautiful sunset. It’s M.’s turn to put V. to bed, so I read for a bit (I’m reading Orange is the New Black, about 10 years too late. I read a different prison memoir last week and it referenced OITB a few times so I thought it was about time I read it).

10:00 – ready for bed and lights out. My “beauty routine” consists of washing my face with CeraVe and taking a multivitamin. The pandemic has made me extremely low-maintenance. Fall asleep while listening to a guided meditation on the Peloton app.

Daily total: $110

Day Three

6:30 – Roll out of bed and decide that I’m too tired to go into the office today. Pregnancy is exhausting this time, which I’m sure has to do with the fact that I’m almost 42. I don’t remember feeling this way when I was pregnant with V. Eat an English muffin and drive V. to daycare.

8:30 – traffic is horrible today due to an accident on the interstate, so it takes me way longer than normal to do drop off. I am finally at my desk with some coffee. I recently discovered a huge error in our books and I’m eager to fix it, but my boss needs to review it first. He is on parental leave for the month and tells me he won’t be able to look at it until this afternoon. Fair enough, but I was hoping to tackle it immediately as it’s almost the end of our fiscal year. I work on some other, less-exciting tasks. I get a notification that I was charged for this week’s meal kit delivery ($70, in monthly expenses).

11:00 – my boss gives me the go ahead to make the corrections. Before I get started, I grab a yogurt and a seltzer from the fridge and take my 15 minute break. I’m hourly, so I get two paid 15 minute breaks, and literally no one has ever checked or counted my minutes, but I take them religiously because I’m a rule follower. I use the time to get a zucchini bread in the oven and thank myself for shredding three big zucchinis into freezable zucchini bread-sized portions last week.

12:30 – I heat up my leftover pasta and eat at my desk. I’m obsessed with looking at houses on Zillow, and a big, beautiful house in our neighborhood just dropped, so I send it to M. I keep plugging along on the project from this morning – over 3000 data records need to be changed and I’ve done 250 so far. The mail comes and I get a bill for $663.46 for the ultrasound I had last month. I will pay for this out of our medical FSA, but shouldn’t routine prenatal care be free? ($663.46, paid with FSA funds).

2:30 – My work computer is having connectivity issues so this is a good time to take my second break. Registration for the next session of swim lessons for V. goes live today and I take care of that ($65 for 8 weeks). I eat a slice of my zucchini bread as a snack and it’s delicious. I finish putting away some laundry and it’s time to get back to work.

5:00 – done with work and the family is home. Our meal kit delivery was supposed to come today but didn’t come in time for dinner, so instead of cooking we just heat up random things in the fridge. V. has half an avocado with a turkey hot dog and grapes, I have an Indian meal I bought on the grocery trip yesterday, and M. has two empanadas from the grocery trip along with some potato puffs we bought for the kid but didn’t like. After dinner we take a long family walk.

8:00 – I put V. to bed, get myself ready for bed, and read until I get sleepy. Lights out at 10:00.

Daily total: $65

Day Four

6:00 – Wednesday is my early wakeup day. Early in the pandemic, I was scared to put V. in daycare so I worked full time with him home until he was about 13 months. I keep him home on Wednesdays so that we have a day together. I work a split shift – usually 6:00-9:00, then break to play/eat lunch/put V. down for nap and then log back in from 1:00-4:00. I make up the rest of the hours during the week. Right now someone from IT is on my computer checking out my connectivity issues. He thinks he figures out the problem, yay! I do some stuff to prepare for month-end closing and have my weekly check-in with my boss. I also eat a yogurt and a piece of zucchini bread.

9:00 – done with work for the morning. My friend K. and her son are meeting me at a nearby park. It’s probably the last high 80’s day of the year, so M. sets up the kiddie pool and the slide to play in later. After an hour at the park, we make an impromptu trip to the beach. I always have a blanket and sand toys in my car, and K. had an extra swim diaper. Home at 11:00 to make a lunch of grilled turkey and cheese sandwiches, chips for M., and honeycrisp apples for me and V.

12:00 – M.’s afternoon meeting is cancelled, so I go back to work early while he plays with V. He’ll nap from 1-3 while I finish up work. I get a notification about an Amazon charge – M. ordered some wooden trains for V. ($24)

3:00 – Time for V. to get up and I log off for the day. M.’s friend comes over to hang out and we all sit in the back yard. Our kids play with the water toys and throw water balloons at us while we chat.

5:30 – I’m in no mood to cook, so we order from a nearby Italian restaurant and walk to pick it up. ($48) I look terrible (no time to shower on Wednesdays, and I was outdoors since 9 am) so of course I run into a bunch of people I know. After we eat, M. gives V. a bath while I take out the garbage and start the dishwasher. After his bath, V. helps me pick up all the water balloon detritus, and we lay down in the yard and marvel at all the dragonflies flying above us. V. thinks they look like tiny helicopters, and I think they are magical.

8:00 – It’s M’.s turn for bedtime, so I finish my book outside. I am really going to miss summer, hot nights are my favorite. I notice my skin is looking a little dull so I do an AHA peel from The Ordinary. I do my bedtime routine and get in bed at 10 pm with a guided meditation.

Daily Total: $72

Day 5

6:30 – Awake and getting ready to go into the office. The morning is going poorly because V. doesn’t like the outfit M. picked out and is crying (it isn’t “soft enough”). I totally get it, kid. The only clean soft shorts are pajama shorts, but they are plain gray and I don’t care. I get myself dressed in a fitted green midi dress, tan flat sandals, and put on a little makeup. We are on the road by 7:15.

7:45 – get to my desk and log in. Make coffee at work since our office has a great coffee maker that grinds the beans and brews a fresh cup to your liking. I get a 12 oz French roast. I manage to spill it all over myself carrying it back to my desk, which burns my arm and stains my dress. It is only 8:02 at this point and already a very long day. It is the first of the month so I have a ton of work to do. I eat a yogurt.

10:15 – it’s freezing in my office so I take my break outside. I don’t know who decided the optimal temperature for air conditioning is 68 but I hate it. It’s cold here nine months out of the year, why do we need to make it artificially cold the remaining three? I eat a piece of zucchini bread and do Wordle, which was a total B.S. word and took me all six tries and I’m so mad. I get a notification from my bank that they deposited $0.14 as my Annual Percentage Yield Earned. Wowee, I will try not to spend it all at once. My boss checks in to see how things are going today and they are going well, I am on target for month-end close.

12:00 – heat up my lunch which is the rest of the leftover pasta and a honeycrisp apple, and eat at my desk. After working for a few more hours, I start to feel tired and squished from sitting and take a couple laps around the building. Finish up my to-do list for the day and go back to the project from day 3. It’s a total slog, but I am making progress.

4:30 – leave work and get V. next door. M. is going disc golfing tonight. My neighbors have a long-standing Thursday tradition of inviting the neighborhood over for beer and pizza, so V. and I go for an hour. He’s always the only kid there, but he’s a precocious talker and adults tend to find him delightful. I have a few slices of pizza and a seltzer while V. tries to find the neighbor’s cats. He’s not interested in the food here so we head home and I make him a pile of finger foods – turkey deli meat, cheese, avocado, grapes, and a pickle. After he eats, we walk to the library to return a book and pick up my holds, but it closed at 6.

8:00 – M. gets home and graciously offers to put V. to bed since I have been alone with him all night. It’s really warm tonight so I sit on the back porch and do my nails and read a magazine. Put in a load of laundry so V. has soft shorts for tomorrow. Bedtime routine done and in bed by 10:00.

Daily total: $0

Day 6

6:30 – Up after hitting snooze twice. I get V. ready for daycare and log right into work at 7:00 still wearing the leggings and tank top I wore to bed. I have a lot of things to do this morning and I will shower during my break. Run a whole bunch of month end reports and look at our numbers for the month.

9:15 – remember I signed up for yoga, but there is no way I can get dressed and make it on time. I used to go a few times a week but I’ve been too tired lately. My yearly membership ends in December and I will probably not renew and instead just pay the drop-in fee when I want to go. M. comes home with treats from the bakery ($50.75). He got a cake for tonight and some pastries to eat for breakfast. It’s not my birthday for another two weeks, but we are celebrating tonight since some friends are coming from out of town. I see people walking past my house with yoga mats and feel sad, vow to go next Friday.

12:00 – I get tired of looking at sales tax and heat up the rest of the prepared Indian meal from the other day, and eat at my desk. Since I haven’t taken my 15 minute break yet, I walk to the library which is only a couple blocks away. I am embarrassed to be out in my PJ’s and hope I don’t see anyone. I pick up my holds (I’m Glad My Mom Died by Jenette McCurdy and Rough Draft by Katy Tur). I love memoirs and I rarely read fiction.

4:00 – done with work for the week. I do a 20 minute Peloton ride, take a quick shower, and leave to get V. from daycare. We are meeting a group of friends tonight at an outdoor beer garden. It never ceases to amaze me how many Milwaukeeans just casually own dirndls and lederhosen. My dirndl isn’t fitting at the moment, so I settle on jeans, a white flowy tank, and a floral crown. The beer garden is super fun and we have 8 adults and 3 kids in our group. I get a giant pretzel for the table and a root beer for myself ($14) and M. gets a beer in a souvenir stein ($31) and later a refill ($16). V. and I split a chicken dinner ($17.55) and M. shares a currywurst plate with a friend (she pays).

9:00 – it is way past V.’s bedtime and we finally leave. It’s my turn for bedtime but he is all wound up and ends up not falling asleep until 10:00. I do my bedtime routine and go right to sleep.

Daily total: $129.30

Day 7

7:30 – wake up still tired. M. gets V. out of bed, and they bring me coffee and an English muffin in bed. I am a lucky lady. We have no plans today and it’s pretty cool and cloudy outside.

9:00 – head to yoga. I signed up for a slow flow class but I’m still pretty exhausted at the end. Afterwards I run next door to a coffee shop to buy a bag of coffee. I have enough points earned that it is free. Get home around 10:30 and start my un-fun weekend chore: finding a home for everything that’s in our guest bedroom so we can turn it into V.’s room. I fill a rack of clothes to sell at an upcoming consignment sale, pack up a big bag of clothes that no longer fit V. to give to a friend, and three bags for goodwill. Drop off at goodwill, stop in and buy a cute pair of pajamas for V. with a llama print. ($3). We have a lunch of grilled turkey and cheese sandwiches, grapes, and green beans. M. puts him down for a nap while I clean up.  

3:30 – V. is up from his nap and I want to go to the grocery store and get treats. We are also out of some necessities. Buy an assortment of fruit, a bag of shredded cheese, seltzer, yogurt, milk, ice cream, deli meat, pretzels, and we all get a treat from the bakery. Eat half of mine on the way home ($57)

5:30 – M. and I start on dinner while V. plays with his trains in the living room. We have one of our meal kit dinners which is steak sandwiches and roasted potatoes. M. fires up the grill because cooking a steak in a pan sounds sad. V. refuses to even try this dinner and only eats strawberries.

7:30 – I’m tired, it’s been a long week, and I am done with any kind of activity. Decide to watch a movie because it’s a holiday weekend and V. probably isn’t watching more TV than any other kid this weekend. He actually cuddles on my lap the whole time, which is a miracle. M. puts him to bed at 9:00 while I check out my Old Navy order which came today. The leggings are fine, but pretty thin and I would be mad if I had spent more on them. The underwear and the dress are keepers. Bedtime routine, read in bed, and asleep at 10:30.

Daily total: $60

1i0lvy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1i0lvy8/i_found_my_dog_waiting_outside_the_problem_is_my/,"I found my dog waiting outside. The problem is, my dog was already inside.","I’ve always been a dog person. There’s something about the way they’re just there for you, no judgment, no strings attached, that makes everything a little easier to handle. After my divorce, when I moved into this house by myself, getting Max was the first thing I did. He’s a mutt, mostly shepherd, maybe some retriever in there, and he’s been my rock ever since.

It’s just the two of us out here. The house is in a pretty quiet area, not completely remote, but far enough from the city that the nights feel... still. Peaceful, usually. There’s a small yard out back with a fence, and I’ve got cameras set up on the front and back doors, just for peace of mind, you know? I’ve heard stories about coyotes in the area, and while Max is a solid 70 pounds of muscle and fur, I don’t take chances.

We’ve got our routine down. Early morning walks before I start work, evenings watching TV while Max dozes at my feet, and late nights locking up the house and double-checking the doors before heading to bed. He’s the kind of dog who sticks close to your side, always alert but never anxious. Loyal as hell.

This house never felt lonely with him in it. Honestly, I’d even say it’s been kind of comforting. There’s something grounding about having a routine, a companion who’s always there, and a quiet space to call your own.

But looking back, I realize that quietness? It wasn’t just peaceful. It was something else.

It happened on a Tuesday night, and I remember that because it was one of those nights where nothing feels unusual. I was sitting on the couch, half-watching some mindless sitcom, and Max was sprawled out by my feet, snoring softly. It was the kind of normal, uneventful evening that I’d come to rely on.

Then I heard it- a faint scratching sound coming from the back door.

At first, I barely noticed it. I figured it was the wind or maybe some branches brushing against the house. I’ve heard stuff like that before; it’s not exactly uncommon when you live in a place like this. But then it came again, louder this time.

Scratch. Scratch.

I muted the TV and tilted my head, listening. Max didn’t react, which should’ve been my first clue that something was off. Usually, he’s quick to bark at anything near the house, but he was completely out, snoring like nothing was happening.

Still, the sound was hard to ignore now. Scratch, scratch, followed by what sounded like... whimpering.

I told myself it was probably a stray dog. We’ve had a few wander through the neighborhood before, and the fence usually keeps them out. But something about it made my stomach twist.

Finally, I got up to check. I peeked through the blinds, and that’s when I saw him.

Max.

He was standing outside, pawing at the door, his ears pinned back and his tail wagging nervously like he was desperate to come in.

My first thought was that I must’ve left the door open earlier and somehow he got out. But that didn’t make sense. The door was locked, I knew it was locked. And besides, Max wasn’t supposed to be outside.

Because Max was still inside.

I turned back toward the living room, and there he was, lying on the rug exactly where I’d left him. He wasn’t asleep anymore, though. He’d lifted his head and was looking right at me, his ears twitching at the sound of the scratching.

I froze. My mind was racing, trying to process what I was seeing. I looked back at the door. The Max outside was still there, pawing and whining softly, his eyes wide and pleading. And the Max inside was staring at me, tilting his head like he was confused by my reaction.

It didn’t make sense. None of it made sense.

My first instinct was to open the door, to let the outside Max in and figure it out later. But as I reached for the lock, something stopped me.

The way he moved- it was subtle, but it was wrong. His pawing was too mechanical, like he was imitating the motion rather than doing it naturally. And the whimpering? It sounded... off. Too even, like someone had recorded a dog whining and was playing it back on a loop.

My chest tightened as I stepped back, my hand hovering over the lock. I didn’t let him in. Instead, I locked the deadbolt and pulled the blinds shut, trying to shake the feeling crawling up my spine.

I told myself it was a stray. That it just looked like Max, even though I couldn’t explain how it was such a perfect copy.

Max, the one inside, got up and padded over to me, nuzzling my hand like he always did when I was upset. I knelt down and hugged him, burying my face in his fur, telling myself it was fine. It had to be fine.

But that scratching didn’t stop. And neither did the whimpering.

It started at the back door, just like before. Scratch, scratch. Then it moved to the windows, first in the kitchen, then the living room. Each time I thought it was over, I’d hear it again, faint but deliberate.

I checked the cameras, hoping for some kind of explanation. Nothing. No movement, no sign of the dog, or anything, near the house. It was like the sound wasn’t even real, but I knew what I was hearing. I wasn’t imagining it.

Max, the one inside, wasn’t acting like himself either. He stood by the back door, his ears pinned back, his body stiff. His growl was low and quiet, almost like he didn’t want to make too much noise. I’ve never seen him like that before, not even when he heard coyotes in the distance.

At one point, I tried to get him to follow me to the kitchen to check things out, but he wouldn’t budge. He just stood there, rooted to the spot, his eyes locked on something I couldn’t see.

“Come on, Max,” I whispered, my voice trembling. But he didn’t move.

His fur was standing on end, his tail tucked so far between his legs it looked like it wasn’t there. Whatever he was sensing, it was enough to completely spook him.

By now, I was starting to notice things about the outside dog, subtle things, but enough to make my skin crawl. Its movements weren’t quite right. Too stiff, too calculated. The way it scratched at the door wasn’t frantic like you’d expect from a dog that wanted to come inside. It was... methodical. And the whimpering? I couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t real.

I tried to ignore it. I locked all the doors, shut the blinds, and left the lights on. But ignoring it didn’t help.

\-

A couple of nights later, I woke up to find Max sitting in the hallway, staring at the front door.

He wasn’t barking or growling. He wasn’t even moving. He was just sitting there, stiff as a statue, staring at the door like it might open at any second.

“Max?” I whispered, but he didn’t even turn his head. His ears twitched, but that was it.

I wanted to tell myself he was just being protective. Maybe he’d heard something, and this was his way of keeping an eye on things. But deep down, I didn’t believe that.

There was something about the way he sat there, so tense, so quiet, that made my chest tighten. Like he was waiting for something to come inside.

I thought about checking the door, just to prove to myself that nothing was there. But every time I got close, my legs felt like lead. I couldn’t bring myself to look through the peephole or pull back the blinds. I didn’t want to see what was waiting.

I kept telling myself I was overreacting, that it was all in my head. But every time I looked at Max, his stiff body, his wide, unblinking eyes, I knew I wasn’t imagining it.

Something was out there. And whatever it was, it wasn’t leaving.

That’s when things went from unsettling to completely impossible.

The scratching hadn’t stopped, but now it wasn’t just the back door or the windows. It was everywhere. I’d hear it on the front porch, on the fenced-in patio where nothing should’ve been able to get in, and once... at my bedroom window.

Let me say that again: my bedroom window. On the second floor.

I don’t know how it got up there. I don’t even want to think about how it got up there. But when I pulled back the curtain, there it was. That same dog, the one that looked just like Max, staring in at me with those wide, pleading eyes.

I slammed the curtain shut and didn’t sleep that night.

But the worst came a few nights later. I was sitting in the living room, trying to drown out the scratching with the TV turned up louder than usual. Max, inside Max, was curled up under the coffee table, trembling. I’ve never seen him like that before. His whole body was shaking, his ears pinned back, and no matter how much I called for him, he wouldn’t come out.

Then I heard it.

At first, I thought it was just the wind. But the longer I listened, the clearer it got. It was a voice.

It wasn’t loud, just faint enough that I couldn’t quite make out the words at first. But as it grew louder, my stomach dropped. It wasn’t speaking to me.

It was calling Max’s name.

“Max...”

The way it said his name made my skin crawl. It wasn’t like a normal person calling for a dog. The tone was off, stretched out, like it was trying too hard to sound human.

“Max... come here, Max...”

I froze. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to grab Max and hide in my room, but when I looked at him, he was still trembling under the table, refusing to move.

The voice kept calling. “Max...”

I couldn’t take it anymore. My chest felt tight, and every nerve in my body was screaming at me to stay inside, to ignore it. But I had to know. I had to see.

I went to the back door and threw it open.

There was nothing there. No dog, no voice, no sign of anything at all. Just the quiet, empty yard stretching out in the moonlight.

I turned to go back inside, my heart still pounding. But as I stepped through the doorway, the door slammed shut behind me with a force that shook the whole house.

I nearly jumped out of my skin. I spun around, trying to convince myself it was just the wind, even though there hadn’t been so much as a breeze all night.

That’s when I decided to check the cameras again. I needed proof, some kind of explanation. But what I found... I don’t even know how to describe it.

In the footage, I watched myself open the back door. There was nothing there, just me, standing alone in the doorway, looking out into the yard.

But when I replayed the clip, something changed.

In the second playback, the dog was there. The one that looked like Max. It was standing at the edge of the yard, staring directly at the camera.

Its eyes weren’t pleading anymore. They were dark, almost empty.

I played the footage a third time, hoping to catch something I’d missed. This time, the dog wasn’t at the edge of the yard anymore. It was closer.

And its eyes... its eyes were looking right at me.

I shut the laptop and locked every door and window in the house. I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t know what it wants.

But I can’t shake the feeling that it’s not just watching me.

It’s waiting.

\-

I thought I was finally starting to get a handle on it. The scratching had stopped for a couple of nights, and Max seemed to calm down a little. I even managed to sleep without the lights on for the first time in days. But that peace didn’t last.

It was late, around 2AM, when I heard it again.

At first, I thought it was coming from the back door, the same faint scratching and whimpering I’d been hearing for weeks. I sat up in bed, trying to shake off the grogginess, but something was different this time.

The sound wasn’t coming from outside.

It was inside the house.

The whimpering echoed faintly, like it was moving through the walls, growing louder and closer with each second. My heart started racing as I reached for the lamp, fumbling to turn it on.

“Max?” I called out, my voice shaking.

There was no response.

I swung my legs over the side of the bed and grabbed the flashlight I’d started keeping on my nightstand. When I looked toward Max’s bed, I froze.

It was empty.

His collar was lying on the floor, right in the middle of the bed where he should’ve been.

The whimpering grew louder, almost frantic now, like it was coming from multiple places at once. Then, cutting through it, I heard something else.

A voice.

Not faint or distant like before, but clear and deliberate. And this time, it wasn’t calling for Max.

It was calling for me.

“H... hello?” I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper.

The voice called my name again, dragging it out, each syllable dripping with something I can only describe as wrong.

I don’t know what possessed me to start searching the house, but I couldn’t just sit there. I grabbed the flashlight and crept into the hallway, my pulse pounding in my ears.

“Max?” I called again, even though I knew he wouldn’t answer.

The whimpering echoed from the kitchen, then the living room, then the stairs. It was everywhere, bouncing around like the house itself was alive.

I finally made my way to the living room, gripping the flashlight so hard my knuckles ached. That’s when I saw them.

Max.

Both of him.

They were standing side by side in the middle of the room, perfectly still, staring right at me.

At first, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I blinked, hoping one of them would disappear, but they didn’t. Two identical dogs, each one a perfect copy of the other.

“Max?” I whispered, taking a shaky step forward.

Neither of them moved.

I shined the flashlight on them, desperate to see something, anything that would tell me which one was real. But they were exactly the same, down to the fur on their paws and the tilt of their heads.

Then one of them growled.

It wasn’t a normal growl, though. It was low and guttural, deeper than anything a dog should be able to make. The sound rumbled through the room, vibrating in my chest.

Its eyes flickered, catching the light in a way that wasn’t natural. They didn’t glow, they shimmered, like something beneath the surface was trying to push through.

I stumbled back, my breath catching in my throat. The other Max, the real Max, I hoped, cowered, his ears flat against his head, whimpering softly.

“Stay back,” I choked out, pointing the flashlight at the growling one.

It tilted its head, the growl fading into a sound that almost, almost, sounded like a laugh.

It was low and deep, almost vibrating through the room. I felt it in my bones. The sound didn’t stop, it just kept building, growing louder and louder, like it was daring me to move.

I stepped back, trying to keep my distance. My legs felt like jelly, barely able to hold me up.

“Max,” I whispered, but I wasn’t even sure which one I was talking to.

The growling Max took a step forward, its head tilting ever so slightly, almost like it was mocking me. The other Max, my Max, let out a soft, pitiful whimper, his whole body pressing into the floor like he was trying to disappear.

I panicked.

I ran to the nearest room, the guest bedroom, and slammed the door shut, throwing my weight against it. My hands fumbled for the lock, and when I finally clicked it into place, I grabbed a chair and wedged it under the knob. It wasn’t much, but it was all I had.

Then I just sat there.

I don’t know how long I stayed in that room, clutching the chair like it was a lifeline, my breath coming in shallow gasps. Hours, maybe. The growling eventually stopped, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave. Every time I thought about opening the door, I imagined what might be waiting on the other side.

Eventually, exhaustion took over, and I must’ve dozed off. When I woke up, it was morning.

The house was quiet.

I waited a while longer, listening for any sound, any sign of movement. When I finally worked up the courage to open the door, my legs felt like lead.

The living room was empty.

Max, both of them, was gone.

At first, I tried to convince myself it was a nightmare, some kind of stress-induced hallucination. But the evidence was there: claw marks gouged into the walls and the furniture, deep enough to leave splinters on the floor.

I didn’t know what to think. Part of me wanted to burn the house down and never look back, but I couldn’t bring myself to leave. It was my home. Max had been my home, and now he was gone.

For a few days, I tried to act like things were normal, like I could just move on. But the house was too quiet, too empty. The silence weighed on me in a way it hadn’t before.

So, I did what any dog person would do, I adopted another dog.

I couldn't live without the companionship. Especially after what happened. Being alone was not an option for me.

Her name’s Bella, a sweet little lab mix who wouldn’t hurt a fly. She’s been with me for a few weeks now, and for the most part, things have been fine. She sleeps in Max’s old bed, and I like to think he’d have liked her.

But last night, something happened.

I was sitting on the couch, Bella curled up at my feet, when I heard it.

A faint scratching sound.

It was coming from the back door.

I froze, my whole body going cold. Bella’s ears perked up, and she let out a low, confused whine, staring at the door like she was waiting for something.

I haven’t checked yet. I don’t think I can.

But I know one thing for sure: whatever it is, it’s not done with me.",1,1736795561.0,CreepsMcPasta,0,1.0,False

1. TPAB - KDOT
this album is pretty much self explanatory lol 


2. Abbey Road - Beatles

3. Melt My Eyez - Denzel
for me personally, the best denzel curry album. his strongwsy production, rapping, and themes. had this album on repeat basically since it came out, and for good reason imo.


4. Mellon Collie - Smashing Pumpkins
a lot of people hate on this album saying it's bloated, but honestly I enjoy every song in this album alot. it's an epic, 2 hour long, perfect ballad of an album that I adore. personally my favorite smashing pumpkins album, and one of my favorite alternative albums PERIOD.


5. Olé Coltrane - John Coltrane
definitely the best john coltrane album. that opening track is absolutely incredible. the way it builds for 18 whole minutes, and still feels like it goes by quick is amazing. then the 3 tracks after that feel like a nice wind down from the chaos of the first track, while still keeping the same feel and vibe.


6. good kid, m.a.a.d. city - KDOT
this used to be my favorite kdot album, until TPAB grew on me. still a perfect album tho.

the best Radiohead album. one of the best alternative rock albums of all time. self-explanatory.


8. Imaginal Disk - Magdalena Bay
literally perfect in every way. not only one of my favorite indie pop albums, but also one of the best pop albums period. the concept, the production, the mixing, the singing, the lyrics, the music videos and cover, everything is perfect.


9. Forgotten Arcade - Frizk
just listen to it. honestly one of the funnest albums of all time, with some very creative and satisfying production.


10. Master Of Puppets - Metallica
THE BEST metal album of all time. straight was the album that got me into the genre. amazing concept, amazing guitar playing, drum playing, bass playing, lyrics, basically everything LOLL.


11. What's Going On - Marvin Gaye
marvin gaye has literally one of the best voices of all time. combine that, with very innocent lyrics still talking about very important topics, such as religion, hate, and classism. as well as some of the most amazing soul production ever.
12. Playboi Carti - Playboi Carti
my favorite carti album, extremely consistent with a special place in my heart.


13. BLUE LIPS - ScHoolboy Q
probably some of the best production, pace, and flows of all time. the lyrics are amazing too, obv, but those things overshadow it for me. in a good way.


14. Illmatic - Nas
the best hiphop of the 90s, by far. great production, that has the ability to feel very spacious despite the fact that it's mostly mono. and of course, some amazing rap performances from nas himself.


15. Black Saint - Charles Mingus
self explanatory lol. one of the best jazz albums of all time.


16. More Life - Drake
my personal fav drake album. best production, best rapping, most versatile, and just overall very consistent and great to put on while driving late at night.

CLUB CLASSIC. CULT CLASSIC. BRAT SUMMER !! in all seriousness, this album is just terrific. the contrast and ratio between bangers and personally introspective songs is great.


18. Songs in the Key of Life - Stevie Wonder
the best production and instrumentation on any album ever. as well as great lyrical concepts and executions. self explanatory tho.


19. CALL ME IF U GET LOST - Tyler creator
the best tyler album, his best rapping, production, just straight bangers.


20. The College Dropout - Kanye
this album has a special place in my heart because of ""We Don't Care"", ""Spaceship"", ""Slow Jamz"", and ""All Falls Down"". amazing  lyricism, production, and really easy to make morning coffee to.",11,1736795486.0,spotify,15,1.0,False

This is like if we follow very strictly. 

But some of us might not be able to. Some of us might take a good amount of fat, but end up having a cup of coffee with sugar. Or a bread slice, or a little rice etc. 

Then does this diet becomes dangerous for such people ?
Since now the body might not be fat adapted, then the fat we eat now won't be burnt and just stored ?


Basically my question is if someone is doing 60%-70% carnivore, will it be beneficial for him/her ?
Or it will be dangerous and then that individual should just not do carnivore if that person is not all in!

Is carnivore a spectrum kind of a diet with different benefits or is it like a binary, if you do it correctly you win if you don't then it will be like super dangerous ?",1,1736795423.0,carnivorediet,3,0.67,False

Title: ""The Jet-Black Wings vs. The Dark Reunion: Saiki’s Most Unexpected Battle""


---

Prologue: The Calm Before the Chaos

It was just another average morning at PK Academy. The sun hung lazily in the sky, casting a warm glow over the classroom windows. The students were going through the motions, scribbling notes and yawning, while Saiki Kusuo sat at his desk, staring out the window. He was holding a cup of coffee jelly in one hand and a textbook in the other, barely able to keep his attention on the lesson.

Another normal day, Saiki thought to himself, with nothing special happening… as usual.

Across the room, Kaidou Shun was busy having an intense conversation with himself. He was pacing back and forth, muttering under his breath, completely oblivious to the class around him.

""I can feel it. I can feel the ominous presence growing,"" Kaidou said, his voice rising with every word. ""The Dark Reunion is approaching, and we must be ready!""

""Here we go again,"" Saiki thought, his eyes flicking to Kaidou. He didn’t even need to use his powers to know what Kaidou was up to. It was always the same thing—Kaidou would start making grandiose claims about some hidden organization or evil group, and the class would either ignore him or roll their eyes.

But this time, something was different. As Kaidou continued to rant, the temperature in the room seemed to drop. The lights flickered. There was a strange, almost imperceptible hum in the air. Saiki's eyes narrowed.

Wait… something’s off. This isn’t just Kaidou’s usual nonsense. Something’s really happening.


---

Chapter 1: The Unseen Threat

The lunch bell rang, signaling the end of the morning lessons. Kaidou, looking even more frantic than before, gathered his friends under the large oak tree in the schoolyard.

""Listen to me!"" Kaidou said, his hands trembling. ""The Dark Reunion is real, and they are planning something terrible. I’ve been tracking them for weeks!""

""Are you sure you're not just imagining things?"" Kuboyasu asked, giving Kaidou a doubtful look.

""No! This is not a joke! They’ve been influencing the world from the shadows!"" Kaidou shouted, his voice growing more desperate. ""I can feel their power drawing closer with every passing moment!""

""Uh-huh,"" Nendou muttered, half-listening while snacking on a rice ball. ""Sure, Kaidou. I’m sure you’ve been 'tracking' them.""

""Yeah, this sounds a lot like the stuff you usually make up,"" Aiura added, rolling her eyes. ""Why don’t you focus on your grades instead of your imaginary enemies?""

But Kaidou wasn’t deterred. His eyes glowed with an intense fire. ""I swear, the Dark Reunion is real, and we need to prepare! We’re going to need all our strength to fight them!""

Saiki, who had been listening with half interest, suddenly felt a strange energy surge in the air. The temperature around them dropped further, and the sky above began to darken. His eyes widened in realization.

This isn’t a joke. Something’s about to happen… and it’s going to be big.

Without warning, a massive rift tore open in the sky above the school. A blinding flash of light followed by a deep, resounding crack shook the ground beneath them. The students screamed in shock as a wave of dark energy washed over the area.

From the rift emerged a group of figures cloaked in black, their faces obscured by shadow. At the forefront of the group was a figure who stood tall, his presence exuding power. His hair was a familiar shade of pink, and his eyes gleamed with an unnatural intensity.

The students were paralyzed with fear, unable to move. The figure stepped forward, his voice deep and commanding.

""Greetings, mortals. I am the leader of the Dark Reunion, and I have come to claim what is mine.""


---

Chapter 2: The Unexpected Arrival

Kaidou, still in disbelief, stood frozen in place. ""This… this is impossible!""

""Is that… Saiki?"" Hairo whispered, staring at the figure. ""No way. It looks just like him, but something’s… off.""

Saiki squinted. ""No, that’s not me. That’s another version of me. A much darker version.""

The figure smirked, his eyes locking with Saiki’s. ""You must be the real Saiki Kusuo. It’s amusing to see how weak you are compared to me. I’ve unlocked my true potential, and now… the world will bow before me.""

The air around them grew heavy as the figure raised his hand, releasing a burst of dark energy that sent a shockwave through the schoolyard. Saiki barely managed to raise a barrier around the group, protecting them from the blast.

""Saiki, you have to stop him!"" Kaidou yelled, his eyes wide with a mix of fear and awe. ""You’re the only one who can do it!""

Saiki's expression remained neutral, but his mind was racing. This is bad. I wasn’t expecting this.

Kaidou’s voice broke through his thoughts. ""I knew it! I knew the Dark Reunion was real! But this… this is beyond anything I imagined!""

The dark Saiki chuckled. ""You’re right to be surprised, Kaidou. The Dark Reunion is a force beyond your comprehension. And now that I’ve arrived, nothing can stop me.""

Kaidou clenched his fists. ""I won’t let you do this!""


---

Chapter 3: The Unleashing of Power

The battle began almost immediately. Evil Saiki, using his unrestrained psychic powers, launched a barrage of energy blasts toward Saiki and his friends. The students scrambled to defend themselves, but their attacks were futile.

Kaidou, feeling an overwhelming sense of urgency, tried to summon his hidden powers. ""I… I can do this!""

He ripped off the bandages wrapped around his wrists, releasing a wave of pure energy. The force of the explosion sent the Dark Reunion members reeling.

Saiki watched in surprise. I didn’t think Kaidou had this much power in him…

The energy radiating from Kaidou was immense. It was as if the power of a storm had been contained within his body, ready to be unleashed at a moment’s notice. His face was filled with determination, but there was also a hint of confusion.

This is… too much for me to control.

Kaidou’s power surged out of control, but instead of collapsing, he embraced it. ""I will fight with everything I have!""

The Dark Reunion leader sneered. ""Fool. You cannot defeat me.""

Saiki, sensing the overwhelming pressure, realized that he would have to push himself even further. He closed his eyes for a moment, focusing on unlocking his true potential. As he did, he felt a sudden surge of power flooding through him—something that had been dormant within him for years.

The power was different from what he had ever felt before. It wasn’t just his usual psychic abilities; it was something deeper, more primal. It was as if the entire universe was at his command.

""Let’s finish this,"" Saiki muttered, his voice calm but filled with an unyielding force.


---

Chapter 4: The Battle Intensifies

The battle between Saiki and his dark counterpart escalated. The sky above seemed to crack open with each powerful blow exchanged between the two. Kaidou, still struggling to control his powers, managed to create a barrier that protected the others.

""Everyone, stay back!"" Kaidou shouted, sweat dripping from his brow. ""I’ll hold them off!""

Nendou, standing off to the side, stared in awe at the sheer magnitude of the battle. ""This is insane! I can’t believe this is really happening!""

Saiki and Evil Saiki were now locked in a fierce struggle, each trying to outmatch the other. The air crackled with energy as they clashed, sending shockwaves across the battlefield.

Kaidou, feeling the pressure, looked to Saiki for guidance. ""What do we do now?""

Saiki, never one to let emotions cloud his judgment, glanced at Kaidou. ""Stay focused. We can’t defeat them alone. We need to work together.""

Kaidou nodded, his face set with determination. ""Right. Let’s do this!""


---

Chapter 5: The Final Strike

With a sudden burst of power, Kaidou unleashed his full potential. The energy that had been building up within him exploded outward, creating a shockwave that engulfed the entire area. The Dark Reunion leader faltered for a moment, caught off guard by Kaidou’s newfound strength.

Seizing the opportunity, Saiki used his powers to teleport behind Evil Saiki, landing a decisive blow that sent him crashing to the ground.

The battle was over.

The Dark Reunion leader, defeated, looked up at Saiki with a mixture of rage and disbelief. ""How… how could you…?""

Saiki’s expression was calm as ever. ""You were never a match for me.""


---

Epilogue: The Aftermath

The rift in the sky closed, and the dark energy dissipated. The schoolyard was quiet once more, save for the sounds of students recovering from the chaos. Kaidou, his energy now spent, collapsed to the ground, panting heavily.

""I did it…"" he whispered, his voice filled with disbelief. ""I actually fought alongside Saiki and defeated the Dark Reunion…""

Saiki glanced at him, his expression unreadable. Maybe Kaidou’s not so useless after all.

The group slowly began to gather around, each of them reflecting on the events that had just unfolded. It had been a day none of them would ever forget.

But even as they stood there, Saiki knew one thing for certain: no matter how many battles they faced, he would always be the one forced to deal with the aftermath.

ive always gotten this feeling of magic in the air during nighttime. when I was younger, around 4 or 5, I remember picturing this magic literally. there was gold dust floating everywhere in my parents room while I was trying to go to sleep. one time, I had gone outside to see what my parents were doing and the gold dust, the stars, and the moon all together were breathtakingly gorgeous. I remember feeling like they were singing me a song. ( I wasn't a very imaginative child so that should say a lot about how much I adore the night)


 but in more ways than one, everything turns dark. all of my deepest traumas, impulsive thoughts, fears, and past uncomfortable experiences take full control over me. movies, songs, books, and tv shows are no longer enough to distract me from this corruption. the only thing that keeps me grounded is other people 


me and b are no longer sharing a bed, or even a room, so I can't turn to her for comfort when these bad thoughts creep in. so I just let them run wild. it got really bad last night. I thought for sure that my anxiety or some other uncontrollable event would kill me. I kept replaying my own death in my head


now that it's daytime, I can't believe that I was being so irrational. I almost find it humorous. this doesn't just effect night time me though, it also tremendously effects daytime me. im definitely not performing the way I should be in work because im so sleepy. everything that people are saying to me is going in one ear and out the other. I can barely hold small talk right now. all ive been thinking about is when I can get home and take a nap


 I drunk sugar loaded coffee earlier mostly on a whim. I never drink coffee, I was just hoping it would cure my drowsiness. but I don't feel energized, I feel uncalm (99% sure that's a word) and shaky. my 30 minute break is almost over, so I have to go back to pretending I know what im doing and getting treated horribly by both customers and employees. being mentally ill is exhausting. ✌🏻",1,1736795283.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,0.67,False

Anyone else go thru this? Any tips?

Protein shakes are too many steps to do before fully waking up/taking my meds, I have a TON of food allergies that make pre-mades difficult or prohibitively expensive.

I am considering returning the M4 mini and consolidating gaming/graphics/audio production onto the same computer, and putting the money from the mac mini to do some upgrades to my  PC. Also, I just got a Quest 3 headset and want to play PC VR games (DCS, MS FlightSim, ACC, Half Life Alyx etc). For audio production I will be using Reaper and UAD console software. For photo and graphics: Lightroom, and photoshop.

A few options I am considering (I'll be adding SSD storage regardless so I didn't include it here): - Upgrading to 32GB ram - Upgrading to a better  9th gen LGA 1151 CPU- Upgrading to a better video card (RTX 4070 Super?)

Current build: i5 9600k / RTX 2070 based:

* Intel Core i5 9th Gen - Core i5-9600K Coffee Lake 6-Core 3.7 GHz (4.6 GHz Turbo) LGA 1151 (300 Series) 95W
* ASRock Z390 Phantom Gaming 4 LGA 1151 (300 Series) Intel Z390 SATA 6Gb/s ATX Intel Motherboard
* EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC BLACK EDITION GAMING, 08G-P4-1171-KR, 8GB GDDR6, Dual HDB Fans
* GeIL EVO SPEAR 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin PC RAM DDR4 3000 (PC4 24000) Desktop Memory Model GSB416GB3000C16ADC
* 1TB Corsair Force MP300 M.2 2280 240GB PCI-Express 3.0 x2, NVME 1.3 3D TLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD)
* 1TB SATA SSD (forgot the model)
* CORSAIR TX-M Series TX550M CP-9020133-NA/RF 550 W ATX12V v2.4 / EPS 2.92 80 PLUS GOLD
* Asus Thunderboltex 3 PCIe expansion card

So my questions are:

\- Would some incremental upgrades now be worth it and where to put my money? or should I just wait to build a whole new system?

\- Better to keep the photo editing and audio production on the Mac and leave the PC for gaming?

I go to the same little cafe 4, sometimes 5 days a week to get coffee and read a book by myself. I enjoy it a lot. I'd been doing it for about 2 months by this point when I noticed a woman and her two friends, none of whom I'd never seen before, walk in. The only reason it stood out to me was since it was such a small, hole in the wall type of place, you recognize the few faces who actually come around. Expected to probably never see them again, maybe one more time, that's how it usually is with new customers. Except it wasn't that way, the one girl kept coming.

I was wondering if she's into me? Now truthfully, I'm not positive with how I feel about her, it's dependent on the day. Some days she's more nosy than others, some days she's nicer, some less.

What I have in mind is this - I'm just starting B1 course but need a practice partner. Someone with whom I can practice vocabulary and speaking. I would like to meet up once a week for coffee or something in Stuttgart and just practice what we learnt. 

I know there are online platforms and apps, but I'm looking for a more concrete commitment and accountability in learning the language irl.

My friends are fluent in German and though I appreciate their help, I feel it makes me feel more at ease when I speak with someone more at my level while working up the courage to speak in broken German to someone who is fluent.

So if you are or know someone who is also looking to learn German, do DM me. 

Thank you and I look forward in connecting with like minded people in Stuttgart.",3,1736794956.0,stuttgart,5,1.0,False

I tried nofap challenge many times failing miserably every time.

I'm a pretty anxious person, I drinked a lot of alcohol, been sober for two years now tho', so with me being sober my anxiety started to skyrocket. Alcohol was one of my ""solutions"" to anxiety.

So I started to read on how to manage it without alcohol, so meditation was the way. After some months being more present, and with more insight I discovered that coffee was in part the culprit, I drinked big cups of basically espresso coffee everyday, 2, 3, 4 big cups. So like the meme, I was in a cycle of no sleep need coffee, too much coffe can't sleep, etc ...

Now I was with less anxiety and sleeping better, but, while I sleep well at night, without coffee I feel a lack of energy everymorning. So the solution to have more energy in the morning was exercise. So I started exercising.

  
nofap

so suddenly with less anxiety, better sleep, meditating, reading, doing exercise regularly one day I realized that my fapping ""habit"" was reduced to maybe one time a week or less, I wasn't even thinking about this, it just happened so I decided to give it a try and started with nofap challenge again. And here I am, 3 months later.

benefits:

well, I guess none xD, or who knows, because in the last year or so I was fighting all my other demons, and I didn't have pied or stuff like that. The thing is that I still have a pretty dirty mind, every time I see a sexy girl outside my mind starts to imagine a lot of dirty stuff, so still no ""reset""...

I was told that the DLC burrs could work for both espresso and filter coffee, and I received the Duo with the DLC burrs mounted to the carrier plate.  
 
At first, I used the DLC burrs for espresso, but even at the zero point, the grounds were WAY too coarse. So I swapped out the DLC burrs for the stock espresso burrs, putting those burrs back on their original carrier plate.  
 
Still, my grounds have been too coarse. I assumed it could be because the zero point was wrong, so I recalibrated the zero position. Now, when I'm at the zero point, [I hear the burrs touching like this](https://youtu.be/oqtFkSPV3v0?t=49), which should be the correct procedure. Still, even at very fine grind settings (0-5), my grinds are FAR too corase, and shots run through in less than 10 seconds. The only way I'm able to get decent shots is by going past the zero point, knowing that the burrs are colliding, but even in these grind settings, dialing in the grinder has been super difficult due to erratic shot times when making minor (0.5-1 position) adjustments
 
What's even more concerning is that I took the burrs apart to inspect and clean them and used some water on a rag to wipe off the burrs and I noticed some rust on the bottom burr carrier. I'm probably colliding the burrs too often at these extreme grind settings.
 
I'm really unsure what the issue is here. Did I receive a dud grinder? Can someone please help because I'm losing my mind!",1,1736794702.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I recently decided to advance in coffee making and bought a second hand breville b+. All good with pulling out espresso, but it puzzles me when it comes to frothing:

- in automatic mode, it does produce steam all the way and the milk gets somewhat silky. Still not satisfied with the result and wanted to master manual mode anyway, so I stopped using automatic.

- in manual mode, if I press steam button without submerging the wand I can see the steam goes visually fine until I press the button once again (which is normal behavior to my view). But when I start it again shortly aferwards with the wand submerged (even slightly) in the milk, it stops steaming after 2-3 sec but the pump goes on and just spraying water through the wand. No error indication or anything so I conclude that the machine thinks it does frothing while it's not :(

I did descaling (2 times) also disassembled the machine and ensured that the tube that goes to the pressure sensor is not clogged as well as the steamer nose (have read somethere that it might help) - no luck, it got better after the 1st descale but the issue returned after few cups. 

I'm out of ideas as of today, is there anything else I can try before getting it to the service?

1i0linb,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/1i0linb/it_is_up_to_women_to_be_proactive_in_the_dating/,It is up to Women to be proactive in the dating market nowadays,"Just as a general disclaimer, I will be making some generalizations and some of the viewpoints may not be the truth, but how some things are perceived. I will do my best to call these out as I make them, but again, not all men, not all women, not all situations.

Alright, into the fire. It's no secret that women, generally speaking, hold a large chunk of, of not the majority of the power/selection in today's dating market. Dating apps show the statistics, even women on here say that for them it's about sorting through all the bad apples, rather than just getting offers in the first place. (This is NOT to say that it is any easier for women, just that women's situation is different than men's, in general).

Back in the 50's-80's the power was roughly split, with men having to ask and women having to agree for dates, and later on relationships to occur (Not saying it was better back then either, every time has it's own issues).

Now, men are told not to ask, that coming up to women in public is wrong, etc. Even if that is only relegated to online forums and media sites, and (probably) it is very prevalent across online feedback. Men also are faced with false accusations, being called a creep, there are now even several Facebook/social media groups that will share photos of men that women went on a bad date with, that warn other women in the same area to stay away, with no actual proof, just on a woman's word. I have witnessed a friend's life almost get destroyed due to a vindictive girl in high school making false accusations. I have been called a creep numerous times as a lifeguard for saving/helping women, and once by some girls in high school for coaching little league in high school for community service hours. *I don't think this is very common among women in any respect,* but the point is that men see all of this, either online or in person, and the lack of backlash from any female sector makes them feel alone, and sometimes jaded. (This is not to take away from women's issues at all, but just to make light of what men *see* when they even look at the dating market).

The bar for approaching at all is much higher/dangerous (at least in perception), with the only exceptions being dating apps, which is why so many women complain about the amount of ""freedom's choice"" sausage getting thrown at them. (Hillshire is that Grade A sausage, lol)

So, women basically get to pick and choose, yet relationships still are at an all time low. Birth rates are super low. This subreddit exists, and so on. How do we fix this? Women need to become more active in finding a suitable partner. What does that mean? Women need to join and take minor interest in male hobbies, join male spaces, take an active interest in things that would attract a ""Hillshire man"". (Yes, I will be running with that analogy, lol) Join recreational sports leagues, go to bowling alleys, sport events, fitness groups, join a male hobby ""group"" like woodworking or a DnD group or something (and all of this need to be done respectively, I might add, nobody wants another Gamergate). If you're in college, go hang out in the STEM areas (or whatever your looking for) like the university buildings or the library or something.

It's subjective, yes, and that's where the women can choose what sausage brand they want, but the point is that the women doing this are making themselves available to the type of men they want. I see women, even on here, saying they're hanging out in cafes and parks, waiting for a guy to walk up to them, when they're missing the point. If a woman is sitting at a table with your phone out and a coffee in hand, guys are not going to approach them, she looks busy. If a woman is playing with your dog in a park, again, she looks busy. I know that there is kind of a joke, like ""looking confused in a home depot"", but even then only the guys that will approach you anyway will actually come up to you. Hanging out in a coed or male dominated group setting (not female dominated) gives both women and the men they want the opportunity to talk to each other without a major initiation from the man. There isn't the hurdle of starting a conversation with a stranger in public to end up asking someone out, plus, women then get to choose where the guy comes from. It's not a guarantee every time, but it at least improves her chances at finding someone she is interested in.

I'm not a huge Mathew Hussy fan, but I have come across some of his content, and he does make a few good points when he talks about being proactive in dating and ""giving men permission to make the first move"". Two of my favorite lines from him is ""Don't be easy, but in the first 5 minutes, be easy!"" and ""If you're the 1 in 20 that makes it easy, then you're the one that he's coming up to"". It's true. If a girl smiles and waves at me while we're playing kickball in a community league, I will be much more inclined to go up and talk to her over a girl sitting on her phone in a coffee shop. (I also make my coffee at home or at my job too, so...) Starting a conversation with a guy could literally be all you need to do in terms of initiation.

Yes, women have their own problems dating. Violence, sexual violence, objectification, abuse, manipulation, etc. (Freedom's Choice sausage problems). I am not saying these are right, or less of an issue, or say that women shouldn't be concerned with these issues. This post isn't to dimmish those problems or wave them away, in fact, following this post a little might help with some of that. My opinions aren't the end all, be all either, I am not Jesus, and what I say will obviously not apply to everybody, I am simply trying to point out how a lot of women seem to be ""waiting for the right guy"" to approach them when the ""right guy"" doesn't want to approach anymore because it *might* be too hard. So, if women make it even just a little easier for Mr. Hillshire to ask them out, chances are he probably will (or, you know, whatever type of sausage you want).

TL;DR: Women have much more selection in choosing a partner, so instead of waiting for a good choice to come to them, women should be actively putting themselves in situations where they get to interact a lot with the the men they want to date.",15,1736794668.0,PurplePillDebate,86,0.8,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.

* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I froze, coffee cup halfway to my lips. Paige's crayon scratched against paper as she continued coloring, seemingly oblivious to how my hand started shaking.

""What other daddy, sweetie?""

She pointed to her drawing without looking up. Four figures stood holding hands: a small one in pink (Paige), one in blue (my husband Wade), one in red (me), and one in black, taller than the rest, with arms that stretched to the edge of the paper.

""The one who visits me when you and Daddy are sleeping,"" she said, reaching for a darker crayon. ""He told me not to wake you up because you need your rest. He's teaching me things.""

The coffee cup slipped from my grip, shattering on the kitchen floor. Paige didn't flinch.

""What... what kinds of things?"" I whispered.

""Secret things. About the people under the beds. About the hungry dark. About what happens when all the mommies and daddies go to sleep forever."" She started filling in the tall figure's face with the black crayon, pressing so hard the paper began to tear. ""He says I'm almost ready to learn the best secret.""

I grabbed her shoulders, forcing her to look at me. ""Paige, no one visits you at night. It's just me and Daddy here. No one else.""

She smiled, but something was wrong with her eyes. They seemed deeper, darker.

""That's what he said you'd say. He told me you'd be scared because you're not ready for the secrets yet."" She leaned in close, whispering. ""But don't worry, Mommy. When I learn the last secret, I can teach you. He says it only hurts for a minute.""

That night, I convinced Wade to set up a motion-activated camera in Paige's room. At breakfast, she was humming while she ate her cereal, impossibly cheerful for how little she must have slept.

With trembling fingers, I checked the footage.

3:33 AM: Paige sits up in bed, staring at her closet.
3:34 AM: She waves at nothing.
3:35 AM: She begins nodding, as if listening to someone.
3:36 AM: The camera glitches, showing static.
3:37 AM: Paige is back asleep, but her closet door is open.
3:38 AM: A long, black finger reaches into frame and turns off the camera.

Paige's drawing is still on the fridge. This morning, I noticed something different about it. The figure in black is no longer in the background.

## Enhancing Your Workspace: A Comprehensive Guide to Chair Cup Holder Attachments

When workdays stretch long, the last thing you need is an inconvenient workspace.  For home office workers, students, and anyone seeking a boost in comfort and efficiency, a chair cup holder attachment can be a game-changer.  This guide explores the best chair cup holder attachments available in 2025, helping you choose the perfect solution for your needs. We'll delve into features, benefits, and even address common concerns to ensure you find the ideal fit.

### Understanding Chair Cup Holder Attachments: More Than Just a Cup Holder

A chair cup holder attachment is a cleverly designed accessory that securely holds your beverages – from coffee mugs and water bottles to cans and even some tumblers – while you're seated.  Unlike placing your drink precariously on your desk or floor, these attachments offer a stable and convenient solution. They typically attach to various parts of your chair, including armrests, legs (depending on chair design), or even the back, providing flexibility depending on your specific chair and personal preference.  These range from simple, sturdy designs to those with added features like adjustable arms or magnetic bases for enhanced security.

### The Advantages of a Chair Cup Holder Attachment: Productivity and Peace of Mind

The benefits extend beyond simple convenience.  A well-chosen chair cup holder attachment offers several significant advantages:

**1. Enhanced Productivity and Focus:** Imagine working without the constant worry of spilling your drink or having to interrupt your flow to reach for it.  A secure cup holder frees up a hand and allows for uninterrupted concentration, boosting overall productivity.

**2. Space-Saving Design:**  Cluttered desks are often a breeding ground for distractions.  Chair cup holder attachments keep your drinks off your desk, freeing up valuable workspace and creating a more organized and efficient environment.  This is especially beneficial for those working in smaller spaces or shared offices.

**3. Durability and Reliability:**  High-quality chair cup holder attachments are built to last.  Many are constructed from durable materials like ABS plastic and reinforced silicone, ensuring they can withstand daily use and various temperatures.  Look for attachments with strong clamps and secure gripping mechanisms to prevent accidental drops.

**4. Versatility and Adaptability:**  While some attachments are designed for specific chair models, many are versatile enough to fit a variety of seating types.  Some even extend beyond office chairs, finding use in vehicles (ATVs, cars) or even strollers.  Pay close attention to the clamp design and adjustability when selecting an attachment to ensure compatibility.

**5. Cost-Effectiveness:**  While prices vary, many chair cup holder attachments offer a cost-effective solution compared to replacing your entire chair or investing in expensive desk organizers.  They represent a small investment with a significant return in terms of comfort and efficiency.


### Top Chair Cup Holder Attachments: A 2025 Review

Choosing the right attachment can feel overwhelming. To help you navigate the options, we've reviewed some of the top contenders:

**1. True Places Emmett Folding Chair Cup Holder:** Specifically designed for the True Places Emmett Folding Chair, this attachment offers a secure and convenient solution for users of this particular chair model.  Its ability to attach to multiple points on the chair adds to its versatility, accommodating various beverage sizes. User reviews praise its ease of use and secure hold.

**2. Liveffora Wheelchair Cup Holder Attachment:** This model stands out for its adaptability and focus on accessibility.  Designed for wheelchairs, it securely holds beverages, offering a significant improvement in independence and convenience for wheelchair users. The durable plastic construction and silicone grip ensure stability, while the embedded magnetic pebble allows for compatibility with certain attachment systems. User reviews highlight its functionality and ease of use.

**3. Chama Chair Attachable Cup Holder:** This versatile option is praised for its robust design and ability to accommodate a wide range of cup sizes. Constructed from durable ABS plastic and collapsible silicone, it features a leveling arm with a versatile clamp, allowing for secure attachment to various chair types, ATVs, and even strollers.  Users appreciate its strong build and adaptability.

###  Addressing Common Concerns and Questions

**What materials are best for chair cup holder attachments?**  The most common and reliable materials are high-quality plastics (like ABS) and silicone.  These materials offer a good balance of durability, flexibility, and resistance to temperature changes.

**How do I choose the right attachment for my chair?** Consider the type and size of your chair, the size of your typical beverages, and the desired level of adjustability. Look for attachments with versatile clamps and leveling arms for optimal flexibility and compatibility.  Check manufacturer specifications to ensure compatibility with your specific chair model.

**Are these attachments suitable only for office chairs?**  No, many are designed for versatility. Several models are compatible with a wide range of seating, including wheelchairs, ATVs, and strollers, demonstrating their adaptability beyond the typical office setting.


### Beyond the Basics:  Further Considerations and Resources

While the above models offer excellent options, various other chair cup holder attachments are available, catering to specific needs and preferences.  Consider factors like weight capacity, clamp strength, and adjustability when making your selection.


**Statistical Insights:**  While precise statistics on chair cup holder attachment usage are limited, anecdotal evidence and market trends suggest a growing demand for convenient workspace accessories, reflecting a broader focus on workplace ergonomics and comfort.

**Case Studies:**  Although specific case studies quantifying productivity increases directly linked to chair cup holder attachments are scarce, the general improvement in workplace comfort and reduction in interruptions strongly suggest a positive correlation with improved focus and efficiency.


### Conclusion:  Elevating Your Workspace, One Sip at a Time

Investing in a high-quality chair cup holder attachment can significantly enhance your workspace experience. By carefully considering your needs and reviewing the available options, you can find a solution that boosts productivity, improves comfort, and adds a touch of convenience to your daily routine. Whether you're a dedicated home office worker, a busy student, or anyone seeking a more comfortable and efficient workspace, a chair cup holder attachment is a small investment with a potentially significant return.

1i0la8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i0la8c/kf7_detailed_review_and_comparison_jura_e8_and_e4/,KF7: Detailed review and comparison Jura E8 and E4,"I’ve benefited a lot from all the advice in this forum. Hope this review helps someone.

KF7 compared with: Jura E4, Jura E8 (and KF8 features)

Bought with: Whirlpool Insider pass. $999 plus taxes. Free shipping.

Overall: Blown away by the coffee out of this 1k Superautomatic.

Out of the box: 

Machine feels very solid in comparison with the Juras, particularly the water container and its handle. Screen is not very bright. I chose the KF7 vs. KF8 because: (a) plant milk is not so important to me, and reports are that the KF7 handles plant milk fine anyway, (b) width of the screen is not so important to me, (c) I don’t mind about not having cafe au lait as an option.  I assume resolution and brightness of the screen is the same between KF7 and KF8 models, but haven’t done a side-by-side comparison. Machine feels heavy, but the wheels help. Based on excellent info. on this forum, I knew to lift the drip tray slightly as you insert it for the first time and pull it out for cleaning and put it back in - this is something I am going to have to nag my teenagers about given reports on here about how you can break a tab off if you use too much force. Surprised there was no setting to get it to turn on at 7am as with the Jura E8 (three years old). Delighted by the ease of the milk cleaning system plugging into the drip tray not a separate container like the E8. Wish the KF7 software did not prompt a cleaning after every milk drink but before turning off perhaps?  Wish the milk container was glass or there was an option to buy a metal milk pipe and glass milk container as with the Juras. I prefer the Juras' attached lid to the hopper and chute  vs. the removable lid in the KF7, but the KF7 lid does feel substantial and well made.

Coffee:

For me, the KF7 coffee was \*fantastic\* out of the box on the standard grinder setting with minor tweaks to temp, body, shot size and milk size etc, using beans from Lavazza, Peets and Illy.. I really can’t say I prefer the Juras over the KF7 - it’s equal or better to them in my opinion. This includes the ""espresso” based drinks like flat whites. Bonus: Peets MJD blend decaf in the chute is very nice. I do get a bit buzzed after them though and wonder how much caffeinated bean grounds remain in the machine before you get a “decaf only” drink out  Overall, though, given that the KF7 is a 1k machine with the discount, I am blown away by the taste out of this machine. Rivals the 4k Jura Z10 I’ve also used multiple times at a friend’s place and easily matches the Jura E8 I have at work, and the E4 I bought for home to test it against (returning now). I had to spend a lot more time dialing in the Juras.

Milk Temp: 

Lacking and I expected that, although being an optimist, I hoped it might be better. Also hoping the KF8 and KF7 are the same because I \*would\* have spent the additional $200 (with the Whirlpool Insider Pass) for the KF8 if I thought the KF8 milk was hotter. Using a thermopen I get 118-122 F max as it comes out of the KF7 spout using 2% from the fridge. I use a Jura cup warmer and because I like very hot drinks, I am finishing off in the microwave (please no judgy comments about how I don’t know coffee and I will burn the milk and ruin the drink.  I \*do\* know what I like and by the volume of comments on here I am not the only one who likes my drinks much hotter than a suuperauto other than the Z10 can provide). In other words, then, no advantage for the Jura E8 on milk temp, it’s about the same as the KF7, and the E4 is a coffee-only machine. If it were just me in the house, I might go with the E4 and do my own milk, but the E4 is $300 more than the KF7 and I have other household members who like milk drinks and are fine with the KF7  temp. Also… while I’ve spent a month doing my own microwaved milk with E4 coffee, I actually find the 20 seconds I need in the microwave with the KF7 is less of an issue than I thought it would be and the drinks are slightly better from KF7 machine milk plus microwave vs. E4 plus microwave.

Appearance:

Returning porcelain white for stainless. I strongly prefer the appearance of the piano white Juras with the silver accented nozzles over the KF7.  I just redid my kitchen with shiny white cabinets and bright quartz counters. I was hoping the Porcelain White would blend in. It doesn’t though. It looks cream/dirty white against the bright white kitchen. In terms of appearance, I also dislike the panel for the brew unit on the right side (ugly textured) of the KF7 vs. the clean lines of the right hand side of the Juras (you can’t get into the Juras brew units obviously, and I do like the fact that you can get into the brew unit in the KF7s to clean them, so it’s function over form).  I dislike the function of the water tank in the KF7 which you have to lift out, not lift and slide forward, like the Juras' so you can’t keep anything up against the left hand side of the KF7 unlike the Jura, which I had up against the cup warmer on the left. I also like the crystal-y look of the Juras water container. In the end I chose function and price over form and decided the KF7 was the better machine, better coffee, better value.  I called Whirlpool (20 mins to get through) and initiated a return of the porcelain white to get the aluminum. I don’t love aluminum like I love shiny white, but it will match my oven, fridge, dishwasher and not look as out of place as the porcelain white. If KitchenAid  made this machine in shiny white I’d be happy as a clam. No plans for that according to the person I spoke to.

There’s  been some discussion on here about returns on the Whirlpool pass. The US purchase page very clearly states you can return as follows:

""RETURNS & EXCHANGESMAJOR APPLIANCES Free 15 day returns or exchanges. Delivery & service fees will not be refunded, but you will not be charged any additional fees.”

I was told on the phone they do not do exchanges with the Insider Pass so I was given a return code (numerical) and told I would receive an email with a label within 48 hours, and I had to buy the stainless one again. I trust KitchenAid and want the new machine ASAP so I went ahead and purchased it immediately, without waiting for the refund. I have received confirmation of the new order, and a delivery estimate of Friday. I have not yet received the return label.

tl;dr: Buy the KitchenAid KF7 for fantastic coffee and value, esp with an Insider Pass. Porcelain white is a bit dingy looking against bright white.",3,1736794090.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

So this post was prompted by a question someone asked me. “What’s one things that stops entrepreneurs in their tracks?

I responded by saying ""Your biggest risk of failure is yourself”! We make mental mistakes. And the list of these typical cognitive errors typically comes down to a few of these:

* Misappraisal of competition
* Trying to compete on price
* Poor branding
* Trying to reinvent the wheel
* Offering too many options, and the list goes on.

What’s not on this list? The thing folks worry most about: **Competition.**

When we’re starting a project competition isn’t something we even think about.

There will always be competition. And so what. I take a quick glance at what they're doing, get some ideas if they're doing some great things, and then put my head down and get to work.

Competition is NOT why folks typically fail...not even close.

Here's the real tea:

**WANTREPRENEUR MISTAKES**

[Hanging out at home with new entrepreneurs](https://preview.redd.it/tsbu2zp33tce1.png?width=2376&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6764e4e877950164cbbaaed66065c0c82c277ea)

This is how folks convince themselves that their thing won't work. They're not even business mistakes, because there is no business. There are

""How can I stay safely on the sidelines"" mistakes. Some of these also fall nicely into the ""lies we tell ourselves that sound awesome"" category.

Anyhow, here they are:

* **I won't be able to compete with Amazon** or <insert huge company>"". Stop this silliness. This is not how any of this works.
* **I won't be able to offer it at that price.** And? Most decisions happen in isolation on your site. If your brand connects, you price at what you want.
* **Let me add a twist to this idea.** So, with no knowledge of the industry, you're better off reinventing the wheel vs executing on what you can SEE works? I mean I get little twists, but the bigger the twist the more risk of failure you introduce.
* **Let me add an api integration that will…** People complicate things, get overwhelmed, and never get out the gate. If you can do it with a spreadsheet, do it with a spreadsheet to get started.
* **Overthinking:** shopify or woocommerce, wordpress or squarespace, blah blah blah or blah blah...at the end of the day, expect less than 0% impact on your success from any of these decisions. Choose one and get to work!
* **""The market is saturated.""** No it isn't! This is the greatest bullshit ever. Beats everything else in this post actually.

**LAUNCH MISTAKES**

[Building our first product company](https://preview.redd.it/k2i0h9x93tce1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=6038f69e60c56ac6942555f73faa75dfcdbb6115)

A lot of these fall into the let me do the minimally viable product thing that is the commonly accepted startup mantra du jour. Folks have heard this repeated so much, that they’ve internalized it. How this often turns out:

* **I'll get out the gate with an ugly site just to validate**. Great! Nobody will put their credit card in your site and you'll conclude it won't work.
* **Validating with emails.** Hmm, I validate with credit card charges instead. 5 people buying is more of a validation than 500 emails captured on a pre-launch page.
* **Validating at all!** If your idea is so unique that it needs validation, you've increased your chances of failure. Why make your first business risky, when there are gazillion things that other people have already validated for you?
* **Making people guess what you're selling.** People should know what they're getting on your site in a split second. If you can't say it in one quick sentence on the above the fold section of your site, something is wrong.

**OPERATIONAL MISTAKES**

[Building a company at my crib](https://preview.redd.it/hc90hi4c3tce1.png?width=1616&format=png&auto=webp&s=6315b8e57ba7d32c6f10d81a40554224b180a842)

* **Let me lower my prices so I can compete**. Unless you're selling widgets, you should be competing on brand, not price.
* **Too many options.** One product/service at one price is the holy grail as far as I'm concerned. As a new entrepreneur each additional variable increases your logistical challenges, and confuses your customer. The more options, the lower the conversion rate, all things being equal.
* **Long forms:** Collect the minimum data you can collect to close the sale. Anything extra you need ask AFTER the sale is completed. The more fields the lower your conversion rates, all things being equal.
* **Being Cheap:** You don't buy the cheapest jeans, you don't buy the cheapest watch, you don't buy the cheapest phone. You go all out buying stuff, but some folks want the cheapest or free everything when it comes to investing in THEMSELVES.

**GENERAL MIS-FOCUS**

What matters? GETTING CUSTOMERS. What does it take: Branding & Marketing. If these aren't taking up 90% of your time, you're shooting yourself in the foot.

What folks spend time on instead? Oh this sweet widget that will cross populate emails to my cms so I can save 30 seconds on client interaction, and then making sure my team schedule integrates with my calendar so it automagically updates my availablity, and on and on and on...

All of this fancy stuff can come later. lol

**Build a business first, get revenue and then go to town. I was doing $60K per month off of Google spreadsheets, google calendar, and gmail.**

Focus on Getting CUSTOMERS!!!!!

And that's it. A non-exhaustive list, but this captures most of the stuff that I see folks doing and saying to either stay on the sidelines or set themselves up for failure.

And if you're someone that paid $80,000 for 4 years of college that left you with ONLY the skills to be an employee, but then you don't invest in yourself after that to get the skills to become an entrepreneur (while dreaming of someone else investing in you), I don't even know where to start.

Just wanted to say how much I appreciated this forum to learn what to expect etc.

My Urologist may have been skilled in his operation, but was absolutely no help before/after the surgery. I could feel his frustration when I contacted him. I guess thankful that he didn't mess anything up at least.

I got the bad boy out today, as others have mentioned, I'm born again today.

Sharing my experience for future stenters.

**Day0 (Day of operation)** : woke up from anesthesia, feeling fine. Immediately urge to pee and peed bright red urine with mild bearable pain (5/10). Discharged right after. After possibly the pain med wore off, peeing became excruciating pain at the urethra (9\~10/10). Just discomfort at the kidney. Endless dripping blood after pee. After 3 underwear change, I stopped changing. Urine started off bright red, then became yellower each time. Red urine became yellow urine with red streak of blood at some point.

**Day1** : Peeing pain became manageable (5\~6/10), urine color became dark red all over. No streak of blood since it was very red. Color did not improve with continued urine.

**Day2** : Starting from Day2, peeing pain slowly went down from 5 to 1\~2/10. Still dark red pee. But realized I'm constipated. With the urine building up in my ureter, my stomach ballooned up. Ended up drinking coffee (decaf) and milk and had first dump at night.

**Day3** : Urine color started improving. Changed to streak of blood. Would have felt more like a normal person, if only the string was not sticking out of my penis. Because of it, I could not go out or do anything. Because it gets large & small constantly, the tip of the string constantly went inside urethra, which I thought was good at first, but once it is set in the wrong place the tip will constantly poke inside the urethra. It eventually led to bright red blood dripping again. Meanwhile, coffee & milk just to make sure I dump.

**Day4** : First clear urine! With occasional bright red blood dripping due to string. First trip outside, only to come back shortly after because of string going inside urethra. Constant irritation and ouchy feeling due to string.

**Day5** : Day of self removal. Changed my minds several times before I went inside the shower to pull it. Started off with a very slow pull, maybe 1inch/5seconds and then rest for 10seconds. This went on for 5 minutes. Then, I found out I was getting nowhere. While resting, the string went back inside my urethra. So I changed to 1inch/1seconds pull without resting. Adjusted my grip after I saw the rubber. I thought it will never end, but it did end. Thank god!

Few advice : If you don't have anyone to take care of you after the surgery, make sure you have enough water and food that can be ready with few button presses. Get all the medication/drugs before the surgery. Prepare extra underwear. Do anything prior to the surgery, that you think can shorten your route inside the house.",1,1736793590.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False

1i0l1a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1i0l1a9/best_breville_for_an_espresso_beginner_1000/,Best Breville for an Espresso Beginner ($1000)?,"Hey Breville enthusiasts,

I’ve recently fallen in love with making my own lattes at work using our office espresso machine, and now I’m eager to bring the magic home. Luckily, my new job offers a $1000 bonus for setting up my home office, which includes coffee machines—so naturally, I’m using it for this!

I’m torn between three machines and would love your advice:

1. Breville Bambino Plus:
    - Pros: It has the auto-froth and temperature settings, which sound perfect for a beginner.
    - Cons: Its single-cup design seems limiting (can’t pull two espressos at once), and I’d need to buy a separate grinder, which adds to counter space.

2. Breville Barista Express Impress:
    - Pros: Love the aesthetics and the convenience of the built-in grinder.
    - Cons: Reviews suggest built-in grinders aren’t always great, and the lack of auto-frothing might make milk texturing a challenge for me.

3. Breville Barista Touch Impress (on sale for $1200):
    - Pros: It seems like the ultimate choice with an upgraded grinder, a touchscreen for recipes, and auto-froth settings.
    - Cons: The touchscreen makes me a bit wary of its durability, and it’s slightly over my $1000 budget.

My main priorities are ease of use (I’m still learning), the ability to create café-style lattes, and durability. Does anyone have experience with these machines? Or, should I consider other options entirely?

Any thoughts, tips, or guidance would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! 😊",3,1736793482.0,BrevilleCoffee,16,1.0,False

1i0kxwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1i0kxwp/better_performance_in_evening/,Better performance in evening.,"So, I have been cycling for almost three years and one thing that I have noticed is that cycling feels easy in my evening rides. Like I can easily maintain 27-28km/hr speeds in evening while in the morning pushing it beyond 25km/hr takes some effort.
Some reasons that I can think of are
1. Well fueld- I do my evening rides after having a good lunch and thus get good amount of carbs from it while I do my morning rides usually on a empty stomach with just black coffee.
2. Sleep - I usually sleep very late so most of the time I am doing my morning rides with only 2-3 hrs of sleep, while in my evening rides I am relatively more rested as I have already had a good night sleep+ a nap in afternoon as well.
3. Drafting - now this is something that I have recently thought of. During morning ride, streets are generally empty, and since I ride solo, there is nothing that is protecting me from winds or like helping me draft. But, during evening rides there is running traffic most of the time, so there are cars and bike around me and all going at speed of around 30km/hr. I don't exactly ride just behind vehicles, but still they might be somehow helping me in facing the wind. I don't know if this is true or what, it's just a theory.

So, if anyone can help me what might be the reason then please enlighten me. 
Also, I don't have a powermeter so cant confirm the drafting theory.",0,1736793255.0,cycling,4,0.5,False

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a couple of years now (don’t want to give away too many details, hence the throwaway) but in the past couple of months we’ve been having more disagreements. A bit of background is that about a year ago we almost broke up and I told her she has to improve herself if we want to keep dating, and she told me the same thing. She started doing some “self help” course that she thought helped her a lot and tried to get me to do it too, but I didn’t feel that I got much from it. Fast forward to more recently, I have been constantly trying to improve but I would get told multiple times per week that what I’m doing isn’t improving enough. In addition to that, she has told me multiple times I treat her “below the bare minimum” and that it’s the little things that matter. The thing is, I feel like I do a ton of little things and big things that get passed off as, according to her, “our bare minimum”. Some basic examples are I always open doors and car doors for her, I drive her to work and pick her up from work every time, when she has a lunch break I usually cook us lunch and eat with her, and if I don’t cook I’ll buy food out and eat with her. I’ve done an entire college course for her because she was enrolled but didn’t want to do it, I pay for almost everything, I carry all her things, and I feel like I always push things aside for her. She on the other hand, tells me that I don’t treat her as someone that is important to me, and I constantly put other things as more important than her. When we argue, I will often apologize for what I’ve done and try to take ownership over what I did wrong, but I don’t always specially use the words “I messed up” but i will say something like “that wasn’t ok of me to do, and I understand how what I did made you feel terrible. You didn’t deserve that and I apologize for putting you in that position. I am going to work on not repeating this action in the future…” and many times while explaining this and also not excusing but explaining my behavior, she will say I am excusing this behavior and not taking any accountability.

Recently, she has began getting upset at me over things I believe are very small or not even things she should get upset over. For example today, she talked to me about meeting up with a friend yesterday and we talked a bit about it. The topic of student ran clubs came up, and after she talked a bit about it I talked a bit about my experience with them and she got quiet. I asked her what was wrong, and she said I’m pissing her off and dragging on the conversation (I may have been, but I really did feel like I was just responding to what she was saying). After that she got more and more upset, whether I gave her time, physical touch, tried getting us coffee/drinks, or even just tried playing a show we like watching together. Eventually she asked me to take her home and she will get a ride elsewhere for her shift. She told me that I had the opportunity to make things better, and I told her I understand that but I also truly don’t know what I could have done to make her feel better. I didn’t give her a breakdown of everything I did, but I also want to know if someone has been in a similar place and what I could have possibly done differently. 

A couple weeks ago, she showed me some video that explains how women get mad at their man as their period approaches because “they aren’t pregnant” and their bodies are “mad at the man for not getting them pregnant” as a biological instinct, and last time we had a bunch of disagreements was close to her period. According to her period tracking app, if I understand correctly, she should be beginning her period some time this week. I don’t want to be one of those guys that just blames it on the period but after she herself blames her being so frustrated by me on it, I don’t really know how to feel.

I love this woman and I don’t want our relationship to end, but I feel like no matter what I do recently it pisses her off super quickly and she gets extra upset at me.

Instead of trying to fill pages or write profound thoughts, I gave myself permission to jot down just a sentence or two. “Today was exhausting” or “I’m grateful for coffee” counts as a journal entry. Once I let go of the pressure to write “perfectly,” journaling became less of a chore and more of a habit.

Now, some days I still write a lot, but on the days I don’t, I know that one line is enough. If you’ve ever struggled with consistency, remember: there’s no right or wrong way to journal. Showing up—even for a moment—is what matters most.",4,1736793041.0,InkAndInspiration,0,1.0,False

I wasn’t into fractional shares, but now I’m thinking this is the way to DCA a little without the sting of having to shell out a lot of money.  So you don’t have your daily coffee for a week and brew it at home.  After the week, you put in $40 worth of MSTR.  

Saylor doesn’t care about buying at highs or lows.  So in the same way, I’m thinking of buying a bit regularly without worrying so much about price.

It’s recognizing your divinity. And reintegrating with God (that is you/awareness). And thus realizing your power to create.

You can create without realizing you are God. But there will always be areas where you falter until you fully realize that you are God.

I’m not sure which came first, the chicken or the egg, here - did I have to “love myself” before I could believe I was god? Or did I have to realize I was god before I could fully love myself?

It seems like they both sort of came about at the exact same moment in a blinding miraculous flash. Since that moment the knowing and feeling has been with me near constantly.

If you’re not there yet, I want to try to nudge you in that direction with a few thoughts.

One, you’re probably getting pretty good at whatever technique you’re using to try to manifest something. Set an intention and start creating whatever it will take to “love yourself.” As always you don’t need to know what the middle is. Just make your most important manifestation you being whole and complete all on your own.

Trust me, this is what you really want. You can still have whatever it is you think you want right now, but it’ll be even better.

Two if the term “love yourself” bothers you, find other language. I always hated the phrase “I love myself” and still kinda do. But I love affirming that I trust myself (same feelings behind it as loving oneself). I love the phrase I am important and my needs are important. I love the phrase my body is beautiful and amazing and healthy. Other sort of “observational” statements that are statements of appreciation I have for myself. Since I realized I am god, “I am God, I am the creator” is my favorite thing ever!

For some reason “I love myself” always just felt unnatural to me.

Taking actions of caring for yourself are another huge thing you can do to reorient your mind. If you have a history of neglecting yourself taking small actions to change that can be tremendous. USE INTENTIONAL MANIFESTING FOR ALL OF THIS!

Imagine yourself loving the feeling of your new routine that includes going to the gym. Imagine the sense of well being and the sense of health you feel at the gym surrounded by other people doing positive things for themselves. Imagine yourself having close friendly relationships with people that provide caring services for you. I get my teeth cleaned every three months and I look forward to it, I view it as an act of loving care towards myself. Being a dentistryphobe and neglecting my oral health was always a thing for me. 2 years ago I broke a tooth and decided to force myself to get all the dental work done that I needed. My teeth looked ok but needed tons of fillings replaced, new fillings, crowns, it was crazy and harrowing. Halfway through I decided screw it, I'm getting Invisalign too, I'm taking this as far as it can go. Now every time I look in the mirror and see my perfect teeth I remember what past me did for NOW me. The more I rack up things like that the better I feel. It's with you all the time.

I know that the right relationship to yourself is key - I’ve been a master creator in all of the areas where I never had a skewed relationship with myself. Creating wealth was easy because mentally the state of having everything I needed and wanted was natural to me, and from a young age my intelligence and capability was drilled into me. Not so much in the arenas of personal relationships, and my importance as a person in general, and confidence in myself physically. Before I started consciously changing those areas with the intention of creating deliberately, I used will to begin changing things I didn’t like and always saw improvement in those areas as my approval of myself grew.

All roads lead back to your relationship with/view of yourself. If you are struggling here, manifest the next step in your journey to completeness while you’re manifesting your next free cup of coffee.

There are moments of divine and utter bliss that await, bliss you’ve never experienced from the love of your SP or success in any ego driven pursuit. Moments of being awash in a sense of utter well being and belonging. It’s awesome.",12,1736792883.0,NevilleGoddess,0,1.0,False

\--------------------------

The lecture hall was half-empty, as expected for a Friday afternoon. Most of the students who bothered to show up looked about halfway alive themselves—hoods up, laptops open to who-knows-what, and a scattering of glazed-over expressions that made it painfully clear their minds were everywhere else but the class. 

Lucas Voss stood at the lectern, adjusting the mic with the slow, deliberate movements of someone who’d done this far too many times to count. His tie was askew, his brown blazer slightly wrinkled, and the faint shadow of stubble on his face suggested he'd skipped shaving that morning. Still, his voice carried with it a measured energy as he began.

“Life,” he said, letting the word hang in the air. “It’s resilient. Stubborn, even. You can freeze it, boil it, starve it, irradiate it, drop it into acid, toss it into the vacuum of space—and somehow, it’ll survive.”

He clicked a button on his laptop, and an image of a boiling hot spring appeared on the overhead screen. The colors rippled and shimmered—a surreal blend of orange, yellow, and green. “Take this, for example. Yellowstone’s Grand Prismatic Spring. The water temperature here averages around 70 degrees Celsius, that's 158 degrees Fahrenheit—hot enough to poach an egg. Not exactly what most of us would call hospitable. But, unmistakably, there’s still life there.”

He scanned the room, searching for a flicker of engagement among the students. A few avoided his gaze, feigning deep concentration on their notebooks or phones. Others looked blank. Lucas sighed.

“Thermophiles,” he continued. “Bacteria and archaea that thrive in conditions so extreme they’d kill us in seconds. Their enzymes—heat-stable proteins—allow them to not just exist, but thrive, in these temperatures. Now, why does this matter?”

A few students looked up from their phones, a slight hum of interest in their eyes. Lucas allowed himself a small, tired smile. He leaned forward on the lectern, gripping its edges.

“It means we don’t know everything. Not even close. Biology isn’t a static set of rules. It’s a spectrum of possibilities. Every time we think we’ve reached the limit of where life can exist, nature moves the goalpost.”

Lucas clicked the remote. The next slide displayed images of brightly colored bacteria blooming in acidic hot springs, polar ice cores drilled thousands of feet below the surface, and a magnified photo of the rugged, spore-like structure of *Deinococcus radiodurans*.

“What about acid-loving extremophiles like *Ferroplasma acidarmanus*? These guys thrive in mine drainage with a pH of one. That’s more acidic than stomach acid. And then there’s *Deinococcus radiodurans*—an extremophile so resilient to radiation we nicknamed it ‘Conan the Bacterium.’ In fact,” he paused for effect, “if you blasted *Deinococcus* with enough radiation to obliterate any other living thing, it would only need a few hours to repair its DNA. Hours.”

He clicked the remote again. A slide of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent appeared—black smoke billowing into inky darkness, surrounded by eerie, glowing life forms. “This is a black smoker, 2,500 meters below the ocean’s surface. Water temperatures exceed 400 degrees Celsius, 752 degrees Fahrenheit. There’s no sunlight, no oxygen, at least in the traditional sense, and yet—” he gestured to the screen, “—these ecosystems flourish. Tube worms, crabs, bacteria. They don’t just pass through here; they depend on these conditions.”

A hand shot up. This one belonged to a wiry kid in a Chicago Bears hoodie. “How do they, like, breathe? Or eat? There’s no sunlight, right?”

“Good question,” Lucas said, nodding. “They don’t use sunlight like we’re used to. Instead, they rely on chemosynthesis. Their energy comes from chemicals—sulfur, hydrogen sulfide—spewed out by the vents. It’s alien compared to the photosynthesis you learned in high school, but it works.”

He let the thought linger as he moved toward the next slide, an image of Tardigrades—tiny, eight-legged creatures with bizarre, plump bodies. “And then, there are these little guys. Tardigrades. Water bears. Microscopic animals that can survive practically anything. They’ve been boiled, frozen, dehydrated, blasted with radiation, and even sent to space, exposed to the vacuum and solar radiation. They always came back alive.”

A few murmurs rippled through the hall. Lucas felt a faint flicker of satisfaction. At least they weren’t entirely asleep.

“They’ve survived environments that should be universally fatal. And again, it forces us to ask: If life can survive these conditions, where else might it be hiding? Beneath the ice of Europa? In the sulfuric clouds of Venus? Even—” he paused for effect, “—right here, in places we haven’t looked yet?”

The room grew quieter, the hum of the air conditioner filling the silence. He scanned the faces in the crowd. Maybe a third were paying attention now. Not bad.

A voice from the front broke the stillness. It was a girl in a flannel shirt, her brow furrowed in concentration. “So… if there are extremophiles here on Earth, does that mean extraterrestrial life would look similar? Like bacteria and stuff?”

Lucas hesitated, considering how best to answer. He leaned back against the lectern, crossing his arms. “It’s possible. But there’s a catch. Extremophiles here evolved to survive extreme conditions because those environments already existed. They didn’t create the conditions themselves.”

“So?” the girl pressed.

“So,” Lucas said, “life somewhere else might follow rules we can’t even imagine. If it’s evolved in conditions completely alien to us, it might not look—or act—like anything we’d recognize as life. That’s the real question: How much of what we know is shaped by what we expect to find?”

A hand went up in the back row. It was a guy in a backwards cap, his face unreadable. “You mean, like, the Fermi Paradox?”

Lucas raised an eyebrow. “Hey, someone was doing their reading. Do you remember the jist of it?”

“Yeah,” the student said, shrugging. “It’s basically, if the universe is so big, how come we haven’t found aliens yet?”

“Exactly,” Lucas said. “The Fermi Paradox. On paper, the numbers say we should’ve found something—or been found—by now. But we haven’t. Why?”

A few students perked up, waiting for an answer. Lucas didn’t give them one immediately. He let the silence stretch, leaning on the lectern and watching their faces.

“Maybe it’s because we’re looking for the wrong things,” he said finally. “Maybe they’re out there, but they’re so different from us that we can’t recognize them. Or maybe—” his voice dropped slightly, “—we’re the extremophiles. Maybe, to them, we’re the weird, impossible organisms living on a hostile rock in the middle of nowhere.”

The room stayed quiet. Lucas glanced at the clock. A minute past the hour.

“All right,” he said, snapping his laptop shut. “That’s all for today. Read chapters six and seven before next week. We’ll talk about extremophiles’ applications in biotechnology, and yes, there will be a quiz. Have a good weekend.”

The students began packing up, the room filling with the scrape of chair legs and the rustling of backpacks. Lucas gathered his things slowly, letting the noise wash over him. He caught snippets of conversation as they filed out—fragments of plans for parties, complaints about assignments, the kind of idle chatter he’d heard a thousand times before.

“Professor Voss?”

He looked up to see the girl in the flannel lingering near the lectern.

“Yeah?”

“Do you really think we’re, like, the weird ones? Compared to aliens?”

Lucas smiled faintly. “I think weirdness is a matter of perspective. To us, tardigrades are strange. To them, we’re probably the freaks.”

She nodded thoughtfully, then turned to leave.

When the room was finally empty, Lucas sat down heavily in one of the front-row seats. He rubbed his eyes, exhaustion settling over him like a lead blanket. Teaching was the part of the job he still enjoyed, but it was getting harder to muster the energy. The university’s budget cuts meant more administrative work, larger class sizes, and less time for research—the thing he’d actually signed up for.

His phone buzzed on the lectern. He picked it up and squinted at the screen.

**Evelyn Cho:** *Need you to look at something. Lab 3C. Now.*

Lucas sighed, stuffing the phone into his pocket. Evelyn was brilliant, but she had a knack for dramatics. Whatever it was could probably wait until Monday.

Still, he found himself standing, slinging his bag over his shoulder. Curiosity had always been his weakness.

“Just one thing,” he muttered to himself as he headed for the door. “Then I’m done for the day.”

—

Lucas Voss stepped into Lab 3C, letting the heavy door close behind him with a soft hiss. The air was thick with the burning scent of disinfectant and faint traces of ammonia. Fluorescent lights chattered overhead, cascading a sterile glow over endless rows of counters cluttered with microscopes, centrifuges, and racks of labeled test tubes. Evelyn Cho stood at the far end of the room, hunched over a microscope, her dark hair pulled into a messy ponytail.

“Lucas,” she called without looking up. Her voice carried an edge, a mixture of urgency and irritation. “Close the door all the way. It messes with the airflow.”

He nudged the door with his heel until it clicked into place. “What’s so important it couldn’t wait until Monday?”

Evelyn straightened, her eyes bloodshot and shadowed, as if she hadn’t slept that night. She gestured toward a set of slides on the counter. “That. Take a look.”

Lucas sighed, dropping his bag onto a stool before stepping over. “You know, the thing about emergencies is they usually involve actual danger. Like fire. Or blood.”

Evelyn didn’t smile. Instead, she adjusted the focus on the microscope and motioned for him to sit. “Just look.”

He slid onto the stool and peered into the eyepiece. At first, it seemed like an ordinary cell sample—irregular shapes floating in suspension, faintly illuminated against the black backdrop. But as he adjusted the fine focus, his brow furrowed. These cells weren’t ordinary. Their structure was intricate, with a complexity that bordered on baffling. Thin, branching filaments extended from the outer membranes, resembling the nervous dendrites of a brain cell. But it wasn’t just their complexity that was unique—it was their groupings. The cells seemed to cluster in patterns that evoked something oddly familiar, he just couldn’t place why.

“What am I looking at?” he asked, his voice low.

“That’s what I’ve been trying to figure out,” Evelyn said, pacing behind him. “I pulled the sample from Lake Michigan three days ago. It was part of a routine environmental survey. We were checking for invasive species and pollutants after those blackouts last month.”

Lucas straightened, giving her a skeptical look. “And you found… this?”

She nodded, folding her arms across her chest. “At first, I thought it was just contamination. Maybe some lab tech got careless during collection. But then I started running tests.”

“What kind of tests?”

“Staining, metabolic assays, sequencing,” she said, ticking them off on her fingers. “These cells aren’t a match for anything in our databases. Not bacteria, not algae, not protists. And they’re… active.”

“Active how?”

“Watch.”

Evelyn grabbed a tablet and swiped through a series of videos before handing it to him. The screen displayed time-lapse footage of a petri dish under a microscope. At first, it was just the cells, suspended in a drop of liquid. But as the video progressed, the cells began to move—not randomly, but with an eerie, coordinated purpose. They clustered into branching patterns, then separated, then re-formed. It was almost as if they were building something.

Lucas leaned back, handing the tablet back to her. “That’s… unusual.”

Evelyn’s jaw tightened. “I’m not trying to jump to conclusions. But you can’t deny this is strange. And it gets weirder.”

Pulling up another video, she set the tablet on the counter. This one showed a slice of tissue suspended in a nutrient solution. The cells in the tissue appeared to ripple and pulse faintly, as though responding to an invisible signal.

Lucas frowned. “Is that… alive?”

“Yes. Or something close to it.” Evelyn folded her arms. “The tissue isn’t from any known organism, at least not as far as I can tell. It doesn’t decay. It doesn’t reject the nutrient solution. It just… exists.”

“That doesn’t make sense,” Lucas muttered. He rubbed his temples, trying to process what he’d just seen. “You’re sure this isn’t some bizarre mutation of known cells? Maybe something introduced by industrial runoff or—”

“No.” Evelyn cut him off. “I ran every test I could think of. These cells don’t just survive—they adapt. Look at this.”

She picked up a slide and slipped it under the microscope. Lucas leaned in again, his stomach tightening. The cells were shifting right before his eyes, their branching filaments retracting and extending, reconfiguring themselves as if testing the limits of their environment.

“This can’t be real,” he said, pulling back.

“It’s real,” Evelyn said firmly. “And it’s spreading.”

Lucas blinked. “What do you mean, spreading?”

Evelyn swiped through more files on the tablet, pulling up a map of Lake Michigan. Red dots marked several areas along the shoreline. “These are the locations where I’ve found similar samples. Each day, the range expands. Whatever this is, it’s moving.”

“Moving how?”

She hesitated. “I don’t know. But the lake’s ecosystem is starting to show anomalies. Dead fish with internal mutations. Algae blooms that don’t photosynthesize. And the seismic activity—”

“Seismic activity?” Lucas interrupted.

Evelyn nodded. “The geology department reported a series of minor tremors along the lakebed last week. Nothing big, but unusual enough to raise eyebrows. And they’re localized to the same areas where the anomalies are showing up.”

Lucas exhaled slowly, his mind racing. This was beyond anything he’d encountered in his career. But he couldn’t shake the feeling that Evelyn was seeing patterns where there might not be any. “Look,” he said carefully, “I don’t doubt you’ve found something interesting. But we need more data before we start jumping the gun on anything. This could still be a natural phenomenon—a rare one, sure, but natural.”

Evelyn shook her head, her frustration evident. “Lucas, you saw the cells. You saw how they move, how they adapt. Does any of this feel natural to you?”

He didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he stared at the microscope, the image of those unnervingly human-like cells still fresh in his mind. Finally, he sighed. “I’ll help you run more tests. But let’s stick to what we know for now. No wild theories.”

Evelyn nodded reluctantly. “Fine. But you’ll see. This is bigger than either of us realizes.”

—

The air along the Lake Michigan shoreline carried the damp chill of early spring, a biting wind that cut through Lucas’s jacket. He tightened the zipper as he stepped out of Evelyn’s car, his boots crunching on the gravel parking lot of a small, rarely-used boat launch. The sky was overcast, a slate gray expanse that seemed to press down on the lake, robbing it of its usual shimmer. The water lay flat and still, an expanse of muted blue that stretched endlessly to the horizon.

Evelyn popped the trunk, pulling out a pair of insulated cases and a collection of sample vials. “We’ll start at the pier,” she said, her voice brisk. “Then move out to the deeper spots. The tremors seem to be focused a few hundred meters offshore.”

Lucas hoisted a portable water pump and slung it over his shoulder. “You think this’ll give us anything different from the lab samples?”

“Maybe, maybe not.” Evelyn said, slamming the trunk shut. “But, if there is a pattern, we need to confirm it. You said it yourself—more data.”

He sighed, adjusting his grip on the pump. “Yeah. More data.”

The two of them walked down a narrow path to the water’s edge, their footsteps muffled by the damp soil. A few seagulls wheeled overhead, their cries sharp against the relative silence. There were no fishermen, no joggers, not even the occasional dog-walker. The area felt abandoned, its emptiness lending the scene an off-putting backdrop.

They eventually reached a small private pier—a short, weathered stretch of wood jutting into the lake—and set up their equipment. Evelyn handed Lucas a sterile collection bottle, her movements precise and methodical.

“I’ll start the pump,” Lucas said, kneeling to connect the intake tube. He lowered it into the water, watching as it rippled slightly before disappearing beneath the surface. The pump hummed to life, and within moments, clear water began flowing into the collection bottle.

Evelyn crouched beside him, holding up a handheld monitor. “pH is normal,” she murmured. “Turbidity, too.”

“Not exactly the smoking gun,” Lucas said. He capped the first bottle and set it aside, then began filling another. “You really think we’ll find anything unusual out here?”

Evelyn glanced at the lake, her brow furrowing. “Like I said, I don’t know,” she admitted. “But if the samples in the lab are showing activity, it’s coming from somewhere.”

They worked in silence for the next half hour, collecting water samples and cataloging their locations. Evelyn moved with a sense of urgency, her focus intense. Lucas couldn’t help but feel like they were chasing shadows. Yet, as the pump pulled water from the depths, a nagging unease settled in his chest.

When they’d filled the last bottle, Evelyn stood and stretched, wincing slightly. “Let’s check the deeper spots. I brought the sonar.”

Lucas arched an eyebrow. “Sonar?”

“I borrowed it from the geology department,” she said, brushing past him toward the car. “If there’s seismic activity, I want to see if it’s affecting the lakebed.”

He followed her back to the parking lot, where she retrieved a small sonar device and a collapsible pole. They spent the next hour walking the shoreline, stopping every hundred meters to lower the device into the water. Evelyn monitored the readings while Lucas recorded the data in a notebook.

“Anything interesting?” he asked, shoving his hands into his pockets to ward off the cold.

Evelyn frowned at the screen. “Not sure. There’s definitely some irregularity along the sediment layers. Could be minor subsidence from the tremors, but…”

“But?”

She hesitated, then shook her head. “It doesn’t match the usual patterns. I’ll need to analyze the data back at the lab.”

They continued their survey until the sky began to darken, the wind picking up and sending waves crashing softly against the shore. By the time they returned to the car, Lucas’s legs ached, and his fingers were numb despite his gloves.

“Done for the day?” he asked, placing the last piece of equipment in the trunk.

“For now,” Evelyn said, closing the lid. “I want to run these samples as soon as we get back. You coming?”

Lucas shook his head. “I’ve got papers to grade. And I’m overdue for something resembling dinner.”

Evelyn gave him a faint smile, the first he’d seen all day. “Fair enough. Thanks for the help.”

He nodded, climbing into the passenger seat. As they drove back toward the university, the city lights began to flicker to life, casting long reflections on the water. Lucas stared out the window, his mind drifting. Despite his skepticism, he couldn’t shake the image of the cells in Evelyn’s lab—the way they moved, the deliberate precision of their patterns. It felt wrong, in a way he couldn’t quite articulate.

By the time Evelyn dropped him off, it was nearly nine. Lucas waved her off and trudged up the steps to his apartment, unlocking the door with a tired sigh. The familiar clutter greeted him: stacks of books and journals, a half-empty mug of coffee on the counter, a coat draped over a chair. He tossed his bag onto the couch and headed for the kitchen, fixing himself a sandwich before collapsing into an armchair.

He ate in silence, the hum of the refrigerator the only sound. When he finished, he set the plate aside and rubbed his temples. His thoughts felt scattered, heavy. The day’s events swirled in his mind, refusing to settle. Finally, he stood and made his way to the bedroom, peeling off his shirt before collapsing onto the bed.

Sleep came quickly, but it was not peaceful.

—

The dreams began as fragments, disjointed images that flickered and shifted with incomprehensible fluidity. Lucas stood in a vast expanse of gray, the ground rippling beneath his feet like the surface of a liquid. In the distance, monolithic structures loomed—towering spires of bone and stone, their surfaces etched with intricate patterns that seemed to writhe and pulse.

As he moved closer, the spires folded inward, collapsing and reshaping into something unrecognizable. The ground beneath him shifted, fracturing into a mosaic of jagged tiles. He stumbled, his balance unsteady, and looked down to see the tiles rearranging themselves into symbols he didn’t recognize but somehow understood.

The air grew heavy, thick with an oppressive hum that resonated in his chest. Shapes moved at the edges of his vision—impossible forms that defied logic, their presence both overwhelming and imperceptible. He turned to run, but the landscape folded around him, the horizon twisting into a spiral that dragged him forward.

Suddenly, he was inside a city—a labyrinth of organic and mechanical structures fused together in grotesque harmony. Walls rippled like muscle, and streets curved and branched like veins. The city seemed alive, sentient with millions of independent minds, each of their presences pressing against his thoughts with an unbearable weight. He tried to speak, to scream, but no sound came.

At the center of it all stood a figure, towering and alien. Its form was fluid, shifting between solidity and transparency, its surface covered in spiraling patterns that burned into his vision. It turned toward him, and though it had no face, Lucas felt its gaze—cold, probing, endless, *intimate*.

The hum grew louder, a deafening crescendo that filled his head with static. The city began to collapse, folding inward like a collapsing star. Lucas reached out, desperate to grasp something, anything, as the world dissolved into darkness.

—

He woke with a gasp, his heart pounding, his sheets damp with sweat. The room was dark, the only light coming from the faint glow of his alarm clock. 3:17 a.m.

Lucas sat up, rubbing his face with trembling hands. The dream clung to him, vivid and oppressive, its images burned into his mind. He glanced around the room, half-expecting the walls to ripple or the floor to shift beneath him. But everything was still.

“Just a dream,” he muttered, his voice hoarse. “Just a dream.”

He swung his legs over the side of the bed, planting his feet firmly on the floor. The cool hardwood steadied him, grounding him in the present. Taking a deep breath, he stood and walked to the kitchen, flipping on the light. He poured himself a glass of water and drank it slowly, trying to calm his racing thoughts.

But as he stared out the window at the quiet city below, a gnawing unease settled in his chest. The dream felt too real, too precise. And though he couldn’t explain why, he couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t just a dream. It was a promise.",2,1736792775.0,StrangeAccounts,0,1.0,False

In the past months, I conducted multiple experiments with programmatic SEO and would like to share some tips here. By the end of this guide, I hope you’ll learn how *not* to go about programmatic SEO, so your website doesn’t get into Google’s spam filters — as happened to one of my experiments. This guide will cover:

1. How to come up with an idea?
2. Keyword research and tools
3. Why is buying a good domain name important?
4. Backlink building and why it is important
5. Future of programmatic SEO

# 1. How to Come Up with an Idea?

Every successful programmatic SEO project starts with a solid idea. But how do you come up with one? Start by identifying a niche or industry you’re passionate about or familiar with. Your understanding of the niche can provide a competitive edge.

If you can’t come up with an idea easily, it means you need to do some research. There are tons of ways to generate ideas, and I’ll list a few effective methods here.

**Find Datasets with Poor UI and Transform Them into Great Websites**

One of the best platforms for discovering datasets is **Kaggle**, which hosts thousands of searchable datasets. As of now, Kaggle lists more than 400,000 datasets.

***Pro Tip:*** *Transforming datasets with subpar interfaces into user-friendly and visually appealing websites can be a winning strategy.*

**Leverage Your Own Datasets to Gain a Competitive Advantage**

If you run an existing business or side hustle, chances are you already have access to data that no one else has.

For example, consider the **JobTest** website. Users complete a quiz and receive career recommendations based on their answers to multiple-choice questions. This unique data could easily be utilized to create programmatic SEO pages, giving you a significant edge over competitors.

JobTest could easily use their quiz data to create **skill-based pages** that highlight careers suited to specific skills identified in the quiz, such as problem-solving or creativity. For instance, pages like */careers-for-problem-solvers* or */careers-for-creative-thinkers* could summarize job opportunities for individuals with these strengths. These pages could rank for searches like “Careers for creative people” or “Jobs for problem solvers.”

**Scrape publicly available data and transform it with existing AI tools**

If you don’t have proprietary data, another great option is to scrape publicly available data. The key is not just scraping but transforming this raw data into something unique, insightful, and user-friendly. For example:

• Scrape real estate listings and create a hyper-localized property directory.

• Collect restaurant menu data to build a comprehensive food discovery platform.

• Use AI tools like GPT-based models or Stable Diffusion for creative enhancements such as summarizing reviews, generating captions, or even creating visuals.

**Start Backward: Understand Monetization First**

Before finalizing your idea, it’s crucial to think about **how you’ll monetize your website**. This should be a significant factor in your decision-making process. A brilliant idea without a clear path to revenue can lead to wasted effort and frustration.

• Will you monetize through **ads**, **affiliate marketing**, or **direct sales**?

• Does the niche have products, services, or opportunities with sufficient earning potential?

• Are there high-value keywords or industries you can target for premium ad placements?

 ***The key takeaway.*** *A successful programmatic SEO idea solves a real user problem while leveraging unique or underutilized data to create value — and has a clear path to monetization. Once you have your idea, you’re ready to move on to the next step —* ***keyword research***\*!\*

# 2. Keyword Research and Tools

Everyone knows tools like **Ahrefs**, **SEMRush**, and similar SEO platforms. We also know they can be expensive as hell! If you can afford them, great — but there are effective, **free alternatives** to get you started.

A combination of **Google Ads Keyword Planner**, **Google Trends**, and (if possible) a short-term subscription to Ahrefs can work wonders for your keyword research workflow. Even if you subscribe to Ahrefs for just one month, it should provide enough value to kickstart your process. Let me break down how to use these tools together for maximum efficiency.

**Start with Google Ads Keyword Planner: Finding Keyword Opportunities**

Google Ads Keyword Planner is fantastic for discovering high-volume, low-competition keywords. Here’s how to use it effectively:

• **Search for Seed Keywords**: Start with a broad keyword related to your niche. For example, if you’re building a **directory for board games**, you might begin with **“board games”** as your seed keyword. From there, explore related categories like **Popular board games (**“best board games 2025”, “top-rated board games.”, etc)

• **Analyze Metrics**: Look at the **search volume** and **competition**. Prioritize keywords with:

* Moderate to high search volume (e.g., >= 1K searches per month).
* Low to medium competition (keep in mind this metric relates to paid ads, but it still gives a rough idea of keyword viability).

• **Look for Trends**: Use the **“Year-over-Year Change”** metric to identify keywords with growing popularity. For example, if **“solo board games”** or **“board games for couples”** shows a significant increase in search volume over the past year, it indicates rising demand.

 ***Pro Tip:*** *Export your keyword list and organize it by search volume and competition. This will help you prioritize effectively.*

**Use Google Trends: Validating Growth Potential**

Google Trends is a great tool for validating the potential of keywords identified in Keyword Planner. Here’s how to integrate it into your workflow:

• **Check Seasonal Trends**: Search for your keyword in Google Trends to see its popularity over time. For example, “**board games**” might spike in the winter months, indicating seasonal demand.

• **Compare Related Keywords**: Use the comparison feature to check multiple related keywords. For instance, compare “**solo board games**” and “**board games for couples**” to see which has the most consistent or growing interest.

• **Spot Emerging Trends**: Look at related queries and “rising” terms for ideas that are gaining traction but aren’t yet oversaturated.

***Pro Tip:*** *Filter by location and timeframe to get insights tailored to your target audience (e.g., “United States” and “past 12 months”).*

**Leverage Ahrefs: Deep Dive into Keyword and Competitor Analysis**

If you can afford Ahrefs, even for a month, it can add a lot of depth to your research.

• **Check Keyword Difficulty (KD)**: Ahrefs provides a **Keyword Difficulty** score, helping you identify terms that are easier to rank for. Combine this with the volume data from Keyword Planner for a more informed decision.

• **Analyze Competitor Pages**: Enter the top-ranking URLs for your target keywords into Ahrefs’ **Site Explorer**. Look for:

* Content gaps: Topics or subtopics that competitors missed.
* Backlink profiles: Opportunities for your site to acquire similar backlinks.

• **Discover Long-Tail Keywords**: Use the “Questions” feature in Ahrefs to find long-tail variations of your keywords. These are often easier to rank for and attract highly targeted traffic.

• **Monitor Trends with SERP Features**: Ahrefs shows which SERP features (e.g., featured snippets, FAQs) dominate for a given keyword. This insight can help you optimize your content format.

**How to Combine These Tools Effectively**

1. **Start Broad (Keyword Planner)**: Use Google Ads Keyword Planner to generate a list of potential keywords with volume and competition data.

2. **Refine and Validate (Google Trends)**: Cross-check these keywords in Google Trends to identify seasonal patterns and validate their growth potential.

3. **Deep Dive (Ahrefs)**: For your top 10–20 keywords, use Ahrefs to:

* Assess competition.
* Analyze top-ranking pages.
* Discover long-tail variations.

4. **Iterate**: Repeat the process for additional keyword ideas, refining your list as you go.

**Final Tip**\*: The sweet spot is identifying keywords with:\*

*•* ***High search volume.***

*•* ***Low keyword difficulty (KD).***

*•* ***Consistent or growing interest over time.***

*•* ***Room for unique content (e.g., underserved niches or content gaps).***

# 3. Why Buying a Good Domain Name Is Important

Your domain name is the cornerstone of your website’s identity. It’s the first impression potential visitors get, often before they’ve even clicked through to your site. Imagine browsing search results for information about coffee brewing. Would you trust [**coffeelovers.org**](http://coffeelovers.org) or **best-coffee-for-you123.info**? The difference is stark, and it shows why your choice of domain matters. A well-chosen domain can establish trust, improve visibility, and make your site memorable, while a poorly chosen one can do the opposite.

**Extensions Matter Too**

While the coveted **.com** extension is often the first choice, it’s not the only viable option. In fact, alternatives like **.org** or **.net** can lend credibility, especially for non-commercial or informational sites. For instance, a directory for community art projects might thrive with a name like [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org), suggesting a resource-driven platform. Meanwhile, opting for an unusual or unfamiliar extension — think **.xyz** or **.biz** — can raise red flags for users accustomed to more traditional domains.

# Good and Bad Examples Speak for Themselves

***Good Examples:***

1. [**bookfinder.org**](http://bookfinder.org) — Straightforward, professional, and clearly conveys its purpose.

2. [**studyresources.net**](http://studyresources.net) — Focused and reliable, suitable for an educational platform.

3. [**localarts.org**](http://localarts.org) — Suggests a trustworthy and community-driven resource for art projects.

4. [**healthdirect.org**](http://healthdirect.org) — Clean and professional, ideal for a healthcare directory.

***Bad Examples:***

1. [**books-4u-online.info**](http://books-4u-online.info) — Cluttered with unnecessary symbols and a weak extension.

2. [**studies-helper101.biz**](http://studies-helper101.biz) — Overly generic and unprofessional, with a questionable extension.

3. [**local-artz.xyz**](http://local-artz.xyz) — Misspelling and unfamiliar extension reduce credibility.

4. [**healthfindersnow123.com**](http://healthfindersnow123.com) — Hard to remember and untrustworthy due to random numbers.

***Pro Tip***\*:\* *When brainstorming a domain, imagine telling someone about it verbally. If you’d need to explain the spelling, symbols, or numbers, it’s not the right choice. Stick with clarity and simplicity to make your site easy to trust and revisit.*

# 4. Backlink Building and Why It Is Important

Backlinks are the lifeblood of SEO. They signal to search engines that your website is valuable and trustworthy, helping you rank higher and attract more visitors. For new websites, backlinks are even more critical — they’re like a stamp of approval that gets you noticed. But not all backlinks are created equal. Here’s how to build them the right way.

**List Your Website on Relevant Directories**

Directories aren’t just for directories — they’re a solid starting point for any website. Find directories that are closely related to your niche and list your site there. Be selective. Posting your link on random, irrelevant directories will do more harm than good, spoiling your website’s profile in the eyes of search engines.

***Pro Tip***\*: If your website is about sustainable fashion, list it on directories focused on eco-friendly living, fashion resources, or green business tools. Avoid directories that are generic dumping grounds for random links — they can hurt your credibility.\*

**Engage on Social Media**

Social media platforms like Facebook groups or Twitter threads can also be effective. The key is to engage authentically. No one likes a spammer, but everyone appreciates a valuable resource.

**Comment on Blogs and Articles**

Find blogs, news articles, or discussion threads relevant to your website’s niche. Comment thoughtfully and add your link only when it adds value. Even if these links are “nofollow” (meaning they don’t pass much SEO value), they still help with visibility and may drive direct traffic.

For instance, if your website is about home fitness, look for articles about workout trends, leave insightful comments, and link to your site where it genuinely contributes to the conversation.

**Work Long Enough, and Opportunities Will Find You**

Building backlinks takes time, but here’s the thing: if you consistently create high-quality content and keep improving your website, opportunities will come your way. Influencers will notice your work, bloggers will link to it, and other websites will want to collaborate.

Patience is the name of the game. Focus on making your website so good that people can’t ignore it. Keep improving, keep sharing, and let your work speak for itself.

# 5. Future of programmatic SEO

The rise of AI is reshaping how people interact with information online. Standard content-based websites are at risk of becoming obsolete as AI generates instant answers to questions. But directories and programmatic SEO projects built around datasets have a unique advantage — **they offer functionality that AI or plain text cannot replicate effectively.**

When users need to compare multiple options — whether it’s products, services, or anything else — a text-based AI response just doesn’t cut it. The best user experience for comparisons is visual and interactive. Think side-by-side comparisons, sortable tables, and detailed filters. These are features that programmatic SEO excels at, and they’re something AI simply can’t deliver in a conversational format.

For example:

• **Visualization**: Allow users to explore data through graphs, heatmaps, or charts.

• **Interactive Comparisons**: Enable users to scroll through lists, filter by specific attributes, or compare options side by side.

• **Niche-Specific Insights**: Build tools tailored to your dataset, like calculators, personalized recommendations, or resource aggregators.

In a future where AI dominates traditional Q&A searches, programmatic SEO websites that focus on functionality and unique datasets will thrive. They won’t just provide information — they’ll empower users to interact with it in ways that AI-generated text cannot.",1,1736792709.0,SEO_Digital_Marketing,1,1.0,False

""To prevent any unexpected long-term issues, we'd recommend against using reverse osmosis or distilled water for brewing with Aiden. This is because using true distilled or RO water with 0 TDS can pull minerals out of some of the components used in Aiden""

Now trying to get more detailed information about what the ""unexpected long-term issues"" might be.  Is there a health risk from the minerals that can leach out of the Aiden, or is it just a potential functional problem with the brewer?  And what specific problems may arise over what time frame?  I've contacted Fellow support waiting for a response.  I do use a Zero Water filter and want to make an informed decision.  So far my tests with TWW have significantly changed the coffee taste, and not in a positive way.  Also, the added steps of treating the water will take some adjustment.

I eventually switched to Zyn, but I moved to a state that banned ""flavored"" tobacco, including the spearmint zyn so I started smoking again, then switched to vapes that I would drive out of state for. I stuck with the vapes for the last 4.5 yrs and I swear they were harder to put down than cigarettes. I WFH and would sit there hitting that vape all day everyday, everywhere I went, every time I went in a public restroom, the entire time I was driving, non stop lol. I had a health scare and really wanted to try and be better. I used cigarettes to quit vaping because it was more inconvenient to have to go outside and they tasted so bad after vaping for years I hardly wanted them at first. After a week or so I threw the remainder out and have been cold turkey since then (10/6/24) but even today I get so pissed off about wanting to smoke or vape. When I wake up in the morning I'm like whats the point of having my breakfast and coffee with no reward after? Every meal I have, even a light snack, I'm raging inside when I remember I don't get a smoke after lol like its kind of ridiculous and I know its all mental now but does this ever end?

I’ve recently fallen in love with making my own lattes at work using our office espresso machine, and now I’m eager to bring the magic home. Luckily, my new job offers a $1000 bonus for setting up my home office, which includes coffee machines—so naturally, I’m using it for this!

I’m torn between three machines and would love your advice:

1. Breville Bambino Plus:
    - Pros: It has the auto-froth and temperature settings, which sound perfect for a beginner.
    - Cons: Its single-cup design seems limiting (can’t make two espressos side by side), and I’d need to buy a separate grinder, which adds to counter space.

2. Breville Barista Express Impress:
    - Pros: Love the aesthetics and the convenience of the built-in grinder.
    - Cons: Reviews suggest built-in grinders aren’t always great, and the lack of auto-frothing might make milk texturing a challenge for me.

3. Breville Barista Touch Impress (on sale for $1200):
    - Pros: It seems like the ultimate choice with an upgraded grinder, a touchscreen for recipes, and auto-froth settings.
    - Cons: The touchscreen makes me a bit wary of its durability, and it’s slightly over my $1000 budget.

My main priorities are ease of use (I’m still learning), the ability to create café-style lattes, and durability. Does anyone have experience with these machines? Or, should I consider other options entirely?

Any thoughts, tips, or guidance would be super helpful. Thanks in advance! 😊",0,1736792311.0,espresso,9,0.5,False

At the moment, 99 player signings have been announced, just a touch under 1/3 of the 300 Opening Day roster spots up for grabs.

Let's take a look at who's under contract:

**CHICAGO DOGS**

...\**crickets\**...

**Spin:** Yikes...On November 1, it was announced that Dogs manager Jeff Isom [was one-and-done](https://www.reddit.com/r/AAbaseball/comments/1ghb7hi/chicago_dogs_manager_jeff_isom_is_leaving_the/), opting to open a training facility in his hometown (Lafayette, IN). Over two months later, Chicago *still* does not have a manager. No manager=no players. A terrible start to say the absolute least. That doesn't mean they’ll lost 70 games like Gary did last year, but whoever (eventually) gets this job will have a *lot* of work to do and not a lot of time to do it.

**CLEBURNE RAILROADERS**

|**Player**|**2024 Team**|

|RHP [Johnathon Tripp](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=tripp-000jon)|**CLEBURNE**|

**Spin:** Good start so far. Clearly retaining top pitchers has been Pete Incaviglia's goal and so far, so good. Tripp and Boyd were good up front in the rotation and Scott was excellent out of the pen, while McDowell was alright. Lopez and Beebe both had good years in the Frontier League last year, so we'll see if they can handle the step up in competition. Brown and Taylor both mashed for quality D1 programs last year and I could see them both having strong rookie seasons. Lujano was great in Cleburne...but terrible in Chicago. If the 'Roaders get his Cleburne self again next year, he's their leadoff man. Brothers got way too many PAs (252) last year. He should be a backup.

**FARGO-MOORHEAD REDHAWKS**

||
||
|**Player**|**2024 Team**|
|RHP [Garrett Alexander](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=alexan003gar)|**FARGO-MOORHEAD**|

|INF [CJ Valdez](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=valdez000cj-)|**FARGO-MOORHEAD**/UTRGV (NCAA)|

**Spin:** Hmm. 5 of 6 signees are returners. Alexander has good stuff, but iffy command has always held him back. Kiser ate innings, but did little else of note. Hallquist, Brookshaw, and Valdez all had moments, but the latter two had rough second halves in their first pro seasons. Jandron is the wild card here. He was acquired in a trade from the Ottawa Titans in the Frontier League, where he was great in '22 and '24...but with Winnipeg in '23 was awful. Which version of him will F-M get?

**GARY SOUTHSHORE RAILCATS**

||

|**Player**|**2024 Team**|

|LHP [Grant Umberger](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=umberg000gra)|Mahoning Valley (MLBDL)/Toledo (NCAA)|

**Spin:** Clearly youth was a priority for Lamarr Rogers (who's still in charge, for whatever reason) as whatever they tried last year failed miserably. Acosta and Martinez are intriguing relief arms, while Umberger is definitely a rotation prospect. Radcliff has pop, but has *really* struggled to make contact as a pro, though he's reached as high as Double-A. Lopez had success in the Pioneer League, but has struggled outside the PBL. Allgeyer had a cup of coffee in the Frontier League last year and held his own. Really fits the Gary mold of athletic INF with no power but solid wheels. Diaz threw 104 innings last year...but had a 6.40 ERA. We'll see what the plan is.

**KANE COUNTY COUGARS**

||
||
|**Player**|**2024 Team**|
|INF [Josh Allen](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=allen-003jos)|**KANE COUNTY**|
|RHP [Logan Nissen](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=nissen000log)|**KANE COUNTY**|

**Spin:** Well, two players (both returners) is all so far for the defending champs, but not a bad two to start with. Allen is an Indy ball legend, Having played 11 Indy ball seasons (and only 42 games in affiliated ball) in his career, including seven in the AA. After retiring three games into 2022, he came back in '23, has had two nice seasons in a row and at 33 had maybe his best season last year. He'll be hitting in the middle of the order. Nissen has had three excellent years out of the Cougars pen and his about as dependable as relievers come in the AA. As for everyone else...well George Tsamis is a notorious procrastinator, so it'll come together...eventually.

**KANSAS CITY MONARCHS**

|**Player**|**2024 Team**|

|INF [Rixon Wingrove](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=wingro000rix)|Long Island (AtL)/Ft. Myers (A)/Cedar Rapids (A+)|

**Spin:** Only two returners of seven signees, though Bissonette was a very dependable shortstop and Hakanson shined out of the bullpen in a late-season stint. Glendenning and Wingrove both have shown big-time pop in affiliated ball, while Costes showed power in college but has struggled to unlock it as a pro. Maybe here? Sandoval is an interesting piece behind the plate, while Gonzalez seems to profile as a backup infielder based on his lackluster track record. I wouldn't be shocked if he's gone quickly.

|OF [Ray Zuberer II](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=zubere000ray)|**LAKE COUNTRY**|

**Spin:** The Hounds were *busy*, with 14 players already signed, second-most in the league. Eight are returners, though four of them are playing their first full pro seasons (as are five more guys from outside the AA). Most of the guys with pro experience held their own, even coming right out of college. I'm especially interested in Clark and Benson. Nix is a former MLB and NPB hurler, though he didn't play in '24. Fenlong was released despite pitching well in affiliated ball last year. Conine was a solid start for the Hounds last year, while Mullenbach was a dependable reliever the last two years. Pilot had his moments after coming over midseason from Fargo. Zuberer is maybe the gem of this group, after having an awesome 2/3 of a season for LC last season. I like how this group is coming together so far.

**LINCOLN SALTDOGS**

|RHP [Zach Murray](https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=murray004zac)|Williamsport (MLBDL)/Young Harris (NCAA)|

**Spin:** Lincoln needs a lot of help and they’ve re-signed a couple decent infielders who are their only returners among seven signees, but neither one are guys that move the needle. After dipping heavily into the Pioneer League well with “meh” results last year, they’ve gone that way again for Landis and Cone. Fahr has high-OBP potential in the infield but otherwise is similar to Hewitt and Dragum. Everitt had some college success, so maybe there’s something there. Murray is a rotation candidate who ate a lot of innings in the MLB Draft League last year.

**Spin:** The Milkmen already have a league-high 16 players signed, most notable All-Star Erik Ostberg and former big-leaguer Jaylin Davis. Bartow returns after being very good for the Milkmen in 2022-23. 6 of their 8 returners (9 including Bartow) were mid-season acquisitions, including Escala, who was excellent after being released after the Frontier League, and Doersching, who was great in a small sample size last year and is a 20+ homer threat. Denner was one of the best arms in the MLBDL last year and seems ticketed for the back end of the bullpen. Mendez had a sub-4.00 ERA in the Pioneer League (a legitimate accomplishment) and is a rotation candidate.

**Spin:** Three returners come back out of nine total signees, with two of them entering their first full season. It’s interesting how three outfielders have already signed, which is unusual. George was excellent the last two years in the Pioneer League, and his teammate Jessee was an innings eater who missed some bats. He could realistically be either a starter or reliever. Pozo had intriguing numbers in the very low minors. Byrne is another PBL guy. Corona is a first-year pro who had some solid college numbers. Vooletich played all last year with the X’s, but was unimpressive. He may be a fourth OF this year.

**Spin:** Sioux Falls has taken huge steps the last two years and this is a great start towards keeping that momentum. Barth and Achenbach are both multi-year anchors and Rehwaldt is an MVP candidate. Ordonez had been a solid piece in the AA the last two years. Miller and Brown were both very good rotation pieces last year and Stover is a proven AA bullpen arm. Catcher was a black hole for the Birds last year and Dirksen hit for big-time pop in college, being the latest Canarie out of the Augustana pipeline that has served Sioux Falls well (Barth, Brown, and Miller are all Augie grads).

**Spin:** Sioux Falls had an impressive group, but the 2024 runner-ups have an even deeper collection re-signed. The Goldeyes have 12 players signed (and a league-high 10 returners) and this is definitely the most experienced group, with multi-year AA guys like Alexander, Arroyo, Bourassa, Lambson, and of course, future AA Hall of Famer Max Murphy, who’s back for his fifth year in Winnipeg (and eighth in the league). Lambson is a wild card who’s had a lot of success in a lot of places, who surprisingly showed up late last year after not pitching in the AA since 2020. How much does he have left at 34? Strobel, Yakel, and Kasowski are good bullpen pieces. Bramasco was very nice last year and Guenther has Pioneer and Frontier League success, but this is his first crack at the AA. O’Tremba got cut out of affiliated ball last year, but had a good ’23. Turner is a true unknown, with only four pro games out of an NAIA school. He’s the odd duck of the group.

1i0kgzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DerryMaine/comments/1i0kgzc/american_hygge/,American HYGGE,"In Scandinavian countries, there’s the concept of *hygge*, which has many interpretations but generally revolves around the idea of a cozy and comfortable life. Now let’s try to come up with a similar word that captures the following:

1. **The American countryside**, ideally nestled in forests.
2. **A vibe of the 80s**, though this can be used as a seasoning rather than the main flavor.
3. **Almost always rainy or overcast weather**.
4. **Wooden interiors**, where an ATARI neon poster hangs above a Nintendo console, a moose head adorns the wall, and there’s always a fireside.
5. **Rock music from the 70s and 80s**, occasionally sprinkled with country tunes.
6. A **1980 Ford Bronco** parked beneath the window.
7. **Friends who tell creepy stories** about the city.
8. The faint smell of **coffee and pine**, mixing with damp earth and fresh rain.
9. A **stack of old VHS tapes** sitting by a TV, ready for a nostalgic movie night.
10. A **creaky wooden porch** with a rocking chair, where someone strums a guitar while the rain taps on the roof.
11. A **dog curled up by the fireplace**, the perfect companion on a stormy evening.
12. The occasional sound of an **owl hooting** or wolves howling in the distance, adding a subtle sense of mystery.
13. **Warm flannel blankets** draped over a couch, waiting for a lazy evening by the fire.
14. **Polaroid photos** pinned to the wall, capturing moments of friends, road trips, and misty landscapes.
15. A **quiet sense of isolation**, yet the feeling of being exactly where you belong.",1,1736792140.0,DerryMaine,0,1.0,False

It seems they’ve had the position open since September as they’re being more selective, I’m okay with that. They asked for me to do a virtual meeting with them, which I suggested coffee in person as I was local. We went from virtual to in-person, which I was thrilled about. 

I attending the interview where the gentleman who interviewed me grabbed his boss after 30ish minutes together. I wasn’t expecting another person to come in as it wasn’t told ahead of time, so I didn’t do research on them. It went well though and afterwards we took a tour of the college. 

I got home, did some stuff and was about to start a thank you email when I got the email they wanted to do a full day experience with me. I was thrilled! I got the itinerary and everything and it turns out it’s a 1/2 day experience. Totally cool. 

I’ve done some research into each of the people that I’ll be meeting with across the campus as well as programs and offerings of the college. Is there anything I should include or should I limit my questions? Anyone else with a similar situation?",1,1736792110.0,jobsearch,0,1.0,False

I start work very early in the morning.  When I wake up I feed my cat, drink some coffee and get ready for work.  My sleep score is generally great on the weekdays.

My issue is with the weekends.  I often stay up extra late on days I do not work the next day but my cat wakes me up at the usual time.. okay.. my problem not the apps fault but hear me out:  by the time i go to the kitchen and feed the cat, I feel awake and start some laundry and get some things done.  I sleep/nap for a couple hours around noon to get enough sleep.  The problem is that I then get 2 very low scores which destroy my 30 day average.

My suggestion is that if my nighttime sleep+nap was cumulative.. like count the time i was up in the morning as a large ""bed exit"".  This way I'd have sufficient ""restful sleep"" and my 30 day average would be more accurate.  ",1,1736792084.0,sleepnumber,2,1.0,False

GPA:4.0 student 
Major: finance 

So I recently used a friend’s tip to go grab coffee with someone in upper management/ a role you are looking up to. 

I went alone though, not because I’m anti-social but because I don’t hang out in “coffee” type of environments. I soon realized it’s normal to take someone out for coffee and chat. I even had people come talk to me. 

I wanted to know more tips like; 
Are there specific coffee shops that are better? 
Good questions to ask?
How do I make myself sound/look, impressed/intrigued ? 
Any tip on socializing and networking would be appreciated ",1,1736792003.0,financestudents,0,1.0,False
