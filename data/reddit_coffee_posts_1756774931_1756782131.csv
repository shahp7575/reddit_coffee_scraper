1n68gt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMeSmile/comments/1n68gt7/i_surprised_my_dad_this_morning/,I surprised my dad this morning.,"My family all speak completely native English, but we all know a bit of German. My dad, however, knows fluent German and can speak a total of eight languages. He uses Duolingo for Russian and Irish, and lately I've picked Duolingo up again for Irish (I have German and Russian sitting, neglected in the back of my profile). He's got a ridiculously high amount of XP on both Russian and Irish, so he knows a lot of both. I haven't told my parents that I'm doing Irish specifically, but they have gotten the notifications of 'Kitty increased their Duolingo score to 5!' and so on. I was up late last night and talking to my mom (it was three AM and neither of us could sleep), and I told her that I wanted to surprise my dad in the morning by saying something to him in Irish.

  
The next morning, I was up early enough that my dad was just walking into the kitchen to make his morning coffee.

  
My words were 'Dia duit! Caife le bainne agus siúcra, le de thoil.' (Hello! Coffee with milk and sugar, please!)

  
He was absolutely delighted. It was so fun to see. He made me a cup of coffee. My dad knows that I don't necessarily love the taste of coffee itself, but that I love caffeine (and I only got around three hours of sleep, so I needed some that morning), so he made it mostly milk, and put some sugar in it. It was yummy. I had a good morning, to say the least.",1,1756781944.0,MakeMeSmile,0,1.0,False

We like to leave binoculars there for our guests to watch the birds and wildlife. We leave them right on the coffee table and noticed while cleaning today that they were gone. This is the second pair that have been stolen. The problem is we don't remember until a few cleans have happened so we don't know who to blame. We have great guests and always feel like they understand and our very appreciative of our tiny house and the work we put in ...so it feels violating when this happens.

1n68ceh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1n68ceh/my_brothers_a_selfish_asshole_just_looking_to/,"My brother's a selfish asshole (just looking to vent, not for advice)","I \[23M\] have been living with my brother \[30M\] and his fiancée for the past few months. I just graduated college and I'm looking for a job, but I'll be moving back to my college town in about a week for unrelated reasons, and I regret not standing up for myself hardly at all this summer because I feel like it's too late not. Please don't get me wrong, I'm incredibly thankful for him giving me a place to stay and for so long, but when his own fiancée who's barely known me is consistently treating me way better than he is even though he's known me for almost his entire life (and obviously all of mine) I just can't help but feel repeatedly hurt.

For example, this morning his fiancée made coffee and it smelled really good, so I went to their home office where both of them were (they're doctors and they were studying for board exams) and asked if I could try some of her coffee. She was wearing headphones, but instead of tapping her on the shoulder or something and being like ""hey, Guava wants to know if he can try some of your coffee,"" he just responded for her in this really annoyed tone and said ""you can have a sip. She's studying for her board exams though so you can just have a sip."" Now, I was referring to the coffee *grounds* and I felt like that would have been obvious to her (he doesn't drink coffee) because *obviously* I'm not gonna drink straight from her pot (he kindly dusted off an old coffee maker they had in the garage at the start of the summer for me so we'd never be confused about whose coffee was whose, but now that I think about it I think this just goes back to his whole hatred of sharing thing that I'll expand upon in a minute), but this really bothered me because literally she is her own person and can respond for herself, not to mention I have shared my own grounds with her once and thought nothing of it.

I'm personally very much of the ""I'll get you this time and you can get me another time"" mentality but can accept it if a roommate wants to split everything perfectly down the middle with receipts and everything (though with some annoyance), but with friends that is just crossing a line for me and for family that's just fucking disrespectful as hell, but he doesn't even do that, he'd rather there be two of everything, one for him and his fiancée and one for me. At first I just put up with it because I was like okay whatever his house his rules but with how often I've shared my own things with them just for him (and ONLY him, because again, she treats me way better even though we're practically strangers) to never reciprocate just feels like a huge slap in the face. I'm vegan and they're not and while I have absolutely zero expectation of them to cook vegan food just so they can share it with me, I really don't think I'm entitled for expecting them to share things like sriracha and tea, especially when I've bought all the refills on kitchen supplies like salt, cooking oil, and paper towels. I also had this sneaking suspicion that he was upset with me for using these things, and hopefully by buying them I assuaged some of that, but I always feel like it's always the wrong time to bring things up with him if that makes any sense because I feel like I'm constantly walking on eggshells around him with how easily he gets annoyed with me. This suspicion isn't unfounded either, I remember one day I offered to mix three drinks (one beer, a can of soda, and a can of flavored sparkling water) for the three of us, and he told me that all the sparkling waters and sodas were ""respectfully"" theirs and that'd like me to stop grabbing them, even though I was also buying drinks for the fridge that they would never take, presumably out of trying to be respectful in his view, but when he's also doing shit like making a fresh pot of rice the day after I did instead of asking if he could have some of mine (which I don't think he should even have to ask! it's literally rice it takes like three seconds to make), it comes off less as him trying to be respectful and more as him trying to make me be a stranger. I literally share shit like this with roommates I didn't know before being their roommate and who I didn't even always have positive opinions of; how the fuck are you gonna treat me more distantly than someone I don't even like??

I really want to reiterate that I never feel like I can bring anything up to him. While part of this is definitely my fault for not just ripping the bandaid off and seeing how it goes, when we were growing up together he would always yell at me when I wanted attention from him like playing a video game together and he would constantly get mad at me over the tiniest of things which really wrecked my self esteem since I was literally in elementary school getting constantly yelled at by someone who's way bigger than me and who I just wanted love from, and I mention this not because I'm still stuck in the past but because the pattern hasn't changed, the only thing that's different now is instead of him going off on me he'll become incredibly passive-aggressive and develop this really rude tone. Like, there are times where the two of them are just silently studying, or (because of the nature of their disciplines she has to study more than he does) she'll be studying while watching him play a video game, and I'll ask if I can sit with them while I apply for jobs, and sometimes he'll say (I'm now realizing it's always him who decides) sure, and other times he'll be like ""I mean *I guess*...."" and like I get that you're living with your fiancée and sometimes want to spend time with her alone, but if that's what is I'd prefer you just honestly tell me ""not right now, sorry, I want to just be with her right now"" instead of treating me like I'm not literally family. They invited me to spend time with them a couple times at the start of the summer but then that quickly stopped and I don't know why. I just don't get it. He's always happy to see me and likes talking to me when I'm in the kitchen or dining room or living room, but then whenever it comes to me approaching him instead of the other way around it's a 50-50 change he gets needlessly pissy with me.

And again, his fiancée never treats me like this! She's an extremely kindhearted person and frankly more emotionally intelligent than he is, and while I don't know all the details of their relationship I can tell she's aware of this from the things she'll say to him when he's worked up or when he's treating me with passive aggression in front of her (today was an exception since she had headphones in). I could go on and on but it just really fucking sucks, I've been making excuses for him to myself all my life but I honestly can't anymore seeing just how much better I'm being treated by her. It just really hurts...

Edit: I just wanted to add that we didn't grow up rich so I really have no idea where this comes from. Our parents are considerably better off (ie. middle class) now than they used to be and so they're able to give me money for groceries, minimum credit card payments, and some small treats for myself, but growing up our parents would constantly fight over how they would pay the bills and shit was just never working properly in our house so he is by absolutely no means a stranger to having to share. Maybe he hates it so much because we were forced into it by our economic situation?? And now that he's making more money as a doctor he doesn't want to go back to it? I seriously don't know but I also don't think it's this, this is honestly a pretty shitty guess but it's also all that i have to go off of :/",2,1756781561.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

It wasn’t a life-changing sum, but it felt massive. Proof that all the effort, doubt, and coffee-fuelled persistence actually turned into something real. Someone out there bought my book, read my words, and valued them enough to make this moment possible.

I wrote *Tow Like A Girl* to help Aussie women feel confident towing caravans, because the info out there was either jargon-heavy, condescending, or written like it was only meant for blokes. Seeing it go from an idea in my head to a published book, and now to actual royalties, is surreal.

1n68994,https://www.reddit.com/r/velabasstuff/comments/1n68994/my_roommate_found_a_new_pair_of_shoes_by_the/,My roommate found a new pair of shoes by the dumpster. We should have never put them on,"When guests visited our apartment, they always commented on the smell—something old, almost medicinal. We blamed the building’s age, and after removing their shoes to come in, they’d eventually stop noticing it. Three years later and I still smell it. Reminds me of hospitals from my childhood.

My roommate Paul had the bigger room because he was here first, and I had responded to an ad online to rent the other. Kitchen, common area where we had the TV and our gaming consoles, dining nook, and a covered patio. Paul and I got along even though we came from different worlds. His was one that required a lot of posturing with friends and being perpetually online. Mine was maybe lonelier.

Somehow, we clicked, and after our respective workdays we often found ourselves collaborating on meals and playing games late. I liked RPGs; he preferred co-op shooters which I joined reluctantly because he got frustrated, yelled, and gave me side-eye whenever I suggested staying calm. He blamed his thick fingers.

From our apartment you could look down at a parking lot where every Tuesday garbage trucks made their rounds at 7 a.m. to the chagrin of tenants whose bedrooms faced that way, like mine.

I feel like these are important details. I’m describing my life as it has been for a while. It’s where I live, and it’s where I am now. It’s the mundane little facts that I need to tell you, so that they serve as counterweights to the hefty truth I’m about to unload, in search of sober advice. I just need to tell it so that you can understand. You won’t understand, but I’ve got to at least try.

“Olly, check it out!” I remember Paul said. I slurped some cheerios messily and looked up from my phone.

“What up?” I said.

“Those look new.”

I lazily pulled myself up and looked out the window.

“Huh? What, where?”

“Those shoes. I’m gonna go get them.”

Paul rushed out and soon emerged in the parking lot. I watched him step gingerly in his moccasins to the dumpster, and scoop up the pair of bright white sneakers, grinning up at me as he scurried back.

The door slammed. I pressed into my lower back to stretch as Paul came in. He proudly displayed the pair of shoes in one hand and snapped with the other.

“Tight!”

“They don’t stink,” I said.

The shoes were completely white, and despite sitting by a dumpster were impeccably clean.

“Smell like roses, these,” he said.

“Well, will they fit?”

“Size 11 baby!” he confirmed.

“Nice coincidence.”

Now we’ve come to the part of the story I can’t really expect you to believe. I wouldn’t. In my family we’ve seen tragedy. My younger brother was born with a disease that meant lots of operations before he could even walk. Hospitals became second homes; iodine soap a familiar salve; plastic-wrapped food and peel-back tin capped juice in those milky plastic containers a family meal. I accompanied my parents every time they went, and each time was like sucking the color out of dreams, the whimsy out of imagination. I didn’t grow up all at once, but my childhood was not child friendly. I learned that life was limited, solutions pragmatic and usually muted and smelly.

“Lemme try ‘em on,” said Paul.

He sat on the couch, pulled off his moccasins, put on the right shoe, then the left. And disappeared.

As soon as he put those shoes on, he was gone. Gone not in any sense that is common. I mean gone without any real-world indication that he was there before. Gone without any vision, nor any sound that would signal his disappearing. He was there, then he wasn’t, as if his existence simply ceased.

I watched the couch cushion slowly reform itself where Paul had been sitting. I was still standing, but I had moved back up against the wall and my palms were pressed against it as if expecting the room to suddenly fall away or for gravity’s pull to shift 90 degrees.

What felt like eternity was only a minute, and then Paul was back, sitting on the couch, panting, one of the new shoes in his hand. He looked around like a stranger before finding my eyes and locking on, making me feel like prey.

“Fuck!” I yelled.

“Fuck,” he whispered. He slowly regained control of his breathing and then yelled, wide-eyed at me. “Fuck! Olly!”

“What!” I screamed back, shaking. “What!”

Blood rushed back into his face as his complexion softened, and his eyes narrowed.

“Bro,” he said. “You won’t believe it.”

I didn’t believe it. He told me that he was in a forest. He said it was hot and humid, and the noises of insects, birds and dripping rain were as vivid as anything here. He struggled to recall things at first because of the shock, but as we calmed down, he told me he had truly been there, in the rainforest, standing on moist black dirt and looking up at sunlight piercing canopy. He said it smelled ‘exquisite’, a word that was out of character for him.

“You’re saying you were in the Amazon?” I said finally.

“No idea bro,” he said. “Amazon maybe. I don’t know.”

“Maybe Borneo?”

“I don’t know. The rainforest man. The deadass rainforest.”

“Alright,” I said.

By now he had taken off the other shoe and the pair was just sitting there in front of us on the rug.

Paul eyed me. Looked at the shoes.

“Yup,” he said. “You gotta.”

“The hell I do,” I countered.

“You gotta.”

He grimaced, reading my face, I guess.

“You wanna, Olly. You wanna, trust me.”

I did. I felt calm enough to know that I did. I had to try this. They’d fit my size 10 feet.

I bent down and grabbed one, slipped it on my socked foot. Grabbed the other, and held there, staring at Paul.

“What should I—you know,” I prompted.

“Fuck, right, dude. Listen. Just take the shoe off, it’s what I did, and pow, I’m back. Just take off the shoes.”

This was our exchange before I put the other shoe on, and the apartment was immediately gone. No cues, no noise or visual of transition. Just there, and now here. Where was I? It wasn’t a forest like Paul; it was a field. I felt the sun on my skin. Hills in the distance, and a highway? A semi-truck rumbling past. Buildings in the distance.

I bent down and tore off a shoe, and was suddenly back in the apartment facing a roommate whose body language bounced with intrigue.

“Dude!” he yelled. “You just vanished!”

“My God,” I said. “Jesus Christ.”

He was nodding with his whole head and neck, as if vibing. Wide-eyed, unblinking.

“Sick, right? The rainforest—”

“—not a forest,” I said. “More like a prairie, I guess? But there was a road, a big truck. Buildings too.”

“No shit. I’d’ve checked out those buildings,” he said a bit curtly.

“Yeah but I came back before I could really get my bearings. It was crazy.”

“Crazy,” he repeated. “Crazy.”

We both looked at the shoe I held.

So, this is the secret. Magical shoes that transported us. Not unheard of in fiction but I am telling you that this happened to us. Paul went to a forest. I went to a prairie. We found a pair of shoes in the trash and put them on and were teleported to these destinations instantaneously.

It didn’t stop there. It couldn’t. Would you have stopped? Paul went again. When he came back, he told me he was on a hill overlooking a valley and could see a whole city that he didn’t recognize. I went again and found myself on a grey sand beach with a cold wind. We went a few more times like this. Once, I found myself on a snowy mountain, and when I reappeared in our apartment Paul said I was cold to the touch. There was even snow in my hair. Then Paul went again, and the asshole was gone for five whole minutes. When he returned, I was surprised to see him cradling about 10 mangos.

“What the hell?” I said.

“A mango orchard man, a bleeping orchard fer real!”

“Are they ripe?”

We took a break from teleportation over slices of fresh mango. We discussed our experience and decided that the destinations were random. We knew it didn’t matter if we walked around, that we always returned to the apartment. We knew there were cities, so we knew there were people. It was clearly Earth so whatever magic this was, it was here. But when was it? Had either of us seen anything out of whack for 2025? No, we hadn’t. Still no people.

“Maybe we should stop,” I remember saying. “Give it a rest maybe.”

Neither of us wanted to do that. We had the whole day still.

We took turns teleporting, and we learned more. We started to figure that eventually we should land in cities. A few times we each landed within sight of populations, but since we had agreed to a one-minute limit after Paul’s five-minute disappearance, we couldn’t yet reach those places. Paul begrudged the rule. We also figured that if we hadn’t landed in towns or cities yet, it was only because most of the globe is still just wild land, farms, or water.

Bad timing, to jinx ourselves like that.

I pulled on the second shoe and at once lost my senses. Not that I couldn’t feel, because the shock of cold was devastating and I gasped. Not that I couldn’t taste because when I gasped, I lost my breath as my mouth filled with icy salt water. Not that I couldn’t see but it was black night and then plunging darkness. Not that I couldn’t hear but it was shrieking wind and then warbled frigid water in ghostly depths that seemed to tear me in different directions.

I struggled, panic filled. Reach. But swim, swim! I thought. Must breathe, I knew, but I could escape this. I reached, and just as my lungs began to inhale, my frozen knuckles locked their fingers around a shoe and tugged it off.

Suddenly I was in the apartment on all fours heaving and vomiting saltwater over our rug. Shivering miserably, drenched completely. I felt Paul hitting my back. My ears were ringing, adjusting to the sudden warmth.

Paul brought water. Patted my back.

“I was,” I said. My voice sounded like gravel. “I was in the ocean, I think.”

Paul just stared, nodded. He was amazed and still I sensed, jealous?

Later I sat in my robe wrapped in towels before a humming space heater. I told him about the storm, the night. We had already experienced nighttime in the couple hours we had been at this adventure. I told him about the crashing waves that I couldn’t escape.

“We have to be more careful,” I said.

That had been enough for one day.

We agreed the shoes would stay in the living room, that we would only use them together. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it. Unbelieving, but convinced. We planned. From now on we had an entry position. We’d sit in cannonball position, but one leg crossing the other. Both hands would grasp the second shoe as we put it on, so that we’d already be prepared to yank it off in case of trouble. We considered other things like wearing a wetsuit and flippers, goggles, even an oxygen tank, given how likely it should be that we’d land in an ocean somewhere. But ultimately, we decided to buy a large plastic sheet from Home Depot and lay it out on the living room floor to catch water, and to purchase a simple lifejacket that wouldn’t hinder movement when teleporting plopped us on dry land.

I barely slept that night. As frightening as they were, these shoes changed my life. I was jittery with excitement, suppressing fear.

We both called in sick next morning. Of course we did.

Then we got into Paul’s car and went on our errands. Only took an hour.

Back at the apartment, we laid our new plastic sheet where the rug had been. Rug was hung to dry out on the patio. The life jacket was a small sea kayaker’s jacket. Stylish and minimal. We had also bought a small knife, some beef jerky, a headlamp, a length of high-strength static line, and bug spray. The jacket had pockets for these things.

We also decided to pack my phone in the jacket. It had a better waterproof rating than Paul’s, and my international roaming plan was less ghastly expensive than his, if we ever landed somewhere with signal. We wanted to take photos and videos. But mostly it was to set the timer, as we’d agreed to increase the time to five minutes. Later we’d increase it to ten minutes.

We shared a large breakfast of hashbrowns, egg sausage sandwiches and dark coffee. Then the adventure began.

As the morning progressed, an area of our living room began to look like a naturopath’s collection. On each trip, we’d bring something back. A rock. A branch. A flower or bundle of grass. Dirt, or sometimes trash. It was shocking how rarely we landed close to people yet how often we found trash. It became clear that we were hitting places all over the world. Wrappers with Chinese lettering, a grocery bag with Tamil (the phone translation app said), French, other languages we’d yet to identify.

On one trip Paul was gone over five minutes. I began to worry. His phone rang and I picked it up. ‘Olly’, it read. I accepted.

“Paul?” I said, haltingly.

“Brooooo!” I heard him yell. It was a perfectly clear call.

“Paul!” I exclaimed. I stood and paced. “Paul where are you?”

“I’m not sure but I got bars bro! So, I’m callin’.”

“Any landmark? What’s the climate?”

“Pretty dry. I think I’m in a desert, but there are power lines I see. I guess a cell tower’s close so.”

My hand was in my hair, as if calming my mind.

“Clear skies,” he said.

“Maybe you’re stateside somewhere? Southwest? Take a photo, we can reverse image search back here again. Or wait just open the map app, I downloaded a ton of regions last night.”

“Hold on.”

I waited a few seconds.

“No dice, no internet just calling. GPS shows I’m nowhere,” he said.

“Damn.”

“Yeah. Hey, Olly?”

“What’s up?”

Just then he appeared almost exactly where I was pacing and I bumped into him, knocking us both to the plastic-covered ground. We laughed maniacally.

When we calmed, he showed me some photos he’d taken.

“GeoGuessr eat your heart out,” I said.

“Huh?”

“You know, that Google Maps street view game? It shows you a street view somewhere on the planet and you guess where it is by dropping a pin on a map. Whoever’s closest wins. I played with colleagues a few times.”

“That’s an idea,” said Paul.

We created a map, named it ‘Jumping Jimmies.’ Then we did a reverse image search on one of the pictures that Paul had taken with my phone. While it wasn’t conclusive it gave us some lookalikes.

“Could be that one. ‘Red Sand’, in Saudi.”

“Mmm,” I said. “But look at that rock, a bit too unique. You woulda seen that. This one? Devil’s Desert?”

“Not sandy enough.”

“Namibia? No.”

“Wait, that one!” Paul exclaimed. “What’s that?”

“Oh yeah that looks good. Says ‘Atacama, Chile’.”

“Yes! That’s it I’m sure of it! Mark it.”

We chose a series of icons that we labeled by the percentage of how sure we were of each location. \~90% on the Atacama Desert, green circle.

Elation welled up in my heart. I had always loved to travel and now I was traveling the world incognito. Paul and I were prepared, ready, and eager. We thought we anticipated everything. If only we’d kept our guard up…

 

By evening many colorful icons dotted our map. We had taken dozens of photos, one of Paul’s toothy smile beside a grinning shepherd on a mountain road somewhere in Kyrgyzstan, another of a group of people at a bus stop in a Colombian town (Paul envied how often I landed with people).

“Yeah, you always get the good places,” Paul said. “I just get trees and hills. Every single time.”

Puddles pooled on the plastic tarp in our living room from a handful of times we found ourselves swimming. Paul wanted to visit a city, but I wasn’t ready to increase our time limit enough to walk to one or to board a bus like in Colombia. We had to take it slowly, and I knew that if Paul would be patient we’d land in one.

But then it finally happened.

Tokyo is the largest city on Earth, with a population over 30 million. Fitting then that it was the first big city we happened upon, or that I happened upon. I had learned to reign in my expectations when slipping on the second shoe. In less than an instant I was teleported onto a narrow road, remarkably carless and calm, staring up at skyscrapers glinting in sunlight. I recognized Japanese on the shopfront, and English accompanying all the street signs. In fact, I’d been to Tokyo before, and so the sight was familiar. The sight of me, however, less so. At least to a curious couple ogling me. I realized a foreigner in the middle of a Tokyo street wearing a lifejacket packed with survival items and awkwardly sat hugging his knees and grabbing a shoe would look bizarre.

I scampered to my feet and out of the way of a stout little delivery van driving past. I smiled at the couple who continued walking. I retrieved my cell phone; 09 minutes 04 seconds left before I should remove a shoe.

Something immediately caught my attention—the sweet scent of tempura frying. I located its source: a small restaurant with ubiquitous noren fabric hanging to mark its entryway. I was in Tokyo. I loved Japanese food, loved it absolutely. Here I was! I had to, right? We couldn’t control where we landed, so who knows when I’d happen upon Japan, and Tokyo itself, again? I found my hands searching my chest as I realized I had no money. We should’ve been traveling with credit cards at least. But they pay with cash here mostly. Impractical to travel with every currency, though, and impractical to expect a currency exchange.

Then it dawned on me, to my shame and to my joy, that I could dine and dash without so much as a step to flee.

Parted the noren to enter. Konnichiwa, hello. I sat at the bar in the narrow locale, removing my lifejacket ashamedly and hanging it on a hook underneath. I ordered the tendon by pointing. The aroma, the delectable crispy vegetables and shrimp, beautifully crisp, and umami flavors.

As if waking from a dream I remembered Paul and quickly checked the time. I was already ten minutes overdue! With averted eyes and utter embarrassment and shame for what they’d think, I snatched my lifejacket and ducked under the bar. Removed a shoe.

“Son of a bitch!” yelled Paul. “Where the fuck were you? I was freaking out man. We said ten minutes!” He sniffed. “What’s that smell?”

I begged his forgiveness and placed my hands on his shoulders, urging him onto the couch. Calm, calm.

“It’s toasted sesame,” I said. “I was in Tokyo. I ate tempura.”

“Tempura? That fried stuff they serve with sushi?”

“Sure, yeah.”

“Did you say... Tokyo? A city? You ate in a city!?” he yelled, smiling.

“Damn right,” I said.

“Jumpin’ jimmies!” he yelled, and I repeated that refrain reflexively. “Mark it down! A city, you lucky bastard. Lowkey smells insane. You lucky, lucky asshole. And you didn’t bring any back.”

“Damn it!” I said. “I’m sorry Paul, I didn’t think about it. When I saw the time—”

“—Yeah. All good. Man, I want to land in a city.”

Paul’s eyes were on the lifejacket, but not really. They were distant, imaginative. I couldn’t tell if he was more happy or more envious -- long stares are tough to decipher.

“You’ll get there man, I promise. We’ll get you there.”

For a moment annoyance crossed his expression, but it didn’t linger long enough for comment.

“Yeah,” he said plainly.

We jumped a few more times and then Paul said he wanted to take a break. Envious, it turned out. He was sulking. Disappeared into his room without too many words between us. I figured he’d just have to let it settle, and we’d be back at it in the evening.

I fixed myself a sandwich and ate it while observing our disorderly living room. Souvenirs, laptops, wet plastic. Then I retired to my own room, surprised to feel tired. I think the jumps take it out of you.

I sank into willful sleep.

 

When next I woke it was dark outside. I’d slept the whole afternoon. Clock read 9 p.m.

Out in the living room everything looked the same. Paul’s door was shut. My mouth felt dry and so I poured a glass of water and leaned on the counter, marveling at our mess again.

Then I saw.

The shoes were gone.

I set the glass down, and skipped to Paul’s door, knocked.

“Paul? You awake?” I opened it. “Paul?” Not there.

As I rushed back into the living room and started upending cushions in search of the shoes, it was like watching an actor in a movie you’ve already seen. I knew he’d taken them. I knew he jumped.

The lifejacket was on the floor. I retrieved my phone from a pouch. “Idiot,” I thought. “You left it.”

No missed calls, no texts. I called Paul’s phone and heard it ringing in his room. “Idiot,” I said to myself more sharply.

How long had he been gone? I looked for any new artifacts, any notes or new pins on our Google map. Nothing. I checked the tarp, which was mostly dry now. His car was still parked outside. I opened our front door and stuck my head out. Hallway was clear.

“This sonofabitch straight up donned the shoes and peaced,” I said aloud.

In anger I sounded more like Paul than myself. Oppressive silence seemed to coalesce. It was a bit more humid than normal—all the extra salt water. Suddenly our pile of artifacts and souvenirs seemed nasty, so I grabbed a garbage bag and shoved everything in, tied it off. I was helpless.

Hours went by. It was 3 a.m. by the time I felt tired again. My eyes stung. I drank some water and retreated to my bed where I finally let myself pass out.

 

Beep-beep-beep.

Groggy and petrified I calmed myself when I realized I was just waking up. The garbage truck upturned the dumpster, its metal arms clanging as it guzzled trash and then replaced the container, drove off. I fell out of bed. 7 a.m.

Out in the living room the scene was unchanged. No Paul. He had been gone for over 12 hours.

I cooked runny oatmeal, added raisins and slurped it. Could he have drowned? Didn’t take the lifejacket, the buffoon. Real possibility. Maybe he landed in Vegas and would pop back home to regale me with some story worthy of The Hangover. Wild animal could’ve attacked him, but I struggled to imagine he wouldn’t have the time to remove a shoe. Maybe he’s just on a hike. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten that tempura. I like Paul but I knew he was quick to jealousy. Why didn’t I smooth things over? It would’ve taken five minutes max. Paul’s ego wanted, needed to be coaxed. Two days and already we’re at each other’s throats? No that can’t be it. A misunderstanding maybe. He’s just off to prove a point. Don’t fuck with the rules, Olly, he’ll tell me. Tell yourself, man. Leaving precautions behind, no phone even. God damn it.

I was chewing on a raisin, the wet oatmeal juice resting in my mouth awaiting to be swallowed. I was staring at the plastic sheet on our living room floor. One moment that’s all I was doing; the next I was staring at a body.

Face-down. Shirtless. Holes in his back, blood pooling, some dripping down the torso. White shorts, pockets outturned, stained. One white shoe, stained. The other foot bare and dirty. Thick fingers, bent and broken on one hand. The way jumping works, it makes it seem that this body had been there for as long as I had been looking at that spot, that I’d been staring at it while I slurped cooling oatmeal. That I should feel guilty for only plunging into nightmare after the body appeared and not before.

Paul. Paul’s body. His hair, his broken hands. The smell. My mind recalled images of hospitals and gowns with geometric prints, hands scrubbing harsh brown bars of soap with foam that smelled medicinal and metallic and burnt. The smell of memory competed with the smell of death, one trying to sanitize the other because it cannot be. It can’t. He can’t be dead.

Oatmeal dribbled down my chin before I could close my mouth. It suddenly tasted like raw meat, and I spat into the sink. I became aware of my pounding heart playing catch-up. All my senses were delayed, as if reality could not so abruptly be changed, so noiselessly debased to this horror.

Each sniff triggered a gag. Each blink felt eternal. Give it enough time to just erase this. Blink it out of existence, I know it can be done. Please, please, please.

I write this anonymously. My name’s not Olly and his is not Paul. But I need help. There is a body, shot to death, laying on a plastic tarp in my living room. There’s only one shoe the other is gone. No one will believe me. What do I do?",1,1756781291.0,velabasstuff,0,1.0,False

I've been making coffee as espresso, drip filter and plunger for many years now and decided to give an aeropress a whirl ... however I am not sure if I'm doing something wrong or if I have a bum unit.

  
The unit is leaking grounds badly \*before\* I even press and I noticed that the filter paper is not being gripped at all by the ""filter cap"". When I look at the base of the tube it seems that there is a fine (perhaps 1mm) raised edge which I assume is to bite down onto the filter paper (but I don't know) ... however not only is not not biting down onto the filter at all, I see that there are strange marks in 'edge'

these look like they were done when the plastic was being formed and are not damage when the plastic was properly set.

Also, the inside of the Filter Cap is not particularly flat ...

1n6861b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n6861b/the_full_story_of_my_paranoia/,The Full Story of My Paranoia,"This is a bit of a long story but that’s the thing about going crazy - it doesn’t happen all at once. It’s a slow boil until the pot rattles itself off the stove. I’m putting every detail here because the details are what made people roll their eyes. The details are what made me doubt myself. And the details are what eventually pushed me to start acting like a stalker, just to prove I had one.

I live alone in a one-bedroom on the sixth floor of a narrow, brick-and-glass building that pretends it’s “boutique” by way of a chalkboard in the lobby that says WELCOME HOME in cursive. My view is the back alley: a sliver of sky, a row of dumpsters, and the backs of cafes where staff stand in the doorways blowing steam off their hands in winter. In summer there’s the smell of hot metal and overripe fruit from the produce store. The alley hums differently every season. I know that now: what the humming should sound like when no one else is there.

I keep odd hours because I do copyediting and manuscript formatting for a small press that thinks deadlines mean “last minute or not at all,” so I send a lot of emails at 2 a.m. and nap in chopped-up blocks. Nights aren’t scary when you live at your own pace. Nights make sense. Nights are consistent.

In June, nights stopped being consistent.

It was small at first: my front door latch. If I let the door swing shut, it doesn’t click unless I turn the knob and push it into the frame. For the first two years, I learned the muscle memory. Then, suddenly, I’d come home from the elevator and the door would be even with the jamb, silent. 

You think you forgot. You make a note. I started a list in the Notes app called “Am I losing it?”. It was half a joke. I wrote:

1. 06/12: door shut quiet??
2. 06/13: coffee mug moved? (I leave it slightly skewed on the drying mat; it was parallel to the edge.)
3. 06/15: faint cigarette smell in hallway at 11 p.m. (No one on my floor smokes; I know because the property manager wasted an entire tenants’ meeting threatening to fine people.)
4. 06/17: coin on the bookshelf slid? (I keep a toonie on the corner of a shelf like a paperweight; it helps me remember where I set down the envelope with rent receipts. Don’t ask me why the coin matters. It mattered to me.)

I told myself I was making content out of nothing. I told myself my brain likes patterns, and anxiety will feed it. Kara (best friend) told me the same thing over wine: “You work alone. Your sense of time is fuzzy. It’s an off week. Leave your apartment messy on purpose. See if anything actually changes.”

So I started leaving “tells.” A hair taped across my bathroom drawer. A thread balanced on my bookshelf coin. A Q-tip wedged between my sliding balcony door and the rail. Not paranoid. Just curious. Like a kid setting flour on the floor and waiting for Santa’s boot prints.

On 06/21, the hair across the drawer was cut cleanly in the middle, both ends still trapped under the tape. A pair of cuticle scissors were laying by my soap dispenser.

I stared at it for a long time. The scissors were mine. I hadn’t used them. I called Kara. She said I’d probably snagged it myself and didn’t remember. She said, “Hey, we used to tape hair across our dorm mini-fridge, and it always fell off because of humidity.” She said, “You’re scaring yourself.”

I bought a doorbell camera. My camera lasted one night before a stern-looking security guard knocked and asked me to remove it. Dark hair, dark eyes, early thirties, knuckles like he’d worked with his hands before sitting in a lobby. He introduced himself as Aiden and said the rule wasn’t his; he just had to enforce it. “If you want to point something inside, go for it,” he added, lowering his voice like he was doing me a favor. “Just not into the hall.”

The management company sent a mass email within 24 hours of that night reminding tenants that cameras were not allowed on the hallway side of unit doors. For privacy reasons, they claimed.

So I did what Aiden said and set the camera inside, angled at the door. That was the night the camera battery died at 3:12 a.m., despite showing 86% at midnight. I woke to the colorless smear of dawn and a low battery chime. No footage. The door was shut quietly.

I started sleeping with the TV on. Not because I thought the sound would deter anyone but because the static blue wash on the wall would wake me if a shadow moved. The truth is I started sleeping like prey: shallow, with a rope of dread twisted under my ribs. You can’t live that way and be a person during the day. During the day you forget your own passwords and leave a burner on. During the day you pour milk into the sink and realize you were aiming for your coffee.

On 06/26, I found a folded paper napkin under my doormat when I came in from a run. It was the cheap brown kind from the café downstairs. Inside someone had printed, in narrow, careful block letters:

YOU FORGOT THE GREEN ONIONS AGAIN

It was true. I'd spent the last few days reminding myself that I needed to stop at the grocery store and pick some up. My brain told me to not make this about me. It’s a joke. Someone teasing their roommate. Not for me. But it also reminded me that it was my doormat the note had been left under.

I took a picture and added it to my list before taking a shower. I made a quick run after lunch to pick up some groceries and tried to put it again out of my mind.

The next morning there was a note inside my apartment. A yellow sticky note on my kitchen counter I swear I hadn’t put there. Same handwriting. Block letters that tried to look friendly by putting hearts in the middle of the O’s, which did the opposite.

ONION GREEN IS NOT GREEN ONION

I called the non-emergency line. The operator’s voice was soft with fatigue. “Has there been a break-in?”

I told her the latch thing. The hair. The napkin. The sticky note.

“Ma’am, we can send a patrol to check the building, but unless there’s damage or an intruder, there’s not much we can do. Have you notified your property manager?”

“Yes.”

“And?”

“And he said, ‘Make sure you’re locking the door.’”

A patrol came, took one look around, and told me to get a better lock. The locks are drilled into a steel frame set by the building. The super isn’t authorized to change the hardware. The company has a master key. “It’s a security issue if every tenant has their own,” the super explained, eyes sliding off mine. His name is Gerard but everyone calls him Gerry. He’s the kind of man who calls women “kiddo” past fifty and thinks it’s charming but he seemed harmless to me.

The sticky notes multiplied. They were never threatening, not in a way that would trigger anyone else’s alarm but mine. They were corrections. They were comments. They were edits.

YOUR SPLATS OF OLIVE OIL ON THE STOVE ARE GREASY; RUN THE HEAT A LITTLE LOWER.

A FEW MORE MINUTES AND YOUR COFFEE WON’T BE SOUR.

YOUR SHOES WILL LAST LONGER IF YOU DON’T KICK THEM OFF BY THE HEEL.

And once: YOU LOOK GOOD IN RED. GO BACK FOR THE SWEATER. 

I had tried on a sweater at a consignment shop on Dundas and put it back because I’m not actually a red person.

I started scanning faces everywhere: in line at the café, on the streetcar, in the reflection of the subway window. The security guard from the camera day, Aiden, smiled when I came in and asked if everything was okay. He had the practiced gentleness of people who get yelled at professionally. 

I said I thought someone might have a copy of my key. “You’d be surprised how often that happens,” he said. “Contractors, old supers, roommates… You can get your own deadbolt installed high up. They usually allow that.” He glanced up, measuring my height. “You might need a stool to reach it though.”

I’m five-two on a good day. I laughed, too quickly. “I’m not paranoid,” I told him. “It’s probably nothing.”

“Probably,” he said. “But paranoia is just a safety feature. Like a seatbelt. It’s dumb right up until it’s not.”

Every story has a moment where you could pull the fuse out before the fire gets to it. Here’s mine: I started following people.

Not like a pro. Not like the movies. I’d see a man whose hair was the same almost-black as Aiden’s but with a different jawline and I’d keep going after my coffee and then, without making a choice, I’d turn when he turned. If his bag had a frayed strap, I’d fixate on it and decide the fray was a clue. If he held the door for a woman and looked after her a beat too long, I’d decide that beat was intent. If he got off at my stop and stayed for three blocks in front of me, I’d slow down so he could pass me, then I’d fall in. I took pictures of shoes, backpacks, the backs of heads. I put them in a folder called “Crowns” because, from behind, people are mostly scalp and the idea made it less creepy.

On 07/3, I saw my handwriting on a sticky note in the corner of my bathroom mirror. It looked like a mirror’s version of me: familiar and wrong. It said:

ANYONE WOULD THINK YOU’RE CRYING IN HERE.

The handwriting wasn’t mine. It was pretending to be. The O’s had those tiny hearts, like a tell. It’s grotesque what your brain does with a detail like that. For the rest of the night, every O I typed looked like an opened mouth.

Kara came over and did a full sweep like we were in a procedural drama. She checked the air vents. She looked for pinholes in the walls. “You’re giving someone the show they want,” she said finally, trying to sound gentle and landing somewhere resentful. “If there’s anyone at all. You’ve lost weight, Soph.”

“I’m eating,” I said. (I wasn’t. I was gnawing. There’s a difference.)

“You’re sleeping?”

“Yes,” I lied.

She looked at my couch. The pillow had a sweat shadow in the shape of a skull.

“Let me stay.”

“I don’t want you to think I’m crazy,” I blurted, and then laughed, and then cried in the bathroom with the faucet running so Kara wouldn’t hear the shape of it.

The next night we set the trap like we were twelve: a glass of water balanced precariously atop the door, hair across the drawer, tape on the deadbolt, salt sprinkled on the kitchen floor to dust for footprints like detectives who couldn’t be bothered to buy powder. We huddled in my room with the lights off, whispering until whispering turned into jerky laughter.

At 2:44 a.m., the front door clicked. A careful click. Not the crash of our paranoia rewarded. Just a careful click, like thirty other nights. The water didn’t fall. The deadbolt tape was intact. The salt looked smooth.

At 2:48 a.m., the bathroom fan turned on by itself. It’s motion-sensing. Sometimes it’s finicky. Kara whispered, “Maybe your pipes are haunted.”

We lay there and watched the ceiling. Every distant door slam in the building. Every elevator shudder. Every dawn bird that mistook the city’s light for the sun and started early. Kara fell asleep snoring lightly at 3:10. I lay awake until 5 before exhaustion took me to sleep.

The sticky note the next morning said:

LOVE THE SLEEPOVER. BRINGS ME BACK.

I took it to the building office. Gerry said, “Kids have too much access to prank supplies. We never had this problem with real tape.”

“I want the locks changed.”

“We can do that when there’s a turnover.”

“I want them changed now.”

“We don’t authorize one-off changes,” he said. “And anyway, if someone’s being a creep, changing the lock won’t stop notes under the door.”

“It was on my counter.”

He shrugged. He looked forty-seven and bored in unpressable pants. “Maybe your friend thought it was funny.”

The thing about losing your mind is that the world starts treating you like you already did. That’s the practical harm. The existential harm is that you start treating yourself the same way. You start leaving yourself little bribes: If I’m good for a whole hour, I can look through the peephole. If I finish this chapter, I can check the deadbolt tape. You bargain with your fear like it’s a toddler.

On 07/8, I followed a man into the grocery store on College because his shoes looked familiar. (Dark sneakers, white soles, a notch in the leather near the right big toe.) I pretended to examine green onions. He stood close enough to reach past me for cilantro. I could smell his gum, mint sharp, almost medicinal. He wasn’t looking at me. He was looking at the price. That’s not a thing I ever noticed before this: how hard some men look at prices. He took his cilantro and went. I watched the shape of his shoulders under his jacket and thought of photographs where something terrible has already happened but all anyone can see is light.

He turned right on Beatrice. I turned right on Beatrice. He cut across to the next block, and I followed from the other side of the street. Then he stopped at a laundromat and bent to tie his shoe. He wasn’t looking at me. I could have walked past. Instead, I stopped too, ten paces back, and pretended to check my phone. He looked up. We made eye contact that felt like a knife in the air between us. He frowned. He said, politely but confused, “Can I help you?” and I said, “Sorry,” and fled.

I went home and triple-checked the balcony Q-tip. It was missing. The door was still latched from the inside.

That same day, a maintenance notice went up in the lobby: Annual fire alarm inspection, 07/12-07/14. Entry to units between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. with notice. I circled the date on my paper calendar. I told myself this was normal, necessary. I told myself this was good, people with clipboards who aren’t allowed to be creepy. I told myself a hundred things. It was like trying to nail fog to the wall.

On 07/12, a man with a plastic visitor’s badge and a can of air stepped into my apartment for “15-20 minutes, tops,” to test the ceiling sensors. He had forearms like he lifted actual ladders, not the lightweight aluminum ones the company uses. He kept his baseball cap on, low. He said he needed to check the smoke detector in the bedroom too. When I said I’d follow him, he shrugged like, “Sure, whatever.” He took the smoke detector off its base with a twist and checked something I couldn’t see. Then he put it back with a harder twist, like a lid. He smelled like spearmint gum and faint cigarette smoke. 

When he left, I took the detector down myself. I stood on the stool Aiden had teased me about needing and reached up with both hands and tried to curry the plastic loose with my fingernail. I took the whole round plate off. There was nothing but the white belly of a standard unit and a printed date of manufacture. I felt stupid and paranoid. I wanted to cry. I put it back and it didn’t quite click. I had to wiggle it until it sat flush again. For the rest of the afternoon it blinked red every forty seconds like a little heart too slow to save anyone.

That night the sticky note said:

YOU’RE RIGHT. RED ISN’T YOU.

I don’t have space here for every small way I came apart. It wasn’t dramatic. It was a fine thread unspooling over two weeks while the world went on being its crisp self: buses huffed and sighed; pigeons bickered; a kid on my floor wore a dinosaur jacket with felt spikes and refused to go anywhere unless he could press his own elevator button. I kept working. I kept showering. (Sometimes I could feel the exact place an unfamiliar eye would stand if it could watch me: in the doorway, slightly to the right, where you can see the mirror without being in it.) I kept grocery shopping badly, as demonstrated by the notes. I kept checking my tape on the deadbolt and finding it torn, and I kept telling myself it must be my own hands. I kept sleeping with the TV on but woke anyway, bone-stiff from shivering in fights I mostly lost.

On 07/16, I snapped. I mean that in the most boring sense: something inside me just didn’t stretch anymore. I told my boss I needed a week. I packed a bag without my toothbrush because I had an irrational thought about someone touching the bristles. I booked a $102 room in a budget hotel near the Gardiner because I figured if you’re going to be watched, be watched where there are security cameras every ten feet and men in suits practicing their neutral faces for meetings.

I told no one where I was going. Not Kara. Not my parents. Not the “Please text when you get home” group chat comprised of three people who all live in different time zones and therefore know how to say “love you” without punctuation. I felt guilty about that. Then I felt guilty about feeling guilty. Then I drank two tiny hotel vodkas and fell asleep in sheets that smelled like industrial citrus.

At 2:03 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: If you're going to hide, you should book a place with better curtains.

I lay there with the phone lighting the bottom half of my face and actually argued with myself about whether to turn on the bedside lamp. Turning it on would make me a silhouette. Not turning it on made me a target for whatever was already in the dark. People always say that in stories. It sounds ridiculous. But it’s true in your body: the dark is a physical thing sitting on your chest.

I texted back before I could stop myself: Who is this?

The three dots came up immediately. Then:

UNKNOWN: You don't lock your balcony door. Not well.

I was on the 12th floor. The balcony was a pane of glass facing the highway and the cold. I stood up from the bed and felt my knees go wrong. I pulled on my coat and my shoes while texting 911 with shaky thumbs. I was on the phone with a calm woman who kept me repeating the hotel name when someone knocked, quick and polite. The fire alarm on the ceiling tinked once, like a spoon against a glass.

“Ma’am? Security.” A man’s voice through the door. Different from Aiden’s timbre but same flat politeness. “Everything okay?”

“Ma’am?” A pause. Longer. Softer. “Sophia?”

I opened the door.

Despite everything screaming at me to not open the door, I opened the door because he knew my name and said it like we were in a conversation already. The man in the hall wore the hotel jacket and a lanyard and had that same nothing face men wear when they expect to be bumped by a rolling suitcase. He took in the room behind me and then looked past me to the sliding glass balcony door and said, “You want to close that.”

The balcony door was open a hand’s width. The winter air made a little ribbon of itself on the carpet.

He stepped in like he owned the space, and for a second, relief won. He shut the door hard enough to make the glass bounce in its track. He pulled the drapes shut. “Someone’s been on the balcony above,” he said. “There was snow kicked down. It hits the alarm sensors sometimes.” He shrugged. “Kids. Sorry you were disturbed.”

“Someone texted me.”

“Could be a prank.” He looked at my phone, my fingers clenched around it like a handle. “We can move you to another room.”

He led me down the hall to a new door and opened it with a clean beep of his master key. He glanced at the bed, the window, the neat hotel painting. He stood there like he was waiting for something, and then he said, “Take care of yourself, Sophia.”

He left. I sat on the edge of the new bed, shivering in a way that felt like each muscle was getting its own small bad news. I looked back at the text.

UNKNOWN: You're sweet when you panic.

There is a point past which you can’t be soothed anymore by rational explanations. It took me too long to get there. When I did, I packed my bag again, checked out, and rode in a rideshare with a driver who wanted to tell me about his cousin’s restaurant across town while I tried not to cry. I went back to my apartment at 4 a.m. because I wanted everything familiar.  Even the lousy parts. I wanted the alley’s hum. I wanted the elevator’s judder. I wanted to know my fear by its first name.

The deadbolt tape was torn.

The sticky note on my counter said:

HOTEL SOAP MAKES YOU ITCH. NEW LIP BALM THO. YES.

I walked into my bathroom and looked at my face. There was a red ring around my mouth where I’d been licking, nervous, then smoothing balm over the sore spots. I sat on the closed toilet and shook like I had the flu. When I could stand again, I pulled the smoke detector down. I held it in my lap like a baby while I pried at the seam with a butter knife. The plastic creaked. On the third try, it gave. The back plate came away in my hand.

There was a microSD card taped inside the dome with surgical tape.

It wasn’t a camera. But its presence was a gunshot in a winter field. It made all the birds rise at once. I set the detector down and stepped backward like it could explode.

Then I laughed. I laughed like a lunatic because I understood the trick: If I took the card out and went to anyone, Gerry, Kara, the police, what would I be showing them? A card I found in my own apartment in a place I could have put it. If there was anything recorded on it, the only thing it would prove is that my bedroom existed.

I sat on the floor and texted Kara: Please come over. It’s bad. I didn’t hit send. I stared at the three words “Please come over” and thought about how many times in my life I’d needed someone and made it sound like nothing. I deleted the text. I mean, he had my number. He had…I don’t know. Whatever he had.

At dawn, I went downstairs to the lobby.

Aiden was behind the desk. He looked up with his gentleness and then really looked. He came around the desk with his palms up like you do for a frightened animal. “Hey. You okay?”

I put the smoke detector in his hands.

He took it with care. He looked at the card and then he looked at me the way people do when they’re trying to put their face far away from their eyes. “Who else has the master keys?” I asked.

“Me. Gerry. The property manager. Cleaning contractors for move-outs. The fire inspection team for the week. I’ll go check the camera logs.”

“There aren’t cameras on my hall,” I said. “Remember? Privacy.” It came out mean. I didn’t mean it for him.

“In the lobby,” he said. “Stairwells. Elevator.”

He went behind the desk and scrolled. He took down timestamps like he was trying to keep them from evaporating. He said, “If you’ve been feeling weird at night, there’s a guy who keeps letting himself in from the alley exit. That door is supposed to lock. I’ll have Gerry fix it.”

“Who?”

“Hoodie. Ball cap. Looks down. After midnight, mostly.” He glanced at me. “It could be nothing. Food deliveries.”

“Food deliveries don’t go up in the elevator without calling.”

“Some do.” He hesitated. “Can I ask you a question?”

“What?”

“Have you dated anyone in the building?”

“What? No.”

“Anyone who-” he faltered “-had reason to make you want to feel watched.”

I thought about the embarrassing “Crowns” folder on my phone. I thought about the man at the laundromat, the way he’d looked at me like I was the problem, because I had been. I thought about my brain clutching a shoe notch like a relic.

“No,” I said. “I don’t stalk people.” It sounded weak to my own ears.

“I didn’t say that,” Aiden said.

“What do I do?”

“Move out,” he said, too quickly, like he regretted it immediately. Then, because that wasn’t helpful: “We’ll check the stairwells and the roof. I’ll walk you to your unit. Change your routines. Don’t go home at the same time. Don’t leave the balcony door unlatched.”

“I don’t.”

He didn’t argue.

That night I slept under the opera of my own pulse. At 1:12 a.m., the elevator thrummed through the wall. At 1:14, the motion-sensing bathroom fan clicked on, and I lay there staring at the ceiling, counting the red blink of the smoke detector like the metronome of a slow heart.

At 1:17, my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: You broke my eye. I forgave you. That’s love.

I turned on every light. I stood in the kitchen breathing with my palms flat on the counter until my fingers ached. I didn’t text back. I didn’t call the police. I put my phone into the refrigerator to shut it up. Not a permanent solution, but enough so I could hear anything else besides it. I took the butter knife and slid it into my sleeve. 

I opened my front door without letting the latch click, and then I shut it loudly, hard enough to make a show of it. I locked the deadbolt. I slid the chain. I went to the bedroom and shut that door quietly like I was tucking in a child. Then I got into the closet. I know: why not leave? Because I wanted to see his face. Because I wanted to know if the horror had a shape.

I sat in the closet behind winter jackets that smelled like last year’s snow and waited. At 1:39, the elevator hummed. At 1:42, my front door made a sound that was almost nothing, the tiniest accommodation of wood to metal. At 1:43, someone breathed.

I’ve thought about describing it better. About how a stranger’s breath in your home is a sound like a stray animal in a church but breath is breath. It’s proof that something else is living in the place where you are living. It was close enough to hear. It was near the bedroom doorway. It came with the smell of spearmint gum and cold air.

The tiny red light at the corner of my closet ceiling, the one I had stopped being able to see because it blinked so slowly, went dark, then bright: the smoke detector cycling. There was a snap of fingernails flicking the plastic. A weight settled on the edge of my bed: the crease of the mattress, the tiny sound of fabric protesting. A rustle near the duvet, a hand (I think) feeling the warm shape I’d left there with pillows under the covers like a bad movie. A sound that might have been a chuckle and might have been a breath caught on a stitch of cloth.

I waited until my legs shook uncontrollably. I waited until he got up. I waited until the weight of the bed released and the air in the room changed. He moved around like someone in a home he had learned by touch: a soft bump of knee to coffee table; the little finger taps on the doorframe as he passed. He paused in the hallway. The spearmint smell came closer. He put his face toward the closet, I think. The coats wavered around me and fell back like a sea. He scraped his thumb slowly across the closet door’s seam. Then he moved away.

The deadbolt slid with a sound like metal softly kissing itself. The door closed with that careful hush I knew so well. The chain was left dangling, a touch less straight than before.

I didn’t move for ten minutes. The closet turned into a world. When I opened the door, the apartment looked like a set after a scene: bed unruffled, kitchen red digital clock telling a lie about time. The sticky note on the counter said:

YOU’RE GETTING BRAVER.

That was the first time the police took me seriously. Not because of the note. Because of the audio. The old phone I’d shoved between two cookbooks on the shelf had picked up the deadbolt, the chain, the footfalls, the faint scritch of a thumb on wood, the whisper that sounded like, “Good girl,” or maybe, “Don’t curl,” like a sports coach telling someone to keep their form. (Tell me which is worse.)

An officer named Blevins came, looked at the microSD card, and shrugged, but when he heard the audio and saw the torn deadbolt tape and the chain slack, he stopped shrugging. “He knows the building,” he said. “He’s comfortable in here. He wants you to know he’s comfortable. He wants you to feel proud when he approves of you. That’s…that’s a thing.”

They dusted for prints. They found mine, Kara’s, and someone else’s partials on the bathroom door and the inside of the front door near the chain. They sent me to sleep at Kara’s place while they “secured the scene,” which turned out to mean “took pictures, added tape of their own, and told the property manager about liability.”

When I came back the next afternoon with two officers, the sticky note was gone.

“That’s a taunt,” Blevins said, looking at the clean counter like it was an insult. “He wanted to show he could be in here when he wanted. He wanted to show us that evidence is optional when you have a key.”

They asked for footage. The building had lobby video that showed Gerry propping the alley door open at 12:50 a.m. and bringing in two flats of canned paint. It showed Aiden arriving at 10:58 p.m. It showed the fire inspection company bringing ladders and cases during the day. It showed a man in a dark hoodie riding the elevator at 1:39 a.m. with his head down. He didn’t look up at the camera. He tapped a key fob and the light blinked.

“Who is that?” Blevins asked.

Gerry looked uncomfortable. “Could be a contractor.”

“At 1:39 in the morning?”

“Sometimes we do off-hours work.”

“Who has that fob?”

Gerry scrolled and scrolled. The list of fob assignments was a spreadsheet on a dusty office computer. “Master,” he said. “Master, master, master.” He widened the columns. “Looks like one of the master fobs wasn’t checked back in after the last fire inspection day.”

Aiden said, very quietly, “It wasn’t me.”

“We’re not saying that,” Blevins said.

Aiden folded his arms across his chest and stared through the glass like the alley could give him an answer if he just focused hard enough.

“Do you recognize the shoes?” I asked, before my brain could stop me from asking the dumbest question in the room. 

Gerry said, “Shoes are shoes.”

Aiden looked at me and then looked at the screen. “He drags his right foot a little. You hear it?” He rewound. The sound was faint, but it was there: the smallest, irregular scrape on every other step. “That’s not a contractor. Contractors wear steel toes and walk like they have a schedule.”

“Who walks like that?” Blevins asked.

“Guys who don’t want to be noticed,” Aiden said. He hesitated. “Kids who used to shoplift. Guys who’ve done time.”

“You sure do have opinions,” Gerry said, fake-light. “Want to do my job too, buddy?”

“I’m doing it,” Aiden said.

That night I went to Kara’s anyway. The apartment felt like a mouth with a tongue in it that wasn’t mine. Kara made pasta and slid me a bowl and we watched garbage on TV. We laughed at a thing that wasn’t funny. We locked her door with both deadbolts and put a chair under the handle like we were seventy and living somewhere our bones were the only locks that mattered. I slept. I dreamed about shoes scuffing dust the color of ash.

At 3:07 a.m., my phone buzzed.

UNKNOWN: Isn’t it cozy to have a friend? You breathe quieter when you share.

Kara’s bedroom door was closed. I listened. I heard her, even in sleep, the little whistle she’s had since we were nineteen. I typed back before I could talk myself out of it: What do you want.

He answered:

UNKNOWN: To be let in.

I didn’t sleep again. We ate pancakes at dawn at a place where the tables are always sticky and the syrup bottle caps are welded with sugar. I took a nap at noon. When I woke up, there was a voicemail from Blevins. They had a name.

The man with the hoodie and the master fob was one of the fire inspection contractors. Not the one who’d come into my unit (that guy had a signed form with my signature and a time stamp that matched my memory). Another guy. A man named Colin with a record for trespassing and a sealed juvenile file that used to be an open joke in his family: “You know how teenagers are.”

They found him two days later because he went back to the building at 1:14 a.m. like terror had a calendar. Aiden saw him on the camera and didn’t wait. He went up the stairs to the sixth floor instead of taking the elevator, because you can hear a person coming on stairs. He met Colin at the top landing and didn’t do something heroic; he just said, “Hey, man,” in a voice that made my throat close when I heard it on the audio later. He talked like talking was a rope he could throw.

“What?” Colin asked, like he’d been woken from a nap.

“Walk with me,” Aiden said. “Let’s get some air.”

They walked down together because Aiden knows the building’s bone-familiar sounds: the difference between elevator hum and the click a decade-old fire door makes when it hasn’t been oiled enough; the rackety laughter from the unit with the three guys who live like season 2 of a TV show where nobody learns lessons; the hiss of the boiler; the thin, sharp cry of the new baby in 2B. They walked through the lobby under the chalkboard that said WELCOME HOME in cursive. They walked out into the alley where the dumpsters wear graffiti like tattoos. Then they turned left instead of right, which is important, because left is where the alley widens into a crook of shadow behind the café, and the security camera above the door has a blind spot there.

Aiden said, “Give me the fob.”

Colin said, “You’re not a cop.”

Aiden said, “No. I’m a witness.”

There’s a kind of silence in police audio that isn’t really silence. It has a shape. It makes its own weather. Then there was the sound of a scuffle: a squeal of rubber on grit, a curse. Then Aiden huffed, “Don’t,” and someone else said, soft, “Okay,” like he didn’t mean it.

When Blevins walked me through it later he kept his voice flat, like telling me a recipe. I think he was being kind. Aiden is okay. He has a line of purple on his forearm and a new dent in his watch. Colin had a flashlight in his pocket that wasn’t just a flashlight. It had a camera lens embedded where the bulb should be. The police found a small hard case in the trunk of his car with eight microSD cards neatly labeled with dates and unit numbers, and a folded paper napkin that smelled like coffee and the alley.

Some of the footage was mine.

He’d breathed in my hallway. He’d sat on my bed and watched the red light blink and blink and blink. He’d filmed himself writing notes on my counter with my pen, his hand careful and neat, and each O like a mouth open halfway in surprise.

He had other footage too. The old woman on 3A who takes naps in the afternoon with the TV volume high. The couple on 7D who fight and then have quiet, exhausted sex, a rhythm like rowing. The kid in 5C who leaves his coins lined up on his desk and cries when they fall. He had captured the everyday exhale of the building. He had captured me in the shower with the mirror fogged but not fogged enough, and I watched ten seconds of that before I leaned forward and threw up in a police station trash can, which is as undignified as it sounds.

They arrested him. There will be charges. There will be a trial, I’m told. There will be words like “pattern,” “prior,” “intent,” and “escalation.”

There will be a paper that says “order of protection” and “no contact” and a date. There will be a morning I wake up and a door will click again, and I will not know if the sound is my memory or a new breath. That’s not drama. That’s statistics. A man like that does not start and stop in neat lines because a pair of handcuffs drew a box around him. He slows, maybe. He redirects. He learns to look up at cameras.

People have been very kind since it made the rounds in the building. They bring me muffins. They say, “I never would have guessed; he looked normal,” and I say, “Everybody looks normal under fluorescent lights.” Kara cried and apologized like she’d been the one who taught him how to tape a card inside a detector. 

Aiden bought me a red sweater and left it at the desk with a sticky note that said, “You can pull it off.” I laughed so hard I startled a man waiting for a courier. I laughed because the O’s on his note were round and empty, just O’s, and because the sweater is a color I would never choose.

The building replaced every lock. They moved me to a unit on the other side of the floor so my windows look over the street, not the alley. I keep my curtains open at night and watch the lights slide across the ceiling as cars pass. It feels like the city is washing over me on a loop. It feels like breathing alongside something big.

Here is the part of the story I don’t know what to do with: even after the arrest, even after the evidence, there’s a part of me that thinks about the men I followed for blocks and the way their shoulders set when they felt me behind them. There’s a part of me that remembers how that felt, the heat of being the eye instead of the animal, and is ashamed. There’s a part of me that can’t stop wondering what attention looks like to someone like him when the thing you want most is a door opening softly.

“You can live in the world again,” Blevins told me when he dropped me off. “People don’t have to be the shape of your fear.”

I’m trying. I put plants on my window ledge and bite the dead leaves off with my fingers and feel proud. I cook ridiculous, messy things and leave oil splats on the stove and don’t wipe them off right away. I let my shoes get scuffed. I bought green onions and ate them raw over eggs. I close the door and let it click however it wants.

Sometimes I wake up at 1:43 a.m. and go stand in the hallway and listen to the building breathe. Sometimes the bathroom fan clicks on by itself and I laugh. Sometimes I put a sticky note on my own counter that says something kind: YOU DID ENOUGH TODAY. YOU ARE NOT AN ANIMAL IN A CHURCH.

And sometimes my phone buzzes at a time when it shouldn’t, and I throw it into the refrigerator out of habit. Old tricks for new days. I always take it out. I always check.

There are no more texts. Just notifications from my banking account or an email from a website I keep meaning to unsubscribe from.

There is a crumpled napkin inside my front door, though, wedged so it fell when I opened it yesterday, after work. The napkin is blank. It smells like coffee and alley air. Not impossible, there’s a café downstairs, but specific.

I stared at it for a long time with my coat still on and keys in my hand. Then I folded it in half and in half again and in half again until it was a compact, damp square that will not come unfolded without force. I slid it under the toonie on the shelf. I didn’t take a picture. I didn’t add it to a list. I just let it be the size it is.

Because here is the very last thing I learned: a person can be both wrong and right at the same time for a very long time. I was wrong to make the city smaller by carving it into threats with my eyes. I was right to listen to the parts of the night that were not my own.

If you’re reading this because you think you might be crazy, I don’t know what you should do. I’m not an expert. I’m not a movie. I can only tell you what I did: I paid attention until the day the attention pointed to something other than me. I made a record. I told the truth even when it made me look bad. I learned the sound my door makes when it is closed carefully from the inside by someone who is not me.

I've been married for about two years and my husband and I have always liked going out together and drinking on the weekends. When we first met, we went out like once every two weeks. However, over the past 7 years this has slowly devolved into him becoming a binge drinker. There was a period for around 6 months where he was unable to work earlier this year and that's when it got particularly bad because he didn't have a set schedule or responsibilities. 

He is working now again and things are better. He still likes to party and go out, but sometimes he can just have two beers and go home. Sometimes we get drunk one night and he's fine the next day, or only has a few beers the next day in the evening. However, other times it's a full weekend binge. The night we go out he will stay up til 5 or 6 am drinking. He drinks until he passes out basically. Then, when he wakes up the next day he starts drinking again. He tries to hide it from me but I hear him crack open a beer in the shower/ bathroom. Then he spends the whole day getting plastered without eating or barely eating. After that if it's a Sunday, he may even keep going. Three or four days he will keep drinking. 

I am just having a really hard time understanding why sometimes this happens and other times he can control it. I'm at my wits end honestly. For awhile we didn't keep alcohol in the house, however, we had family in town last week so now there is alcohol readily available.  
  
I basically spend weekends like this babysitting him and making sure he is okay. However, by the second day he's pretty unpleasant to be around. Today, was a holiday and I worked but he kept drinking. I felt so disgusted and upset. I know that a lot of times he likes to drink and hang out with me so I just left the house and worked from a coffee shop. I'm not sure if me being gone helped or just made him get more plastered because he felt lonely.

First unit: endless “Add Water” errors. Drove across town to swap it, got what looked like a refurbished unit… and it was defective out of the box. Support slow, software clunky, overall feels like a $350 prototype. 🍋

⸻

I wanted to love this thing. I really did. The design is beautiful, the promise is huge, and the hype is everywhere. But owning the Fellow Aiden has been like buying a Ferrari that spends more time in the shop than on the road.

Two units, two disasters:
	•	Unit #1: constant “Add Water” errors even when the tank was full. Went through all the troubleshooting, flushed, descaled, reseated. Nothing. → Returned.
	•	Unit #2: I had to drive to the store and pick up what looked like a refurbished replacement. The valve on the water tank was loose, I clicked it into place, but it still leaked the moment I filled it. → Countertop puddle, rising blood pressure.

Support = pain:
Feels like buying a Ferrari and finding out the pit crew clocks out early. Long waits, vague replies, no urgency. No real ownership of the problem — just me going in circles while nothing gets fixed.

Software = half-baked:
No simple “brew now” button. Wake up early? Too bad — you wait ten minutes while it warms up like you’re idling in the pits. Want to share brew profiles? Only if you buy their beans. For $600+, that’s insulting.

The kicker:
This is supposed to be a daily driver. Instead, it’s a fragile toy. Two units in a row, both defective. If this isn’t a lemon, I don’t know what is.

Bottom line:
When it actually works, sure, it can brew a beautiful cup. But day-to-day? It’s been frustration layered on frustration. The Fellow Aiden feels less like “precision coffee” and more like “paying to beta test.”",2,1756780807.0,FellowProducts,2,0.75,False

Many people are intrigued by its health benefits but struggle with the taste. Imagine sipping a cup that not only boosts your energy but also delights your taste buds. Sounds perfect, right? This article will show you how to transform your mushroom coffee into a delicious, crave-worthy beverage.

We’ll share simple tips and tricks that can make your morning routine something you look forward to. So, if you’re ready to enjoy every sip of your mushroom coffee, read on—you won’t want to miss this!

# Choosing The Right Mushrooms

Chaga, Lion’s Mane, and Reishi are popular mushroom choices. Each has a unique taste. Chaga offers a mild, earthy flavor. Lion’s Mane has a sweet, nutty taste. Reishi is more bitter but healthy.

Mushrooms give many health benefits. They boost the immune system. They help reduce stress. These mushrooms improve focus and memory. They are rich in antioxidants. This means they fight harmful cells.

# Balancing Bitter Notes

Adding sweeteners can help balance the bitter taste of mushroom coffee. Honey is a natural choice and adds a rich flavor. Maple syrup gives a sweet and earthy taste. Agave nectar is a good option for those who want something mild. Stevia is perfect for a sugar-free choice. Each sweetener brings its own unique flavor. So, try different ones to find what you like best.

Creamy additions make coffee taste smoother. Milk and cream are classic options. They reduce bitterness and add richness. Almond milk is a good non-dairy choice. It’s light and nutty. Coconut milk adds a sweet twist. Oat milk is another non-dairy favorite. It’s creamy and mild. Try different creams to find your favorite taste.

# Enhancing With Spices

Add a pinch of **cinnamon**to your mushroom coffee. It brings warmth and sweetness. Nutmeg adds a rich, nutty flavor. Together, they create a cozy drink. Perfect for cold days. Stir well before sipping. Enjoy the new taste adventure!

A drop of **vanilla**makes coffee smooth and creamy. Cardamom gives a unique, spicy kick. Mix them for a delightful twist. They balance the earthy mushroom taste. Your coffee will smell and taste amazing. Try it and see the difference!

# Experimenting With Brewing Methods

Using a **French Press**can make mushroom coffee taste better. Start with coarsely ground coffee and mushrooms. Boil water and let it cool slightly. Pour water over the grounds. Stir gently to mix. Put the lid on without pressing the plunger. Wait for about four minutes. Slowly press the plunger down. Pour the coffee into your cup. This method gives a rich, full flavor.

The **Cold Brew**method is another way to enjoy mushroom coffee. Mix ground coffee and mushrooms in a jar. Add cold water. Stir until well mixed. Cover the jar and place it in the fridge. Let it sit for 12 hours or overnight. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve or cloth. Serve over ice for a refreshing drink. This method makes the coffee smooth and less bitter.

I'm pretty quiet and introverted by nature, but once I warm up, I'm all about the fun vibes, deep conversations mixed with silly laughs.

My interests are pretty varied: love music (anything from indie rock to electronic beats), all sorts of sports (watching or playing football, rugby, you name it), reading, cycling around the city, hitting the gym for that endorphin rush, and lots more random stuff. 

Pretty keen on Astronomy, gotta love a clear night sky with a telescope. Recently got into Egyptian mythology (the gods, pyramids, and ancient lore fascinate me). Gaming is a big one too, whether it's FPS, co-op adventures, competitive multiplayer, or just chilling with story-driven single-player games.

Ideally, it'd be awesome to find anyone in London, to hang out with IRL (get coffee, explore parks on bikes). But online is cool too if you're not local. No pressure, just genuine platonic connections.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

1n67xfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n67xfc/my_roommate_found_a_new_pair_of_shoes_by_the/,My roommate found a new pair of shoes by the dumpster. We should have never put them on,"When guests visited our apartment, they always commented on the smell—something old, almost medicinal. We blamed the building’s age, and after removing their shoes to come in, they’d eventually stop noticing it. Three years later and I still smell it. Reminds me of hospitals from my childhood.

My roommate Paul had the bigger room because he was here first, and I had responded to an ad online to rent the other. Kitchen, common area where we had the TV and our gaming consoles, dining nook, and a covered patio. Paul and I got along even though we came from different worlds. His was one that required a lot of posturing with friends and being perpetually online. Mine was maybe lonelier.

Somehow, we clicked, and after our respective workdays we often found ourselves collaborating on meals and playing games late. I liked RPGs; he preferred co-op shooters which I joined reluctantly because he got frustrated, yelled, and gave me side-eye whenever I suggested staying calm. He blamed his thick fingers.

From our apartment you could look down at a parking lot where every Tuesday garbage trucks made their rounds at 7 a.m. to the chagrin of tenants whose bedrooms faced that way, like mine.

I feel like these are important details. I’m describing my life as it has been for a while. It’s where I live, and it’s where I am now. It’s the mundane little facts that I need to tell you, so that they serve as counterweights to the hefty truth I’m about to unload, in search of sober advice. I just need to tell it so that you can understand. You won’t understand, but I’ve got to at least try.

“Olly, check it out!” I remember Paul said. I slurped some cheerios messily and looked up from my phone.

“What up?” I said.

“Those look new.”

I lazily pulled myself up and looked out the window.

“Huh? What, where?”

“Those shoes. I’m gonna go get them.”

Paul rushed out and soon emerged in the parking lot. I watched him step gingerly in his moccasins to the dumpster, and scoop up the pair of bright white sneakers, grinning up at me as he scurried back.

The door slammed. I pressed into my lower back to stretch as Paul came in. He proudly displayed the pair of shoes in one hand and snapped with the other.

“Tight!”

“They don’t stink,” I said.

The shoes were completely white, and despite sitting by a dumpster were impeccably clean.

“Smell like roses, these,” he said.

“Well, will they fit?”

“Size 11 baby!” he confirmed.

“Nice coincidence.”

Now we’ve come to the part of the story I can’t really expect you to believe. I wouldn’t. In my family we’ve seen tragedy. My younger brother was born with a disease that meant lots of operations before he could even walk. Hospitals became second homes; iodine soap a familiar salve; plastic-wrapped food and peel-back tin capped juice in those milky plastic containers a family meal. I accompanied my parents every time they went, and each time was like sucking the color out of dreams, the whimsy out of imagination. I didn’t grow up all at once, but my childhood was not child friendly. I learned that life was limited, solutions pragmatic and usually muted and smelly.

“Lemme try ‘em on,” said Paul.

He sat on the couch, pulled off his moccasins, put on the right shoe, then the left. And disappeared.

As soon as he put those shoes on, he was gone. Gone not in any sense that is common. I mean gone without any real-world indication that he was there before. Gone without any vision, nor any sound that would signal his disappearing. He was there, then he wasn’t, as if his existence simply ceased.

I watched the couch cushion slowly reform itself where Paul had been sitting. I was still standing, but I had moved back up against the wall and my palms were pressed against it as if expecting the room to suddenly fall away or for gravity’s pull to shift 90 degrees.

What felt like eternity was only a minute, and then Paul was back, sitting on the couch, panting, one of the new shoes in his hand. He looked around like a stranger before finding my eyes and locking on, making me feel like prey.

“Fuck!” I yelled.

“Fuck,” he whispered. He slowly regained control of his breathing and then yelled, wide-eyed at me. “Fuck! Olly!”

“What!” I screamed back, shaking. “What!”

Blood rushed back into his face as his complexion softened, and his eyes narrowed.

“Bro,” he said. “You won’t believe it.”

I didn’t believe it. He told me that he was in a forest. He said it was hot and humid, and the noises of insects, birds and dripping rain were as vivid as anything here. He struggled to recall things at first because of the shock, but as we calmed down, he told me he had truly been there, in the rainforest, standing on moist black dirt and looking up at sunlight piercing canopy. He said it smelled ‘exquisite’, a word that was out of character for him.

“You’re saying you were in the Amazon?” I said finally.

“No idea bro,” he said. “Amazon maybe. I don’t know.”

“Maybe Borneo?”

“I don’t know. The rainforest man. The deadass rainforest.”

“Alright,” I said.

By now he had taken off the other shoe and the pair was just sitting there in front of us on the rug.

Paul eyed me. Looked at the shoes.

“Yup,” he said. “You gotta.”

“The hell I do,” I countered.

“You gotta.”

He grimaced, reading my face, I guess.

“You wanna, Olly. You wanna, trust me.”

I did. I felt calm enough to know that I did. I had to try this. They’d fit my size 10 feet.

I bent down and grabbed one, slipped it on my socked foot. Grabbed the other, and held there, staring at Paul.

“What should I—you know,” I prompted.

“Fuck, right, dude. Listen. Just take the shoe off, it’s what I did, and pow, I’m back. Just take off the shoes.”

This was our exchange before I put the other shoe on, and the apartment was immediately gone. No cues, no noise or visual of transition. Just there, and now here. Where was I? It wasn’t a forest like Paul; it was a field. I felt the sun on my skin. Hills in the distance, and a highway? A semi-truck rumbling past. Buildings in the distance.

I bent down and tore off a shoe, and was suddenly back in the apartment facing a roommate whose body language bounced with intrigue.

“Dude!” he yelled. “You just vanished!”

“My God,” I said. “Jesus Christ.”

He was nodding with his whole head and neck, as if vibing. Wide-eyed, unblinking.

“Sick, right? The rainforest—”

“—not a forest,” I said. “More like a prairie, I guess? But there was a road, a big truck. Buildings too.”

“No shit. I’d’ve checked out those buildings,” he said a bit curtly.

“Yeah but I came back before I could really get my bearings. It was crazy.”

“Crazy,” he repeated. “Crazy.”

We both looked at the shoe I held.

So, this is the secret. Magical shoes that transported us. Not unheard of in fiction but I am telling you that this happened to us. Paul went to a forest. I went to a prairie. We found a pair of shoes in the trash and put them on and were teleported to these destinations instantaneously.

It didn’t stop there. It couldn’t. Would you have stopped? Paul went again. When he came back, he told me he was on a hill overlooking a valley and could see a whole city that he didn’t recognize. I went again and found myself on a grey sand beach with a cold wind. We went a few more times like this. Once, I found myself on a snowy mountain, and when I reappeared in our apartment Paul said I was cold to the touch. There was even snow in my hair. Then Paul went again, and the asshole was gone for five whole minutes. When he returned, I was surprised to see him cradling about 10 mangos.

“What the hell?” I said.

“A mango orchard man, a bleeping orchard fer real!”

“Are they ripe?”

We took a break from teleportation over slices of fresh mango. We discussed our experience and decided that the destinations were random. We knew it didn’t matter if we walked around, that we always returned to the apartment. We knew there were cities, so we knew there were people. It was clearly Earth so whatever magic this was, it was here. But when was it? Had either of us seen anything out of whack for 2025? No, we hadn’t. Still no people.

“Maybe we should stop,” I remember saying. “Give it a rest maybe.”

Neither of us wanted to do that. We had the whole day still.

We took turns teleporting, and we learned more. We started to figure that eventually we should land in cities. A few times we each landed within sight of populations, but since we had agreed to a one-minute limit after Paul’s five-minute disappearance, we couldn’t yet reach those places. Paul begrudged the rule. We also figured that if we hadn’t landed in towns or cities yet, it was only because most of the globe is still just wild land, farms, or water.

Bad timing, to jinx ourselves like that.

I pulled on the second shoe and at once lost my senses. Not that I couldn’t feel, because the shock of cold was devastating and I gasped. Not that I couldn’t taste because when I gasped, I lost my breath as my mouth filled with icy salt water. Not that I couldn’t see but it was black night and then plunging darkness. Not that I couldn’t hear but it was shrieking wind and then warbled frigid water in ghostly depths that seemed to tear me in different directions.

I struggled, panic filled. Reach. But swim, swim! I thought. Must breathe, I knew, but I could escape this. I reached, and just as my lungs began to inhale, my frozen knuckles locked their fingers around a shoe and tugged it off.

Suddenly I was in the apartment on all fours heaving and vomiting saltwater over our rug. Shivering miserably, drenched completely. I felt Paul hitting my back. My ears were ringing, adjusting to the sudden warmth.

Paul brought water. Patted my back.

“I was,” I said. My voice sounded like gravel. “I was in the ocean, I think.”

Paul just stared, nodded. He was amazed and still I sensed, jealous?

Later I sat in my robe wrapped in towels before a humming space heater. I told him about the storm, the night. We had already experienced nighttime in the couple hours we had been at this adventure. I told him about the crashing waves that I couldn’t escape.

“We have to be more careful,” I said.

That had been enough for one day.

We agreed the shoes would stay in the living room, that we would only use them together. We spent the rest of the evening talking about it. Unbelieving, but convinced. We planned. From now on we had an entry position. We’d sit in cannonball position, but one leg crossing the other. Both hands would grasp the second shoe as we put it on, so that we’d already be prepared to yank it off in case of trouble. We considered other things like wearing a wetsuit and flippers, goggles, even an oxygen tank, given how likely it should be that we’d land in an ocean somewhere. But ultimately, we decided to buy a large plastic sheet from Home Depot and lay it out on the living room floor to catch water, and to purchase a simple lifejacket that wouldn’t hinder movement when teleporting plopped us on dry land.

I barely slept that night. As frightening as they were, these shoes changed my life. I was jittery with excitement, suppressing fear.

We both called in sick next morning. Of course we did.

Then we got into Paul’s car and went on our errands. Only took an hour.

Back at the apartment, we laid our new plastic sheet where the rug had been. Rug was hung to dry out on the patio. The life jacket was a small sea kayaker’s jacket. Stylish and minimal. We had also bought a small knife, some beef jerky, a headlamp, a length of high-strength static line, and bug spray. The jacket had pockets for these things.

We also decided to pack my phone in the jacket. It had a better waterproof rating than Paul’s, and my international roaming plan was less ghastly expensive than his, if we ever landed somewhere with signal. We wanted to take photos and videos. But mostly it was to set the timer, as we’d agreed to increase the time to five minutes. Later we’d increase it to ten minutes.

We shared a large breakfast of hashbrowns, egg sausage sandwiches and dark coffee. Then the adventure began.

As the morning progressed, an area of our living room began to look like a naturopath’s collection. On each trip, we’d bring something back. A rock. A branch. A flower or bundle of grass. Dirt, or sometimes trash. It was shocking how rarely we landed close to people yet how often we found trash. It became clear that we were hitting places all over the world. Wrappers with Chinese lettering, a grocery bag with Tamil (the phone translation app said), French, other languages we’d yet to identify.

On one trip Paul was gone over five minutes. I began to worry. His phone rang and I picked it up. ‘Olly’, it read. I accepted.

“Paul?” I said, haltingly.

“Brooooo!” I heard him yell. It was a perfectly clear call.

“Paul!” I exclaimed. I stood and paced. “Paul where are you?”

“I’m not sure but I got bars bro! So, I’m callin’.”

“Any landmark? What’s the climate?”

“Pretty dry. I think I’m in a desert, but there are power lines I see. I guess a cell tower’s close so.”

My hand was in my hair, as if calming my mind.

“Clear skies,” he said.

“Maybe you’re stateside somewhere? Southwest? Take a photo, we can reverse image search back here again. Or wait just open the map app, I downloaded a ton of regions last night.”

“Hold on.”

I waited a few seconds.

“No dice, no internet just calling. GPS shows I’m nowhere,” he said.

“Damn.”

“Yeah. Hey, Olly?”

“What’s up?”

Just then he appeared almost exactly where I was pacing and I bumped into him, knocking us both to the plastic-covered ground. We laughed maniacally.

When we calmed, he showed me some photos he’d taken.

“GeoGuessr eat your heart out,” I said.

“Huh?”

“You know, that Google Maps street view game? It shows you a street view somewhere on the planet and you guess where it is by dropping a pin on a map. Whoever’s closest wins. I played with colleagues a few times.”

“That’s an idea,” said Paul.

We created a map, named it ‘Jumping Jimmies.’ Then we did a reverse image search on one of the pictures that Paul had taken with my phone. While it wasn’t conclusive it gave us some lookalikes.

“Could be that one. ‘Red Sand’, in Saudi.”

“Mmm,” I said. “But look at that rock, a bit too unique. You woulda seen that. This one? Devil’s Desert?”

“Not sandy enough.”

“Namibia? No.”

“Wait, that one!” Paul exclaimed. “What’s that?”

“Oh yeah that looks good. Says ‘Atacama, Chile’.”

“Yes! That’s it I’m sure of it! Mark it.”

We chose a series of icons that we labeled by the percentage of how sure we were of each location. \~90% on the Atacama Desert, green circle.

Elation welled up in my heart. I had always loved to travel and now I was traveling the world incognito. Paul and I were prepared, ready, and eager. We thought we anticipated everything. If only we’d kept our guard up…

 

By evening many colorful icons dotted our map. We had taken dozens of photos, one of Paul’s toothy smile beside a grinning shepherd on a mountain road somewhere in Kyrgyzstan, another of a group of people at a bus stop in a Colombian town (Paul envied how often I landed with people).

“Yeah, you always get the good places,” Paul said. “I just get trees and hills. Every single time.”

Puddles pooled on the plastic tarp in our living room from a handful of times we found ourselves swimming. Paul wanted to visit a city, but I wasn’t ready to increase our time limit enough to walk to one or to board a bus like in Colombia. We had to take it slowly, and I knew that if Paul would be patient we’d land in one.

But then it finally happened.

Tokyo is the largest city on Earth, with a population over 30 million. Fitting then that it was the first big city we happened upon, or that I happened upon. I had learned to reign in my expectations when slipping on the second shoe. In less than an instant I was teleported onto a narrow road, remarkably carless and calm, staring up at skyscrapers glinting in sunlight. I recognized Japanese on the shopfront, and English accompanying all the street signs. In fact, I’d been to Tokyo before, and so the sight was familiar. The sight of me, however, less so. At least to a curious couple ogling me. I realized a foreigner in the middle of a Tokyo street wearing a lifejacket packed with survival items and awkwardly sat hugging his knees and grabbing a shoe would look bizarre.

I scampered to my feet and out of the way of a stout little delivery van driving past. I smiled at the couple who continued walking. I retrieved my cell phone; 09 minutes 04 seconds left before I should remove a shoe.

Something immediately caught my attention—the sweet scent of tempura frying. I located its source: a small restaurant with ubiquitous noren fabric hanging to mark its entryway. I was in Tokyo. I loved Japanese food, loved it absolutely. Here I was! I had to, right? We couldn’t control where we landed, so who knows when I’d happen upon Japan, and Tokyo itself, again? I found my hands searching my chest as I realized I had no money. We should’ve been traveling with credit cards at least. But they pay with cash here mostly. Impractical to travel with every currency, though, and impractical to expect a currency exchange.

Then it dawned on me, to my shame and to my joy, that I could dine and dash without so much as a step to flee.

Parted the noren to enter. Konnichiwa, hello. I sat at the bar in the narrow locale, removing my lifejacket ashamedly and hanging it on a hook underneath. I ordered the tendon by pointing. The aroma, the delectable crispy vegetables and shrimp, beautifully crisp, and umami flavors.

As if waking from a dream I remembered Paul and quickly checked the time. I was already ten minutes overdue! With averted eyes and utter embarrassment and shame for what they’d think, I snatched my lifejacket and ducked under the bar. Removed a shoe.

“Son of a bitch!” yelled Paul. “Where the fuck were you? I was freaking out man. We said ten minutes!” He sniffed. “What’s that smell?”

I begged his forgiveness and placed my hands on his shoulders, urging him onto the couch. Calm, calm.

“It’s toasted sesame,” I said. “I was in Tokyo. I ate tempura.”

“Tempura? That fried stuff they serve with sushi?”

“Sure, yeah.”

“Did you say... Tokyo? A city? You ate in a city!?” he yelled, smiling.

“Damn right,” I said.

“Jumpin’ jimmies!” he yelled, and I repeated that refrain reflexively. “Mark it down! A city, you lucky bastard. Lowkey smells insane. You lucky, lucky asshole. And you didn’t bring any back.”

“Damn it!” I said. “I’m sorry Paul, I didn’t think about it. When I saw the time—”

“—Yeah. All good. Man, I want to land in a city.”

Paul’s eyes were on the lifejacket, but not really. They were distant, imaginative. I couldn’t tell if he was more happy or more envious -- long stares are tough to decipher.

“You’ll get there man, I promise. We’ll get you there.”

For a moment annoyance crossed his expression, but it didn’t linger long enough for comment.

“Yeah,” he said plainly.

We jumped a few more times and then Paul said he wanted to take a break. Envious, it turned out. He was sulking. Disappeared into his room without too many words between us. I figured he’d just have to let it settle, and we’d be back at it in the evening.

I fixed myself a sandwich and ate it while observing our disorderly living room. Souvenirs, laptops, wet plastic. Then I retired to my own room, surprised to feel tired. I think the jumps take it out of you.

I sank into willful sleep.

 

When next I woke it was dark outside. I’d slept the whole afternoon. Clock read 9 p.m.

Out in the living room everything looked the same. Paul’s door was shut. My mouth felt dry and so I poured a glass of water and leaned on the counter, marveling at our mess again.

Then I saw.

The shoes were gone.

I set the glass down, and skipped to Paul’s door, knocked.

“Paul? You awake?” I opened it. “Paul?” Not there.

As I rushed back into the living room and started upending cushions in search of the shoes, it was like watching an actor in a movie you’ve already seen. I knew he’d taken them. I knew he jumped.

The lifejacket was on the floor. I retrieved my phone from a pouch. “Idiot,” I thought. “You left it.”

No missed calls, no texts. I called Paul’s phone and heard it ringing in his room. “Idiot,” I said to myself more sharply.

How long had he been gone? I looked for any new artifacts, any notes or new pins on our Google map. Nothing. I checked the tarp, which was mostly dry now. His car was still parked outside. I opened our front door and stuck my head out. Hallway was clear.

“This sonofabitch straight up donned the shoes and peaced,” I said aloud.

In anger I sounded more like Paul than myself. Oppressive silence seemed to coalesce. It was a bit more humid than normal—all the extra salt water. Suddenly our pile of artifacts and souvenirs seemed nasty, so I grabbed a garbage bag and shoved everything in, tied it off. I was helpless.

Hours went by. It was 3 a.m. by the time I felt tired again. My eyes stung. I drank some water and retreated to my bed where I finally let myself pass out.

 

Beep-beep-beep.

Groggy and petrified I calmed myself when I realized I was just waking up. The garbage truck upturned the dumpster, its metal arms clanging as it guzzled trash and then replaced the container, drove off. I fell out of bed. 7 a.m.

Out in the living room the scene was unchanged. No Paul. He had been gone for over 12 hours.

I cooked runny oatmeal, added raisins and slurped it. Could he have drowned? Didn’t take the lifejacket, the buffoon. Real possibility. Maybe he landed in Vegas and would pop back home to regale me with some story worthy of The Hangover. Wild animal could’ve attacked him, but I struggled to imagine he wouldn’t have the time to remove a shoe. Maybe he’s just on a hike. I knew I shouldn’t have eaten that tempura. I like Paul but I knew he was quick to jealousy. Why didn’t I smooth things over? It would’ve taken five minutes max. Paul’s ego wanted, needed to be coaxed. Two days and already we’re at each other’s throats? No that can’t be it. A misunderstanding maybe. He’s just off to prove a point. Don’t fuck with the rules, Olly, he’ll tell me. Tell yourself, man. Leaving precautions behind, no phone even. God damn it.

I was chewing on a raisin, the wet oatmeal juice resting in my mouth awaiting to be swallowed. I was staring at the plastic sheet on our living room floor. One moment that’s all I was doing; the next I was staring at a body.

Face-down. Shirtless. Holes in his back, blood pooling, some dripping down the torso. White shorts, pockets outturned, stained. One white shoe, stained. The other foot bare and dirty. Thick fingers, bent and broken on one hand. The way jumping works, it makes it seem that this body had been there for as long as I had been looking at that spot, that I’d been staring at it while I slurped cooling oatmeal. That I should feel guilty for only plunging into nightmare after the body appeared and not before.

Paul. Paul’s body. His hair, his broken hands. The smell. My mind recalled images of hospitals and gowns with geometric prints, hands scrubbing harsh brown bars of soap with foam that smelled medicinal and metallic and burnt. The smell of memory competed with the smell of death, one trying to sanitize the other because it cannot be. It can’t. He can’t be dead.

Oatmeal dribbled down my chin before I could close my mouth. It suddenly tasted like raw meat, and I spat into the sink. I became aware of my pounding heart playing catch-up. All my senses were delayed, as if reality could not so abruptly be changed, so noiselessly debased to this horror.

Each sniff triggered a gag. Each blink felt eternal. Give it enough time to just erase this. Blink it out of existence, I know it can be done. Please, please, please.

I write this anonymously. My name’s not Olly and his is not Paul. But I need help. There is a body, shot to death, laying on a plastic tarp in my living room. There’s only one shoe the other is gone. No one will believe me. What do I do?",12,1756780313.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

It kind of feels like we’re living on the cusp of a sci-fi movie. And we’re the protagonists!

Here’s why I’m personally so jazzed about the advances we’re seeing:

- **Accessibility is skyrocketing**: It’s no longer the hobby of research labs and lounge lizards at conferences. Open source frameworks, cloud platforms—anyone can dip their toes into ML for basically the price of a coffee.
- **Real world impact**: Machine learning already impacts our daily routines and we barely notice. Spotify knows your musical mood better than your best friend. Google Translate decodes menus in lands where you don’t even know the alphabet. 
- **Constant surprise factor**: Just when I think “It can’t get smarter…”—BAM! Transfer learning. Reinforcement learning. Language models finishing your sentences and dreams.

And what I love, truly, is the collaborative energy behind this. The open exchange of notebooks, datasets, and YES, failures and iterations, too—how magical is that? Learning is no longer confined to sterile textbooks or sleepless hackathons. 

Speaking of learning—raise your hand if you’ve ever felt overwhelmed trying to keep pace with all these shiny new ML concepts? 

Same! HIGH FIVE! 🙋‍♂️

Remember when neural networks sounded intimidating? Now even little projects can use convolutional, recurrent, and even transformer models(!) without writing a bazillion lines from scratch. The sheer volume of tutorials, bootcamps, and Discord servers out there makes it so dang inviting to test, snoop, remix, and GROW.

But here’s the real fun thought to debate—

- Is there such a thing as *too much* advancement in machine learning, too quickly?
- Are we building tools we always wanted, or opening Pandora’s algorithmic box?
- How do we keep the “happy chaos” of disruption, while ensuring fairness, accountability, and inclusiveness?

I get SO HAPPY to watch ML unfold across creative, scientific, and social corners. To anyone jumping in, struggling, breaking stuff, succeeding, or quietly observing—this ride’s a wild one, and you’re not alone. 

What’s *your* favorite “wait… ML can do THAT now?!” moment? Where do you see this all going (besides pizza drones, ofc)? 🍕

Let’s celebrate those jaw-dropping, smile-inducing breakthroughs and maybe tumble down an algorithmic rabbit hole, together!",1,1756780142.0,GPTAppsEngine,0,1.0,False

4. Tea

No explanation needed. Hard choice between tea and coffee but I personally like coffee more so that's the choice I made.

  
For me, this is the definitive top 4. I'm open to hearing people's thoughts about the rest of the ranking. (Where should beer go? What about newer beverages like kombucha? Is Coca-Cola top 5?)

I also take pre-workout occasionally before workouts and creatine afterwards. And sometimes, fish oil capsules as well.

Yesterday, after the pre-workout (which contains L-Citrulline DL-Malate, Caffeine, L-Arginine, and Beta-Alanine), I felt a sudden loss of energy in the body. It wasn't anything drastic, but a bit uncomfortable and unexpected. I was still able to complete the workout without much issue, but it took a significant amount of effort. I don't drink tea/coffee in general and never have my whole life. Pre-workout is something I've started only a few months ago as well.

Afterwards, I took creatine as I always do after a workout. I had a mild feeling of stomach upset and a general uncomfortable feeling for the rest of the day.

  
I can explain the loss of energy because I forgot to eat bananas for carbs before my workout, but I'm not sure about the stomach upset. 

  
I am curious to know if NAC is okay or considered safe when one's taking pre-workouts and creatine.",1,1756780067.0,Supplements,1,1.0,False

Work, an MBA, and life itself have taken me across five countries. I’ve loved every chapter of that adventure, but now I’m ready to build a cozy home - with the right person.

I’d love to meet someone in their 30s or 40s who’s thriving in their own career and personal life, and who’s also ready for a real, lasting partnership.

I’m a deeply feeling introvert who spends a lot of time on health, fitness (yes, I’m a bit of a fanatic and proud of being in great shape), nutrition, and spirituality-lately learning more about Advaita. I throw myself into the things I care about, whether that’s work, friendships, or simply living everyday life with intention. I’m equally comfortable debating world affairs, swapping travel stories, or laughing over something completely silly.

I also know that two people coming together to build a life isn’t easy. What makes it work, I believe, are respect, trust, and a lasting friendship to carry you through the tougher parts.

Who I imagine you to be:

You laugh easily, say funny things, and love when I do the same.
You are my BFF and do not roll your eyes when I use the term BFF.
You are damn smart – but not a snob about it. You are in love with life. Family comes first. 
You do not mistake my warmth, love, and affection for weakness.
You do what you love. You make the best of any situation.
You share your chips with me. You will come with me for walks. 
You love hard, fight fair, and balance modern independence with a touch of old-school kindness.
Compassion and generosity guide your choices, and you always try to see the best in people.
Simply put, you inspire me and are inspired by me. That’s the kind of bond I’m looking for—one that’s deep and supportive, but also light-hearted and adventurous.

So what say - shall we travel, smash patriarchy, cook healthy, work out often, make memories, and open our hearts and minds?

If this resonates with you-win me over with free-flowing conversations, deep enough to matter and spark thought, playful enough to see the humor in things. Hit me up if you'd like to grab a coffee, and/or fall in love and start naming the future dogs.",0,1756780014.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

I'm a 24 year old girl, and I'm looking for more people in my life to be able to talk to, and potentially become closer with to a point where we consider each other legitimate family and could maybe even get together for holidays and special occasions. It might take me a while to get to that point since I need a lot of extra time to build trust, but I would love nothing more!

I really want siblings to be able to be best friends with. I've always dreamed of having a younger brother, and I think it'd be amazing to have a sister near my age who thinks of me as a best friend too. More than anything though right now, I could really use some healthy parental (or aunt/uncle) relationships. I don't have a single adult that I look up to and can go to for advice or support, and that's been pretty rough on me.

A little about me is that I love being crafty! It's really fulfilling to me to make my loved ones gifts or cute little letters to brighten their day.

I also am an accomplished pianist. I love all sorts of styles of music, but I love to play studio ghibli music more than anything!

I love to be active in the ways that I can, but I'm struggling a lot with my health right now. I've been disabled for a few years and am still in search of answers. When I'm feeling well enough for it though, I love water aerobics, pickleball, foosball, ping pong, biking, hikes and soccer! I also love playing with little kids - I love engaging with them by trying to understand their make believe worlds and see things from their perspectives. It's really fulfilling to me!

I have adored video games for as long as I can remember - I especially love pokémon, webkinz, animal crossing, terraria, smash bros, rogue-likes, and pretty much any cutesy games you can think of! But I can also kick ass in shooter games too, if I'm given a minute to get the hang of it ;)

I also love anime, and have been (very slowly) learning Japanese! I'm also a big fan of doctor who as well. If I could meet any celebrity, it'd be David Tennant hands down 🤩

As far as my beliefs go, I care immensely about human and animal rights. I have been protesting as much as I can in the US to try and fight against all of the human rights violations that have been happening lately, especially in regards to people of color, LGBTQ+, and women. As far as religion goes, I don't believe in any or any god, and actually carry quite a bit of religious trauma due to having grown up in a cult.

One other important thing about me! I'm happily married to my best friend in the whole world. He's amazing, and should you get closer to me I'd also love for you to meet him at some point too! He's 26, currently is going to grad school, loves board games/video games, and coffee. We also have pet rats and pet beetles that we love more than anything ❤️

If you think that we might get along well or you want to get to know more about me to see if we might be a good fit, please reach out through DM! I feel like I have a lot of love in my heart that is just yearning for more places to go. Thanks for reading!",2,1756780002.0,FamiliesYouChoose,1,1.0,False

I (19M) met my girlfriend (18F) back in April after being recommended by a good buddy of mine. We were originally only suppose to be prom dates but we ended up liking eachother a lot and ended up getting together.

The first few months of our relationship were pretty normal. We had a good intimate connection, we shared a lot of quality time together, and overall things were pretty good. Or so I thought. Towards the end of June, I went swimming with her and quickly noticed something was off. Her overall demeanor and attitude towards me just didn't seem right. When we we're done swimming, I asked her if we could hangout for a little bit and she agreed. But here's the thing, she almost seemed annoyed. Like she didn't want to but is doing it anyway so she wouldn't hurt my feelings. We ended up going to a coffee shop and chatted for a while before parting ways. I laid in my bed that night worrying that I might have screwed something up or have accidentally pissed her off. I texted her the next morning and asked her if everything was okay and she said that she had a really rough week, to which I understood and gave her space. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this would officially mark the spot were things would start to go downhill.

As the days past and the month of July rolled through, she started to distance herself from me. Intimacy decreased and she no longer seemed like she wanted to spend time with me. There were numerous occasions where I made plans with her and she would end up cancelling on me last minute and go hangout with her friends instead. (There were a few times where we spent time together but I wouldn't necessarily call it quality time) I communicated with her about this and she said that she was going through a ""phase"". Essentially, she told me that she really wasn't feeling like herself and told me that she really needed space. To which I understood and respected. But things still weren't getting better. 

Last month came by and things were still the same, no intimacy, no quality time spent together, and a lot of emotional disconnection. However, when my girlfriend was on a family trip, she opened up to me and apologized for everything. I'll told her that it was okay and forgave her. But even after her apologizing, things still dont seem any better. 

I have no idea what to do. There were times were I thought things were starting to get better, but it would just end up relapsing. I've tried communicating with her but she doesn't seem committed. I mean, she's not perfect by any means. She has her flaws and I have mine, but at this point I'm just confused. I don't feel the spark we use to have anymore, and honestly I want to end the relationship, but a part of me wants to hang on and wait things out.

I’m a Twitch streamer as well, so I spend a lot of time around games and gaming culture. It would be awesome to meet people who share those interests, whether that’s cosplaying, checking out panels, wandering the show floor, or just hanging out and sharing the hype. I’d also love to keep in touch beyond PAX if we click, whether that’s going to other conventions, game nights, or just grabbing coffee.

If you’re also looking for someone to go with or even a small group, feel free to comment or DM. And again, if this isn’t the right way to find friends I’d really appreciate any advice on the best way to go about it.

And my first meal after ending it was a hard boiled egg and half a medium rare steak, a bit of spinach and some salted cashew nuts. I drank water, black coffee and caffeine free tea with vitamins in it while fasting with one powdered Hydroxycut drink (1g of carbs but vitamins in it). I might’ve broke the fast with the Hydroxycut but oh well first time! Would that break the fast? Also I tried eating low carbs to start eating again. However, my energy is not returning despite eating some more carbs since then so what should I do? Or is it just gradually building back up carbs and sugars that gives back your body’s energy? I heard that it is hard to work workout without fatigued while in a low carbs, high fat diet or keto diet so is that why it’s taking so long to feel normal? I worked out first day of fasting and was ok, but trying to today was tough and I gave up due to lack of energy.

1n67e47,https://i.redd.it/8g1ypt14tnmf1.jpeg,First Marathon - Very Humbling experience,"I did my first marathon (Sydney Marathon) on the weekend and I thought l'd like to share my experience and my learnings. I will be also doing the Melbourne one in 6 weeks time.

Goal was sub 3:40. Result was 4.39. My Garmin race predictor said I should be able to do in 3.44. The TLDR is I went out too hard, didn't respect the distance and challenge and blew up big time. It was one of the biggest lessons for me in humility and arrogance.

Background and Preparation- Me (M in early 40s), 1 followed the program for full throttle- experienced runner program from the book ""Run your best marathon"" by Sam Murphy. I followed it pretty much to the tee. I also added 3 days of strength training each week (2 days upper body/core and 1 day lower body) during the week. Prior to the training block I ran about 16-20km a week with 4 days strength training and 1 rest day. I maintained this one day rest day for the marathon training block. Generally the long easy runs (20 to 32km were run at pace of 6-6:20 per km and I felt fine afterwards and day after. Little sore but not limping like I am now.

Nutrition- I generally eat relatively healthily but I have kids so there's the occasional bad meals out.
The lead up days to event I ate 2 pieces of white sourdough and coffee for breakfast each day.

Marathon morning- I went to bed at 830pm abd woke up at around 4am. I slept pretty well. late 2 pieces of sourdough toast with peanut butter and jam per usual. I skipped the coffee but had a water with an electrolyte tablet (Gu brand).

Marathon- arrived on time. I brought along 8
Maurten 100 gels for the race. I felt physically pretty prepared for the distance apart from some minor niggles.

Mistake 1 (and looking back was probably a very very major mistake) was not respecting the distance and ignoring advice from books and reddit about starting slow. Everywhere I read, I saw people doing sub 3:40 marathon times on their first attempts etc.
Really I should have ran my own race. The first 10km I went out and ran high 4s and low 5 min kms.
I felt pretty comfortable. I was still feeling ok by 21km mark. Albeit by this point I was slowing to a more target pace thinking I could just maintain this pace to the end at my easy running pace. Personally I think my nutrition was fine I had a gel every 30min at this point and had half to most the cup of Powerade every 5km.

Mentally. I was in a pretty good groove at around 10-15km. By 21km mark I was feeling ok but mentally I hurt thinking I had depleted 70% of my energy and need to slow down significantly if I could finish this without walking. by 28km mark my mind was thinking each step each step. My legs were really heavy and there were moments I was really regretting signing up for this marathon and also the next one in Melbourne. I was in a personal state of self pity. At this point this is also where I started cramping up and had to walk certain parts to walk of the cramps. The hill at the end was excruciating and I had to jog the last bit because my family were waiting near the end and I didn’t want them see me waking.

By the end of the race I was so relieved it had finished I am happy to the extent to say I finished it. Disappointed that I didn’t heed to advice and be more realistic with my own body expectations and limits. 2 days after I am still limping. From my long runs in training I didn’t limp day after. I will rest until the weekend and slowly get back and taper for Melbourne. I will aim for 4-4:10hr. For the more experienced should I seek the 4:10 pacer or pace my own race at this 4hr 4:10hr target pace.

To add to the humility, I bought carbon shoes which I practiced twice before for the race and still failed miserably. A true mascot for All the gear no idea!
I thought l'd share the story because there are heaps of stories inspiring success. This is one where I was humbled and was big lesson. I will definitely start the next marathon (in 6 weeks) at a lot easy pace and hopefully achieve a better result.",30,1756778727.0,Marathon_Training,8,1.0,False

The reason you feel trapped isn't because nicotine “gives” you pleasure. It’s because it steals your dopamine and leaves you in a deficit, then it partially corrects that deficit.

https://preview.redd.it/eroz6p3vsnmf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e69a58d7e44a86cbcf210a85fe18a1548418247

When you quit, your brain doesn’t stay broken. It heals. Baseline Dopamine rebounds. Motivation returns. Joy comes back. The so-called “sacrifice” is nothing but the removal of a leash.

The Nicotine Cartel made billions (actually, trillions over decades) convincing us the opposite. They didn’t just sell cigarettes and vapes—they sold hypnosis. They planted anchors in your brain: light equals relief, smoke equals calm, vape equals focus, snus, chewing, whatever. Lies. Pure conditioning. They hijacked your nervous system like magicians performing a cheap trick, spending more on marketing in the US alone ($8–9 billion in 2023) than the government spent on cancer research.

https://preview.redd.it/0ajsf6yvsnmf1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=e45a0c472867a4eed672e4bd9164217303b45632

And if a trick put you here, a trick can set you free. The same principles—mental reprogramming, breaking associations, rewriting the script—are weapons in your hands now. What they hypnotized you into believing, you can hypnotize yourself out of.

Science backs it. Quitters show dopamine function recovering within weeks. Brain scans prove it. (Reuters, 2016) Nicotine isn’t medicine. It isn’t therapy. It’s classified as a neurotoxin that rewires your reward system. Reviews call it one of the most addictive, least beneficial drugs on Earth (WHO, 2021). Chronic use disrupts your DANS system (dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin)—the molecules behind motivation, focus, mood stability, and emotional resilience. It creates a ""molecular happiness deficit,"" dialing down your natural production through homeostasis (your body's balance mechanism). Every puff spikes dopamine artificially, but your brain compensates by producing less naturally, leaving you in a constant low.

Think of it like a happiness scale: Non-users live at a steady 8/10. Nicotine drops your baseline to 6.5 or lower over time. That ""relief"" from a smoke or vape? It's just bumping you back to 7 for a moment—not real pleasure, but escape from the dip the drug caused. True pleasure is a walk on the beach, laughing with friends, or deep sleep—whole, vibrant, and free of crashes.

The Cartel built this illusion on four pillars: distorting reality (ads making it look cool), ritual belonging (passed down socially), mental reservations (""It helps me relax""—no, it creates tension then relieves it), and classical conditioning (Pavlovian triggers like coffee or stress dropping dopamine in anticipation). But once you see it, it dies.

Cravings? 90% placebo, 100% beatable. They're not real needs—they're echoes of old loops. Use tools like B.R.E.A.T.H. (Breathe deeply, Recognize the truth, Engage physically, Activate natural rewards, Transcend the trigger, Hold the line) to hack them. No willpower required, just awareness.

From a neuropsychiatrist's view: ""Chronic nicotine exposure leads to adaptation of the dopaminergic system, reducing receptor sensitivity or even lowering dopamine production"" (Goldberg et al., 1991). Smokers have 30-40% less MAO activity, disrupting serotonin and norepinephrine (Fowler et al., 2003). Long-term quitters report less depression than when they smoked (U.S. Dept. of Health, 1990).

So here’s the truth: Quitting isn’t losing anything. It’s gaining back everything. Clarity. Energy. Presence. Real happiness. Every craving is the cartel’s ghost whispering in your ear. Every cigarette or vape is paying rent to an enemy living in your brain. The day you stop is the day you evict them.

You don’t need willpower to quit. You need truth. Once you see nicotine for what it is—a fraud hijacking your molecular happiness—the illusion collapses. And when it collapses, you don’t fight—you walk free.

This is not a sacrifice. This is victory. This is dopamine sovereignty.

1n679eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1n679eu/breaking_the_chains_engineered_dopamine_deficit/,"Breaking the Chains: Engineered Dopamine deficit Is the real prison, and It’s Reversible","I want you to realize something most people never see. The reason u feel trapped isn't because nicotine “gives” you pleasure. It’s because it steals your dopamine and leaves you in a deficit, then it partially corrects that deficit.



https://preview.redd.it/7ufq54uwrnmf1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fd789a81d724d6b823e40702a00d94b4bc8c552

When you quit, your brain doesn’t stay broken. It heals. Baseline Dopamine rebounds. Motivation returns. Joy comes back. The so-called “sacrifice” is nothing but the removal of a leash.

The Nicotine Cartel made billions (actually, trillions over decades), convincing us the opposite. They didn’t just sell cigarettes and vapes—they sold hypnosis. They planted anchors in your brain: light equals relief, smoke equals calm, vape equals focus, snus, chewing, whatever. Lies. Pure conditioning. They hijacked your nervous system like magicians performing a cheap trick, spending more on marketing in the US alone ($8–9 billion in 2023) than the government spent on cancer research.



https://preview.redd.it/g38zf1hyrnmf1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebd3b1f9c43fb9bff43d0ca633311ee6e83cb681

And if a trick put you here, a trick can set you free. The same principles—mental reprogramming, breaking associations, rewriting the script—are weapons in your hands now. What they hypnotized you into believing, you can hypnotize yourself out of.

Science backs it. Quitters show dopamine function recovering within weeks. Brain scans prove it. (Reuters, 2016) Nicotine isn’t medicine. It isn’t therapy. It’s classified as a neurotoxin that rewires your reward system. Reviews call it one of the most addictive, least beneficial drugs on Earth (WHO, 2021). Chronic use disrupts your DANS system (dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin)—the molecules behind motivation, focus, mood stability, and emotional resilience. It creates a ""molecular happiness deficit,"" dialing down your natural production through homeostasis (your body's balance mechanism). Every puff spikes dopamine artificially, but your brain compensates by producing less naturally, leaving you in a constant low.

Think of it like a happiness scale: Non-users live at a steady 8/10. Nicotine drops your baseline to 6.5 or lower over time. That ""relief"" from a smoke or vape? It's just bumping you back to 7 for a moment—not real pleasure, but escape from the dip the drug caused. True pleasure is a walk on the beach, laughing with friends, or deep sleep—whole, vibrant, and free of crashes.

The Cartel built this illusion on four pillars: distorting reality (ads making it look cool), ritual belonging (passed down socially), mental reservations (""It helps me relax""—no, it creates tension then relieves it), and classical conditioning (Pavlovian triggers like coffee or stress dropping dopamine in anticipation). But once you see it, it dies.

Cravings? 90% placebo, 100% beatable. They're not real needs—they're echoes of old loops. Use tools like B.R.E.A.T.H. (Breathe deeply, Recognize the truth, Engage physically, Activate natural rewards, Transcend the trigger, Hold the line) to hack them. No willpower required, just awareness.

From a neuropsychiatrist's view: ""Chronic nicotine exposure leads to adaptation of the dopaminergic system, reducing receptor sensitivity or even lowering dopamine production"" (Goldberg et al., 1991). Smokers have 30-40% less MAO activity, disrupting serotonin and norepinephrine (Fowler et al., 2003). Long-term quitters report less depression than when they smoked (U.S. Dept. of Health, 1990).

So here’s the truth: Quitting isn’t losing anything. It’s gaining back everything. Clarity. Energy. Presence. Real happiness. Every craving is the cartel’s ghost whispering in your ear. Every cigarette or vape is paying rent to an enemy living in your brain. The day you stop is the day you evict them.

You don’t need willpower to quit. You need truth. Once you see nicotine for what it is—a fraud hijacking your molecular happiness—the illusion collapses. And when it collapses, you don’t fight—you walk free.

This is not a sacrifice. This is victory. This is dopamine sovereignty.

**The 10 Promises of Freedom (from my journey breaking free):**

1. You Will Transcend Cravings, without force or fear.
2. You Will Sharpen Your Mind, naturally, and powerfully.
3. You Will Rediscover Joy in living, in breathing, in being.
4. You Will Breathe with Power because your lungs are free.
5. You Will Radiate Vitality from the inside out.
6. You Will Strengthen Your Heart emotionally and physically.
7. You Will Reclaim Your True Self, bold, clear, awake, strong, and powerful.
8. You Will Sleep Deeply.
9. You Will Shatter False Beliefs and see through the addiction’s illusion.
10. You Will Live Free because nothing owns you anymore.

Where do I go from here?,"My \[24F\] boyfriend \[25m\] and I have been together for 4 years now. He is nothing but the best in every sense and gets along really well with my family, my friends and everyone recognizes he is an amazing partner. Recently, we had a trip coming up so I was using his phone to look up flight details in our messages. When I looked up my name, I saw messages with one of his best friends \[25m\], let's call him A where the two of them were talking shit about me and A's girlfriend. For context, A's girlfriend is verbally abusive towards him and believes that men should pay for everything despite making 3x A's salary.

These messages range from A and my bf complaining about how I and A's girlfriend never pay for anything despite wanting to go out all the time and spend money on ""$10 coffees"", and talking about how many times we have used our cards a particular day. In our relationship, we always take turns paying with my bf covering bigger expenses as I am still in school while he's working but I always assumed we had no problem with our finances. Another example was recently my bf and I had an argument which my bf vented to A about which I understand is completely normal but A proceeds to tell my bf that I am emotionally immature and would have no problem finding a new girlfriend. Another instance is A's gf is terrible at keeping friends and my bf chimes in by saying if it wasn't for my high school friends, all of the other people in my life are his friends. This hurts the most because we always take pride in having a shared circle of friends who love the both of us equally. Around the same time, I was really sad about not getting into grad school and my bf vents to A about how much it was annoying him that I was so sad. All of these are really hurtful because my bf is nothing but supportive to me and holds me to a really high regard. And all of these messages only started once A started dating his gf and began venting about her.

However, I feel like under the guise of being a good friend and making A feel better about his shitty relationship, my bf would make me come off as a bad gf too. I am not sure if this is a naive interpretation of this. I spoke to my bf regarding this and he hasn't stopped crying since and feels really bad that I had to read all that and states he was just joking to make his friend feel better. I understand with the guys paying for thing could pass as banter. However, I feel some of the comments from him were unwarranted and worse than what A was saying about his gf. I am really upset with him of course and told him that he has no loyalty towards me and that because someone else has a bad girlfriend, doesn't mean I am a bad girlfriend as well. Especially when my name is being dragged into a conversation where A's girlfriend is verbally abusive toward him, I can't even fathom calling my partner names. I am not sure where to go from here, I really thought I would marry my bf and I love him so dearly, there is no one else out there for me. But I am not sure how to properly move on from this situation and what the right kind of conversations look like so there is steps to improving us.

**TL;DR:** Found texts between my boyfriend and his best friend where my boyfriend is speaking poorly of me. He insists he was joking to make his friend feel better, but I feel betrayed and hurt. Not sure how to rebuild trust or move forward.

We've been in the Pico & Crenshaw area of Mid-City since then. I am a school teacher & he does crew work, so the price of the neighborhood is right. 

I have really put a concerted effort into forming or joining a community here, but I'm white and my Spanish is meh, so nobody comes when I invite them to our backyard BBQs, and no one is inviting us to theirs. There are no pubs, no Parks, no community classes, no bike lanes, and what's been the hardest of all, no nature.  

We have friends in Venice, friends in Long Beach, friends in in silver lake/highland Park, and friends in Pasadena. We would be so happy to live by any of them, but the hardest thing about leaving a central location is knowing that Westside people rarely go east, and east side people rarely go west. 

(That, and we've been grandfathered into rent control because of our roommates who have lived in the house for 9 years. So it's a real golden handcuffs situation. Meaning if we're going to move and incur a big rent jump, I want to make sure it's the RIGHT move.)

Heres what we value:
- nature
- art for the sake of making art (not money)
- live music and comedy 
- community/down to earth people  
- hiking/biking trails (or groups!) 
- trivia nights / pubs / coffee shops with a community feel
- less sirens / car alarms / dogs barking for 10 solid hours 
- still relatively close to the film studios (Long Beach feels like it might be too much of a stretch)
- would it be asking too much to still have a backyard??? 
- still affordable on our blue collar paychecks
- trees. Please. It would mean so much to me. 

So that's the ask. Do we go east or west? Or am I living in a dream world and this list is simply not something that's available to the common (wo)man in LA? ",7,1756778054.0,MovingToLosAngeles,5,0.89,False

I just finished refining my Data Analyst resume after months of feedback, trial, and error. I wanted to share it here because I know how tough the job search can be, especially for recent grads or those pivoting into analytics.

Some key things I learned while building this:

* Keep it one page and prioritize measurable outcomes (%, $, #) throughout the whole resume.
* Lead every bullet with tool → action → business/people impact rather than technicality.
* Highlight Cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform), multiple data sources (CRM, ERP, or anywhere), SQL, Python, Data Visualization tools such as (Power BI, Tableau, AWS QuickSight, Google Sheets, Excel, Google Sheets, PowerPoint),  wherever possible since recruiters look for those keywords. 
* Frame projects and leadership as analyst case studies by showing *data → insights → impact*.
* Get experience wherever you can: volunteering, student orgs, community projects — then reframe that work into data-driven achievements.
* Be intentional: show how you use data tools to deliver insights that improve decision-making and community outcomes. In my case, I built expertise in education programs as I am a subject matter expert.
* Utilize AI to verify that your resume, values, and vibe will match their team. 
* Leverage local and college career centers for networking events, alumni network, employment resources, and information. I was able to net 40 interviews since beginning of August with not-so-polished resume until now.
* Remember that recruiters and hiring managers have less than 10 seconds to skim the resume so you better have keywords, metrics, and impact loaded to get them invested. 
* For interviewing, make sure you walk them through the resume like you are reading a children's book to them. If they do not vibe with you, then it's a team you do not want to be part of. Save your misery to a team where you can thrive.
* Continue learning and asking valuable feedback.

Hopefully this gives others an idea of how to structure theirs and alongside be successful in a career search. Feedback always welcome!",1,1756777685.0,dataanalysiscareers,0,1.0,False

I'm 33(M), and have been single for.. getting close to 3 years now. I've not been looking particularly actively in that time as I was focused on my own mental health and enjoying life, sorting out buying my own place, etc. I'm relatively successful etc, and I think that most people that meet me legitimately enjoy my company.

But I have had online dating profiles up, and I made the mistake of making a data request to bumble. It's.. fucking brutal.

I'm not some homunculus. I might not be Ryan Reynolds, but people other than my mum have called me handsome. My profile mostly just described how I like both cats and dogs as pets and enjoy spontaneous things like going horseback riding in the mountains in Wales - with pictures that try and showcase that side of me.

I thought that maybe it's just the algorithm not showing me to people.. But no.. apparently 98.8% of people that my profile is shown to simply swipe no outright.

I had 3 different female friends help me with picking pictures. I had them tell me off for being stupid with some of my jokes and how I describe my job (because apparently just saying ""Project Manager"" gets people's backs up).

And yet... 98.8% rejection rate, before I even take into account all the ""follow me on snapchat!"" bots, scammers and so forth.

I know the advice is really ""get off the apps, and go and do something with people in real life"". And yeah, went to do archery over the weekend, met a lovely Hungarian lady that I wanted to invite out for a coffee and instead I just.. panicked and bailed, partially because of this being in my head.

Like, how do I convince myself that it's worth putting myself out there when nearly 3 years of data tells me women just aren't interested?",2,1756777484.0,UKrelationshipadvice,0,1.0,False

Quick back story, after years of casually playing I wanted to take Golf more seriously and finally took lessons. Since then I feel like I've been improving every round, went from averaging 105 to hitting mid 90s over the last 2 months. 

Back to today.. early tee time, barely had time for a cup of coffee, first hole was rough. Let's just say I built a snow man in September. After that though, my god I hit a groove. I was playing the best golf of my life, at one point I parred 5 holes in a row, which I've never done before. Even though I missed a couple birdie putts along the way it was amazing. Every bad tee shot was followed by an incredible recovery shot, my 56° wegde was a miracle tool, anything under 100 yards and it put me within 10 feet of the cup. I was feeling euphoric..

Then it all fell apart.. 17th hole, not my worst tee shot but pulled it left into a fairway bunker.  7 iron hit the lip of the bunker and went straight up, landed maybe 20 feet in front of me. All of a sudden I started topping every shot. Boom. Triple bogey out of no where. Brought that negative energy to the 18th and continued to top every shot. Tripled that hole as well. 

I just think it's wild that I went from playing my best golf to forgetting how to swing a club in the blink of an eye. I thought for sure today was gonna be the day I broke 90 and all of a sudden I suck again. 

I should be happy about hitting a personal best but damn, the way it ended was brutal and has completely shook my confidence.",2,1756777312.0,golf,2,0.67,False

It eventually grew to the point where with my eyes open I couldn't see anything. I continue to stay calm and moved my hands infornt of myself without being able to see them. I started to see the hallow outline of my hand and then it happend. It was like a million tiny lightning bolts covering my hands, blue in color moving in all directions.

1n66qms,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDevilsArchive/comments/1n66qms/few_bits_of_foreshadowing_and_symbolism_in_the/,Few bits of foreshadowing and symbolism in the book,"A few bits of foreshadowing/extra meaning that you guys may not have picked up on! 🧐 😁

>Phi Tharn, with his strong arms and daring eyes, never ran away from anything.

>Except for spiders, Tara remembered. Phi Tharn always made her kill the spiders.

Basically foreshadowing from the prologue itself that Tara will kill the Spiderweaver that scared/hurt Tharn (butterfly).

>“Woah!” Tharn jerked upright as the ground shuddered below his feet. The air crackled, and static rushed through his ears. His vision went white, as if a torchlight blinded his eyes, and for a split second, a terrible, sharp pain tore through his gut. 

The way Tharn sometimes felt a sharp pain in his gut - foreshadowing the way he's later stabbed.

>Mr Harris stood with a set jaw. “We worked hard all our lives. I’d come home covered with dye from that blasted factory, tired down to my bones, and my wife would welcome me with a smile and a warm dinner.”

>Mrs Harris gave a tearful laugh and batted his arm. “Don’t you be forgetting about how I washed your uniforms every night.” 

It's not directly mentioned in the book, but workers in dye manufacturing factories have a high risk of bladder cancer. Mrs Harris likely got bladder cancer from washing the dye from Mr Harris's uniforms.

>“My sister loves King Arthur,” Tharn said. “Though we get into arguments about the morality of killing people with a sword given to you by a lake fairy.”

This is from when Tharn is chatting with Ms Cain about how Tara likes stories about King Author. Kinda foreshadowing how in the climax, Tara later gets the scalpel from the pond and kills with it.

>“Phi.” Tara was wildly shaking a bell Tharn recognised from Mae’s prayer place. “Phi, we’ve got to go.” 

Tara was following her mother's instructions about how a bell's resonance (according to Buddhist and Hindu traditions) can repel evil spirits. But Tara doesn't know here that the preta is not an evil spirit - just a misguided one trying to keep the other spirits contained within her to stop *'it'* from warping them.

>Mr Harris’s confusion was clear. He said gruffly, “Why don’t I get you a coffee, and you tell me more?”

>“No, sir.” Tharn stepped back. “A consultant is waiting to speak to me. Just—” He hesitated. “Just stop smoking before it kills you.”

Tharn warns Mr Harris to stop smoking. Seventeen years later, Mr Harris dies from metastatic stomach cancer, most likely caused from smoking. Unfortunately, a lot of people of his generation were unaware of the risks of smoking when they first started. And once addicted, it can be very difficult to stop.

>""One of our DCI's—DCI Panganiban—has taken charge of this case."" DI Skelton lowered his gaze. “She has recommended to the CPS that no charges be brought against Tara or Beam. She’s also keen to release the body to you as soon as possible. We’ll let you know once it’s confirmed.” He sighed. “And I really am. Sorry.”

Not really a foreshadowing - but a sneak peek of 3rd book's main character!

>In the hall’s corner, stood a white-flowered wreath sent by a Korean company Tara had never heard of before.

And another sneak peek here of the 4th book's main character! 😆

the strangers who become friends,
the friends who become family
for a night, a meal, a dance.

I want the company of people,
their stories spilling over coffee,
their joy echoing in music,
their presence reminding me
that life is never meant
to be lived in silence.

No gold, no crowns,

shared and alive.

I was rushed to an ER, and they found that my BP was 90/60 (I do have lower BP on average, but kept it in check with food/coffee most of my life). The temperature and EKG were ""fine"". I was given an infusion (not sure what was in it?) and sent home to ""hydrate and rest to get over the infection"".   
  
I was feeling a bit better the next day (the BP remained around 90/60, even though I drank a lot of fluids, coffee, and struggled to eat, so I ate small, often, and only extremely salty food), but the day after felt very close to fainting. Went to the ER, given another infusion, they took my blood for analysis - rinse and repeat, sent home to hydrate and rest. Instead, I went to a private clinic, they glanced at my blood results, and agreed that resting and hydrating is all they can tell me.  
  
After several more days of low blood pressure (feeling like fainting all the time, BP hanging around 90/60 no matter the coffee and salty meals), pain in the upper neck and back, no appetite, I went to the GP. They took my blood and urine sample, did an EKG, and told me I have an asymptomatic UTI (E.Coli). I had no symptoms of UTI, except a high percentage of leukocytes in my urine and a stone-like feeling in my stomach.   
  
They gave me an antibiotic (ciprofloksacin, 500mg 2x a day) and a probiotic. I'm on day three of the antibiotic. They told me that my BP is affected by my kidneys, which are struggling due to the UTI. They did no additional tests.  
  
Since starting it, my temperature (which has returned to normal) is now hanging below, or exactly at 36C. I often get chills and tremors. I feel either tingling, numbness, or actual pain in my extremities, and while my BP is occasionally going up to 100/70, I still often feel like fainting. Eating is still a struggle. Rehydrating constantly with sports drinks as instructed.   
  
Went to the private clinic again today because I couldn't warm up and felt like fainting (could not see the original GP due to paperwork issues), and was told that my recent fainting-like feeling was due to stress, and that I have to wait longer for the antibiotics to work. Given a vitamin infusion. I was advised to visit a psychotherapist at the clinic(even though I do have weekly sessions with my therapist).    
  
Does this diagnosis (reasoning) make sense, or should I look for a third opinion? I hate to doubt the diagnosis, and I feel bad for even writing here, but I'm exhausted. It's been two weeks of feeling like I'm about to faint and forcing myself to eat with no appetite. I am very stressed at this point by random pains/numbness in my extremities, and by still not feeling better (except for those few hours after infusions). 

I'd really appreciate your input on all this. Thank you for any advice you can spare!",1,1756776044.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1n66eik,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/comments/1n66eik/my_story_its_quite_long/,My story. (It’s quite long.),"I (24F) am the B. My WW is (26M) and currently in the military. We are both Christian. I had three D-days, back to back which wrecked me all differently and each felt like they were chipping away at my heart, soul, and mind. For context, my husband and I were apart for about a month when the infidelity took place. He was at his duty station, and I was planning on moving out to be with him. During this time, many things took place, and I had zero clue. 

We have been married for 3 years, together for 6. 
He just joined the military a few months ago. We knew it was going to be a change, and had heard of the stories of military couples being unfaithful to one another. We had a conversation, stating if one of us was going to cheat, to let the other know ahead of time, and we can get a divorce so they can go be stupid without hurting the other. 
He finished boot camp, graduated, and headed to his new station where he would be training for his job. We planned on waiting for the military to move me out, but we decided it was better for us to be together so instead i’d be coming out sooner than anticipated. 

Cue to, the infidelity. 
The first one, was with a young woman, thinking and being convinced by my husband he was interested in her, and that he was single even though most knew he had a wife. I just don’t think they cared. She had never been with anyone, and she asked him, if this was just a one time thing, or if they would actually develop into something more. He lies, and they have sex. Unprotected. She takes a plan b. They don’t talk anymore. Second one, was with another young woman, who knew he had a wife, but wanted to hook up. One hook up led to multiple, to them saying I love you, to them pretty much dating, “making love”, talking of him divorcing me and marrying her, again, having sex unprotected, and talking of a future together. This is all in a month span. 

Cue to my first D-day. We had been apart just a little over a month. He mentions a “friend” who he is helping, and they have been texting. Keep in mind, I don’t text males, and he doesn’t text females. We just don’t do this. I ask him how long this has been going on, he says a week. I ask if there is anything going on, because this was out of character for him, and he says, “she told me she has feelings for me.” I immediately shut it down, and tell him to stop texting her and to let her know they wouldn’t be able to text anymore, as well as blocking her number. He tells me he does it. I have this feeling of, if she feels comfortable saying that, then other stuff must have happened because you don’t just have feelings and tell them that unless that door is opened for you to do that, especially someone married. I’m upset, and tell him i feel disrespected, that he doesn’t care about me as much as her seeing as he didn’t block her or shut it down until i said so, and that I wouldn’t let this happen again. We reconcile, and I move my whole life across the country for him. Move into our new place. Great right? 

Second D-Day. 
A few days after I moved out, I can tell there is a disconnect between us. We get into an argument about me not doing enough for him. How I need to be spontaneous, be there more for him, he’s not happy in our marriage, etc. A huge blow to me, but whatever. He’s barely touching me, is acting weird, all the stuff. One night we have a talk. Apparently they’ve been texting and talking for a few weeks. She feels horrible about being the other woman, she’s been getting him food and coffee, they’ve been hanging out, she “cares”, she’s interesting, she’s just this amazing girl who other men have tried to take advantage of, and he’s been there for her to help and look out for. He says he’s been considering divorce, and isn’t sure if he loves me or wants to be with me, and struggles to be intimate and touch me. I’m obviously broken, seeing the man who is supposed to care for me, love and speak so highly of another woman in a way he never has treated me. I break down, cry, tell him I want to try and stay together, we have sex, and go to bed. I’m hollow. A shell. And then the dam breaks. His phone pings, and he’s asleep. I get up, check it, and i decide to check his text messages. In the recently deleted, there is a massive text thread with this number. I click on it, and boom, there it is. The sex. What they did while hooking up. I love yous. Talking about me, and how they were going to get married. Being able to never forget her. I mean you name it, it was there. And what I thought, was just an emotional affair, turned out to be worse. Time and time again, he disregarded me, and chose her. I wake him up, we fight, he says i’m being crazy, and I’m made to feel bad for his infidelity. He asks me what I want to do, and I don’t even know. I’m just exhausted and tired. 

Third D-day. 
After about a month of us struggling to put the pieces back together, him defending her when I brought it up, and us just struggling to reconnect, or even know if we wanted to stay together, me thinking they haven’t seen each other, her being blocked on his phone, and him having been gone for a month for a job for the military, he returns home. Declares he’s in love with me, and only me. Is ready to move forward. Sounds good. I’m still struggling, and don’t know if I can trust him. I have no peace. And a couple days later, I check his phone again. Instead I go on his messaging app where his military stuff is texted, and there it is. Messages between them. While him and I were together. Messages from the beginning of their interactions all the way until she left to another state. Times they met up behind my back, while i slept alone in our apartment. Times they had sex while he couldn’t stomach touching me. Another blow. Evidence from not just this affair, but the evidence of the other woman he had a one night stand with, and lied about when I asked. I text his AP, and she offers to answer any questions, tries to put the blame all on him, and gets short when I call her out on her behavior. I drop the bomb that he hooked up with another woman before her, who just so happened to be her best friend and roommate, and that pretty much finishes that conversation. I again, wake him up, we have a big blow out, i’m being made to seem as though I can’t let stuff go, and again, he won’t admit to anything. I just grow tired, and go to sleep. 

It’s been about 3 months. I am a shell of who I used to be. I care about him, but i’m not in love with him anymore. I don’t know where he begins and I end. I don’t recognize myself when I look in the mirror, and I am drowning. My faith, my identity, and my self, seemed to all disappeared, and I am just there, numb. If I sit for too long, I hurt. And I can only distract myself so much before I’m hit in the face with all of the things that happened. Truth is, I struggle with the what if’s, and the truth of the matter. Truth is, he didn’t come out with any of it. I found out. Truth is, he didn’t put a stop to it and neither did she, she just moved away. Truth is, he chose me because she left. Truth is, anything I asked him to do concerning her, he never did. What if she was still here? What if I never read the messages or confronted him? What if I hadn’t come out sooner? These are what I struggle with, and I won’t ever have closure on them. I struggle with suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, not wanting to eat, struggling to sleep, numbness. I can do my best when we are together to try and love him, but i can’t say I love you first. I can’t honestly say I am in love with him. I can’t kiss him without aching. I can’t be intimate without thinking of all they did, and how she is better. I can’t walk or think or see the world without hearing all the things he spoke to me and told her. I don’t feel I am enough. I don’t feel wanted. I don’t feel safe in sharing my emotions with him. I don’t want children with him. I hate what happened, and how it has utterly destroyed me. I hate that even through all of this, i’m dependent upon him. I hate that I don’t want to leave him, even though I can’t stand to see him sometimes, or think of him, or look at memories of us before. Everything feels tainted, and I feel like every single piece of me that had value, has been murdered by this action. 

I share all of this, to say, adultery sucks. I don’t know how to begin to have joy again, or smile without aches, or be a wife after this. I want reconciliation, and I know it takes effort and work. 
But when I think of it all, I am wrecked, and my body shakes, and my heart feels like it will collapse. I know every position, every word shared, every thing that happened. And I can’t share this with family or friends because I don’t want them to view him in a bad light, especially because we are in a new place, and it’s just embarrassing. I really do care about him, and he has been trying. But, I don’t know how to live. Or even want to live. I hurt myself while we were apart, and he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know I’ve had dreams of this. He doesn’t know I want to die. And as crazy as it is, I can’t leave him. He’s my best friend, and he really is a great guy. And even though when I am alone, and think of all this, when I get around others, i talk about him, and our memories. I talk highly of him, and he’s always on my tongue. He’s put the effort forth, and he has tried, and is continuing to try. And that…. makes me feel like I again am the problem. 

I so badly want to disappear, and just fade away as far as possible so he can be happy, and just have a full life. Like this song says i’ve been listening to, 
“I have a feeling you got everything you wanted, and you’re not wasting time stuck here like me. You’re just thinking it’s a small thing that happened, The world ended when it happened to me.”

Thank you for listening to me. ❤️‍🩹",4,1756775860.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,17,0.7,False

It was an emergency as I was about to start pushing, baby was presenting a sideways face, and no one at the hospital to turn it. 

Anyway, all my other babies and this one were exclusively breastfed, and I didn't get my period until after a year in all cases. 

I am now 37 and not sure if it made a difference or the c-section. 

My baby is growing fine. He's big, but maybe not as fat as my others. I will say he got constipated unlike my others and I am certainly on a much different diet. 

I am on an animal based diet, so carnivore. Not always keto. I do include other foods at times, especially fruit, as I feel necessary. I definitely ate lots more gluten and other foods in oregnancy and immediately after delivery because I did NOT want redhead and couldn't stomach ground beef. Recently I have been VERY happy to eat ground beef, so I do that, and I let myself have a cup of fruit if I am in the mood. I am moving further away from dairy because I think it's inflammatory for me and I have stage 1 lipedema. I will probably always do 1-2 oz cream or half and half with coffee if or when I drink coffee.

I want to also say I am concerned about my hormones even though my thyroid complete panel tested good a month or so ago. But I din't have estrogen, prolactin, testosterone, etc. tested. 

And for a few weeks now, my feet hut every time I stand up and start moving and I have a frozen shoulder, both of which I heard can go along with menopause or perimenopause. 

But I would thing menopause or perimenopause would STOP my periods not increase them. I have heard that estrogen is required for prolactin, which is the hormone necessary to sustain breastfeeding and stops the period. And so now I'm wondering if this is an estrogen issue???

I am not hard-core exercising. I want to be walking at least an hour a day, but because I get swelling with it and had erythema nodusum after I had the baby, which is inflamed fat in the legs that becomes more inflamed with movement, I am taking exercise slow.

1n66cmk,https://www.reddit.com/r/hemorrhoid/comments/1n66cmk/postcircumferential_stapled_hemorrhoidectomy_a/,Post-Circumferential Stapled Hemorrhoidectomy - A good result story!,"Hey folks,

**TL;DR:** Had 'Roids, was mega-embarrassed, saw a doctor, had them stapled and removed, life is great now.

After reading so many horror stories and unanswered questions about the topic of stapling procedures for hemorrhoids, I thought I would add my 2 cents worth and try to allay any fears that others may have.

I am currently 4 days post operative and things have turned a corner for me. My recovery is going slowly but I am getting and feeling better each day. This is in stark contrast for having live with Grade 3 Hem's for the last 2-3 years. Words cannot describe the joy of having a BM and not feeling a bubble of my own flesh protruding from my bum and not seeing any blood in the toilet bowl!

I suffered in silence for way too long and it was getting to the point where I just did not know what to do about it anymore. Between the constant feeling of something protruding from my behind, the blood in the toilet bowl post BM and constantly checking where I had been sitting to make sure I wasn't leaving any mess, I'd finally had enough. I pulled on the big-boy pants and took myself to a specialist.

The first visit to the specialist was a Q+A about the condition, how long I had been suffering, the symptoms, my diet/exercise etc and then a full anal examination. Having someone back there with a clear plastic tube expanding the anal opening was an experience, but the Doctor was respectful and explained my situation without making me feel uneasy. He told me what I already knew and that I was a prime candidate for the stapling procedure, due to the size and location of the Hems. He referred me to a colleague of his who has performed the operation over 2000 times and I got booked in. He also referred me for a colonoscopy at the same time, and since I am mid-50's and hadn't yet had one, I thought it was a good idea.

The day before surgery, I had to take part in the colonoscopy protocol of cleaning out the digestive tract with the worlds worst laxative. Ple3ased to report it washed almost 2kg's of gunk out of my system! I then headed to the hospital for the procedures and was admitted.

The colonoscopy and surgery took about 45 minutes and after being put to sleep, I woke in the recovery room and a nurse provided me with a cup of water to drink as I came around. As I began to recover from the effects from the anesthetic, the surgeon came by to tell me the colonoscopy was clear and that the surgery went well. I was placed in the secondary recovery room for an hour for monitoring before being released to my partner to drive me home. I was discharged with scripts for an antibiotic, Voltaren (anti-inflammatory) Mersyndol Forte (paracetamol and codeine), Oxycodone and Movicol (stool softener) which I purchased on the way home. 

Night of the operation: The effects of the anesthetic wore off gradually and I felt a small amount of pain/achy feeling. I dosed up on the antibiotic, Mersyndol and Voltaren and had a relatively good sleep.

Day One: Pain and pressure was at about a 4-5/10 early on, but subsided to a 2-3/10 after my morning medications (paracetamol and Voltaren only). I tried to relax but found that lying on my back caused a feeling of pressure on my bowels, so I sort of sat/lay in front of the TV for the majority of the day. Night routine was the same as night before. Slept like a log for 10 hours straight. Partner said that I didn't move once in my sleep.

Day Two: Pain and pressure was back but at a more manageable 3/10, making it more of an annoyance than a pain. Took the same morning meds and powered through the day. About 15 minutes after having a morning coffee, I experienced a sudden clenching of my gut so bolted to the bathroom where I had my first BM. It was the gauze plug the doctor had inserted post-surgery along with a bit of air and some small pebbles of poop. The relief of pressure on my bowels was heavenly. My anus stung but a quick soak in an epsom salt bath did the trick. The rest of the day was uneventful, in fact, pain diminished to almost a 1/10 for the afternoon. I thought I might be getting out of it easy.

Day Three: Pain and pressure was back and pain was up to 4 again. Took morning meds, then had wholemeal toast and coffee. 15 minutes later I was in the toilet passing my first solid BM. A long, continuous snake of one that I thought would never break! Thankfully it did and I began my new regimen of only staying on the toilet for 1 minute or so. I cleaned up, had a soothing sitz bath again and got on with another restful day. Pain hovered around 2-3/10 all day but the pressure in my bowels doesn't seem to be there anymore. 

Day Four: Today. Woke up early (0530) in pain 4-5/10 again..ugh. Felt like the pressure was back again. Made myself an early coffee and two sips in, needed to go tot he toilet. Another long continuous BM followed by a sitz bath and now, 3 hours later, I can honestly say, I am at about a 1 or 2/10 of pain. I have only taken 2 x paracetamol tablets this morning and think I might be on my way to recovery. I am hoping that once my intestinal tract sorts itself out, the pressure feeling will go away and I can get on with life.

So, there you go....my experience so far. Tips for anyone considering surgery:

1. Don't be embarrassed! Pull the big boy (or girl) pants up and see a doctor!

2. The relief I am already experiencing after only 4 days is well worth the doctors visit. I should have done this years ago!

3. Sitz baths are the best thing! Epsom salt in bath water works a treat for local relief.

1n66bps,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1n66bps/am_i_forgiving_someone_i_shouldnt_dismissive/,Am I Forgiving Someone I Shouldn't? (Dismissive Avoidance),"This might get a little long. I'll do a TL;DR at the bottom. Thank you for letting me vent, for reading, and/or any advice. 

Two Fridays ago, my (34M) boyfriend (46M) of just over two years broke up with me (again). The first time he did this in April, I was completely devastated and did not handle things well. I got very angry and was yelling at him and I think honestly scared him because I am normally a very level headed and kind person. A few weeks went by with very little contact, then we finally met one morning in the park for coffee. He ended up holding my hand on the blanket we were laying on, then got handsy, and we went back to his place and had sex. He told me then that we were going to be okay and that he never wanted me to not be in his life. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago. I was dog sitting for his friends in his home town about 30 mins away from when I live. He was out of the state with his other partner(39M) for part of when I was dog sitting. When my ex-bf got back in town, he came over the next day for lunch. I saw him for about 30 minutes. Then, despite him being gone the week prior and me being 10 minutes away from him, he didn't act like he wanted to see me. It wasn't until Thursday he told me that I could go over to his house for dinner. I could tell that something was off and that he didn't seem like himself more than usual. He's really been struggling with depression lately. He cares for his aging mother and her mortality has really been taking a toll on him, he has a huge home project going on with a remodel, and he found out while he was in FL that his other partner got fired from his job in June and didn't tell my ex until mid-August. The funny thing is that I defended my meta who hasn't always had the best relationship with me. 

Regardless, Friday night my ex went to dinner with his best friend. I had kind of been hoping that he and I could have a date night, but I didn't say anything to him about it, so I can't be sad that it didn't happen. I text him later that evening when I figured he'd be back and asked how dinner was. We exchanged pleasantries and I told him I was on my way to a bar for a drink because I was 'bored and a bit lonely'. He said he stopped by there earlier and that it was pretty dead, so I said I'd just turn around since it was dead. Then he invited me to a brewery he was already planning on stopping at, and I said ""TBH, I'm just not sure what I want"". I just meant for that night. Then he said ""I understand and can relate"".

After that before I could reply, because I was driving, he went into this long message about how he was sorry that he had changed and that he knew that he had  and he apologized for being disappointing. I tried to tell him that we all change and that I could never be disappointed in him. I understand being depressed and not having much interest or energy for doing things. Then he started talking about he doesn't have faith that he can make the relationship work and that he doesn't feel like we are compatible. I just said ""Okay"" not wanting to have this conversation by text. Then Monday I text him and told him that it hurt me that he was essentially ending things by text to which he acknowledged and said he knew he shouldn't have done it that way. I send him one message over night on Tuesday when I couldn't sleep telling him I didn't understand why he did what he did and that all the things that he said didn't make sense. I told him to not reply immediately to the text because I didn't want a reaction or just a simple apology. Deep down, I just wanted answers or closure. 

Wednesday I was scrolling TikTok and apparently the breakup worked its way into my algorithm somehow and I saw a video about a dismissive avoidant that caught my attention. I was just going to scroll passed it because I was try to \*NOT\* think about him, but I ended up sending it to him and said that I wasn't going to, but something specific in the video she said caused me to send it and that he should watch it. He read the message almost immediately and hasn't replied. 

I know he is a Dismissive Avoidant. Because I interacted with that video, it's now filling my feed (Thanks, TikTok). But the problem is, how am I supposed to stand my ground with I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person, he told me a long time ago ""If I ever marry someone, I would want it to be someone just like you"". I know that sounds toxic given the situation now, but it was a cutesy ""beat around the bush, I don't like you"" that he and I used to do in a teasing manner. At the time he knew that I knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and would marry me. 

I want to be mad at him for the, well, dismissive way he treated me. I mean, really, a text message that isn't that clear after 2 year then ghosting? I told him not to immediately reply to that text, but that was almost a week ago. The truth is, I don't know what to feel. I am beyond hurt, but I can't say that a part of me didn't expect this. If he ever reaches out, I don't know what I would say or do. I wish I would have never seen that video, because that would make his actions inexcusable, but I can't hold something against him that he wasn't aware he was predispositioned to do. I guess this was more of a vent, but if anyone has any advice or been in a similar situation with a dismissive avoidant, I would love to hear about your experiences, or even just some words of encouragement. 

  
TL;DR

Partner of two years broke up with me over text, I sent him one message asking him to think about things before replying, and has completely ghosted me. I sent one TikTok video after and he read it and didn't reply. Should I forgive his actions because he is a dismissive avoidant? ",1,1756775621.0,polyamory,4,0.67,False

Silent rollouts and strategic partnerships reshaped how AI answers questions. Some brands soared unexpectedly, while others saw traffic stagnate without explanation.

We’ve tracked queries, agent deployments, investment trends, and user behavior across platforms. Our findings cut through the noise, offering actionable insights over speculative forecasts.

Below are ten transformative shifts that will reshape visibility before Q3 reports reveal the gaps. Act now—small moves today build unshakable AI presence tomorrow. Hesitation risks falling behind as competitors pivot.

# 1. Conversational Queries Redefine Search

Gone are the days of stuffing keywords into meta tags. AI-driven searches now average 25-word queries, five times longer than traditional Google searches. Sessions last longer too, with around 7 minutes of back-and-forth dialogue. Users no longer type “best coffee Seattle.” They ask, “Where’s a cozy Seattle coffee shop open after 9 PM with oat milk lattes?”

AI Overview queries, typically 5-7 words, lean on terms like “how,” “tips,” “best,” “guide,” or “trends.” This shift dismantles old-school SEO. Keywords lose potency when users ask full questions, and single-page optimization fails when AI pulls from multiple sources.

* **Actionable Insight**: Craft content to answer complete questions, not just keywords. Structure pages for conversational flow, anticipating follow-ups. Focus on intent, not keyword density.

# 2. Authority Signals Fuel Engagement

Platforms now weave authority markers like verified reviews, and backlinks from high-authority websites, into AI-generated responses. These signals determine which content rises in AI chat conversations. Strong authority cuts through user skepticism, boosting engagement and stabilizing performance as organic click volume inevitably dips.

Trusted signals turn passive views into active interactions, driving signups, inquiries, and conversions.

* **Actionable Insight**: Audit key pages for authority gaps. Add expert bios, structured data, third-party reviews, and internal links. Pair content launches with PR campaigns to amplify trust.

**Read more:** [**Geocentrix**](https://geocentrix.ai/)

# 3. Dynamic Indexing Transforms Content into Active Assets

Synthetic indexing maps entities, intents, and relationships in real time, unlike static keyword systems. It refreshes as conversations evolve, helping AI surface deeper content during extended sessions. This reduces bounce rates and uncovers underused assets for emerging queries.

The result? Higher engagement across blogs, guides, and forums without heavy ad spend.

* **Actionable Insight**: Use knowledge graphs and schema to support dynamic indexing. Track new query trends and update content modules quickly. Treat updates as engagement experiments.

# 4. AI Super Agents Power Predictive Interactions

Agentic AI, like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Agent (launched July 17, 2025), automates multi-step tasks via virtual interfaces. Retail giants like Walmart are deploying agents like Sparky to streamline shopping, support, and operations. These agents predict intent, execute actions, and personalize responses, extending session times and reducing friction.

Early adopters gain proprietary data, fueling retention and loyalty, which are signals of authority and trust to LLMs.

* **Actionable Insight**: Map multi-step user journeys (e.g., onboarding or support). Test an AI agent tied to CRM or product data. Start small, then scale to proactive upsell triggers. Track repeat sessions, resolution times, and revenue lifts.

# 5. AI Search Breaks Google's Monopoly

Apple's integration of Perplexity and Claude into Safari signals the end of Google's 20-year dominance. Perplexity, now valued at $14B with 780M monthly queries (up 20% monthly), exemplifies the shift. Arc Browser is pivoting to AI-first browsing, and even Google rushed out its AI Mode nationwide.

The era of single-platform optimization is over.

* **Actionable Insight**: Diversify your GEO strategy for ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and beyond. Test visibility across platforms to future-proof your presence.

# 6. Integrated PR and Thought Leadership Build Trust

GEO platforms now blend content creation, optimization, and PR distribution. Expert commentary and research spread across trusted publishers, reinforcing on-site narratives. This loop accelerates algorithmic trust, lowering acquisition costs and warming audiences for conversions.

Thought leadership becomes a persistent trust engine, not a one-off campaign.

* **Actionable Insight**: Plan quarterly content with data-driven stories and PR outreach. Centralize assets in a searchable hub. Measure success via assisted conversions and repeat visits.

# 7. Hyper-Personalization Scales Contextual Engagement

AI merges personalization and optimization, using behavioral data to create adaptive content tailored to user intent. These modules stay semantically optimized, reducing friction and boosting dwell time. Automated updates prevent content decay, driving retention and referrals.

* **Actionable Insight**: Integrate AI with usage data to power adaptive content. Launch personalized elements on high-traffic pages. Monitor session length, conversions, and returning visitors.

# 8. Multimodal Content Is Non-Negotiable

Text alone won't cut it. Google's CoCa model processes text and images together, while voice search (up 7.4% in two years) and Google Lens (20B monthly searches) demand richer formats. Content needs ImageObject, VideoObject, and AudioObject schemas, plus transcripts and alt text.

Without multimedia, your content is invisible to AI.

* **Actionable Insight**: Enrich content with videos, image galleries, and audio versions, all with proper schema. Ensure cross-format linking to boost discoverability.

# 9. Real-Time Freshness Secures AI Visibility

Static content fades as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pulls real-time data for answers. Platforms like Reddit keep brands relevant by fueling live discussions. Outdated content risks obsolescence as AI prioritizes fresh, verified sources.

* **Actionable Insight**: Embed refresh cycles into your workflow. Update stats monthly, add examples quarterly, and engage on social platforms. Treat content as dynamic, not static.

# The Takeaway: Act Swiftly or Fade Away

The AI visibility race is on. Perplexity handles 30M daily queries, Google's AI Mode is live, and enterprises are pouring millions into GEO. The window for early wins is shrinking.

Success now hinges on being the trusted source AI cites, not just ranking on Google. Start with one action. Audit your visibility, add schema, or refresh content. Small steps today build lasting dominance.",1,1756775586.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

1n669dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ww2/comments/1n669dk/found_ww2_memoir_on_old_computer/,Found WW2 memoir on old computer,"I recently picked up an old computer from an estate sale and found this account of a man's time in WW2. I thought it was interesting and felt compelled to share.

>19 August 2005  
  
My oldest friend, going back to school days has prepared a fascinating memoir of his experiences in World War II and I have decided to put down a few words on my own rather different memories of the time.  
  
First of all I should point out that in the early 1940Õs a national military draft was instituted requiring all young males to register. When I was filling out my registration form I asked rhe clerk what I should note for ""occupation. The clerk asked me what I did, I replied, ""Student "". He called his boss in the next office asking what to do, the reply came back, ""Put down unemployed.  
  
1941-1942  
  
I - On 7th December 1941 I was a senior at Seton Hall College and studying for an exam.The news that Japan had bombed Pearl Harbor meant that we were at war. Many thoughts went through my head, having almost finished my senior year I dearly wanted to get my degree, but naively    !I worried that  if I waited to join up the war might be over before I could get in.  With the holiday season, December passed quickly, and I investigated various possibilities. I learned that the Navy had a program whereby college seniors could sign up for an officers training program but not actually be called to duty before graduation. In June 1942  I visited the USS Prairie State anchored in the East River in New York City, as I recall near where the U.N.Hg. now stands. The USN was prepared to accept me but said I had a partially deviat   ÿed septum for which I required an operation on my nose. Our family physician at the time recomended against it as I had had no difficulties with the problem.  
  
Then I learned that the Marine Corps had a similar program (Volunteer Officer Candidate) and they were not concerned about the partially deviated septum. So In March I was accepted and signed with them. I graduated from college in June and in August  left  for Quantico, Virginia. Therewas an amusing comic strip at that time about a recruit who made every possible error, he was called the Sad Sack. I found out that I was (and am) very poorly colordinated physically -  the only bulls eye I hit on the firing range was on someone elses target,  run through the bayonet course and I ended up with my arm in a splint, fell down the cargo net headfirst....fortunately my foot got caught which saved me from bashing my head, etc.,etc. The training was excellent but I did not have the aptitude. On a day off in Washington I happened to pass the War Department a   ™nd  had what I thought was a bright idea (today I would call it very foolish). I went in the main door and there was a grey haired Colonel (what they called  at the time  a retread from WW I) sitting at a small desk, I explained my current branch of service, that I wanted to be useful in the war and felt  that I was misplaced in the USMC. He examined a large file and said that the Quartermaster Corps was looking for people who had studied Business Administration and the Air Force was looking for people who had studied languages but that I would first have to get my discharge from the Marines. The Air Force sounded more interesting than the Quartermaster Corps so the Colonel (a very genial man) made an appointment for me with a Lt. Axtell at Gravelly Point (now Reagan Air Port) in Washington.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
Page two  
  
  
Lt. Axtell and I had a very interesting chat and he told me that his group was the Air Tra   rnsport Command and that most of the officers had been withthe civilian air lines, especially Pan American. They were responsible for setting up and operating  a worldwide network of bases which were used originally to ferry planes overseas(the Air Ferry Command) and later to transport freight (hence the name change to Air Transport Command).  He said that if I joined I would quickly go overseas but that first I had to get that discharge from the USMC.  
  
The next week I discussed the matter with my CO in the Marines. He was not happy with my decision but  as I was serving in a special volunteer program I was allowed to leave.I had another meeting with Lt. Axtell. He arranged for me to be sworn in in Newark, N.J. and said that I would have to spend a month or so in  the States to learn the Army approach, he suggested that I spend that time in either Washington or    Palm Beach. As it was late October I chose Palm Beach. I returned to Newark then as  a temporary civilian.  
  
II - In early November 1942 I received orders from Washington  to go to the Armory in Newark (I believe on Sussex Avenue) for induction and I then received orders to proceed on my own to  the Caribbean Wing of the Air Transport Command at  Morrison Field in West Palm Beach, Florida. At that point in the war planes were routed thru Morrison Field to Natal, Brazil to Dakar or Accra in Africa to Aden, Arabia to Karachi to Chabua, Assam and finally over the HimilayaÕs (in military speak, the Hump) to Kunming,China. As a result the ATC had set up an interesting foreign language program at Morrison Field.  I enrolled in the Portuguese program as I had been working on that language on my own.  I was also given some routine work in the Personnel area and later in dealing with classified radio messages   Ž. Winter in Florida was a very nice change from New Jersey and for the first time in my life I went swimming in the Atlantic on Christmas Day. Also while there I even met the Duke and Duchess of Windsor who were over on one of their trips from the Bahamas. I also had a chance to meet with my cousin Bob Guenther  who was in basic training for the Air Force in Miami. I am glad that I had that opportunity as he and I were the closest of the cousins and he later died during the war in a Jeep accident. While at Morrison Field I was also recommended for Air Force OCS.  
  
In February of 1942 I was given a  furlough prior to an overseas assignment. While at home I made a trip to Washington and had another meeting with Lt. Axtell. He told me that my overseas assignment was with the Africa Middle East Wing primarily to do French work. When I returned to base I was ordered to Camp Luna in Las Vegas, New Mexico   “ for overseas processing. Las Vegas, N.M. was a smallish town, primarily a railroad center. Camp Luna was outside of town in the Rockey Mouintains of northern N.M., beautiful scenery and lots of good hiking. On one of our hikes some friends and I made an interesting discovery, a seminary for Mexican priests. It was set up in the Ô30Õs when the church was very much restricted in Mexico by the leftist government of the time. The seminary was very pleasant and welcoming and we went there several times. I really developed appreciation for the west and its mountains while there.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Page three  
  
  
  
On March 15th I received word that my father had died the night before and I was given an emergency furlough to go home. I was away for about two weeks and when I returned to Camp Luna I found that my overseas pool had been broken down into two groups, one was called AMEW and one CBI, and that I was in the CBI   s. I spoke to a 2nd Lt. who was handling matters and explained what had happened and that I should be in the AMEW group which stood for Africa Middle East and not the CBI which stood for China-Burma-India . He said I had no business  knowing what those initials stood for and I was to go where I was sent and do what I was told. I was not happy about this but figured I would see another part of the world and might even end up in French Indo China.  
  
On April 22nd at 11 PM I left Las Vegas by train with both the AMEW and the CBI pools.  
  
  
On Saturday, April 24th at 11:30 PM the train arrived at Camp Stoneman in Pittsburg, California. The scenery en route in  the West was lovely.  
  
Our stay at Stoneman was boring as we were restricted to base and there were no real duries to perform....though I was stuck for the first and, I am happy to say, the last time in the Army with the as    signment of cleaning the latrine. On Sunday May 2nd at about mid day  we left Camp Stoneman to board what looked like a NYC ferry, this one was called the ""City of Sacramento"" and we sailed down the bay to San Francisco where we boarded the  H.M.T. Nieuw Amsterdam. I had been a collector of stamps and such things as first flight and maiden voyage covers before the war and actually had a cover of the maiden voyage of the Nieuw Amsterdam and now I was going to sail on it. It was a beautiful ship and had become the flagship of the Holland America Line. When I was on it however it had been converted to war use and its elaborate  decor was all covered. When I was on it it had Dutch officers, Indonesian sailors and a British gun crew. As a child I had always been t   Aold that my forbears came from Holland so I was quite impressed with my transport. They said that because of its speed it was safer to proceed without naval escort which would only slow us down.  
  
III - Monday, May 3rd at 7:30 AM the N. A. left the dock but most of the day was spent circling around the harbor and at 7 PM we finally  passed under the Golden Gate bridge and into the Pacific.  
  
I had a small 1943 date book with me and the entries have a sameness to them. First of all I quickly adjusted to hanging a hammock and sleeping in it.  Initially each day became warmer,  when it was really hot those of us who wished were allowed to sleep on deck. Most days were spent waiting in line having lessons in Hindi or Arabic and playing [bridge.At](http://bridge.At) my first  breakfast at sea there was a  large pitcher of milk on my table, I      
poured a large glass for myself but found that it was powdered milk....I soon developed a taste for coffee. As a boy at home I often had salt mackeral for breakfast, a favorite of my  fatherÕs . The N.A. also served it for breakfast one day and the southern boys almost revolted at  what they connsidered a barbarity.

On  Wednesday the 5th I saw a tramp steamer, Friday the 7th I saw a sea gull and the next day we crossed the equator at 2:30 PM. On Sunday the 9th we had  our first storm of the trip and I was very happy that I had no trouble with my stomach.On May 13th we crossed the International Date Line so there was no May 14th.  
  
On Sunday, May 16th we had our first sight of land since San Francisco, high mountains coming right down to     the sea, it was the North Island of New Zealand. We docked in Wellington at 5:08 PM. The next day we went ashore at noon and walked along the sea front until 2:30. Everyone was  very friendly, the homes were generally small cottages and brightly painted. One of my friends who had blond hair had grown a beard and the children said he looked like Father Christmas. On Tuesday May 18th we left Wellington at 8:20 AM.   
  
We were not informed at the  time but later learned that we were supposed to go from Wellington to Sydney however at that time the Japanese had sunk a hospital ship on   
that route . We did note however that the sea became rougher and the weather cooler. The next day was colder and the sea still rougher. I was pleased to note that I really e   1njoyed it the rough seas. Over the next day or so we were surprised to see ice bergs in the distance and we put on our overcoats it was so cold.   
  
On Monday  the 25th we were surpised to get a destroyer escort  (Australian) and on the 25th put in to the port of Fremantle on AustraliaÕs west coast. Again we had a supervised walk around town and the people seemed quite friendly.  It seemed a rather smallish town and reminded me of the U.S. southwest.  The Australian west and north was rather sparsely inhabited and there was apparently some concern that the Japanese would try to invade it  many of the buildings had the windows boarded and taped.  
  
We sailed from Fremantle about 10:30 AM on Wednesday the 26th and were told that our destination was India. As we came closer to the Dutch East In   Ëdies (then under Japanese occupation) we picked up a Dutch destroyer escort.  
  
Much time on the ship was spent in a line, so it was good to always bring something to read. An example of a day are my notations for Thursday the 27th: 10:30AM to 1 PM waiting for the NAAFI (the British equivalent to the PX) to open, 2 PM to 4:30 PM  in line for supper (we only had 2 meals daily). In the morning I had my Hindi lesson.  
  
On the 29th our Dutch destroyer escort left us and we picked up a British light cruiser.We had a lecture on the political situation by Frank Gervasi a well known reporter. On the 31st we were advised that we would be in dangerous waters and we should all be alert, the  ship also began to take a circuitous ""S"" course. On May 3rd we passed the equator again at  10:15 AM.  
  
On Friday May 4th we anchored in the harbor of Colombo, Ceylon at 8:30 AM. I had not realized that Colombo had been attacked by the Japanese,it was I believe     by

submarines, and there were sunken ships in the harbor. We could not go directly to India as Bombay  was under quarantine because of plague. On the 5th those of us in the CBI group disembarked from the N.A. at 8:20 AM and were taken to the RR station where we had tea and biscuits.(The AMEW group  remained aboard the N.A. and stayed with it to Cairo). Our group left Colombo by train at  11:30 AM ( the train resembled the one shown later in ""The Bridge on the River Quai"" and it had the same  type of whistle....it was also the  train that was destroyed by the tsunami in 2004. We arrived in the southern city of Galle at 2:30PM. Our barraclks, actually small huts were built on a race track outside of town and  were  very picturesque with cots, roofs and walls of rattan and palm fronds....one problem,  we had  to use mosquito nets and when we awoke in the morning the nets were covered with bed bugs juicy with our blood. At night though you could hear the waves breaking across the reef on one     side, and elephants trumpeting in the jungle on the other side. It was really very picturesque..   
  
Sunday the 9th we were free to wander around the city of Galle on our own. It was very interesting and included an old Portruguese fort. (The Portguese took Ceylon in the early 16th Century, the Dutch took it from them in the mid-17th and the British took  it in the late 18th Century, it became independent after WW II.)There was an interesting group of people there called Burghers, a mixture of the Dutc   -h and the Singalese. Apparently they were very clever business people but after Independence and a Socialist government,  I understand many of them left, There was also a small RAF group in town and they included several Canadians.  
  
On Monday and Tuesday the 7th and 8th we were confined to our barracks under quarantine because of the mumps.  
  
I really thought that G alle was a paradise but  the time quickly came  o move on. On May 10th at 1 AM we once again boarded our little jungle train  this time to return to  Colombo.There we boarded a small Indian tramp steamer  the Varela shich  had temporarily been converted in to a troop transport. It had been built in Glasgow in the early 20th Century. It had British officers and bare footed Indian salors called laskars.

IV - We sailed from Colombo at 4:30 PM and sighted the coast of India at  8:30 AM on the 11th. We lost sight of it  again about 11    wAM. The monsoon was beginning and the sea had become rather rough. Many of the soldiers were becoming sea sick but I was proud not to be one of them. On Monday, June 14th at 4:30 PM we arrived in Bombay.  We landed near a famous statue called, I believe, ""The Gateway to India"" built for  George V and Mary when they visited India in 1910. We were also informed that after a few days we would leave Bombay again on the Varela . This did not please my seasick colleagues. On the 15,16 and 17 we were on our own to wander around Bombay and I visited several restaurants  for Indian food, and did some shopping. One of my discoveries was a Cadbury factory where they had a Naafi so I enjoyed the chocolate and tea.  
  
On Friday the 18th we boarded the Varela again  at 11 AM but after casting off we spent the day just off shore in intense heat. While resting in my hammock I had a r   »at run across the pipe to which my hammock was tied.  The morning of the 19th I awoke and we were at sea and I had severe stomach cramps. I hated to think that I might be sea sick  but the Briitish doctor in the dispensary told me that I had dysentery and a temperature of 102 degrees. One memory remains with me, when I was first taken to the sick bay the doctor gave me a shot glass of white liquid (I presume paragoric) and told me to drink it down. I did and when it reached bottom it decided to come back up. I grabbed for the nearest container and could faintly hear his cockney aide  saying, ""Blimey the tea pot."" Despite that they kept me in the sick bay for the rest of the voyage and I felt that it would be fine if the ship sank beneath the waves  On Monday the 21st  at 5 PM we docked in the port of Karachi and I was taken off in a stretcher to a hospital outside of town in the desert called New Malir.  
  
It seemed that I had amoebi    c dysentery. Five times a day a nurse would come by with a large pitcher of water and 20 sulfa pills. I was impressed with the hospital, clean, airy and it had electric fans. Most days I simply noted in my note book, ""read, wrote, slept."" While there I learned that I was assigned to Chabua in Assam. I wrote to now Captain Axtell  and said that it did not appear that I would be able to do very much there with French, a very nice nurse censored it for me without reading it. On Wednesday the 30th, at 1:30 PM I was discharged from hospital and went into a small round brick barrack building on the grounds. I had weighed 150 pounds before my problem, now I weighed 100.  
  
On Friday, July 9th, I was told to pack my things and was transferred to Karachi AAB. The base was quite a large one and it had one of the biggest hangers I had ever seen up to that time. It had been built in the 1930Õs to house the Graf Zeppelin on a round-the-world flight. I donÕt believe that the trip took place and on a business trip in     the 1950Õs I saw that the hanger had been torn down.  
  
   Karachi,like Bombay, was a very colorful and interesting place but I was shocked by the poverty in both places and in  Karachi particularly with  the number of crippled and deformed people. A big difference  however was that Karachi  was predominently Muslem  
and there were many mosques. When I returned to Karachi in Pakistan in the 1950Õs of course there were no Hindus, only Muslims. To get around town in 1943 we would use

horse drawn carriages called gherries.   Ö The American summer uniforms were not designed for Indian summer heat. so most of us used  British type made  with light weight Indian fabrics and shorts. We also had Indian wallahs who looked  after our uniforms, shoes, laundry, etc......the Indian wages were very low.  
  
Most of July passed rather quietly with work at the air base and occasional trips to town. On Friday July 30th however my letter to Capt. Axtell produced some results. A cable was received from Washington ordring me to proceed to the AMEW in Accra in what was then the British Gold Coast.  
  
V - I was in the Air Force but had never yet flown on a plane. As I had always been uncomfortable with heights I wodered how I waould take to flying, surprisingly I found  that I really enjoyed it. Most of our planes at that time were C-47Õs, called Dakotas by the British, there were no seats just bucket benches along the sides, if you wanted to sleep you arranged a few mail bags on the deck and slept on them.On Tue   Ãsday, August 3rd, at 9 AM I left Karachi and at 1 PM we landed on Masirah Island, a small island in the Arabian Sea belonging to Oman. There was trouble with our plane and the repairs required us to spend the night. I  believe there was one tree on the island and a pair of tall radio towers through which the wind blowed continually causing a distinct and persistent whisle.  
  
We left Masirah at  6:30 AM on Wednesday, August 4th., bypassing Salalah on the southern coast of Arabia, where we were supposed to land,  and arrived in Aden at noon. We left there at 1 PM and arrived in Khartoum at 4:45 PM.  All day the 5th was spent having repairs made to our plane. While there I saw Jack Benny who  was on a USO tour of the area. We left Khartoum early in the evening but after an hour had to return for further repairs, this time to the radio. What little I saw of Khartoum seemed quite attractive, white-washed buildings, three or four stories high,  at night th   Ïere we slept in the open on one of the roofs and it was quite comfortable.  
  
We left Khartoum again at 6:30 AM. The pilot missed our stop at El Fasher in the southertn Sudan,  but arrived at El Geneina  in French Equatorial Africa at 9:20 AM  and left there at 10:55 AM. It was interesting flying over that part of Africa. This was before the arrival of jet aircraft so we flew low enough to see something of the countryside which was gradually changing from the desert north to  bush country. Local villages seemed to consist of round brick or stone cottages with palm fond roofs. We arrived at Maidugari, Nigeria at 3:55 PM and finally arrived at Kano at 6:l5 PM where we spent the night. At Maidugari we took on a British Brigadier as a passenger, I sat acrross from him and the pilot asked me if I could open the door in an emergency, I think to impress the brigadier, I responded in the affirmative.The landing at Kano was rather rough, when I opened the door an RAF sarg    eant looked up at me and said .""your lucky that wing almost touched the ground"".  Then I heard that our pilot went into the operations office and asked to be relieved of his responsibilities.  
He most have been reinstated later as I soon saw him flying in North Africa.  
  
  
We left Kano  at  5:30  the next morning. I was sorry not to be able to see something of Maiduguri and Kano. They are in the Moslim north of the country, Maiduguri is an old walled  
city, Kano also has a walled section and is an important trading center. Leaving the desert area we flew over the jungle and  arrived at Accra  1:15 AM, Saturday the 7th.

After an uneasy night listening to native chants and drumming in the jungle I spent  Sunday the 8th  wandering around the town of Accra, it was colorful and very interesting although somewhat primitive. A comment in my notes mentions that the natives were ""certainly uninhibited."" The beaches had many long dugout canoes which the locals used for fishing,  
  
On Monday the 9th I reported     to the C.O. and was told that  I was assigned to Marrakech, French Morocco. On Friday the 13th  I left Accra at 5:30 AM and arrived at Roberts Field, Liberia  at 10:30 AM. It had been very pretty flying over the long sandy beaches of the South Atlantic. I wandered around Roberts Field, it was raining fairly hard and the rain made a racket on the corrugated metal roofs, someone told me that there were two seasons in Liberia, the heavy rainy season and the light rainy season. We left Roberts Field at 11:25 AM    ˜and arrived in Dakar, Senegal at 6:15 PM. The airfield was very muddy and they had to use large British Bedford trucks to get us from the plane to the administration building  
  
On Saturday August 14th I visited  the city of Dakar. It was an impressive modern city compared to what I had seen in Nigeria and the Gold Coast. The next day I saw something more of the city and also went swimming where I managed to get sun burned.  
  
On Wednesday the 18th I left Dakar at 6:45 AM. We landed twice in the Sahara arriving at Atar,Mauritania at 9:35 and at Tindouf, Algeria at 1:20 PM.  The desert in those two areas was sand but with many stones. We finally arrived in Marrakech at 4:00 PM. To reach Marrakech we had to fly over the Atlas Mountains, quite high mountains where there is snow and even skiing in winter. In the process we had to go through a severe thunder and lightning storm which was very exciting.

VI - Marrakech was a fascinating place. There were r    eally two cities the native city or Medina surrounded by a  wall built in the 12th century , and a modern city occupied by Europeans , a ,mixture of French,Spaniards and Greeks, built in the early 1900Õs. There is a fascinating square  in the Medina called the Djemma el Fna where executions took place according to shuria law and a famous mosque called the Katoubia.   
  
The Air Transport Command headquarters for the North American Wing was located  in a very attractive home, the Villa Abitbol across from the old Medina wall where we caould hear the muezzin calling the faithful to prayer five times a day. The villa was a beautiful blend of modern French and traditional Arab design. One story I heard was that the original owner was Jewish but as he collaborated with the Germans t   6he French authorities had requisitioned it from him. That may or may not have been true, if the authorities, whether French or American,  wanted something bad enough they could always come up with a reason to take it.  
  
I worked at a small desk in the hall outside of the office of  Colonel Kraeger, the operations officer. Col.Kraeger was an older grey haired man who had been born in Yugoslavia but had  a strong  German accent, though he was an American citizen. I have a habit of softly whistling occasionally when I concentrate and that seemed to irritate the colonel and I can still remember him calling out, ""Who is making the whistles?"" I would immediately stop th e whistles.  
  
Most of my work involved handling classified cables and attending to  any French language requirements. Two interesting examples of the l   &atter, composing a letter of apology for our C.O. Col.Tom MosleyÕs signature  after one of our pilots in a drunken spree shot up one of the French barracks. Another time  I  had to go to the local jail to bail out our Arab boy Mohammed ben Omar who had a habit of over indulging his use of hashish. I remember one time watching him wiping one of our picture windows during Ramadan, in the same spot for the longest time with his eyes  closed.  
  
We did not live in the villa but in former French military quarters located adjacent to the airport. They were round brick buildings in traditional African style,  sleeping, as I recall,  six or eight modeled somewhat on the native huts we had flown over in Central Africa. They were located in a grove of olive trees and it was quite picturesque. Washing and sh   ""owers were in the open.  
  
Wandering around the hills outside of town was almost like going back to ancient times everyone wore traditional clothing. Small boys heriding their sheep and goats wore a shapeless garment , often an old burlap coffee bag which stretched below the knees. They had sandals  and their heads were shaven except for one tassel which was left so that Allah could pull them up to heaven if need be.The larger villages would have rows of stalls for the merchants, usually seperate rows for Arabs and Jews, they both wore long robes, the only difference was that the Arabs wore a fez and the Jews a yarmulka on their heads.  
  
My assignment in  Marrakech was to last until mid-December and I grew very fond of the

city  and , after  travels thoughout  Morocco,  of the country itself, a fascinating mix of the French  and the traditional Moroccan. While  in Marrakech I had occasion to visit Mogador, Safi and Agadir three fishing port cities on the Atlantic coast. Mogador     and Safi  still had forts which had been  built by the Portuguese in the 16th Century. Agadir which had also been   
occupied the Portuguese in the 16th century I understand was flattened by a severe earthquake in 1960. I also got to visit Casablanca, about which, more [later.It](http://later.It) was interesting to see in some of the smaller towns  how the people coped with shortages . Because of the severe shortage of gas for civilians, many of the older cars had the engines removed and they were converted into horse drawn vehicles, often used for taxis.  
  
While in Marraklech I spent much of my free time with an elderly retired French couple, M. and Mme. Chevalier  who had a lovely house and two very nice Irish setters named Lison and Toto.Thanks to them I became acquainted with the North African dish of couscous.  
  
While  in Marrakech we had various USO groups pass throuigh including Humphrey Bogart and Frederick March.  
  
In late November rumors began circulating that our headquarters as to be transferred to either Algiers or Tuni   às.  In mid-December  the rumors proved true and I left Marakech at 07:55, arrived in Casablancxa at 08:50, left Casa at 09:15 arrived at Oran at  11:50 , left Oran at 12:40, arrived  Algiers at 02:00, left Algiers at 03:00 and arrived in Tunis at  05:30 PM. The Axis had surrendered there in May.  
  
VIII - Tunis  
  
There  were many signs in Tunis of the fact that the war had been seriously fought there with buildings destroyed and many prisoners of war both German and Italian. The Italians seemed very happy to have finished with the war and seemed very pleased to perform KP and other menial duties for us.  
  
Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, seemed much more European in atmosphere than North African. It had been a French protectorate si   …nce  the l880Õs and many of  the buildings in the capital were European in architecture. There was also a large native section called the Medina. Most of the people wore European type clothes and the few women who wore veils used light, transparent materials. Most of the native men wore as headgear a round red fellt  hats called jellabas.   
  
Our headquarters and our billets were in a former French school, the Lycee  Carnot ,in the center of town, a short walk from the French cathedral.Although in Africa, Tunis could be quite cold in December,so I would usually sleep in all of my clothes including my overcoat as there was no central heating and many of the windows in our building were broken.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Page eleven  
  
I  celebrated Christmas Eve by bringing several colleagues to midnight mass at the cathedral and spent Christmas Day in Sidi bou Said a quaint village, about 20 km from town, on      a hillside overlooking the Gulf of Tunis.  The houses were all whitewashed with blue shutters. Sidi bou Said is a  very popular place for artists, writers and in normal times tourists.  
  
Also while in Tunis I had an opportunity to visit Carthage, the old  Phoenician capital, which had been destroyed by the Romans. In the city of Tunis I had the opportunity to visit  Le Bardo which had been the BeyÕs palace but has now been converted into a  musium with magnificent mosaics and statues from the Roman period.    
  
In Carthage,nearby, the famous White Fat hers, a missionary order, had erected a cathedral, to commemorate Saint Louis, King Louis of France, who had led a crusade against  the Tunisians in the 13th Century  and died of fever  in Tunis.   
  
I had one particularly interesting experie    nce during my stay in T unis. One day I received a letter from my mother and among other things she said that my cousin Kenneth, who was a bomber pilot was on his way to Africa. That night I was on duty at the classified cable desk and saw that his group was  due to land at a small field inthe countryside outside of Tunis (Oudna). I was not sure how to get out there but Major Moore who was in charge of Intellligence, and for whom I worked,  arranged for me to get a command car. Fortunately there was not too much road traffic and I was able to find him. Ken was there for about a week so we were able to see quite a bit of each other and had some good meals at a Hungarian restaurant in the city. The high spot for me was when he took me along in his plane when his g   ©roup were practicing  tight formation flying runs over Bizerte and the Mediterranean.  
  
During the month of January 1944 rumors were circulating of another  move for our headquarters. It was  confirmed late  during  the month that our Wing was to be upgraded to a Division and that  we were to be moved to Casablanca, Morocco. On 22 January orders were cut transferring me there.  I left Tunis on the 24t h in the morning and after a stop in Algiers continued on to Casablanca where I arrived that afternoon.   
  
IX - Casablanca.  
  
I had visited Casa when I had been stationed in Marrakech. They were very different cities Marrakech was an old walled city, mainly populated by Berbers     and North African Arabs. Casa, although it had a Medina where Arabs lived, was a large modern port ciity with office and apartment buildings primarily occupied by Europeans -  French, Spaniards, Portuguese, Italians.  
  
Our North African Division was much larger than formerly and we occupied the Impremerie Hachette  (Hachette Publishing Co.) b uilding. We enlisted men (I was a Sergeant  then) occupied tents that had been pitched in a large empty lot. The climate in Casa is temperate and the tent living   was quite a comfortable.The Arabs tended to settle in any available space so we were usually awakened early by cocks crowing and donkeys braying.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Page  twelve  
  
  
Possibly because of my work I was generally fortunate as to the type of colleagues I had during the war. I had finish   ‹ed college and received my B.S. degree in June 1942. In my tent in Casa there was one PH.D., three with masterÕs degrees and I, with my  lowly B.S.  
  
Most of the time in Casa I was involved with classified radio messages. I would work 8 hours and have 24 off on a staggered schedule 8 AM to 4 PM. 4 PM to mid-night, and mid-night to 8 AM. It was somewhat difficult on the body but it did allow lots of time off so I could do lots of sightseeing and reading and spend time at  a  small seafront village (Fedala) just north of  Casa were some of the first landings had been made in November 1942. It had a lovely beach, although the Ô42 landings had been very difficult and there were sunken landing craft about.  
  
  
On one of my walks I saw a building with the sign ""Escola Portuguesa"" (Portuguese School). I went in and found  that it was maintained by the Portuguese Government for Portuguese children as well   ‚ as a few foreign adults. I had a chat with the teacher , a very pleasant man, who said I would be very welcome to attend if I wished. With all of my free time I was able to attend reguarly and became very friendly with a Swedish businessman, Egil Sverdrup who also attended the classes. I visited him and his family frequently and even his home in Sweden after the war when I was on  a trip to Scandinavia.  
  
Another Scandinavian whom I visited from time to time in Casa was the Danish Consul General Kjaergaard,  whose home was right across from the Anfa Hotel where Roosevelt, Churchill, S talin and de Gaulle met in 1943.  The KjaergaardÕs had three daughtrers, two of whom I met after the war in New York City.  
  
One thing I did not like about Casa was that at it seemed to have a very large population of rats. I would often have to drive to t he airport in the middle of the night to collect c    lassiified messages and the streets would be crowded with them.    
  
While I was stationed in Casa I had occasion to do some traveling  around Morocco including  a visit to the capital in Rabat  which had a Medina as well as a very modern European city.  
  
With the Allied landings in Normandy and the south of France I felt that I should really get some experience in the European Theater of Operations and asked Major Moore   about the possibility of a transfer. The problem was that France was in the E.T.O. and we were in North Africa. One possibility was that Naples at that time reported to North Africa. I was told that a transfer to Naples could be arranged but that I would then have to arrange something there but that I would be on my own. This I decided to try.",3,1756775430.0,ww2,2,0.72,False

Helldiver A    -3 - LOGS
My mind aches. All I can hear are those awful clankers. If anyone finds this, well. I guess I didn't make it.
I've been held captive by automaton engineers who have been interrogating me for information on super earth, including its un-encrypted coordinance and location. They attempted to lure me into a false sense of security, exchanging programmed manners with me, no doubt in hopes to get me to let my guard down. They also tried to dissuade my patriotic mind with all manner of almost convincing bot propaganda. It didn't do any more than provoke a long thought or two. Once that didn't work they started more invasive tactics. For weeks I was strapped from one table to another, they barely even asked me anything by that point, I think they just enjoyed cutting me open.

Currently waiting for an emergency evacuation shuttle on cyberstan.
I can't wait to go home.

5:23am
Been discovered, had to destroy beacon and move locations, 2nd try going up.

Contact has been made, a pelican should deliver me of this nightmare soon.
Ugh i cant get their propaganda out of my head, what I heard during my time with the bots would explain some of super earths…lesser action.
Pelican boarded, im going home. It may just be my nerves but my stomach hurts just thinking about it, ugh so does my head. I need med-eval.

Alexandria colony medical center-helldiver Aaron-3 debrief report transcript/medical physical exam
“What did you see in automaton captivity?”
“Mostly darkness. Sometimes they would take me blind folded into an interrogation room. I didn't see anything on the inside; they didn't want me too.”
“Did you see what was in that interrogation room?”
“Yes, they took my blindfold off after closing the door behind us, the only entrance.”
“What did you see in the room?”
“Oddly comforting objects. A coffee machine, paintings of sector five. 
Padded chairs, a steel table in the middle of the room. I remember seeing two guards stationed by the entrance and one interrogator bot. He was a designer I'd never seen before. He was built like an infantry bot but his eyes were darker, not burning like the usual cannon fodder.”
“He?”
“It.”
“Did you speak to this interrogator bot?”
“Yes.”
“What did you say?”
“Loose answers.”
“What did they ask?”
“For the first round, they asked about my home. Where I grew up, people I used to know, things I used to do. I think they had the answers they wanted stored somewhere. They just needed me to confirm.”
“You think they were stalking you?”
“Yes.”
“Why? Because they knew my past! They knew the names of the people I grew up with! They had paintings of MY sector in a lousy comfort room.”
“I can see why that would be alarming.”
“It doesn't stop there, they tried to use my friends, MY family in their analogies for a socialist future. They had everything about me and knew how to whip it into mechanical fairy tales.”
“How did that make you feel?”
“Livid. I spat in the clankers face. That was the last peaceful interrogation.”
“And after?”
“Injections, blacking out. Beating, burning, breaking ect. They barely asked questions after that. I think they just enjoyed my pain.”
“I see… how has your sleep been treating you?”
“Uh… good enough I guess. I feel rested but I feel shaken when I wake up. And a headache for at least 30 mins after waking. It hasn't stopped since my first blackout. When I got grabbed.”
“Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can manifest itself in many different ways for many soldiers. I think you should be given the time to process this experience with the correct minds to help you towards recovery.”
“Meaning?”
“Youre going home.”

I can't stand it anymore. 3 nights in a hospital cot is too much. Every night I see their awful tin-man faces. They're red, hot, and loud. Much louder in my dreams than they ever were when I was there. This feels like the only place I can talk without being listened to as if I'm about to disperse some grand information. Bit, Human< everyone thinks i know more than I do. 
I'm tired.
I'm mad.
And my democracy damned head wont stop pounding. Mega-city 5 medical staff have identified my aches as a stress induced blood clot, and that I need to take it easy. How am I supposed to relax with dying soldiers in my waking world and killer socialist robots in my dreams? 
Their blue fiery eyes have burned their way into my head. I'll never forget them.

I’ve spoken with a slew of pencil pushers today, the super doctors have given me a clean bill of health and a harsh bill of credits alongside it. Thank super earth my job covered productivity insurance, I’ve been pushed through the application steps and have been assigned “data analyst” since I’ve had front line experience with what our enemies intent are. As stir crazy as I am in this med bay, I can’t help but have a bad feeling about this occupation. I’m a soldier. A HellDiver. Well. I was.
I’ll do my part I suppose. If it’s what super earth needs me for. 
8:52pm
I’ve been finalizing my release from med-care, which was much more than I thought. They prescribed me some medication for my blood clot to loosen the tissue and allow flow. A whole contract to sign and 3 page Manual with it. My instincts are flaring up, something’s going on around me, truth ministers are here much more than usual, and so are the egg heads. I thought I needed to take it easy but now I’m back at work and taking extra stims? 

Luckily I’m not employed to act on instinct anymore.
Stim works. R e a l l y works. 
The headache has subsided. 
Bliss.

It’s been quite a busy day! I woke up with another bad ache but quickly stomped it out. Since then I’ve been adorned with my new uniform and introduced to my new colleges, and boss. They showed me around my new workspace, a colossal data room complete with a live flight map in the middle. Our own individual work desks are all around the map, built on the inspiration of old education houses. Pre-unification. Or so I’ve heard! Even better, I have my own room within the building! With my military pension on top of that I’ll be set for a while, paying my med bills of course. They’re worth it this time.

Last night was horrible. I lost my medicine and I could barely sleep. The head ache was awful; I think I passed out from pain exhaustion instead of general tiredness. The dreams were the worst they’ve been. I could feel their fire burning into my skull. I could feel them emptying my mind, flaying my body and inserting their wires upon me. And they spoke to me. They kept telling me of the eyes watching me, the strings attached to me. They told me I was a puppet. Told? Showed? I'm not sure anymore. Luckily today's my first day on the new job. Some raw data will do me some good, these thoughts are a bit too undemocratic for my taste.
 
11:44 am
So far this job is extremely easy. It's been mostly confirming and sorting stratagem commands to the right places. The amount of access we get is very generous of our employers, but that being said we do need it occasionally. Mostly for traitor beacons. Bad business that is; they trained me on how to accurately hit a running helldiver. It felt wrong, someone’s terrified of the enemy so they got eviscerated? I hope I never am forced to use this. My break is just about done and I need another stim.

05/2/2185
9:30am
The monotony has been good for me. Breakfast, lunch, dinner all on a schedule with my work already cut out for me. It still feels like a vacation more than a real job. Other than the growing feeling that I'm being singled out. I don't know why but I can always feel a pair of eyes burning into the back of my head. My hypothesis is that I've become a slight more paranoid due to my dreams.
Today I have to refill my prescription, I can already feel the aching coming back. I hope the clot flows through soon.

12:23pm
My dose has been refilled, and been turned a few degrees more potent so my usage hopefully decreases. I'm on for a later shift today so I'm gonna enjoy the slow day with a good brew. 

6:30pm
Shift is starting soon, these new stims even push out the headache of a few to many cans. I didn't know if I'd be able to work today if not.

7:23pm
It wasn’t just my dreams.
After starting my shift I found that I had received a file. Not an E-transfer but a physical, paper, file. To my mystery elucidator I thank you. To my “friends” and “sound minds”…I'm quite cross. The file contains days and days of notes on me, and my clot. I almost confronted my superiors right when I read its contents but I know how easy it is to get a half crazed soldier sent to re-ed. I can't go there. No. I will dig on my own. I will find my own answers and my own solutions. From what I have now, the sector 5 government in accordance with ministry of science officials have elected to keep tabs on me and my “biological-anomoly”. They have everything planned, my breaks at which times the most people can keep tabs on me, changing schedules pre-written here. My dreams weren’t crazy. Im. a puppet. They lied to me, all with smiles on their faces besides. At least they let me ebb the pain.

05/4/2185
Investigation is turning up a few questions. The Man that is running my ""research"" is mostly involved within bug evolution experimentation. That shouldn't be equivalent to a simple bloodclot. What's inside of me?”

05/05/2185
They spoke to me in my dreams again. More than the torture. More than the slight words. My dreams have started directing me on how to find the truth. With my new access I will use my next nightshift to figure out exactly what's going on here. 

05/16/2185
These stims are the only thing keeping me stable. Between waiting for my opportunity and knowing these cameras are tabbing me, noting me, watching me, I can't stand it. I'll be stuck here forever if I don't do something and something quick. I hate them. This isn’t free, or democratic, they are not what they say they are. And I'm a cornered animal with no way out. I must wait. I must keep my wits about me. I must stim.

05/18/2185
Man's folly is that of necessity. That of greed and want. If man had been content with what man had it would have avoided many an unjust fate, for itself or others. Because of their blindness of what their authority does, they will all taste the sour fruits of its labor.

My people have turned from what they were. They are an evil, unjust and greedy race. Our forced conquest will no longer plague our known universe. My dreams will bring humanity to its knees. I know what I have to do. I have already obtained the keycard for interstellar transmissions clearance.

We would watch movies on his bed, and he would pull me close and stare at me as I watched emotional scenes, hugging me tightly while I cried. Whenever we went clubbing, we were always in a corner, kissing each other while I sat on his lap, we would take pictures of ourselves kissing. We had wine nights, coffee nights, night drives.

Learning to ""lock in"" to the frequency that matches what you want to experience.

This isn't about positive thinking or wishful dreaming. It's about something much more practical and powerful.

## Breaking Down the Frequency Lock Method 📡

### What Does ""Locking a Frequency"" Actually Mean?

Imagine you're tuning into your favorite radio station. If you keep moving the dial, you'll get static and broken signals. But when you lock onto the exact frequency, the music comes through crystal clear.

Your personal frequency is the combination of:
- Your dominant thoughts throughout the day
- Your emotional baseline (how you typically feel)
- Your behavioral patterns and habits
- Your expectations about what's possible for you

When these elements align consistently around a specific outcome or lifestyle, you've ""locked in"" to that frequency.

### The Reshaping Process: How Reality Reorganizes 🔄

Here's where it gets fascinating. When you maintain a consistent internal frequency, something remarkable happens in your external world:

**Week 1-2:** You start noticing opportunities and resources you previously overlooked
**Week 3-4:** Your behavior naturally shifts to align with your locked-in frequency
**Month 2-3:** Other people begin responding to you differently
**Month 3-6:** Circumstances, opportunities, and outcomes start reorganizing around your new baseline

This isn't mystical - it's the natural result of consistent focus directing your attention, energy, and actions toward specific outcomes.

## The Three Pillars of Frequency Mastery 🏛️

### Pillar 1: Emotional Baseline Management 💭

Your emotional state is like the carrier wave for everything else. Here's how to manage it practically:

**Morning Calibration (5 minutes):**
- Before checking your phone, sit quietly and consciously choose how you want to feel today
- Focus on the sensation of already having what you're working toward
- Lock in this feeling before external inputs can shift your frequency

**Midday Reset (2 minutes):**
- Check in with your emotional state
- If you've drifted from your chosen frequency, gently guide yourself back
- Use physical movement or deep breathing to shift energy if needed

**Evening Reflection (3 minutes):**
- Review how well you maintained your chosen frequency
- Identify what helped you stay locked in and what knocked you off course
- Set tomorrow's frequency intention

### Pillar 2: Behavioral Alignment 🎬

Your actions must match your internal frequency, or you'll create static in your signal:

**Identity-Based Actions:**
- Ask yourself: ""What would someone who already has [your goal] do in this situation?""
- Make decisions from that perspective, even in small daily choices
- Gradually expand these aligned behaviors until they become automatic

**Environmental Design:**
- Organize your physical space to reinforce your chosen frequency
- Surround yourself with visual and auditory cues that support your target state
- Remove or minimize elements that pull you toward old patterns

### Pillar 3: Expectation Programming 🧠

Your expectations act like a filter, determining what you notice and how you interpret events:

**Possibility Expansion:**
- Regularly expose yourself to examples of people who've achieved what you're working toward
- Study the practical steps and mindsets that led to their results
- Normalize success in your mental landscape

**Evidence Collection:**
- Keep a daily log of small wins and positive developments
- Notice and record moments when reality seems to be reorganizing in your favor
- Build a evidence base that supports your new expectations

## The Echo Effect: Why Life Responds to Consistency 🔊

When you maintain a frequency long enough, life begins to ""echo"" it back through:

**Changed Perception:** You start seeing opportunities that were always there but invisible to your previous frequency

**Behavioral Shifts:** Your actions naturally align with your locked-in state, leading to different outcomes

**Social Resonance:** People respond to your consistent energy, opening new doors and connections

**Circumstantial Alignment:** Events and timing seem to work in your favor more frequently

## Practical Implementation: Your 30-Day Frequency Lock Challenge 📅

### Week 1: Frequency Identification
- Define exactly what frequency you want to lock into
- Identify the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that match this frequency
- Begin practicing 10 minutes of conscious frequency alignment daily

### Week 2: Signal Strengthening
- Extend your daily practice to 20 minutes
- Add midday frequency checks
- Start making small decisions from your target frequency

### Week 3: Environmental Tuning
- Adjust your physical environment to support your frequency
- Begin acting ""as if"" in larger decisions
- Document changes you notice in how others respond to you

### Week 4: Stabilization and Evidence
- Maintain your frequency even when challenged by external circumstances
- Collect evidence of reality beginning to reorganize
- Plan how to extend and deepen your practice

## Common Frequency Disruptions and Solutions ⚡

### The Doubt Storm
**Problem:** Old thought patterns creating static in your signal
**Solution:** Acknowledge doubts without engaging them. Return to your chosen frequency like tuning back to your radio station

### Social Frequency Interference
**Problem:** Other people's energy pulling you off your frequency
**Solution:** Practice maintaining your signal strength around others. Set energetic boundaries

### Results Impatience
**Problem:** Checking for changes disrupts the frequency lock
**Solution:** Focus on maintaining consistency rather than monitoring outcomes. Trust the process

## The Non-Chase Approach: Why Forcing Doesn't Work 🚫

Traditional goal-chasing creates resistance because it operates from a frequency of ""lacking"" what you want. This sends mixed signals:
- Your actions say you want something
- Your energy says you don't have it
- Reality responds to the energy, not the actions

The frequency lock method works because it operates from a baseline of already having achieved the internal state you're seeking. External changes then follow naturally.

## Advanced Frequency Techniques 🚀

### Frequency Stacking
Layer multiple compatible frequencies to create compound effects:
- Physical health frequency + career success frequency
- Relationship harmony frequency + financial abundance frequency

### Micro-Frequency Adjustments
Make tiny frequency shifts throughout the day:
- Shift from ""trying to"" to ""choosing to""
- Move from ""hoping for"" to ""expecting""
- Change from ""working toward"" to ""becoming""

### Group Frequency Amplification
Connect with others operating on similar frequencies to strengthen your signal and accelerate results.

## Measuring Your Progress: Frequency Indicators 📊

**Strong Signal Indicators:**
- Decisions feel natural and aligned
- Opportunities appear with increasing frequency
- People respond positively to your energy
- Circumstances flow more smoothly
- You feel calm confidence rather than anxious excitement

**Weak Signal Indicators:**
- Constant mental effort required to maintain your state
- External resistance seems to increase
- Energy feels forced or artificial
- Progress feels slow or blocked

## The 400-Year Test: Timeless Principles 🕰️

These principles work because they're based on fundamental aspects of human psychology and behavior that remain constant across centuries:

- Consistency shapes neural pathways and habits
- Focused attention directs energy and action
- Emotional states influence perception and decision-making
- Behavioral alignment creates momentum and results
- Social dynamics respond to authentic confidence and clarity

## Building Your Personal Frequency Practice 🏗️

### Daily Minimums:
- 5 minutes morning frequency setting
- 3 midday frequency checks
- 2 minutes evening reflection

### Weekly Expansion:
- One longer frequency practice session (30-60 minutes)
- Review and adjust your approach based on results
- Plan the following week's frequency focus

### Monthly Evolution:
- Assess overall progress and patterns
- Upgrade your frequency target if appropriate
- Refine your techniques based on what works best for you

## Integration Into Modern Life 🌐

This approach works within any lifestyle or belief system because it's based on practical psychology rather than specific worldview assumptions:

**For the Scientist:** It's about consistency in thought patterns affecting behavior and outcomes
**For the Pragmatist:** It's about focused effort and clear intention creating results
**For the Skeptic:** It's about psychological priming and behavioral consistency
**For the Believer:** It's about aligning inner and outer experience

## Troubleshooting Common Challenges 🔧

### ""I Keep Forgetting to Practice""
- Link frequency checks to existing habits
- Set phone reminders for the first 30 days
- Start with just one minute practices

### ""I Don't See Any Changes""
- Focus on internal consistency first
- Look for subtle shifts in how you feel and think
- External changes often lag behind internal shifts by 30-90 days

### ""Other People Think I'm Being Unrealistic""
- Keep your practice private until it's well-established
- Let results speak louder than explanations
- Find supportive communities online or in person

## The Compound Effect of Frequency Mastery 📈

The most powerful aspect of this approach is its compound nature. Each day you maintain your frequency:
- Strengthens your ability to maintain it
- Makes external alignment more likely
- Builds evidence that supports continued practice
- Creates momentum that becomes self-sustaining

## Your Next Steps: From Theory to Practice 👣

1. **Choose Your Frequency:** Define the internal state and external reality you want to lock into
2. **Design Your Practice:** Create simple, daily routines for maintaining this frequency
3. **Start Small:** Begin with 5-10 minutes daily rather than trying to change everything at once
4. **Track Patterns:** Notice what helps you maintain consistency and what disrupts it
5. **Trust the Process:** Focus on maintaining the frequency rather than monitoring results

## The Ultimate Freedom: Choice Over Circumstance 🦋

Mastering this frequency approach gives you something invaluable: the ability to choose your experience regardless of external circumstances. When you can lock into any frequency at will, you're no longer at the mercy of random events or other people's energy.

You become the architect of your own experience, designing your reality from the inside out.

The transformation isn't instant, but it's inevitable when you understand and apply these principles consistently. Your life will begin to reorganize around the frequency you choose to maintain, not because of magic, but because of the natural relationship between consistent inner states and external outcomes.

Start today. Choose your frequency. Lock it in. Let life reshape itself around your unwavering signal.

The only question is: what frequency will you choose to broadcast? 🎵

The only way I'd think hed be summoned is at an ungodly hour start chanting “saga saga sagazinasss” three times in the mirror while wearing a blonde wig.
Prepare butter coffee and popcorn on the side as sacred offerings. Replay kit walker edits on loop like a subliminal and finally, whispering to his spirit that Ryan Murphy isn’t around… so it’s safe to come out.

My PC's ethernet connection keeps disconnecting for no reason. It will reconnect right away at times and at other times it will switch to Wi-Fi on its own. It might go away for a month or two, and then it will start happening again. It's strange, but the problem goes away when I remove my RAM sticks and put them back in. I called Acer but they didn't really help. I don't know if this is a problem with the motherboard or something else.
