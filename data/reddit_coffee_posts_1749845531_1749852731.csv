\- poetry (would die for it, always on a lookout for more poems - i write actively, can take your challenge to write on stuff)  
\- movies and television (the more the better)  
\- literature (only did an unimportant degree in it)  
\- languages (so far 4 learnt, good going, more to come)  
\- music (can sing decent, i have been told)  
\- philosophy and questions of life (questions remain the same, answers vary?)

i am open to new experiences and new people, so long as they are not meeting on a superficial level and actually are genuine persons through and through. 

oh, and i am a coffee fanatic, so good cafe suggestions are always welcome. 

feel free to DM!

I work a 9-5 so what I do is this these days and have had very good luck staying in my target weight range... No science to it really:

Pack a normal ""lunch"" (for me this is a large sandwich, chips, apple, milk, a bag of peanuts, and a cookie... maybe one other thing). 

Skip lunch and snack on the peanuts until lunch. Maybe have some office snacks like a few granola bars or break into your lunch early

Then eat most of your lunch... try to leave a thing or two (leave the sugar and milk for 3pm). 

Then at 3, eat the sugary stuff to hold you over to dinner

Then eat a real proper like 800 cal dinner. Eat your plates worth. DO NOT GET SECONDS. If you want seconds, wait (and I kid you not) another 3 hours. If you ate dinner at 6pm, then eat the seconds at like 9pm or 8pm (my stomach is fine going to sleep full). 

Do this pretty much every day and you're golden! Try some coffee too and drink a lot of water and this will be kinda easier. 

Best of luck :D",0,1749852476.0,loseit,1,0.5,False
1lasjjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/1lasjjz/actions_and_consequences/,Actions and Consequences,"What a wild time we live in. The topsy turvy of the world we are living in can make a persons stomach lurch with the best of any rollercoaster. I’m not here to harp on anyone about whether they did or didn’t vote for him or her. I’m not here to tell anyone to protest or to stay home. Because the fact is, it’s not up to me to get on a soapbox and tell you what to do. What I will say is what I told my son…there are consequences to every action, good or bad. We all have a choice to make. It’s not my place to pass judgement on your choices, the way you vote, your religious views, who you love, where you live or where you come from. I was raised in NW Iowa and reside in central Iowa now. The difference in politics in that 2 1/2 to 3 hour drive is epic. I do place blame for a huge part of the chaos in the world today on social media (which seems to become more of an online war zone than anything social) and the media’s inability to have honest bipartisan coverage of any story. My dad is a Vietnam veteran, and he told me something once that has stuck with me: bloody headlines sell. If you decide to protest this weekend, remember the consequences to every action part and that I’m not telling you what to do. The consequences could be dire, but in a better world (which I hope will come), cooler heads prevail, people can remember what it’s like to have a conversation instead of shout, and that we can all learn to live in the same operating space again. Disagreement is good, but keep it to healthy conversation. Make your voice heard, but don’t lose your voice screaming your message. Remember to stand for what you believe in without trampling on others. Try to remember that tolerance is necessary even when acceptance feels impossible. I still believe in Iowa Nice, but my Iowa Nice may be a bit old school…sitting at the farmers grain elevator with a cup of coffee and talking about politics, the world, the markets…and then having a good laugh about something funny…and then telling everyone to have a good day, enjoy the weather, hope for rain, rinse my cup and leave with a smile on my face.",1,1749852393.0,desmoines,0,1.0,False

1lasgtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lasgtj/friend_keeps_expecting_me_to_pay/,Friend Keeps Expecting Me to Pay?,"Looking for some advice - I have a friend, who is 5 years younger than me, and we used to be pretty good at splitting things, or one of us would pay one day, the other the next... but lately, that's changed. The last time we went to eat out, they went to the bathroom, and while they were gone, the waiter came over and asked me to pay - I was a little taken aback, but felt under pressure to pay, as I was being looked at expectantly. When the friend returned, they didn't offer to reimburse me, just acted surprised and nodded. As a note, they've been to this place before, I had not, and it wasn't cheap.

And then last week it happened again - we were at a local place, and they claimed her online banking wasn't working... and asked me if I would pay for her coffee. I was a bit taken aback but agreed - and then they ordered a second drink, too, without asking if it was ok. Because it was a local place, I didn't want to cause a fuss so I ended up paying, as Ive been that person who has had to decline getting something because of card issues.

But then we went somewhere *after* the cafe, the same day, and suddenly their online banking stuff was working again. They didn't offer to pay me back, acted like the whole thing had never happened, and only paid for their own coffee.

Now I feel weird. I don't make a lot of money and have made clear that I am not a rich person, but this is the second time I've been put out of pocket, and I don't really know how to deal with it without getting confrontational.

1lasgcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lasgcr/aio_cuckolded_on_a_first_date/,AIO: Cuckolded on a first date?,"So I (30M) have been talking to this hostess (31F) I met for about three weeks. The first night we exchanged Snapchat. We literally spent the entire night talking and snapping each other. But after the second week or so I noticed she was infrequently texting back and I asked if she was no longer interested or met someone else. Which is all fine. I just wanted to know for clarity so I don’t text her anymore if I’m bugging her. She got defensive and said no she’s just busy with work and stuff and we didn’t talk for three days until I apologized and she said she just needed time to think what she wants at this point. We didn’t go on a first date until the following week, which was the third week and this previous Wednesday.*

⸻

1. Park Pick-Up
	•	Time: Early evening, Wednesday, you were eating at a restaurant alone and showing her a screenshot of a music festival she wants to go to next month and saying that could be a fun date idea.
	•	You received her out of the blue “let’s go out tonight!” immediately after this exchange and rushed home to get ready.
	•	She said her brother (apparently they lived together at age 30) and her just had margaritas at home and he was being lame and went to bed but she doesn’t want to go to bed yet.
	•	Setting: You drove to the park she picked because she said she wasn’t comfortable letting guys know where she lives on a first date. She also said she didn’t have her car tonight that her brother and her share and as you drove there she kept rushing you saying “she’s going to go to bed soon if you’re not here” and spamming “tick tok” to hurry you. She also sent you nudes to “motivate” you to rush. You arrived, hugged, and she climbed in. You showed her the original bar that you wanted to go to and she immediately vetoed so you showed her a list of other bars and she only pushed for one of the bars on the list. You thought it was odd she was so eager for this one bar, but didn’t think anything of it at the time.

⸻

2. Arrival at Saloon
	•	First Minute (0–1 min in):
	•	You both go to sit down at the bar and she immediately says hey to one of the gentleman at the bar and tells you this is one of her regular customers at the restaurant she waitresses at down the road. You politely suggested she sit next to him and I’d sit on the other side, assuming they’d chat for a few minutes before your date resumed.
	•	Her body immediately pivots almost a full 90° away from you—hips, knees, torso all squarely facing the bar-owner guy.
	•	You only see the back of her hair; not even her cheek for almost the entire 90 minutes you were there.

⸻

3. “Just Hanging Out” (1–5 min)
	•	The bar owner asks, “What are you two doing here?”
	•	She responds, “Just hanging out,” deliberately omitting any mention of “date.”

⸻

4. Flirtatious Touching Begins (~5–10 min)
	•	As the bar owner talks, she reaches out repeatedly—placing her hand on his arm, brushing his leg, laughing into his shoulder.
	•	Her attention is fully on him, not on you. Her body is turned away and the music is blasting so her voice isn’t projecting to you and you can’t even make out every third word of the conversation. You try to interject and make conversation where you can but it’s difficult with not hearing the conversation and she doesn’t even motion to you, or turn her head whenever you do speak. She is constantly grabbing his arms or legs when talking to him as well.

⸻

5. First-Date Question & Face-Cover (~10–15 min)
	•	Bar owner turns to you and her: “So… is this a first date?” You answer “yes.” This is the second time in ten minutes he asked what you two were doing.
	•	She covers her face and eyes with her hand for several minutes, silently enduring the question.
	•	After 2–3 minutes of stony silence and you two awkwardly exchanging looks, she finally mumbles, “Can we move on?”

⸻

6. High-School Friend’s Arrival (~20–25 min)
	•	Her Florida high-school friend and that friend’s boyfriend walk in. The odds of her friend from Florida randomly being at this bar in Ohio on a Wednesday night is unlikely and possibly suggests they coordinated.
	•	She leans in to hug her friend, introduces briefly, then says, “Mind if I hang out with her? I haven’t seen her since Florida.”
	•	You agree, hoping this will reset the dynamic and let her have fun for a bit. You also hoped she’d invite you over to socialize with the four of you—but she grabs her drink and goes down to the other side of the bar.

⸻

7. First Seating Shift
	•	She slides down the bar stool: her friend on her left, the bar owner on her right.
	•	You find yourself two seats away—visibly isolated. The boyfriend chats with you for 20 minutes, perhaps to distract or politely include you.

⸻

8. Purse Retrieval Request (~35–40 min)
	•	She says, “Hey I need something out of my purse from your car, can I grab it?”
	•	You retrieve the purse and return it. In hindsight, you believe she did this to have her purse on her, ready.

⸻

9. Bathroom Break with Purse (Immediate)
	•	She and her female friend head into the bathroom together—purse in hand.
	•	You remain at the bar with the bar owner and her friend’s boyfriend.

⸻

10. Friends Depart (~1 hr in)
	•	Her friend’s boyfriend says goodbye. Her friend and he leave the bar. You realize she’s talking face-to-face with the bar owner.
	•	She slowly and reluctantly returns to the seat next to you and says, “Well this isn’t how I saw our first date happening.” You agree and she senses your frustration. After twenty seconds, she says, “Hey I’m probably going to stay out a little longer with my friend.” You respond, “Oh, you don’t need a ride home then?” She says no. You chuckle, pay for both drinks, give an awkward handshake with “Well, put it there partner,” and leave—assuming she’d join her friend outside.

⸻

11. Next Day
	•	You texted her friend’s boyfriend the next morning. He said that when he and his girlfriend left, they spent the night alone and never saw her again. She never rejoined them—she stayed behind, likely with the bar owner (whose apartment is upstairs).
	•	You then text her:
“Hey how did the rest of your night go after I left? Did you end up just crashing at your friend’s place after hanging out with her? I wasn’t sure how you were planning on getting home lol”
	•	She replied: “Yeah we just hung out drank some more and I crashed at her place.”
	•	You asked, “Oh cool—did he stay up with you?” She said, “Yeah! He stayed up for a bit and then went to bed.”
	•	In reality, the boyfriend has no reason to lie: she did not spend the night with them.

⸻

ChatGPT Key takeaways from this sequence:
	•	Immediate, complete physical re-orientation toward someone else.
	•	Persistent, flirtatious touching of the bar owner’s arm and leg.
	•	Prolonged face-cover when confronted about being on a date.
	•	Social and physical isolation of you—two seat shifts, bathroom subterfuge, departure alone.




OK, so now that is the whole timeline. And I fully realize I’m going to get the “Yeah I don’t think she likes you.” comments. I think that is an understatement. I’m just generally curious on what the heck even happened!? Like I gave her so many outs before beforehand saying we didn’t have to talk or go on a date or we could move on if she wasn’t interested. Did she literally spend a month and dozens of hours of talking just to get a six minute Uber ride to her friend’s bar and two beers out of me? Did she just have plans that night with this guy and needed a ride since he was drinking at the bar and I basically drove her to another date? It’s just so crazy because she complained that her exes would always gaslight her and lied to her and she told me that she is very honest and isn’t talking or hooking up with anyone else. (which she can because we didn’t even have our first date at the time)

But it just seems crazy to me that she literally ended up sleeping with another guy (99% chance) on OUR date. Well, I mean, she couldn’t even admit it was a date to the bar owner lol. We have seen each other in person before and have snapped hundreds of times so it’s not like she was turned off when she saw me. The car ride to the bar was pretty normal and fun and light. She quite literally never gave me a chance because as soon as she sat down at the bar, she didn’t look at me or even really talk to me the rest of the night. It’s not like I said something weird at the bar right away that turned her off… I quite literally never got a chance for me to mess something up that quick. I gave her plenty of easy outs before this if she wasn’t interested or attracted, she was the one randomly eager to see me this night. Did she just want to go out with her  friends/date and had me as a ride? Are there any ladies out there that could maybe clear up what you think happened to her? Did I just basically get used for a ride, two beers, and attention? I was just showing her about these music concerts that we should go to, and if she wanted to burn our relationship, I didn’t think she would burn it by using me as an Uber one time. I do want to confront her either on the phone or asking to go for coffee. What do you guys make of all of this?

TL;DR- You’d been Snapchat‐flirting with this hostess for three weeks before she suddenly went quiet after a joking “side-piece” comment and asked for space.
	2.	After apologizing, she agreed to a spur-of-the-moment first date Wednesday night and you drove her (no car) to a bar she’d recommended.
	3.	Within seconds of sitting down, she physically pivoted 90° to face a regular bar owner, greeting and touching him nonstop while ignoring you.
	4.	When he asked if it was a date, she covered her face for several minutes and then insisted they “move on.”
	5.	Her high-school friend and boyfriend arrived later, and she slid down the bar to sit between them and the bar owner, isolating you two seats away.
	6.	She sent you to fetch her purse from your car—then disappeared into the bathroom with her friend.
	7.	After her friend left, she told you she’d stay “hanging out,” and you later learned from that friend’s boyfriend she never rejoined them.
	8.	The next day she lied about crashing at her friend’s, but the boyfriend confirmed she actually stayed behind—almost certainly with the bar owner above the bar.
What in the world actually happened that night from an omniscient POV? A month just for a 6 minute ride to the bar and 2 drinks? Why go through all this? Or am I misreading something and she is just rude and not legitimately deceitful/evil?",0,1749852159.0,AmIOverreacting,6,0.5,False

	•	She says, “Hey I need something out of my purse from your car, can I grab it?”
	•	You retrieve the purse and return it. In hindsight, you believe she did this to have her purse on her, ready.

⸻

9. Bathroom Break with Purse (Immediate)
	•	She and her female friend head into the bathroom together—purse in hand.
	•	You remain at the bar with the bar owner and her friend’s boyfriend.

⸻

10. Friends Depart (~1 hr in)
	•	Her friend’s boyfriend says goodbye. Her friend and he leave the bar. You realize she’s talking face-to-face with the bar owner.
	•	She slowly and reluctantly returns to the seat next to you and says, “Well this isn’t how I saw our first date happening.” You agree and she senses your frustration. After twenty seconds, she says, “Hey I’m probably going to stay out a little longer with my friend.” You respond, “Oh, you don’t need a ride home then?” She says no. You chuckle, pay for both drinks, give an awkward handshake with “Well, put it there partner,” and leave—assuming she’d join her friend outside.

⸻

11. Next Day
	•	You texted her friend’s boyfriend the next morning. He said that when he and his girlfriend left, they spent the night alone and never saw her again. She never rejoined them—she stayed behind, likely with the bar owner (whose apartment is upstairs).
	•	You then text her:
“Hey how did the rest of your night go after I left? Did you end up just crashing at your friend’s place after hanging out with her? I wasn’t sure how you were planning on getting home lol”
	•	She replied: “Yeah we just hung out drank some more and I crashed at her place.”
	•	You asked, “Oh cool—did he stay up with you?” She said, “Yeah! He stayed up for a bit and then went to bed.”
	•	In reality, the boyfriend has no reason to lie: she did not spend the night with them.

⸻

ChatGPT Key takeaways from this sequence:
	•	Immediate, complete physical re-orientation toward someone else.
	•	Persistent, flirtatious touching of the bar owner’s arm and leg.
	•	Prolonged face-cover when confronted about being on a date.
	•	Social and physical isolation of you—two seat shifts, bathroom subterfuge, departure alone.




OK, so now that is the whole timeline. And I fully realize I’m going to get the “Yeah I don’t think she likes you.” comments. I think that is an understatement. I’m just generally curious on what the heck even happened!? Like I gave her so many outs before beforehand saying we didn’t have to talk or go on a date or we could move on if she wasn’t interested. Did she literally spend a month and dozens of hours of talking just to get a six minute Uber ride to her friend’s bar and two beers out of me? Did she just have plans that night with this guy and needed a ride since he was drinking at the bar and I basically drove her to another date? It’s just so crazy because she complained that her exes would always gaslight her and lied to her and she told me that she is very honest and isn’t talking or hooking up with anyone else. (which she can because we didn’t even have our first date at the time)

But it just seems crazy to me that she literally ended up sleeping with another guy (99% chance) on OUR date. Well, I mean, she couldn’t even admit it was a date to the bar owner lol. We have seen each other in person before and have snapped hundreds of times so it’s not like she was turned off when she saw me. The car ride to the bar was pretty normal and fun and light. She quite literally never gave me a chance because as soon as she sat down at the bar, she didn’t look at me or even really talk to me the rest of the night. It’s not like I said something weird at the bar right away that turned her off… I quite literally never got a chance for me to mess something up that quick. I gave her plenty of easy outs before this if she wasn’t interested or attracted, she was the one randomly eager to see me this night. Did she just want to go out with her  friends/date and had me as a ride? Are there any ladies out there that could maybe clear up what you think happened to her? Did I just basically get used for a ride, two beers, and attention? I was just showing her about these music concerts that we should go to, and if she wanted to burn our relationship, I didn’t think she would burn it by using me as an Uber one time. I do want to confront her either on the phone or asking to go for coffee. What do you guys make of all of this?

TL;DR- You’d been Snapchat‐flirting with this hostess for three weeks before she suddenly went quiet after a joking “side-piece” comment and asked for space.
	2.	After apologizing, she agreed to a spur-of-the-moment first date Wednesday night and you drove her (no car) to a bar she’d recommended.
	3.	Within seconds of sitting down, she physically pivoted 90° to face a regular bar owner, greeting and touching him nonstop while ignoring you.
	4.	When he asked if it was a date, she covered her face for several minutes and then insisted they “move on.”
	5.	Her high-school friend and boyfriend arrived later, and she slid down the bar to sit between them and the bar owner, isolating you two seats away.
	6.	She sent you to fetch her purse from your car—then disappeared into the bathroom with her friend.
	7.	After her friend left, she told you she’d stay “hanging out,” and you later learned from that friend’s boyfriend she never rejoined them.
	8.	The next day she lied about crashing at her friend’s, but the boyfriend confirmed she actually stayed behind—almost certainly with the bar owner above the bar.
What in the world actually happened that night from an omniscient POV? A month just for a 6 minute ride to the bar and 2 drinks? Why go through all this? Or am I misreading something and she is just rude and not legitimately deceitful/evil?",1,1749851970.0,rant,4,1.0,False

1las8nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FattyLiverNAFLD/comments/1las8nu/diagnosed_with_fatty_liver_at_27_years_old/,Diagnosed with fatty liver at 27 years old,"Hello everyone.

I am a 28 year old man, weigh 73/74 kg and I am 1.69 m tall, and in November 2024 I did the routine tests and the following values ​​were detected:

\-Sideremia 174

\-Vitamin D 9.68

\-Total Birilubin 2.10

\-Direct Birilubin 0.60

\-Indirect Birilubin 1.50

\-G.O.T. Transaminase 47

\-G.P.T. Transaminase 106

\-Gamma GT 56

In addition to these, the hormonal values ​​are also not optimal: LH 2.48, FSH 2.38, Testosterone 3.46, Testosterone-Free 22.2.

Following these values ​​I decided to do an abdominal ultrasound and what came out was: liver increased in volume and heterogeneous echostructure from moderate steatosis without evidence of focal lesions in progress. Ergo fatty liver.

Months have passed since the diagnosis and I have changed some habits:

\-I usually drank beers or cocktails every Wednesday and Saturday night. I have eliminated alcohol.

\- I drank Redbull almost every day. Now I only drink it on Saturday afternoon.

\- I drank coffee with two spoons of sugar. Today I continue to drink coffee but with sweetener.

What I have not been able to change:

\- When I have dinner with friends on Wednesday and Saturday night I continue to go to McDonalds;

\- Unfortunately I have the bad habit of eating at night, for example: biscuits, chocolate or crackers (even though before I tended to eat worse such as what was left from dinner)

\- Every day for lunch and dinner I drink Coca Cola, even if I have switched to the zero sugar version.

Hello, baby. 

I look up, and there she is, my darling. 

I smile the second I hear her voice. That voice, that smile… always had a way of knocking me to my knees.

""Took you long enough,"" I tease, even though I've only been waiting a few minutes. 

""Baby, I'm so sorry, I fell asleep,"" she says. 

I pull her into a hug.

""It's okay,"" I whisper. ""I've just been sitting here, enjoying my beer."" 

I ask if she wants a drink. She gives me a look like, of course I do. She orders her dirty martini, and as she talks, I can't help but watch her. Listening to every word like I can't breathe without it. 

""So,"" she says, pulling me back to the moment, ""how was your day?"" 

I tell her how I got off work, tore off my uniform, jumped in the shower, and drove like hell to be with her. 

We talk about anything and everything for thirty minutes before leaving the bar and heading to a little video café around the corner. On the way, a homeless woman stops us and asks for cash. She gives her some money with no hesitation. That's one of the things I've always loved about her. She's kind to a world that hasn't always been kind to her.

The woman looks at me and says, ""I'm sorry for disrespecting you and asking your wife for money."" I smile.

""It's okay. No worries at all.""

My wife... I like the ring of that, I think to myself.

We laugh about it, walking back to the hotel, her hand in mine like it's all just easy.

Our next day started bright and early at 7 am with a kiss, coffee, and pastries. 

""What would you like to do today, my dear."" I ask 

Without hesitation, she says ""I want to check out Geneva, I hear it's this super cute beach kinda vibe town."" 

On the hour a half long drive, we shared our music tastes, which were almost the same. That was the fastest hour a half drive of my entire life. Hand in hand, singing our hearts out together, and stealing kisses from her when we stopped. 

Before I know it, we're pulling in the Geneva welcome center. 

Without realizing it, hours pass with wine and cheese and stories from a wild man who talks like the world never stopped spinning for him. Afterward, we sit on a bench looking out, quiet, watching the sun touch the water. 

Then she breaks the silence and asks,

""Do you have any doubts about us?""

I look at her and admit, ""Yeah… just the distance.""

She frowns. ""You're not worried about the age gap?"" 

I shake my head and take her hand. ""Not really, baby."" 

Then her eyes drop. ""There's a lot of question marks in your life.""

 I nod. ""That's true. But I'll be in the Army for two more years. After that, we'll have it easy."" 

She looks at me gentle but profound. ""But what will you do for work?"" 

""I'm not sure,"" I admit. ""But I've got time to figure it out."" 

Her voice softens. ""I don't want you to cater your life around me. What if you wake up and realize this isn't what you want?"" 

I hold her gaze. ""I know it sounds stupid, but this is the most sure I've ever been about anything.""

I couldn't hear her reply. Not really. Just the sound of my own heart cracking a little.

Tears gather in her eyes.

""I really, really like you,"" she says.

I brace for it.

""But I'm not sure I can commit to this… to anyone… right now.""

I sit in the moment for a second, broken but understanding. She had just come out of a long-term relationship 8 months ago. This isn't about me. It's about timing. It's about healing.

I don't cry. Not yet. That'll come tomorrow. 

We head back to the hotel and spend the rest of the day watching trashy reality shows and enjoying each other's company. 

Morning arrives too fast. It's time for her to fly home. We already made plans to see each other again, but deep down, I fear this will be the last time.

I kiss her.

She kisses me back like she can't live without it.

Yuri didn’t stir even once as I crawled under the covers and pushed myself down the length of the mattress on my elbows to slink out the other end. Not even when my arms would graze her hips or thighs as I did so. Classes for her second semester had already started at university and she was already swimming in essays and library books, so she probably needed the sleep.

I did this every morning for those five days in Kyoto, and snatched my heavy corduroy coat and scarf, which smelled so heavily of patchouli I couldn’t wash it out, to head out on the small veranda. I’d blame the jetlag for making me wake up too early for my comfort, but the view of early January mist hanging over the surrounding mountains was worth it.

Since the day I was born, I was destined to visit my father’s hometown in Gifu that year, because I would turn 20 and be dolled up for my coming-of-age ceremony. So I asked (begged really) my father to let me spend a few days in Kyoto, a place I dreamt of visiting for a very long time. He didn’t want me to travel alone, but in the end I was able to convince him by telling him I’d stay at Yuri’s and promising to call him every night.

My father and I hadn’t been back to Japan since his sister passed away 8 years before, where I met my grandmother the first time at the funeral. This dead aunt of mine, who I’ve only seen in the form of an acrylic painting of a teenage girl in a pale green mohair cardigan, which now hung in my closet, had a closed casket funeral. The picture of her that hung above her casket was exactly like the portrait I knew, but with fatter cheeks and hollower eyes. It was a domestic homicide apparently, and the lacerations that cut deep into her skull along with the contusions on her right side made her unpresentable. The boyfriend supposedly didn’t even flee when the police investigated the reports of screaming, and he just sat with his knife on the dinner table as he was arrested.

I stood to the side after she was cremated, and watched as my father and grandmother picked up pieces of her bone fragments from the mounds of ash and placed them in a lacquer urn. I wanted to slip away and run.

The only words that my grandmother said, not to me but in reference to me, was: “she looks exactly like that whore.” My father said she died about 2 years after my aunt’s funeral, which he only told me a few nights before our departure when I asked him why we were booking a hotel, as he looked over at his sister’s urn which sat at the foot of the framed portrait.

My father dressed me in an inherited kimono, maple red with gold, black and green accents. After I attended the shrine on an early January day to commemorate the beginning of my adulthood, got my picture taken until the heavy obi around my waist crushed all my guts, and wiped off my make-up that included the most stubborn crimson lipstick, I packed up the next day for my trip to Yuri’s apartment.

Yuri was also an American-born Japanese girl who moved to the town I was raised in, but she was born in a nicer, wealthier city with more highrise buildings than mine, a better mall than mine and grocery stores with nicer murals than mine, and was the pretty transfer student in my 4th grade class. She was reserved, a bit gloomy (but in an intellectual way, not the incomprehensible way), and never smiled with all her teeth, which I thought was a shame because they were charmingly crooked.

So when I asked Yuri to let me stay at her apartment in the Sakyo-ku ward, I was pleased she agreed to let me. We barely communicated since she flew off to Japan to finish high school, mostly due to the 13-hour time difference, and calling her a friend was unfamiliar to me by the time 6 years had passed. We talked mostly about the weather and tourist spots and reminiscing about the past in her narrow apartment.

She didn’t seem to want to talk about herself much at first. I did, however, hear her soft voice waver slightly louder than usual while she took a call in the opposite corner of the room one evening, on the other side of the bookshelf lined with depressing literature. She said something along the lines of “Why would you say that,” and “I’m sorry.” Yuri later explained that it was her boyfriend. From the few short descriptions she gave, I figured this boyfriend was the suffering-artist asshole type, full of hidden egotism and feigning empathetic tendencies. Like he had lost himself in an act of self-pity and woeful masochism. She then told me he was a decade older than her and I retched inaudibly.

I took long strolls along The Philosopher’s Path, watching the guillotined heads of red camellias roll in the winter breeze along the steep hills that lead to temples, and found no need to strain my ear to hear silence. Occasionally, I’d hear a wind chime or the rhythmic sweeps of a broom in the distance. Most of the shops around the older neighborhoods would be open, the ones run by the elders with a cold shoulder and warm hands. I strayed from the main roads. I followed gray herons that led me through illustrative gardens, looking back at me every now and then to make sure I followed. I dozed off under awnings at temples during light rain, listening to their suikinkutsu until a monk had to rouse me awake with his gentle voice.

Then I stumbled upon that thing in the suirokaku aqueduct on the fourth day.

I made the decision to go to this aqueduct after speaking to a waitress at the ramshackle tofu shop who recommended it. I didn’t know how an aqueduct could hold a candle to the shrines and temples I was enraptured by, but I went anyway. I’ll admit it was a beautiful aqueduct bridge built in Meiji era Japan, but I was soon wandering off to see what else I could stumble across in the area. It was noon and I was hoping to walk off my lunch, tanuki udon with a side of fresh kara’age, and a trail on the top of the bridge led into a forested area.

There was a smaller path that branched off the trail, that was closed off by some signs about wild monkeys and landslides that I ignored. It was a small chain link fence, only about three feet wide, and nailed into the path that sloped down into a small incline on the sides that I could easily maneuver around. I thought little of it, as I swung myself comically around, grabbing the metal post with my hand outstretched like I was Singin’ in the Rain.

The overcast skies amplified the green in the leaves, and the moss on the damp trees seemed to glow neon against dark tree barks. I tried to describe the scent of wet stone in my head while my hands grew a little colder, pinker, and stiffer.

I stayed on the trail for a good twenty minutes or so, but something in the distance caught my eye. A steeper hill down on my left looked to lead out into a stone path that was perpendicular to the trail. At the end of it was a carnelian torii gate, which was hard to miss, and it stood a bit slanted to one side. I was ecstatic to find an abandoned temple and figured that by making my way around the most sturdy looking trunks like an octopus in a pinball machine, I could descend down to the stone path in three, maybe four minutes.

I wasn’t looking around much as I grabbed onto the wet trunks, surprisingly warm in my cold hands, and made sure I’m watching where my feet go, especially with the wet soil. It wasn’t muddy, but a wrong shift of weight felt like it could end in a tumble. The heavy canopy prevented a lot of the raindrops from falling through, but I figured it didn’t hurt to be cautious.

Once my boots finally hit solid ground, my soul shook inside my hollowed-out body. It was like all my guts and bones and flesh were gone and it’s just this animalistic instinct that itches to escape my husk. I’m certain that the trees are ensnaring me, so I quicken my pace down the stone path, determined I watched too many horror movies.

Everything that goes into building places like this have symbolism, some meaning. I was flanked by the two komainu dogs stationed in front of the temple, but both guardians were missing their mouths, or rather their bottom jaw, and their bodies seemed to have weathered significantly, making them look emaciated. The weather-damaged plaque and the stripping paint on the gate didn’t help with my uneasiness. The stone steps past the torii ascend into a darkness I can only describe as void, vignetted by dark green foliage.

I only then noticed how lethally silent it was now in the forest, and how much darker the sky was. I’m panicking, praying I wouldn’t become digested in the stomach of the forest. I found myself asking, “will it hurt?”

A loud sound, like a mix of thunder and heavy rocks falling, echoes and my stomach drops. I think it’s a landslide, though I have never seen one outside of a TV screen. Words flashed in my mind’s eye.

*College Student Goes Missing on Mountain: Landslide Erupts Where Last Seen*

Time slowed. I was a living, breathing stop-motion picture. In each frame, my blood pulsed and I felt every bit of it, running through me so freely in my veins. A smog on my shoulders made them so light and relaxed I didn’t even know if my limbs were still attached to my torso. Then, as though I had summoned it with a single shaky breath, it crawled down from the nothingness ahead.

Fear stuck to me, like the stubborn yolk of a runny egg that was cut with a plastic knife, left stained in a kitchen sink for days. Something wriggled in the dark tunnel up ahead of me, climbing down the stairs. The first thing I saw was a fleshy slop, like dead embryos, inflated with air and blood with a slight coat of wet over it. It slipped down the stairs and I saw more of it, and it was all just the same fleshy amalgamation with a visible nervous system pulsing just underneath whatever meaty flesh it had. Multiple parts of it would bubble up and deflate, breathing with several lungs. Blister-like nodules covered the body, pregnant with pus. It was taller than it was wide, almost as tall as the torii gate it was passing through.

Each step it took it sounded like a crude chorus of something between smacking lips and crushing a bucket of slugs with a bare hand. From whatever orifice I couldn’t see, blood would slowly drip out and cover the thing. I couldn’t move. I didn’t see it travel the distance it needed to be close enough for it to touch me. Intuitively, I somehow understood that it ate away at time. Or was it space? It came inside my head, intrusively. It felt like the grooves of my brain were being gently caressed by its slimy flesh while it whispered to me a spell to obscure my perception.

It reached out with little tendrils at first, but then those tendrils thickened into appendages, and then it simply clung onto me and spread around my silhouette. I felt it exploring every pore on my skin. It smelled like expiring meat aspic mixed with dirt and blood and cum and drain water. The red sheen with strange tendons had a light purplish hue, and blood clots were trapped underneath thin films of silvery membrane.

It engulfed me. The wet-slug-and-lips smacking sound got louder until it filled up my entire ear and I couldn’t hear anything but the gurgle of something pulsing. The meaty thing plugged up my ear like a large tongue. It moved around me like a large snail eating me whole. I didn’t dare open my mouth because I knew that the moment I screamed, it would find a way down my gullet.

Then it retreated, suddenly, back to the dark green hole it descended from.

I ran faster than I knew I could down the stone path, clawing up the steep hill without care of the tears, snot and saliva that dribbled down my face. I cried so hard I couldn’t breathe from my nostrils with all the gooey snot, and panted like prey who saw a chance to live. By the time I had reached the path at the top, I was racing against the sunset with a cloudless sky, the first I’d seen in days. In my blurred vision the brilliant red light seemed to burn the tops of trees in a brilliant fire, and the clouds seemed to glow like glass in a lehr. I fell over my own feet again and again as I raced to get out of the mountains, nearly tumbling and rolling down the hill. Nearing the foot of the hill, I heard that loud land-slide rumble again, farther away this time. The air was shivering as though a banshee had shrieked.

Once I reached the aqueduct, I gathered myself the best I could. My phone’s battery was dead, and so I rolled up my sleeves to check my watch. It was then I realized I lost track of over five hours in the mountain. I suddenly felt like I was being steamed alive and the boiling bubbles of hell were not far below my feet, and I sweat profusely and unreasonably for a cold winters’ night.

I can’t remember all the things that happened on my way back to Yuri’s. Rounding a corner onto a street I made my way back down before encountering two meaty blobs, smaller and human-sized compared to the one at the shrine, inching their way towards me. I froze. Over the sound of the smacking lips I hear shrill voices speak like they’re gurgling their way through a slit throat.

“That guy you like is at the drinking party next week, you have to come!”

“But Mina is going to be there too, she’s such an airhead around guys.”

I walked slowly that evening, making sure I didn’t fall over my pliant knees. Not a single human was left in my sight. Every living person had become a melted fleshy mass, and I couldn’t help but check my hands, turning them over and over again to make sure I wasn’t that thing everyone else turned into. I felt defiled as I passed every blood-gurgling flesh-thing in the city. They were unsightly and pungent like old sanitary pads. They crawled and dragged themselves without any hesitation, like they belonged here. And it made me sick.

Yuri opened the door and spurted blood, and what I think is spit, from the folds of meat lumps as she asked me where I’d been.

“I’ve just wrapped up your dinner because you were out so late,” the form gurgles. Flecks of puce landed on my face. “You didn’t answer my texts.”

“I’m sorry Yuri, I got really hungry and ate already.” My words trigger a hair in a venus-flytrap mouth, lacing my throat tight. Through it, I manage to squeak “I drank a bit too, so I’ll just bathe.”

Covering myself in soap suds, I stared at myself in the mirror of the small Japanese bathroom, sitting on the plastic stool. I wiped away the steam every few seconds to keep staring. My fingertips were pruning and the scalding hot water on my back tried to wash away the nightmare. The smell of lavender fills up every inch of me, and the soap bar shrinks in my hand quickly. I tried to wash away the sensation I felt at the shrine, but the phantom touch of the flesh creature reached out to envelop me again. Again and again, sinking into my skin, leaving imprints. My nude reflection in the mirror began to distort.

At one point, I remember throwing the soap on the floor, and curling up into a ball on the tiled floor, the shower still raining down on me. I jerk around, squirming like a drowning roach. Then I hear the smacking-lip sound outside of the bathroom’s obscure glass door, and see a distorted red blob beyond it.

“Is everything alright?” Yuri asks, and a single eyeball is pressed up against the frosted glass door. Any more pressure on the eye could make it burst. I say that I’m okay and try not to cry.

The call I made to my father was brief. His breaths seemed labored through the squelching sounds of his, assumedly, wet and fleshy form as he quietly asked why I called later than usual. I couldn’t come up with an excuse and fell silent.

“I’ll pick you up at the station tomorrow morning. We can talk more once you come back.”

I could tell you about how I stood on the veranda all morning the next day imagining the fall. Or how I once read that you could crush someone’s eyeballs with the same pressure as breaking the skin of an orange and wondering if I could mutilate myself, while trapped in the airplane with those things as I flew back home to New York. But it would feel like torture, so forgive me for not mentioning any more.

I had decided that I wouldn’t speak of this waking nightmare to anyone, because I didn’t want to think about what would happen if I did. I refused to spend my days there again in the psychiatric ward, tranquilized by antidepressants. I was sedated in those windowless walls and I once even wet myself in my sleep. The old, stringbean nurse scrunched her face as she balled up my linens and disinfected my mattress, before forcing me to forget my embarrassment with more drugs. In the weeks following that incident, that nurse would dig her heels into the linoleum floors so hard that her violet rubber clogs would squelch every time I passed by her. 

But that didn’t stop my father from noticing I was acting strangely. I didn’t eat out for the rest of my time in Japan, and confined myself to the hotel room feigning sickness and only eating wrapped convenience store foods. I lost so much weight. Eventually my father sent me to get checked by a psychiatrist (even though he’s repeatedly proclaimed all shrinks were frauds) before Winter Break ended, and I got diagnosed for mysophobia and scopophobia; extreme fear of germs and of being watched. They increased my medication and booked me an appointment with a shitty therapist that specializes in my new diagnosis the week after. While I holed up in my room for the rest of Winter Break, I remember hearing neighbors come by and praise my father for his resilience and send him their condolences.

My father was someone who the town looked up to. He got his American citizenship just after I was born, and was often praised for his indulgent nature which contrasted the straight-laced stereotypes of a Japanese salaryman. His accent was like a slightly audible lisp, and his well-curated single-father persona was endearing, so much so that the white moms in PTA would fawn over him. The police always said he was a good man, always had time to chat at the coffee shop, remember their kids’ accomplishments, praise the parents without bringing attention to it.

But at home, his love was conditional and his animosity would roll like a cold font. He did not know how to smile with his eyes. He did not bicker, no, because that is immature–he corrected. He did not need many words to keep me obedient. “Control yourself,” was his mantra and my dogma. So when I, without addressing it directly, suggested I take a year off from college, he placed his soaked appendage on my knee and rubbed it. I imagined taking my kneecap and driving it into his supple side. With exaggerated calm he said:

“Think about this carefully, sweetie. You’d get in a lot of trouble if you fall behind. Remember high school, when you went to the hospital? I wouldn’t want you to go through all the hurt again.”

I didn’t want his composure to bleed out too long, or else there would be consequences. So I packed up my things and let myself be driven back to campus just before January ended.

Spring semester starts up and my descent into becoming a social outcast was not gradual. I remember overhearing my roommates talk about my strange habits. “She hogs up the bathroom for showers and spends forever in there. And half of the time the water’s not even on.” “I think the RAs said something about her being sort of a germaphobe.”

It was all true though, and I spent a copious amount of time cleaning myself. I also had become obsessed with my own flesh, and poked at the naked body while standing in front of the mirror. First, I’d wrap my fingers around the plinth of flesh on my neck where an Adam’s apple would roost if I had one, and then trail down to my collarbones and drag my nails down my sternum til my skin was flush with four stripes. I skipped over my stomach flab because my x-rays eyes could see all the guts inside, and my grumbling stomach sounded too similar to those flesh heaps. Then I put my hands on my hips, thumbs facing forward and rubbed over my hip bones that protruded like little boulder climbing holds. They didn’t have bones like I did. I relished it.

Drinking helped take the edge off, and cleansed my insides before and after throwing up. My habit of getting drunk made my room consistently smell like vomit and coffee creamer. I also liked coffee. The smell of the cheap grounds cleared my sinus of the things’ smell. I ate sugar packets and dry cereal and pickles and go-gurt and slices of deli ham and cheese. I didn’t get up from my bed on weekends, and cursed the sun, and lit matches till my fingertips burned off so I could smell like smoke.

I slipped into dreams and books. I did not become fragile, I became detached. I gathered distance like I could weld it into armor. The Flesh was everywhere, and I would tell myself this is not a new reality, but something that had always been there. That I was the one that changed, not the world.

Mid-April, I’m standing outside a DIY concert at someone’s house right before finals week was in full force, crushing my empty pack of Marlboro’s. They called the place “The Dome,” and you can tell it was probably called that because of the large Mad Max poster that was hung in the vestibule of the rickety house. The living room, when it wasn’t occupied by bands and college students, only had some fold-up chairs, a folding table, and large speakers which flanked the make-shift stage, which was really just duct tape formed into a rectangle on the floor.

Being in that small living room with those things made me feel like I’d swallowed liquid iron, and my insides started to rust. Thankfully the bands were subpar at best and a crowd barely formed, but I still deeply regretted letting myself be dragged out by the few ‘people’ I had left to call friends to stave off the weirdo-allegations, though I knew it wouldn’t be all too successful.

Mariya made it all melt away as she stood there at the curb under the streetlight.

She broke the reality I knew for the past four months, and I felt like I could finally breathe. Mariya, Perfect Mariya. I have no idea how to bring up to her the fact that her voice is like an oasis in the desert, and that her existence is angelic. I take in every inch of her and burn it into my retina, trying to make sense of it all. Mariya, Mariya, Mariya. She was all I could see.

She had a heavy liner and close-set hooded eyes. Big, soft hair was cut short and she looked a bit anemic. Muddy blue eyes, a crooked nose. Bitten nails like snapped popsicle sticks and bruises that accentuated her knobby knees. If you asked her about the cuts and bruises she’d say “you should see the other guy.” But you’d know from her toothy grin and round saucer eyes like a squirrel that there’s no “other guy.” She had the echo of a Russian accent on her tongue, which I could never forget.

Mariya extended her pack of Parliaments my way as a greeting.

“Bum a smoke?”

“Yeah,” I croaked instinctively, sheepish at the sound of my dried up voice. “Thanks.”

She lights my cigarette for me and I pull away from her, looking behind me at some flesh lumps talking on the front porch. I whip my head back at Mariya, Perfect Mariya, who introduces herself. I have no idea how to bring up to her the fact that her voice is like an oasis in the desert. I take in every inch of her and burn it into my retina. We did our mundane by-the-book introductions “what’s your major?” and “what year are you?”, “who do you know?” Then she invites me to her car

“Join me for a drive.”

“What?”

I was caught off guard and she laughed, a sudden change from her commanding tone she used only moments before. Her voice was clear in the milky air.

“You see me and I see you. We both can’t see anyone else. Come on, let’s go.”

I climb in without another word. Mariya starts the car and rolls both our windows down, and the magnolias nod their velvet petals at something in the wind. She tells me about her own encounter with that thing in the woods, back in her father’s hometown in Russia last year when she was visiting family. She thought it was the Faerie King at first, because he’s said to lure humans away and make them lose time in the forest. Her mother warned her about the woods in her backyard since she was a child and didn’t take it seriously until she encountered the thing.

“I thought I’d be taken away by some malevolent god of the forest or something,” I interjected manically. “Kami-kakushi.”

I ash my cigarette out of the car. This whole time, I thought what I experienced was to be interpreted as something that could only make sense because I was trespassing on an abandoned Shinto shrine. Yet, when Mariya kept talking about her theories, it was clear that this was a monster untethered by any land, religion, or otherwise. Kokkuri-san for me is just a ouija board for someone else, just as my Hanako is just someone’s Bloody Mary.

Mariya hums, eyes still on the road. Her expression was blank, but the rosary that hung on her rearview mirror swayed gently like a pendulum which seemed to speak on her behalf, swaying between relief and anxiety. We pass a few more streetlights, turn a couple more streets, until we’re back on the street of the house party. She parks the car and lays her forehead on the steering wheel. I ask her my questions.

“Have you met others like us?”

“No. I haven’t.”

“And you’ve had this for…?”

“…Eight months.”

“God. That’s, I'm so sorry, that's awful,” I swallow the fog. “It’s a crazy coincidence we met.”

She jerks her head up nervously, eyes wide open.

“There are no coincidences. Only choices.”

Got my gastric sleeve at age of 23 on April 20th 2024 at 130.8 kgs 
Today I weight 67 kgs which is BMI 24.6 ( started BMI 48) 
My goal weight is 55 kgs so still 12 kgs away but will get there 🫡💗
So basically have lost almost half of my body weight in just over a year. 
For anyone who is lurking on this thread wondering if they should do this surgery: DO IT. I say as it as a patient AND a medical doctor (I’m from UK and graduated med school at 23 and got surgery right before starting work) 
My only regret is not doing it at the age of 19 when I first considered it. My life is changed. Physically and mentally. 
Physically: I am a lot more active, my resting HR went from 110 to 60, I actually kind of enjoy working out which I loathed before, I’m a better doctor to my patients, I can run for emergencies. I just look and feel better in myself. 
Mentally: I’m a different person. I’ve proven to myself I’ve shown up for myself day after day even when it wasn’t easy. That give you faith in yourself. Yes the surgery was a tool, yes the surgery helped me but I had to put in the work and I’m so proud I did. 

And for anyone who wants to know my eating style a year out/ working out habits: I have a protein coffee in the morning post work out and then do one meal a day. I’m vegetarian so try to incorporate tofu etc to help with protein although still struggle with reaching my protein goals and that’s something I need to work on. 

Workout wise: I do 30 mins cardio 5 days a week with 3 days of strength training and one day of reformer Pilates (losing 63+ kgs you don’t realise how much core strength you lose, it’s humbling but so necessary)

1las0n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1las0n5/desperately_trying_to_understand_the_world_at_21/,Desperately trying to understand the world at 21,"All my life I've had many dreams. The earliest dream I can remember was wanting to be a mommy. I liked playing house with dolls when I was really young, and then with Barbies as I got older. My sister and I fought when playing, especially over who got to play the mom and who got to play the baby. My dad rarely joined, but he sometimes would play Ken with us, and not Barbie because ""her feet were unnaturally pointed.""

I remember my second dream started in around the 5th grade, and that was to be a math teacher. I think I was a bit egotistical back then, because I never had a passion for teaching, I just wanted to seem smart to other people. That dream quickly turned into wanting to be a famous youtuber, actor, or singer; I was obsessed with fame (again, ego). Reflecting back I think it was age appropriate ego. Everyone craves attention at that age to some extent.

Since I wanted to be an actor I immersed myself in all types of art. Musical theatre, choir, band, and dancing. Forced my dad to drive me to auditions 3 hours away. Got my mom to cart me from school to theatre programs. I never really had days off. And no, I never succeeded in anything big. My auditions were usually awkward and badly preformed. The only ""roles"" I landed were at my local kids studios or in my school.

I did get better at singing and acting, but only around when I was 15, and by then my fight for this whole ""fame"" dream had died down mostly. I progressed in singing at this age because I had a new voice teacher who changed my perspective on a lot of things. She taught the technicals of singing, which was brand new to me. Most choir directors in the past had just told you to ""feel the music"" or ""use your diaphragm,"" but had neglected to articulate what that actually meant. How was I supposed to know you actually have to flex your muscles when you sing? She really helped me understand my body, my muscles, and showed me that while singing is an art, you must learn the science behind it as well.

My life changed on March 14th, 2020. Those who like math will recognize this as the incredibly important, nationally recognized holiday, Pi Day, ""3/14."" Now most may not celebrate this day, but at my school, Pi day was a BIG deal. This year, you got to pay $5 to throw a pie in any teachers face, or any participating graduates face, in front of the whole school. I was going to pie my graduating sister in the face and it was going to be awesome. The best $5 I would ever spend.

But that never happened. On Friday, March 14th, 2020, The principal sounded on the loud speaker to tell us the event had been cancelled due to restrictions on large crowds. Everyone laughed and joked about ""corona"" coming to kill us all. We were disappointed about the cancelled pies, but were all excited for spring break, which was the next 2 weeks. But spring break turned to 4 weeks, to school being cancelled indefinitely, to zoom school.

My thoughts changed slowly during this time. I sat more, just thinking. My life slowed. Zoom school was much less demanding. I slept more. Despite the world altering, with death and illness all around us, I felt more peace and calm in my life then I ever had before.

In around April I decided to learn how to paint and draw. I would wake up early every day and spend hours at my desk experimenting with techniques, following tutorials, and practicing the skills. I got pretty good fairly fast. I know art is subjective, so by ""good"" I mean I could see something and realistically draw it. And I kept going with it. I got more realistic, advanced my mediums, started oil painting and portraits.

I fell in love with progression. I had so much time to practice so it all happened in a couple months. I could remember when I struggled to master an eyeball, and now I was painting full realistic portraits in a couple hours. It was fun. It was fulfilling. It felt like what I wanted to do. I reflected on my old dreams, the ones filled with fame and attention, and saw how silly that was. I began to prefer a quieter passion.

While I was finding peace in painting, there were a lot of things going on in the world that disturbed me. I was young, naive, and white, so I had never thought much about how racism was a thing that was happening here and now. It felt like something more in the past, or in lands further from me. The BLM protests pulled me out of the world I was living in and put me in a new one. I couldn't understand why there was so much hate in the world. I didn't know how to help, or contribute, or what to change, how to act, how to stand up, where to protest, who to protest to. Who are we fighting? Is there evil in this world or just people who are uneducated, misguided, hurt, and manipulated?

As I grew up, graduated, and moved away to university, I saw many types of injustices all over the world. Most of it felt confusing to me. I'd research into history and wars and conflicts and walk out with less of a grasp on why things were the way they are. I spent a long time trying to fully grasp the Israel and Palestine conflict, trying to figure out who really has a ""right"" to the land, but I've given up, because I know I will never truly understand it. I don't know the concept of owning dirt, owning the earth, of feeling the cultural and religious significance of a place, and I will never in a million lives across the galaxies imagine murdering an entire population, a culture, murdering human beings, because you disagree with them being on your dirt. I know people try to complicate war and murder, try to justify or humanize terrorizing, and I understand this conflict is far from simple and the solutions are not easy. I know conflict is not one sided. But war is a child's answer. It's a disgusting and disgraceful answer. It is unhuman, yet maybe in a sick, twisted way it is one of the most human things. All over the world we see genocide, injustices, and failures to protect humanity. We repeat the same conflicts wrapped in differently coloured blood stained boxes.

I feel inflicted with care. The only way I can move through life is to push it down and try to forget what I've read and what I've saw. Forget that I don't believe in this system. Replace the longing for community with screen time. I don't paint much anymore. I work 3 jobs and it leaves me little time to sit and think. And when I do, on occasion, sit down and think, research, read the news, I become so depressed that I call out of work the next day because I find it so hard to move. Sometimes I scroll, which is the worst thing to do. ""Here's how to make the best chocolate chip cookies-Gaza is dying, we need your help-here's why I got a boob job, and yes, I still love my body-revealing my art day 241 until it sells-use this new AI tool to finish your essays- ICE crack downs currently underway in America- Dance Moms facts you need to know-Woman laughs after killing 2 kids in dui crash, body cam footage-proof a tan can really change you...""

I look to music to help me understand how I feel. A song by Jesse Welles articulates how I feel. A verse from ""War Isn't Murder""-

""Let's talk about dead people

I mean a-dead people

War isn't murder, it's the vengeance of God

If you can't see the bodies, they don't bloat when they rot

And the flies don't swarm, and the children don't cry

If war isn't murder, good men don't die

So in a short 20 years, when you vacation the Strip

Don't think about the dead and have a nice trip""

At age 21, I don't really know how to live my life. I'm not convinced most people really figure that out. We're all just going through the motions and hoping we'll be happy one day.

I haven't thought much about dreams lately. I don't feel I have time for dreams. I work full time at a coffee shop chain, and also have 2 other jobs I do on the side. I guess the work isn't so bad, but it's non stop and drains me of my physical and mental energy very fast. I don't think I'm so good at customer service, and it makes me dislike people very fast, which is unfortunate. I wish I could pretend to care about customers more, but I really do not. I serve too many in a day, our interactions are transactional and timed, so no, I can't really care about how your day is going, it is just policy that I ask. No I do not care that you enjoy your $8 latte, it is just policy to write that on your cup.

I view this work very negatively and in some ways am my own enemy. It just feels against everything in my body to stand behind a counter and represent a company that is currently union busting and being sued for slave like conditions in South America. If I had more time in a day what I could do with it. If I wasn't tied to 3 jobs working 40+ hours a week? Would I feel more human? Could I foster more community? Would I have time to help the people around me, participate in protests, seek to change the system I hate? Would I have more time to dream? What are my dreams now?

If I really think hard, I have a yearning for the same dream I first had, to be a mom. A lot humbler than my fame dream era. I try not to think about it a lot, because it feels impossible to do now. The world is too expensive for a family. I live with a roommate sharing a 1 room basement suite, I have the cheapest phone and only thrift clothes if I need them. I don't eat out much and buy most of my groceries on sale at Walmart. I don't buy anything expensive and make do with what I already have. Money is the biggest struggle in my life. It's mostly what I think about. How can I work 3 jobs, spend as little as possible, and barley afford to live? How can I possibly fathom having a child like that?

I think humans are extremely vulnerable to manipulation and abuse because of our natural ability to dream. Work a 9-5 and get paid minimum wage in a company that has billions of profit? One day you could be CEO if you work hard enough! Working 60 hours a week and barley see your young kids? It'll be worth it one day so you can send your kids to University and they can get a better job that you!

Maybe people will think I'm young and lazy, but I hope you understand this. I moved away to a new city when I was 18 to attend full time university for a year. I ran out of money and have been working full time ever since to afford 1 class a semester. I now also work 2 other jobs just to afford my needs. I pay my own rent, groceries, phone bill, gas, everything alone.

And I would work a job happily, keep my nose down and work hard, wouldn't complain or get depressed, if there was still time for me to feel human. If I could have enough time away from work, or a livable wage, I could leave space for enjoying nature. Writing music, creating art, supporting local businesses, traveling and meeting new people. I would love enough time to build lasting friendships and help others. The old promise of raising a family off one wage, getting a house and a car, with a good retirement, that's all gone. So what exactly am I trading with this corporation? My time, body, and energy, to barley make ends meet and scramble to survive? To grow the profits of a company who share none of the values I have? I have lost faith in the system. I don't feel naive enough to dream of having a child. And maybe that is nihilistic of me but so be it. Yes there are people that move up in life, people who make more money than their parents, small startups that succeed, but the statistics are against us all. Even if I rise above poverty, what about the ones who do not?  I wish we didn't have to be individualistic and greedy. We are all concerned with our own finances and stability it is hard to lend a hand.

Maybe in another life I could have been a painter, or maybe a photographer. The lesson my singing teacher taught me years ago that seemed so important at the time is less so now. I don't have much time for progression or technical work in art, or music, or anything really. I work, I get home, I do more work, I pack my lunch for tomorrow, sleep, do it all again the next day, again the next week, and again forever, I guess.

Now, I must make the ultimate sacrifice to return home.","To whoever may be reading this, these are my last words. At 9AM tomorrow, I will be ending my life. This is not where I belong. I can only hope that by doing this, I will return home.

The summer before my sophomore year of high school, I was sick nearly every day. I would have a sore throat for a few weeks, feel better for a day or two, and then wake up sick again. My mom took me to an ENT after about two months of non-stop sickness. The doctor, Dr. Thoth, who had a heavy eastern European accent, stuck a popsicle stick in my mouth and examined it. I still remember the taste of those wooden sticks, like the ones in those ice cream cups they would serve at class parties. It’s one of the last memories of home I have.

""Well, Edward, your tonsils are quite beat up,"" he chuckled, ""I would recommend a tonsillectomy."" This was strange for me, since my mom had assured me that doctors stopped performing tonsillectomies in the 80s.

""I'll have Rita at the front desk schedule a follow up. Do you need a note for school?"" he asked, taking off his gloves. He looked at me with wide eyes, which looked somewhat uncanny due to his furrowed brow.

""No,"" I replied, ""school starts next week."" He nodded, glancing to the side, his light demeanor shifting to dark, and led us to the front desk.

The lobby was dingy with baby blue wallpaper that must have been placed at least 100 years ago. Above a chair in the waiting room, there was a cross and a picture of the Pope. The woman at the front desk was large and had eye bags like she hadn't slept in days. She was chewing gum, and her jaw shifted slightly to the right left with every loud gnaw. My mother and I sat there for about a minute, not knowing whether she was aware of us or not.

""Excuse me?” she finally asked. The woman slowly turned her head slowly while still loudly chewing her gum.

“How can I help you?” She asked in an annoyed manner, and her eyes with heavy, fake eyelashes twitched.

“Hello, I need to schedule a follow up for my son,” my mom replied, trying to keep her calm.

“Will that be with Dr. Thoth?” she asked.

“Yep,” my mother responded. The woman’s eyes widened.

“I’ve always liked Dr. Thoth,” the front desk woman said, “He has his way of making things work.” She smiled- or rather grinned- softly.

My mom, clearly uncomfortable by her strange comment and demeanor said, “Yeah… right, when is his next availability?” The woman spit out her gum into a bag, filled with chewed up wads of white gum. 

“Mm, April 16th, 9:00?” she asked, politely. My mother pulled out her phone to check her calendar.

“April… April… that’s like nearly a year from now, right?” my mother asked. The woman nodded.

“That’s the soonest we have, I’ll let you know if something opens up,” the woman said.

“9:00 is fine,” my mother sighed.

After typing for a few seconds, the woman said, “Alright, that’s all. Have a nice day.” 

We walked to our car, and I could hear the earth crunching under her pounding feet. The mother I knew was hot-headed. She was the shortest-tempered woman I ever knew. 

""A tonsillectomy, huh?"" my mom said, in a slightly annoyed tone, ""You know, Eddie, surgeons love doing surgery. You probably don't even need it. But hey, no school for a week. And milkshakes"" She looked over and smiled, her agitated demeanor softening.

""Yeah,"" I replied. Her smile dropped as she read my uninterested tone, and she sighed just loud enough for me to hear. The rest of the car ride was silent. 

The Monday after that was the first day of my sophomore year. I woke up about 7AM, and performed the usual routine: shower, brush my teeth, get dressed, and leave. I never ate breakfast, the Ambien (a sleeping pill) I was on made me nauseous. I went into my mom’s room to let her know, and she looked at me, surprised.

“Honey, why are you wearing such big jeans? It’s gonna be 100 degrees today,” she said, concerned. Annoyed, I sighed and slightly rolled my eyes in classic teenager fashion. We got into the car, and started driving to the high school.

“So, Eddie, you excited for your first day?” she asked, starting the car.

“Not especially,” I answered. She nodded her head and had that annoyed expression on her face. I then heard a large tire screech break the deadly silence between my mother and I. A car, trying to escape the police, bolted down the street in the lane next to us, running multiple red lights and nearly causing an accident.

“Jesus Christ!” my mother yelled while exhaling and holding her chest. The car must have been going at least 100 miles per hour. Shortly after he drove past us, he crashed into the brick wall guarding the school. The car was crushed, and the man died on impact instantly.

“What a great omen for your first day, huh Eddie?” She looked at me with her twitching, ‘crazy eyes’ look. I stared at the smashed car with a blank face, until I got out of the car.

We said goodbye, and I walked onto my massive campus of nearly 3000 kids. The same kids I’ve known since kindergarten, but so different.

 I eventually got to my homeroom, english, and sat down in the back of the class, like I always have. I glanced to my right and saw a girl with long,  sandy blonde hair that had purple tips. Her eyes were blue, like the Pacific Ocean, and her eyelashes were long and black. She had strangely round cheeks that did not match the rest of her extremely thin frame; but she was beautiful I stared at her with wide eyes until she looked my way, and I snapped my head back to the board. I completed the class, and then the classes after that, until lunch started. I didn’t get lunch. I just sat by myself in the cafeteria with my headphones in.

I felt a tap on my shoulder, and my entire body jolted as I turned around. It was that girl, and my face felt hot as I looked up at her.

“Hey, Edward, right?” she asked.

“Uh, yeah, that’s me,” I replied, nervously. She smiled at me.

“I just wanted to say that I like your shirt,” she said. I was wearing a shirt that said ‘Pareidolia,’ a somewhat popular alternative band that doesn’t exist where I am now. I loved this band, (hence the username) and had a lot of merchandise from concerts and shows, alongside a fair amount of bootlegs.

“My shirt? Oh, yeah, my shirt, thank you,” I said, not being able to think straight. 

“You’re welcome,” she beamed, “Hey, how about you sit with me and my friends?” I could feel the color draining from my face as I started scrambling for an answer.

“Uh, I have to get some work done, but thanks,” I idiotically replied, my nervous smile fading as I realized there was no homework in any class.

She looked at me with a suspicious, yet playful, manner and said, “Alright, but to make up for it, you have to come to my thing on Saturday?”

“What thing-” I could barely get out the words before I felt her finger on my mouth, shushing me, with an ear-to-ear grin. 

“Don’t worry about it. I’ll text you the details,” she laughed, “here, type in your number.” I shakily took her phone and carefully typed in my number.

“I’m Lydia, by the way,” she said while I gave her phone back to her. Before I could come up with a response, she had already walked away. 

Her smile was contagious. I had a stupid, red grin on my face and my eyebrows were raised softly as I watched her leave.

Later that day, after a very long first day of syllabus after syllabus being thrown at my face, I finally laid in bed. I closed my eyes, and fell into a deep sleep.

You know that feeling when you wake up from a nap, and you’re sweaty, your room is dark, you are insatiably thirsty, and you have no idea what time it is? That is how I woke up. I don’t remember any of the dreams I might have had, but I remember waking up terrified. I stood up to turn on my light, and then went to check my phone. 7:52pm.

*Jesus Christ*. I thought to myself. I rubbed my eyes, and as they adjusted to the light, I saw some texts from an unknown number.

The texts are gone now, but it went something like this:

Lydia (L): Hi

Me (E): hey

*L: Took you long enough*

*E: Sorry*

*L: I’m just messing with you*

*E: Oh my bad*

*L: So that thing on Saturday, wanna come? 3pm It’s like a party but not really. Parents are gone*

*E: Who would be there*

*L: Just a few of my friends and you of course*

*E: What are you guys gonna do*

*L: You’ll see*

*E: Uh okay, what’s the address*

*L: 266 McLinen Ave, will you be there?*

*E: yeah*

*L: okay, see you at school :)*



I put my phone on my bedside table, and laid in my bed, staring at the ceiling. I thought about her, for what must have been 20 minutes. I thought about what she’d look like in a white dress. I thought about what our kids would look like. I always had a habit of jumping to the extremes, with people I liked, hyperfocusing on one person at a time. My hyperfixation was her.

I floated by the next week of school, only dealing with the extreme boredom by looking at her if she was near. If she wasn’t, I would think about her. Finally, the day of the party (or whatever she was calling it) was here. I woke up at 5am, I couldn’t sleep due to pure juvenile excitement. I got dressed in my biggest jeans and one of my pareidolia shirts, layered with a long sleeve underneath- despite it being 100 degrees- with black boots I would wear on every occasion. I rotted in bed until about 2:30.

“Mom, I’m going to a friend’s house,” I said.

“Okay, do you need a ride, Eddie?” she replied.

“No, I’ll just walk,” I said, foolishly. I was unaware that it was about an hour long walk. I went outside, in the blazing hot sun, and began heading north. I was repeating the address in my head over and over again. After about 20 minutes, I realized I was not getting any closer, and I was going to be late. As if God himself heard my groans in the hot sun, a cab appeared. This was very strange, in my 15 years of life at that point I had never seen a cab in my town. I shrugged, and stopped it. Luckily, I had 20 dollars with me.

“266 Mclinen avenue,” I mumbled as I got into the front seat. He was silent. It was a tall, thin man, deep, dark eye bags. Just like a cliche, he had a scarf over his mouth and a hat on. He grunted. In situations like these, my mother always taught me to make conversation so as to not make things awkward.

“So, do you like this job?” I asked. He shrugged in response. “You get to go sight-seeing, though, right?” 

“Not much to see around these parts,” he mumbled, so quietly I could barely hear him. I heard a faint eastern-European accent, just like my ENT. 

“Dr. Thoth?” I asked. And just like that, even though I had only been in the car for about 5 minutes, we were there.

“Here’s your stop. Goodbye,” he almost demanded. I nodded cautiously and got out. It was a suburban house with a run-down yard, definitely has not been mowed in months- if not years. I knocked on the door, no answer. “Hey, over here!” an unfamiliar voice called from the window on the side of the house. I jumped, startled. I walked over there, the dry, dead grass crunching under my boots.

“Can you let me in?” I asked. 

“Come in through the window!” one of the inebriated girls exclaimed. I walked up to the window, and tried to push myself in. While the girls laughed at me, I squeezed in through the small window, and stumbled as I fell inside the room. I looked around and saw a perfectly pink little girls bedroom: Polaroid pictures all over, fairy lights, and innocent, cutsey decor scattered about. I sat in silence, as I listened to the girls talk. Two of the girls were chattering on about their sugar daddies, and another pair was laughing and fidgeting with stuff in their laps. Lydia sat next to me, rather close, I might add, and greeted me. 

“This is Edward, guys,” she said. They all waved, and one of the girls replied, “We’ve heard a lot about you,” and laughed, which made me blush.

“Sorry if that was rude, they have strange ways of having fun sometimes,” she said to me.

“It’s all good,” I responded, embarrassed. I didn’t want to show it, though. We talked for a few minutes, mainly about music, until I heard one of the girls’ shrill voices.

“It’s done,” the girl said. I think her name was Ash- which was rather ironic because of what she was talking about.

“You ever tried one of these before, Edward?” My heart dropped as soon as I saw what she was holding. It was a blunt. I went pale and started sweating, but I tried to hide it as I saw them all staring at me like vultures.

“Oh, yeah, plenty of times,” I said, and I’m sure the lie was obvious, but no one questioned.

“Here, I’ll let you go first,” Ash said. She handed it to me as my heart pounded. With a lump in my throat, I took the rolled up blunt. One of the girls handed me a lighter, and it slipped right out of my sweaty hand. A bright pink lighter, like it was meant for a small girl. I looked at the things in my hands, and saw my father’s disheveled face in the reflection of the shiny, pink lighter. Thin, eyes empty like black holes, lips chapped and teeth rotting. I lit the blunt, and felt a familiar scent, the skunk-like scent of my father coming home late at night to tuck me into bed. I took it up to my face, and took a shallow breath into the blunt. The terrible smell expanded in my mouth and into my lungs, and I felt the disappointment of my mother wash over me. Yet, it felt good, like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders and floated up into the sky.

“Are you just gonna hog it?” Another girl, Mari, said. I jumped and handed it to her. The blunt passed around in a circle a few times, every time I inhaled I felt better and the guilt melted off. At the third or fourth rotation, once it got back to Lydia, we were talking like we had known each other for ages. I had noticed that Lydia had gotten progressively closer to me over time, physically I mean. At this point, her hand was on mine, but I didn’t care. I wasn’t nervous. Lydia took a breath into the blunt, leaned over, and kissed me. She blew the smoke into my mouth and it filled my lungs, but I didn’t choke. Her friends giggled as they watched us kiss. 

Hours passed, but it felt like minutes. Before I knew it, it was 10pm, and I had three missed calls from my mom. My heart dropped to my feet, and I grabbed my stuff and practically ran out the door. I called my mom back and she started yelling at me.

“Where the hell are you? Why haven’t you answered my calls? Come home now,” she demanded. “I’ll call you an uber, what’s the address?” 

I told her the address and then hung up. I started panicking and nearly cried, until about 7 minutes later, I saw headlights. I got into the car and told him my home address, and he was silent. I arrived home 10 minutes later, and as I approached the door, I felt dread like I had never felt before. I begrudgingly opened the door and saw my mom in the living room.

“Come here,” she said, scaringly sullenly. I slowly walked over to her.

“I’m sorry mom, I lost track of time-” 

“I don’t want to hear it,” she interrupted me. “I could smell it from the doorway, Edward. I know what you did.” My heart sank, but I knew this was coming.

“Mom, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to-”

“Didn’t mean to? Seriously? Jesus Christ, I can’t even look at you, go to your room,” she yelled. As I walked up the stairs, on the verge of tears, I heard her say something. So faint, you could have missed it: “You are just like your father, a fucking disappointment.”

I felt hot with anger and sadness as I ran to my bedroom. I sat in my bed with tears streaming down my face. I shoved my face into my pillow and cried until I fell asleep.

The next morning when I woke up, my mother was gone. I was glad. I didn’t want to see her face. I walked into the living room and saw a picture on the coffee table, at a further glance, I saw my father’s face. His face before the drugs, when he was about my age. My parents met in high school, and had me somewhat young. I picked up the picture and brushed my fingers against his face, and I noticed a crack in the glass. It wasn’t there before, so I just assumed my mother dropped it- or more likely, tried to smash it. I felt a buzz in my pocket, and put the picture of my father down. It was Lydia, and suddenly the despair in my chest eased. The conversation went something like this:

L: *Are you okay? I didn’t want to bother you last night, you were in such a rush I didn’t know what to do*

E: *Yeah, I’m okay my mom just needed me home*

L: *Well, how about we see each other one on one today?*

I looked at the picture of my dad, then glanced back at my phone.

E: *Yeah, where should I meet you?*

She told me to meet her at her house. Similar to her friend Ash, Lydia was alone most often. Her aunt raised her after her mom got arrested for dealing, and her dad disappeared long before she was born. She didn’t live far, so I figured I’d walk again, which again was a huge mistake. About 10 minutes into my walk, once again, I was saved by that mysterious cab I would become so familiar with.

“426 Siri Avenue,” I told him. He grunted in response, and the rest of the ride was silent. I arrived at the house, a very small house in a poor neighborhood, and knocked on the door. She opened it with a smile on her face and let me in. We went into her room and she shut the door behind her.

“Edward, I have something but you have to swear you won’t tell the girls,” she said, seriously.

“Yeah, sure, what is it?” I replied, feeling slightly nervous.

“Last night, before I left, I found some H on Ash’s counter. I took it,” she blurted. My heart sank once again, but deeper into my stomach than last time. Heroin is what my dad overdosed on when I was nine. I was scared and I wanted to opt out, and then I remembered what my mother said to me the night before, and my worry crumbled.

“Let’s do it,” I exclaimed, feeling rebellious. She let me go first, since she was more experienced. She took out a purple ribbon from her hair and tied it around my bicep. She got the spoon and heated it with a lighter in her pocket, as she prepared the heroin. Every time I felt nervous, I just pictured my mom’s face. She hurt me, so I hurt her back.

“You ready?” she asked, holding the needle to my arm.

“Yeah. Yeah, I’m ready,” I replied. She stuck the needle into my vein and slowly pushed it in. As she took it out, I genuinely felt as if I was floating into the air, surrounded in a warm blanket of comfort and joy. She did the same to herself, and after that, I don’t really remember what happened. All I know is that I woke up with no pants, and the same went for her. It was night already when the heroin had faded, and we spared no time in lighting a blunt and smoking it together. We talked in her bed, me holding her with her head on my chest, and we fell asleep there. 

At around three in the morning, I got a call from my mother. I looked at the phone, then at the sleeping girl next to me, and then back at my phone. I silenced my phone, and fell back asleep with Lydia. 

This continued practically daily. My mother would ground me, take my phone, but I’d end up with Lydia despite her efforts. Within the next few months, I had tried nearly every substance known to man. I drank, I smoked weed, took pills, snorted coke and meth, and of course, heroin. I would come home to find empty bottles of wine on the kitchen table and my mom passed out on the couch. Except for one night. A Friday, I believe. 

“Edward,” my mother said, with dried tears on her face, “The ENT called. An opening came up, you have your tonsillectomy on Monday at 9:00. You have to be there.” 

I nodded and went upstairs to my room, where I could hear her crying. I loved my mother, but I needed her to hurt like how I hurt. The weekend flew by, and before I knew it, it was Sunday night. I was at Lydia’s, and at around midnight, my mother called me, reminding me of my procedure the next day. 

“I’ll be there,” I told her.

“Please come home, Edward, I love you,” she said to me. I hung up the phone. A few hours later, I gathered my stuff and called myself a ride home. I got into the car and the man started mumbling.

“Isn’t it a school night?” he muttered with a faint Russian accent.

“Yep,” I said bluntly, clearly annoyed.

“Don’t you think you should have already been home?” he said. This made me angry, and I wasn’t shy with my anger.

“Where the hell do you think you get off saying that? Mind your damn business. Jesus Christ,” I yelled. He was silent for the rest of the trip, and I slammed his car door on the way out. When I came home, my mother was already asleep. I went to my bed and stared at the ceiling. My body twitched and my heart pounded as I laid awake for hours upon hours, tweaking on what I assume was meth or crack. I didn’t need an alarm, since I was already awake by the time I needed to go. I showered, and when I saw myself in the mirror, I saw my father. Thin, frail, bruised body, and eyebags as dark as the growing gaps between my teeth. The water hurt my dry skin, and my thin hair piled by the drain as strands came out, one by one. My mother was on the couch, waiting for me, already drinking.

“You ready?” she asked me. I nodded. We got into the car and endured a silent, twenty minute ride to St. Catherine’s hospital, an old hospital downtown- actually, now that I think about it, my father was born there. 

When I walked inside of the hospital lobby, it was dark. There was brown wallpaper, Victorian style, with a portrait of the pope hanging above the reception desk. There were a few crosses scattered about the room in random places. The woman at the front desk called me over to sign some paperwork. She was thin and frail like me, and very Italian. I could barely understand her English. When I sat down, the chair was facing the wall, away from the woman, so she was just looking at the side of my head. It felt as though I was receiving a confession from a priest.

“Sign this,” she told me, coldly, “give me your right wrist.” I put down the pen and gave her my wrist, where she tied the hospital bracelet onto me. ‘Edward Sean Baxter, M, 12/31/07, Allergy: Tramadol,’ it said. I waited in the lobby silently with my mom, feeling as though Pope Francis was staring at me, judging me for my sins. 

“Edward Baxter?” a woman with a clipboard called. I sat up and went to her, and she took me to my pre op room. I wore a pale yellow hospital gown with those socks with grips on the bottom. The nurse took my arm and as she was about to tie the band onto me, she looked closer at the bruises by my vein.

“Got a vein punctured recently?” she asked, her dead, Russian eyes glaring directly into my soul. 

“Something like that,” I replied. My mom just sat in the corner, a shell of her former self. I texted Lydia after my blood was drawn. It was very early, about eight by this point, give or take. 

*‘I love you*’ I texted her. I had never said this to her before, but I knew how I felt about her. I loved her. My heart dropped as I could have sworn I saw a message bubble appear, and then suddenly, I heard someone knock on the door. It was Dr. Thoth.

“Alright, Edward, let’s go over the protocol,” he told me in his thick accent. He leaned over to look down my throat, and I saw his necklace dangling. It was an ankh, an Egyptian symbol of life. I had seen Lydia wear something like that previously. He took a look in my mouth and looked me in the eyes. I felt an intense fear and sense of dread as he stared into my eyes. His eyes were dark and dead, but exhibited this sense of pure anger. He looked at me for about 5 seconds, and then back into my mouth.

“You can close now,” he said, taking the stick out of my mouth, “don’t worry Edward, we will get you all fixed up.” He glared at me and let out a very subtle smirk.

“We’re going to take you to the OR now, okay?” the nurse said. They began to roll me on the bed to the surgical room. The halls were eerily empty, only a few doctors passing through alongside me. As they transferred me to the operating table, I thought about what Lydia’s response was going to be. It must have been obvious what I was thinking, because I was interrupted.

“Thinking about a girl?” Dr. Thoth asked me, staring at my soul with grinning eyes. 

“No- no, just thinking,” I replied, startled.

“It’s okay, Edward,” he said eerily, “she will still be here when you.” The fucker didn’t guess I was thinking about a girl. He *knew* I was thinking about her. 

They put a mask on my face and told me to countdown from 10. I didn’t, I just thought about her, and what we would do when I was out of here. As I faded out of consciousness, I saw my doctor standing over me, still grinning.

I woke up in a different room. Everything was hazy, and I was alone for a few seconds until the nurses came in. They immediately gave me some painkillers through my IV, and I told them I wanted my mother. I had not yet recollected my memory from the past few months, and all I wanted was my mother at that moment. 

“Sure, honey, I’ll go get her for you,” one of the nurses said to me. A minute later, my mom walked in. 

“Hey honey,” she said endearingly, “how are you feeling, Ed?” 

“Fine,” I replied, confused. I looked at her strangely; firstly, where had all of the animosity between us just a few hours before gone? Second, she never called me Ed.

“Well, we’ll start the discharge process, okay?” The nurse told my mother and I. She handed my mother a piece of paper on a clipboard with a pen. As she signed her name, the nurse took out my IV. Hey, my bruise from before was gone. My mom handed me the clipboard, and I was about to sign, but I noticed something. ‘Edward Shawn Baxter.’ 

“Hey mom, they made a typo on my name,” I said.

“Are you sure Ed? I didn’t see anything,” she replied, confused.

“Yeah, they spelt Sean ‘S-H-A-W-N,’” I told her.

“Honey, that’s how you spell Shawn. You’re probably just confused from the meds,” she assured.

“The meds can be disorienting for some,” the nurse said. I nodded and tried to take my mind off of it. As the medications wore off, I started to feel more and more pain in my throat, like the worst sore throat you’ll ever have. I couldn’t wait to get home so I could get into my stash of opiates to ease the pain. They prescribed me ibuprofen, since I’m allergic to tramadol- the usual opiate for small procedures; and god knows ibuprofen won’t do anything. 

“We’re home,” my mom said cheerfully. We got out of the car and went into the house, where my mom walked me to my room.

“Let me know if you need anything, Ed,” she said.

“Mom, why do you keep calling me ‘Ed,’” I asked her.

“What do you mean, hon? I’ve always called you Ed,” she replied.

“Right,” I muttered, and I shut the door. I practically ran to my dresser where my stash was hidden, and started rummaging through the drawers. Underwear, socks, and shirts were inside, but no drugs to be found. I started to call out for my mother, but then I realized it would just be better to drop it. Then, I remembered I had to text Lydia. I was hesitant and nervous to see what she had said, but I think on the inside I knew she loved me too. I picked up my phone and went to the message app. Our conversation wasn’t there. I scrolled up and down and even refreshed the page, but there was nothing. I tried calling her number, but it was out of service. Immediately, I thought about my mother. I knew she hated me and Lydia being together. She must have blocked her number on my phone. I wasn’t supposed to go back to school for a week, and I had no way to reach her. I got increasingly anxious as I realized how alone I was. Everything felt so strange and I didn’t know what to do; should I confront my mother about her behavior or should I leave it? Should I sneak off to Lydia’s house or wait until Monday? I decided it was for the best to just stay home and try to keep my mind off of it, at least for a while. So I laid in my bed, unable to swallow, and waited to fall asleep.

It was easier to fall asleep than usual, since I was on some sort of upper most of the time- usually meth. I dreamt about my father, at least I think. He was different from how I remember him; he wasn’t deathly thin, his eyes had life, and he didn’t have the bruises that I am now so familiar with on his arm. We played with a ball outside, in a park that looks so familiar, but I can’t put my finger on it. I felt joy for the first time in a while, pure, innocent joy- that nostalgic, bittersweet feeling you have when you remember your childhood memories. 

I woke up in pain. My throat was killing me. I stumbled down the stairs to the kitchen, where my mom was standing. 

“What time is it?” I asked with my hoarse voice.

“6pm,” she replied. I didn’t realize how long I had been sleeping.

I nodded. “I had a dream about dad,” I said hesitantly, knowing it’s a sore subject for my mother.

“Really?” she said cheerfully, smiling. This was extremely out of character. She’d usually just brush it off and change the subject. “What about?”

“Well, we were at a park, and throwing a ball back and forth,” I told her.

“Oh, those were such sweet times,” she said while approaching me, “do you remember how we’d have picnics at the park every Sunday?” She hugged me.

I thought about it for a second. “No, I don’t. I don’t ever remember spending time with dad,” I said.

“What are you talking about, Ed? We would go to the park every Sunday at noon,” she looked at me, extremely confused with a mix of concern. 

“How old was I? My only memories of dad is his coming home past midnight high out of his mind,” I asserted. 

“Ed, what are you talking about?” she said, becoming increasingly concerned and agitated.

“Dad was a junkie, wasn’t he?” I started questioning my own memory of my father. Then I remembered, we had a photo of us together, a few weeks before he overdosed. I remember him being pretty fucked up in that photo, he was late and high. “Here,” I said, rushing over to the photo on the coffee table, “look,” I held up the picture to her.

She looked at me angrily, “What the hell are you talking about Edward.” 

I looked at the picture I was showing her, and my face turned white. I saw my family, but it was different. My dad was perfectly healthy and neat, his beard freshly shaven, and his arms around me. It was too much for me to handle, so I just walked off angrily to my room. I couldn’t explain what was happening, and honestly, I still can’t.

The next day, she was normal, like nothing happened. This was fine by me, I didn’t really want to remember what happened. I thought about Lydia as the days passed, growing more and more anxious about my separation from her. I decided, on Thursday, to listen to some music. I searched through my box of records and CDs, looking for my favorite album, Pareidolia’s *God is Dead*. I looked in confusion, as it wasn’t there. Neither were any of my other Pareidolia records. 

“Mom, do you know where my Pareidolia records went?” I asked, walking into the kitchen.

“I don’t know anything about that,” she said, “since when did you have any records for a ‘Pareidolia,’ anyways?” I looked at her in confusion.

“Mom, we’ve seen them in concert multiple times,” I asserted.

“Hm,” she mumbled, “I don’t recall.” This is when I truly started freaking out. I went back to my room, glaring at my mother as I walked. I went onto my laptop, frantically searching for anything having to do with the band; and as you might have guessed from my earlier remark: there was nothing. My heart pounded as I realized there was something very wrong. That woman was not my mother. This is not my house. I am not myself.

I impatiently waited for Monday morning, the day I would return to see Lydia. I only left my room when absolutely necessary, and I was on the brink of dehydration a few times throughout this period of time. I woke up- only running on about three hours of sleep- showered, got dressed, and got in the woman’s car.

“So, Ed, ready to go back to school?” she asked.

“Yep,” I replied. I was inclined to only give her one word answers. The rest of the car ride was silent, and as soon as I arrived at my school, I was out of the car and on my way to my first period. I frantically looked around for Lydia, but her desk was empty. As I looked at the door, the bell rang.

“Hey,” I asked the boy next to me, “do you know where Lydia is?” 

“I don’t know who that is, dude,” he told me.

“You know, the girl that sits right there?” I said as I pointed at her empty desk.

“Uh, that desk has been empty the entire semester, man,” he said, looking away awkwardly. My heart dropped and my breathing was heavy. My head was pounding and my vision was blurry. He took her from me, he took Lydia from me. That fucking doctor took her away from me. I felt an intense wave of fear come over me- as if a tsunami ran right through me- and everything went black.

I woke up in my room, my mother sitting on my bed. She looked at me and played with my hair. I was disoriented and everything was blurry; plus my head pounded like crazy.

“How are you feeling, Ed? You passed out at school,” she said.

“I don’t know what happened,” I replied, trying to reorient myself. Everything slowly came back to me as I sat up, and I remembered the last moments before I passed out. She wasn’t there, she isn’t here- because she is nowhere. 

“Do you need anything, hon?” she asked. I nodded in a no, and she walked out. I grabbed my laptop in search of an answer, frantically searching through reddit and 4chan, hoping that something will help me in my return home. I needed to go back. I made a post on a burner account on a weird subreddit, it said something like this: “I woke up in the wrong universe after my tonsilectomy. Help. I need to go back.” Someone responded in the comments, asking me to check my DMs.

He said that he can help me. When he asked me for his name, he said to just call him ‘T.’ He told me that in order to go back home, I need to end this life. When he told me this, my heart dropped. I was terrified. What if it didn’t work? What if I wake up somewhere else? What if she isn’t there? He reassured me it would all be okay. I will go back if the intention is right. He told me to end my life- the wrong life- at the same time that I lost my reality in the first place. It’s currently 11 P.M., and tomorrow, I will end my life. I will see her again.



I’m writing this the next morning. It’s currently about six, and at nine, I am going to jump in front of a car on the street in front of my school. I don’t know anymore, I don’t know if I should. I’m scared. The woman in my home- my mother- her last words to me shook me to my core.

“I’ll see you later, Eddie,” she said to me. My eyes widened as my heart pounded. Is she my mother? Am I in the right place now? I sent a message to T, and he told me that she is trying to trick me into staying, and that I must go through. I trust him. He doesn’t think I’m crazy, because I’m not. I’m not crazy. Do you think I’m crazy? I will go back. See you soon.

I got some quality beans that were professionally roasted may 5 2025, so almost a month ago. Dark Roast. 

When I opened the bag, I went in to smell it like I usually do and lost my oxygen for a second 😂

It’s a harsh, almost metallic coffee smell—intensely bitter and chemical-like, as if something synthetic or scorched is lingering in the air. It feels like it strips the oxygen from your lungs for a second.

Now after a while the beans i poured out to grind didn’t have it anymore. The coffee was sort of closed in taste but not bad at all, quite nice. 

Does this mean they still need more time to settle ? By opening the bag I have set things in motion ? I always pour some in a glass sealed jar to try in another month or so, should I “burp” these glass jars when I come across beans like these ?

We've already got him a few things, candy, peanut butter pretzels, a gift card, Father's day card but I want to make him something too. 

He's not really into most of the stereotypical ""dad"" hobbies so Googling ideas hasn't been much help. He's not into any sports, he doesn't drink much, he doesn't cook, doesn't wear hats, doesn't work out, rarely wears ties, doesn't wear slippers, he's not too into: cars, history, the military, guns, hiking, hunting, gardening, reading, traveling, coffee, fishing or camping. 
We also don't need any more cup holders or coasters. 

A few things he does like: cowboy stuff (he has some cowboy boots and hats), sudoku, card games, line dancing, diet coke, board games? (We haven't played any in a while though.), McDonald's, country music, messing with our goofiest cat (he claims he doesn't like animals still 😆), and working on projects around the house (painting, fixing furniture, mowing, vacuuming, fixing cabinets, ect. He has a small work bench in the basement.), and he watches Star Trek (TOS, TNG and Voyager. But he's only a casual fan and doesn't go to any conventions or collection anything).

And his job is at a apartment complex as a sort of repairman, unclogging toilets, fixing pipes, mowing, snow plowing and a lot of painting among other stuff. 

Anyone got any gift ideas for him?

It’s usually not that bad it’s kinda stressful because I’ve never been a barista. Today after a rush with DoorDash orders and people coming into the restraunt things were getting calmer. It picked up a little I went and took this ladies order. Apparently she’s a regular and my boss made her the usual order she gets but that’s not what she ordered. 

I went back to the register as she said “I need to pay for my coffee.” And I said “okay did you want to cancel the other two coffees.” And she said “no I just want to pay for this one.” And I said “okay do you still want those other two coffees” and she said “no I just want to pay for this one.” She kept getting mad at me so I just said “wait let me get this right you want to just pay for that coffee, what’s the coffee he gave you.” BECAUSE I CANT READ MINDS AND THE ORDER YOU ASKED FOR WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE COFFEE YOU GOT. And she rolled her eyes and her tone was so rude “I just want to pay for my coffee I am in a rush and also need my pastries.” My boss told me what coffee it was I rang it in and went to get her the pastries. Then she asked for a double shot added, and then it was actually single so she was mad at me for trying to overcharge her. But you told me-?? Nvm.

And as I went to get her pastries I reached for one and she said “that’s not what I ordered.” And shook her head at me and sighed. Girl it’s a pastry I can always give you the right one. Im not about to force this muffin in your mouth tell me what you got. So she followed me to the case and pointed out her stuff. And that was fine I just wanted to get this over with. I looked up and asked if she wanted anything warmed. And she said “I never wanted anything warmed.” ITS A QUESTION I ASK EVERYONE??? And to put the icing on top of the cake after her whole “I just want to pay for this coffee” she waited till my boss came over and I was working on an order before hers. Mind you she was like 3rd in line. And she said “I need my second coffee” I ASKED YOU-😭.

Then after she said she was in a rush she sat there and talked to my boss for ten minutes after receiving her order. And then she looked at me as I was walking out the counter to hand someone their coffee, she grabbed the coffee out of my hand. I was so confused and she said “oh oops” and gave it back. Then she said “there’s a lot of stuff to learn” in a condescending tone.

1larna9,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyFishingCHS/comments/1larna9/i_got_one_more_spot_a_charleston_fishing_tale/,"I Got One More Spot"": A Charleston Fishing Tale with Captain Woods","https://reddit.com/link/1larna9/video/wte3v6jmir6f1/player

If you’ve ever fished the waters around Charleston, South Carolina, you’ve probably heard the name — Captain Woods. And if you’ve ever been on his boat, you’ve definitely heard his signature phrase: *""I got one more spot.""* A simple sentence, yet one that’s woven into the fabric of Lowcountry fishing culture.

This is a story of a day on the water that turned into a memory for life. A story that blends Charleston’s rich fishing history, its breathtaking waterways, and the old-school knowledge that only a local like Captain Woods can bring.

We shoved off from Shem Creek just after sunrise. The sky over the Ravenel Bridge was lit with fiery pinks and oranges as the tide pulled us gently toward the mouth of the harbor. With a cooler full of bait and coffee still warming our hands, our crew of four settled in for what we assumed would be a relaxing morning.

Captain Woods, a born-and-raised Charlestonian, leaned over the console and grinned. ""We’ll start with some spadefish near the jetties. If that don’t work, I got one more spot.""

That’s the thing about fishing with Captain Woods — he doesn’t just have a plan. He has plans stacked like shrimp baskets on a dock.

The spadefish came in waves, schooling beneath the boat in tight shimmering clouds. We dropped in fresh jellyballs and watched the rods bend like marsh grass in the wind. My youngest reeled in a fighter that nearly pulled him overboard — the kind of fish that you dream about when you’re sitting behind a desk. But just as fast as they showed up, they moved on.

""I got one more spot,"" Woods said again, putting the throttle down and steering us toward Bulls Bay.

Bulls Bay is where time slows down. The water flattens out, the spartina grass sways in the breeze, and oyster beds line the shallows like hidden treasure. It's also where Woods said he caught his first flounder — at age 8. ""My granddad showed me how to gig 'em under moonlight,” he told us. “Back then, we’d bring lanterns and homemade gigs. You ain’t lived until you’ve tiptoed through pluff mud with a flounder in sight.""

We worked soft plastics through the drop-offs and creek mouths. That’s when we started hitting flounder. Not the little ones either — slabs. Woods knew every contour of the bottom like it was tattooed in his mind. One flounder after another hit the deck, and just as we were thinking of calling it a day, he turned and said it again:

""I got one more spot.""

He throttled up and pointed the bow toward the south — toward Folly Beach.

We rode past the old Morris Island Lighthouse, its brick tower leaning gently into the wind, standing like a sentinel of the past. Woods talked about how shrimping boats used to dock up and down these channels, and how he worked his uncle’s trawler as a teen, sorting shrimp from bycatch for 10 bucks and a Coke.

When we anchored in a deep cut near James Island, Woods pulled out a secret bait — fiddler crabs. “Black drum and redfish can’t say no to these.”

He wasn’t wrong. Within minutes, the drag screamed, and we were in a tug-of-war with a drum that had shoulders like a linebacker. The sun had started its descent, casting long shadows across the water, and we all knew — this was the moment. The one that makes all the slow days, the early alarms, the missed texts, worth it.

Fishing in Charleston isn’t just about catching. It’s about the stories. The marsh smells. The ancient creaks of live oaks overhead. The dolphins that follow your boat, the pelicans that dive like torpedoes.

Charleston is one of the oldest fishing towns in America. Since the 1600s, these waters have provided for locals — first for sustenance, later for economy, and now for both commerce and recreation. Shrimping was once the heart of every working man in town. Families built legacies around those boats, and you can still see the rusted frames of old trawlers resting in creeks like forgotten memories.

Captain Woods honors that history. His knowledge is more than learned — it’s inherited. You can’t buy that. You can’t read that in a book. You feel it when he talks about tides, about water clarity, about how the fish bite different just before a thunderstorm rolls in. You feel it when he knows which dock has shade in the afternoon and where the biggest specks lay up in the winter.

By the end of the day, we’d caught flounder, spadefish, redfish, black drum, and even jumped a tarpon that almost spooled the reel before vanishing like a ghost. As we motored back under the Ravenel, golden light dancing off the wake, I thought about how many families have sat in the same spot, salty and sunburnt, with coolers full and hearts fuller.

And as we neared the dock, tired and happy, Woods turned one last time.

""Y’all ever fished night gigging for flounder? Because I got one more spot...""

Whether you're visiting Charleston’s historic streets, staying at an Airbnb in Goose Creek, or just passing through for a beach weekend, consider a trip out on the water with Charleston’s Reel Redemption Fishing Charters. Captain Woods will not only put you on the fish — he’ll give you a memory wrapped in salt air and laughter.

However, I am reaching my limit of being able to stand this job, and getting steadily more ashamed of approaching 40 at a basic customer service job.

I posted 277 days ago today.

Talk to my therapist via text all of the time, we meet twice a week. She holds me the whole session (head in chest). Helped me while I was injured. Had me over Christmas Day. We get coffee and go on walks. Say we love one another all of the time. 

I have told nobody in my life about the relationship and carry a deep sense of shame and alienation from the relationship. 

I know it’s wrong, and I know it will end excruciating. I know she knows she is breaking boundaries and fulfilling her personal needs at my expense. I know I will get more comments telling me to end it and report her, many angry at me. You can all tell me how badly it will go but you need to understand that at this point, I hate my life and don’t care at all about its trajectory. She can break it off with me one day when it gets too complicated, I can feel the pain, and I’ll just go die.

We are about 3-4 years from hitting our FIRE number and have been saving/investing diligently with the intent to ExpatFIRE to Japan. This year we decided to treat ourselves to a month long trip to there and set aside our anticipated monthly FIRE withdrawal amount to see what our lifestyle will be like once we move. We lived in Japan before when I was in the military, and always had a calling to return.

  
As soon as we landed we felt the familiar feeling of home. We ate amazing food everyday, coffee shops, stayed in cozy airbnb homes, rode first class shinkansen around Japan, went to Tokyo Disney, a 5 star ryokan, and a slew of other things. However we spent our last full week in our ExpatFIRE city: Yokohama.

  
In Yokohama we rented a house in Naka ward just one train ride from Minato Mirai the trendy upscale bay district. We imagined what it would be like to wake up in the morning, ride our kids to school on our ""mamachari"" bikes. After we'd ride the train into Tokyo to spend the day exploring Ginza, Roppongi, or maybe one of the tucked away smaller neighborhoods trying cafes, bookstores, and the infinite food. We'd return to Yokohama in time to meet with our Japanese tutor before picking the kids up from school and either going home, grab dinner out in the city, or even just pick up sushi from a supermarket and have a picnic in the park.

  
During holiday or weekends we would take the shinkansen to an unexplored part of Japan or take our retro Toyota minivan RV and go camping at the base of Mt. Fuji or another spot. On longer holidays we could fly to Korea, Singapore, Thailand, China, or any other SE/East Asia destination. All within a 6 hour flight. Or we may just head north to snowboard in the winter.

  
I think its important to have a vision of day to day life for ExpatFIRE. Even better if you can go test it out. My wife and I are now even more resolute in our decision to move back and make that Yokohama dream a reality :).

Someone at Baltic-Midori really looked at orbital mech deployment and said: 'You know what’s missing? A sidekick.'

Somewhere in the dust between plausibility and war crime, Baltic-Midori greenlit the SDK-89 “SKYDROPPER”—a hulking support vessel and mobile war crime built to rain mechanized annihilation directly onto outposts, bunkers, or whatever poor excuse for a settlement stood in the way. And just in case orbital mech deployment wasn’t unsubtle enough, they threw in the M.I.G.—a micro-infiltration dart built like a knife and just as polite.

The two fly in tandem, like a lockpick and a sledgehammer. The M.I.G. gets in fast, quiet, and lethal. The SKYDROPPER follows like a closing argument with legs and autocannons. Both are part of what Watchtower Technology calls a “rapid correction package.” You know, the kind you drop illegally on settlements, pirate bunkers, or anyone who parked in your landing zone without asking first. The M.I.G. breaches the perimeter. The SKYDROPPER lands with friends.

Baltic-Midori denies direct involvement. Of course they do. That’s how you know it’s real. Because nothing says “legitimate peacekeeping solution” like a mech-launcher with no transponder and a buddy ship named after infiltration.

Confirmed? No. Believed? Unfortunately.

And across the bars, docks, terminals, and chat feeds, the noise keeps leaking out:

You don’t follow something like Astral Prime. You trace its shadow and pray it’s still a shadow.

Prototype 47 left Bannoc like it had an appointment with godhood. Now it’s back—smaller, stranger, and somehow… sharper. The ship known as *Astral Prime* wasn’t on any Baltic-Midori manifest, but it flies like the next chapter in a story they thought they'd finished.

Recovered—if you believe that word still means anything—by the First Ancient on coordinates scraped from a naval ruin, Astral Prime may not be a vessel at all. It may be a vector. Because what they brought back from that red cave on Bannoc III isn’t cargo. It’s correction.

Word is, they pulled a relic out of the dirt so old it predates punctuation. “The Seed of Creation.” Capable of rewriting universes. Or maybe just your save file. Hard to tell these days. Linked to the Unity, shaped like intention, older than even the whisper-thrums in artifact code. It doesn’t glow. It *waits.* And Astral Prime waits with it—silent, sleek, and ready.

Remember what we said we few weeks ago? That the X-47 didn’t escape—it *opted out*? Well. Looks like it opted back in. This isn’t an interceptor anymore. It’s a *correction vector.* Fast, twitchy, artifact-aligned, and fully fluent in recursion.

Prototype 47 ran off like it owed nothing. Astral Prime came back like it *understood why.*

But don’t take our word for it. Here’s what the galaxy’s saying:

**— Apex Bar, Volii Alpha**  
*""Not a ship. A response. Like it heard the signal and came back with a thesis.""*

**— UC SysDef Packet Intercept**  
*“Echo registered under AstralPrime\_1.0 — confirmed recursive pulse pattern. Implication: shared memory structure with X-47. Recommend immediate blacksite escalation.”*

**— Aether Forge Ships, internal memo, <redacted>**  
*""Didn’t know the First Ancient could return. Thought Unity made that a one-way trip. Guess some doors swing both ways.""*

**— Nova Corps, Jemison**  
*""The Seed? That’s just branding. It's a rewrite function for reality. And Astral Prime? A stylus.""*

**— Blacksite Tether Post**  
*<<DATA ECHO: “if(x==origin){return self;} else {seed++}>>""*

*— Terrabrew Coffee, Akila*  
*“Still can’t decide what’s worse—the fact that it came back, or the fact that it didn’t come alone.”*

**— Blacksite Tap Intercept**  
*“Artifact link stable. Ship response loop verified. Recommend: running.”*

**— Bounty Forge, intercepted private message**  
*""Heard the relic talks. In dreams. One engineer stopped sleeping. Another stopped existing.""*

**— The Eye, Jemison Orbit**  
*""If you stare too long at its telemetry logs, you start thinking in palindromes.""*

Whatever this version is, it’s not a sequel.  
It’s a message in the language of annihilation.

So roll on 14 years later and he still lives with us. It’s getting so hard. 
He is so messy, coffee and sugar everywhere. Leaving plates, cups and spoons on the counter, above the dishwasher . His beard hair all over the counters and tables. I’ve found his hair in the cutlery drawer. Walking muck and cut grass all through the house after he has been out. 
And he doesn’t see any of it and expects me to clean up after him. 
I’ve tried talking to him. Like last night he walked grass thought the whole house and walked up the stairs with the shoes on. Said it to him this morning to take his shoes off when he comes in. 
Comes home an hour ago and straight in up the stairs with his shoes on and tries to say “oh there is no grass on my shoes”.  

He literally only sleeps here. He is in his other half’s house most of the time. We are blue in the face talking to him and it’s just falling on deaf ears. 

There is a massive housing issue here in Ireland. But I was half thinking of asking him to leave but that would make me an asshole. WIBTA?",15,1749848157.0,AmItheAsshole,23,0.89,False
1laqvgr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1laqvgr,Fuente Friday - Arturo Fuente Hemingway Signature Review,"Rolled in the Dominican Republic with a silky Cameroon wrapper over Fuente’s signature Dominican fillers, this cigar is less about loud bravado and more about refined storytelling—each puff a new chapter.

On a quiet Friday afternoon, with a black coffee I sat down to enjoy the Signature and see what tale it had to tell.

Presentation & Cold Draw

There’s no mistaking a Hemingway. That classic perfecto shape, tapered at both ends. The Cameroon wrapper was slightly toothy, slightly reddish, with fine veins and a natural sheen. Construction felt impeccable - firm, well packed, and beautifully symmetrical.

The cold draw, after a quick clip of the foot, brought sweet cedar, dried fig, graham cracker and a some baking spice. Smooth and balanced, it already hinted at the refined profile to come.

First Third – A Gentle Introduction

Lighting the small foot took a moment of patience, but the reward was instant: a mellow cloud of aromatic smoke full of creamy cedar, cinnamon, and roasted nuts. The Cameroon wrapper delivered its signature sweetness; light brown sugar with a whisper of spice.

The retrohale offered a soft tickle of white pepper and nutmeg, adding dimension without ever overwhelming the palate. The burn, despite the perfecto shape, was even and the ash held in neat, dense stacks.


Second Third – Nuance & Narrative

As the Signature opened up fully, the complexity deepened. The cedar remained, now joined by light leather, toasted almond, and a touch of citrus zest. There was a floral quality in the background; faint but pleasant - reminding me of jasmine.

The body sat firmly in the medium range, but the flavors were dynamic, dancing between sweet and savory. Draw resistance stayed perfect, offering just enough pull to keep you engaged. It was a cigar that encouraged you to slow down and pay attention - just like a Hemingway novel.


Final Third – A Poetic Finish

In the final third, the Signature grew a bit more assertive. Cocoa, earth, and a touch of anise began to show, while the sweetness of the Cameroon wrapper gave way to a more toasty, woodsy depth. The spice picked up slightly, especially on the retrohale, but never lost its elegance.

Even as it burned into the nub, the cigar remained cool, smooth, and flavorful; a true testament to Fuente’s rolling expertise. No harshness, no bitterness - just a satisfying, dignified close.


Final Thoughts

The Arturo Fuente Hemingway Signature isn’t about flashy flavors or brute strength; it’s about balance, elegance, and storytelling through smoke. It’s a cigar that rewards patience and reflection, making it ideal for mornings, early afternoons, or any time you want to slow down and enjoy the moment.

With a smoke time of about 60–75 minutes, the Signature feels timeless—an favorite that manages to feel both nostalgic and fresh. Would I smoke it again? Without hesitation.

1laqshw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1laqshw/getting_cuckolded_on_a_first_date/,Getting cuckolded on a first date?,"So I have been talking to this waitress I met at Frickers for about three weeks. The first night we exchanged Snapchat. We literally spent the entire night talking and snapping each other. But after the second week or so I noticed she was infrequently texting back and I asked if she was no longer interested or met someone else. Which is all fine. I just wanted to know for clarity so I don’t text her anymore if I’m bugging her. She got defensive and said no she’s just busy with work and stuff and we didn’t talk for three days until I apologized and she said she just needed time to think what she wants at this point. We didn’t go on a first date until the following week, which was the third week and this previous Wednesday.
How the date came about and how it went is listed below organized by ChatGPT so I don’t just ramble the timeline:

1. Park Pick-Up
	•	Time: Early evening Wednesday, you were eating at a restaurant alone and texting her about after screenshot you just sent of a music festival she wants to go to and talked about buying tickets next month. You received her out of the blue “let’s go out tonight!” immediately after this exchange and rushed home to get ready. She said her brother (apparently they lived together at age 30) and her just had margaritas at home and he was being lame and went to bed but she doesn’t want to go to bed yet. 
	•	Setting: You drove to the park she picked because she said she wasn’t comfortable letting guys know where she lives on a first date. She also said she didn’t have her car tonight that her brother and her share and as you drove there she kept rushing you saying “she’s going to go to bed soon if you’re not here” and spamming “tick tok” to hurry you. She also sent you nudes to “motivate” you to rush. You arrived, hugged, and she climbed in. You showed her the original bar that you wanted to go to and she immediately vetoed so you showed her a list of other bars and she only pushed for one of the bars on the list. You thought it was odd she was so eager for this one bar, but didn’t think anything of it at the time.

2. Arrival at Saloon
	•	First Minute (0–1 min in):
	•	You both go to sit down at the bar and she immediately says hey to one of the gentleman at the bar and tells you this is one of her regular customers at the restaurant she waitresses at down the road. You suggested she sits next to him and you can sit on the other side of her. You thought this was being polite so they could talk for a few minutes before your date.
	•	Jen’s body immediately pivots almost a full 90° away from you—hips, knees, torso all squarely facing the bar-owner guy.
	•	You only see the back of her hair; not even her cheek for almost the entire 90 minutes you were there.

3. “Just Hanging Out” (1–5 min)
	•	The bar owner asks, “What are you two doing here?”
	•	Jen responds, “Just hanging out,” deliberately omitting any mention of “date.”

4. Flirtatious Touching Begins (~5–10 min)
	•	As the bar owner talks, Jen reaches out repeatedly—placing her hand on his arm, brushing his leg, laughing into his shoulder.
	•	Her attention is fully on him, not on you. Her body is turned away and the music is blasting so her voice isn’t projecting to you and you can’t even make out every third word of the conversation. You try to interject and make conversation where you can but it’s difficult with not hearing the conversation and Jen doesn’t even motion to you, or turn her head whenever you do speak. She is constantly grabbing his arms or legs when talking to him as well.

5. First-Date Question & Face-Cover (~10–15 min)
	•	Bar owner turns towards me and her: “So… is this a first date?” You answer “yes”. This is the second time in 10 minutes he was interested in asking about what us 2 were doing.
	•	Jen covers her face and eyes with her hand for several minutes, silently enduring the question. 
	•	After 2–3 minutes of stony silence and you two gentlemen awkwardly exchanging looks, she finally mumbles, “Can we move on?”

6. High-School Friend’s Arrival (~20–25 min)
	•	Jen’s Florida high-school friend and that friend’s boyfriend walk in. The odds of her friend from Florida randomly being at this bar in Ohio on a Wednesday night is unlikely and possibly suggests she might have coordinated something beforehand to be there at that time.
	•	Jen leans in to hug her friend, introduces briefly, then says, “Mind if I hang out with her I haven’t seen her since Florida?”
	•	You agree, hoping this will reset the dynamic and let her have fun for a bit. You were also hoping she would invite you over so the 4 of you could socialize. But she grabs her drink from the seat next to you and goes down to the other side of the bar.

7. First Seating Shift
	•	Jen slides down the bar stool: her friend now on her left, the bar owner on her right.
	•	You find yourself two seats away—visibly isolated. The boyfriend comes over for 20 minutes to talk. You are unsure if it was suggested just to run interference/distract you or if he was just being polite, realizing the dynamic. 

8. Purse Retrieval Request (~35–40 min)
	•	Jen says, “Hey I need something out of my purse from your car, can I grab it?”
	•	You said you’ll get it, retrieve the purse, and return it. In hindsight, you believe she just did this so she would have her purse out of your car.

9. Bathroom Break with Purse (Immediate)
	•	Jen and her female friend head into the bathroom together—purse in hand.
	•	You remain at the bar with the bar owner and her friend’s boyfriend.

10. Friends Depart (~1 hr in)
	•	Her friends boyfriend says goodbye and moves back down to where Jen and her friend are. High-school friend and her boyfriend leave the bar. You realize she was talking to the bar owner face-to-face at this time. She notices and very slowly and reluctantly comes back to the seat next to you and plops herself down.
	•	Jen comes back to the bar stool and tells you, “Well this isn’t how I saw her first date happening.” You agree and she can tell you are frustrated. 20 Second goes by and she says “Hey I’m probably going to stay out a little longer with my friend.” You were already over this night so you didn’t think much of it, and said “Oh you don’t need a ride home then?” and she said no she doesn’t. You slightly chuckle, pay both for both of your drinks, and give her an awkward handshake as you say “Well put it there partner.” You then leave and at this time you are assuming that she is probably going to follow her Florida friend out and meet up with her since she just left.
	•	

11. Next Day
	•	You got the friends boyfriend’s number during the date and reached out to him the next morning. He said that when him and his girlfriend left the bar, they spent the entire night alone in their apartment and he never saw Jen again that night. She never rejoined them—she stayed behind with the bar owner you must have concluded. The bar owner mentioned in the earlier in the evening that his apartment is directly above the bar as well. And besides a random old woman, it was just Jen and the bar owner left as you exited the bar that evening.
	•	You then text her this as your first message “Hey how did the rest of your night go after I left? Did you end up just crashing at your friend’s place after hanging out with her? I wasn't sure how you were planning on getting home lol”
She said “Yeah we just hung out drank some more and I crashed at her place.” You then wanted to confirm and asked her “Oh cool you got to hang out with that guy I was talking to last night? Did he stay up with you?” She said “Yeah! He stayed up for a bit and then went to bed.” 

In reality, we know this not to be true because you just talked to him and he has no reason to lie or even know what what’s going on when he told you that he spent the night alone with his girlfriend and never saw Jen again.

⸻

ChatGPT Key takeaways from this sequence:
	•	Immediate, complete physical re-orientation toward someone else.
	•	Persistent, flirtatious touching of the bar owner’s arm and leg.
	•	Prolonged face-cover when confronted about being on a date.
	•	Social and physical isolation of you—two seat shifts, bathroom subterfuge, departure alone


OK, so now that is the whole timeline. And I fully realize I’m going to get the “Yeah I don’t think she likes you.” comments. I think that is an understatement. I’m just generally curious on what the heck even happened!? Like I gave her so many outs before beforehand saying we didn’t have to talk or go on a date or we could move on if she wasn’t interested. Did she literally spend a month and dozens of hours of talking just to get a six minute Uber ride to her friend’s bar and two beers out of me? Did she just have plans that night with this guy and needed a ride since he was drinking at the bar and I basically drove her to another date? It’s just so crazy because she complained that her exes would always gaslight her and lied to her and she told me that she is very honest and isn’t talking or hooking up with anyone else. (which she can because we didn’t even have our first date at the time)

But it just seems crazy to me that she literally ended up sleeping with another guy (99% chance) on OUR date. Well, I mean, she couldn’t even admit it was a date to the bar owner lol. 
We have seen each other in person before and have snapped hundreds of times so it’s not like she was turned off when she saw me. The car ride to the bar was pretty normal and fun and light. She quite literally never gave me a chance because as soon as she sat down at the bar, she didn’t look at me or even really talk to me the rest of the night. It’s not like I said something weird at the bar right away that turned her off… I quite literally never got a chance for me to mess something up that quick. I gave her plenty of easy outs before this if she wasn’t interested or attracted, she was the one randomly eager to see me this night. Did she just want to go out with her  friends/date and had me as a ride? Are there any ladies out there that could maybe clear up what you think happened to her? Did I just basically get used for a ride, two beers, and attention? I was just showing her about these music concerts that we should go to, and if she wanted to burn our relationship, I didn’t think she would burn it by using me as an Uber one time. I do want to confront her either on the phone or asking to go for coffee. What do you guys make of all of this?




TL;DR- You’d been Snapchat‐flirting with this hostess for three weeks before she suddenly went quiet after a joking “side-piece” comment and asked for space.
	2.	After apologizing, she agreed to a spur-of-the-moment first date Wednesday night and you drove her (no car) to a bar she’d recommended.
	3.	Within seconds of sitting down, she physically pivoted 90° to face a regular bar owner, greeting and touching him nonstop while ignoring you.
	4.	When he asked if it was a date, she covered her face for several minutes and then insisted they “move on.”
	5.	Her high-school friend and boyfriend arrived later, and she slid down the bar to sit between them and the bar owner, isolating you two seats away.
	6.	She sent you to fetch her purse from your car—then disappeared into the bathroom with her friend.
	7.	After her friend left, she told you she’d stay “hanging out,” and you later learned from that friend’s boyfriend she never rejoined them.
	8.	The next day she lied about crashing at her friend’s, but the boyfriend confirmed she actually stayed behind—almost certainly with the bar owner above the bar.
What in the world actually happened that night from an omniscient POV? A month just for a 6 minute ride to the bar and 2 drinks? Why go through all this? Or am I misreading something and she is just rude and not legitimately deceitful/evil?

Yes, especially if you use a light primer or hydrating cream on top. Wait 5 minutes after masking to apply.

### Freelance Marketplaces: The Global Bazaar

Why wait for the middleman? Go directly to the companies you admire. Many have remote-first cultures and post open roles on their own sites before anywhere else. Stalk their careers page like it’s your new favorite Netflix show.

Not just for suit-and-tie types. LinkedIn is a goldmine for remote gigs—if you know how to play the algorithm. Optimize your profile, connect with decision-makers, and let the offers slide into your DMs.

### Recruiters Who Get It: The New Breed

Some recruiters specialize in remote talent. They know the landscape, speak your language, and won’t try to shove you into a cubicle. Seek them out—they’re your allies.

### Industry-Specific Sites: Where Insiders Congregate

Every industry has its watering holes. Tech, writing, design, marketing—find the sites where insiders post gigs before they hit the mainstream.

### International Job Fairs—Now Virtual

Job fairs have gone digital. Attend from anywhere, connect with global companies, and land gigs that let you work from the beaches of Bali or the cafes of Prague.

### Twitter/X: The Backchannel for Opportunities

Twitter isn’t just for hot takes. Follow industry leaders, track hashtags like #remotework and #digitalnomadjobs, and slide into DMs with purpose.

### Networking IRL: Meetups, Conferences, and Serendipity

Sometimes, the best gigs come from a handshake, not a hyperlink. Attend nomad meetups, conferences, and local events. Serendipity is a job-hunting strategy.

### Building Your Own Opportunity: The Side Hustle Route

Why wait for someone to hire you? Launch a side hustle. Teach, consult, coach, create. The best nomad jobs are the ones you invent.

### The Art of the Cold Pitch: Breaking the Rules

Don’t see a job posted? Pitch anyway. Identify companies that need you—even if they don’t know it yet. A well-crafted cold email can open doors that don’t exist.

**🔥 _Take control of your income. Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential now. [Start your journey!](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Red Flags and Scams: Protecting Your Freedom

Not all that glitters is gold. Watch for scams, vague job descriptions, and too-good-to-be-true offers. Protect your freedom like it’s your passport.

### Future-Proofing: Skills That Keep You in Demand

The nomad landscape shifts fast. Invest in skills that travel—digital marketing, coding, design, project management. Stay ahead of the curve and the competition.

My last relationship, my ex was really thoughtful, he anticipated my needs. I.e having a cup of coffee ready for when I woke up, going to the shops and getting my favourite chocolate, warming the bed in winter, making me a bath. For the record I also did the same. 
I do like this guy but he never seems to do any of these little things for me. If I see him it’s always me doing these things for him. 
He’s great in lots of other ways but I just feel like him not being thoughtful already doesn’t bode well. 
I’m aware I could tell him what I wanted and I really feel like he would put effort into trying to be more thoughtful. I brought something up that was bothering me before and he really listened and took it on board and apologized. I just think telling someone to be thoughtful defeats the point. Would I even be happy he’s doing this if I’ve had to tell him to do it? I find whenever I felt he should have been thoughtful in a situation and he wasn’t, I just get the ick.

Today was my first time having an opening shift in a long while so naturally my brain was kinda gone and I was really out of it. My shift was finally coming to a close and I’m on front register. 

This man comes up to the register and I do the normal conversation starter “hi, how’s it going?”

He then told me about how today was the best day of his 60 year of life because he found out he was going to be a grandpa. He even showed me pictures of how his family told him (with a really cute embroidered “grandpa” hat) and then he ordered. 

Since he just got a drip coffee I got to write on his cup and I decided to put a few stars and write “grandpa!” on the cup. Once I handed it to him he had the biggest cheesiest smile on his face. I knew right then and there that this man was going to be the best grandpa in the world. *insert happy tears*

Anyways I hope this story brightens your day as much as mine. <3",13,1749846860.0,starbucksbaristas,1,0.93,False

1laq4gd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1laq4gd,Food items for main characters season 2,"Hi, since ya'll liked what I was doing with signature dishes as fan art , I figured Id give the season 2 gang a try. This one was a little harder , but I think the effort was worth it. 

1. The Chip: maple bacon infused cold brew and a sweet cream foam. So I love the Midwest,  a lot of my favorite memories happen in Wisconsin, and I wanted to recapture the smell of being in a George Webb at 3 am. I over brewed this a littlw so it was a lot of caffine and did not water it down , but that fits chip i think. Also this drink is like chip as it has a sweet element, but... will definitely kill. I know after 3 of these I was going to. 

2. The Mathilde (definitely not copy pasting from the wiki to spell that right) Salted caramel espresso macarons. Mathilde to me is about elegance, and precision , and to me no other French pastries scream elegance and precision than the Macron. A deep and complex coffee flavour, with just a hint of sweet. Mathilde reflects this in their personality quite a bit. They can come off as someone doing their own thing, but deep down they are a good person. 

3.The Barney. A fully loaded Ruben with all dressed chips inside for an extra crunch on dark rye. This was served with onion rings...that did not make it to camera due to me eating them. The Ruben has a reputation of being an ""old person sandwich"" and is a common sight in my local deli, but when you dig deep the combo of pickled onions, Swiss and gouda (i wanted something to calm the very sharp Swiss down)  saurkraut, thousand island and corned beef is an amazing experience.  Like some people might brush off barney as ""old crazy guy"" once we get to know him he is full of deep and interesting aspects. Also my favorite sandwich for my favorite character :)

4. The Elga. Steak Tartare. I struggled for a while to find a recipe I would be willing to do with blood as an ingredient, black pudding from the UK or Sanguinaccio Dolce from southern Italy . But I thought about a dish I would eat that has blood as a component, and a raw steak dish seemed to fit the bill. Generally seen as a rich person dish , I used dry aged wagyu beef , capers, pickles , shallots, 1 Chipotle pepper , Dijon mustard and worcestershire sauce to make it. Topped with a marinated egg yolk. Eaten with asiago sourdough slices toasted. 

This dish, like Elga comes from a fancy place , with the best ingredients, but deep down has a darker nature. Im writing this while eating it and I feel like a millionaire. 

Im gonna wait to get to know more about the Kanon team before I do them. Dug will have a giant sandwich I think. I might come back to this to make some side character dishes , like Brink or the Alchemist.

1laq442,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1laq442/you_gain_the_ability_to_dispense_any_5_liquids/,You gain the ability to dispense any 5 liquids from your fingertips. Which ones do you choose and why?,"With the added benefit that whatever liquid you dispense will be unable to cause any physical harm to your hand or finger during the process of you dispensing it. So if you choose to dispense hot water, it will not burn your finger, but if you dispense it so it drops on the rest of your body, it will still burn you.

You can choose the temperature of the liquid you dispense, but you cant change it after locking it in. So for example you can choose to dispense cold water or hot water but if you want to do both, you need to use 2 fingers to do so.

You can control the pressure, how much of the liquid is coming out, kind of like a garden hose. There will be a limit of how far you can shoot the liquids lets say around 10 meters at max. And the amount of liquid in the ""beam"" you shoot is maxed to be the diameter of your finger.

I will choose:

1. Liquid gold. This is purely to make money, I will dispense the gold into molds and sell it once hardened.  

2. Water at 40 degrees celsius. Because this is hot about the max temperature to use for showering safely. Since I already have enough money from the gold to get all the coffee and cola etc I would want, I am now only concerned with what I actually would need for survival if things get bad. Its not too hot to drink, so hydration is taken care off. It will let me have a warm shower and keep myself clean.  

3. Broth or soup, specifically one that has all the nutrients, vitamins, minerals etc. that a human would need, essential and non essential. I can live off from this alone if I ever need to, and dont have to worry about getting nutrient deficiencies.  

4. Liquid antibiotic drugs, such as peniccillin. This will allow to treat bacterial infections that could happen in survival situations.  

5. Liquid molten steel. This is good because it gives me a source of heat and fire. With this I can also build things from metal, all kinds of tools, even structures. It would be extremely usefull in a long term survival situation. Making tools of all kind, knives, hammers, saws, shovels. To building materials like nails. A thin stream could be used to make steel wire. Pots, pans and other cooking utensils could be made. ",6,1749846181.0,CasualConversation,7,1.0,False

The few ""obscure, unfortunate incidents"" that can be traced to her are clearly someone else's fault, like how Jorge forced her to drink, his family forced her to self-defense him to death (not intentionally), former ""husband"" forced her to call every day for 13 weeks because he wouldn't buy her damn coffee and Delicious Delights package, and apparently each and every one of us is responsible for her spending the rest of her life in prison.

The plan is the stain the wood walnut, then finish it with pure tung oil and then may add a layer or two of wax finish. 

Currently I have sanded it back to bare wood. There are some dents, gouges (no deeper then 2-3mm) and gaps in the knots. I have collected the saw dust while I have been sanding it. 

Question: can I stain this saw dust (once dry) mix it with pure tung oil into a paste and use it as woodfiller? Then allowing the tung oil to fully cure before sanding it.

EDIT: The idea is to apply pre conditioner before applying two layers of walnut solvent stain, then finishing it with pure tung oil. 

This is the thought process of applying the saw dust mixed with pure tung oil as filler before  the pre conditioner and the wood stain in hope that the filler will nicely blend in.",2,1749846029.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,1.0,False

Hope the week has been going well for you so far. Most of my friends are travelling at various points this summer, and I find myself with a bunch of free time. I'm looking to expand my social circle and meet new people. Ideally, someone I can do various activities with - like watching movies at the cinema together, checking out new cafes and restaurants, going on walks around downtown this summer, playing sports and/or going to the gym together. I'd describe myself as an ambivert, so I also enjoy spending time at home. I live in Downtown Toronto and can host. If you're into cuddling and enjoy watching movies/TV shows, then we'd be a great match. I love being the big spoon, but I'd also be keen on trying out other cuddle positions once we get to know each other better.

My work schedule during the week is from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., so I've plenty of free time in the evenings and on weekends. I'm an easygoing person who enjoys deep conversations, good food, coffee, and I'm looking to make a new meaningful connection.

I decided I needed to do something about it, that nobody else it gonna come and save me. 

So lately I signed up for therapy, I have put in an application to start volunteering (hoping to slowly build up to getting a job but need to start small so I don’t retreat back to hermit life), I met up with a guy I’ve been talking to online for a year, I’ve been calling another online friend and also I have been making sure I leave the house everyday…even if it’s just to grab a coffee or sit on a bench and write. 

But wow I’m so proud of myself, I’ve done things that I had previously thought impossible and I showed myself I could do them. I felt insane amounts of anxiety during all of this but I still did them anyway and that feeling you get afterwards is unmatched. I go to bed at night not feeling like I’m wasting my life away but feeling accomplished and proud that I’m taking steps to better myself!

Hopefully it makes somebody smile. 

I had a coworker who worked at the same restaurant as me for years. We are a pretty close group there with low turnover and a fairly small staff. He was loved by everyone and many coworkers and customers had known him for nearly a decade from working with him/being a guest previously in the industry. From the start, he had had cancer for years that was being managed, but from my understanding wasn’t something he would likely recover from just live with. Last year, he ran out of treatment options and got sicker until he was unable to work by mid May and then went on to hospice at home and passed in early June. 

This Sunday was the one year anniversary of his death. My wife (who also works at the same restaurant as me) and I went to go get coffee from a local chain like we do almost every Sunday. On our way back, taking the same route home as usual, she noticed a real estate sign where the agent’s name was the same name as him. Neither his first or last name are super rare, but it’s also not really common either. It made us both smile and cry. He frequently brought in coffee from this same chain when he came into work and would sometimes offer to get me one or vice versa if I was stopping to get one on my way. I can imagine that it was his sassy way of saying “and you didn’t get me a coffee?” ",12,1749845702.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

I’m a 22 year-old guy based in London, and I’m here to build real, long-term friendships - the kind that ideally includes meeting up in person eventually. I think it’s hard to form genuine bonds without shared experiences beyond a screen.

Who I’m hoping to connect with:

Aged 18–26

Based in the UK (even better if you’re also in London or nearby)

Open to eventually meeting in person - whether it’s for coffee, concerts, or just to hang out


A bit about me:

⚽ Football fan — I play weekly

🤘 Big into rock & metal — always down for gigs

🎮 Gamer — mostly into single-player games across genres

🎬 Into Marvel and all things nerdy

🏎️ I love go-karting and visiting theme parks

🧠 Neurodivergent — emotionally aware, open-minded, and a good listener

What I’m not looking for:

One-word replies

Inconsistent or low-effort conversations

Surface-level chats with no intention of building something real

What I am looking for:

People who want real connection and are willing to put in effort

Comfortable with chatting regularly, maybe gaming or voice calling

Open to hanging out or doing things in person down the line


If you’re messaging me, please include your age, gender, location, and a bit about yourself, just to show you actually read this and want to connect.
