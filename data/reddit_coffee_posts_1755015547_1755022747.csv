1mogewx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1mogewx/my_sister_physically_abuses_me_and_my_parents_do/,My sister physically abuses me and my parents do nothing about it (extreme long),"I (F17) have had a difficult relationship with my sister (F23) since we were young. Obviously we had the typical sibling arguments and would make up in an hour or so. On January 23, 2023 we had our first real physical altercation where we actually threw pouches at each other. She was organizing my nieces toys in the living room and sent her to the kitchen for a bag for the trash. I was in the process of making food so I pointed her to where they were. I was sick, I had a fever, was so irritated and she started acting dumb I opened the cabinet under the sink and told her to grab it. She continued saying where is it where is it laughing so I knew she just wanted me to grab it for her,and I deeply do regret this but I grabbed the top of her head and under her chin (not her neck her chin) moved it to the cabinet under the sink where the plastic bags were at she stared at me grabbed the bag and immediately ran to my sister saying I choked her. Obviously mama bear mode flipped in her and she came at me, cornered me and was screaming in my face. I told her to get out of my face because I didn’t choke her. At this point she was so close to my face I could feel the spit when she would talk landing on my face so I did not even push I slightly put my hand on her shoulder and pushed her away from me. This is were she grabbed me by my hair and we started fighting. At this time I was 13 and 115 pound while she was around 19-20 and 200 pounds. I was obviously overpowered. By the end of the fight she had me on the ground and it took my grandpa and dad to get her off of me. Next day she tried to talk to me and I ignored her because I was obviously still very mad, and I went no contact with her. She then apologized in May 2023 and we were on speaking terms again until July 2023.

She was not working and we always clean for my mom while she’s at work when I am home from school. Everything was clean but the dishes in the kitchen where my sister was eating. She came to my room and told me to come wipe down the counters and wash the dishes I left my room and saw that her plate was out and some other stuff she was putting on her food. I told her i’d do it after she’s done eating. We’ve had minor arguments over this same situation where i was cleaning the counters and she was eating and got mad. She immediately got heated I went back to my room and she came and opened my door and told me she wasn’t leaving until I went to wash the dishes I tried pushing her out of my room and she scratched me up in the process, took my phone, threw it in the neighbors yard, and left the house. I went no contact with her until September 2023 where my grandma broke her back and ended up in the hospital.

We got into a minor argument in February 2024. (she does not let anyone eat any of the food she buys). I got home from school and she was making my niece some dinosaur chicken nuggets I had bought. I made a joke around the lines of can I eat the stuff you buy now. She immediately got mad and said she doesn’t let me have any of the food she buys bc I eat it all. She got mad and didn’t talk to me so I didn’t talk to her. Next day at school she stole my baking power (makeup) and I immediately noticed because i keep them on my vanity stacked with another powder. I went in her room and not surprisingly it was on her desk. I checked the bottom of it because i have black hearts on all of my stuff because i have a sister and we get ready together and didnt want our stuff getting mixed up. I immediately told my mom she she called her because at the time she was at the gym w a dude. She answers denies she took it and her and the dude start laughing. Which is like hello you took it out of my room without asking, get caught, and then deny it? I went no contact with her again.

Another minor disagreement in March 2024. At this time my great grandpa passed away and my mom was in Mexico, and at this time my mom, dad, and sister all worked at the same place so they got days off. I came back from school and I saw my clothes was on a shoe rack. I went down and checked the dryer it was empty and my clothes was all wrinkled so I put the clothes back in so they can heat up a little and I won’t have a bunch of wrinkled clothes i have to iron. I went up to my room and as I was coming back with more clothes I see my sister taking out my clothes and putting hers in. So I was mad because the washer had been done she was home all day nothing was cleaned so she clearly wasn’t busy enough to not pay attention to her clothes. I start putting my clothes back and that’s when we start shoving each other and she puts hers arms around me and starts calling for my dad and he gets her off of me. I understand that I shouldn’t have put my hands on her in this moment especially over a dryer. I  received my consequences and was grounded for around a week and a half. After this fight she kicked me out of all out streaming services and canceled my phone so I had to get a new phone.

During this my school had a weird week with act testing and practice act so I was home mostly all week. My boyfriends sister had a soccer game and she had asked me to go so I was cleaning making food and on my best behavior with my parents so I would be able to go. Asked my mom and she gave me the green light and I was officially ungrounded. Game was at 4 and it was around 2 I was grilling chicken for a salad and cutting it up on the counter right next to the stove. My sister got home and immediately got to making an egg for my niece and multiple times bumped into me and I remained calm because I knew it was on purpose and I wanted to go to the game. I was still cutting the chicken where the went in front of my torso to open the utensil drawer I was standing in front of. I told her something along the lines of you can say excuse me , and she said why would I. So I pushed the cabinet in with my body and that’s when she grabbed my arm that had the knife. I froze not wanting to move because I wanted to go to see my boyfriend. She kept yelling at me to drop the knife as if I had picked it up and pointed it at her like okay weirdo. My mom came out of her room and she let me go which made the knife fly out of my hand and she went to her room yelling how she was going to kill me and that she’s been wanting to put her hands on me for a while. ( I have this all audio recorded). I ended up getting grounded and ungrounded the next day. I went no contact with her again

Next Physical fight we had was in October 2024. Got home from school my mom was making food and my sister was leaving for the gym. My niece was upset the food wasn’t ready and ran off to her little tent and was bawling. So I went and I was like cmon let’s go eat some fish nana has it ready and she yelled no and slapped me so hard my head turned to the side. I pushed her and told her to next slap me again and I went and told my mom and showed her. She called my niece to wash her hands and she told my mom I PUSHED HERR. Remember that. My mom swatted me on the but joking around and my niece got mad and ran to her room. I’m unsure if my niece called my sister or if she forgot something but my sister ended up coming back and my niece told her once again that I choked her. My mom i think suspected something was up and went to their room and i heard my sister screaming about how she has told me to stop putting my hands on her daughter and that this is the second time i’ve choked her. So i yelled something along the lines of I didn’t choke her maybe if you payed attention to her she wouldn’t say things like that to get your attention. She got immediately heated and started coming at my trying to jump over my mom as she was in between us. She threw my backpack and broke some sticks my teacher gave me for a project basically all the dramatics. She reached over my mom, yanked my hair and I defended myself. My parents separated us, and I ran to my room and called the police. Her dude friend came, and started lecturing my mom about what could happen to my sister and my niece if the police get involved. Which i’m not stupid i know what could happen and that’s exactly why I called them. My sister left.The police arrived and said they really couldn’t do anything because she wasn’t there and I didn’t have any scratches or bruises on me other than a red mark where she slapped me. She ended up with a couple scratches and a bruise on her eyelid. Again I continued with no contact.

Our biggest fight happened on January 8th, 2025. At this time she was jobless and had gone to an interview. I was in the kitchen and i have a bad habit of putting my leg on the stool next to me. She gets home and starts heating up her food with her phone on max. I was ignoring her because i know it’s just to aggravate me. Next thing i know the chair is pulled away from me and in this moment i know i messed up but i froze and i kept my foot on the chair and she was pulling it i realized what was happening i stood up and was about to walk by her when she grabbed my hair and we started fighting. My grandpa separated us I went to my room and called my dad. I thought she left as that’s what she does after every fight so I went out and i hear her screaming at my dad about how i choke her daughter and put my hands on her and i say i don’t touch your daughter i don’t even talk to her anymore stop using that as an excuse to put your hands on me. She comes at me again yelling in a b word and we fight again during this it’s not even throwing punches it’s trying to get her off of me so i’m trying to kick her off scratching at her arms so she can let my hair go. she goes to her room and i end up sitting with my grandpa trying to calm him down as he has asthma. The second he calms down and says he’s okay my sister comes out running yelling i’m a b word and i ruined her life. we fight again we get separated again this goes on another 3 or 4 times where she comes at me and we get separated. In the end she’s rocking side to side as if there was an invisible wall she couldn’t cross yelling things at me. I’m sitting down on the couch with my dad grabbing my arms and his back to her. I say dude you’re a bum get a life she yells oh i’m a bum i’m a bum and throws a glass mineragua at me and i get soaked in the water. It ends she goes to her room and i’m begging my dad to let me call the police on her and he refuses. Out of respect I don’t and we’re on the stairs and i hear a knock on the door so i open it thinking it was my dad and behold her knight in shining armor sneaky link is at the door i immediately shut the door because i have no reason to deal with him and he begins pounding on the door like a police officer i open the door and i start yelling at him saying who do you think you are coming to my door like that. He starts saying oh well if you knew things were heated why didn’t you just leave. Hello??  At this point i know what my sister has been feeding this bald headed idiot and i get mad i say your girlfriend is a grown woman she should know when something is right or wrong and she equally knew how things were why aren’t you yelling at her with this. He says this goofy ass thing talking about some if you took a polygraph test would you pass. I said yeah dork because i didn’t touch my niece. My dad respectfully tells him he didn’t appreciate the way he came at me and arrived at his house and asks him to leave. Ig he told my sister but she came and let him in. Around this time I hear the police arrive. I’m scared shitless because i know that she has real bruises and actual scratches on her so lm texting my boyfriend what happens and that if i go to jail ill call him. She called the police. Admitted to them that she hit my first bug failed to mention she came at me 6-7 times. The police officer told me he couldn’t just let this go this time like the last officer because there was harm inflicted to a minor. So she got arrested spend 3 days in jail and spent a month at her best friends house when she told my parents she couldn’t afford living on her own and her best friend of around 10 years couldn’t have her at her house anymore. She returned in February with the promise of her moving out in less than 2 months. She’s still here.

Things have been somewhat calm other than her throwing my wet clothes on the floor, sorting out my clothes from my moms when drying, throwing away my food, her thinking she’s not washing my dishes (i wash my dishes the second i’m done with them so??), her leaving messes for me to clean as i am on summer break.

August 9th me, my mom, dad, and a friend of mine were going to the carnival. I was at my grandmas prior, and she lives and hour away. So as soon as me and my mom woke up we got coffee and breakfast sandwiches, and we left to pick up the carnival tickets. I got home showered, and since we spent the night i had my lotions and makeup in my bag which was in my moms room i waited till my sister went into her room and i left to get them. As i was coming back from my moms room my sister leaves her room, and so im going and she’s coming. i turn my body so we wont bump into each other, and from me half turned she still managed to shoulder bump me. I didnt move more because from me turned it was enough for both of us to pass the hallway. Prior times we’ve bumped into eachother like this she never moves so i’m tired of the disrespect towards me. We shoulder bump each other my mom says to stop with this, and i tell my mom she didn’t move. She called me a b word and I went on my way to my room because I don’t have time to deal with her childish teenager act. I get to my room and i hear a crash and i immediately knew she broke my Hello kitty cup. I don’t really collect hello Kitty but that was my only mug and it was pretty expensive as it cost me $30. When i got home from the carnival i search the trash and i find my cup and my smushed up breakfast sandwich. I tell my mom she did it on purpose im crying hysterically at this point because im so mad and she keeps telling me my sister didn’t do it on purpose. I’m mad because it’s my money going to waste and i start looking for all her mugs and plates bowls and glass cups. Mysteriously after my cup breaks she takes all her things to her room. I know i seem crazy but i grew up around her i know how she is and i know how she thinks. I immediately knew it wasn’t an accident because the mug is so big i only use it to eat soups or ice cream sundays. Plus the mug was in between another larger mug and a measuring cup at the top of the cabinet so it’s not just going to accidentally fall and break without the others breaking as well . Next day Sunday I get ready to shower and when i go to use my conditioner it’s empty. I was confused because i had showered that day prior and it was not even half way empty. I thought maybe i left it open and it spilled. I use the remainder of the conditioner and im rinsing my hair i grab my murad face wash wow Unsurprisingly empty too. I tell my mom “ My cup accidentally breaks, my breakfast sandwich is accidentally thrown away, and now the only two things i bought with my own money are gone, but yeah it was a mistake mom.” My mom confronts her and my sister denies it. I don’t have any other siblings my parents wouldn’t do that because they’re grown adults so i’m left feeling crazy. My mom tells her she needs to stop with the childish acts or she’ll have to find somewhere else to live because her petty antics are costing her money. My sister says she can’t kick her out because my mom doesn’t pay the house and my grandpa does (my grandparents live with us and cant work but still help my mom with half of the mortgage). My mom says then based on your logic don’t grab the black car anymore and get your own car (My dad would let my sister use his car when she first got her license but then my sister claimed it as her car, never pays any of the notes and absolutely doesn’t pay the insurance & the car is all banged up from her getting into accidents).

Through this past year I have been in a deep depression as i feel abandoned by my parents as i feel they’re taking her side. I understand they can’t kick her out and leave her on the streets with my niece but her being here is costing me mentally. My parents refuse to let me tell any of my cousins what happened as they’re going to tell their parents and spread it around. I truly don’t care and i feel as if they deserve to see what i have to deal with. I also don’t understand how i ruined her life i’ve taken her side in arguments i knew she was in the wrong in and strained my relationship with my parents for her. My dad tells me it’s jealously because of how she spent her teen years and how im spending mine. My sister got pregnant at 14 and gave birth at 15. She didn’t finish highschool and is 23 with a 8 yo daughter who’s father is not present, no car, no highschool diploma or ged, and working at hobby lobby as a cashier. I truly feel as if it’s early enough for her to turn her life around. I know she’s doing these things to try and provoke me to start a fight but cps had been involved and already threatened to take my niece away if she continues to argue and start fights with me. I’m currently at a loss as i know that the only way to save myself from this is leaving or pressing charges on her but i feel empathy for my niece as much as i feel this is her fault. I know i didn’t do anything wrong but i know other people may not feel that way. I’m currently scared she’ll do anything to get me heated up and fight her, and as much as i’m avoiding her she’s  still finding ways to get in my way and start something. She truly thinks she and her daughter are the victims in this situation but i don’t feel that way. I know i could just be taking my own side. I’d love to hear what others think on this situation and get feedback on how i can improve my behavior around her. I don’t wish to start problems with her but i can’t help it if she keeps bumping into me getting in my space and spilling things on me. Thank you if you’ve read this far but it’s so much to the story and i still had to leave a lot of things out.💗💗",1,1755022581.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1mogemj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1mogemj/can_i_help_my_boyfriend_with_his_inability_to/,Can I help my boyfriend with his inability to handle stress?,"If my boyfriend experiences a few setbacks, he has a tendency to let it snowball and become a bigger deal than it is. I'm worried about how this might affect us in the future.

For example - one time we missed our flight because he got the time wrong. It was understandable as he had been super stressed and sleep deprived due to work. He was super hard on himself about it as he is a bit of a perfectionist and he considered this a failure. I'm pretty chill and these things don't bother me, I am good with just letting it roll off my back.

The next day he tried to make breakfast and burned the pancakes, it set off the smoke alarm. 

This combined with the flight being missed put him in a bad headspace. Because of the pancakes burning, he didn't have a coffee, then got a headache, etc. I tried to comfort him but somehow it got into a conversation about work which made him more stressed, he said he just needs time alone to process and was appreciative I tried to help. I let him have that alone time but then he got worried I was upset at him, I wasn't.

I know life gets more stressful later on. We want to have kids. I'm pretty sure there might be a situation where everything is going wrong and kids are screaming in the backseat which makes everything worse. I am afraid of what he will be like in that scenario when there is no option to just be alone and process things. I don't want to carry the emotional burden of the whole relationship in a situation like this, I want someone who can stay calm and patient even when it feels like the world is on fire. 

Have you guys improved on patience after kids or, as did you mellow out as you got older?

To be fair he has improved a LOT after we first started dating, he used to be a lot worse. He has never taken out his anger on me or even yelled at me.

I've been having a blast with my Echo mini! I spend about $80 USD for the audio player and headphones. I was getting increasing frustrated of music apps on my phone and having an ad pop up every time I wanted to change a song. I have never been too fond in streaming music because I don't want to pay a monthly sub just to listen to some tunes. I listen to a lot of VGM so much of the OST are not on Spotify. Even if they were, I have no interest in giving money to Spotify or YT.  

The battery life isn't bad, I've spent about 4 hours at a time and only went down half battery. I'm not an audio expert but what I can say is that the headphones have such a great base! 

This small device is very compact and it's been doing the job extremely well. It isn't perfect, as the buttons on the top are very clicky. Not really ideal for sitting in a chill coffee shop. The interface could also use a lot of work with controlling the volume and switching the tracks, which can be very annoying. While the screen is in sleep mode, if you press and hold down the volume down button, it switches tracks. But I am so used to holding down the volume keys to lower the music quickly. This does not allow you to remap the buttons, which I hope that will be a feature in a future update.  The headphones are top tier and worth the money! However, the volume controls on the headphones do not work with the device, unfortunately. 

Despite this I am very happy with my purchase and super exited to start the journey of separating from my phone! Thanks to this community for helping me decide! I've been lurking for a while here and I love seeing the many Daps! ",1,1755022561.0,DigitalAudioPlayer,0,1.0,False

I know almost nothing about sleep apnea, but I found it strange that the result was ""mild,"" since the fatigue I feel is anything but mild. It's been 3-2 years since it started and has been getting worse ever since. This year the symptoms impacted my life so much that my mother finally took me to the doctor.
For a good night's sleep, I need 14 to 17 hours of sleep, and even then, I feel tired all day and have ""sleep attacks."" Sometimes they're weak and short, other times strong and long, so intense that my brain slows down, I feel dizzy, and I feel like I'm going to pass out. I get so tired that my body ""hurts."" It's not the normal kind of pain; I just don't know how to explain it better. It's like an ""ache"" or discomfort, as if my body is already asleep or trying to make me pass out. It leaves me weak and I have to sit down.
I often end up falling asleep unintentionally. This happens anywhere: on the bus, in the car, at school. I've even fallen asleep standing up and feel like I'm almost dozing off while walking. I can't pay attention in class or studying because I fall asleep even when I'm writing, or I have microsleeps that leave my memory completely confused. Sometimes I fall asleep without even realizing it. I can't focus in class because I sometimes fall asleep in less than 2 minutes. When I'm not sleeping, my brain is so slow that I can't learn anything or do basic reasoning. No matter how hard I try, I can't stay alert. Drinking water doesn't work, coffee has a very short effect on me, or sometimes it doesn't even work, moving around doesn't work either. I don't take naps during the day because if I sleep, it will be for 8 hours straight, otherwise it doesn't make a difference. 
I'm relieved to finally have a diagnosis, but I'm really confused about how this is mild.

Even though I’ve previously lost 20kg with weight loss, after Covid I have gained it back and ever since have been trying to lose it but have fallen in bad bad habits.

I want to lose 20kg by end of October? I’m 86kg, 5’8 and male.

It’s currently Tuesday, so I can start fasting now and break by Saturday. I have a family outing then.

After that, I can do a straight 13 day fast, on the 14th day I have another outing.

Then In September, I can do straight 5:2 (5 days fasting, 2 days eating) 

All the way until October

Will I be able to get to 65-70kg by then?

The clerk said “he has his back to me, it’s not time for you to know.” This occurred while I had just initiated no contact with a family member due to various reasons. It felt comforting to know someone was by my side. Now it’s been a year and I’ve been thinking about these experiences lately, wondering how to make a connection with this person or thank them.

Surely, many of you have done all the techniques like the Law of Assumption, subliminals, scripting, and others… and they didn’t work at all, so you start thinking that all of this is just a lie and you cannot change yourself!
But I want to tell you, my friend, that you are 100% wrong.

Beliefs:
There are many people who advise something called detach… it is really useful, but the problem is that the idea of detach is not presented correctly. Many people, when they talk about detach, it’s as if they are telling you: “make the mirror your enemy, and anything that shows your reflection—you must not wait, and, and, and…”
That’s completely wrong!
I will explain how to use it, but now I just want to tell you the false beliefs.

The second belief is the belief of some people that the result is in changing your appearance, meaning in your 3D world.
The third and last is that many people say: if you face any bad thought about the thing you’re trying to change, completely ignore it!
That is the biggest mistake…

Alright, my friend, you must know this thing—it is the key to programming your subconscious mind and changing your cells and DNA and everything you want. Yes, you can change anything.
What is this key???
You must choose one thing inside you:
Either negative thoughts
Or positive thoughts.
They can never, ever exist together!
Like the positive sign and the negative sign—they always repel each other, it is impossible for them to meet!

It’s the same with thoughts—if your thoughts are mixed between negative and positive, you will be completely unstable!
If you are completely negative, then you are in danger and will be a failure forever—don’t dream of success if you are negative!
And if you are completely positive? Congratulations, my friend, this is the key to your mind—you will program it very easily.

You must be completely positive—all your thoughts positive, with no negative thought about yourself, others, or the world!!!!
If you are completely positive, you can change the world with your energy, my friend.

Alright, how can I be completely positive? Is it difficult?
Of course not—it is extremely easy!

How to become completely positive without even a drop of negative thoughts?
First, take a paper and write down all your negative thoughts and feelings, etc. I want you to write every single detail of every negative thing toward yourself or anything in your life. This method is not only for changing appearance—it’s for life as well.

When you feel that you are free from any negative thought, now you have the choice:
	1.	Burn the paper
	2.	Tear it up

If you want to burn the paper, burn it and imagine a person in front of you—ugly looking, with a black aura, foul-smelling—imagine them burning with the paper. When it finishes burning, imagine them turning to ash, then the wind carries them away.
You will feel relieved, and if you don’t, repeat it more than once.

It’s the same if you want to tear it—imagine it tearing in front of you in the same way, and then the wind carries it away in the same way.
When you finish, do breathing exercises, smile, and laugh.

Rebirth:
After that, take another paper—this will be addressed to your old self! A farewell letter to your old self.
At the beginning of the letter, thank yourself for protecting you from the changes you wanted, thinking that this change would hurt you… thank her and go deep in thanking her, then say:
“Thank you for protecting me from the changes I wanted, but I feel more comfortable with my new self and with these changes. I’m sorry, but you used to cause me anxiety and lack of confidence in myself.”
And so on—this is an example, you can write it in any way you like, and write the qualities that make you feel more comfortable and why.

This is the beginning of your birth as the version you want. Say goodbye to her and apologize to her at the end of the letter in your own way that your old self will understand.

Write from “your old name” to “your new name,” put your signature, read it out loud (not silently), and then burn the paper or tear it like I mentioned before. But this time, imagine that it is you—the self you want to get rid of—holding the paper, and then disappearing with the tearing or burning—this is your choice.

Now you have gotten rid of two things:
Your negative thoughts and your old self.
This is the strongest point in programming the subconscious mind.

Last step:
Take a new notebook and write in it your new qualities and your new appearance in precise detail, with feelings of gratitude and positivity. Write your wonderful feelings toward these new qualities. Describe your life, the people you want around you—anything you wish for. Describe it in detail, in the past tense.

Finally, go and treat yourself to a drink you like, a food you love, or anything you like. Go buy yourself something you want. Or if you are the sporty type who feels great after exercising, go work out. Or drink your favorite coffee from your favorite place, watch a movie or your favorite show.
Do something you love. If you want, smile, laugh, be kind, be friendly. Every time your mind reminds you of your old self, just tell yourself: “I was born again, I was completely born again.” The percentage of remembering your old self will be extremely small!

Now you will feel the best feeling—stand in front of the mirror, thank yourself, smile, and praise yourself. Praise yourself in a narcissistic way. When you move or walk, walk with confidence as if you are the king of this Earth! As if there are cameras or everyone is watching you! Feel happiness and confidence..!
Even if there are people criticizing you or commenting on your appearance—don’t be silent! Defend yourself simply. Don’t accept this thing—even if it’s from your family. Tell them: “I love my appearance, and I am grateful for this appearance!”

If you feel a 4D change (your inner environment), congratulations on the results, my friend, because this is the greatest result—if you have reached the feeling of total positive energy, then you have reached a result that millions have not achieved. (This is one of the false beliefs—that change is in your 3D world.)

Now, how do I see the change in 3D?
I want to tell you—don’t wait for the 3D change (your current appearance). Don’t wait for it—it is coming 100% if you really changed your 4D and made it completely positive.

Alright, if I face a negative thought, what should I do? Should I ignore it?
Of course not. Don’t ignore it, and don’t give it importance at the same time—face it and address your mind: “No, you are completely wrong…” (and correct the negative thing in a positive way you want, with sincere feelings). Correct it and talk to your mind as if it’s a person in front of you—you will feel the difference, and the thing you felt negativity about—repeat it in a positive way. Don’t ignore it and leave that negative idea in your mind—replace it with positive words. (This is one of the beliefs I mentioned at the beginning.)

Alright, now we must stabilize the qualities we want to change—how?
There are many, many ways—the first is the well-known Law of Assumption. I don’t want to explain it—it’s the best thing, but you must imagine with feelings, not just imagine! Imagine with feelings that you have had this thing before!

Another way is writing or scripting (well-known, you can search for it)—same thing, with sincere feelings, at any time you want.

And now we come to detach.
Alright, I agree with ignoring seeing the results, but the idea of not looking at the mirror is completely wrong! You must see yourself in the mirror—not to see the results, but to thank yourself and cleanse your eyes with this gorgeous, attractive appearance. Thank yourself, praise yourself, love yourself through your mirror. Look at the mirror anytime you want—the mirror will miss this beautiful face.

What’s the use of ignoring results without believing that you already have the results? You must see yourself as if you have already gotten them so that your subconscious mind does not see it as a message of lack!
You must move and speak as if you already have the results!

Alright, the last technique—and I love it—is listening to subliminals. My advice to you is to listen while sleeping and after waking up—the best times to program your mind, because during these times you enter a state of relaxation and calm called the alpha state.

Don’t listen to 20 subliminals—1 or 10 is more than enough. Your mind is powerful—you don’t need to repeat the title a million times. Listen to a subliminal that has one title, another subliminal for another title, and so on.
When listening, set your full intention on increasing and enhancing your beauty—not getting beauty!

We’ve reached the end.
I just want to tell you—this is my method, and during the past month, I discovered these things. I wanted to share them with you. I love you all, and to whoever reads this—I intend for you to have beauty and a wonderful life like you. If you have any questions, write to me in the comments.
Sorry for any spelling, contextual, or any kind of mistake!
Goodbye ❤️

My set up:

* ACS Vesuvius v2 (pressure profiling dual-boiler e61 machine)
* Kafatek Monolith Flat
* Puck prep: Saint Anthony Industries Bloc Party, Subminimal Flick WDT tool
* Scales: Lunar Acaia for shots and Subminimal Subscale for weighing beans

I also have the Weber Workshops bean counter and cellar pictured on the right, but I never use them and will likely sell to free up some space.

In theory this is my end game, but I can totally see myself upgrading the machine and grinder in the future. :) ",4,1755022245.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1mog7sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1mog7sm/terran_embassy_complaints_department/,Terran Embassy Complaints Department,"I wanted to run late for work, but the unwritten rule was if you show up late for your shift at the complaints desk you’ll be assigned to the complaints desk for a week. I had made that mistake once, and I was determined to never make it again. One shift every two weeks was more than enough for any of us before we’d start considering stabbing our eyeballs out with a dull pencil. I set the coffee machine to fill my travel mug while I threw on a pair of pants and found my gray Terran Embassy uniform shirt complete with my oversized nametag. I flipped through the news on my datapad and checked messages, taking my time to try to keep my mind off the upcoming train wreck that is the Terran Embassy Complaints Department.

‘Enough procrastinating,’ I thought to myself as I made sure I had my ID card and double checked my belt pouch of necessities. Everything in order, I steeled myself for the day.

Coffee in one hand and mar’ba’qua Meal Replacement Paste in the other, I stepped out of my apartment and headed for the elevator. Luckily, the monorail station was just around the corner and it took me less than a minute at a brisk walk to step up onto the platform. At least something in the universe seemed to be looking out for me as I waited less than 30 seconds before the next transport arrived. 

One monorail ride with a surprising lack of other passengers followed by a brisk walk and I was walking through the embassy back employee entrance and heading to the break room. It was 8:44am on the clock, just enough time to participate in the Complaints Department pre-game ritual.

Step one, refill coffee. Step two, gather in a circle in the corner of the break room and politely chat about meaningless crap to keep your mind off the impending doom. Step three, the moment the clock hits 8:58, march as one complete unit to the operations area and take a seat at a desk behind a wall of glass. Step four, press the opener and get swarmed by unhappy xenos for the rest of the day.

The lobby for the visiting xenos was straight from any proper human government office. A series of benches covered in fabric in tones of orange and brown, cheap tile carpet in dark brown, and the required “take a number” dispenser by the door. There were 10 of us working the complaints department today and the system informed me there were already 35 numbers pulled.

I flipped my sign on and the system informed me that I would be serving xeno with ticket number 87. Because like every government number dispenser it never resets to 1 in the morning.

“Number 87!” I called out.

“Yes! I have a problem!” a shrill voice called out and I was approached by a small bipedal being with four arms and a head that reminded me of a praying mantis.

“How can I be of assistance?” I asked politely.

“I ordered a set of standard bolts from your human megacorp Boltco, and they sent me this junk,” they exclaimed with clear frustration. The being pulled a bolt out of the box in their lower arms and slapped it against the glass to give me a clear view of it. It looked like… a bolt. “The size and threads are all wrong!”

“I see. Do you have the listing for the items you purchased?” I inquired with a polite smile.

I looked at the GalNet listing from Boltco, and it proudly declared “Standard bolt variety pack, 25000 units in 5 the most used sizes, produced to Terran 1374.2 Specifications (equivalent to Galactic VXE.37).” Of course, no actual sizes of the bolt or an explanation if the bolts were Earth standard sizes or Galactic standard size. Or metric.

“Have they made any offers to correct the situation?” I asked blandly.

“They’ve offered to refund and pay for return shipping, but that’s not the point!” the being screamed out. “Why the hell can’t you humans make normal standard bolts like the rest of the galaxy?”

And that’s how my morning at the Terran Embassy Complaints Department began.

I created a polite email to the customer service department at Boltco to ask them to update their sales listings on “standard” anything to include size and thread information to prevent further confusion while I spent the next 10 minutes smiling, nodding, apologizing, and assuring the angry little twerp we would take this matter seriously. They finally took the bolt that they had been waving around, threw it angrily into the box of offending bolts they had brought, and stormed out. Hopefully my first satisfied customer of the day.

“Number 103!” I called out and hoped the next “complaint” would be more reasonable and less inducing of a headache.

A species I had never seen before scampered up to my desk. It looked like some sort of crab centaur, but only about a foot wide and about six feet tall and with the head of a shrimp.

“These both say pickles, but these pickles aren’t like these pickles!” the sapient said, shaking a jar full of pickles in one claw and an empty one in the other. At first glance, all I could tell is that they were different brands and the full jar did not meet this individual’s satisfaction.

“I’m sorry, but I don’t know which stores stock that brand,” I responded with a smile.

“BUT I NEED TO FIND MORE PICKLES LIKE THIS!” the thing screamed out as it thrust the empty pickle jar into the glass window separating us so hard that it shattered. 

I quietly pressed the medical and security alert buttons, and did my best to engage and calm down the person. “I can see that we need to find more of these pickles!” I declared. “Can you please hold up the label on the broken jar? I need to look up in my system which local stores can order more for you, and which currently have them in stock.”

Excitedly, the creature dug through the glass and held the label up for me to read.

“Oh, that’s a great brand. You have excellent taste,” I said hoping to keep the sapient calm and reasonable until help arrived. Truthfully, I had never heard of Auntie Mae’s Garlic Dill Crunchers but it seemed best to follow the classic smile, nod, and agree methodology of awkward situation survival.

“Yes! Yes! These pickles are amazing,” was the only response as their eyes remained uncomfortably fixed staring at me. Every other xeno in the lobby was also staring at us in rapt attention, many visibly upset by what was happening but none willing to leave and risk losing their place in line.

Thankfully, help arrived a moment later. A marine entered the lobby holding a stunner, but the EMT following close behind him casually put his hand on the weapon to lower it. He then proceeded to walk over to the agitated being at my station.

“Hello, my friend!” the EMT called out and the crab centaur whipped around to stare at him. “I am so excited to meet someone with a love of pickles. I love them, too!”

“Yes! Pickles are good. Pickles are love,” the xeno responded with both exhilaration and extreme agitation.

“I actually have some special pickles in the back. Would you like to try some while that lovely lady looks up where you can buy more pickles?” he asked.

“Special pickles? YES!” the being exclaimed as it seemed to start shaking up and down in excitement.

“If you don’t mind, I’d like to hook you up to a medbot when we go into the back,” he said and the centaur thing stiffened for a moment until the EMT continued. “I’d like to be able to measure which pickles make you the happiest so we can get you the best pickles.”

“Oh, yes! Scientific proof of the best pickles for me! Let’s go!” the crab centaur called out and eagerly followed the EMT who was doing his best to describe every type of pickle he could think of from gherkins to half sour, spicy, and everything in between. They left with surprising calm given the earlier outburst. The marine followed them a few steps behind with the stunner still in hand and kept a wary eye on the crab centaur. And with that, as quickly as the incident started, it was over and people returned to their business of being twerps with axes to grind with humanity.

I took a break as a custodian came in to clean up the broken glass and mess at my station, unsure what the heck had just happened and why the crab centaur had such a thing for pickles.

I would later learn that the difference between the pickle jars is that the first jar was a lacto-fermented pickle direct from Earth made in an old school salt brine, while the second jar was your standard and much more common vinegar pickle. The crab centaur person was a Ja’vikian and they have a stomach that is very sensitive to Terran bacteria. Bacteria in lacto-fermented products produces an immense pleasure reaction in their kind, making certain products such as those pickles an unexpected form of crack cocaine for them. As a result, pickles, kimchi, yogurt, and any product made using lacto-fermentation or related bacteria are all now listed as galactic narcotics and require controlled substance licenses to distribute outside Terran space. 

After ten minutes in the hall to take some deep breaths and clear my mind, I returned to my duty station and steeled myself for the next “customer”.

“Number 114!” I called out.

“Yes! A human gave my pod mate methane poisoning, causing him to crash into another shuttle,” a Voraxian declared. “And now the insurance company won’t pay!”

I blinked in surprise.

“Methane poisoning?” I blurted out in shock. I didn’t like the direction this was going, and hoped it was some sort of strange industrial accident.

“Exactly so!” she continued as I now noticed the Voraxian had a deep green stripe on their shell indicating female. “We hired a human to act as co-pilot, and he never disclosed that your species digestive system emits methane. While flying, the human emitted gas unexpectedly which gave my pod mate methane poisoning, causing them to crash the shuttle into a neighboring vessel. The insurance company for your human pilot is refusing to pay for obvious damages resulting from your human failing to declare they are a walking biological hazard!”

It was clear something about the situation was off, so I did a quick search in the GalNet database for information about Voraxians and methane. Strangely enough, it is known that methane can be a heavy intoxicant for them but none of the sites clarified the amounts.

“Please give me a moment to query our medical staff,” I told the agitated sapient. “I see a note in our system that your species is sensitive to methane and I would like to get further information so I can better understand what happened.”

The Voraxian fluttered her wings, which I knew was their equivalent of an annoyed huff. “Fine, but please be quick about it.”

I sent a query to the medical team with the subject line, “YES. This is serious. Please respond appropriately.” A few minutes later, I got a message back from Dr. Ben Sharp, head of our medical team.

It was an audio file, so I pressed play to listen through my headset.

“In my professional opinion, to reach sufficient levels of toxicity for the indicated species in an enclosed cockpit, the fart would need to be this long,” Doctor Sharp’s voice said. And then I heard a looped fart sound that just wouldn’t stop. Looking at the playback bar, I noticed the audio file was over 20 minutes long.

“What is it with farts that turns adult men into little boys?” I grumbled under my breath.

“Excuse me? Did you say something?” the Voraxian asked in an unnecessarily haughty tone.

“My apologies! I indeed understand the importance of this problem,” I responded in the most serious tone I could muster. “Would you like to make a formal statement on this matter? I am happy to record an account which may be used in legal proceedings if you would like.”

“Well, then,” the Voraxian responded with another huff of her wings. “I suppose that’s a place to start.”

Internally I smiled as I read the woman the formal legal warnings for making a statement, including perjury and all the good stuff in the fine print. The lobby was full and too many of the xenos I spotted looked like the grumpy sorts, and this looked like it could become a 2 for 1 opportunity.

At the embassy complaints desk, we strive to provide the best possible solution for our customers! I think it only fair to go the extra mile for this particular Voraxian and ensure the statement would be delivered to the appropriate insurance adjuster. She seemed to need an introduction to how our insurance companies handle insurance fraud. And I needed to avoid as many of the other complainers as possible by keeping the statement process as long as possible.

Along with sending the audio file from Dr Sharp, I felt compelled to ask all the most pertinent questions to assist the insurance company.

“When you hired the human, were dietary requirements discussed? Did they express a liking for beans or cabbage?” I asked the Voraxian who suddenly seemed excited I was taking such a keen interest in the matter.

45 minutes later I had a complete statement from the Voraxian, including an admission the human co-pilot was wearing a void suit as required by galactic flight regulations. A void suit which would have contained and processed anything expelled out the back end, including solids, liquids, and gasses. I was almost sorry to see her go as she thanked me for taking the matter seriously. The insurance company would not be kind.

The rest of the day went far more as expected in the complaints department. Mostly nonsense or simple misunderstandings, and the vast majority of issues made you want to beat your head against a wall or take a shot of vodka to dull the pain. And yet, we had to remain polite and professional representatives of humanity. As the new kids on the block, we needed to make a good impression on our new galactic neighbors and take every concern seriously.

At exactly 5:00pm, we all closed down our windows in unison and marched back to the break room for the daily post-complaints gathering and comparing notes. Today’s libation was a strawberry daiquiri with the usual spread of chips and dips, although some wiseass had also put out a plate of pickles. Between pickle centaur and the methane complaint, I had the most ridiculous customers of the day yet my coworkers had a few good stories to share.

Jane interviewed a Py’rapt’ch who had been “assaulted” by human children. Short, bright colored, covered in fur, and with a shocking resemblance to bipedal dinosaurs, this sentient race had an attraction factor for humans of all ages that was unreal. Usually, the conversation involves a lot of apologizing, explaining the connection between humans and all things fuzzy, and offering counseling services to help recover from the experience. Instead, this person wasn’t seeking an apology or to register a complaint - they were asking where to go to find humans and get more free massages. 

The most fun for Gerald today was the Shelarin who ordered a pie that caused some major digestive issues. After having sampled an apple pie, they ordered a different one from another vendor - a shepard’s pie. As their kind is largely vegetarian, the meat filled pie didn’t agree with them. It turned into the best sort of “complaint” - a xeno who had a tough experience with humanity, but wasn’t angry and just wanted more information and an explanation.

He was able to have a nearly 30 minute conversation with them about the types of pies and the extreme varieties of fillings from savory to sweet. The Shelarin left excited to explore more human pies and understood what to ask for and avoid for their dietary needs, but seemed most excited to also learn there were pie adjacent foods like peach cobbler and they planned to return another day for more suggestions on foods to explore.

When he finished his story, more than a few of us suffered from rumbling stomachs and dreams of pie. In my case, pecan. With whipped cream.

I was a little sad to learn I had just missed that Shelarin who was number 151 on the day, and I had taken care of number 152 - a Zikarnian who wanted to complain about humans trying to make small talk while in elevators. Because evidently making polite conversation is deeply offensive and humans need to stop doing it.

Snacks gone, a surprising number of pickles missing, and daiquiris consumed, we said our goodbyes. It would be at least another two weeks before I’d be back at the complaint desk, and I looked forward to returning to regular duties meeting new races and trying to help chart humanity’s path in the stars.

In the meantime, after a tough day at work I needed three things. A beer, something greasy to eat, and a slice of pie. And I knew exactly which bar offered all three. I was off to That Human Bar.

Mmm... pickles. Dill with extra garlic, please!

Fresh from her postpartum confinement, Amelia Austin took her newborn daughter to the Social Security Administration to register her Social Security Number.



“Hello, I’d like to register the name Finn Robinson for my baby.”



The clerk typed for a moment, then frowned deeper and deeper. “That can’t be right. There’s already a child named Finn Robinson listed under Edmond Robinson’s household registry.”



Amelia froze, thinking she’d misheard. “That’s impossible. Our daughter was only born a month ago!”



Before the words had fully left her mouth, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She unlocked the screen to see a message from Edmond’s assistant, Blanche Flores.



Attached was a photo—Edmond’s left arm wrapped around Blanche’s waist, his right cradling a boy who looked about five or six. The three of them were standing outside a kindergarten, smiling like the picture of domestic bliss.



Pinned to the boy’s chest was a school ID tag. “Finn Robinson,” it read, clear as day.



A message followed right after:



\[Miss Austin, how does it feel to be the other woman? You’ll spend the rest of your life living in the shadow of the real wife—me.\]



It felt like a steel vise had clamped around her heart. Amelia’s fingertips trembled as she spoke to the officer.



“Could you… check Edmond Robinson’s marriage record for me?”



The printer spat out a page. Though light, it landed in her hand with the crushing weight of a sledgehammer. In the “spouse” column next to Edmond’s name, it read: Blanche Flores. The marriage had been registered seven years ago.



“Ma’am, would you still like to proceed with your daughter’s registration?” the clerk asked. His voice felt like it came from miles away.



Amelia looked down at her baby, peacefully asleep in her arms, and forced a bitter smile.



“Register her under my name,” she said softly. “And… change her name, too.”



Amelia walked out of the station on legs that felt like jelly. Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Edmond.



\[Hey babe, still stuck in meetings. I’ll be home later to spend time with you and the baby.\]



“Babe.” She almost laughed.



He’d called her that every day of their marriage. He never forgot to check in when leaving for work or give her a hug when coming home. Every little act of tenderness, once so cherished, now felt like barbed wire.



Sliding into the driver’s seat, her hands shook so badly she couldn’t get the key into the ignition.



She’d always known how the world of the wealthy worked—most high-society couples played by their own rules. But Edmond had been the exception.



Once, at an event, when a young lady of note had insulted her in front of everyone, Edmond bankrupted her entire family the very next day and forced them to leave the city. He remembered her casually admiring a limited-edition boutique piece. That same night, he’d flown halfway across the globe to get it, just to make her smile.



But what haunted her most was the time of a hospital mix-up during a routine checkup. The nurse had handed him a report claiming she had late-stage kidney failure.



Edmond’s face had gone white. He grabbed the doctor’s coat and shouted like a madman:



“Take mine! Take both my kidneys! If she dies, I’m going with her!”



It turned out to be a mistake. And that cold, ruthless businessman had sat in the hallway, sobbing like a child:



“Thank God, Amy. You’re okay. That’s all that matters…”



People warned her: the more powerful Edmond became, the more temptations would surround him. But he’d always treated her so well, so earnestly, that doubt never had a place in her heart.



So why Blanche?



Edmond used to look down on her more than anyone. Blanche had been the Austins’ maid. One day, she brought Edmond coffee while wearing a low-cut dress.



He shattered the cup on the spot and barked:



“Don’t play cheap tricks in front of me. Don’t bother coming back tomorrow.”



Then he pulled Amelia into his arms, eyes burning with intensity.



“Amy, you’re the only one I want. I won’t tolerate filth like her around you.”



Blanche had crumpled to her knees, sobbing and begging for mercy.



“I only love Amelia. I don’t entertain garbage. Don’t ever show your face to me again.”



She’d packed up and left that same day.



A few months later, Edmond hired her back as his personal assistant. He told Amelia:



“She lost her job, and her family was going to marry her off to some old creep. She started threatening suicide. I’d rather keep her under my watch than risk her stirring up trouble.”



Amelia had believed him. Never would she have guessed that the two of them had been sneaking around under her nose for six whole years—and had a child together.



Clenching her jaw against the sting behind her eyes, Amelia called a private investigator.



Thirty minutes later, a video came in with a GPS pin. She drove straight to the location.



Edmond wasn’t in a meeting. He’d just come from Finn’s kindergarten parent-teacher conference.



Hand in hand with Blanche, their son in his arms, the three of them crossed the street like a picture-perfect family. The soft smile on Edmond’s face was more genuine than any family photo they’d ever taken—and it sliced through her like glass.



Amelia tailed them to a gated suburban villa.



She watched Edmond get out of the car first, lifting a huge box of toys from the trunk. The boy squealed in delight and ran off with the loot. Blanche leaned into Edmond, teasing, “You spoil him too much.”



“He’s my son. Who else should I spoil?” Edmond grinned and kissed her on the lips. “He won the most gold stars today. Made me proud.”



Blanche’s eyes welled up. “Thank you, Ed, for enrolling him in the best private school. I never thought…”



She hesitated, voice trembling. “When I got pregnant, it was an accident. I never planned to intrude. I only wanted to watch from afar. We were never going to ruin things for you and Amelia—”



“Stop it.” Edmond cupped her cheek, voice firm but low.



“She’ll never know. Besides, you are the one on my marriage license. Of course I’ll take care of you and Finn. You’re my family.”



Blanche finally smiled through her tears. Edmond leaned closer and murmured something in her ear that made her blush bright red. Then he swept her into his arms and carried her inside.



Amelia sat frozen in her car, feeling like her heart had been sawed open with a dull blade. She barely remembered how she drove back home.



That night, Edmond returned as usual. As soon as he stepped inside, he opened his arms for a hug.



“Babe, did you wait long? Tired from taking care of the baby today?”



Amelia quietly shifted to the side. “About our daughter’s registration…”



“I’ll handle that later,” he cut her off sharply. Then, softening his tone: “Those procedures are a nightmare. You just got through recovery—leave it to me, okay?”



She nodded, lashes lowered. She didn’t tell him their daughter was already registered under her name.



She also didn’t mention the call she made on the way home.



To Edmond’s most hated rival. Holding her phone steady, her voice calm but resolute, she said:



“I’m still single. If you’re still willing—seven days from now, I’ll marry you.”



Chapter 2

Edmond Robinson let out a long sigh of relief, leaning into Amelia like a wronged child.



“Ever since you finished postpartum recovery, we haven’t really been… intimate. I thought maybe tonight we could—”



Before Amelia could even respond, a wave of nausea hit her, just as Edmond’s phone rang. He shot her a guilty glance and turned away to answer it. After hanging up, his tone turned suddenly urgent.



“Babe, something came up at the office. I’ve got to head out—urgent meeting.”



He threw on a coat and left in a rush. A cold, uneasy feeling crept into Amelia’s chest. She quickly grabbed her keys and followed behind.



She tailed his car to that secluded villa again.



A few minutes later, Blanche Flores slid into the front passenger seat, swaying her hips like she owned the place. The car began rocking almost instantly—the activity inside needing no explanation.



Amelia pulled up the spyware on her phone.



How ironic. The hidden mic had been installed back when she feared Edmond might be in danger at social events. Now, it served as the perfect tool to catch a cheater.



“Good thing you faked that stomach ache and dragged me out, or I’d still be playing house at home,” Edmond’s voice rasped, thick with breathless exertion.



“You’ve kept yourself in great shape,” he panted. “Amelia’s belly is covered in stretch marks now. Just looking at her makes me sick.”



Blanche giggled, voice sugary sweet. “Then stay here tonight. Don’t go back.”



Whatever they were doing clearly wasn’t enough—soon, Edmond carried Blanche into the villa.



Amelia sat in her car all night, numb. The man who once swore he loved her more than life itself… How had he become this?



By morning, she’d put on her usual calm facade. Edmond returned just as the sun came up, hair still damp—he’d clearly showered.



“Get dressed, babe. I’m taking you to an auction today. There’s some aesthetic pieces I think you’ll love.”



He leaned in and kissed her forehead, his voice tender, as if nothing were amiss.



Amelia hesitated but went along. At the auction house, Blanche suddenly appeared in a revealing red slit dress, her pale legs on full display.



“Mr. Robinson, I’ll carry your coat for you,” she purred.



Edmond recoiled instantly, stepping aside like she was toxic. His voice was like ice.



“I’m here with my wife. What are you doing here?”



All eyes turned toward them. Blanche bit her lip and looked at Amelia, pretending to be hurt. “But surely you need someone to assist you—”



Everyone in the room knew how much Edmond adored Amelia. Their wedding had made headlines across the city—every elite in town had attended.



Whispers swirled around them.



Edmond tightened his grip around Amelia’s waist and frowned. “Ms. Flores, this isn’t your place. Go back to the office.”



Under the weight of everyone’s judgmental stares, Blanche burst into tears and fled. Edmond gently kissed Amelia’s forehead again and guided her to their seats.



But she could feel the tension in him. His restlessness was palpable—his eyes flicked around, and his leg bounced under the table.



Item after item came up for bid, and he barely noticed.



Then the auctioneer announced a rare gemstone: The Heart of Radiance. Edmond raised his paddle without hesitation, bidding the max.



Then he stood and whispered to Amelia, “I’m going to the restroom. If you like anything, just bid.”



Gasps and murmurs followed.



“Mr. Robinson just bid sky-high!”



“He really does spoil his wife…”



“Well, she is a daughter of the Austin family. She wouldn’t settle for anything ordinary.”



Amelia wasn’t listening. The moment he left, she slipped away, heading toward the restrooms. Just as she reached the women’s restroom, she heard unmistakable sounds coming from one of the stalls.



“You little minx, what were you thinking wearing that?” Edmond’s voice, breathless.



“You’re the one who got mad first,” Blanche whined seductively. “Didn’t seem to matter when you were dragging me in here earlier.”



Edmond sighed. “Be reasonable. She’s still my wife in the public eye. Everyone here knows the Austins—we have to keep up appearances.”



Blanche whimpered, her voice trembling. “But I’m your real wife, Ed. When do I get to stand beside you in the open?”



“Stop pushing,” Edmond snapped, tone sharp. “We agreed—our marriage stays private. Don’t cross that line.”



Then he softened again.



“That gem I just bought—it’s yours. A peace offering.”



“I want a wedding,” Blanche demanded, her voice shaking. “One even bigger than Amelia’s.”



The rest was drowned out by the sound of fervent, desperate kisses.



Amelia stumbled away from the door, bile rising in her throat. She ran out of the auction hall, clutching the wall for support as she dry-heaved.



So this was the real Edmond Robinson.



In public, he lavished her with honor and titles. In private, he poured all his love into Blanche and their son.



The marriage license, the glamorous wedding—it was all a performance. She had been the fool on stage.



She closed her eyes and took a shaky breath.



“Just six more days. Endure six more days and it’ll all be over.”



Grabbing her phone, she dialed her assistant.



“Start compiling all my shares and projects within Robinson Group. I need transfer contracts drawn up immediately.”



But the reply on the other end made her blood freeze.



“Ms. Austin… the Voyager Project—the one you’ve been leading? It was reassigned to Ms. Flores last month.”



Chapter 3

The Voyager Project—a smart bionic limb development program—had been her father’s most treasured initiative before he passed. As a lifelong philanthropist, he'd poured his heart and soul into making it a reality—determined to create affordable, high-quality prosthetics that could improve the lives of the disabled.



Even during her pregnancy, Amelia Austin had stayed involved, pushing herself to oversee progress until just before delivery. Only after seeing it stabilize did she finally let herself rest. By the time she arrived at the company, her assistant was practically drenched in sweat.



“Ms. Austin, things are a mess. Mr. Robinson’s handed everything over to Ms. Flores—we don’t have any insight into what’s going on.”



Amelia’s expression stayed calm. “It’s fine. Take me to the executive office; I know Edmond’s computer password.”



A few minutes later, Blanche Flores rushed in and blocked her path.



“Mrs. Robinson, stop right there.” Her lips were swollen, love bites fresh on her neck, her face radiating smugness.



“You can’t go in without Mr. Robinson’s permission.”



Amelia’s face went cold. “Step aside. I worked on that project myself. I have every right to review it.”



“You’ve been out on maternity leave and haven’t touched this project in months. And now you want to waltz back in and steal someone else’s work? Not happening.”



Unable to stop her physically, Blanche resorted to shouting slurs out of frustration.



Just then, Edmond arrived, clearly flustered. “Why’d you leave without me? Couldn’t you wait?”



Amelia let out a laugh—Right, like you weren’t too busy playing house with Blanche to walk out with me. She shoved a report into his hands.



“Edmond, take a look at these numbers. The prosthetic materials we approved were all high-grade imports. Now? It’s all swapped out for substandard junk.”



“Who authorized this change in supplier? Who’s skimming money off the top?”



Blanche had clearly cut corners, replacing components with cheap alternatives and pocketing the difference. Edmond’s brows furrowed as he scanned the data. Even he seemed rattled.



Blanche turned ashen. “It—it wasn’t Edmond’s fault. I’m sorry, Mrs. Robinson. I just wanted to make some extra money for my son…”



“If you want to blame someone, blame me alone.”



She burst into delicate tears, looking every bit the pitiful mother—enough to make Edmond’s eyes flood with sympathy.



Amelia let out a cold, sharp laugh. “Your apology means nothing. What you did borders on criminal. I’m calling the police.”



Before she could move, a tiny figure came charging toward her and slammed into her side.



“You’re a bad witch! Stop bullying my mommy! Daddy, beat her up!”



The boy’s piercing voice rang through the office. It was Finn Robinson.



The blow made Amelia stumble with a pained gasp, her face going stark white. The employees around them all fell silent, faces stunned.



Edmond rushed to her side. “Amelia, are you okay?”



Blanche hurriedly pulled Finn back and scolded him—on the surface.



“Finn! That was so rude. Say sorry to the lady, now.”



Then she turned to Amelia. “Mrs. Robinson, if you’re upset, take it out on me. He’s just a child.”



But her eyes gleamed with triumph. Before Amelia could speak, Edmond cut in first.



“Don’t be hard on him. He’s just a kid—he doesn’t know better.” He turned to Blanche. “Take Finn home. I’ll explain things to Amelia.”



Amelia stared at Edmond, eyes locked on his.



“Explain what, exactly? That your son just called me a bad witch? Or maybe… why he calls you Dad?”



She didn’t wait for an answer. Done with their shameless charade, she turned on her heel and walked straight toward the exit.



Edmond chased after her. “Amelia, come on. He’s just six years old. Why get worked up over a child?”



Her fists clenched at her sides.



“Six years old and already this vile? That’s not the child’s fault. That’s bad parenting. Why shouldn’t I get worked up? Unless—he’s yours?”



Edmond’s face twisted, and he snapped, “Amelia, what the hell are you saying? Of course not! I only have one child—our daughter!”



Even now, he was still lying. Amelia let out a bitter laugh, looked up at him, and asked calmly:



“Then tell me—what’s our daughter’s name? You haven’t… even bothered to name her yet, have you?”



Chapter 4

Edmond fell silent.



Finn. That had been the name he once chose for their child.



Amelia had seen it written in his notes—it didn’t matter if the baby was a boy or a girl. He’d penned it himself, a wish for their child to grow up with strength and pride.



And now, that name belonged to Blanche’s son.



“My daughter’s name,” Amelia said quietly, “is April.”



Edmond’s Adam’s apple bobbed. The tension in his eyes softened, and he slipped back into his familiar gentle tone.



“April… That’s beautiful. Like a spring breeze. She’ll always shine by your side.”



He reached out, trying to brush her hair. “Babe, I’m heading out of town for a few days. Once I’m back, we can—”



“Work comes first,” Amelia interrupted coldly, walking away without another glance.



Back home, after rocking April to sleep, a notification popped up on her phone—Blanche had just updated her social feed.



The photo showed three hands clasped together. In the center was Finn’s chubby fist clutching a car key. A five-million-dollar luxury car… handed to a bastard child as a toy.



Meanwhile, she’d reminded Edmond three times last week to pick up imported diapers for their daughter—and he’d forgotten every time.



Amelia let out a bitter laugh, saved the post, and stored it neatly into a growing folder labeled Evidence.



April smacked her lips in her sleep, her lashes casting little fans of shadow under the nursery light. Amelia bent down and kissed her baby’s soft cheek.



“Don’t worry, sweetheart,” she whispered. “Mommy will protect you.”



The next day, after organizing her assets and shareholdings, Amelia booked a flight to Oakland scheduled three days later.



Ever since he noticed her starting to pull away, Edmond had been flooding her phone with messages:



\[Long day with clients today—tough crowd, but I nailed it.\]



\[You’re working so hard, babe. I found the best pastries in South City—next time, I’m taking you with me.\]



What he didn’t know was that every cent of those secretly rerouted project bonuses into Blanche’s account had already been tracked and meticulously documented in her inbox.



What he really didn’t know was that while he paraded himself as the picture-perfect husband, Blanche was busy posting cash-stuffed lingerie drawers and kiss-bruised skin on her social feed.



Amelia looked at her phone and let out a soft, mocking laugh. There had been a time when Edmond had treated her that way—like she was the only thing that mattered.



They were the envy of everyone, childhood sweethearts who grew up beneath the same old banyan tree. He once blushed and vowed, “I’ll marry no one but you.”



In college, he’d quietly driven off every guy who so much as looked at her—territorial like a wolf guarding its prey. When she had her appendix out, he stayed by her hospital bed for three days and nights without sleeping.



The first money he ever earned, he wired straight into her account, writing: “For my little princess.”



Then suddenly—sharp, panicked cries tore through the baby monitor. The nanny burst out of the nursery, hands trembling, fingers smeared with red.



“Ma’am! The baby’s leg—there’s a deep cut, it won’t stop bleeding!”



Amelia’s heart stopped cold. She sprinted inside and scooped April into her arms. Her daughter’s crying had weakened, her tiny leg slick with blood.



Amelia flew to the hospital like a madwoman. After a frantic round of tests, the doctor returned with the report.



“It’s a clotting disorder. Her hemoglobin is dangerously low. She needs a transfusion immediately.”



Amelia’s lips trembled. “Take mine! I’m her mother—use mine!”



The doctor shook his head. “Parents can’t always donate directly. And your daughter is RH-negative. We need to check our blood bank first.”



“Then hurry and start her on coagulants!” she nearly screamed.



Even after the meds were administered, the bleeding wouldn’t stop. Amelia clutched her daughter as her face paled further, tears streaming like broken beads.



Minutes later, a nurse rushed in, her expression heavy with pity.



“Ms. Austin… the RH-negative blood we had in storage—it’s been transferred out.”



Amelia jerked her head up, eyes burning in rage. “You said you had it. What do you mean transferred?”



The nurse bit her lip, lowering her voice.



“We’re a private hospital. Mr. Robinson’s son needed an emergency transfusion earlier. The chairman ordered all the RH-negative stock be sent to the VIP suite upstairs.”



It hit her like a thunderclap. The last of Amelia’s composure shattered.



She grabbed her phone, ready to confront Edmond—only to see a fresh post from Blanche.



\[Oh dear, scraped your knee again? Luckily you’ve got Daddy—the best one in the world. Look how fast he pulled strings to get the rarest blood in the city just for you\~\]



Amelia saw red. She gently passed April into the nurse’s arms and turned on her heel, storming toward the top-floor VIP wing.



When she kicked open the suite door, Blanche was lounging beside the bed, playing video games with Finn. The boy’s “injury” was barely a scrape—so minor even a band-aid was overkill.



The sight before her was like a dagger made of ice, plunged straight into Amelia’s chest.



That radiant, disgusting picture of a “happy family” burned into her retinas, and the fury in her chest surged like wildfire.



She couldn’t hold it in anymore. She screamed—



“Give the blood to my daughter!”",1,1755022064.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I’m in Dublin, fed up with Virgin Media’s bills that could fund a Galway getaway, and I’m chasing the *best IPTV provider Ireland* for my telly fix.[ IPTVsoso.net](https://iptvsoso.net) hooked me with a €12 (\~$12)/month plan, 15,000+ channels, 60,000+ movies/shows, and 4K streaming, plus a 12-hour trial. Anyone in Ireland, UK, or USA using this? Let’s unpack it like a pint of Guinness at the pub!

I tested their app on my Smart TV, easier than pulling a perfect pint. The channel list was bigger than Croke Park: RTÉ for GAA, Sky Sports for Premier League, and NBC for NFL, mostly in 4K so vivid I felt in the stands. The VOD library had films like *Barbie* and series like *Derry Girls*. At €12/month, it’s cheaper than a Dublin coffee, and WhatsApp support was faster than a hurling sliotar. It’s multi-device friendly, from Fire Stick to phone, great for Cork or New York. I used ExpressVPN, as they suggest, for privacy, since IPTV’s legally dodgy: Ireland’s copyright laws, UK’s Digital Economy Act, and USA’s FCC can mean fines. IPTVsoso.net’s new, with low trust scores, making me question reliability.

The 12-hour trial was class, with channels like TG4 stable, though I hit minor lag during a rugby match. Compared to VocoTV (16,000+ channels), IPTVsoso’s more affordable but less reviewed. I tested on my tablet during a commute, and it held up. Has anyone subscribed long-term? Are RTÉ or ESPN reliable? Any buffering during All-Ireland or Six Nations?

1mog3v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/motherinlawsfromhell/comments/1mog3v0/birthday_blues/,Birthday blues,"So I’ve been low contact for about 2.5 years and no contact for the last 8 months with my in-laws ever since my daughter’s birthday last December. I’ve posted about MIL previously and her behaviour with birthdays highlights:

1 being rude to me, my family or the staff when we went out for dinners. 

2 throwing a tantrum and refusing to attend both children’s birthdays 2 years previous as we were only going out to their birthday dinners just the 4 of us and in laws or my parents weren’t invited due to previous behaviours in point 1

3 I stupidly still invited them to join us for cake and coffee last year rather than making the full NC decision after their behaviour in point 2 thinking they could at least see the kids on their birthdays last year only to be fully ignored in my own house in front of my kids. 

So I’ve been no contact since ignored messages and just full on frosted them out. Hubby wasn’t happy at the beginning but has since came round and understood my choice. I haven’t forced him to cut their ties with the kids but as it was me who organised/pushed for him/them to have a regular relationship with them (I was clearly mad!!) they maybe only see him with the kids (never on their own) about once a month. 

Now the problem I have is on this latest monthly visit they asked my son who is about to be 13 will they be getting an invite to his birthday dinner this year while their dad was at the toilet. A boundary that has been put in place very clearly for the last several years is that it is only ever the 4 of us that now go out for a special dinner on the kids birthday. When my hubby came back in they denied asking him when he asked his dad and acted like they had no clue on what my son was talking about. I’m raging that they seem to think it’s acceptable to ask him and put him on the spot. Previous to me being NC I would always put a group text out to both sets of parents and arrange clear times when they were welcome to come for coffee cake on the day and when we would be leaving for dinner always stating just us 4 to get the point across. This year I wasn’t planning on making a chat as I haven’t spoken to them in so long and have told my parents they can see my son on the lead up to it as we plan on just celebrating the day as a 4 after last years ignorance. My question after rambling on (sorry!) is do I break non contact as such and do the usual group text making it clear no visits on the day and that both sets will get a chance to see him before/after the birthday and again hubby and kids will do that visit alone as I certainly don’t plan on welcoming in my house again. Or do I continue NC and just let my hubby deal with any questions about it? I only found out about them questioning my son today and from the kids so not had a chance to speak to hubby yet but I’m so annoyed that it’s been years and they still don’t get that we want alone time to celebrate my kids special days without them breathing down our necks and behaving badly!! Sorry for rant but my gosh why do in laws act so strangely at times and refuse to open their eyes to boundaries or consequences  of their behaviours!!!

1. Without a Condom
“Seriously?” I ask them with a surprised Pikachu face. 

“Yes.” My dad nods as he walks away with the plate of chopped apples.

“I don’t even get pocket money or monthly allowances like other kids.” I express my bad luck as I follow him to the kitchen, where my mother is baking an apple pie for us.

“You are living here for free. You never pay for the food you eat, Wi-Fi you use, electricity, and all the luxury we have provided you. I am even paying your college fees. Do you know how high it is?”

*Geezz.. He didn’t have to tell me I am broke.* 

“Emara, your father is right. You are 21 years old. No more a child.” My mother reveals the harsh reality to me that I didn’t want to hear.

“But I thought you didn’t want us to work and focus on our studies completely.” *This is hypocrisy!*

“Yes. But now you have grown up. You want money for your project? Go earn it like other kids.” My dad tells me as if closing the sentence with a period.

“You should learn something from your brother. Ethan is working on his own for his project.” My mother slaps me with comparison. 

*Not again!*

I storm back to my room and slam the door behind me. I can’t believe my parents discarded me as a princess, which is my birthright!

I think of ways to earn instant money for my last semester’s project. I am too depressed to work, too poor for a loan, not too dumb for a sugar daddy and not too hot to strip. 

*I am fucked! That too without a condom.* 

Now, I have only one option left… to sell my baby. 

I pull out the draft of my book that I have been working on for the past three years. Though it completed years ago and readers loved it online, the time has finally come to publish it.

Flashes from the past flickers through my mind as I think about the people whom I wrote this book on. I shake off those traumatic feeling that send chills of horror even now.

I have lived through that phase of my life and now, I am wise enough to recognize that these dark thoughts are just a trap, an illusion created by my pretty head.

Shits happen to everyone. *Move on!*

I pull on a red silk shirt and below a black pencil skirt that I bought last week from Target, and tie my black hair in a back slick ponytail. 

I look neat like a female version of Brad Pitt.

After a two and a half hour ride to Bellevue city, I stop at Pegasus Publishing House. They are famously known for their interviews and media printing. I had mailed them for a meeting and luckily they found a liking in my book.

My knees shake with nervousness as I wait for my turn outside the editor’s cabin. I hear an aggressive debate happening behind the door, as if chaos is rumbling, and I wonder if this is the right time for me to be here.

**Bang**

Suddenly the door swings opens, hitting the wall as two anxious men and a tall woman in five inch heals and cat eye glasses walk out in panic. 

“How did this happen so suddenly? I can’t cancel this interview!” 

I instantly stand up in my flat sandals. “Good afternoon, ma’am.” And give her my best smile.

She jerks her head and looks at me with a startle. Her gaze sweeps over my hair, silky shirt and skinny skirt as if guessing the price. “You. What is your name?”

“It’s Emara Stone. We spoke over mail about my book, Alpha’s Wicked Wa-” Before I could finish, she cuts me off with the speed of a caffeinated squirrel.

“Listen. I’ll pay you 200 dollars if you will go take this interview for me. My journalist got diarrhea and she is busy shitting in her washroom. I have no one else ready here right now.” Her red lips move hastily, but my brain’s needle halts at the amount she is offering.

*Two hundred dollars for just asking questions? This looks like a deal sent by Jesus!*

“Four hundred dollars.” I push my luck after looking at her desperation. 

“Three hundred dollars and fix your hair.” She barks and points her finger at the two men, “Team up with her.” 

“And what about my book?” I ask her as she turns her heels towards her cabin in a *do-not-disturb-me* walk. 

“I will decide after the interview.” With that, she slams the door in my face. Instantly the two men stuff me into a white Honda car outside and fill me up with details. 

“This will be a quick twenty minutes interview. You will be given a recorder and a list of questions to ask within the time limit.” The one with round glasses hands me a notepad and a small black color gadget that looks like a remote of a dildo.

“Just ask the question and let him speak. Try to get him into as much as details you can and try smiling more.” He glances at my face and I instantly spread my lips for trial.

*I can smile whole day for three hundred dollars!*

“Yeah, good. Now open your hair and remember to sit straight and cross your leg. Right leg above the left one.” He instructs me, and I nod like an obedient dog.

I yank the band out of my hair and toss it away like a used condom. I shake my hair like Shaggy told to shake that booty. They freely fall to my chest and I take a deep breath as the car halts to its destination. 

*Seattle*. The city of high class people and higher buildings, working to fulfil their highest dreams. 

And me, *I am just going to fake it till I make it baby!*

I straighten my skirt as I step out of the vehicle and look up at the huge, intimidating building, which is covered in blue glasses from all the sides like a shield. 

The tall man pulls out a camera as big as my arm while the guy with glasses warns me, “Don’t look nervous. Smile.” 

And I smile nervously.

We enter the building and I spot HighBar Systems Co. written behind the pretty receptionist who greets us with a pleasant smile.

“We are here for an interview arranged by Pegasus Publications scheduled at one thirty.” The guy with glasses speaks confidently to her and I look around, absorbing the surrounding.

There are robots at the entrance for employees to tag their cards and to my right, I see an automatic machine sweeping the floors clean. It even makes a soft hum, like it’s enjoying itself. *Wow!*

*It’s like I have stepped into the future.*

“Come.” The guy with glasses instructs me to the elevator and we get to the seventeenth floor, going right to our setting.

The doors slide open and we enter into another pristine lobby. This one looks rather astonishing, like an art museum. 

Floor-to-ceiling curved glass on one side, while white marble walls grace the other. There are paintings pensiled perfectly at every ten feet, as if someone has a serious passion for symmetry and art.

“I am sorry, sir. You do not have permission to pre-record the interview or the premises.” A woman with high bun stops us. Her bun is so high and slick, I wonder how much she gets paid to look this good.

“But it was clearly mentioned that we were invited for an interview.” The tall guy lowers his camera in confusion while the guy with round glasses does the talking, smartly.

Gosh! I don’t even know their names and I came all over here to interview some *god-damn-knows-who.*

“Correct. But for a magazine interview only. If you want the televised version, you need to have a permit from HighBar’s legal team. And as per the conclave, we can only allow the interviewer, but not the camera crew.” She explains to us lucidly, like a professional psychiatrist.

The two media guys look at me and purse their lips in irritation. 

“You go. Take the interview. And make sure to get all the answers. And smile.” He whispers the last word, and I immediately plaster a wide toothy grin on my face. 

*I wonder if I have a bitch face or do I look depressed all the time?*

“And don’t forget to turn on the recorder.” He points at the little dildo remote in my hand. 

I nod at him and walk after the blond secretary with a high bun. Her hips move like a hunter’s whip left and right, and I re-think my decision of wearing heels on regular days. 

*At least for a good-ass posture.* 

Suddenly her hips stop moving and I halt in my steps too. I look up, wondering why she stopped as she opens the thick brown wooden door in front of us, that is frankly very intimidating. 

“Please.” She actions me to enter and I nod at her with a smile, whispering, “Thank you.”

I keep my hair in front of my chest and curve my lips in a pretty-friendly smile as I walk inside the cabin. But my smile instantly drops as my eyes stride to the man with green eyes, waiting for me on the executive chair.

None other than the man who warned me to never appear in front of him in this life again.

*Dakota.*

**Warning: This book contains Non-Consensual Sex Scenes.. If you are not comfortable, please do not read it!**

2. Million Dollar Face
Time freezes.

Earth stops spinning.

And my heart sinks down to hell as those mysterious green eyes look back at me and I recognise him. 

*Dakota.. A brooding beast in the form of a man.*

Slide show of my disturbing past plays in the theater of my head and suddenly my muscles contract in panic as he narrows his eyes in vex as if he recognised me.

Recognised the girl who sent him to jail for something he didn’t do. It was three years ago when I met him in an inimical situation.

He had a perfect life.

A stardom that would shake your knees and fans, that would break bones just to see him once on the stage. He was the baddest fighter in the underground. An unbeatable wildebeest, with a power of ten wolves. They called him *Alpha.*

On top of that, he had a reputation to be the next Khalifa to rule the undergrounds. And then one chaotic moment, and I sent him to the hell. Which took away everything from him. 

His pride, fame and his will.

And now he is slowly standing while watching me with those toxic green eyes that burn on my flesh. Hair pricks under my clothes and I feel my height sinking low as if my six senses, sensed danger. 

**Ahem**

I look back at the secretary who is waiting for me to step in while she still holds the door. A part of me wants to flee away from his cabin, his building, his life coz the way his gaze hardens at me, I know he is not pleased to see me here *alive*. 

“Please. Come in.” His deep voice echoes in the cabin and I shudder feeling the nostalgia. My body still remembers the spine-chilling shivers it used to get with just his voice. 

I pull my lips up in a forceful smile and shove my scared ass inside. My heart shrieks as I take every step into his cabin which feels like entering a deadly animal’s den. 

*A ferocious one.*

His cabin alone is bigger than my classroom. It is wide and spacious with a wall completely missing. Instead, a transpicuous glass covers the missing space from floor to the ceiling, giving the bewitched view of East-Seattle from here. 

And to its corner, a mahogany table is decorated with black glassy top and behind is an executive chair of black leather that shrieks of dominance, saying who ever sits here holds the maximum power in the room.

His long legs stride towards me attentively and he actions at the couch in front of him. “Please, have a seat.” My skirt stretches up a little and I try pulling it down as I sit on his L-shaped sofa that feels expensive than my kidneys. 

Dakota sits back in his chair that is higher than his head and watches me keenly. I recall the etiquettes and cross my right leg on the top of left- wait, was it left leg on the right or-no.

“Are you not comfortable sitting there?” I look up to his prudent eyes as I hear his deep intimidating voice again. 

“Do you want to sit in a chair?” He opens his suit’s button as he stands up from his executive chair. 

*That is the only chair in the room.* 

“No. No. I was just settling.” I smile shyly as if he was offering his lap than the chair. 

I just have two legs and I got confused between the right and left. *Imagine if I was an octopus.*

Focus on the interview! I warn my brain to stay on the track while I open the notepad and look for the questions I came here to interview him. 

*Dakota Black.* I never knew his last name was Black.

Just like him.. *Dark and Mysterious.*

I push a loose lock away from my eyes and press the play button on the small remote in my hand. Green light glows on the device and I keep it on the small heighted glass table in front of me. 

Still scared to look up in those eyes that sway of dominance.

It’s been three years, yet the way his green eyes glint with feral instincts didn’t change at all. In fact, currently it reaches its zenith. 

Like the Sun in the noon, right above your head. And there is nothing in the world compared to its light and heat.

But I look up, courageously. Stare into his predatory gaze and acknowledge his imperial presence in the room. 

“Mr. Black.” I nod as a cue to tell him I am ready. 

Dakota presses on the telepad screen on his desk and says, “Bring a coffee for Miss Stone.” All while keeping his eyes on me. 

My heart does a sudden thump and goes absolute silence. 

I didn’t even tell him my name and it surprises me that he still remembers it. Of course! I sent him to jail. 

*He will remember me even if he hits his head and get amnesia.* 

I gulp my fake confidence and read the first question from the notepad, “How come an undergrad major, IT aspirant could build a company that is overpowering the old timers in industrial science? What is your secret?”

And suddenly, *I want to know as well!* 

If the magazine wanted to interview him so badly, it is obvious he didn’t make his living sitting sexily behind a desk. 

“There is no secret. It’s intelligence having fun with creativity.” He starts with Einstein’s famous quote and continues, 

“Keeping up with the technology and discovering new innovations is the key element to stand out in any market. Having faith in the future execution of the company in terms of valuation is another important aspect.” He spells every word confidently, and I nod looking for another question. 

“It says you left your internship with Tesla and started your own company, which now provides machine learning and AI to Tesla. Why so much hypocrisy?” I speak and slowly look up at him.

The way his eyes darken at me, I slowly want to crawl under the table for protection. Guilt of acid bubbles up in me knowing I was the main reason he lost his dream job at Tesla. 

*And he knows that very well.* 

Suddenly, the door opens and I pull my eyes from his punishing gaze as the blondie with a high bun walks in with a cup of coffee. 

“Thank you.” I thank her for other reason and take a breath of relief. 

*I am so dead. Dead like T-rex.* 

“I believe in excellence and individualistic work, Miss Stone.” Dakota stands up, closing the button on his suit. 

No amount of Armani tailoring could soften those broad shoulders and built muscles hiding under the cloth as he walks towards me with his calculative steps. 

I gulp the frozen saliva in my throat as he sits to the adjacent side of the couch, keeping his elbow casually on the armrest saying, 

“My goal is not to just print dollars, but to make the modern AI reachable to every stream. Hence, HighBar services are not limited to Tesla, or government’s EV automobile program, but to architecture, security and safety, home appliances, and keeping more room for quotidian areas.”

It was hard to breathe being with him in the same room and now that he is sitting so close to me, my heart forgets to beat. When I crowd up the courage to look at him, he is already staring at me. 

Last time I looked into his eyes this close, they were sad and I left him broken. But today, they appear fierce, and look boldly back at me with a glint of supremacy that can be only confused with arrogance.

“When did you make your first million?” I read another question. 

His lips control the smile as he takes a deep breath as if reliving that awesome moment of his life. 

“5th May 2021, I made my first million. Actually, correct it to ‘we’. We made our first million then. I am truly blessed with an exceptional team and prodigious co-workers who are dedicated in working on a common vision to change this world with innovation..”

While he talks about his work proudly, I couldn’t help but notice how compelling his personality is. He is a perfect epitome of a passionate man who wants to change the world with his intelligence.

But other than his great mind, Dakota possesses a captivating figure. 

His black hair, as thick and lustrous as fox fur is cut short in layers with his dusky beard trimmed along to his strong jawline that gives him a manly look. 

My eyes slide to his green orbs that burn brightly as he looks at me, deadpan and I realize he stopped speaking a minute ago.

“Oh, yes. Um..” I turn away immediately, feeling embarrassed of being caught staring at his million dollar face.

But the awareness continues to spread over my skin, heating it so intensely that I know he is still looking at me. My fingers fidget through the pages and I read out any random question.

“Your honesty about not being involved in any of illegal police cases- Are your claims about your track record holds true?” 

*Only to realize it too late.*

3. Cold and Calculative
“Are your claims about your track record holds true?” I read any random question only to realize it too late. 

*Too-fucking-late!*

I regret asking him this question, just like I regret what I did to him three years ago. One wrong statement in the police station and I sent him to jail. *Accidentally.* 

It was not in my intention to take his name that day as my mind was badly preoccupied to save someone from prosecution and unknowingly my lips spelled his name to that infuriating cop in front of me. 

But I never thought my one statement would cause such a havoc in his life, that he would lose everything and the curse will stamp a degrading black spot on his name forever. And no amount of money could buy that whitener which can clear it. 

Like a horror movie, I watch his face getting hard like granite. He lifts his long finger and presses on the pause button of the recorder. Green light blinks to orange and my heart loses a beat.

“Are you *fucking* kidding with me, Emara?” Dakota inhales sharply and I watch the glint in his eyes turn dark, animalistically.

Adrenaline rushes through my bones as I hear my name in a threatening way, indicating I stepped into a danger zone. 

“I-I-no. It’s not my question-it’s written here.” Blood drains from my head and I panic breathlessly. 

He presses the button and green light blinks again as he straightens his spine. 

“I am not going to answer the baseless rumours my legal team deals with. That is not something I would waste my time on.” Dakota says in a flat emotionless voice, but his eyes say otherwise. 

His green eyes sharpen like a glass as he stares at me with an intensity that would slit through my skin in the most painful way. 

“Yeah, sorry.” I immediately shuffle through the pages, to look for a better question which will save my ass from his chainsaw cutting gaze. 

“How much trust do you have that in the near future Artificial Intelligence is going to take over the world?” I gulp nervously, avoiding the sweat building in between my breast.

Dakota leans forward and my nose hits with an earthy woodsy scent mixed with some rich cologne. He taps his two long fingers on the glass table and says in a calmer tone, 

“For an example, consider AI as Internet. Now back in 1995, there were not many people on Internet and they believed this online thing was going to be a fad.” 

The way his fingers make circles on the glass, something churns inside of my stomach. Everything about him is alluring and intimidating. Like a red danger sign that blinks of green light. 

“And now the circs of humanity is, you can live without people, but not Internet. The system has infiltrated into your life like a necessity. I believe AI would be a necessity in the future. It has been already started. Our phones, watches, computers are now designed to program with AI and machine learning. It’s like blood and veins, you can separate none from your system.”

The way he described it in a collective manner, makes me want to go take a major in this AI shit. “That’s interesting.” Every cell in my body is overly impressed and is applauding at his little tED-Talk. 

“It is.” His lips curve up arrogantly and he sits back like a boss he is. 

“Many people lack to see it’s a multi-billion dollar bonanza, but only with the use of correct technology.” He smirks at the end, hinting why his company owns the market. 

I find my spine slowly relaxing as I smile at him and read the next question. “You are an alumnus of Washington University, Science and Innovation branch. Being an orpha-” *The fuck?*

“You are an orphan?” My eyes snap at him with surprise written all over my face. As if I never really knew this man, he is like that huge iceberg in the Atlantic, and all I saw was the tip. 

Dakota’s jaw clenches as he stares me with his previous stone-cold gaze. “Yes, Miss Stone. I was left in an orphanage at the age of two. It is available in public records.” His voice stern while his fingers curl up in a fist on his thigh. 

Unknowingly I stepped on another *‘shouldn’t have touched’* nerve. “I.. didn’t know.” My voice gets soften and I feel ten times more worse than ten minutes ago, before starting this interview. 

But his expression remains stony as if all the emotions in him dried up long ago. And now what is left is a cold-calculative businessman whose only goal is to upgrade the world with technology.

“Being an orphan, how did you achieve that level of big-budget education?” I ask him, chucking away my bag of guilty feelings. 

I just want this interview to be over so I can disappear from his life. Fast and furiously.

“Scholarship and part-time jobs covered my expenses.” He says in a flat tone. 

Images of his part-time job flash in my head, which mostly contained brutal punches and bone shattering blows. People chanting his name, betting on him while he knocks the hell out of his opponents in underground fights.

Suddenly, I feel glad that we met in a professional setting. 

“What was your first job?” I ask him.

“I worked at a dog bakery.” He replies dryly and I almost gasp out loud. 

*He used to bake dogs? Well, he does look like someone who like cats.*

“Do you plan to produce your own product, other than providing services to tech giants?” I read to him fast.

“I haven’t thought of that far.” And he replies faster. 

We both want to be done with this interview.

“Which is the turning point day of your life that you owe your success to-” 

Suddenly the recorder on the glass table makes little beeping sound while its green light flicker like heartbeats. I tap the gadget like giving it chest compression, but it breathes its last beep and dies in my palm. 

The green light turns black and no further sound comes from the gone voice recorder. 

*It’s dead. Dead like Dodo.* 

I swallow hard and slowly lift my not-so-long lashes at him. Dakota stares down at me with a blank expression. As if his features are fighting a battle not to frown or roll his eyes. 

I bite my lip nervously and blink innocently at him, while he stares at me with a deadpan face.

Dakota takes a deep sigh and pulls out a pen from his chest’s pocket. I shyly take the black steel pen from his hand as if it is a condom. 

“Thank you.” And murmur sheepishly.

The pen feels pleasantly warm in between my fingers, and I know it is the warmth of his body. Something moves inside my belly like worms as my mind display images of his hard body underneath those piles of clothes. *His eight pack abs.*

“25th September 2019.”

My eyes look up at him in shock as he spells the date of that awful night of college’s annual fest event, when I met him for the last time. 

When he warned me to never come in front of his eyes, ever. And now here I am, sitting on his leather couch, in his vast cabin, and taking his interview.

“Three years ago, I met with an accident that night when I was driving back to my place. A bit angrily.” He pauses and fixes his green stare at me. 

“I broke my arm and three ribs, and I was hospitalized for two weeks under critical care. During that time of my life, many things were going inside my head. But the one on repeat was, if somehow I would have known, even seconds before that a car out of nowhere is going to crash into mine. I would have saved my few bones.”

I could feel the world slowing down around me, colours fading and replacing with melancholy as I look at his impassive gaze that holds mine like steel. 

“Since then I have been working on augmented reality, integrating it with autopilot and radar, to track the activities on the road in a 360 degree angle to avert such disasters in the future. Which I sold it to Tesla and build my company with those funds in 2020.”

It was only too late for me to figure out that he was answering to my previous question. I swallow my saliva and it took a great effort to gulp it down my clogged throat. 

“So I owe my success to that one blue moon night of my life.” And I know he is not talking about the accident. 

I open a fresh page in the notebook, black ink flows through the pen like blood oozes from a fresh cut and I write his answer with the same feeling.

Every word cuts through me with its knife of regret.

A part of me wants to hold him, hug him tightly and beg for forgiveness. But I know, no amount of my sorry will fix his broken past. *Ever*.

I look up and see him going through notifications on his apple watch. Frown decorate his forehead but that didn’t decrease his elegance. He looks equally handsome as he looks heartless.

*Someone who won’t rest until he owns the world.*

“Mr. Black, are you busy?” I ask him in a hope to end this meeting.

“No.” He instantly answers, giving me his full predatory attention. As if this interview will give him a billion dollar break, he has been waiting for. 

“Dakota Black, a high achiever, millionaire in his 20s and a hot shot bachelor who got girls drooling for him..” I almost cringe reading out to him. 

“Is your heart surrendering to settle down?” I look up at the end.

4. Inch-by-Inch
“Dakota Black, a high achiever, millionaire in his 20s and a hot shot bachelor who got girls drooling for him.. Is your heart surrendering to settle down?” 

I look up at him in *Italics* and he stares back at me in **Bold**. 

His thick, roughly trimmed eyebrow inches up in amusement and I instantly double check if I read it right. 

*Errh!* Why do they have to write such cheesy *blushing-till-my-ass* questions and not ask directly?

I hear him intake a deep breath of frustration and I find myself sinking more into his expensive couch. He looks irritated and most of all, ignited. 

“Didn’t meet any eye-catching woman yet.” He says, directly looking into my eyes. 

*It’s hard.* 

Like fighting six fully grown fire-breathing dragons. It is that hard to stare at his toxic green eyes that penetrate into me unapologetically. And like an amateur princess, I crawl my gaze to the notebook and write his answer with his elegant pen. 

*Didnt-meet-any-ass-catching-woman-ye*

“What about you?”

My head jerks up in surprise as his deadly quiet voice echoes in my ears. “What about me?” I ask him with a stupefying face. 

*What about me?* My anxiety asks as well.

Dakota looks relaxed, his one hand rests on his thigh and another on the arm of couch. His long finger trails the dark stubble of chin as he studies me with his deep stare, like I am some low-budget startup he should invest in. 

“How did you end up here?” My skin pricks as the deep sound of his voice reaches me again. Curiosity draws on his full lips, something that I would call edible.

“I was at the publication house and somehow stumbled here.” I push a loose lock behind my ear and try to pull my confident face. But I am not brave enough to compete with his beastly gaze, and out-stare him is a topic of different dimension. 

“You are into journalism? I thought you were a student of Engineering and Computer Science.” He says without any inflection. 

“Yeah. I mean no.” Something flutters in my heart and my cheeks tickle with rush of blood, knowing he still remembers my major even after three long years. *Why?* 

*Why such a good memory?*

I wet my lips. His eyes burn into me and I feel compelled to tell him the truth. 

“I wanted money for my final semester project, so I was at the Pegasus Publications to publish my book that I have been writing for some time. But their interviewer had diarrhea, so the editor asked me to take this interview and later sign me as an author so I can get my book published.”

Heat licks my skin the way his gaze peer down at me with a curiosity I have never seen before. 

“You write books?” His eyes flare momentarily in surprise. 

“What kind of?” And asks with an interest as if he will order it the next second. 

*No, no, NO!*

My heart flaps like thousand wings and I instantly look down at the little notebook on my lap for diversion. I am not sure if he is really interested or simply asking me questions to pass his leisure time. Which I think he does not have any.

“It’s not your cup of tea.” I say, biting my lip.

My heart speeds up abnormally as he leans down towards me, a bit intimidatingly. His earthy scent hits my nose again, and I clench my thighs in response as I feel his hot gaze licking my skin. 

“And what made you think, Emara?” 

I close my eyes. Chills run through me as I hear my name for the second time in his deep, threatening voice. 

“Without even knowing what I drink.” He whispers darkly and for some messed up reason, my cheeks heat up. 

I bite my lip and when I pluck up the courage to look at him, he is already watching me. His green eyes are focused on the blush of my cheeks and slowly drifts to the space under my jaw and between my neck which disappears inside my red silk shirt. 

I gulp loudly. It was the hardest gulp I did and my anxieties kick in, wondering if I sounded loud. Or worse, *aroused.* 

I shake my head to clear the thoughts of red colour and get myself back to the reality. 

“I just thought it’s not your forte. You seem like a logical man, who is into technical stuff and probably reads motivational and leadership books of famous auth-”

“Get to the point.” He speaks like a sharp order, a bit impatiently.

“You won’t like my romance novel.” I blurt out. 

*And I don’t want you to read it. Please!*

Dakota narrows his eyes and hints a smile at the corner of his lips. A smile that only a predator does, when he corners his prey. 

“Tell me.. What is your novel about?” He sits back and asks me calmly, as if taking my interview. His long index finger now trails across his lips as he waits for my answer, rather patiently this time. 

“It’s nothing interesting.” I shake my head, nervously. 

“I’ll decide that.” He replies, curtly.

My heart thrashes wildly in my chest as I lift my lashes and watch him staring at me attentively. 

Even while he is just sitting here, doing nothing, there is something dark percolating behind his eyes that just makes me more nervous. 

“It’s a fictional story of a different world, which is ruled by werewolves and their leader is a bit crazy for a girl. And he wants to have her at any cost.” 

I try to keep it short and boring. But the way his eyes glow alive, green and deep. I think I hit the wrong nerve in his head. 

“Wolves?” Hiking up one eyebrow, he shows his surprise. 

And suddenly, my memory files show me images of that heinous wolf tattoo on his back that covers up till the front of his chest and shoulder, while I saw him in the cage. 

The real reason why people called him *The Alpha.* 

I immediately look down at the notebook and ruffle through the pages with uncontrolled heartbeats. *Shit! Shit!*

“I-I believe I have covered all the questions. Only one is left.” I do not look up at him this time as I read..

“Being an epitome of rag to riches. What do you miss the most from your simple life?” I keep the paper and pen ready for his answer as he says,

“Violence.”

I look up at him. Shocked. 

Like a dramatic pause in a music. 

“I miss the underground fights I was part of. There was something deeply satisfying to hear the crunch of breaking bones, and watch their ego shatter with my every punch till nothing is left in them, other than blood and bones.”

He breathes in deeply. 

“It felt *so* good to hurt those motherfuckers, especially knowing I was the cause. That power over another person’s life, even for a minute or two. I miss that thrill. No drug or woman could ever come close to that adrenaline rush I felt in the ring.”

Shards of power flicks in his green eyes and they glow brighter and greener. Like a flowing river in the wild, uncontrolled and unmanned by the nature. 

It took everything in me to look away from his fierce passionate gaze and down to the plain notebook paper, that doesn’t allure me. 

I collect my brain which is all over his face, suit, hands, and write down his answer, word-to-word. 

Once done, I look up at him one last time. 

The way he is reading through his apple watch and simply sitting there, he sucks up all the oxygen in the room. He screams of class, lavishness, sophistication and pure power.

*Someone I should stay at least a mile away.* 

I gather my items and with great efforts stand up on my feet while he eases out of his seat easily. His fingers unconsciously close his suit’s button, as if he has done this a thousand times. 

“Thank you for your time, Mr. Black. It was nice seeing you.” I feel my height sinking to the ground as he stands next to me in his 6’ 4. He gives a respectful nod and gestures me towards the door. *The exit.* 

I can finally walk out of his claws and his almost perfect life. 

“You look different.” 

My eyes snap back to him as I hear his husky voice sliding through my skin like silk. Adrenaline pumps through my veins and my face blushes with the instant flow of blood. 

“Yeah. I don’t colour my hair now.” I tuck one of the escaped locks of my hair behind my ear as I pretend to not get intimidated by him. 

I remember I had blue hair when I met him for the first time. It’s strange how he remembers unnecessary details about me.

“Not hair. You gained weight.” He says low and deep, taking a quick glance at my body and suddenly, my self-conscious demons rises from the dark. 

“I look fat?” I ask him shockingly. My confidence sinks down to my tummy, which I thought I tucked nicely behind the black pencil skirt I am wearing. 

“You look better.” A smile hints at the corner of his lips as he says without looking at me, as if he clearly remembers me, inch by inch how I looked years ago.

When people are at the bookstore, they just want their fucking books. When they're at the coffee shop, they just want their fucking coffee. Leave it at that. 

If I were a woman, I can't imagine how annoyed, or how creeped out, I would be if I was grabbing some kale and then some fucking hotshot says something ""suave"" like ""oh hey I love kale too, where are you from, can I have your number, *let's fuck*"" (not that he actually says the last, but you know that's what he's after) when literally all I want here is the goddamn kale. Go away? 

At the very least, go look up some statistics on how couples meet, especially before online dating was a thing. They met through friends. Through family. Through work. Through school. And if it wasn't through someone you knew already, it was in a place where people ACTUALLY expect to be approached and are *okay with it*, like a bar. That is where it is actually fucking okay. But where I'm getting my wake-up juice? No. 

Seriously, tell me, if it's such great advice, then why are almost all relationships starting through the means I mentioned earlier? Why is the percentage of couples who met through ""accosted by some dumbass when I was just out buying some things but it turns out he was actually the love of my life"" just about 0% of the ways couples meet?

Oh, are you, like, that one person who actually did so successfully? Oh well that changes everything, because one anecdotal instance of a thing occurring invalidates population-wide data, amirite? 

Just leave people alone and stop giving such socially inept dating advice. Want a date? Hit up your friends, family, coworkers, and if that's a big fat no, then hit up the bar scene where it's okay to do this. But for fuck's sake, stop telling people they need to annoy grocery shoppers and the like in order to get one. ",5,1755021731.0,rant,1,1.0,False

## key Features Analysis

The ideal barnwood coffee table seamlessly blends rustic appeal with functionality.

**Authentic barnwood Material:** The defining characteristic of any barnwood coffee table is, of course, the reclaimed wood itself. Look for tables constructed from genuine reclaimed barnwood, as this guarantees the unique textures, knots, and nail holes that tell a story.The patina, or the surface quality of the wood, should be rich with character, displaying variations in color and texture developed over years of weathering. Authenticity adds immense value, turning a simple table into an heirloom piece.

**Robust Construction and Joinery:** Beyond aesthetics, structural integrity is paramount. A well-built barnwood coffee table should feature solid joinery techniques, such as mortise and tenon, dovetail, or strong screw-and-glue construction. Check for sturdy legs and a level surface. the weight of the table should be substantial, reflecting the density of the reclaimed wood. Avoid tables that feel flimsy or unstable, as they are less likely to withstand daily use.

**Protective Finish:** While the raw, unfinished look of barnwood is appealing to some, a protective finish is essential for preserving the wood and preventing stains or water damage. Look for a durable, low-VOC sealant or varnish that enhances the wood's natural beauty without creating an artificial shine. matte or satin finishes are often preferred, as they maintain the rustic character of the wood. Consider a finish that is water-resistant and easy to clean.

**Size and Dimensions:** The perfect coffee table size depends largely on the dimensions of your living room and the configuration of your seating. Measure the available space carefully, considering the distance between the table and your sofa or chairs. A general rule is that the coffee table should be approximately two-thirds the length of the sofa. The height should be relatively close to the height of your sofa cushions, allowing for comfortable reach.

**Storage Options (Optional):** Some barnwood coffee tables offer built-in storage, such as shelves, drawers, or lift-top mechanisms. These features can be incredibly useful for stowing away remote controls, magazines, or othre living room essentials. If storage is a priority,consider the size and accessibility of the storage compartments. Ensure that the storage mechanisms are smoothly operating and well-constructed.

Key features of a great barnwood coffee table include:

*   Authentic barnwood construction
*   Durable protective finish
*   Solid joinery and stable design

## Core benefits

Owning a barnwood coffee table offers more than just a piece of furniture; it provides a unique blend of style, functionality, and sustainability.

**Unique aesthetic Appeal:** The most obvious benefit is the distinctive aesthetic that a barnwood coffee table brings to a room. no two pieces of reclaimed wood are exactly alike, so each table is truly one-of-a-kind. The natural imperfections, variations in grain, and reclaimed character give the table a story and a sense of authenticity that cannot be replicated by mass-produced furniture. Owning a barnwood coffee table is owning a piece of art.

**Adds Warmth and Character:** The rustic charm of barnwood softens the formality of modern living spaces. Rather of feeling sterile or impersonal, a room with a barnwood coffee table gains a lived-in, welcoming atmosphere. the warm tones of the wood and the history it embodies create a sense of comfort and connection,making the space feel more inviting and relaxing.

**Environmentally Lasting Choice:** Choosing reclaimed barnwood is an environmentally conscious decision. By repurposing wood that would otherwise be discarded, you are reducing the demand for newly harvested timber and minimizing waste. This promotes sustainable forestry practices and conserves natural resources, making your purchase a responsible choice for the surroundings.

**Durability and Longevity:** Barnwood, having weathered years of exposure, is often incredibly durable. Reclaimed wood is typically denser and more resistant to wear and tear than newly harvested wood. A well-constructed barnwood coffee table can withstand years of use and become a cherished heirloom, passed down through generations.

**Versatile Design Integration:** While inherently rustic, a barnwood coffee table can seamlessly integrate into a variety of design styles. It can complement farmhouse, industrial, modern, or even contemporary interiors. Its neutral tones and natural textures allow it to blend harmoniously with different color palettes and furniture styles, adding a touch of organic warmth to any room.

## FAQs Section

**How do I clean and maintain a barnwood coffee table?**
Cleaning a barnwood coffee table depends on the finish applied. For most sealed barnwood surfaces, a damp cloth with mild soap is sufficient for removing spills and dirt.Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the finish. Periodically apply a furniture polish or oil specifically designed for wood to nourish the material and maintain its luster.

**Will the barnwood coffee table scratch or dent easily?**
While barnwood is typically durable, it is still susceptible to scratches and dents, especially if it has a softer finish. Protect the surface by using coasters and placemats. Avoid placing heavy or sharp objects directly on the table. Scratches and dents can often be minimized with wood filler or touch-up products, but embracing the imperfections as part of the rustic character is also a viable approach.

**What is the typical lifespan of a barnwood coffee table?**
with proper care and maintenance, a high-quality barnwood coffee table can last for decades, even generations.

Quick protocol question. The Pre-PICL instructions state “The patient is not permitted to drink for 2 hours and eat for 6 hours before the BMA and PICL procedure”. 

If the patient is to arrive at 8:30am for a 9:30am BMA, could the patient in theory have a cup of coffee 2+ hours prior at like 6:30am? 

Silly question I know but caffeine/coffee is a dealbreaker for me in terms of daily headache. Without it, I’m guaranteed a migraine which is not preferable on the day of PICL.

# 1. Without a Condom



“Seriously?” I ask them with a surprised Pikachu face. 



“Yes.” My dad nods as he walks away with the plate of chopped apples.



“I don’t even get pocket money or monthly allowances like other kids.” I express my bad luck as I follow him to the kitchen, where my mother is baking an apple pie for us.



“You are living here for free. You never pay for the food you eat, Wi-Fi you use, electricity, and all the luxury we have provided you. I am even paying your college fees. Do you know how high it is?”



\*Geezz.. He didn’t have to tell me I am broke.\* 



“Emara, your father is right. You are 21 years old. No more a child.” My mother reveals the harsh reality to me that I didn’t want to hear.



“But I thought you didn’t want us to work and focus on our studies completely.” \*This is hypocrisy!\*



“Yes. But now you have grown up. You want money for your project? Go earn it like other kids.” My dad tells me as if closing the sentence with a period.



“You should learn something from your brother. Ethan is working on his own for his project.” My mother slaps me with comparison. 



\*Not again!\*



I storm back to my room and slam the door behind me. I can’t believe my parents discarded me as a princess, which is my birthright!



I think of ways to earn instant money for my last semester’s project. I am too depressed to work, too poor for a loan, not too dumb for a sugar daddy and not too hot to strip. 



\*I am fucked! That too without a condom.\* 



Now, I have only one option left… to sell my baby. 



I pull out the draft of my book that I have been working on for the past three years. Though it completed years ago and readers loved it online, the time has finally come to publish it.



Flashes from the past flickers through my mind as I think about the people whom I wrote this book on. I shake off those traumatic feeling that send chills of horror even now.



I have lived through that phase of my life and now, I am wise enough to recognize that these dark thoughts are just a trap, an illusion created by my pretty head.



Shits happen to everyone. \*Move on!\*



I pull on a red silk shirt and below a black pencil skirt that I bought last week from Target, and tie my black hair in a back slick ponytail. 



I look neat like a female version of Brad Pitt.



After a two and a half hour ride to Bellevue city, I stop at Pegasus Publishing House. They are famously known for their interviews and media printing. I had mailed them for a meeting and luckily they found a liking in my book.



My knees shake with nervousness as I wait for my turn outside the editor’s cabin. I hear an aggressive debate happening behind the door, as if chaos is rumbling, and I wonder if this is the right time for me to be here.



\*\*Bang\*\*



Suddenly the door swings opens, hitting the wall as two anxious men and a tall woman in five inch heals and cat eye glasses walk out in panic. 



“How did this happen so suddenly? I can’t cancel this interview!” 



I instantly stand up in my flat sandals. “Good afternoon, ma’am.” And give her my best smile.



She jerks her head and looks at me with a startle. Her gaze sweeps over my hair, silky shirt and skinny skirt as if guessing the price. “You. What is your name?”



“It’s Emara Stone. We spoke over mail about my book, Alpha’s Wicked Wa-” Before I could finish, she cuts me off with the speed of a caffeinated squirrel.



“Listen. I’ll pay you 200 dollars if you will go take this interview for me. My journalist got diarrhea and she is busy shitting in her washroom. I have no one else ready here right now.” Her red lips move hastily, but my brain’s needle halts at the amount she is offering.



\*Two hundred dollars for just asking questions? This looks like a deal sent by Jesus!\*



“Four hundred dollars.” I push my luck after looking at her desperation. 



“Three hundred dollars and fix your hair.” She barks and points her finger at the two men, “Team up with her.” 



“And what about my book?” I ask her as she turns her heels towards her cabin in a \*do-not-disturb-me\* walk. 



“I will decide after the interview.” With that, she slams the door in my face. Instantly the two men stuff me into a white Honda car outside and fill me up with details. 



“This will be a quick twenty minutes interview. You will be given a recorder and a list of questions to ask within the time limit.” The one with round glasses hands me a notepad and a small black color gadget that looks like a remote of a dildo.



“Just ask the question and let him speak. Try to get him into as much as details you can and try smiling more.” He glances at my face and I instantly spread my lips for trial.



\*I can smile whole day for three hundred dollars!\*



“Yeah, good. Now open your hair and remember to sit straight and cross your leg. Right leg above the left one.” He instructs me, and I nod like an obedient dog.



I yank the band out of my hair and toss it away like a used condom. I shake my hair like Shaggy told to shake that booty. They freely fall to my chest and I take a deep breath as the car halts to its destination. 



\*Seattle\*. The city of high class people and higher buildings, working to fulfil their highest dreams. 



And me, \*I am just going to fake it till I make it baby!\*



I straighten my skirt as I step out of the vehicle and look up at the huge, intimidating building, which is covered in blue glasses from all the sides like a shield. 



The tall man pulls out a camera as big as my arm while the guy with glasses warns me, “Don’t look nervous. Smile.” 



And I smile nervously.



We enter the building and I spot HighBar Systems Co. written behind the pretty receptionist who greets us with a pleasant smile.



“We are here for an interview arranged by Pegasus Publications scheduled at one thirty.” The guy with glasses speaks confidently to her and I look around, absorbing the surrounding.



There are robots at the entrance for employees to tag their cards and to my right, I see an automatic machine sweeping the floors clean. It even makes a soft hum, like it’s enjoying itself. \*Wow!\*



\*It’s like I have stepped into the future.\*



“Come.” The guy with glasses instructs me to the elevator and we get to the seventeenth floor, going right to our setting.



The doors slide open and we enter into another pristine lobby. This one looks rather astonishing, like an art museum. 



Floor-to-ceiling curved glass on one side, while white marble walls grace the other. There are paintings pensiled perfectly at every ten feet, as if someone has a serious passion for symmetry and art.



“I am sorry, sir. You do not have permission to pre-record the interview or the premises.” A woman with high bun stops us. Her bun is so high and slick, I wonder how much she gets paid to look this good.



“But it was clearly mentioned that we were invited for an interview.” The tall guy lowers his camera in confusion while the guy with round glasses does the talking, smartly.



Gosh! I don’t even know their names and I came all over here to interview some \*god-damn-knows-who.\*



“Correct. But for a magazine interview only. If you want the televised version, you need to have a permit from HighBar’s legal team. And as per the conclave, we can only allow the interviewer, but not the camera crew.” She explains to us lucidly, like a professional psychiatrist.



The two media guys look at me and purse their lips in irritation. 



“You go. Take the interview. And make sure to get all the answers. And smile.” He whispers the last word, and I immediately plaster a wide toothy grin on my face. 



\*I wonder if I have a bitch face or do I look depressed all the time?\*



“And don’t forget to turn on the recorder.” He points at the little dildo remote in my hand. 



I nod at him and walk after the blond secretary with a high bun. Her hips move like a hunter’s whip left and right, and I re-think my decision of wearing heels on regular days. 



\*At least for a good-ass posture.\* 



Suddenly her hips stop moving and I halt in my steps too. I look up, wondering why she stopped as she opens the thick brown wooden door in front of us, that is frankly very intimidating. 



“Please.” She actions me to enter and I nod at her with a smile, whispering, “Thank you.”



I keep my hair in front of my chest and curve my lips in a pretty-friendly smile as I walk inside the cabin. But my smile instantly drops as my eyes stride to the man with green eyes, waiting for me on the executive chair.



None other than the man who warned me to never appear in front of him in this life again.



\*Dakota.\*



\*\*Warning: This book contains Non-Consensual Sex Scenes.. If you are not comfortable, please do not read it!\*\*



# 2. Million Dollar Face



Time freezes.



Earth stops spinning.



And my heart sinks down to hell as those mysterious green eyes look back at me and I recognise him. 



\*Dakota.. A brooding beast in the form of a man.\*



Slide show of my disturbing past plays in the theater of my head and suddenly my muscles contract in panic as he narrows his eyes in vex as if he recognised me.



Recognised the girl who sent him to jail for something he didn’t do. It was three years ago when I met him in an inimical situation.



He had a perfect life.



A stardom that would shake your knees and fans, that would break bones just to see him once on the stage. He was the baddest fighter in the underground. An unbeatable wildebeest, with a power of ten wolves. They called him \*Alpha.\*



On top of that, he had a reputation to be the next Khalifa to rule the undergrounds. And then one chaotic moment, and I sent him to the hell. Which took away everything from him. 



His pride, fame and his will.



And now he is slowly standing while watching me with those toxic green eyes that burn on my flesh. Hair pricks under my clothes and I feel my height sinking low as if my six senses, sensed danger. 



\*\*Ahem\*\*



I look back at the secretary who is waiting for me to step in while she still holds the door. A part of me wants to flee away from his cabin, his building, his life coz the way his gaze hardens at me, I know he is not pleased to see me here \*alive\*. 



“Please. Come in.” His deep voice echoes in the cabin and I shudder feeling the nostalgia. My body still remembers the spine-chilling shivers it used to get with just his voice. 



I pull my lips up in a forceful smile and shove my scared ass inside. My heart shrieks as I take every step into his cabin which feels like entering a deadly animal’s den. 



\*A ferocious one.\*



His cabin alone is bigger than my classroom. It is wide and spacious with a wall completely missing. Instead, a transpicuous glass covers the missing space from floor to the ceiling, giving the bewitched view of East-Seattle from here. 



And to its corner, a mahogany table is decorated with black glassy top and behind is an executive chair of black leather that shrieks of dominance, saying who ever sits here holds the maximum power in the room.



His long legs stride towards me attentively and he actions at the couch in front of him. “Please, have a seat.” My skirt stretches up a little and I try pulling it down as I sit on his L-shaped sofa that feels expensive than my kidneys. 



Dakota sits back in his chair that is higher than his head and watches me keenly. I recall the etiquettes and cross my right leg on the top of left- wait, was it left leg on the right or-no.



“Are you not comfortable sitting there?” I look up to his prudent eyes as I hear his deep intimidating voice again. 



“Do you want to sit in a chair?” He opens his suit’s button as he stands up from his executive chair. 



\*That is the only chair in the room.\* 



“No. No. I was just settling.” I smile shyly as if he was offering his lap than the chair. 



I just have two legs and I got confused between the right and left. \*Imagine if I was an octopus.\*



Focus on the interview! I warn my brain to stay on the track while I open the notepad and look for the questions I came here to interview him. 



\*Dakota Black.\* I never knew his last name was Black.



Just like him.. \*Dark and Mysterious.\*



I push a loose lock away from my eyes and press the play button on the small remote in my hand. Green light glows on the device and I keep it on the small heighted glass table in front of me. 



Still scared to look up in those eyes that sway of dominance.



It’s been three years, yet the way his green eyes glint with feral instincts didn’t change at all. In fact, currently it reaches its zenith. 



Like the Sun in the noon, right above your head. And there is nothing in the world compared to its light and heat.



But I look up, courageously. Stare into his predatory gaze and acknowledge his imperial presence in the room. 



“Mr. Black.” I nod as a cue to tell him I am ready. 



Dakota presses on the telepad screen on his desk and says, “Bring a coffee for Miss Stone.” All while keeping his eyes on me. 



My heart does a sudden thump and goes absolute silence. 



I didn’t even tell him my name and it surprises me that he still remembers it. Of course! I sent him to jail. 



\*He will remember me even if he hits his head and get amnesia.\* 



I gulp my fake confidence and read the first question from the notepad, “How come an undergrad major, IT aspirant could build a company that is overpowering the old timers in industrial science? What is your secret?”



And suddenly, \*I want to know as well!\* 



If the magazine wanted to interview him so badly, it is obvious he didn’t make his living sitting sexily behind a desk. 



“There is no secret. It’s intelligence having fun with creativity.” He starts with Einstein’s famous quote and continues, 



“Keeping up with the technology and discovering new innovations is the key element to stand out in any market. Having faith in the future execution of the company in terms of valuation is another important aspect.” He spells every word confidently, and I nod looking for another question. 



“It says you left your internship with Tesla and started your own company, which now provides machine learning and AI to Tesla. Why so much hypocrisy?” I speak and slowly look up at him.



The way his eyes darken at me, I slowly want to crawl under the table for protection. Guilt of acid bubbles up in me knowing I was the main reason he lost his dream job at Tesla. 



\*And he knows that very well.\* 



Suddenly, the door opens and I pull my eyes from his punishing gaze as the blondie with a high bun walks in with a cup of coffee. 



“Thank you.” I thank her for other reason and take a breath of relief. 



\*I am so dead. Dead like T-rex.\* 



“I believe in excellence and individualistic work, Miss Stone.” Dakota stands up, closing the button on his suit. 



No amount of Armani tailoring could soften those broad shoulders and built muscles hiding under the cloth as he walks towards me with his calculative steps. 



I gulp the frozen saliva in my throat as he sits to the adjacent side of the couch, keeping his elbow casually on the armrest saying, 



“My goal is not to just print dollars, but to make the modern AI reachable to every stream. Hence, HighBar services are not limited to Tesla, or government’s EV automobile program, but to architecture, security and safety, home appliances, and keeping more room for quotidian areas.”



It was hard to breathe being with him in the same room and now that he is sitting so close to me, my heart forgets to beat. When I crowd up the courage to look at him, he is already staring at me. 



Last time I looked into his eyes this close, they were sad and I left him broken. But today, they appear fierce, and look boldly back at me with a glint of supremacy that can be only confused with arrogance.



“When did you make your first million?” I read another question. 



His lips control the smile as he takes a deep breath as if reliving that awesome moment of his life. 



“5th May 2021, I made my first million. Actually, correct it to ‘we’. We made our first million then. I am truly blessed with an exceptional team and prodigious co-workers who are dedicated in working on a common vision to change this world with innovation..”



While he talks about his work proudly, I couldn’t help but notice how compelling his personality is. He is a perfect epitome of a passionate man who wants to change the world with his intelligence.



But other than his great mind, Dakota possesses a captivating figure. 



His black hair, as thick and lustrous as fox fur is cut short in layers with his dusky beard trimmed along to his strong jawline that gives him a manly look. 



My eyes slide to his green orbs that burn brightly as he looks at me, deadpan and I realize he stopped speaking a minute ago.



“Oh, yes. Um..” I turn away immediately, feeling embarrassed of being caught staring at his million dollar face.



But the awareness continues to spread over my skin, heating it so intensely that I know he is still looking at me. My fingers fidget through the pages and I read out any random question.



“Your honesty about not being involved in any of illegal police cases- Are your claims about your track record holds true?” 



\*Only to realize it too late.\*



# 3. Cold and Calculative



“Are your claims about your track record holds true?” I read any random question only to realize it too late. 



\*Too-fucking-late!\*



I regret asking him this question, just like I regret what I did to him three years ago. One wrong statement in the police station and I sent him to jail. \*Accidentally.\* 



It was not in my intention to take his name that day as my mind was badly preoccupied to save someone from prosecution and unknowingly my lips spelled his name to that infuriating cop in front of me. 



But I never thought my one statement would cause such a havoc in his life, that he would lose everything and the curse will stamp a degrading black spot on his name forever. And no amount of money could buy that whitener which can clear it. 



Like a horror movie, I watch his face getting hard like granite. He lifts his long finger and presses on the pause button of the recorder. Green light blinks to orange and my heart loses a beat.



“Are you \*fucking\* kidding with me, Emara?” Dakota inhales sharply and I watch the glint in his eyes turn dark, animalistically.



Adrenaline rushes through my bones as I hear my name in a threatening way, indicating I stepped into a danger zone. 



“I-I-no. It’s not my question-it’s written here.” Blood drains from my head and I panic breathlessly. 



He presses the button and green light blinks again as he straightens his spine. 



“I am not going to answer the baseless rumours my legal team deals with. That is not something I would waste my time on.” Dakota says in a flat emotionless voice, but his eyes say otherwise. 



His green eyes sharpen like a glass as he stares at me with an intensity that would slit through my skin in the most painful way. 



“Yeah, sorry.” I immediately shuffle through the pages, to look for a better question which will save my ass from his chainsaw cutting gaze. 



“How much trust do you have that in the near future Artificial Intelligence is going to take over the world?” I gulp nervously, avoiding the sweat building in between my breast.



Dakota leans forward and my nose hits with an earthy woodsy scent mixed with some rich cologne. He taps his two long fingers on the glass table and says in a calmer tone, 



“For an example, consider AI as Internet. Now back in 1995, there were not many people on Internet and they believed this online thing was going to be a fad.” 



The way his fingers make circles on the glass, something churns inside of my stomach. Everything about him is alluring and intimidating. Like a red danger sign that blinks of green light. 



“And now the circs of humanity is, you can live without people, but not Internet. The system has infiltrated into your life like a necessity. I believe AI would be a necessity in the future. It has been already started. Our phones, watches, computers are now designed to program with AI and machine learning. It’s like blood and veins, you can separate none from your system.”



The way he described it in a collective manner, makes me want to go take a major in this AI shit. “That’s interesting.” Every cell in my body is overly impressed and is applauding at his little tED-Talk. 



“It is.” His lips curve up arrogantly and he sits back like a boss he is. 



“Many people lack to see it’s a multi-billion dollar bonanza, but only with the use of correct technology.” He smirks at the end, hinting why his company owns the market. 



I find my spine slowly relaxing as I smile at him and read the next question. “You are an alumnus of Washington University, Science and Innovation branch. Being an orpha-” \*The fuck?\*



“You are an orphan?” My eyes snap at him with surprise written all over my face. As if I never really knew this man, he is like that huge iceberg in the Atlantic, and all I saw was the tip. 



Dakota’s jaw clenches as he stares me with his previous stone-cold gaze. “Yes, Miss Stone. I was left in an orphanage at the age of two. It is available in public records.” His voice stern while his fingers curl up in a fist on his thigh. 



Unknowingly I stepped on another \*‘shouldn’t have touched’\* nerve. “I.. didn’t know.” My voice gets soften and I feel ten times more worse than ten minutes ago, before starting this interview. 



But his expression remains stony as if all the emotions in him dried up long ago. And now what is left is a cold-calculative businessman whose only goal is to upgrade the world with technology.



“Being an orphan, how did you achieve that level of big-budget education?” I ask him, chucking away my bag of guilty feelings. 



I just want this interview to be over so I can disappear from his life. Fast and furiously.



“Scholarship and part-time jobs covered my expenses.” He says in a flat tone. 



Images of his part-time job flash in my head, which mostly contained brutal punches and bone shattering blows. People chanting his name, betting on him while he knocks the hell out of his opponents in underground fights.



Suddenly, I feel glad that we met in a professional setting. 



“What was your first job?” I ask him.



“I worked at a dog bakery.” He replies dryly and I almost gasp out loud. 



\*He used to bake dogs? Well, he does look like someone who like cats.\*



“Do you plan to produce your own product, other than providing services to tech giants?” I read to him fast.



“I haven’t thought of that far.” And he replies faster. 



We both want to be done with this interview.



“Which is the turning point day of your life that you owe your success to-” 



Suddenly the recorder on the glass table makes little beeping sound while its green light flicker like heartbeats. I tap the gadget like giving it chest compression, but it breathes its last beep and dies in my palm. 



The green light turns black and no further sound comes from the gone voice recorder. 



\*It’s dead. Dead like Dodo.\* 



I swallow hard and slowly lift my not-so-long lashes at him. Dakota stares down at me with a blank expression. As if his features are fighting a battle not to frown or roll his eyes. 



I bite my lip nervously and blink innocently at him, while he stares at me with a deadpan face.



Dakota takes a deep sigh and pulls out a pen from his chest’s pocket. I shyly take the black steel pen from his hand as if it is a condom. 



“Thank you.” And murmur sheepishly.



The pen feels pleasantly warm in between my fingers, and I know it is the warmth of his body. Something moves inside my belly like worms as my mind display images of his hard body underneath those piles of clothes. \*His eight pack abs.\*



“25th September 2019.”



My eyes look up at him in shock as he spells the date of that awful night of college’s annual fest event, when I met him for the last time. 



When he warned me to never come in front of his eyes, ever. And now here I am, sitting on his leather couch, in his vast cabin, and taking his interview.



“Three years ago, I met with an accident that night when I was driving back to my place. A bit angrily.” He pauses and fixes his green stare at me. 



“I broke my arm and three ribs, and I was hospitalized for two weeks under critical care. During that time of my life, many things were going inside my head. But the one on repeat was, if somehow I would have known, even seconds before that a car out of nowhere is going to crash into mine. I would have saved my few bones.”



I could feel the world slowing down around me, colours fading and replacing with melancholy as I look at his impassive gaze that holds mine like steel. 



“Since then I have been working on augmented reality, integrating it with autopilot and radar, to track the activities on the road in a 360 degree angle to avert such disasters in the future. Which I sold it to Tesla and build my company with those funds in 2020.”



It was only too late for me to figure out that he was answering to my previous question. I swallow my saliva and it took a great effort to gulp it down my clogged throat. 



“So I owe my success to that one blue moon night of my life.” And I know he is not talking about the accident. 



I open a fresh page in the notebook, black ink flows through the pen like blood oozes from a fresh cut and I write his answer with the same feeling.



Every word cuts through me with its knife of regret.



A part of me wants to hold him, hug him tightly and beg for forgiveness. But I know, no amount of my sorry will fix his broken past. \*Ever\*.



I look up and see him going through notifications on his apple watch. Frown decorate his forehead but that didn’t decrease his elegance. He looks equally handsome as he looks heartless.



\*Someone who won’t rest until he owns the world.\*



“Mr. Black, are you busy?” I ask him in a hope to end this meeting.



“No.” He instantly answers, giving me his full predatory attention. As if this interview will give him a billion dollar break, he has been waiting for. 



“Dakota Black, a high achiever, millionaire in his 20s and a hot shot bachelor who got girls drooling for him..” I almost cringe reading out to him. 



“Is your heart surrendering to settle down?” I look up at the end.



# 4. Inch-by-Inch



“Dakota Black, a high achiever, millionaire in his 20s and a hot shot bachelor who got girls drooling for him.. Is your heart surrendering to settle down?” 



I look up at him in \*Italics\* and he stares back at me in \*\*Bold\*\*. 



His thick, roughly trimmed eyebrow inches up in amusement and I instantly double check if I read it right. 



\*Errh!\* Why do they have to write such cheesy \*blushing-till-my-ass\* questions and not ask directly?



I hear him intake a deep breath of frustration and I find myself sinking more into his expensive couch. He looks irritated and most of all, ignited. 



“Didn’t meet any eye-catching woman yet.” He says, directly looking into my eyes. 



\*It’s hard.\* 



Like fighting six fully grown fire-breathing dragons. It is that hard to stare at his toxic green eyes that penetrate into me unapologetically. And like an amateur princess, I crawl my gaze to the notebook and write his answer with his elegant pen. 



\*Didnt-meet-any-ass-catching-woman-ye\*



“What about you?”



My head jerks up in surprise as his deadly quiet voice echoes in my ears. “What about me?” I ask him with a stupefying face. 



\*What about me?\* My anxiety asks as well.



Dakota looks relaxed, his one hand rests on his thigh and another on the arm of couch. His long finger trails the dark stubble of chin as he studies me with his deep stare, like I am some low-budget startup he should invest in. 



“How did you end up here?” My skin pricks as the deep sound of his voice reaches me again. Curiosity draws on his full lips, something that I would call edible.



“I was at the publication house and somehow stumbled here.” I push a loose lock behind my ear and try to pull my confident face. But I am not brave enough to compete with his beastly gaze, and out-stare him is a topic of different dimension. 



“You are into journalism? I thought you were a student of Engineering and Computer Science.” He says without any inflection. 



“Yeah. I mean no.” Something flutters in my heart and my cheeks tickle with rush of blood, knowing he still remembers my major even after three long years. \*Why?\* 



\*Why such a good memory?\*



I wet my lips. His eyes burn into me and I feel compelled to tell him the truth. 



“I wanted money for my final semester project, so I was at the Pegasus Publications to publish my book that I have been writing for some time. But their interviewer had diarrhea, so the editor asked me to take this interview and later sign me as an author so I can get my book published.”



Heat licks my skin the way his gaze peer down at me with a curiosity I have never seen before. 



“You write books?” His eyes flare momentarily in surprise. 



“What kind of?” And asks with an interest as if he will order it the next second. 



\*No, no, NO!\*



My heart flaps like thousand wings and I instantly look down at the little notebook on my lap for diversion. I am not sure if he is really interested or simply asking me questions to pass his leisure time. Which I think he does not have any.



“It’s not your cup of tea.” I say, biting my lip.



My heart speeds up abnormally as he leans down towards me, a bit intimidatingly. His earthy scent hits my nose again, and I clench my thighs in response as I feel his hot gaze licking my skin. 



“And what made you think, Emara?” 



I close my eyes. Chills run through me as I hear my name for the second time in his deep, threatening voice. 



“Without even knowing what I drink.” He whispers darkly and for some messed up reason, my cheeks heat up. 



I bite my lip and when I pluck up the courage to look at him, he is already watching me. His green eyes are focused on the blush of my cheeks and slowly drifts to the space under my jaw and between my neck which disappears inside my red silk shirt. 



I gulp loudly. It was the hardest gulp I did and my anxieties kick in, wondering if I sounded loud. Or worse, \*aroused.\* 



I shake my head to clear the thoughts of red colour and get myself back to the reality. 



“I just thought it’s not your forte. You seem like a logical man, who is into technical stuff and probably reads motivational and leadership books of famous auth-”



“Get to the point.” He speaks like a sharp order, a bit impatiently.



“You won’t like my romance novel.” I blurt out. 



\*And I don’t want you to read it. Please!\*



Dakota narrows his eyes and hints a smile at the corner of his lips. A smile that only a predator does, when he corners his prey. 



“Tell me.. What is your novel about?” He sits back and asks me calmly, as if taking my interview. His long index finger now trails across his lips as he waits for my answer, rather patiently this time. 



“It’s nothing interesting.” I shake my head, nervously. 



“I’ll decide that.” He replies, curtly.



My heart thrashes wildly in my chest as I lift my lashes and watch him staring at me attentively. 



Even while he is just sitting here, doing nothing, there is something dark percolating behind his eyes that just makes me more nervous. 



“It’s a fictional story of a different world, which is ruled by werewolves and their leader is a bit crazy for a girl. And he wants to have her at any cost.” 



I try to keep it short and boring. But the way his eyes glow alive, green and deep. I think I hit the wrong nerve in his head. 



“Wolves?” Hiking up one eyebrow, he shows his surprise. 



And suddenly, my memory files show me images of that heinous wolf tattoo on his back that covers up till the front of his chest and shoulder, while I saw him in the cage. 



The real reason why people called him \*The Alpha.\* 



I immediately look down at the notebook and ruffle through the pages with uncontrolled heartbeats. \*Shit! Shit!\*



“I-I believe I have covered all the questions. Only one is left.” I do not look up at him this time as I read..



“Being an epitome of rag to riches. What do you miss the most from your simple life?” I keep the paper and pen ready for his answer as he says,



“Violence.”



I look up at him. Shocked. 



Like a dramatic pause in a music. 



“I miss the underground fights I was part of. There was something deeply satisfying to hear the crunch of breaking bones, and watch their ego shatter with my every punch till nothing is left in them, other than blood and bones.”



He breathes in deeply. 



“It felt \*so\* good to hurt those motherfuckers, especially knowing I was the cause. That power over another person’s life, even for a minute or two. I miss that thrill. No drug or woman could ever come close to that adrenaline rush I felt in the ring.”



Shards of power flicks in his green eyes and they glow brighter and greener. Like a flowing river in the wild, uncontrolled and unmanned by the nature. 



It took everything in me to look away from his fierce passionate gaze and down to the plain notebook paper, that doesn’t allure me. 



I collect my brain which is all over his face, suit, hands, and write down his answer, word-to-word. 



Once done, I look up at him one last time. 



The way he is reading through his apple watch and simply sitting there, he sucks up all the oxygen in the room. He screams of class, lavishness, sophistication and pure power.



\*Someone I should stay at least a mile away.\* 



I gather my items and with great efforts stand up on my feet while he eases out of his seat easily. His fingers unconsciously close his suit’s button, as if he has done this a thousand times. 



“Thank you for your time, Mr. Black. It was nice seeing you.” I feel my height sinking to the ground as he stands next to me in his 6’ 4. He gives a respectful nod and gestures me towards the door. \*The exit.\* 



I can finally walk out of his claws and his almost perfect life. 



“You look different.” 



My eyes snap back to him as I hear his husky voice sliding through my skin like silk. Adrenaline pumps through my veins and my face blushes with the instant flow of blood. 



“Yeah. I don’t colour my hair now.” I tuck one of the escaped locks of my hair behind my ear as I pretend to not get intimidated by him. 



I remember I had blue hair when I met him for the first time. It’s strange how he remembers unnecessary details about me.



“Not hair. You gained weight.” He says low and deep, taking a quick glance at my body and suddenly, my self-conscious demons rises from the dark. 



“I look fat?” I ask him shockingly. My confidence sinks down to my tummy, which I thought I tucked nicely behind the black pencil skirt I am wearing. 



“You look better.” A smile hints at the corner of his lips as he says without looking at me, as if he clearly remembers me, inch by inch how I looked years ago.



\*Oh boy! Was that a compliment?\*

1mofx8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousePowered/comments/1mofx8w/explore_the_best_nugget_ice_maker_cowsar_and_is/,Explore the Best Nugget Ice Maker Cowsar and Is It Worth It,"Stacked on my kitchen counter, the Cowsar Z5815NH Black Nugget Ice Maker quickly became a surprising favorite of mine. Honestly, I wasn’t sure how much I’d care about having chewable nugget ice within arm’s reach, but this machine delivered an unexpected boost to my daily beverage game and, to my shock, my general enjoyment of cool drinks. Compact and unassuming, it sits neatly without overtaking the kitchen, yet promises rapid, chewable ice bliss. Ask anyone obsessed with perfectly chilly iced coffee or crushable ice for smoothies, and they’ll probably understand the allure this nugget ice maker holds.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The slim design caught my eye immediately. At 11.81 x 9.01 x 12.9 inches, it’s compact but doesn’t sacrifice functionality. Light enough to shift around the kitchen (or even bring to a barbecue) but sturdy enough not to wobble when it’s operating, it strikes a balance perfect for home use. The matte black finish brings understated luxury—it looks modern and clean, a nice visual touch alongside performance. If kitchen counter space is tight, this checks the box without screaming, ""gadget overload.""

**Upsides**  
- The chewable-soft nugget ice texture is a game changer for cocktails, sodas, or just munching directly.
- Simple one-click operation that’s honestly refreshing in today’s overly-complicated appliance market.
- Transparent window lets you peek in on the magic—watching ice form feels unintentionally soothing.
- Produces up to 34 pounds of ice daily (way more than I thought I’d need until the summer hit).  
- Self-cleaning mode? Yes, please! Time-saver and peace of mind rolled into one feature.  

[Check Cowsar Z5815NH Black Nugget Ice Maker price on Amazon.](https://chvnx.com/p/b0d4qckvck/)

**Performance in Action**  
Put simply, this countertop nugget ice maker is fast. I turned it on the first day, crossed my fingers, and hoped for a miracle… Within 20 minutes, the soft, chewable ice started rolling out—no hiccups, no hassle, just cool efficiency. For anyone hosting larger gatherings, its ability to crank out 34 pounds of ice in 24 hours comes in clutch. During movie nights, the kids couldn’t get enough of the crunchy ice (who knew ice could lead to sibling bonding?). The machine adjusts to your needs, stopping automatically when the ice bin fills or when it’s time to refill the water reservoir. It simplifies life in ways I didn’t realize I needed.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Noise isn’t overwhelming, but it’s noticeable in super quiet environments, especially as ice cubes drop.  
- The automatic shut-off sometimes halts ice production prematurely—emptying the bin or refilling the water can require babysitting.  
- While compact, the device might still feel bulky for extra-tight shelves or cabinets.  
- Ice isn’t always perfectly uniform in size—not a deal breaker, but worth noting for perfectionists.

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Even folks new to appliances will feel at home here—the buttons do exactly what you need, with no nonsense mixed in. Running low on water? There’s no need to panic; the light comes on as a gentle reminder. Want it clean without elbow grease? Tap the self-cleaning feature and sit back. While the self-cleaning function’s awesome, I do recommend occasionally giving the interior a manual scrub with removable parts for any scale buildup, depending on water hardness in your area. The top detaches easily, turning what could’ve been a chore into a quick task.  

**Product Competitors**  
I did some digging and tried a few other competing products in the same price and feature range. Key shoutouts to the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker and Frigidaire EFIC235. Let me spill the tea here: the GE Opal's sleek tech features are fancy but come with a hefty price that made me wince. Frigidaire, on the flip side, performed reasonably well for a slightly lower cost, but its noise levels felt unnecessarily intrusive. Compared to these, the Cowsar nugget ice maker balances affordability, function, and aesthetics nicely. Unless voice controls or apps are strictly non-negotiable for you, it holds its ground admirably.  

**Value for Money**  
With its simple user-friendly design, dependable ice production, and convenience-enhancing features, it’s hard to argue against its value for daily or occasional use. Sure, it’s pricier than grabbing a cheap bag of ice from the gas station, but this machine flexes convenience—and honestly, soft nugget ice hits different when it’s made fresh at home. If you’re big on hosting, summer drinks, or quirky snacks for kids, the price feels justified.

“Accountability” for not meeting expectations has just turned into write-up city. I’ve never seen so many partners get fired / receive their finals so quickly and so close together :(. It just feels like slapping a band-aid over any underlying issues rather than talking about them.

When it comes to customers, we’re supposed to have good faith and assume the best before assuming the worse. But for partners, the people actually running the place, there is no good faith. Just a documented write-up and the potential of losing your job over, perhaps, literal spilled coffee.

1moftb6,https://i.redd.it/wph1mt7dnmif1.jpeg,"creepy men in my office. its a boys club now. cant get out, bad market.","idek where to start. my team is full of shitty men. i blame the manager for it because i think he hires people who match his vibe, which is misogynistic, chauvinistic bullshit with a label of fake smile taped on it.

i am slowly going to introduce you to the trope of apes that i have to deal with at work. For now, let me introduce you to my manager (lets call him snake) and a senior of mine (lets call him frog)

  
so i was very young and naive when i joined this company (its an MNC btw). we usually do team lunches but my manager Snake has to ensure everyone knows that he's a ""cool"" manager, so he made it into a team dinner. Mind you frog is also with us here. we went to a brewery from office. kept all our bags in snake's car. there were drinks, smokes etc. i was like, damn, this team is so cool (this so called chill culture will bite me in the a\*\*)

after the dinner, snake said he's leaving and offered to drop some of on his way back home. he mentioned that whoever wanted to stay back, could do so. I agreed for the free ride, didnt wanna pay for cab. frog decided to stay back and drink some more. as if the jugs of beer chugged down werent enough. rest of us went to the car, realised frog's bag is here too. i offered to go back in and give him his bag. I went back, everyone filed in the car and waited. i was holding the bag infront of me with both my hands. when he saw me reaching towards him, he stood up & started walking towards me. i was about to extend my arms to give him the bag when he stepped a bit too close and decided to lean in for a kiss. God bless my instincts, i leaned back in time. i didnt know what to think. i was shocked and scared more than anything. he prolly saw the fear in my eyes and started apologising ""oh i had too many beer, im sorry"" ""i didnt mean to"" ""its not what you think"" ""you're getting this wrong""

i just pushed the bag to him and ran away. i had just joined this company, i had rejected all my other offers, the market was bad, this was an MNC, i didnt have enough experience to get another job easily, i had bills to pay, i already moved to this city for this job, i cant tell mom this happened- she'd never let me live alone out of worry, there was no other woman on the team that i could talk to really, what if nobody believes me- there's no proof afterall, was there a cctv in the brewery?, what if they blame me- im young & i did have one beer.

i didnt speak a word in the car. i was dropped off at my house. idr if i cried but i just slept. next day, i avoided that frog like a plague, i was shit scared to be alone with him. he wanted to apologise, he tried to talk to me in coffee room, i ran away, literally. i didnt want to be approached. i didnt know what to say, what to feel, what to do. i didnt want to think of that night. period. 

  
guess what he decides to do?

after office, im chilling in my room, scrolling. knock knock, who's there? the creep of a senior from your office. i looked at him for a second, he smiled, i felt uncomfortable. ""can i come in"" creepy smile. i didnt want him to but i didnt want to create a scene, i just got this place. and frog is the typa person who can actually make you pull your hair out with the constant non sensible,  irritating, repeats-the-same-thing-in-active-passive-17-times-in-a-row way of talking. 

i let him in, all senses on alert. he starts talking, apologising. i am hmm-ing along, anything to get him out of my house. he says ""im about to get a divorce soon, im going through a lot"" i took 3 steps away from him, he tried to make a move on me WHILE HE WAS MARRIED. i dont want to remember what all he talked about but he left after 2 painful hours of him talking. all i remember from that experience is how i almost threw up after he left because of all the panic. my brain shut down from fear. 

how did he know my place? a couple days back, my manager-snake had offered to drop me as its on the way to his house. frog was going to snake's house, he was in the car.

the next day after office, i was feeling kinda sad. i went to a pub alone. met some girls there, they invited me over, i went along (i was in the worst state of mind). it was around 1am, we were playing board games, i get a call from him. i ignore. 2 more calls, ignored. i pick up the next one. uk how parents tend to add ""o"" or ""u"" at the end of half of your name and use that to call you endearingly? he starts the call by addressing me with that version of my name, something only my mom has the right to call me.

""*myname+u* where are you?""

""at my friend's place, why?""

""oh.""

a pause

""i was standing infront of your door""

my blood ran cold. so now this guy is going to show up out of nowhere at my place at such odd hours!?!?

""okay""

a pause. he expected me to go ""*oh i'll be there, wait for me""* 

*""*when are you coming back""

""not anytime soon""

""oh okay""

a pause

""have a good night then""

i hung up without responding.

the only saving grace is the fact that frog lives states away. he works remote. he's only here every quarter or so. 

i changed houses a month after that. i now live in a gated community where you need permission to get inside.

  
this guy, who's 11 years older than me, decided that it'd be a good idea to reach a junior's house when she is clearly avoiding you, is scared of you and doesnt wanna talk to you- to apologise for trying to kiss her (unprovoked) while he was still married.

  
this is only the introduction of one of the a\*\*holes i have to work with. there are so many more lores to come.

i am now a little stronger, firmer, smile way less in office, keep interactions to people outside my friends in office minimal, have my lunch late (i'll tell you later why). i come, sit on my desk, work until late afternoon, eat lunch alone in 20 mins, work and leave. the team and the company can burn to ashes for all i care.

1mofrit,https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/1mofrit/i_want_to_hug_whoever_made_trazodone/,I want to hug whoever made Trazodone,"First time posting here.

I've had extremely vivid nightmares since I was a teenager (I'm 33 now), and the fatigue that came with that didn't hit me with full force until I moved out on my own at 31. I went to a sleep specialist, who was sure by the shape of my face and tongue that I had sleep apnea.

I did a sleep study, and...no apnea. At which I burst into tears in front of the doctor. I'd lost most of my vision a few months prior, a family member had died, and that was just the thing that opened my tears floodgate.

  
After calming me down, the sleep doctor explained that I spend a lot of time in REM sleep, and wake up from that super fast. Like, I jerk awake out of dreams. He asked which I wanted help with more, the nightmares or the fatigue. He didn't want to give me multiple medications at the same time.

  
""Fatigue,"" I replied instantly, ""I write horror, I can deal with nightmares.""

  
So he gave me Modafinil, and it was like day and night on the daytime exhaustion. My fatigue went from an 8 that left me suicidal, down to maybe a 3 or so. I still had trouble sleeping, but I was glad just to not be so tired I wanted to die.

  
Fast forward about two years, to last week. I had an appointment with my GP, and while I was there, decided to ask about sleep medications. I kept my mouth shut that I was starting to hallucinate full-on shadow people, because I did not feel like playing the ""sleep deprivation, possible schizophrenia, or Charles bonnet Syndrome"" guesting game.

  
After a few questions about my sleep hygiene (and explaining that no, melatonin only works for about one night and gives me even more vivid nightmares than usual) my GP proscribed Trazodone. I made the mistake of looking at the reviews on [drugs.com](http://drugs.com), which were evenly split between ""this is awesome"" and ""this was horrible and made all my limbs fall off and my eyeballs exploded.""

I decided ""oh, fuck it,"" and started taking the new medicine. If my eyes exploded, well, I'm almost fully blind already. I've got a white cane and know how to use it.

And I proceeded to get the best sleep I've gotten in years. Less hypnogogic hallucinations that would startle me awake, which is going to be so weird to get used to. If I got up, I could easily fall back to sleep.

Not only has it helped me sleep, I feel so much calmer and less depressed now. My thinking is clearer, and the shadow people have stopped. What extra tiredness I feel can be helped with coffee or tea. The passive suicidal thoughts are just...gone.

I want to hug both my GP, and whoever invented this and figured out that 50mg helps with sleep. I feel like my life has started back up again. I'm actually able to sit down and work on a story, rather than putting pressure on myself to write because someone came out with a new book and I'm failing at being an author.

The only side effects I've had is my nose feeling stuffed up in the morning, and orgasms have gone from underwhelming to painful because of overstimulation. But I'm asexual so this doesn't bother me at all. I'll happily trade being able to come for being able to sleep.",2,1755021199.0,insomnia,0,1.0,False

Had a sinus infection in January 2025 caused my eardrum to burst on my left ear. Since then I’ve had pain under my jaw on the left side of my neck where I think a lymph would be.

These pink/brown flat spots on my skin first showed up 2.5 years ago and have been increasing in number in different places I don’t know if it’s related but they don’t look like freckles. They are around 3-5mm in width they don’t have defined borders it’s like a soft bleed of colour into the surrounding skin.

Have not experienced weight gain or loss but I feel like I have more fat on my belly ? I’m really Concerned about spots on skin. Derm didn’t know what they were wanted to do a biopsy.

Went skating during winter, saw a small little orchestra concert, invited her to some friend group get togethers, etc... only once a month, because she's always busy hanging with her own friends, going to concerts, traveling and such.

I swear I only saw her as a friend at first. Like she just gets me, like a close friend or sister vibe? does that make sense?

Anyways. I don't know when, but now I kinda see her as more and I hate it. Because I haven't been in this situation since highschool. BUT at least with highschool it was always a friend in our group, so they were still in our friend group when I told them I liked them.

But in this case. Do I tell her? If she says no, does that ruin our friendship? She assumed I saw her as a friend, but now I like her, is that a kinda distrust? I'm so screwed

TL;DR: met girl on tinder. became friends. hanged out monthly. now I like her. heck",1,1755021048.0,dating_advice,5,1.0,False
1mofovq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mofovq/planned_mother_daughter_trip_attempt_2/,Planned Mother Daughter Trip Attempt #2,"I’m looking for some advice and perspective. My mom and I have planned a weekend trip next week. We actually tried to do this last year, but I had to cancel last minute because my daughter got sick. My mom was upset but eventually came around. (I guess? We never fully talked it out.)

Our relationship has always been a bit strained, and my mom and sister often go on trips together, but I’ve never really been included. Being a stay at home mom and married, I guess I’ve been left out of those plans. So honestly, this trip feels really important to me like a chance to finally connect. If it matters, I’m 33 and my younger sister who lives at home is 31. 

That said, money is really tight right now. We’re waiting on a loan that should help stabilize things, but even if the trip isn’t super expensive, I know I’ll probably spend the whole time worrying about how much we’re spending. I can hardly get a drive thru coffee now without being riddled with guilt. The loan isn’t even guaranteed but it would definitely help us out. 

My husband doesn’t know I’m second guessing the trip, because I don’t want him feeling guilty or stressed about it. He already has enough guilt about our situation given that he is our home’s breadwinner. Anytime something with this comes up, he spirals into thinking he’s a failure which I know is absolutely not true. Life has just happened. 

I’ve even thought about just talking to my mom and thinking of a different excuse to tell my husband. Honestly, this is mostly a passing thought because we don’t hide anything from each other. I’m just trying to protect him. 

I fear even approaching it with my mom. I don’t want her to think I’m just trying to get out of doing something with her when I genuinely really want to. 

I want to be honest with myself and my family about what’s best, but I’m torn between wanting to go to build that connection with my mom and thinking not going would be the most financially responsible.

Any thoughts or advice would be very much appreciated. I have no idea where to go from here. ",1,1755021034.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

It’s been rough for me for quite some time, but after around 2,5 months of no contact at all, I reached out and she was in for a coffee. Cool.
So, we just met and although it was a bit odd in the first minutes, we spend the next 2 hours talking, laughing and having a good time. No discussions over the past and no relationship or dating related talks. 
She should know that I’m not interested in being friends, since I stated that clearly after she ended it! And I somehow think she’s not completely dumb, so it should be clear that I didn’t look for a coffee partner today. She herself said back then that she would only reach out if anything would change (in terms of being willing to give it a second chance). However, in fact it was me who reached out and I’m just confused now. 

She’s leaving for vacation next weekend so I gave it like a little shot and said during the goodbye something like: „well in case we don’t see each other before your vacation, enjoy it“. She just thanked me and said goodbye. 

I’m not really willing to go into overthinking for the next month, so maybe someone has an opinion on that. Did I somehow land in the friendzone again? Or is there a chance that no contact had some positive impact?
I don’t plan on reaching out next to be honest.

I would rather get a proper coffee machine but don’t have space nor time/energy and will likely collect dust.

The missus brought up wanting a nespresso, even though she doesn’t drink coffee really. More of a matcha, frappe or milky coffee kind of person. She will probably use it once or twice a week at most

So I was thinking an essenza + aerocino is perfect, since I can hide the frother and keep the Essenza out. But the lattisma is one £41 more and I have a £100 gift voucher.

So it would either cost me £58 (essenza +aerocino) or £99.

I am 33 year-old female I would not say I am heavy overweight, but could lose a little bit of weight. I played sports my entire life. Have always enjoyed being active was in the military for a bit and even enjoyed the gym afterwards.

In my early going into mid 20s, I started experiencing random heart palpitations ranging from a couple of times a week to maybe a couple times a day then I would have times for a few weeks or a month without any and then about three years ago I started getting them pretty much daily with the rare occasion of going a few weeks or a couple days without them.

Even on my propanolol, I still get breakthrough palpitations and still get them often. I’d say on the average day I’m experienced about 20+ and on a bad day a couple of hundred. 

A few years back I got the original Covid and I’m not blaming it, but I started to feel just unlike myself moving forward. Palpitations got worse after I worked out I’d get them if I was stressed I’d get them. I’m tired. Get them if I drink, I’d get them if I ate too much I’d get them. Seems like everything is a trigger for them 

I’ve seen more cardiologist and you can think of I’ve had EKGs hold or monitors echoes stress test you name it. They’ve caught a couple of short burst of SVT and palpitations and have been trying to get me to just accept them and move forward. 

The problem is is these are ruining my quality of life. The first year I was on propanolol gave me a lot back and this past year started not really working. I went up the dose. It worked for a little bit, but I still am not where I was even a year ago. 

I’ve had tons of blood work done for some reason despite taking vitamins I cannot get my vitamin D up and my B12 sits a little above 200 

I for the first time in my life have pretty regular periods about every 33 to 35 days. I’ve always struggled with a hormone imbalance and notice in my luteal phase that my palpitations are worse. 

I constantly have face flushing, no matter what I eat. I’m no doctor, but I suspect maybe a little issue with histamine just due to seeing some symptoms after I eat certain foods. 

My spouse tries to be supportive and I try to explain that it’s really depressing not feeling like yourself for years 

I get the feeling that my doctors are annoyed by me and I’m honestly not even that persistent but they get annoyed when I don’t wanna accept their answers or just take their answers that it’s all anxiety causing these symptoms. 

I would say my main symptoms are :

- palpitations
- low energy/ fatigue
- headaches/ muscle tensions in coat hanger area
- flushing of face
- just not feeling like me
- gi issues (constant reflux, motility disorder of esophagus, Ibs)

I totally get that your body gets older and maybe I’m in the next phase of the hormone transition in my life.

I have tried meditation, mindfulness therapy, and all of these other relaxing techniques. I’ve tried low impact working out. I rarely eat processed stuff and I drink socially once in a blue moon and drink primarily water I have maybe half a cup to one cup of coffee a day and I usually try to eat and drink water before I even do that And I’m even paying out-of-pocket to see a functional medicine specialist

I feel crazy, but I’m in my early 30s and I really feel like I should be enjoying my life and I really wanna start a family but I’m so tired of feeling like this. I really have good days and probably get a handful of good days in a month. I can accept the occasional heart palpitations that people have but I really don’t understand how doctors expect you to just live with these when they are disturbing and uncomfortable . I’m tired of not feeling like myself. I miss exercising. I miss being me and I hate that if I try to eat something out of the ordinary or have a drink that I have to pay for it.

If anyone has taken the time to read this, I would appreciate any input or testing recommendations are honestly just any advice that makes me feel like they will be a solution to this I feel like I just keep hitting all of these dead ends and I don’t want there to be something wrong with me, but I just want there to be a solution to me getting my life back ",1,1755020584.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

1mofgot,https://discord.gg/gSGGzjSAYf,CATX Earnings,"CATX (Perspective Therapeutics) is a biopharma company that has been generating significant interest among investors. Here's a summary of what Redditors are saying about its earnings and potential:

# Positive Highlights

* **Recent Financial Activity**: CATX raised $87.4 million in private placements and has formed strategic partnerships, including one with Bristol Myers Squibb. [""CATX Perspective Therapeutics""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1bkkrmw/catx_perspective_therapeutics/)
* **Insider Buying**: There has been notable insider buying, indicating confidence in the company's future. [""Massive Insider Buying Clusters Found – PBF, JELD, WOLF, CATX""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1k92tz9/massive_insider_buying_clusters_found_pbf_jeld/)
* **Potential for Growth**: Some Redditors believe that CATX could follow a similar trajectory to other successful biopharma companies. [""So this vaguely reminds me of $sls a couple years ago.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1bkkrmw/comment/kw10i13/)

# Concerns and Risks

* **Market Sentiment**: Despite positive news, the stock is still volatile and risky, especially given its market cap and phase of development. [""I would say JELD looks safest of the three, now that WOLF has already gone up 20%, and given CATX has a market cap of $175m without even being at phase three""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1k92tz9/comment/mphyfn4/)
* **Scam Allegations**: There have been some concerns about CATX being a scam, particularly in the context of cryptocurrency. [""CATX is a scam coin. Bought a few dollars worth and can’t sell it.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1i4mwne/catx_is_a_scam_coin_bought_a_few_dollars_worth/)

# Earnings and Financial Outlook

* **No Specific Earnings Data**: As of the latest discussions, there is no detailed earnings data available. However, the company is expected to provide updates at upcoming conferences. [""They posted on Twitter they will be at conference this week in Chile.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1bkkrmw/comment/kw0dos9/)

# Investment Strategy

* **High-Risk, High-Reward**: CATX is considered a high-risk investment due to its early-stage nature and market volatility. [""I always get wiped out on penny stocks i go get a coffee come back and im wiped in 10min smhh""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1k92tz9/comment/mpbhdb3/)
* **Long-Term Potential**: Despite the risks, some investors are optimistic about the long-term potential of CATX, especially if it can successfully navigate its clinical trials and partnerships. [""Multiple open market buys at $2–$3 levels. No selling activity reported after the buys.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1k92tz9/massive_insider_buying_clusters_found_pbf_jeld/)",1,1755020544.0,Options_Beginners,0,1.0,False

1mofb7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mofb7y/does_lavazza_blue_classy_mini_lb_300_espresso/,Does Lavazza BLUE Classy Mini LB 300 Espresso Machine Truly Impress Review,"Testing out the Lavazza LB 300 Lavazza Blue Classy Mini Single Serve Espresso Coffee Machine has been an interesting journey, and I must admit it’s an espresso maker that stands out for several reasons. I’ve had this elegant and compact darling in my kitchen for a couple of weeks now, and every time I use it, I think it deserves a well-rounded review that lays out the good, the quirky, and what you might want to watch out for.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The design is undeniably sleek, and that classy dark blue color with chrome accents really adds a pop to my countertop, almost like a tiny statuette for coffee lovers. Measuring just 5.3” wide, it’s a lifesaver for small kitchens like mine, where counter space comes at a premium. I live in a small urban apartment, and compact yet stylish gadgets are my weakness. For something that can pump out such terrific espresso, I half expected it to demand more space, but its slim profile proved me wrong.

**Ease of Use and Controls**  
Operating this machine feels incredibly intuitive, even for someone like me, who isn’t morning-functional until my first coffee shot. There are only two touch controls—one for espresso and another for lungo. Everything is streamlined to minimize decision fatigue, especially when rushing out the door. The programmable free dose option was a pleasant surprise and allowed me to tweak my espresso shots precisely as I like them, which is slightly stronger than the default setting. Not having to fiddle with extra buttons or spend ages figuring out the manual was a major win for me and probably my pre-coffee morning brain.  

[Check Lavazza LB 300 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b07rvdjw56/)

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Now, this machine doesn’t just look pretty—it means business. With its fully automatic operation mode and compatibility with Lavazza Blue capsules, I’ve consistently been able to pull coffee with rich, velvety crema on top. That crema alone made me feel like I had mastered some barista-level magic, though credit definitely belongs to the machine. The taste quality is superb, offering that authentic espresso flavor without having to scuttle out to my local coffee shop. Lungo is also handled remarkably well, offering a smooth brew with no watery aftertaste often found in competitor machines' longer pours. The only hiccup I spotted was with non-Lavazza capsules—they aren’t always as reliable with this machine, and your coffee quality might vary.   

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Handling maintenance isn’t something I like to spend too much time on, and this espresso maker doesn’t demand a lot. Cleaning is straightforward due to its reusable filter type; however, I did find that residual water accumulates somewhat in the drip tray faster than I’d anticipated. Now, while the water tank capacity of 0.2 gallons is reasonable for a machine this size, I do find myself refilling it more often when I have friends over or am in desperate need of extra caffeine hits. Still, for personal use, it’s manageable.   

**Perks**  
- Compact and space-saving  
- Stylish and modern design with Italian edge  
- Intuitive touch controls for espresso and lungo  
- Consistently high-quality espresso results  
- Easy to clean thanks to the reusable filter  

**Critiques**  
- Exclusively Lavazza Blue capsule compatibility limits options  
- Frequent drip tray emptying might annoy some users  
- Small water tank can feel limiting during heavy use  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at rivals in the market, machines like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or Keurig’s K-Slim Coffee Maker often come up in this discussion. Nespresso models are similar in compactness and ease of use, but they use their own proprietary pods, which might skew the taste somewhat differently. On the flavor front, Lavazza Blue capsules, in my experience, have fresher, more authentic espresso vibes compared to what I’ve brewed with Nespresso’s ecosystem. Keurig's K-Slim sits in the same ballpark of convenience, though its versatility favors general coffee drinkers more than espresso aficionados. On energy efficiency, however, both Nespresso and Keurig machines are slightly ahead, so Lavazza doesn’t win in every category.

**Affordable Quality**  
For an espresso machine that fits small spaces, delivers exceptional coffee, and looks downright stunning while doing so, I’d say its price point is fair. When stacked up against comparable machines, the value derived from Lavazza Blue capsules combined with the machine’s automatic functions justifies the investment. Of course, if you’re after more extensive drink variety or a massive water reservoir, you might look elsewhere.

I’ve put together a detailed 7-day Bali trip for late September and would love to get your feedback. I’m traveling with friends (we’re a group of 4) — we’re looking for a mix of water activities, exploring iconic temples, relaxing at beaches, and a bit of shopping.

We’re not trying to cram too much in, but we do want to hit some “must-do” activities like:

* Snorkeling in Nusa Penida (with some exploring)
* Beginner-friendly scuba diving
* Lempuyang Temple (Gates of Heaven) & Tirta Empul
* Saraswati Temple & Ubud Palace
* Coffee tasting
* Uluwatu sunset & Kecak fire dance
* Some beach time

We’ll be arriving in Bali on Day 1 around 3 PM and flying out on Day 7 around 2 PM.  
We’re okay skipping things like Monkey Forest and Mount Batur if it keeps the trip relaxed.

Here’s the Google Doc with our current plan: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qt9al54TF6m02MLeP6ESYQflv6ZSFsFHE38SryQq3qk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qt9al54TF6m02MLeP6ESYQflv6ZSFsFHE38SryQq3qk/edit?usp=sharing)

Would love any advice on:

* Whether the flow of the trip makes sense
* Best spot for beginner scuba diving — we’re currently considering Menjangan or Tulamben
* Any hidden gems or small adjustments to make the trip smoother

Tired of years of unexplainable anxiety, appearing at the most random moments (driving, social interactions, buying groceries, even on holidays). Why not trying to rule out caffeine?

The first months decaf I saw some moderate improvements. But nothing life changing, I was disappointed.
Then I changed to 0 mg intake. So no green tea, no dark chocolate either.
Oh, that's when things dramatically improved. It felt like...this is how life should feel? No constant rush as reaction for the most anodine situations. 

Six months went by caffeine free.
During that period, my dad passed away unexpectedly. I thought this is it, I'm going to get back again but even worse, spiralling down. But it did not, albeit the massive grief.

The first thing I noticed in this period was sleep.
I have always had very meager sleep, with even scary night terrors (waking up screaming, HR 180, needing to run) here and now and recurrent bad dreams. 
They are a thing of the past. 

Some other 'dramatic' improvements: I can drive for hours without any anxiety. Be in downtown surrounded by lots of people. Take my time at the grocery store instead of rushing through it. I can go climbing.

It feels a mix of a relief and sadness. Feeling like I wasted years, because I spent rhem trying absolutely everything to calm down a bit: meditation, ACT therapy, supplements, you call it.

Now, the interesting thing came two weeks ago, when I did a nutrigenetic DNA test. I did not go for it in relation to caffeine, but for a totally different reason.
You can guess my surprise when I receive the report and read the following lines:

***
**It seems that caffeine consumption may significantly increase your anxiety levels.** 
Caffeine is a widely used substance known for its psycho-stimulant effects. In some individuals, moderate to high doses 
of caffeine can lead to anxiety. Certain genetic polymorphisms can shed light on why
 some people are more sensitive to the anxiety-inducing effects. These 
polymorphisms impact genes responsible for encoding adenosine receptors, including 
the ADORA2A gene. Under normal conditions, caffeine deactivates adenosine receptors, 
so any polymorphism affecting these receptors will alter the response to caffeine. **In your specific case, you have two copies of the rs5751876 variant, indicating a higher 
likelihood of experiencing elevated anxiety levels after consuming moderate amounts 
of coffee.**
***

And there it was in front of my eyes, the confirmation that I had been drinking anxiety-inducing liquid *jour après jour* over the last 14 freaking years. To hell with caffeine, never ever again.

-----------
Some data about myself:

Ex-caffeine, 31y, male, Hispanic, 14 y of caffeine consumption  
Method to quit : tapering down 4 weeks ( no coffee -> no black tea -> no green tea -> no caffeine)

Average caffeine consumption before quitting: 300-500 mg (1 black teas, 1 green tea, 2 Nespresso Vertuo coffees)

Body Battery ~80 to 99/100

Cincinnati starter Brady Singer (4.53 ERA) has allowed 10 hits in just his last 2 outings, friends. With today’s starter being so hittable so to speak, I imagine the entire Phillies lineup will get a piece. That said, if I’m picking favourites, my money’s on Kyle Schwarber to snag at least 2 bases today.

Today I finally took a full practice test of all the subjects I plan to take (eng, math, reading). I got a 35 on English, 33 on math, and a whopping 23 on reading. Tbh I genuinely don't know how I did this bad lol, and the reading section was rated like a 7 or so on the prep sharp website. But it's clear that the issue is fatigue since I had increasingly rising scores all of last week from a 26-33 in reading. 
How can I find a way to not get fatigued? Is there any way to like (for lack of a better word) study for it?

I found mudwtr because I was having issues with Coffee/Caffeine, it was giving me crippling acid reflux/heart burn.  I tried several different coffee brands and types, but nothing helped, so I decided to just quit.  The first time I tried mudwtr I kind of jumped with surprise; it was not what I was expecting.  My mouth was expecting something coffee-like and the first taste was surprising (and I wasn't sure I liked it).  My first reaction was that it tasted 'peppery' almost spicey and I was worried it might give me heartburn (but it did not).  And I could taste a bit of turmeric (I think), a bit of cinnamon, and bit of cacao.. maybe some things I couldn't identify, but it was a lot of taste which I wasn't sure about at first.  After about a week though, I started to like it... and after a month, I was totally sold and looked forward to it every day.

That was my sample order, then I decide to order a full 90-day pack... and it became my daily coffee replacement and I was happy.  I got another 90-day pack after a bit and everything was good.  I think it was my third 90-day pack... and all of the sudden I noticed a huge difference in taste.  There was no peppery taste.. I couldn't taste Chai... I couldn't taste cacao... honestly, I couldn't taste much of anything.  I was very disappointed and thought maybe I got a bad batch.  I added some sugar, I put in more milk, I even bought some unsweetened cacao... eventually after putting multiple things in every day, it taste a bit better but I missed the old taste... and stopped really enjoying drinking it daily.

I figured I'd give it one more shot.  I ordered another 90-day bag (hoping I got some from a bad batch)... and I am so disappointed to say that I apparently did not.  MUD/WTR now tastes basically like nothing.  I guess it is closer to the name, it just tastes like dirty water.  There is no identifiable taste to it.  Even if this is good for me... I'm not sure if I can keep drinking it because it's just so bland.  I'd rather have a taste I didn't like... than no taste at all.  Very disappointing.  I guess I will have to find a new substitute, any recommendations?  Anybody else noticed this?",1,1755019620.0,mudwtr,0,1.0,False

1moeve6,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1moeve6/which_car_to_trade_in_general_budgeting_advice/,"Which car to trade in, & general budgeting advice?","Hi everyone, I'm looking for car purchasing and general budgeting advice.

**Car Topic:**

What car makes the most sense to trade in? We have:

2022 Nissan Sentra SV - Basic trim/everything, minor cosmetic damages

* About 22,000 miles
* About  $11,000 left on the loan

2017 Toyota Corolla - Basic trim/everything, no damages

* About 63,000 miles
* About $3,000 left on the loan

We will probably pay this one off before doing any trade in.

We are looking at various years for these cars:

* Subaru Ascent
* Kia Sportage or Seltos
* Honda CR-V
* Maybe a Toyota RAV4?

Other info:

We have one small child (2yo) that will need a car seat/booster seats for a while longer, no plans for more children or pets. The Subaru Ascent is appealing because of the safety features. Others are cheaper price-wise...

We do not have extra funds to put down along with the trade in.

We currently pay about $570/month for both car payments, we would like to stay within this range.

**My question is, does it even make sense to get a new car right now? See our monthly expenses below...**

**General Budgeting Topic:**

We live in a HCOL area on the east coast.

Avg. Income: $7,500/month

Savings: About $6,000 - 8,000

We did a large necessary home improvement project that ate up a good chunk of our emergency savings... We haven't been able to rebuild that emergency savings since then due to random, pricy expenses popping up.

**Monthly expenses:**

Mortgage (Including Home Ins.): $1,860/m

Daycare: $1,080/m

Cars: $570/m ($320 Nissan/$250 Toyota)

Car Ins: $366/m

Internet: $123/m

Phone plan: $130/m

Electricity: Varies $100 - $350/m, highest has been $500 but that's rare

Student Loans: $250/m

Oil/Heating: $600/m in winter, $600/3 months in summer

Subs: $115/m

Groceries: Varies $200 - $400/m

Prescriptions: $45/m

Misc. stuff (Gas, kid stuff, vet bills, health care, eating out, coffee, home improvement, random purchases): $400 - $700/m

My numbers say we have some money left over every month (Around $1,100+ left over some months, supposedly), but it doesn't feel like it. I feel like I'm missing something somewhere...

We are not able to actively save much of anything outside of about $100/month. I know those miscellaneous things add up quickly, we need to cut those out.

Our ultimate goal is to get higher paying jobs and work on our budget so we can start really saving... That's a work in progress right now. We have an end goal of moving/buy a new house in the same general area about 8-10 years from now, with what is hopefully a large (100k) downpayment... I'm applying to and interviewing for jobs that will almost double my income... But this market is extremely rough. My husband is actively looking for higher paying roles too.

Any advice would be welcome, feel free to ask any clarifying questions.

A fuckton of cops showed up to the park in SF that I was camped at right at sundown, driving around flashing their spotlights into the woods and on the beach where people camp. We ended up having to actually run away, to which they followed, but we got off the road and hid behind a trash can in some dirt from the spotlights. They tried, but couldn't see us anymore so they kept driving. Then we ran some more, and had to scale a mini cliff to get out of the park fast and out of sight. After we got out, we saw that there were practically entire camps littered all around the trash cans... Not a coincidence. So we took public transportation as far as we could, getting the hell out of the city, and ending up in some bougie ass town where the cops got called on us for just sitting down for a second. They questioned us bunch and asked if we're ""in the homeless situation""... To which we said no of course not, we stay in hotels and we're just waiting on a friend. They drove off, then 10 minutes later came back saying they got 4 more calls on us. For just sitting. Thank goodness the cops here have nothing to do so they really didn't give a shit...

The sign slapped against the glass door in the wind—bold, blocky letters that caught my eye mid-jog. I wasn’t out for exercise. I was trying to outrun the weight pressing on my chest: overdue rent, climbing student loans, and the hollow thud of every “We regret to inform you” that kept piling into my inbox.

I had a degree. Engineering, no less. Supposed to be a golden ticket. Instead, it bought me rejection emails and a gnawing sense of failure.

But what stopped me cold was the pay: $55 per hour.

I blinked, wondering if I’d read it wrong. No experience required. Night shift. Immediate start.

It sounded too good to be true—which usually meant it was. But I stood there, heart racing, rereading it like the words might disappear if I looked away. My bank account had dipped below zero three days ago. I’d been living on canned soup and pride.

I looked down at the bottom of the flyer and read the address aloud under my breath:

3921 Old Pine Road, California.

I sighed. New town, no family, no friends—just me, chasing some kind of fresh start in a place that didn’t know my name. It wasn’t ideal. But it was something. A flicker of hope. A paycheck.

By 10 p.m., I was there.

The store wasn’t anything spectacular. In fact, it was a lot smaller than I’d imagined.

“I don’t know why I thought this would be, like, a giant Walmart,” I muttered to myself, taking in the dim, flickering sign saying “Evergroove” and the eerie silence around me. There were no other shops in sight—just a lone building squatting on the side of a near-empty highway, swallowed by darkness on all sides.

It felt more like a rest stop for ghosts than a convenience store.

But I stepped forward anyway. As a woman, I knew the risk of walking into sketchy places alone. Every instinct told me to turn around. But when you’re desperate, even the strangest places can start to look like second chances.

The bell above the door gave a hollow jingle as I walked in. The store was dimly lit, aisles stretching ahead like crooked teeth in a too-wide grin. The reception counter was empty and the cold hit me like a slap.

Freezing.

Why was it so cold in the middle of July?

I rubbed my arms, breath fogging slightly as I looked around. That’s when I heard the soft shuffle of footsteps, followed by a creak.

Someone stepped out from the furthest aisle, his presence sudden and uncanny. A grizzled man with deep lines etched into his face like cracked leather.

“What d’you want?” he grunted, voice gravelly and dry.

“Uh… I saw a sign. Are you guys hiring?”

He stared at me too long. Long enough to make me question if I’d said anything at all.

Then he gave a slow nod and turned his back.

“Follow me,” he said, already turning down the narrow hallway. “Hope you’re not scared of staying alone.”

“I’ve done night shifts before.” I said recalling the call center night shift in high school, then retail during college. I was used to night shifts. They kept me away from home. From shouting matches. From silence I didn’t know how to fill.

The old man moved faster than I expected, his steps brisk and sure, like he didn’t have time to waste.

“This isn’t your average night shift,” he muttered, glancing back at me with a look I couldn’t quite read. Like he was sizing me up… or reconsidering something.

We reached a cramped employee office tucked behind a heavy door. He rummaged through a drawer, pulled out a clipboard, and slapped a yellowed form onto the desk.

“Fill this out,” he said, sliding the clipboard toward me. “If you’re good to start, the shift begins tonight.”

He paused—just long enough that I wondered if he was waiting for me to back out. But I didn’t.

I picked up the pen and skimmed the contract, the paper cold and stiff beneath my fingers. One line snagged my attention like a fishhook, Minimum term: One year. No early termination.

Maybe they didn’t want employees quitting after making a decent paycheck. Still, something about it felt off.

My rent and student loans weighed heavily on my mind. Beggars can’t be choosers and I would need at least six months of steady work just to get a handle on my debts.

But the moment my pen hit the paper, I felt it. A chill—not from the air, but from the room.

Like the store itself was watching me.

The old man didn’t smile or nod welcomingly—just gave me a slow, unreadable nod. Without a word, he took the form and slid it into a filing cabinet that looked like it hadn’t been opened in decades.

“You’ll be alone most of the time,” he said, locking the drawer with a sharp click. “Stock shelves. Watch the front if anyone shows up. The cameras are old, but they work. And read this.”

He handed me a laminated sheet of yellow paper. The title read: Standard Protocols.

I unfolded the sheet carefully, the plastic sticky against my fingers. The list was typed in faded black letters:

*Standard Protocols*

**1) Never enter the basement.**

**2) If you hear footsteps or whispers after midnight, do not respond or investigate.**

**3) Keep all exterior doors except the front door locked at all times—no exceptions.**

**4) Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

**5) If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

**6) Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

**7) Do not use your phone to call anyone inside the store—signals get scrambled.**

**8) If you feel watched, do not turn around or run. Walk calmly to the main office and lock the door until you hear footsteps walk away.**

**9) Under no circumstances touch the old cash register drawer at the front counter.**

**10) If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

I swallowed hard, eyes flicking back up to the old man.

“Serious business,” I said, sarcasm creeping into my voice. “What is this, a hazing ritual?”

He didn’t laugh. Didn’t even blink.

“If you want to live,” he said quietly, locking eyes with me, “then follow the rules.”

With that, he turned and left the office, glancing at his watch. “Your shift starts at 11 and ends at 6. Uniform’s in the back,” he added casually, as if he hadn’t just threatened my life.

I stood alone in the cold, empty store, the silence pressing down on me. The clock on the wall ticked loudly—10:30 p.m. Only thirty minutes until I had to fully commit to whatever this place was.

I headed toward the back room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. The narrow hallway smelled faintly of old wood and something metallic I couldn’t place. When I found the uniform hanging on a rusty hook, I was relieved to see a thick jacket along with the usual store polo and pants.

Slipping into the jacket, I felt a small spark of comfort—like armor against the unknown. But the uneasy feeling didn’t leave. The protocols, the warning, the way the old man looked at me... none of it added up to a normal night shift.

I checked the clock again—10:50 p.m.

Time to face the night.

The first hour passed quietly. Just me, the distant hum of the overhead lights, and the occasional whoosh of cars speeding down the highway outside—none of them stopping. They never did. Not here.

I stocked shelves like I was supposed to. The aisles were narrow and dim, and the inventory was… strange. Too much of one thing, not enough of another. A dozen rows of canned green beans—but barely any bread. No milk. No snacks. No delivery crates in the back, no expiration dates on the labels.

It was like the stock just appeared.

And just as I was placing the last can on the shelf, the lights flickered once.

I paused. Waited. They flickered again.

Then—silence. That kind of thick silence that makes your skin itch.

And within that minute, the third flicker came.

This one lasted longer.

Too long.

The lights buzzed, stuttered, and dipped into full darkness for a breath… then blinked back to life—dim, as if even the store itself was tired. Or… resisting something.

I stood still. Frozen.

I didn’t know what I was waiting for—until I heard it.

A footstep. Just one. Then another. Slow. Heavy. Steady.

They weren’t coming fast, but they were coming.

Closer.

Whoever—or whatever—it was, it wasn’t in a rush. And it wasn’t trying to be quiet either.

My fingers had gone numb around the cart handle.

Rule Five.

**If the lights flicker more than twice in a minute, stop all work immediately and hide until 1 a.m.**

My heartbeat climbed into my throat. I let go of the cart and began backing away, moving as quietly as I could across the scuffed tile.

The aisles around me seemed to shift, shelves towering like skeletons under those flickering lights. Their shadows twisted across the floor, long and jagged, like they could reach out and pull me in.

My eyes searched the store. I needed to hide. Fast.

That’s when the footsteps—once slow and deliberate—broke into a full sprint.

Whatever it was, it had stopped pretending.

I didn’t think. I just ran, heart hammering against my ribs, breath sharp in my throat as I tore down the aisle, desperate for someplace—anyplace—to hide.

The employee office. The door near the stockroom. I remembered it from earlier.

The footsteps were right behind me now—pounding, frantic, inhumanly fast.

I reached the door just as the lights cut out completely.

Pitch black.

I slammed into the wall, palms scraping across rough plaster as I fumbled for the doorknob. 5 full seconds. That’s how long I was blind, vulnerable, exposed—my fingers clawing in the dark while whatever was chasing me gained ground.

I slipped inside the office, slammed the door shut, and turned the lock with a soft, deliberate click.

Darkness swallowed the room.

I didn’t dare turn on my phone’s light. Instead, I crouched low, pressing my back flat against the cold wall, every breath shaking in my chest. My heart thundered like a drumbeat in a silent theater.

I had no idea what time it was. No clue how long I’d have to stay hidden. I didn’t even know what was waiting out there in the dark.

I stayed there, frozen in the dark, listening.

At first, every creak made my chest seize. Every whisper of wind outside the walls sounded like breathing. But after a while... the silence settled.

And somewhere in that suffocating quiet, sleep crept in.

I must’ve dozed off—just for a moment.

Because I woke with a jolt as the overhead lights buzzed and flickered back on, casting a pale glow on the office floor.

I blinked hard, disoriented, then fumbled for my phone.

1:15 a.m.

“Damn it,” I muttered, voice hoarse and cracked.

Whatever the hell was going on in this store… I didn’t want any part of it.

But my train of thought was cut short by a soft ding from the front counter.

The bell.

The reception bell.

“Is anyone there?”

A woman’s voice—gentle, but firm. Too calm for this hour.

I froze, every instinct screaming for me to stay put.

But Rule Four whispered in the back of my mind:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

But it wasn’t 2 a.m. yet. So, against every ounce of better judgment, I pushed myself to my feet, knees stiff, back aching, and slowly crept toward the register.

And that’s when I saw her.

She stood perfectly still at the counter, hands folded neatly in front of her.

Pale as frost. Skin like cracked porcelain pulled from the freezer.

Her hair spilled down in heavy, straight strands—gray and black, striped like static on an old analog screen.

She wore a long, dark coat. Perfectly still. Perfectly pressed.

And she was smiling.

Polite. Measured. Almost mechanical.

But her eyes didn’t smile.

They just stared.

Something about her felt… wrong.

Not in the way people can be strange. In the way things pretend to be people.

She looked human.

Almost.

“Can I help you?” I asked, my voice shakier than I wanted it to be.

Part of me was hoping she wouldn’t answer.

Her smile twitched—just a little.

Too sharp. Too rehearsed.

“Yes,” she said.

The word hung in the air, cold and smooth, like it had been repeated to a mirror one too many times.

“I’m looking for something.”

I hesitated. “What… kind of something?”

She tilted her head—slowly, mechanically—like she wasn’t used to the weight of it.

“Do you guys have meat?” she asked.

The word hit harder than it should’ve.

Meat.

My blood ran cold. “Meat?,” I stammered. My voice thinned with each word.

She didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

Just stared.

“Didn’t you get a new shipment tonight?” she asked. Still calm. Still smiling.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had stocked meat tonight. Not in the aisle—but in the freezer in the back room. Two vacuum-sealed packs. No label. No origin. Just sitting there when I opened the store’s delivery crate…Two silent, shrink-wrapped slabs of something.

And that was all the meat in the entire store.

Just those two.

“Yes,” I said, barely louder than a whisper. “You can find it in the back…in the frozen section.”

She looked at me.

Not for a second. Not for ten.

But for two full minutes.

She didn’t move.

Didn’t blink.

Just stood there, that same polite smile frozen across a face that didn’t breathe… couldn’t breathe.

And then she said it.

“Thank you, Remi.”

My stomach dropped.

I never told her my name and my uniform didn't even have a nameplate.

But before I could react, she turned—slow, mechanical—and began walking down the back hallway.

That’s when I saw them.

Her feet.

They weren’t aligned with her body—angled just slightly toward the entrance, like she’d walked in backward… and never fixed it.

As she walked away—those misaligned feet shuffling against the linoleum—I stayed frozen behind the counter, eyes locked on her until she disappeared into the back hallway.

Silence returned, thick and heavy.

I waited. One second. Then ten. Then a full minute.

No sound. No footsteps. No freezer door opening.

Just silence.

I should’ve stayed behind the counter. I knew I should have. But something pulled at me. Curiosity. Stupidity. A need to know if those meat packs were even still there.

So I moved.

I moved down the hallway, one cautious step at a time.

The overhead lights buzzed softly—no flickering, just a steady, dull hum. Dimmer than before. Almost like they didn’t want to witness what was ahead.

The back room door stood open.

I hesitated at the threshold, heart hammering in my chest. The freezer was closed. Exactly how I’d left it. But she was gone. No trace of her. No footprints. No sound. Then I noticed it—one of the meat packets was missing. My stomach turned. And that’s when I heard it.

Ding. The soft chime of the front door bell. I bolted back toward the front, sneakers slipping on the tile. By the time I reached the counter, the door was already swinging shut with a gentle click. Outside? Empty parking lot. Inside? No one.

She was gone.

And I collapsed.

My knees gave out beneath me as panic took over, my heart pounding so hard I thought it might tear through my chest. My breath came in short gasps. Every instinct screamed Run, escape—get out.

But then I remembered Rule Six:

**Do not exit the premises during your scheduled shift unless explicitly authorized.**

I stared at the front door like it might bite me.

I couldn’t leave.

I was trapped.

My hands were trembling. I needed to regroup—breathe, think. I stumbled to the employee restroom and splashed cold water on my face, hoping it would shock my mind back into something resembling calm.

And that’s when I saw it.

In the mirror—wedged between the glass and the frame—was a folded piece of paper. Just barely sticking out.

I pulled it free and opened it.

Four words. Bold, smeared, urgent:

DONT ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

“What the hell…” I whispered.

I stepped out of the bathroom in a daze, the note still clutched in my hand, and made my way back to the stockroom, trying to focus on something normal. Sorting. Stacking. Anything to distract myself from whatever this was.

That’s when I saw it.

A stairwell.

Half-hidden behind a row of unmarked boxes—steps leading down. The hallway at the bottom stretched into a wide, dark tunnel that ended at a heavy iron door.

I felt my stomach twist.

The basement.

The one from Rule One:

**Never enter the basement.**

I shouldn’t have even looked. But I did. I peeked at the closed door.

And that’s when I heard it.

A voice. Muffled, desperate.

“Let me out…”

Bang.

“Please!” another voice cried, pounding the door from the other side.

Then another. And another.

A rising chorus of fists and pleas. The sound of multiple people screaming—screaming like their souls were on fire. Bloodcurdling, ragged, animalistic.

I turned and ran.

Bolted across the store, sprinting in the opposite direction, away from the basement, away from those voices. The farther I got, the quieter it became.

By the time I reached the far side of the store, it was silent again.

As if no one had ever spoken. As if no one had screamed. As if that door at the bottom of the stairs didn’t exist.

Then the bell at the reception desk rang.

Ding.

I froze.

Rule Four punched through my fog of fear:

**Do not acknowledge or engage with any visitors after 2 a.m. They are not here for the store.**

I slowly turned toward the clock hanging at the center of the store.

2:35 a.m.

Shit.

The bell rang again—harder this time. More impatient. I was directly across the store, hidden behind an aisle, far from the counter.

I crouched low and peeked through a gap between shelves.

And what I saw chilled me to the bone.

It wasn’t a person.

It was a creature—crouched on all fours, nearly six feet tall and hunched. Its skin was hairless, stretched and raw like sun-scorched flesh. Its limbs were too long. Its fingers curled around the edge of the counter like claws.

And its face…

It had no eyes.

Just a gaping, unhinged jaw—so wide I couldn’t tell if it was screaming or simply unable to close.

It turned its head in my direction.

It didn’t need eyes to know.

Then—

The alarm went off.

Rule Ten echoed in my head like a warning bell:

**If the emergency alarm sounds, cease all tasks immediately and remain still. Do not speak. Do not move until the sound stops. And ignore the voice that speaks.**

The sirens wailed through the store—shrill and disorienting. I froze, forcing every muscle in my body to go still. I didn’t even dare to blink.

And then, beneath the screech of the alarm, came the voice.

Low and Crooked. Not human.

“Remi… in Aisle 6… report to the reception.”

The voice repeated it again, warped and mechanical like it was being dragged through static.

“Remi in Aisle 6… come to the desk.”

I didn’t move.

Didn’t breathe.

But my eyes—my traitorous eyes—drifted upward. And what I saw made my stomach drop through the floor.

Aisle 6.

I was in Aisle 6.

The second I realized it, I heard it move.

The thing near the desk snapped its head and launched forward—charging down the store like it had been waiting for this cue. I didn’t wait. I didn't think. Just thought, “Screw this,” and ran.

The sirens only got louder. Harsher. Shadows started slithering out from between shelves, writhing like smoke with claws—reaching, grasping.

Every step I took felt like outrunning death itself.

The creature was behind me now, fast and wild, crashing through displays, howling without a mouth that ever closed. The shadows weren’t far behind—hungry, screaming through the noise.

I turned sharply toward the back hallway, toward the only place left: the stairwell.

I shoved the basement door open and slipped behind it at the last second, flattening myself behind the frame just as the creature skidded through.

It didn’t see me.

It didn’t even hesitate.

It charged down the stairs, dragging the shadows with it into the dark.

I slammed the door shut and twisted the handle.

Click.

It auto-locked. Thank God.

The pounding began immediately.

Fists—or claws—beating against the other side. Screams—inhuman, layered, dozens of voices all at once—rose from beneath the floor like a chorus of the damned.

I collapsed beside the door, chest heaving, soaked in sweat. Every nerve in my body was fried, my thoughts scrambled and spinning.

I sat there for what felt like forever—maybe an hour, maybe more—while the screams continued, until they faded into silence.

Eventually, I dragged myself to the breakroom.

No sirens. No voices. Just the hum of the fridge and the buzz of old lights.

I made myself coffee with shaking hands, not because I needed it—because I didn’t know what else to do.

I stared at the cup like it might offer answers to questions I was too tired—and too scared—to ask.

All I could think was:

God, I hope I never come back.

But even as the thought passed through me, I knew it was a lie.

The contract said one year.

One full year of this madness.

And there was no getting out.

By the time 6 a.m. rolled around, the store had returned to its usual, suffocating quiet—like nothing had ever happened.

Then the bell above the front door jingled.

The old man walked in.

He paused when he saw me sitting in the breakroom. Alive.

“You’re still here?” he asked, genuinely surprised.

I looked up, dead-eyed. “No shit, Sherlock.”

He let out a low chuckle, almost impressed. “Told you it wasn’t your average night shift. But I think this is the first time a newbie has actually made it through the first night.”

“Not an average night shift doesn’t mean you die on the clock, old man,” I muttered.

He brushed off the criticism with a shrug. “You followed the rules. That’s the only reason you’re still breathing.”

I swallowed hard, my voice barely steady. “Can I quit?”

His eyes didn’t even flicker. “Nope. The contract says one year.”

I already knew that but it still stung hearing it out loud.

“But,” he added, casually, “there’s a way out.”

I looked up slowly, wary.

“You can leave early,” he said, “if you get promoted.”

That word stopped me cold.

DON’T ACCEPT THE PROMOTION.

The note in the bathroom flashed through my mind like a warning shot.

“Promotion?” I asked, carefully measuring the word.

“Not many make it that far,” he said, matter-of-fact. No emotion. No concern. Like he was stating the weather.

I didn’t respond. Just stared.

He slid an envelope across the table.

Inside: my paycheck.

$500.

For one night of surviving hell.

“You earned it,” he said, standing. “Uniform rack’ll have your size ready by tonight. See you at eleven.”

Then he walked out. Calm. Routine. Like we’d just finished another late shift at a grocery store.

But nothing about this job was normal.

And if “not many make it to the promotion,” that could only mean one thing.

Most don’t make it at all.

I pocketed the check and stepped out into the pale morning light.

The parking lot was still. Too still.

I walked to my car, every step echoing louder than it should’ve. I slid into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel—knuckles white.

I sat there for a long time, engine off, staring at the rising sun.

Thinking.

Wondering if I’d be stupid enough to come back tomorrow.

And knowing, deep down…

I have a little baby at home and if I thought Ill have some time to read something, chill, play games or some other hobby I was wrong. Im an introvert and I HIGHLY need my time alone.

The problem with taking time off work when you have a family is that since you dont work you have ""free"" time right? it means you can do more things in the house, help with the kids, etc.

What happened is that I could not even have my coffee in peace in the morning but I could do it while working! Im even more burned out taking time off work than being at work, its crazy.

I think when the main provider of the house takes time off its his OWN time off that he EARNED which means that his working hours should be seen as always been as do not interrupt time.

When my wife wants some time off the kids she can ask my in law or her mother to can and help. When I want time off work I cant ask my in law to replace me at work! Which means the only time I can take time off is never...

Thats why I think that if the main provider takes vacation from work it should be his OWN time.

1moetej,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1moetej/moments_of_life/,Moments of life,"Have you ever just had moments in life, where nostalgia creeps in and it brings you back to people of the past? Last night I was thinking about my current lost connection and the heartache I am processing. All of a sudden a wave of sadness crept up, but not from the lost current connect, but a friend of the past. 

Grief comes in many forms, not just romantic relationship breakups. This is something I know well. It has also become very apparent across my life, that people who genuinely understand your mind, who think and problem solve similarly, and share the sense of humor, is not commonly found. It is very infrequent to spend time with another person and have a connection so genuine, that you say the same things at the same time without even trying or knowing you are going to. I had a long-term friend like this and our lives just took us on different paths, into different states. Over time, things shifted and the deep connected once strong, shifted. There is still grief there, and perhaps always will be. 

  
I think back to our long car rides where time would just dissolve while we would ebb and flow from talking about everything and anything, deep or stupid, family drama, or the latest Walmart escapade where something obscenely ridiculous was witnessed and cackled about. Then, it would shift from talking to singing together, and back to talking or vise versa. Large Iced coffee with almond milk and two pumps mocha (I'm missing something, its the part I always would forget, even then, lol.). 

Do you remember the time when we were driving and you said something so stupid that I choked on my drink, swallowed some down the wrong tube, started coughing ferociously while still laughing to the point it was coming out my nose and you said I sounded demonic? Which of course didn't help me pull myself together so we didn't almost die while I was BEHIND the wheel driving. Eye roll X 10,000. XP

I really hope you are doing ok and are living a healthy life now. I really hope you have been able to break free from needing to live in a cultivated reality that feels safe, but isn't truth. I hope you have found peace and self-love. I hope you have broken free from needing to pick everyone apart and shit talk everyone as an escape from facing the pieces of yourself you weren't able to accept back then. It's very early 2000's. You need more love and compassion towards yourself and others. Our world needs that, I need that, YOU need that. 

I loved you as you, all of you as the messy person behind the façade. You know I always knew better, even when you fed me some bullshit information that didn't align in reality right? I have known you since I was 11......seriously navel turd. I know there is a difference in who you actually were and are, versus the person you presented to the world. You also...know meeee toooo......why you even thought I'd believe some of it is amusing. You never needed the masks to be loveable and worthy of being celebrated as you were and are. Just because your dad didn't see the perfections in what he deemed imperfect, didn't mean it was real or true.  I miss you my friend.

1moeq9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1moeq9c/does_the_frigidaire_fppwfu01_purepour_water/,Does the Frigidaire FPPWFU01 PurePour Water Filter Truly Deliver? Review Inside!,"**Detailed Review for Frigidaire FPPWFU01 PurePour PWF-1 Water Filter**

Having personally tested the Frigidaire FPPWFU01 PurePour PWF-1 Water Filter over a period of weeks, I can confidently say it offers some high-performing filtration features but, like anything else on the market, it isn't flawless. This fridge water filter promises cleaner, safer water without the hassle of buying bottled water constantly. I was particularly curious about its ability to remove contaminants and improve water taste, and trust me—I put it through its paces.

**Ease of Installation and Design**

One of the things that stood out for me was just how simple it was to install. Slipping this filter into place was quicker than I expected, even for someone like me who doesn’t exactly have a degree in “appliance tinkering”. The cylindrical black design blends nicely into most refrigerator configurations without feeling bulky. At just 2.3 inches wide and 9.5 inches in height, it doesn’t take up unnecessary space. Plus, weighing only 222 grams, it feels lightweight yet sturdy. I did appreciate that the build quality doesn’t seem compromised despite its minimalistic and functional design.

[Check Frigidaire FPPWFU01 PurePour Water Filter pricing on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08v6jb9r7/)

**Water Filtration Performance**

Another major highlight here is its performance, particularly in reducing contaminants. Frigidaire claims a reduction of up to 99% of impurities, and from my experience, there’s noticeable clarity in the water post-filtration. We sometimes drink municipal tap water, which tends to have a slight chlorine odor. Once filtered, however, that odor was practically gone, leaving refreshingly crisp water. It's NSF and WQA certified, providing some peace of mind that the product is designed with safety standards in mind. My kids didn’t bat an eye anymore when drinking 'plain water.' They even started sipping straight from the glass instead of pouring sodas—which, as you can imagine, pleased me immensely.

**Maintenance and Longevity**

In terms of durability, the manufacturer indicates replacement is needed every six months. During my test period, the filter managed to handle daily use for a family of four without showing signs of clogging. It's worth noting that everything comes down to your water quality and usage intensity, but this longevity felt consistent with other premium refrigerator filters I’ve tried. Replacing it was equally as straightforward as the initial installation—a clear bonus for someone with zero patience when it comes to complicated maintenance routines.

**Advantages**

- Reduces contaminants, including chlorine, by up to 99%.
- Easy installation process that anyone can manage.
- Slim design fits seamlessly into most refrigerator models.
- Promotes healthier drinking habits by improving taste and smell.
- NSF & WQA certifications instill trust in its filtration capabilities.

**Areas for Improvement**

- May feel slightly expensive compared to generic alternatives.
- Doesn’t work universally with all refrigerator brands—make sure to cross-check compatibility.
- Six-month lifespan means you’ll want to stock up on replacements for a year of hassle-free use.

**Daily Use and Real Impressions**

Using it for regular hydration and making coffee or ice cubes has been a game-changer. A personal observation? I noticed fewer deposits in the ice tray, which were once chalky white from unfiltered mineral content. That’s a sign the filter is genuinely doing its job well. However, I loaned one of these filters to a coworker who uses a different fridge model, only to find out it's incompatible with some designs, even those within a similar appliance category. Small letdown there, but nothing that affects its core performance when installed in suitable refrigerators.

**Product Competitors**

I’ve dabbled with other water filters in the past, and PurePour holds its own remarkably well. For instance, compared to GE RPWFE or EveryDrop filters, this one edges out with a slightly better ease-of-use factor in installation. The PurePour's certifications also nudge it ahead in terms of safety reassurances. On the flip side, some competing brands might last an additional month or so before needing replacement, which is mildly frustrating since you’re paying a premium price. Overall, those who prioritize taste and contaminant removal over filter lifespan will likely find it a good fit.

**Value for Money**

The cost-effectiveness of the filter depends largely on how you value drinking safely filtered water. I wouldn’t call it the most budget-friendly option around, but for households focusing on health or aiming to cut down on bottled water expenses, it’s a good investment. Even with its six-month replacement cycle, the better-tasting water makes each dollar feel well-spent. Still, for thrifty shoppers, the occasional deals online make this product worth hunting down.

1moely4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1moely4,Long term look at the Dreame L40s Ultra CE – strong performance for the price,"(Full disclosure: I work for Dreame at our Century City location, and I have been testing this unit myself to see how it holds up over time.)

I have been using the Dreame L40s Ultra CE for a while now and wanted to share a detailed breakdown for anyone considering it. While it is positioned as one of Dreame’s more budget friendly models, it borrows a surprising number of features from the higher end lineup.

Setup and design
Setup was straightforward. The app pairing worked right away and mapping was completed in a single run. It allowed me to define rooms, set custom cleaning zones, and tweak things like suction power and mop intensity. The robot itself feels sturdy, and the base station handles dustbin emptying, mop washing, drying, and water refilling without extra input.

Vacuum performance
The L40s Ultra CE has up to 13,000Pa suction and uses a TriCut brush that actively cuts and lifts tangled hair. In my tests with debris like coffee grounds and oats on both hard floors and rugs, pickup was consistent and thorough. The side brush also does a good job at pulling dirt away from edges.

Mopping system
It uses two rotating mop pads with good downward pressure. A standout feature is RoboSwing, which swings the rear section outward to reach wall edges and corners better. It also lifts the mops on carpet to avoid damp spots. Unlike some higher end Dreame models, it does not use hot water for mop washing, but it does dry the pads with heated air to help prevent odor.

Navigation and obstacle handling
The navigation system combines 3D structured light with LiDAR. It has done well avoiding small obstacles and has not gotten stuck under furniture. It supports multi floor mapping for up to four floors, and you can view its path live in the app.

Battery and runtime
With its 5,200mAh battery, I can run it for just over four hours on Quiet mode before it needs a recharge. Charging is also faster than some earlier Dreame models I have tested.

Final thoughts
The L40s Ultra CE offers strong cleaning ability, thoughtful features, and good obstacle handling for its price point. While it is missing a few premium touches from flagship units, it has been more than capable for day to day cleaning in spaces with pets and mixed flooring.

For reference, our Century City store currently has it at $599.99 (MSRP is $899.99), with two 1L bottles of cleaning solution included for a limited time. Price may change depending on availability.

I can see the benefits of warding off unnecessary questions. I can also see how some might argue that it's another way for students to not read (my coffee has still not hit and I am having trouble expressing myself but I hope that last sentence made sense).

For those just tuning in — Virtu Financial, *yes, THAT Virtu*, one of the biggest market-making, HFT-loving, PFOF-slurping players in the game, is looking **real sus** right now. And it’s not just because they’ve been caught in some spicy legal drama before… this time it’s because the cracks are showing **right in the middle of peak volatility season**.  

Here’s the tea:  
- Whispers of *liquidity issues* have been floating around faster than a Citadel intern on a coffee run.  
- Their trading volume dominance is being questioned, and that’s basically their whole shtick. If the algo gods aren’t smiling on Virtu, that’s like McDonald’s running out of fries.  
- Regulators? Oh, they’re sniffing around. And you know when the SEC, CFTC, AND state AGs all get curious at the same time, something’s rotting in the dark pool.  
- If you think this doesn’t connect to $GME, you’re adorable — these guys are part of the same plumbing that the hedgie clowns rely on to suppress price and churn that sweet sweet FTD churn butter.  

So… are we looking at **Virtu’s “Archegos moment”**? Is this the first domino in the market maker chain wobbling before MOASS kicks off? Or is it just a little “technical glitch” that just happens to benefit short positions? 🤔  

Either way — apes don’t forget: **They need our shares. We don’t need theirs.**  
💎🙌 **NO SELL. NO CELL.** 🙌💎  

**Buckle up.** If Virtu starts spiraling, it could rip a hole in the liquidity web that’s been holding this whole clown market together. And when that web snaps? Kenny’s mayo jar isn’t gonna be big enough to hide in.

1moefmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1moefmz/im_in_my_late_twenties_but_im_dying_of_old_age/,"I'm in my late twenties, but I'm dying of old age...","It was my last night south of the Rio Grande. I’d taken off a few days of work to attend my friend Juan’s wedding. It was a nice time. But sad, too. After the bells finished ringing, after the rice was scattered and the bride’s bouquet thrown, Juan was going to stay in his home country and run his father’s copper factory.

Every wedding happens in the season of last hurrahs.

“Listen, it’s not like you can’t come back and visit sometime.” I didn’t know the woman who was talking to me very well. But I knew her well enough: Maggie. We’d just kept running into eachother in the hotel lobby bar. Each night we’d end up drinking curtain call cocktails before I dragged myself back to my room and off to sleep. She was probably fifty years older than me. It was the sort of strange, temporary friendship native to resort properties. “This is just life, darling,” she said. “This is the next stage of life.”

“I don’t know, Mags,” I said. “Everyone’s getting married, everyone’s getting married. Everyone except for me.”

She was tall and thin, and even in the swelter of the Yucatán, her silver-white hair kept near-perfect. “Don’t you want to get married someday?”

“I’m ambivalent. Tell me, how did you like it?” I said.

“I can tell you this much,” she leaned back into her barstool’s back as she crossed her legs, “I’ve been married four times, so I’m rather good at it.”

I laughed. But my laughter made me no less sad. Maggie could tell, I was sure.

She patted my shoulder like those little league coaches who believe in trophies for losers. “You’re going to be alright, Sam.”

“I just kind of wish everyone was at the same stage of their life. Me and all my friends. It’s these liminal periods—some people getting married, some with kids already, some who’ve sworn off ever having kids. I don’t fit in with any of them.”

“The old ‘neither fish nor foul’ conundrum.”

“I guess.”

“You know—” Maggie fished around in her handbag. It was understated, but “HERMÈS | PARIS | MADE IN FRANCE” was stamped above the twist clasp “—that peddler on the beach today. He was selling amulets—”

I raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?” 

“He gave me this one.” She pulled a bronze coin the size of a silver dollar out of her purse. It had a hole drilled through the top of the coin and a red ribbon tied right through it. She handed it to me.

“What did he say it’s for?” I asked.

Maggie shrugged. “He said it was for good luck in love. Though I can count on one hand the totems that don’t make the same claim. Love’s the eternal promise we all want to rely on. Like a lucky rabbit’s foot on a gambler’s keychain.”

I looked at the coin’s relief. It showed a bearded, naked old man holding a scythe. The old man was standing inside a wheel with symbols all around it. Above the relief, there was Greek text: “Χρόνος”. Except it was upside down. I didn’t know Greek, but I’d taken enough humanities courses to know the letters weren’t facing the way they were supposed to. 

“Why’s it in Greek and not Spanish?”

Maggie shrugged. “It’s probably a drachma some Athenian tourist dropped in a mariachi’s upturned hat. I’m sure the peddler was the last stop on the path of a thousand cash registers. He probably dressed it up so other tourists thought there was some mystical Mayan hoodoo to it.”

“Why’d you buy it, if it’s a scam?”

“I don’t think it’s a scam. I never said it was a scam. I think it’s a story. Here,” she said, handing it to me. “You keep it. It’ll make you think of beaches scattered with white sand, conquistadors and vaqueros, a tequila sunrise; and kindly old divorcées, of course.”

I smiled and put it in my pocket. “Thanks Mags.”

“Think nothing of it. You’re a good boy, Sam. Now, I’m about to turn into a pumpkin. So give old Mother Maggie a squeeze before I’m off to Bedfordshire. We'll likely never see one another again.”

I hugged her. “Don’t say things like that. Even if they’re true.”

“Darling, I’m too old to lie,” she said as she dismounted her barstool, using my arm to steady herself. “It’s a luxury of getting old: I can indulge myself in that indecorous breach of manners called ‘honesty’.”

“It’s been a pleasure, Mags. I’ll always remember you.”

“Oh, I know you will, Sam. I know you will.”

I didn’t think about it then, but it was sort of strange for her to say it like that.

Lots of things make more sense looking back. 

•

On the flight home, there was a group of elderly tourists, almost all of them wearing crucifixes. They filled up half the airplane. A church group, probably. I was seated next to one of these white-haired born-agains up in first class.

“You know, you remind me of my nephew. He runs a very successful HVAC company. Do you do ductwork?”

“Actually, I’m in sales,” I said.

“Oh. HVAC sales?”

“No, ma’am. Non-fungible tokens.”

“Well, I’m not sure I know what that is.”

“That’s alright, nobody does. I don’t either.”

She chuckled. “Oh, you really are like my nephew. He’s cheeky, too.”

“I’ve been called worse.”

They turned down the lights and closed the cabin window shades right after drink service. My neighbor fell asleep right away, and soon I started to drift away, too. I worried Maggie’s amulet between my fingers and thumb as I drifted. My eyelids grew heavy. I fell asleep with the coin in my hand.

•

I woke up. My elderly seatmate was staring at me. She had just about one of the nastiest looks I’d ever seen on a human being’s face. It was a hellacious stink eye; the look of hatred that comes from the bowels, a malice otherwise reserved for family court custody battles.

I rubbed sleep from my eyes and pulled up in my chair. “Ma’am, are you okay?”

She sneered at me. “Everybody knows that you’re a liar,” she said. “And a cunt.”

“Excuse me?”

“I think you should eat shit. Do you hear me, cocksucker? I think you should eat shit!” She scratched my face so hard I could hear the streaks of flesh come off under her nails. The smell and texture of blood freshly coated my face. I looked at her—I was stunned beyond comprehension.

The nice little old church lady shrieked like a carnivore. “You’re the one who took him,” she said, spitting at my bloodied face. She took her purse and walloped me right on the nose, splashing some of my blood on her lips and cheeks. I could see blood on her teeth, too, coloring her mad snarl red. “You lying piece of shit!” She fumbled at me with her thumbs, trying to gouge my eyes out. “Killer-cocksucker-killer!” I put my hands up to defend myself and she tried to bite my fingers. “You’re the one who took my husband. You murdering cunt!”

The flight attendants and someone else from her church group rushed towards us and immediately restrained her. 

I switched spots with another born-again who was in a single seat across the aisle.

“Oh, sir! Don’t forget your—your thing.” The flight attendant picked up the amulet and handed it to me; it glimmered as she placed it in my palm. As the coin changed hands, every single churchgoing grandparent looked at me like I was the actual, historical killer of Christ Jesus on earth.

I tucked the amulet into the coin pocket of my wallet. As soon as I did, every elderly Christian fell back into saintly serenity.

And once I’d put it away, I just about forgot it was there.

•

The next day I woke up much earlier than I should have. My clock radio showed five a.m., a good two hours before my alarm called Reveille.

It was a little annoying that I couldn’t get back to sleep. But I figured I’d read the yet-unread novel I’d bought in the airport. When I cracked the spine and started in on it, though, I could hardly make out the words. It was like reading the bottom row of the eye exam the DMV gives new licensees.

I watched the news instead. But it felt like there was cotton in my ears. I had to turn the volume up so high that it wasn’t worth the anxiety I had over bothering my neighbors. I turned off the TV.

I gave up on spending my early bird hours on self-enrichment. Instead, I showered, got dressed, and grabbed my wallet, keys and phone. I headed to the office.

•

I didn’t feel so hot most of the day. I couldn’t eat more than half a banana for lunch. My afternoon slump felt more like drought or famine. My body screamed for a nap.

I dragged myself to the bathroom to splash water on my face.

I inspected my wet face in the mirror and winced at the sight of it. I looked godawful. The little bit of salt that dusted the pepper in my hair had turned into two whole salt licks on the side of my head. There were veins bulging through toadish bags under my eyes. There were sunspots on my skin I’d somehow missed before. I looked…

Old.

Chip, my boss, came out of one of the stalls and started washing his hands in the sink to my left. He kept sneaking looks at me through the wall-wide mirror behind the sink.

“What?” I said.

“Sam, I don’t want to sound like a dick, but…you really look terrible, man. Are you coming down with something?”

“I—I don’t think so, no.”

“How are you feeling?” Chip said. “Right now, I mean.”

“Right now?”

“Yeah.”

“I mean, I’m a little fatigued, I guess,” I said.

Chip tugged a few sheets of paper towel from the dispenser and wrung his hands in them. “Buddy, don’t take this the wrong way, but you look like you slept inside a cardboard box last night. Maybe you have a virus. I think you ought to take a sick day. Maybe sleep through the weekend, just come back fresh next Monday.”

“But I was off more than half of the week already. I just got back.”

Chip frowned. “Listen, man. It’s not a suggestion. You look like hammered shit. Go home and come back on Monday. I don’t want people to see you in the office. Christ, Sam, you look like a corpse.”

•

It was a busy corner. On one end there was the dark tide of mourners—pallbearers in black suits bought off the rack, the padre with his surplice and stole, women in sensible pumps or Mary Janes, their hems below the knee; the good modesty that attends to obsequies. Across the street there was a bum with a cardboard sign reading: “NEED MONEY FOR PENIS REDUCTION SURGERY”. Children on a field trip were tethered to each other on a safety rope with two-dozen rungs, like baby sloths clinging to their mama under the rainforest canopy. 

“Change!” The vagrant saving up for his urologic surgical procedure called out with the self-satisfaction of a man who can still smirk even while living in a sleeping bag on a public sidewalk.

I pulled the amulet out to start worrying it again. Or maybe I thought I was going to flick it into the bum’s empty coffee canister.

Looking back, I wonder why I didn’t think of the amulet. Should I have known? Could I have known? Mags was such a sweet, old lady, after all…

Someone called out from inside the shadow of the church. “He’s the one who killed him. Look at him, he’s the one who did it!”

I searched for the screamer and who they were screaming at. The stream of mourners clogged the church steps. Everyone old enough to collect Social Security stared at me like they’d caught me letting my dog shit on their lawn. I could see (and feel, too) every old-timer boiling over with unaccountable fury.

People started yelling at me from the church entrance: “Piece of shit” and “murderer”, “Judas” and “abomination”; and of course, the ubiquitous “cocksucker”. They called me every name in the book.

I didn’t know what the first congregant’s intention was when I saw him step out into traffic. Two more mourners followed and blocked the uptown flow. Workaday humps hollered from their box trucks. A village of cabbies started riding their horns. 

The mourners stopping traffic as they crossed the street all had more people drafting behind them. A human tide of grandparenthood gray and funereal black surged angry across the street, indifferent to gridlock and pedestrian traffic offenses.

I finally realized: They were yelling at me. And they were angry enough to block the whole street. To look at their faces, half the funeral’s attendees wanted to wring my sorry neck.

I turned and I ran, clutching the amulet.

I think of that moment and wonder why I didn’t drop it. Maybe I didn’t know what it was yet. Or maybe it kept me from knowing so what happened would be sure to happen.

My heart was machine-gunning in my chest and my lungs were on fire. I reached my sixth city block in a row of straight sprinting. 

A box truck pulled around a loading dock wall. It was right in my path, right in my blind spot. Its rear end clipped my side. I spun. I tried to stay upright, to keep running, but the momentum carried me into a cartwheel. I lifted off my feet. I bowling-balled across the pavement, scoring my face and hands with roadrash.

The tumbling heap of my body rolled to a stop. I heard near-silence with a faint ringtone beneath it, like I’d been concussed. I reached up and touched my head. It was bleeding. I didn’t know where I was busted open, where the blood came from, exactly. I just knew I was bleeding.

I turned just as the first mourner caught up with me. His mirror-shiny black shoe caught me in my teeth. There was a white-black flash as my brain rattled inside my skull. 

“Sto—” I started but was stopped from finishing. Another man punched me in the lip hard enough to split it—I heard one of his fingers break against my teeth. His finger crunched as he howled in pain.

I was dazed and down on my back. I looked up. I saw the priest in his funereal vestments, swinging something at the end of a gold chain. He lassoed a heavy, metal object over his head. And then he brought it right down into my skull.

When I woke up two weeks later, I would learn that what he’d hit me with was called a “censer”.

•

I opened my eyes and saw the world swimming around me. My nerves were chicken-fried with pain; bruises and gashes like they’d been boiled in oil. And it didn’t just hurt where I’d been beaten on my body. It was my bones that ached, too, right down to the marrow. I could feel my veins constricting, like there were tiny rubber bands squeezing every bloody branch.

The world was slow to come into focus.

There was something in my mouth. I touched it—rigid plastic giving way to a more pliant polyethylene. I pinched my nose and felt another rubbery tube.

I panicked. I moved to extubate myself, to yank the foreign object out of my trachea. But my wrists were velcroed inside cushioned restraints.

“Try not to jerk yourself around so much. You’re still healing.” It was a female voice.

I saw a young woman who I was sure I’d never seen before but who seemed very familiar.

Who the hell are you? Where the hell am I? I thought but couldn’t say with the tube in my throat. Instead, I made a sound like a lowing cow.

“They really worked you over,” she said through a haze of cigarette smoke. “Usually it takes longer before the geriatrics can smell him on you. You must be special.”

Tall, natural ice-blonde with Scandinavian skin like heavy cream and eyes the color of glacial ice. A mini dress hugged her body like something from Hervé Léger, nipples apexed from the center of breasts immune to gravity and screaming through her bustline. She had a tennis pro’s legs. I could see the outline of ribs along her sides and felt the stupid lust that only lonely men can feel.

Her voice exuded an easy superiority, the self-possession of someone who’d been beautiful from the cradle and was likely to stay a stunner almost all the way to the grave. 

“Still a little foggy?” she said. She held up the coin that Mother Maggie gave me before we said our goodbyes at the edge of the Yucatán, a lightning bolt glimmer of gold reflected over her eyes. “Don’t worry, I’m not repoing your amulet. I just…” She lost the thread before picking it back up. “Well, I’m nostalgic, I suppose. This twinkling little disk took me on quite the rollercoaster ride. I shined you on, as I guess you might know by now. And I suppose you’ll have figured out that this isn’t a drachma. And that I didn’t barter it away from a rag-and-bone man hawking wares on the beach.”

It took a minute for my brain to work it out. She knew where the amulet came from. She knew it was a gift to me.

I knew this woman.

I saw it in my mind, like a transparency laid one on top of the other, lighting a whiteboard through a science class projector: Maggie’s face and this woman’s face—the Greek nose, Snow Queen eyes, ears a touch too big for her skull. It was the same face, except that one had been through a near-century more of rainy days.

Maggie saw the realization I came to, saw it in my face, saw my reaction before I myself realized what I was reacting to: I was looking at Maggie; and she was young.

She laughed with the natural cruelty of a sultress. “Yes, darling. I suppose I lied when I said we’d likely never see one another again. But forget all that, I don’t have much time. Frankly, none of us have enough time. Which is why I borrowed some of yours.”

I groaned but couldn’t make any real noise. I bucked against my restraints. 

Maggie glided cooly toward the IV bag with its line running into my arm. She injected something into the pouch. I fell into a dark softness.

“Ah, better. That’s much, much better, darling.” She sat back down to luxuriate in her cigarette smoke. “So here’s how it goes, Sam. You are now on Chronos’s time. And the big man works in billable hours. If you can get someone else to pick up the check, as you picked up mine (and thank you for that), you’ll always look twenty-five years old and live for as many generations. But if not…” She tapped her wristwatch. “Tick-tock, tick-tock. The more time goes by, the riper Chronos’s scent on your soul. And the oldsters quite easily catch the scent. It maddens them. Makes them want to stamp eternity’s stink out of you. People who are nearing the end of their lifespan are not fans of Father Time. That’s why anyone with gray hair has been trying to kill you. See? They can smell his malediction oozing through your pores.”

She smiled. I saw the predator of her true nature lurk behind her eyes. My eyes felt hot and wet; the wet heat stung the still-healing abrasions covering my face. I realized I was crying.

An emergency code alert went off. Maggie turned over the back of her chair and looked through the blinds of my room’s glass window. A flock of physicians and nurses flew across the ward. 

“There goes another one turning early off the turnpike. Must’ve been hard up for the toll,” she said, turning back to face me again. An Irish waterfall of blue-gray smoke flumed from her nose to her mouth. She sucked it down and blew back out a perfect ring. “Sam…my advice? Find someone else to take your place. Get yourself a patsy and foist the amulet off on them. You know what they say, ‘Shit rolls downhill.’”

Maggie stood up from her chair and dropped her cigarette on the floor before stubbing it out with the toe of her stiletto. “You can make yourself young again, and you can stay young,” she said, turning the amulet in her hand as she walked to my bedside. “But Father Time isn’t very keen on debt forgiveness, so don’t wait too long before you get started.” She winked at me and flicked the coin, sent it spinning through the air before it landed on my chest. “It’s lovely to see you again, Sam. And if it’s any consolation, I really do like you. If you make it into eternity with the rest of us, go ahead and look me up.”

Maggie turned to leave my room but stopped at the threshold. “I almost forgot.” She turned on her heels and came back to my bedside, then fished a compact mirror from her purse. She clicked it open and said, “Just a teensy-weensy little looksie, Sam; a little flare under your derrière. Remember, what you see is only the beginning. So shake a leg and find your fall guy.” She laughed that cruel laugh. “Or gal.”

She held the compact mirror in front of my face. If I’d been able to, I would have screamed. I looked at least ninety years old.

1moef3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/GlitchPicks/comments/1moef3n/reveal_the_best_gaming_keyboard_kiiboom_phantom/,Reveal the Best Gaming Keyboard KiiBoom Phantom 68 Worth It or Not,"Testing out the KiiBoom Phantom 68 daily was quite the treat as someone who appreciates compact keyboards with big features. At first glance, its unique transparent acrylic design caught my attention—it’s a compact 65% layout keyboard that’s anything but ordinary. The sophisticated look was a winner on my desk, but the true magic unfolded when I dove into its features. Its amazing balance between style, functionality, and customizability made me strangely attached to it, though not without uncovering some quirks. 

**Sleek Transparent Design**

As someone who appreciates aesthetic gear, I couldn’t help but admire the Phantom 68’s crystal-clear construction. It doesn’t just look cool—it screams innovation. The delicate blend of transparency and durability feels premium, and the additional poron foam layers add an unexpected acoustic delight. Typing on this keyboard is an oddly satisfying sensory experience. The smooth, unique feel of the blushing pink version I tried out was the ultimate desk flex. Its charm is hard to ignore, earning compliments from coworkers and even a gasp from my design-nerd roommate.  

**Perfect for Compact Keyboard Fans**

I’ve tested numerous mechanical keyboards, and the 65% layout on this one is exactly what I needed to clear up desk clutter. With just 68 keys, it feels compact without losing essential functionality, making it ideal for gaming, daily work, or cramming it into a backpack. Convenient isn’t just a buzzword here; it’s the name of the game. For anyone working with small desk spaces (my cramped little corner testifies to that), this keyboard makes it work. I did miss dedicated function keys in the first few days, but once I got used to alternate key mappings, it felt just right.

**Customizable Crystal Mechanical Switches**

Speaking of upgrades, the pre-lubed Crystal Switches didn't just look stunning; they performed beautifully. They’re smooth, slightly quieter than other linear switches I’ve used, and definitely precise, which is a win for gaming enthusiasts. I introduced the Phantom 68 to one of my gamer friends who’s picky about keystroke precision, and they were genuinely impressed. Typing for hours doesn’t feel like a chore anymore, and let’s just say, smashing through emails became a borderline guilty pleasure.

**Connectivity Features that Leave No One Behind**

Rarely have I come across a keyboard that seamlessly connects to three devices via Bluetooth, a USB Type-C cable, or a USB dongle—yet the Phantom 68 made it feel effortless. I tested quick-switching between my MacBook, Android phone, and a gaming PC, and the process was remarkably smooth. Working and scrolling through devices while sipping coffee made me feel more efficient than I probably was. Plus, that chunky 4000mAh battery? It goes on forever, so I didn’t have to charge it mid-project. 

**Programmable RGB and Software Integrations**

The south-facing RGB lighting is every setup's dream—customizable, vibrant, and with over 19 lighting presets. My favorite? The dynamic wave effect that feels like a mini light show on your desk. It even synced well with my setup, adding a touch of personality. Software programming here is icing on the cake, giving me control over macros and personalizing RGB patterns. I could switch between pre-set profiles effortlessly, which felt like embracing tech wizardry without actually needing a magic wand.

**Highlights**

- Compact 65% layout saves desk space without sacrificing essential functionality.
- Transparent acrylic design with poron foam layers elevates aesthetics and acoustics.
- Pre-lubed Crystal Switches deliver quiet yet precise keystrokes.
- Multi-device connectivity caters to Bluetooth, USB-C, and 2.4GHz users.
- Built-in 4000mAh battery ensures longer play and work sessions.

**Shortcomings**

- Lack of dedicated function keys could be a hurdle for heavy multitaskers.
- Some might find the software's user interface a tad intimidating at first.
- Acrylic material may require extra care to avoid scuffs and fingerprints.  

**Competing Products**

This keyboard entered my collection stacked against serious contenders like the Keychron K6 and the Logitech G Pro X. The Keychron K6 is known for versatility with a slight edge of affordability. However, the Phantom 68 steals the show when it comes to style. Compared to the Logitech G Pro X, which focuses on gaming-specific features, the Phantom 68 is more of an all-rounder. Those gorgeous RGB lights and gasket-mounted design make it stand out in any crowd. While both competitors have plenty of charms, the Phantom 68’s customization options, especially in its hot-swappable switches, give it a distinct edge.

**Affordable Quality**

For anyone willing to invest in style and functionality, this keyboard brings reasonable quality for its price point. Although it holds its own against pricier alternatives, the customization and aesthetics make it worth considering. It borders on premium, especially if you’re a creative professional or gamer looking to combine beauty with brawn. Budget may sway your choice, but I’d argue this one leaves you feeling pampered.

1moee5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1moee5l/should_you_buy_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_ninja/,Should You Buy the Best Drip Coffee Maker Ninja CM300 Today,"The Ninja CM300 coffee system has been a pleasant addition to my mornings and late-night coffee cravings. Balancing both function and form, it caters to every caffeine enthusiast, be it casual coffee drinkers who enjoy an iced delight or die-hard fans of a bold, steaming brew. This review dives into my personal experiences with the product and a closer look at what it can—and can’t—offer.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was its sleek black aesthetic, complemented by stainless steel accents. It looks modern and fits perfectly on my countertop without feeling bulky. With dimensions of 12""D x 8.75""W x 15""H, it doesn’t devour precious counter space, which is a win in a small kitchen like mine. The removable water reservoir is a thoughtful addition; I didn't realize how much of a pain refilling traditional coffee makers was until I swapped over. With this design, there’s no annoying risk of spilling water all over the machine or countertop.

**Features That Stand Out**  
What really sold the system to me is its versatility. Whether I'm brewing just a single hot cup or prepping a larger 10-cup carafe for guests, it handles both with ease. It comes with three different brew styles—Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. And let me say, that Over Ice option has been a game changer on summer afternoons. Iced coffee lovers, rejoice: it delivers authentic flavor without the watered-down taste, thanks to its special preparation mode. I even ran a little taste test comparing the iced coffee to café versions, and while opinions varied, everyone agreed it hung right up there with the best.  

[Check Ninja CM300 price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b09xy4h285/)

**Advantages**  
- Brew versatility with six size options, ranging from a single cup to a full carafe.  
- Adjustable warming plate keeps brewed coffee hot for up to four hours.  
- Fully automatic operation mode removes any complexity, ensuring zero fuss mornings.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The glass carafe, while sleek and functional, feels a bit delicate. I’ve already been extra cautious while handling it.  
- It doesn’t come with a double-sided scoop, though replacing it isn’t a huge hassle.  
- A few clock-setting features feel outdated, especially for a machine with so many modern perks.  

**Performance in Daily Use**  
Operating this coffee maker is a breeze. Its control panel is intuitive, which is particularly helpful on groggy mornings. The brewing time is impressively short, delivering my coffee quickly without compromising flavor. Iced coffee mode, though perfect for taste, takes slightly longer, but the payoff is well worth it. It’s also surprisingly quiet during operation, unlike my older machine, which sounded like I was starting a small lawnmower each morning.

**Pros of the Ninja CM300 Coffee System**  
- Flexible settings adapt to various preferences, making it suitable for a wide audience.  
- The removable reservoir simplifies cleaning and refilling, reducing the chance of spills.  
- A rich and robust brew, especially noticeable in the Rich setting.  

**Cons of the Coffee Maker**  
- It’s not the lightest coffee maker out there (weighing slightly over 10 pounds), so moving it frequently isn’t ideal.  
- Some users might miss pod compatibility. While reusable filters are great for the environment, pod devotees may need to adjust.  

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it against other popular coffee makers like the Keurig or Breville models, the Ninja CM300 fares well, especially in terms of versatility. Keurig machines are undeniably convenient but often rely on pods, which can limit experimentation with blends. Breville’s premium options might deliver on looks and niche performance details, but often at a much heftier price point. For anyone wanting a no-pod, highly customizable, and fairly priced coffee system, this is arguably a better choice. However, it doesn’t fully replace specialty high-end espresso machines if that’s your primary coffee type.  

**Money’s Worth**  
The Ninja CM300 strikes a fine balance between feature set and affordability. I appreciated how I didn’t feel like I needed to compromise my love for well-brewed coffee for the sake of versatility. This coffee system pivots seamlessly between brewing a quick single cup, a travel mug for the road, or a delightful iced drink for those hot afternoons. Considering its long list of features and solid day-to-day performance, plus the durability evident in its build, it delivers excellent financial value.

So I know medication is needed as I have done all the lifestyle stuff (with research on my own as doctor said nothing) elevated sleeping stop eating 3 hr min before bed, no coffee 😭, I have cut almost all seasoning and condiments and eating lower fat intake. 

Im miserable. Food sucks..I don’t want to loose weight I tried so hard to finally gain weight last year and don’t want to be 100 lbs again.

Hi! My boyfriend and I are both almost 30, dual income (over $250k combined), and looking to rent for now. He works fully remote, and I’d be in an office in downtown SD. We currently live in Charlotte but are originally from NJ/NYC.

We recently visited San Diego and loved it – the weather, outdoor lifestyle, farmers markets, culture (my boyfriend is Turkish and now a U.S. citizen), the food, the beach, and the mountains. We know it’s more expensive than Charlotte, but we could comfortably rent a one-bedroom in Little Italy, which we loved for its walkability.

I’d like to be within a 20-minute commute to downtown. So far, we liked Little Italy, North Park, and South Park. We’re social and active but a little worried about making friends after moving. Walkability to gyms, yoga, coffee shops, and restaurants is a big plus for us. We did feel that we could do LI, make friends and then move to NP. 

My questions:
	1.	Are people in San Diego open to making new friends in their late 20s?
	2.	What neighborhoods would you recommend for dual-income, no-kids couples in this age range?
	3.	If you moved to San Diego, was it worth it for you?

Any thoughts, personal experiences, or suggestions would be super helpful. Thank you in advance!",0,1755018016.0,Moving2SanDiego,27,0.36,False

1moe98r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1moe98r/uncover_if_the_best_coffee_maker_by_cuisinart/,Uncover if the best coffee maker by Cuisinart lives up to the hype,"The Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS is a product I've been using daily for some time, blending perfectly into my caffeine-fueled life. As someone who lives and breathes coffee—whether it’s pulling a quick espresso shot on a rushed morning or savoring drip coffee on a slow afternoon—this machine has both strengths and quirks that make it stand out. The sheer versatility it claims to have was the first thing that grabbed my attention. A gadget that does it all? Naturally, I was intrigued.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker was clearly crafted with modern kitchens in mind. Its sleek black finish looks fantastic on a counter, not taking up much more space than a standard coffee maker, although its dimensions might feel slightly bulky if you're tight on kitchen real estate. The 11.88"" x 12.88"" x 16.75"" size accommodates the dual functionality of a drip and single-serve brewer, which, honestly, I found to be worth every inch. The solid exterior and ergonomic button placement make daily use smooth, and the machine feels robust enough to handle frequent use without tipping over or wobbling around. However, I did find the design a bit of a fingerprint magnet, so if you’re picky about keeping surfaces immaculate (like me), you might want to keep cleaning cloths nearby.

**Functionality and Versatility**  
This machine thrives in offering variety. Brewing 12 cups of coffee is effortless with the drip option, and the programmability feature is something I didn’t know I needed until I owned it. Setting the machine to brew in the morning before my alarm blares has been a game-changer for non-coffee morning zombies like myself. With brew strength adjustment, I was able to toggle between a mild flavor profile for guests and a strong, heady brew when deadlines loomed. The reusable filter for drip brewing eliminates the need for paper ones, which is both convenient and environmentally friendly.  

Switching to the single-serve function was another highlight. Whether it’s a 6 oz., 8 oz., or 10 oz. size, the compatibility with single-serve pods like Keurig K-Cups made it incredibly easy to dive into an ocean of flavor options without the long brewing time. On top of that, the Nespresso OriginalLine capsule compatibility was a pleasant surprise for espresso lovers. Finally, the steam wand adds the café vibe, letting me froth milk for lattes that taste pretty close to what the pros whip up. I even use the wand for hot water to prepare tea or instant oatmeal when multitasking in the kitchen.

**[Check Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b0bwsmv57f/)**

**Positives**  
- Intuitive controls and seamless programmability  
- Versatility: drip brewing, single-serve pods, and espresso capsules  
- Powerful steam wand for milk frothing and hot water functions  
- Sleek modern design that enhances aesthetic appeal  
- Built-in gold-tone permanent filter eliminates paper filter dependency  

**Performance Assessment**  
Performance is where this coffee maker mostly thrives. Each brewing method—be it drip coffee, single-serve, or espresso—delivers a solid cup. Drip coffee brewed evenly, and the adjustable Brew Pause feature is a bonus enabling you to pour mid-brew. The single-serve aspect performed consistently well, with the machine quickly adjusting sizes while brewing at the ideal temperature.  

That said, the one area where I felt it stumbled a little was with the espresso capsule. They claim compatibility with the Nespresso OriginalLine capsules, and while they do work, I noticed crema wasn’t as thick or rich as you’d expect from a standalone Nespresso machine. Additionally, the wand, though excellent for frothing, requires practice to fully master the art.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The machine’s brewing speed on the drip side felt a tad slow, especially during larger 12-cup batches.  
- Cleaning components, particularly the frothing wand, can be tedious for regular use.  
- Espresso output lacks the richness found in sole-purpose machines.  
- The machine takes up significant counter space, which might not suit compact kitchens.  

**Other Options**  
Competing products in the market, such as the Keurig K-Café, offer comparable functionalities, like single-serve brewing and milk frothing, but without the 12-cup drip coffee addition. That’s where this coffee maker wins—it effectively merges two different machines into one. On the other hand, dedicated espresso machines, like the Breville Bambino, surpass its espresso quality by miles but don’t provide the multi-use versatility. I also looked into Ninja’s specialty coffee makers, which combine drip and single-serve options but miss out on Nespresso compatibility. In essence, this machine is ideal for someone who wants an all-in-one solution on a mid-sized counter without spending money on separate appliances.  

**True Value**  
Let’s talk practicality. This coffee maker sits comfortably in a price range justified by its features. The flexibility to brew large batches for gatherings and singular servings for quick cravings makes it an economical addition to a home. For anyone running on budget constraints but still craving variety, this appliance ensures you’re not shelling out money on both a drip coffee machine and a single-serve device. Still, if you’re someone more drawn towards espresso, it may not score as high due to its just-okay crema performance. Overall, it’s a good middle ground for multi-functionality.

1moe8jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1moe8jx/explore_the_bodum_pour_over_coffee_maker_worth/,Explore the Bodum Pour Over Coffee Maker: Worth the Hype or Not?,"The Bodum 11592-01US caught my eye with its sleek, minimalist design and promised ability to brew barista-level coffee right at home. Being someone who can't start the day without a strong cup of coffee, I decided to try this pour-over coffee maker for myself. The idea of having total control over my coffee's flavor and strength was intriguing, and it's touted as an eco-friendly option? Count me in.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed it, I could tell that this isn’t just any ordinary coffee maker. The borosilicate glass carafe feels sturdy yet lightweight, and its high-heat resistance is apparent in the quality. I appreciate that it doesn’t absorb odors or flavors, ensuring every brew tastes just as intended. The stainless steel filter is a major highlight—reusable, durable, and elegant. Unlike paper filters that tend to steal the essential oils, this filter lets all the coffee goodness shine through. It’s a simple setup, but surprisingly sophisticated. The sleek black sleeve adds a layer of flair while keeping my hands safe from the heat, and overall, the compact design fits perfectly in my admittedly crowded kitchen.  

**Ease of Use**  
Making coffee with this device is so easy that even my teenager can manage it without issues. Scoop your ground coffee into the stainless steel filter, pour hot water over slowly, and let it bloom for a few minutes—it’s both manual and mindful, giving me a moment to enjoy the smell of freshly brewed coffee. There's a bit of a learning curve to get the perfect water-to-coffee ratio, but after two or three tries, I had it down. I found the process quite therapeutic too, similar to making tea in a traditional teapot.  

**Advantages**  
This coffee maker has impressed me beyond what I'd expected.  

- Eco-friendly with no disposable filters or pods required.  
- The permanent stainless steel filter enhances flavor by allowing oils to pass through.  
- Lightweight, portable, and easy to carry on trips.  
- Dishwasher-safe components make cleanup a breeze.

**Coffee Taste and Flavor**  
Here’s where the Bodum pour-over really shines. The coffee brewed is flavorful, aromatic, and smooth, with a richness that reminds me of what I’d get at my favorite café. The control over brewing time and water distribution lets me adjust the strength exactly how I like it. Honestly, it doesn’t feel like I’m compromising by not using an expensive espresso machine. My co-workers, who swear by their high-tech coffee makers, were equally impressed when I brought it into the office for a coffee-tasting session. A small tip: use medium to coarse grounds for best results, as finer grounds tend to clog the filter.  

**Durability and Maintenance**  
Given its simple mechanism, I’m confident this coffee maker will last me years. The borosilicate glass has shown no signs of chipping or staining even after weeks of daily use. I do rinse the stainless steel filter immediately after each brew to prevent any residue buildup, but the fact that it’s dishwasher safe means I give it a thorough cleaning without any extra effort. If you want a product that emphasizes low maintenance, this checks all the boxes.  

**Negatives**  
Although I’ve enjoyed using this coffee maker immensely, there are a few areas that could be better:  

- The absence of measurement markings on the carafe makes it tough to gauge how much water to add.  
- It’s not ideal if you’re brewing for larger groups; the 17-ounce capacity is more suited for one or two people.  
- Care needs to be taken when pouring to avoid spilling over the filter.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Compared to other pour-over coffee makers like the Chemex or Hario V60, the Bodum feels more durable, thanks to its borosilicate glass and reusable filter. While the Chemex wins on aesthetics and the V60 has a cult following for its precise brewing, the Bodum strikes a balance between style, convenience, and sustainability. Unlike the Chemex, there’s no need for paper filters, and it’s far more portable than the Hario, making it a great choice for travel or smaller kitchens. That said, if you’re someone who prefers brewing in larger quantities, you might find the Chemex more accommodating.  

**Value for Money**  
When it comes to cost-efficiency, the Bodum 11592-01US undeniably provides great value. You’re paying a modest price for a product that delivers consistent, café-quality coffee while promoting eco-consciousness. Over time, the savings from not having to buy paper filters or plastic pods really add up. It’s the kind of purchase I didn’t immediately notice the financial benefits of, but a few months in, I can see how economical it’s been.

You’re about to discover how you can make homemade instant coffee right in your kitchen, saving both time and money. This isn’t just about convenience; it’s about creating a delicious, custom coffee experience that matches your taste perfectly. You’ll be amazed at how simple it is to transform your coffee routine, and you’ll wonder why you didn’t try it sooner.

# Benefits Of Homemade Instant Coffee

Homemade instant coffee offers many benefits for coffee lovers. This simple method allows you to enjoy your favorite brew with less hassle. You can control every aspect of the coffee-making process. This ensures a perfect cup every time. Let’s explore some of the benefits of making instant coffee at home.

# 1. Cost-effective Solution

Store-bought instant coffee can be expensive. Making your own saves money. You can buy coffee beans in bulk. This reduces the overall cost. Fresh ingredients are always cheaper. Plus, there’s no need for pricey equipment.

# 2. Customized Flavor

You control the flavor of homemade instant coffee. Choose your favorite beans. Adjust the grind size to match your taste. Add spices or flavors if desired. Each cup is unique and tailored to you.

# 3. Freshness Guaranteed

Pre-packaged instant coffee often lacks freshness. Homemade ensures your coffee is fresh. Grind your beans just before brewing. This keeps the flavors rich and aromatic. Fresh coffee tastes better and smells delightful.

# 4. Environmentally Friendly

Homemade instant coffee reduces waste. No need for single-use packaging. Use reusable containers for storage. This helps the environment. You can enjoy coffee guilt-free.

# 5. Healthier Choice

Control what goes into your coffee. Store-bought options often contain additives. Homemade coffee uses pure ingredients. This makes it a healthier option. Enjoy your coffee without worry.

# Selecting The Right Coffee Beans

Creating homemade instant coffee begins with choosing the right beans. The quality of your coffee depends on the beans you select. Consider the coffee type and roast level carefully. These choices define the flavor and aroma of your instant coffee.

# Choosing Coffee Type

Start by deciding between Arabica and Robusta beans. Arabica beans offer a smoother taste. They have a sweeter and softer flavor. Robusta beans are stronger and have a bitter taste. They contain more caffeine and are less expensive. Decide which taste suits your preference.

# Roast Level Considerations

Roast level affects the flavor profile of your coffee. Light roast beans preserve the original bean flavors. They are bright and fruity. Medium roast beans have a balanced taste. They offer a mix of sweetness and acidity. Dark roast beans provide a bold and rich flavor. They carry smoky and chocolatey notes. Choose the roast level that matches your taste.

# Essential Equipment And Tools

Making homemade instant coffee is a rewarding experience that requires some essential equipment and tools to get it just right. You might be surprised to learn that creating your own instant coffee can be both fun and satisfying. With the right tools, you’ll not only enjoy the process but also brew a cup that matches your taste preferences perfectly. Imagine having the ability to customize your coffee every morning—it’s a small luxury worth exploring. So, what do you need to get started?

# Grinders

First off, a grinder is a crucial tool in your coffee-making arsenal. Freshly ground coffee beans can make a world of difference in flavor. Consider using a burr grinder for a consistent grind size, which is essential for brewing a perfect cup. If you’ve ever used a blade grinder, you’ll notice it tends to create uneven grounds, affecting the taste.

1moe7hx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Radiation/comments/1moe7hx/psa_dont_ask_what_geiger_counter_should_i_buy/,"PSA: Don't Ask ""What Geiger Counter Should I Buy?"" until you've read this post.","The most common question we see in this subreddit is some variant of the ""what device do I buy?"" question.  It's asked multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day.  It's so common that someone tried to create a flowchart to help newcomers.  As well thought-out as that flowchart is, it's like telling someone what car they should buy before they even know what a car is, what it can do, and what it can't do.  
  
If you're looking for the tl;dr or other shortcuts, sorry, there aren't any.  This post exists because there are too many ""Where do I start?"", ""What should I buy?"" and ""I just bought this... is this reading dangerous?"" posts from impatient newcomers who expect Reddit to teach them on the fly.  Doing that with radiation is a lot like buying a parachute and jumping out of an airplane... then whipping out your mobile device and asking Reddit for instructions.  Don't be that guy.  Be smarter.  Before you run out and buy ""baby's first Geiger Counter"", you should at least understand:

* The difference between ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, as well as the main types of radiation (alpha, beta, gamma, x-ray, and neutron).
* The difference between radiation and radioactive contamination.
* The difference between CPM and dose rate, and when to use each.
* The inverse-square law and how distance affects the readings you're looking at. 
* What ALARA is and how time, distance, and shielding reduce exposure.

There are more I could add, especially when it comes to health and safety, or detection devices themselves.  But, in my experience, these concepts are the ones that confuse newcomers and lead to erroneous or misleading posts.  To help you avoid the pitfalls of buying before knowing, or being ""that guy"", here are some resources to get you started in learning about Radiation, detection devices, biological effects, etc.  Listed from more basic, easy, and approachable to more comprehensive or advanced:  
  
If you prefer a website-based approach with links to other sites, videos, lots of pictures, etc... Head over to the [Radiation Emergency Medical Management website's Understanding the Basics About Radiation](https://remm.hhs.gov/remm_RadPhysics.htm) section and start your journey.

Prefer a textbook approach?  Grab a cup of coffee and sit down with the freely available [University of Wisconsin's Radiation Safety for Radiation Workers Manual](https://ehs.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1408/2024/04/Radiation-Safety-for-Radiation-Workers_Manual_2005.pdf).  There's a reason it's still used more than 20 years after it was first published.  The book starts with a good basic explanation of radiation and radioactivity.  The book then covers biological effects, regulations, lab procedures, how detectors work, X-ray machinery, irradiators, and nuclear reactors.  It even has chapters on lasers and RF radiation.  Some of the information is student and labworker-specific, but enough of the book's content is written in an approachable manner that it should be on every beginner's ""must-read"" list.

If the UW manual isn't deep enough for you, pick up a free copy of [Dan Gollnick's Basic Radiation Protection Technology (6th Edition)](https://www.nrrpt.org/file/Dan_Gollnick_Basic_Radiation_Book.pdf) from the NRRPT.  Essentially a self-study textbook for Radiation Protection Technologists, this book goes into even greater detail on the concepts, math, and minutiae involved in radiation protection.

All of the above too basic for you?  Well, buckle up because MIT offers numerous [Radiation-related and Nuclear Engineering courses](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Nuclear%20Science%20and%20Engineering&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum&u=compact) through its OpenCourseWare program.  Starting with [Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Ionizing Radiation](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/22-01-introduction-to-nuclear-engineering-and-ionizing-radiation-spring-2024/), each is a full college course with lectures, homework, and exams.  There's even a [Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Geiger Counters](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/22-s902-do-it-yourself-diy-geiger-counters-january-iap-2015/) course.

Congratulations!  If you've read this far, you're already on the right track.  The above isn't meant to be all-encompassing, and no doubt other Redditors will chime in with other excellent books, websites, and videos to help you get started learning about *ionizing* radiation and its effects.  Before you know it, your decision will have narrowed down some.  And, more importantly, your new device will be far more than just a ""magic box"" that shows you numbers you don't understand.",11,1755017789.0,Radiation,7,1.0,False

>When Zhaozhou asked Nanquan, “What is the Path?” Nanquan said, “The ordinary mind is the Path.”

>Zhaozhou said, “Can we go toward it or not?” Nanquan said, “As soon as you go toward it, you go against it.”

>Zhaozhou said, “If we do not try, how do we know it is the Path?” Nanquan said, “The Path is not in the province of knowing or not knowing. Knowing is false awareness. Not knowing is oblivion. If you really arrive on the Path of no trying, it is like space, empty all the way through. How can we impose affirmation and denial? ”

>At these words, Zhaozhou was suddenly enlightened.

>**Wumen said,**

>When Nanquan was questioned by Zhaozhou, he \[disintegrated\] like tiles scattering and ice melting and could not explain. But even if Zhaozhou did awaken, he still had to study thirty more years.

>**Verse**

>Spring has a hundred flowers... autumn has the moon.

>Summer has cool winds... winter has the snow.

>If there are no trivial things you hang your mind up on,

>This is the good season in the human realm.

I've decided I wanted to try my hand at translating this one. I don't really have much experience with the art of translation but it does fascinate me. I also don't speak a lick of Chinese. Yet. Hopefully the translation police won't come for me.

>**Wumenguan Case 19 - Ordinary is the Way**

>Zhaozhou asked Nanquan, ""What is the Way?""

>Nanquan replied, ""Your regular mind is the Way,""

>Zhaozhou asked, ""Can it be sought?""

>Nanquan replied, ""If you seek it, you'll go further from it,""

>Zhaozhou said ""But how will I know The Way unless I try?""

>Nanquan said ""The Way isn't a matter of knowing or not knowing. Knowing is delusion. Not knowing is stupor. When you actually reach the Way, without trying to, it is as vast and limitless as the cosmos. How could we speak about it in terms of 'right and wrong'?""

>Zhaozhou had a sudden realization.

>**Wumen's Comment**

>Zhaozhou's questions caused Nanquan to melt into a puddle of non-answers.

>Even though Zhaozhou had a realization, he still needed 30 more years to grasp it fully.

>**Wumen's Verse**

>Spring's flurry of flowers, the autumn moon.

>Summer's cool breeze, winter's snow.

>If you don't worry yourself with inconsequential matters,

>The world will be beautiful.

That was fun! Feel free to offer suggestions/corrections/resources for translation. I wonder if there are any pieces that need translation. I would be interested in trying to work with those.

1moe50s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayurveda/comments/1moe50s/new_here_pitta_burnout_food_confusion_feeling/,"New here. Pitta, burnout, food confusion & feeling ungrounded. Looking for advice.","
Hi everyone!
I’m new here and honestly in awe of all the wisdom shared in this group – it’s inspiring, but also a bit overwhelming. Still, I feel safe enough to share my story and would love to hear your thoughts or advice.

I’ve always cared a lot about health. It started with weightlifting and eating “clean” to look a certain way – lots of chicken, rice, veggies, protein powders, quark. Low fat, lots of cardio. I looked fit, but eventually I crashed. I lost my period, developed binge eating, and felt completely out of touch with myself.

Then came a “bulk” – more fats, more meat, carbs, eggs, etc. My period came back for a while, and I felt more stable. But then I wanted to cut again… and tried keto. That made things worse. No period, lots of binges, zero energy.
I kept thinking, “If I just eat the right things, I’ll feel better.”

So I tried to eat “perfectly healthy”: fermented foods, raw garlic, onions, lots of meat (especially red meat and organs), salmon, eggs, tons of veggies, fruits, nuts. On paper, it looked amazing. But inside… I felt awful.

I’m also very spiritual, and I started noticing that the food I ate might have been “healthy” by modern standards, but it felt like it didn’t nourish me on a deeper level. It was like I was eating for my body to look a certain way – not for emotional or energetic balance.
Emotionally, I’m all over the place: super high highs, followed by intense dips, panic attacks, depressive thoughts. I have a lot of fire and drive, but it often burns me out.

Recently I discovered Ayurveda, and I immediately resonated with the Pitta dosha.
And then it hit me: I’ve basically been feeding my fire for years.
Tons of spicy food (I love sambal), tomatoes, garlic, onions, fermented foods, coffee… all of which aggravate Pitta. Oops.

For the past 3 days, I’ve been trying to follow a more Pitta-pacifying way of eating.
I’m focusing on cooling, grounding, simple foods:
	•	Breakfast: stewed pear with oats, coconut milk, flaxseed, and some protein
	•	Lunch: chicken breast with sweet potato and avocado
	•	Snacks: melon, 3 dates
	•	Dinner: lentil & kidney bean stew with zucchini and white rice

I’ve cut out caffeine, spicy food, red meat, and fermented stuff.
I’m trying to be more mindful and not just eat what’s “right” by diet culture standards, but what feels nourishing emotionally and energetically.

That said… I’m still struggling.
My period is gone again.
I sometimes feel like I could collapse from exhaustion.
I get intense emotional crashes – low moods, brain fog, heavy energy.
But then I also have bursts of crazy fire and motivation – and then crash again.

⸻

Has anyone else gone through something like this?
How do you truly balance health, hormones, and emotional/spiritual well-being?

Any tips for transitioning to a more grounded, Pitta-friendly lifestyle (and mind)?
Would love to hear your experience – I feel like I’m finally on the right path, but it’s hard to know what’s real or right when you’ve tried so much.

Thank you for reading this far 🙏

1moe35n,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1moe35n/part_4_the_pancake_house_apocalypse_guide/,Part 4 The Pancake House Apocalypse Guide,"Chapter 4 - Mick

	The small family ended up sleeping in the dining room that night after Marcus requested that I lock the front door when Cain went to his dumpster.

	“He’s mostly harmless, the worst he’s done to a customer is ask for money or steal food.”

	“Worst he’s done to a customer?”  Asked Marcus with a raised eyebrow.

	“Well he’s beat the tar out of nastier crackheads, he’s sort of the place’s local stray cat that you keep around for rats.”

	“I see.”  Said Marcus, still plainly not trusting Cain.

	The day the family left marked exactly one week since I had watched the first side of the vhs tape and the beginning of the storm that still had not ceased its bombardment.  So, having nothing better to do, I loaded up the vhs tape and turned the tv on to watch my second training video.

	“Greeeetings loyal Star employee of Pancake House!  And welcome to part two of The Pancake House Apocalypse Guide!”  The cheerful tone of the narrator made my stomach lurch for some reason.  “This week’s topics will be on acceptable payments and the specific peculiarities of the periodic deliveries.”

	“Uh oh”  I said, remembering that I had “bartered” meals for a log of dip the previous night.

	“First and foremost, we do not begrudge any employee from bartering with customers that do not have any other means of payment as our primary goal is to cement in the minds of the survivors that Pancake House was there for them when no one else was.  Any and all goods or non fungible tokens that are collected as payment will be split between the Star employee and the larger Pancake House entity.”  As the narrator spoke, A.I. generated videos of people with far too many fingers traded nudie magazines and chickens with human eyes to a Pancake House employee in exchange for a short stack of pancakes and coffee.

	I let out a sigh of relief, hearing that they weren’t going to require me to write down credit card numbers or save checks until the local Bank of America opens back up again.

	“We believe that a 30/70 split should be more than sufficient to keep you supplied with external goods and maintain staff morale while also supporting all the people who are working in the background to keep YOU stocked.  The company’s portion of the split shall be put in the black metal box next to the back door for retrieval by the delivery team.”  The video changed to something that was reminiscent of WWII American propaganda of women and children working in factories unloading trucks full of what looked like garbage and nicknacks.    

	“Lastly, the first resupply mission is underway to your location and should reach you by the end of the day.  You will not interact with the driver nor will you interact with the enti- staff that will unload your goods to the back door.  Any transgressions of this will result in immediate termination of your employment.”  

	This bit sent chills up my spine as I remembered their version of “termination” for just eating too much of the stock.

	“This will conclude the second part of the Pancake House Apocalypse Guide and I once again ask you to flip the vhs tape to the other side to continue your training in one week's time.  Ta ta then bye bye now.”  Then the screen went black.

	“Flip the tape back over?”  I asked aloud to the black screen.

	“Hadn’t I already turned it over to watch this section?”  I thought before shrugging.

	The rest of the day was spent watching the rain continue its ceaseless bombardment of the pavement outside and the occasional dog roam the empty streets, searching for their humans.  Cain came in after a few hours and we shared a meal of eggs and hashbrowns in mostly silence before he got up and left the dining room and went back to his den.  A little while after that, a large white box truck trundled down the flooding street, sending torrents of water splashing over the sidewalks.  The windows were completely blacked out from tint and I wondered how the driver could see in the already murky haze of the storm.

	The box truck pulled around the building and I could hear the squealing protest of the brakes as the driver mashed his foot down on the pedal.  Then I remembered that I hadn’t yet split the company’s (profit?) of the tobacco and I dashed to my bunk where I had the log of dip in my bag.  Guesstimating seventy percent of the remaining log, I ripped off most of the cans and ran to the back door.  However, by the time I had flung the back door open, the truck was speeding away and there was a pallet of shrink wrapped supplies.  I looked to my left and sure enough, there was a black metal box labelled “FOR PROFIT.”

	Placing the tins of dip in the box, I could only hope that the company wouldn’t terminate me for putting their cut of the “profits” immediately after receiving them.  Besides, I’d surely be getting regular if not many deliveries.  I hoped.

	Working quickly, I brought the boxes inside and began throwing out old rotten product and replacing it with fresh product from wherever the company had procured it from.

	The next couple days went by in a slow and monotonous blur, the only break in the monotony was the arrival of a woman and a particularly aggravating goat.  I served the woman eggs and hashbrowns and she fed the goat pancakes.  The goat would loudly bleat whenever his “mother’s” attention wasn’t fully on him and seemed to shit every five minutes which I dutifully swept up muttering under my breath about gyros.  I couldn’t understand how the woman put up with the creature but she adored it.  In exchange for the food, the woman traded me a length of rope and a rather strange foot fetish book featuring a man wearing only boxer shorts with red hearts and a cat.  I’m sure I don’t have to tell you which one was put into the company’s share.  I ran out of paper before he entered and couldn’t remember her story but it was pretty fascinating from what I could remember.  After they left, I made sure to raid the Sergeant Dollar for all the notebooks they had.

At night, sleeping on the cot in the backroom, I had strange dreams.  I never remember them in their entirety but I usually awaken with fear coursing through my core and sweat pouring down my head.  One common theme that I can pin down is a purplish light growing in intensity over the oceanic horizon and a woman with caramel skin and dark curls.  The first part is obviously an over active mind reacting to Marcus’ story but I cannot place what the woman is about.

One day, when the rain had made one of its transitions to a thick fog that soaked you more thoroughly than the usual torrential downpour, I watched the silhouette of a centaur make its way down the street towards the beacon that was the Pancake House sign.  It was only once the figure was illuminated by the fluorescent yellow sign of the Pancake House that I saw that it wasn’t a mythical creature summoned from a magical British wardrobe, but a man atop a piebald horse complete with lasso and cowboy hat.  The horse pawed majestically at the asphalt as the cowboy scanned the interior of the building.  When his gaze landed on me I gave him a little wave which I immediately regretted doing in front of this much manlier man.  After hitching the horse to a light pole on the small patch of long grass that had bordered the parking lot, the cowboy walked to the front door.

The man wore dirty blue and weathered blue jeans tucked into tall and worn riding boots.  He wore a large leather duster jacket over a flannel shirt.  His impressive handle bar mustache was brown, flecked with grey and had bushy eyebrows on tan leathery skin.

“Howdy sir! Welcome to Pancake House.”

“Don’t be queer no one says that.”  Said the man in a gruff voice with just the hint of a country accent.

“Gotcha.”  I replied, red faced as he took a seat at the bar.  “Well sir, what can I get for you?  And just so you know, if you don’t have cash, we do accept barter.”

“We?”  He asked brusquely.

“Uh, The Pancake House sir.”

“The Pancake House?”  He asked with a single raised eyebrow.  (I always got jealous when people did that.)

“Y-yeah, we’re still open and the company is accepting bartering as legal tender.”

“So you’re the only one working here?”  He said, trying to look in the back room.

“Yes sir.”  I said before realizing I had the survival instincts of a Dodo bird.  Trying to distract the potential murderer that I was both an idiot and alone, I asked.  “Your horse like pancakes?”  When I was briefly a ranch hand, I always enjoyed feeding the rancher’s few horses; feeling the soft coat of their muzzles on my palm always made getting up at the ass crack of dawn almost worth it.

“Sue?  Yeah she likes ‘em.  You got any oatmeal?”

“Yeah actually we do, just got a shipment the other day.”  

His face turned incredulous for a moment then relaxed as he said, “I guess Pancake House being open during the end times isn’t the weirdest thing I’ve found out this month.”  He was silent for a moment before adding, “Throw on some bacon, eggs, sausage and hashbrowns with the fixings.  I’ll also take a short stack for myself and a tall stack for Sue as well as much oatmeal as you can give me.”

	“Tall order.”  I said with a joking smile on my face before it turned horrified as he slammed a revolver onto the counter.  “Holy Jesus FUCK! I’m sorry!  I’ll do it!”

	“Relax kid,”  said the man in a raised tone so that I could hear him over my panicked yelling, “it’s my trade offer, afraid I only got one bullet so take this as a tip.”  He flipped a golden coin with a strange embossment of a squidlike figure in the center and alien text scrawled along the edge of the coin.

	Catching my breath, and feeling embarrassed I replied, “S-sorry sir, just a bit on edge ya’know.”  I said in a panicked laugh.

	“Don’t call me sir, just call me Eliot.”

	“Y-you’ve got it, Eliot.”  I said, still unnerved.

	Setting the gun and coin to the side I got to work filling Eliot’s order throwing four sausages, four strips of bacon, three eggs and nine pancakes onto the seasoned flat top.  I placed the hashbrowns down hill from the bacon and sausages, allowing the sizzling and popping fat to seep into the shredded spuds.  After I had gathered a good five pounds of oatmeal from the back, only one of the dozen or so containers of the stuff, it was time to flip everything.  Eliot ordered the hashbrowns with all the fixings which included ham, onions, peppers, cheese, mushrooms, tomatoes, gravy and chili.  

“The man must’ve had a gut of iron and fire.”  I thought to myself as I set the large meal in front of the man and he took his horse’s share out to her before he ate himself.

I watched as he took the saddle and riding blankets off her back and gave her a good brushing and rub down before placing the food in a feed bag for her.  I wondered where Cain was while watching the meticulous care of the animal and hoped he wouldn’t mess with the man’s obviously beloved companion.  Eliot walked back to the front door and kicked one side open, I could now see the butt of a rifle covered in a leather wrap for weather proofing protruding from the side of the saddle.  

“So, where are you from?”  I asked, breaking the long silence that had fallen over the diner during Eliot’s meal.

“Northwest of here.”

“Oh, cool.  Cool.”  I began awkwardly.  “I’m also from out west myself.”

Eliot didn’t respond but kept eating slowly and deliberately like the workings of an ancient machine toiling away at a sisyphean task.

“Would you mind terribly if I asked you to tell me about what it’s like out there Eliot?”

He kept his silence for a few moments longer and gave me such a stare that I felt like a child again.  

“Give me a coffee and I’ll tell you, but only if you promise to shut the hell up for the rest of the evening.”

So, catching the hint, I shut my mouth and filled his cup and kept the pot on the warmer as I watched him finish his food.

“Will you find something to do with yourself?  You’re making me fucking nervous staring at me like I got dicks growing out my damn ears!”

This made me jump to my feet and I began cleaning the mostly immaculate kitchen.  Finally, after an indeterminate time and making up several tasks to keep from bothering the guy, Eliot spoke.

However, the stock handle has a recessed 10mm bolt that when screwed down, covers an ugly portion of the head. I know there are many replacement handles with a 10mm bolt, however if used, they would expose that ugly portion of the PF head (below the R logo). 

If there are no handles, anyone found a good bottomless PF with a walnut handle that seals well? ",1,1755017488.0,ranciliosilvia,1,1.0,False

1moe0fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1moe0fa/discover_the_youcox_cord_organizer_review_for/,Discover the YOUCOX Cord Organizer review for hassle-free kitchen appliance management!,"The YOUCOX B0BCX3KPYM Cord Organizer for Appliances has been quite the addition to my kitchen. Its main pitch is keeping your appliance cords neat and, boy, does it deliver! I’ve tested this in my own space, and if there’s one thing I dislike, it’s having a mess of cables around. My air fryer and coffee maker always seem to have unruly cords, but this cord organizer immediately handled the issue. My experience with this product has been satisfying overall, though there are small considerations to keep in mind.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this cord organizer screams utility with a subtle dose of style. Its butterfly shape is not only practical but also manages to look quite sleek. I particularly love how flexible the material is, yet it feels sturdy enough to endure daily use. Being made of TPR food-grade silicone, this little gadget is both safe and durable—it’s non-toxic and BPA-free, which makes sense for something meant to stay on kitchen devices. I’ve personally wrapped it on my air fryer and blender cords with no concern for wear and tear. The stickiness of the 3M backing is no joke; once it’s on, you shouldn’t have to worry about it falling off. I tried repositioning one of mine, and there were no adhesive leftovers or scratches left behind.

**Compatibility Across Appliances**  
The compatibility of this product is next-level convenient. I’ve stuck these organizers to a variety of surfaces, including metal on my toaster, glass on the coffee maker, and even a plastic compartment on my blender. What surprised me was how versatile it is—not all adhesive solutions work across such diverse materials with equal strength. After doing some digging, I noticed other users have used it on wallpaper-backed areas or even wooden appliances. For my own kitchen, it worked well across every surface I threw at it, even some curved parts.

**Upsides**  
- Easy to install with strong adhesive backing.  
- Flexible silicone material ensures durability.  
- Works with most kitchen appliance cords.  
- Stylish butterfly design adds a modern touch to function.  

**Potential Hurdles**  
- Removal might need care to avoid stretched silicone.  
- Stickiness may not last equally across all conditions (e.g., high humidity).  

**Ease of Use**  
How easy is it to use? Incredibly. You simply peel off the adhesive and stick it wherever your cord nightmare resides. After installing these on my coffee maker, toaster, and blender, winding the cords became second nature. However, one tip: ensure that the area is clean and dry before sticking, or else the adhesive loses some of its grip. A wet surface might mess up that super stick, so it pays to prep the space beforehand. For folks who often move gadgets around, I did notice you might have to replace the adhesive over time.

[See YOUCOX B0BCX3KPYM deals on Amazon now.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0bcx3kpym/)

**Performance**  
Overall, the performance has been excellent. The cords stay very secure once wrapped, and I appreciate that the silicone doesn’t add any extra bulk to the device. During daily use, even after countless unplugs and re-plugs of my appliances, the organizer itself hasn’t budged. That said, I completely understand why it might not hold up for eternity on appliances exposed to heat or moisture regularly.

**Product Alternatives**  
Compared to similar cord organizers out there—such as some random plastic hooks I've tried in the past—this one takes the cake. It’s safer due to being BPA-free, and honestly, silicone offers more durability than most plastic alternatives, which either snap off or lose hold within a week. Products like cable-tie-based organizers solve temporary headaches, but they lack the tidy permanence or compatibility seen with this. If you're looking for similar solutions, plastic wraps or velcro cable ties might be alternatives to consider, though nothing blends utility and aesthetics quite like this gadget.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
From a cost perspective, this product delivers great utility for the investment without breaking the bank. With its reusable adhesive and durable silicone, the long-term value seems obvious. For how much time it saves me daily—avoiding tangled cords when cooking or tidying the kitchen—I’d definitely say it’s worth it. It's more affordable than buying disposable zip ties over and over. And considering its multi-surface ability, the price makes it stand tall among its competitors.

1moe0bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1moe0bp/does_tide_pods_free_gentle_detergent_pac_deliver/,Does Tide PODS Free & Gentle Detergent Pac Deliver on Skin-Safe Cleaning? Review,"As someone who takes laundry seriously, I was particularly drawn to the Tide 3229 PODS Free & Gentle Laundry Detergent Pacs. I spend more hours than I care to admit battling stubborn stains from coffee spills, grass marks, and the unfortunate spaghetti sauce splashes. My goal in testing this product was to see if it lived up to the buzz around its cleaning prowess without irritating sensitive skin, since my household has skin sensitivity concerns. Spoiler alert: It performs remarkably well—mostly. That said, let me walk you through everything you’d need to know about these handy little detergent pods.

**Convenient Design and Ease of Use**  
The simplicity of these detergent pods was one of the first standout features. Coming home late from work to piles of laundry is always daunting, but having something as easy as “drop-in-and-done” turns it into a much smaller chore. Each pod combines detergent, stain remover, and color protector, which means I didn’t have to measure liquid or handle messy powders. All I had to do was toss one pod directly into the washing machine drum before adding clothes. Whether you're tech-savvy or washing your first load, the simple design will win you over. 

[Check Tide 3229 PODS Free & Gentle price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0btkkjlls/)

**Cleaning Performance That Packs a Punch**  
Testing these pods on various fabrics, including bright whites and dark delicates, felt like a science experiment. The results were surprisingly consistent. It tackled the usual suspects—coffee stains, grass spots, and even that random marinara sauce I always seem to wear. What shocks me the most is how effective these pods are in cold water. Not everyone prefers hot cycles, so this versatility earns major points. And yes, it does all of this while being gentle on skin.

**Hypoallergenic Formula for Sensitive Skin**  
Living in a household with sensitive skin means we scrutinize everything laundry-related. The Tide 3229 PODS lived up to its promise of being hypoallergenic. Instead of perfumes or dyes that might irritate, this product sticks to a skin-friendly formula. I appreciated that it's certified by both the NEA (National Eczema Association) and NPF (National Psoriasis Foundation). If you or a loved one deals with eczema or allergies, this option feels like a safe bet.

**Key Benefits**  
A few highlights really caught my attention as I continued testing:  
- Easy, mess-free “drop-in” application.  
- Consistently tackled 100% of common stains I tested.  
- Safe for all washing machines and water conditions, including HE machines.  
- Formula is certified hypoallergenic (no perfumes or dyes).  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Though these detergent pods have much going for them, I noticed a few things worth addressing:  
- Not every stain is obliterated in one wash. Heavier stains sometimes needed an extra pod or pre-treatment.  
- While the unscented formula is a win for sensitive skin, those who love a fresh-smelling finish might feel underwhelmed without added scent enhancers.  
- Larger families may burn through the 112-count container relatively quickly depending on load sizes.  

**Product Competitors**  
When stacked against competitors, Tide’s Free & Gentle pods hold their ground but face some stiff challenges too. For example, Seventh Generation Free & Clear packs boast similar hypoallergenic benefits with a plant-based formula. However, they lack the same cleaning power for particularly stubborn stains. Then there's All Free Clear Mighty Pacs, which are cheaper and still effective but do not perform as well in cold water. Tide seems to be in the sweet spot of stain-fighting strength and skin-friendliness, though the price is still higher compared to budget-friendly alternatives.

**Price Worthiness**  
This product falls into the premium category, but it’s clear why. You’re not only paying for a detergent but also a stain remover and color protector rolled into one. Sure, the upfront investment might feel steep compared to traditional options, but for someone like me who juggles sensitive skin concerns and tough stains, it’s worth every penny. Keep in mind, you’re saving on secondary stain treatments or specialty detergents by combining multiple functions in one product. If value and performance harmonize for you, these pods may be just what your laundry room is missing.

1modzdu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1modzdu,New sofa - need help with living room furniture & decor for small living room,"We’ve been living in our house for several years and finally found a sectional that we like. (We have a fairly small living room so it’s been a bit of a challenge.) Previously, we just had a small loveseat and two armchairs, and we never had enough seating when hosting guests. We love the new couch, but I have a few questions that I would appreciate input on. 

One of the main issues I need to resolve is finding some sort of table or set of tables for near the couch. We’ve considered a narrow end table by each arm rest, or a narrow coffee table. I love the idea of a  coffee table since I think it would be accessible to more of the seats. Three of the seats in the couch are recliners, so maybe something small and on wheels that could easily be moved around? And/or nested tables? However, my husband is worried about it taking up too much space, which I think is a fair point. I also haven’t really found anything I love yet. (If you have any recommendations, please share! Solid wood is preferred.) I’d also like to get a small drink table for the arm chair. 

A couple of other questions: 
1. My husband and I want to avoid our house feeling cluttered. Alternatively, I don’t want it to feel too plain/empty. Is more decor needed? What do you recommend? I just hung the photos by the window, but I’d be open to moving those elsewhere in the house if some other configuration of wall decor would be better. Also, we plan to add a low profile fireplace mantle sometime soon. 
2. Do we need more throw pillows? I think so?
3. Does the rug seem like an okay size for the room? I thought we might need to size up but after bringing in the couch I think it might actually be okay. 

One last thing - I don’t really want to add curtains. I do like the look, but we’ve had them in this room before, and I found them very annoying to deal with.

1mody9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mody9r/explore_best_countertop_microwave_oven_sharp/,Explore Best Countertop Microwave Oven Sharp SMC2266KS Review Worth It,"The Sharp SMC2266KS countertop microwave oven has been a surprising addition to my kitchen. I wasn’t looking for something too fancy, but this microwave managed to tick nearly all the boxes for me. With its family-sized capacity of 2.2 cubic feet, it easily handles large casserole dishes, oversized serving trays, and everything else I seem to throw at it. Paired with its 1200 watts of power, everyday tasks like reheating leftovers or defrosting dinner ingredients have become a breeze. Its brushed stainless steel finish fits seamlessly into my kitchen's aesthetic, but there’s more beneath the surface than just good looks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This microwave's modern stainless steel finish instantly grabs your attention. It looks clean, sophisticated, and fits right in whether your kitchen vibe is sleek and contemporary or a bit more traditional. The buttons and the ""+30 seconds"" key are responsive, while the white LED display and interior lighting make it so much easier to see what’s happening inside. I also appreciate the 16.5"" removable Carousel turntable – it ensures even cooking every time, and cleaning it is as simple as giving it a quick rinse in the sink. The weight of nearly 34 pounds does make it feel solid but be prepared for a bit of a workout if you’re moving it around.  

**Performance and Efficiency**  
The raw power of 1200 watts is evident from the moment you start using it. I tested different power levels, from heating a quick cup of coffee to defrosting meat, and it consistently delivered. The Sensor Cook technology is also a game-changer. I often struggle with knowing how long to reheat certain leftovers, and this microwave adjusts cooking times automatically based on what’s inside. The result? Perfectly warmed meals, no more rubbery pizzas or unevenly heated dinners. The inverter cooking technology means even delicate items like soups heat evenly without splattering.

**Advantages**  
- Fits large dishes and family portions with its 2.2 cubic feet capacity.  
- 16.5"" Carousel turntable ensures even cooking and quick cleaning.  
- Sensor Cook and Auto Defrost functions simplify cooking tasks.  
- Modern and clean stainless steel aesthetic.  
- Responsive controls and bright LED lighting for better visibility.  

Check [Sharp SMC2266KS] price on Amazon.

**Features Worth Highlighting**  
The pre-set cooking options have been surprisingly convenient. The Auto Cook feature includes settings for various items like popcorn, frozen meals, potatoes, and vegetables. As someone who frequently melts butter for baking or softens ice cream for dessert, the Melt/Soften function saves me a lot of guesswork. Even the express cook options – ranging from one to six minutes at full power – are just a button press away, making it ideal when you’re in a rush.  

The Weight and Time Defrost function deserves its own shoutout. I’ve struggled with microwaves that leave frozen chicken partially icy or overcooked, but this one nails it. The combination of precision and speed has been a delightful perk.  

**Drawbacks**  
While it nails performance, there are a few things to consider:  
- The bulky size might not suit smaller kitchens or tight counter spaces.  
- It’s somewhat noisy when operating, especially at high power levels.  
- The stainless steel exterior, though beautiful, shows fingerprints easily, so regular cleaning is a must.  

**Product Rivals**  
I compared this to a model from Panasonic, which also boasts a large capacity and strong wattage. That competitor had a slight edge in terms of quieter operation, but its controls felt unintuitive to me compared to the friendly design of this microwave. Others like Toshiba offer comparable capacity, but they lack the same reliable Sensor Cook technology that Sharp delivers consistently, making this a clear winner for those focused on ease of use and cooking precision.

**Value for Money**  
Looking at what the market offers, the Sharp SMC2266KS strikes a great balance between features and cost. Its combination of power, size, and user-friendly features makes it feel like an investment that pays off quickly, especially for larger households or anyone who uses their microwave regularly. It competes fiercely against higher-end models without skimping on the essentials. Sure, it’s not the cheapest option out there, but its performance justifies the price.

1modxpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1modxpx/why_feeling_productive_while_studying_can/,Why “feeling productive” while studying can actually be holding you back,"I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve finished a 3-hour podcast or audiobook and thought: wow, that was brilliant.

Fast forward a week. and I can barely recall half of it. Just vague ideas and “smart-sounding” phrases floating around my head. Nothing I could actually explain to someone else or use in real life.

I’m a cadet pilot and psych student, so I’ve learned the hard way there’s a massive difference between hearing something and actually learning it. In the cockpit, you can’t fake understanding. Either the knowledge is wired into your brain and muscle memory, or you’re toast.

# The “I totally get this” trap

There’s a psychology term for this: the fluency illusion. Something feels familiar, so your brain assumes you’ve learned it. The sentences flowed, the examples made sense, you nodded along so you think you “know” it.

Then someone asks you to explain it and you realize you’re just staring into mental static.

There’s also the illusion of explanatory depth: you think you understand something (blockchain, inflation, even how a toilet works) until you try to explain it in detail and realize your “understanding” is basically a sketch with no blueprint behind it.

# Why it feels like progress (but isn’t)

Our brains love novelty. Hearing something new gives you a little dopamine kick like that first sip of coffee. So you can have a podcast on while cooking, hear an interesting bit about sleep or productivity, and feel smarter in the moment.

But it’s just entertainment disguised as learning. It’s not bad content it’s just a bad way to learn.

# The “gym but no workout” problem

This is where passive learning gets sneaky. You feel like you’re working on yourself. But you’re skipping the boring, uncomfortable part where you actually practice or test what you’ve learned.

It’s like going to the gym in full workout gear, chatting about training techniques, taking selfies but never touching a barbell.

# What real learning actually feels like

In flight school, you don’t just watch videos of emergency landings and call it a day. You do them over and over until your hands move before your brain even thinks. That’s procedural memory. It sticks because you drilled it until you were sick of it.

Real learning is repetitive. Messy. Sometimes frustrating. Definitely not something you can absorb while folding laundry.

# Quick test are you really learning?

    •	Can you explain what you learned yesterday in your own words?
    •	Have you actually used it in work, study, training, or decisions?
    •	Did you pause to think/write about it, or just let it play in the background?
    •	Has it changed anything you actually do?

If you answered “no” to most of these, you’re just snacking on ideas not building mental muscle.

# How to make it stick:

    1.	Slow down – Don’t binge 10 podcasts in a week. Pick one thing and go deep.
    2.	Explain it – Write it out in your own words. If you can’t, you don’t know it yet.
    3.	Use it ASAP – Bring it up in a conversation, apply it to a project, test it out.
    4.	Revisit later – Come back to it in a week or two to see what’s still there.

Passive learning feels good. Active learning feels like work. But when life throws turbulence at you in the air, in the gym, or anywhere else only the stuff you’ve really worked for will be there when you need it.",9,1755017199.0,GetStudying,3,1.0,False

I’ve been finding myself crashing and feeling sleepy more often than I should. Coffee and energy drinks mostly put me to sleep, and tea might as well be water. 

The weird part is, caffeine only seems to work for me the first 1-2 times I try a new type or brand; zero effect on me after that. I feel like I’m building a tolerance to caffeine but at the same time doubt it since I rarely drink any in the first place (again, because they just make me sleepy).

Anyway, I can’t really rely on caffeine to stay awake and focused so I’m looking for other drinks that can help me get things done lol. Badly need suggestions because I really need to get my stuff together for a bunch of upcoming exams.

Is anyone else scrolling through apps and seeing these all-over-the-place ""pay-per-captcha"" or ""app testing gate"" things?? At first, I thought I was dreaming.  

But after falling into a rabbit hole because, honestly, who *doesn't* want to get paid to click CAPTCHAS... I’ve got QUESTIONS and some absolute mind-blowers to share.

**Here’s How My Thought Process Went:**  

- Wait, you mean I could literally EARN REAL MONEY by just solving puzzles that prove I’m not a bot?  
- What’s the catch here? Test apps, click some boxes, BOOM?  
- OMG, am I going to be rich by tomorrow morning? I can’t tell if it’s a scam, the future, or both.

So I dug WAAAY deeper.

And here’s what absolutely floored me:

**1. This Stuff Is EVERYWHERE.**  
Every third ""make money from home"" post funnels you to app testing platforms. Try for yourself at **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (not kidding, bookmark that!!).  
They claim it’s almost effortless. Just install, test, click captchas, ka-CHING?  

**2. But Wait—Are People Really Getting Paid?**  
I scrolled Reddit, I scoured forums — feedback is mixed but some people ARE showing their payouts!  
Some are making coffee money, some more. Some claim hours for literal pennies. YMMV.  
Stumbled (again) on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** because, let’s be honest, I HAVE to see for myself.  

**3. What’s Actually Happening?**  
- The “gate” is usually a CAPTCHA meant to weed out bots from actual humans.
- But the goldmine is, you’re the product. Your human attention & participation = $ for companies wanting... well, validation their app isn’t being botted.
- Some apps wrap these captchas as ""human intelligence tasks"".

**The Real Kicker?**  
Testing out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** was easier than I expected. Like, it's just a few taps, some quick feedback, done. I’m honestly confused – is this the easiest ""side hustle"" or a waste of time?  

**BUT…**  
- Don’t expect to quit your day job unless you find the magical unicorn of gigs.
- Payouts can take time or require hitting a ""minimum.""
- Beware of apps asking you for money up front – 🚩 BIG red flag.

**So, What Did I Learn?**  

- You can actually get some side change if you just want something SUPER easy.
- If you have lightning-fast CAPTCHA reflexes? Even more.
- The top one I kept seeing, **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, seems acc legit for dipping your toes in this weirdo economy.
- But it’s not going to fund your trip to Bali.

My mind = blown AND confused at the same time.

Has anyone else tried **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** or some similar app gateway and actually cashed out?

Nearly three years passed. I was sure our paths would never cross again. Then suddenly… there she was, working just across from me. I don’t know if she saw me that day, but I saw her , and every feeling I thought I’d buried came rushing back.

Now, I’ve been offered another job. I might be leaving soon. And I can’t shake the feeling that bumping into her again wasn’t random.

The truth? Pride kept me from speaking before. I was afraid to be vulnerable, afraid to hurt my ego. And yes, there’s history , we used to follow each other on an app, but after I once asked her for coffee and she gave me no clear answer, I removed her to protect myself, didn’t work tho . That’s why I know she won’t be the one to start a conversation now.

But it’s been five years. And I can’t help but wonder , if I leave without saying a word, will I regret it for the rest of my life? And I am sure that if i leave this time , i will never see her again. 

So… do I talk to her before I go? Or do I let this be another unfinished chapter in my life?

1modpng,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1modpng/explore_best_coffee_machine_ninja_cfp301_and_is/,Explore Best Coffee Machine Ninja CFP301 and Is It Worth It,"Testing out the Ninja CFP301 coffee maker was quite the experience, and I can see why it has garnered such attention in its category. From the moment I unboxed this sleek black machine, it was clear that versatility was its primary promise. As someone who drinks everything from frothy lattes to straightforward black coffee, I was intrigued by its extensive features.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that stood out was the sturdy yet compact design. Despite its capability to brew both single-serve coffee and large 12-cup carafes, the machine doesn't monopolize countertop space, which is a blessing in a crowded kitchen. Its black finish blends seamlessly into modern kitchen aesthetics, making it more than just an appliance—it’s a low-profile style statement. At 9.69 pounds, it’s sturdy but not inconvenient to move around if needed. The materials feel well-chosen, though the plastic construction may not win over those who prefer steel-heavy builds. That said, it doesn’t feel flimsy, and all components fit together snugly.  

**Ease of Use: A True All-Rounder**  
As someone who fumbles through groggy mornings, I appreciated how straightforward the interface was. With fully automatic operation, you can brew a K-Cup pod just as easily as you can prepare an entire carafe with grounds. What sets this product apart is the inclusion of nine brew size options for grounds and four for pods, allowing customizability depending on your caffeine needs for the day. Whether it’s a single travel mug for my commute or a full carafe for slow weekends, this brewer covers all bases. **Check [Ninja CFP301](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0btp84qm5/) price on Amazon.**

**Performance: Faster and Richer Brews**  
One claim that this coffee maker holds true is its speed. Compared to my previous brewing devices, the Ninja CFP301 brews significantly faster, even when starting from standby mode. It’s efficient without compromising quality, especially noticeable with K-Cup coffee pods. The four brewing options—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—cover a wide spectrum of coffee preferences. My favorite by far is the “Rich” option, which extracts deeper flavors from the grounds without tasting bitter. On testing the over-ice feature, I noticed it brewed concentrated coffee to avoid the dreaded dilution once the ice starts melting—pure genius!  

**Milk Frother and Specialty Brew**  
Incorporating a milk frother with an easy-to-operate wand was a game-changer. This machine’s Specialty Brew setting was put through rigorous testing for lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos, and each time, the results mimicked a café experience. I served it to my family over the holidays, and even my nit-picky cousin couldn’t find fault with the foam consistency. While it doesn’t heat milk directly (I had to do this on the side), the richness of the coffee concentrate made every specialty drink worth the extra step.

**Good Points**  
- A whopping nine brew sizes for grounds alongside four for pods gives unmatched versatility.  
- Brew speeds are impressively consistent, even with full carafes.  
- Specialty options allow for barista-style coffee creations at home.  
- The integrated milk frother delivers café-quality foam effortlessly.  
- Dual coffee system eliminates the need for multiple devices in a single kitchen.  

**Hurdles**  
- Its plastic construction might not appeal to everyone.  
- Cleaning the frother wand and other brewing components requires diligence to avoid buildup.  
- While the system for pods works seamlessly, some users may notice slight compatibility limitations with non-standard pod sizes.  

**Independent Hot Water System**  
What takes this coffee maker beyond just coffee brewing is its separate hot water dispenser. Offering two temperature settings, hot and boil, I found it handy for tasks like making instant oatmeal during rushed mornings. Its independence from the coffee system eliminates the risk of residual coffee flavor sneaking into non-coffee items, which has been a persistent issue with some of the other dual systems I’ve tried.  

**Product Contenders**  
Nestle’s Nespresso VertuoLine and Keurig K-Elite are two products that came to mind when comparing functionality. While the VertuoLine delivers a premium espresso experience with its capsules, it limits brew size and versatility for larger ground-based servings. Comparatively, the Keurig K-Elite focuses on speed but doesn’t quite match the specialty drink options or frother capabilities of the Ninja CFP301. For those seeking an all-in-one solution across coffee styles, this coffee maker carves its niche brilliantly.  

**Affordable Quality**  
The price-to-quality ratio of this machine is compelling. With no need to buy separate frothers or worry about compatibility between single-serve pods and ground coffee, its multitasking capability makes it a smart purchase. While there are slightly cheaper machines in the market, you’d be hard-pressed to find one that competes in terms of brewing speed, versatility, and user customization. **Want Ninja CFP301?

**1.** Focus & Presence

When I was younger, before college, I’d hear people say:  
*""You’re not really present your mind’s somewhere else, thinking about work.""*

I’d laugh internally. *""That won’t be me. I’m not that busy. I’ll never let work hijack my brain like that.""*

But here I am, final year of engineering, running my own company, something I dreamed of, worked for, and now it’s real.

When I’m alone, thinking about work feels normal. Expected.  
But even when I’m with friends or family, I catch myself half listening.  
I’m nodding, maybe throwing in a comment, but my brain’s running sprint drills over tasks, bugs, features, deadlines.  
Their stories turn into background noise.

I’m physically there, but mentally in a completely different zone.

And that’s the part that bothers me because maybe this isn’t just about “being busy.”  
Maybe I’ve genuinely forgotten how to be *present*.  
I genuinely stopped caring, like.. how my mother spent her day or how my friend's month been. I ask, but I don't remember nor do I listen.  
It saddens me coz I'm not going to have them around all the time ryt?

I need to be present, care but I frogot how to do that, being in the moment.

**2.** I Am So Lonely

This part’s harder to admit.

I’ve never had a romantic relationship. Not because I’m against it, I’ve just been waiting for someone who really fits.

I don’t open up emotionally. I have about five close friends, but we don’t talk about feelings.  
They see me as “that guy” the one who always knows what to say, who fixes things, who’s solid. I give advice. I give clarity.

One of them hugged me once after I helped him through something and I felt… awkward.  
Physical affection doesn’t land for me. Except from my dad on rare occasions.  
I grew up in a warm, expressive household. But somewhere along the line, I shut down.  
Stopped showing emotions. Now it’s default.

Here’s the truth: I am so lonely.

Not physically, there are people around who care.  
But emotionally? I feel like I’m sealed off inside a wall I built years ago.

I crave love. Softness. Connection. A voice that says, *“I love you so much, come here.”*

When that craving gets too loud, I turn to music.  
Not loud music, just slow, love songs, usually sung from a woman’s perspective.  
It makes me imagine someone singing them to me. Even though I know she doesn’t exist, I keep feeding the fantasy.

It wasn’t always like this.  
When I was driving, I used to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, other people’s experiences, things to grow from.  
Now it’s just love songs.  
It’s like my subconscious swapped self-growth for self-comfort.

I’ve even avoided coffee and tea my whole life because I believe they slow the brain long-term.  
But lately, I’m slipping into habits that don’t help.  
The songs aren’t about enjoying music they’re about filling the silence in my head that feels like loneliness echoing back at me.

And then I look at the dating scene and I think:  
*What if the one I’m waiting for doesn’t exist?*  
*What if all I find are people who don’t match me, who don’t feel like home?*

Sometimes I wonder if this isn’t just “my issue” maybe it’s biology.  
Humans are wired to pair up, to have a partner.  
And now that I’m building my life, the only missing piece feels like… her.

So I ask you:

Is this something I’m meant to just power through and grow from?  
Or am I romanticizing my weaknesses so I don’t have to face them?

Inshort :

1. Even with friends/family, I find myself thinking about work instead of actually listening. I’m never fully present. Is this a phase or a deeper disconnect from them or myself?
2. I’ve never had emotional intimacy. I crave love so much that I listen to love songs even while driving and imagine they’re about me. I’m lonely, and I don’t know what else to do, this emptiness, is hurting my self growth, hurting my ability to grasp knowledge.. growing my mind.

I'm a solo founder and, like many of you, I'm obsessed with optimizing my workflow. My biggest personal pain point was task management on the go. The constant context-switching to open a to-do app was a focus killer. It felt like a solvable problem, so I decided to solve it myself.

For the last 2 months, I've been heads-down building Sched AI. It's not another to-do list; it's a workflow layer. The core feature is an edge panel overlay that lets you manage your entire task list without ever leaving the app you're in.

**The Build :**

* **Timeframe:** 2 months, nights and weekends.
* **Biggest Challenge:** Getting the overlay to perform smoothly without draining battery was a nightmare, but I finally cracked it.

**The Business & Early Numbers:** This is where I'd love your brutal feedback. I'm validating the monetization strategy now.

* **Model:** Testing a freemium model. Core functionality is free, with a premium tier at **$1.99/month**. My thesis is that power users who value focus will happily pay less than a coffee for it. Too cheap? Too expensive?
* **Waitlist:** Currently at \[**e.g., 2.8k+ signups**\] from some early posts.
* **Alpha Tester Metrics (n=\~25 users):**
   * **Retention:** 89% after 30 days. This is the metric that tells me I'm onto something.
   * **Engagement:** Average task capture time is down to 4 seconds.
   * **Qualitative Feedback:** Users are reporting a ""dramatic"" difference in daily flow, which was the goal.

**The Ask:** I haven't launched on the Play Store yet. Before I do, I want to get this in front of people who understand the grind. I would be immensely grateful for your honest, no-holds-barred feedback on the landing page and the pricing strategy.

As such, this flavor run through for pints has most likely surpassed my previous cumulative experience of the last 10 years. So fairly unbiased and fresh.

Background of my palate: I am very partial to extreme flavors over ""basic"", ""regular"" ones. I never order standard/singular flavors e.g. vanilla or chocolate. Mint choc chip is the bare minimum to consider. Rocky Road was my very first favorite flavor. I would prefer more sweet over subtler flavor, but do recognize excessive sweetness. I prioritize the ice cream over the mix-ins but consider the overall experience and cohesive flavor more important.

Rum Tres Leches (Haagen Dazs)

Medium-Strong base Rum flavor. Shared with a friend, who immediately commented saying it was a whiskey flavor without knowing. She managed to resist after 6 spoonfuls. Big and plentiful tres leches cake pieces. They are dense and chewy with a good sweet cake flavor.

8.75/10

Irish Cream Brownie (Haagen Dazs)

Medium base Irish Cream flavor. Had a taste and immediately thought I made a mistake by not having a cup of coffee with it. The brownie is very dense, you need to use elbow grease to scrape through the veins. Its also a deep chocolate flavor.

8/10

Double Belgian Chocolate Chip (Haagen Dazs)

Rich, strong chocolate base flavor. Enough to take note on the first bite. The chocolate chip is like a shredded texture. Like shaving dark chocolate with a cheese grater. Like the coffee filter fines that get into the cup x100. This leads to a rich smooth chocolate ice cream while chewing on a crispy chocolate tv static.

8.25/10

Triple Chocolate Fudge Cookie (Haagen Dazs)

Medium Basic base chocolate flavor. Tasted immediately after Double Belgian to compare the loss in richness. This is the point where I noticed HD goes OD on their MI. This is literally at least 50% not ice cream. The fudge swirl and chocolate cookie dominates the density. Every bite is a coating of sweet chocolate, as in they make sure that all 3 chocolates are present in at least equal amounts.

7.25/10

Dulce de Leche Churro (Haagen Dazs)
The GOAT. A quarter through the pint and decided it's tier 1. I will be getting 2 of this during the next sale. Maybe more depending on impulse.

Intense cinnamon base flavor. Sweet to the point of noticing. I immediately identified cinnamon and got confused thinking it would be a dulce de leche base. The veins of dulce de leche swirl are thick throughout. The churro pieces are GMO. They are huge, they are everywhere, they are alternating between crispy-crunchy and crispy-chewy depending on that piece's ability to soak in the ice cream i guess. Both textures are amazing and i feel no perception of a lack of quality, just recognition that even these soggy pieces are of high quality to begin with.

Again with Haagen dazs almost overdoing it with the mix ins. Depending on your spooning habits, you basically have to do spoon scalpel surgery or scrape snow off the windshield so to speak in order to get just the base ice cream. Bigger scoops will guarantee to have a churro piece, and/or some dulce de leche swirl with it. You will have zero effort finding the next churro piece to shovel into the next spoon if thats your intention.

9.25/10

Topped Bossin Cream Pie (B&J)

The chocolate topping layer was decently thick and rich in flavor. It paired nicely with the ice cream; however this is only where I really enjoyed it, with the base vanilla flavor and pastry cream swirls giving a *peculiar light cakey flavor that I didnt particularly enjoy much. It was kind of a slog to get through by the end.

Because HD got me noticing, outside of the massive layer of chocolate that starts the pints of Topped, across B&J's the mixins are less prevalent. The ice cream might be a tiny bit less dense as well, but its still good.

7.25/10 (Topped with ice cream) 7/10 (Ice Cream)

Topped Tiramisu (B&J)

Prewarning that I've only had tiramisu once or twice and cant readily describe it.

Definitely a lighter ""concept"" of flavor compared to other things. The base ice cream flavor was there, but not easily identified. The fudge swirls were occasional, while the shortbread ""cookies"" was thoroughly homogenously blended into the ice cream.

Cannot remember any coffee notes. Not even in the ganache espresso topping layer. Tasted like the one in Bossin Cream Pie.

This and previous experiences has left me with the impression that tiramisu should be its own thing done right originally instead of as a flavor inspiration.

7.75/10 (Topped with Ice Cream) 7.25/10 (Ice Cream)

Churray for Churros (B&J)

Lets get it out of the way. Haagen Dazs's Dulce de Leche Churro got it beat. Buttery Cinnamon ice cream means the cinnamon is less pronounced. It says churro pieces and crunchy cinnamon swirls but its pretty homogeneous and very similar textures in the final product. 

By halfway I was wishing it was a pint of the HD DLC. I am literally using this flavor to hype up another brand's better flavor. My memory of this flavor is of pining for another.

7.5/10

Mousse Pie (B&J)

I dont know why I expected more. Vaguely might shift your dessert perception from ice cream to the realm of pudding, but not really. The 3 different chocolate options' flavors kind of blend together similarly outside of the moderate textural changes between them. I have no real praises to say.

7/10

Caramel Chocolate Cheesecake (B&J's)

Eating as I type.

Wow. This is good. Sweet base ice cream flavor. Took a bit of scoops before hitting swirl, which has crispyness. I am not a cheesecake man. I never get cheesecake. This ice cream flavor is my first intentional sit through experience with cheesecake in any form. So I actually scooped out a piece and scraped off the ice cream to isolate it. Chewing and tasting. The color grey and the word PHILADELPHIA faded into view then faded out. Which was an experience which made me appreciate dairy more deeply.

Because that was not enjoyable. Cream cheese belongs in savory. With breakfast toasted bread, like a bagel. Not ice cream. Which brings my aversion to cheesecake into perspective. I hate how cheesecakes are fruit flavored, like strawberry or lemon. I hate fruit. But, more to my issue, I dont like sweet cream cheese. Even oreo cheesecakes are not something i'd voluntarily choose at all.

Still eating as I type, and just now I scooped out a massive cheesecake chunk, not exaggerating, the entire piece filled 40% of closed mouth interior. Wow, a huge mixin from a real whole cheesecake, thats great right? Nope. Chewing it and getting a massive dose of cream cheese flavor, chewing a block of cream cheese with a dose of sweet ice cream I realized something. Cream cheese is a cheese. Its not cream. Cheese and Cream should not mix. Cheese is cheese because it is savory. Cheese is dinner, cream is dessert. Cream cheese, and cheesecake, is trying to be something its not. 

I just ate another massive cheesecake mixin, exactly what I'm talking about. A sweet ice cream and swirl duo then this coating of cream cheese smothers the mouth with a distinctive grey blah play doh chewy flavor (that is distinctly not sweet like the caramel ice cream and chocolate cookie swirl it obscures) and texture until you swallow.

Just finished the pint. I know I would not buy it again. However, I crave more. But, its in that dairy craving way, not in a missing it way. You know how your limit is 3 hamburgers, but 5 cheeseburgers? Yeah. Cream cheese is a cheese and doesnt belong in ice cream or as a cake.

The massive size of the cheesecake pieces is twice as big as the Haagen Dazs churros, so Ben & Jerry's has the record. That point works against it, as for me, it made me realize I dont like cheesecake, and therefore, this flavor. However, real recognize real, and if you do like it, then holy fuck, it was a literal cubic inch of solid chewy frozen cheesecake.

7.75/10 I'd give the edge to Topped Tiramisu (no homo) (I'm eating B&J's)

Chocolate Therapy (B&J's)

This one lives up to its name actually. Its circular and confusing at times. Eating as I type.

The base chocolate ice cream flavor is has good depth of flavor, not as much as Haagen Daz's Belgian Chocolate chip, but above the base Triple Chocolate Fudge Cookie. Then you get these veins of chocolate pudding ice cream which are darker in flavor and look and texture, which is dense and fudgey and has tiny crunchy bits, like carvel cake chocolate gravel crunchies at 1/10th frequency.

It doesnt help that I'm eating this in the dark not really looking at it. A purely taste sensory experience, its really just 2 flavor shades of chocolate ice cream: traditional milk vs fudgey puddingy chocolate, looking forward to the small treat of a cookie crunchie pebble.

Eating in the light doesnt really help, digging to a level where it was yin and yang Chocobase - Chocopudding. I then discovered that the crunchies were provided randomly in the chocopudding areas. This leads to compulsive preferential scooping and the loss of the element of surprise.

8.25/10 Anything with crunchy chocolate cookies at that particular texture is boosted. Its nowhere near as much as you want. its 2-3 consecutive scoops with 1-2 crunchies in it, then occasionally none at all. The one flavor B&J's minimized the mix in to the bottom limit, and its the one I wanted the complete maximum. Amazing.

Conclusion

Overall, Haagen Dazs is a more consistently enjoyable exotic brand than Ben & Jerry's. Minimally better base ice cream quality (nitpicking, possibly making it up), more intense ice cream base flavors, more frequent and higher quality and heterogeneous mix in compositions. Its like Ben and Jerry's flavors are not just a blend of ingredients, but actually mechanically blended somewhat; with the exception of caramel cheesecake, which used a premium process for a dairy cousin ingredient.

Moving forward, I will be completely ignoring Ben & Jerry's, I have reached acceptance on the eventual death of Colbert's flavor (I've never tried it and now dont care to.), and am now a Dazs-rider. However, after letting it rest and process, I have envisioned myself some time in the future maturing on cheesecake, as I would not necessarily say no to a free pint of CCC this very moment.

1modn2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1modn2r/what_makes_the_bodum_brazil_french_press_a_top/,What Makes the Bodum Brazil French Press a Top Coffee Maker? Review,"The **Bodum 1548-01US Brazil French Press Coffee Maker** is one product I’ve grown particularly fond of during my daily coffee rituals. Its design, functionality, and budget-friendly approach make it a stand-out choice among coffee enthusiasts. Though it’s not without minor imperfections, this French press certainly has some winning qualities.

**Sleek Yet Functional Design**  
This coffee maker is a great example of how aesthetics and functionality coexist. The borosilicate glass carafe is durable and crystal clear, giving you a front-row seat as your coffee brews. Its BPA-free plastic body, handle, and lid feel lightweight but surprisingly sturdy, making it easy to handle even when filled to its 34-ounce capacity. I personally like the minimalist vibe it adds to my countertop – simple yet elegant. However, handling the glass carafe requires caution since it still feels slightly less reinforced than metal alternatives. 

**Using the French Press Daily**  
As someone who wakes up half-asleep some mornings, the simplicity of this manual coffee brewer is a blessing. Just grind some beans, add hot water, let it steep, and press down the stainless-steel plunger. I’ve tested it with various roasts and grind sizes, and let me say – the flavors it extracts are remarkable. There's no better way to start a morning than with the full-bodied coffee it produces. Plus, the reusable mesh filter means there’s no fumbling with paper filters as you’re trying to brew your caffeine fix.

[Check Bodum 1548-01US price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b000kem4tq/)

**Strong Points**  
- The permanent stainless-steel filter ensures no flavor is lost to paper absorption.  
- Compact and lightweight, perfect for limited counter space or travelling.  
- Environmentally friendly since it doesn’t rely on disposable pods or filters.  
- Easy to take apart and clean, making maintenance a simple task.

**Limitations**  
- The plastic body, while sturdy, may appear less premium than higher-end materials.  
- No insulation for the glass carafe, so coffee can cool quickly without transfer to a thermal holder.  
- The design doesn’t cater well to larger crowds – it’s an 8-cup max capacity.  

**Ease of Cleaning**  
This French press fits my busy schedule perfectly when it comes to cleanup. After the coffee is done, the parts – including the glass carafe, plunger, and filter – are all dishwasher-safe, which is an underrated convenience. On days when I opt for hand washing, it’s just a simple rinse and wipe. There’s no fussing with delicate elements or intricate designs. That said, it does need regular cleanup since any leftover grounds can stick to the filter, and you absolutely don’t want stale grinds affecting tomorrow’s brew.

**How Does It Compare to Competitors?**  
Stacked against competitors like the Aeropress or a pour-over brewer, each has its strengths. While the Aeropress is more portable and caters to single servings, it lacks the traditional full-bodied richness only a French press delivers. Pour-over methods like the Chemex are fancier, but they’re trickier to use and heavily reliant on filter availability. The Brazil French Press strikes a balance: it’s affordable, practical, and captures the natural oils and flavors you’d often lose when using paper-filter systems. On the downside, I wouldn’t call it as insulated as pricier thermal carafes from other leading brands like Frieling, which do a better job of maintaining temperature over time.

**Budget-Friendly Brewing**  
Regarding affordable quality, this item punches above its price point. While many are tempted by cutting-edge espresso machines or other complex coffee-making systems, this durable French press achieves rich coffee without blowing your budget. Its long-lasting stainless-steel filter and reusable design mean there’s no guilt about ongoing consumable costs like paper filters or pods. Plus, it stands up well to repeated use – I’ve brewed coffee daily for weeks with absolutely no signs of wear.

1modmde,https://www.reddit.com/r/btsthoughts/comments/1modmde/what_if_i_ask_you_to_strictly_rank_bts_albums/,What if I ask you to strictly rank bts albums according to your preference?,"Bts have 15 korean albums (7 mini albums, 4 full albums, 3 repackage albums, and 1 single album)

Obviously each album has it's own style so people rarely agree on how to rank them. I'm curious though about the fans different perspectives. 

Here is my current ranking btw:

1. LY Tear
2. HYYH Pt.2
3. LY Her
4. Wings 
5. HYYH Pt.1
6. You Never Walk Alone
7. Dark & Wild
8. Skool Luv Affair
9. Young Forever 
10. Persona 
11. MOTS 7
12. BE
13. LY Answer 
14. O!RUL8,2?
15. 2Cool 4Skool


My top2 remain unchanged, lowkey my fav korean albums ever. And maybe because of the summer but I came to appreciate Her alot lately, I've been a huge fan of it since its release but I would usually still rank it below Wings. Also imo bts 2013 two albums are often a bit overrated by nostalgia fans because of a standout song or two (e.g. Like & Coffee) when all the albums that came after them were much better. On the other hand I ranked Dark & Wild at 7 on the list but it's a well executed hip hop album. 

Persona is my 10th mostly because the other albums are just better but it's still mostly a solid one. MOTS 7 had quite a bunch of good songs but also had some that I didn't like at all so it took some fall. It still has its magic though. And Answer might have been right below BE but the gap is *big*. 


However important thing to note: ranking aside, I think out of all of these albums the one that is the most difficult to recreate is Wings/YNWA, like I can totally see why it's the album that got bts alot of international recognition and frankly if bts released it today the reactions would've been explosive. I just prefer and listen to the top2 albums more.

1modlji,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1modlji/such_was_the_cruelty_of_her_peculiar_blessing/,Such was the Cruelty of Her Peculiar Blessing.,"

Athena bristled at the soft creaking of stubborn wood coming from the corner of her moonlit bedroom. She tried to temper her excitement. The groans and whines of her old home had tricked her many times before, and even if the soft creaking was a harbinger of his arrival, as opposed to meaningless white noise, that didn’t guarantee he’d perform the heinous and specific act she so badly wanted him to. 

*It could be nothing*, she thought. 

Silence returned. Before she could completely discard her excitement, Athena felt the icy whisper of night air. It squeezed itself under the edge of her mask and began licking at her cheek. 

Finally, after months of patience and hard work, someone had opened her window in the dead of night. 

*I suppose it could be an unrelated intruder*; she considered. 

Hope sunk its teeth deep, and she banished the consideration from her mind. 

*No - it must be him. I mean, what are the odds?*

Slow, deliberate footsteps marked his approach. Athena shifted, faking a quick snore and angling her face away from the intruder. She hoped her neck looked tantalizing in the moonlight: a nice tenderloin cut for the butcher creeping through her room. She had purposefully been sleeping under a large, heavy comforter in such a way that the only skin left showing was from her neck up. It was a silent suggestion. Subliminal coercion to get what she wanted without asking. 

The rules of her blessing forbade Athena from asking. Or, more accurately, the result would be less than ideal if she asked for it. She’d learned that lesson the hard way, and this modification was too important to fuck up by circumventing the rules. 

The footsteps stopped at the side of her bed. His breathing was labored and vigorous, almost coital in its intensity. 

This is it. This is the moment. 

*Faceless killer, grant me rebirth*, she beseeched. 

Then, he struck. 

His cleaver came crashing down into her abdomen. 

He paused, tilting his head slightly. Something didn’t feel right. He couldn’t smell liberated blood, the intoxicating scent of hot copper bursting from a fresh wound. Not only that, but the blow itself was dry and joyless. There was no squish. No pulp. 

No scream, either. 

Confusion quickly turned to rage. He ripped the blade out of her abdomen, arched it over his shoulder, and brought it down again, aiming for the center of her chest as outlined by the comforter. 

Still, nothing. 

For a moment, he wondered if there was anyone under the blanket at all, but the commotion had caused his would-be victim’s hand to peek out and drape over the bedframe. He wasted no time in severing the appendage, convinced that would finally produce the desired effect. 

Flesh and bone hit the wood floor with a dull *thump*. 

Silence followed. 

The butcher didn’t understand. 

Something was desperately, desperately wrong. 

He bent down and picked it up by the wrist. The tissue was warm, but disturbingly dry. He dragged his fingertips over the saw-toothed incision, feeling fragmented bone tent his skin. That’s when he noticed the size of the hand. It was large, with hairy knuckles and a calloused palm. His eyes drifted back to his target. The body under the blanket looked female: an hourglass figure with discernible breasts and rich, mahogany-colored hair. Surely, this was the woman he’d been conversing with for months now - another love-struck piglet tempting him to leave his wife. To his knowledge, he hadn’t ever killed an innocent before. 

Somehow, though, the hand didn’t appear to match. 

Meanwhile, Athena’s patience was beginning to wear thin. 

Third time’s a charm, he supposed, never one to overthink a situation. Another wild swing collided with Athena. He intended to bury the cleaver into her brain, but it bounced off her skull. 

That’s not possible, he thought. 

So he swung again. And again. And again. Each time, the blade was rejected. No amount of force would penetrate the patch of flesh above her ear. On his seventh attempt, he made a fatal error. 

The cleaver struck her forehead, creating a minor dent in her mask. 

Now this she would not abide. 

Athena sprung up like a bear trap, landing on all fours with the grace of a seasoned predator, blocking his only exit. He jumped back, watching in horror as she creaked upright, joints clicking and cracking like Roman candles. The whispers of night air emanating from the open window whistled a bevy of secrets through her white satin negligee, causing the ends to billow. 

He extended a trembling hand towards Athena, cleaver rattling against his wedding ring. The butcher couldn’t recall the last time his hand trembled. Maybe since his first kill, and that was a long, long time ago. 

*”All those months being subjected to your drivel - hundreds and hundreds of emails - and it’s all going to be for naught,”* Athena whispered. 

Determining his identity and luring him into her home was no small feat. 

*”You’ve done it before, no? Decapitated your victims pre-mortem?”*

He couldn’t find anything to say in response. 

Athena looked the butcher up and down. This killer had eluded the FBI for over a decade, but he was no Hellspawn. No infallible mastermind. He was just some *man* - stocky with dyed gray hair and an overbite. 

She slinked forward. 

He found himself unable to move. 

*”Where’s your voice, sweet child? What happened to your silver tongue? I’ve read your manifesto. You’re so tiringly verbose when you’re taunting the police, but now, in person, you have nothing to say?”*

Athena ran a shriveled tongue along her artificial dentition, counting the number of teeth, making sure they were all still there. Thanks to the blessing, her original, adult teeth had fallen out over a century ago, and they were one of the few body parts that wouldn’t be cosmically replaced while she slept. At the time, it was only a slight setback, and she quickly made do. 

Gums gleaming with sewing needles were intimidating, sure, but it was uncomfortable and challenging to maintain. The situation was razor blades with similar. Eventually, the solution became apparent to Athena, and although it was laughably obvious, it hadn’t jumped to the forefront of her mind because she looked so young back then. 

What do adults do when they lose their teeth? 

Well, they get dentures, of course. 

She reached behind her head and unfastened the ribbon that kept her precious mask on tight. The pale metal face of a beautiful woman fell from her own, taking the luscious, mahogany-colored hair with it. She grinned at the butcher, baring a mouthful of permanently borrowed teeth. Most were human, excluding her incisors: those had first belonged to a bull shark. 

Athena thought they were a good touch.

She allowed the butcher a few more seconds to respond. Dying words were a basic human right. Civility dictated she afford him said rights. Athena held onto a perverse sense of civility because it made her feel human. Moreover, it couldn’t be cut from her, therefore, it couldn’t be replaced by her blessing. 

He couldn’t comprehend the face that hid behind the mask, paralyzed as two bright white pinpoints bored into him from the depths of two empty sockets. The light seemed to extend into her skull for miles and was almost angelic in its purity. 

*Time’s up*, Athena thought. 

“Disappointing,” she murmured.

The predator unhinged her jaw and lunged at the butcher. 

- - - - - 

Before the blessing, Athena’s body had intended to die sometime during the nineteenth century, though nowadays she found the details surrounding her blessing hazy. Not only were they buried under the thick sediment of time, but those crucial details were outshone by the memories of her life directly *after* the blessing. It was the peak after all; she had never been happier. 

That said, she would frequently chastise her younger self for not having the presence of mind to write anything down. Gods, however small, need historians. How else could they keep track of something as vast as reality? 

*Why can’t I recall where this blessing came from?* She’d often wonder. 

From there, a bout of pointless speculation was inevitable.

Athena enjoyed killing - thoroughly and without regret. Had she won this blessing through some blood-soaked ritual combat? Appeased the right voodoo master with her love of the craft? Alternatively, her murderous proclivities could be a byproduct of her immortality, rather than the catalyst of it. She killed for all sorts of reasons back then, after all. For profit. For revenge. For love. For fun. Being freed of death certainly cheapened her evaluation of life. Perhaps her infatuation with carnage was downstream of that. 

So, maybe her blessing wasn’t a prize granted on account of her bloodlust. Was part of a deal? Had she given something up in exchange for it? A Faustian bargain with a poorly disguised devil? Athena could vaguely recall feeling weak and ill prior to her blessing - maybe she accepted some devil’s terms to outmaneuver death. She regularly had dreams of a man offering her something in one of the many cobblestone alleyways present in her home country. His face is always obscured, cloaked within the soft embrace of a moonless night, excluding his eyes. They were like her own as of late: narrow beams of pearly light radiating from a pair of shadow-cast sockets. 

Of course, that was all conjecture. Speculations based on an assortment of other speculations. Perhaps she felt weak and ill *because* of the blessing’s transformative power. Perhaps the man in her dreams was simply a figment of her imagination, reconciling the horror of her existence. There was no way to verify any of it, and if she dwelled on her nebulous history for too long, she’d inevitably arrive at her least favorable theory. 

Maybe she hadn’t been granted a blessing. 

Maybe she’d been cursed. 

- - - - -

By the time Athena was plodding up the cellar stairs, finally finished with the laborious task of burying the butcher, it was nearly sunup. She wasn’t thrilled with the prospect of going without her right hand for the whole damn day, so sleep was of paramount importance. Athena dumped her dirt-covered boots inside her bathtub, pulled open her medicine cabinet and procured a handful of Benadryl, downing the pink tabs in a single swallow. 

She *almost* forgot she wasn’t wearing her precious mask.

She *almost* saw her reflection in the mirror as the medicine cabinet swung closed. 

Thankfully, Athena twisted her body away from the glass at the last second, flipping around to face a wall covered in peeling, jaundiced wallpaper. Staring at the decaying cellulose was the first free moment she’d had since the butcher snuck in. 

In one swift motion, she thrust her handless stub through the wall.

Athena did not scream. She wanted to, but couldn’t. The catharsis wasn’t advisable. 

If her neighbors called the police, who knows what would happen.

She didn’t have the energy for more violence, nor did she have the will to skip town. Not again. 

Athena was much, much too exhausted. 

- - - - -

Her wounds hurt, but they wouldn’t bleed. It was the same with lost limbs. She’d forgone the need for the iron-bound liquid, apparently. One of the many strange facets of her ambiguous immortality, but it wasn’t the strangest. 

No, that honor was reserved for the way her body healed. 

It would go like this: 

Athena would sustain damage. In the short term, nothing would happen. Lacerations wouldn’t spontaneously close like a cluster of microscopic nanobots were tasked with keeping her whole. Limbs wouldn’t immediately start growing back like the buds of a rapidly maturing plant. The process was much less…biologic. Her invulnerability lacked a defined scientific rationale. Her blessing refused such constraints. She would fall asleep, and when she awoke, everything would be back in working order. Everything that had been severed, burnt, crushed, or otherwise damaged would be replaced. Those replacements weren’t a copy designed from her original body. They were different: pieces that seemed to have been borrowed from someone else, though it was never clear from whom.

When Athena lost a sheet of flank skin to an axe swipe, what she awoke with was an entirely different skin tone, but it covered the damaged area completely. 

When Athena forfeit a hand to the maw of a hydraulic press, the hand that returned nearly matched her natural complexion, but it appeared much younger. The nails were painted cherry-red, too. She liked that. From then on, she painted all of her nails that way.

And when Athena mangled her left foot after a nasty, four-story fall, the foot that replaced hers was hideous: gnarled and disease-ridden. Obsidian toenails above water-logged, gray-skinned toes. Almost looked like the ivory keys of a grand piano. She despised it. Athena didn’t consider herself vain, but at the same time, she found this particular replacement abhorrent and, ultimately, intolerable. 

So, one evening, she drove a machete through the garish limb, right above the ankle. Threw the pitiable thing in a nearby dumpster. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, playful curiosity swimming in her heart. 

*I wonder what’ll be there in the morning.*

She awoke at the break of dawn. Not gently. Not to the chiming of an alarm. 

Athena awoke in a state of absolute, undiluted agony. 

Whatever was now below her ankle seethed with pain. Wails erupted from her vocal cords. She ripped the blanket off her body. 

What she found was a cluster of blackened flesh writhing where that diseased limb had previously been attached. 

Glistening black tubes, tangled together like the intertwined tails of a rat king. There were mounds of raised mucosa scattered within the mass that resembled lips - pink, wet, and plump - never paired to form something as recognizable as a mouth. Between the tubes and the singular lips, deep within the eldritch bedlam, there looked to be dozens of lidless, colorless eyes, aggregated like grapes, staring at nothing or at everything - it was impossible to tell. 

The smell was horrific, but the sound was worse: a cacophony of moist sloshing with intermittent clicks and belches filled Athena’s ears. 

Although the experience was traumatic, she was still very lucky that day. When she ran out into the street, screaming like a maniac, ambulation crooked on account of her poor excuse for a foot, the horrified townsfolk who gunned her down had excellent aim. Hot metal eviscerated the ball of incomprehensible meat attached to her leg. Of course, they did a number on Athena as well. That’s when the final, most important quirk of her blessing became apparent.

A hail of bullets unilaterally ravaged her body - all but her skull and the skin that covered it, that is. 

For whatever reason, that bone and its casing had become truly invulnerable. 

Athena dragged herself into a nearby forest, bruised, ragged and bleeding. When she could move no longer, she fell asleep under a maple tree, a malformed husk of her former self. 

Dawn once again crested over the horizon. When she awoke, each and every injury had been healed. 

Each and every injury had been healed *separately*, that is. 

The bullet hole through the back of her neck had been repaired with a different piece of tissue when compared to the bullet hole through her sternum, her left kneecap, her collarbone - so on and so on. She was inexplicably healed, yes, but asides from her consciousness, Athena wasn’t herself anymore. Excluding her face and skull, she had become a patchwork golem - a quilt stitched together from scraps of nameless skin and sinew. 

In theory, that arrangement would have been perfectly fine. There was only one problem. 

Any and all flesh she owned was still subject to the demands of rot and decay, even if it couldn’t earnestly die while still attached to her and her blessing. Thus, her head had become withered and gaunt after a century of gradual denigration. Athena’s visage was one of living death, and if she wanted that to change, it seemed to her like she would need to be fully decapitated. 

But if she wanted to avoid her head becoming a wriggling globe of tubes and eyes,

She couldn’t do it herself. 

- - - - - 

The day after the butcher’s untimely demise, Athena stirred around noon. She felt her new hand before she saw it, wiggling her replaced fingers under the comforter to confirm the machinery was in working order. She slid over to the side of the bed. The faint scent of dried blood still lingered in the air, but it didn’t inspire deep satisfaction and a sense of vitality. Not like it used to. 

With a sigh, she headed to the kitchen. Didn’t even bother to inspect the hand on the way there. She could evaluate the appendage for diseases and defects with her fingers wrapped around a hot cup of coffee. 

The skin was bronze and smooth. Transplanted from a young Mediterranean woman, perhaps. The top third of a tattoo was visible on the underside of her wrist. It was dull red and curved. Maybe part of a rose petal? Or a heart? Hard to say. After about an inch, the pigment abruptly cut off, transitioning into an unrelated patch of pale white skin. The echoes of a different injury she couldn’t quite remember.

Athena considered digging through her junk drawer. Her favorite crimson nail polish was in the compartment somewhere. Maybe that’d make her feel better: an old ritual to remind her of happier times. It would match the tattoo, at least. 

*”What’s the point…”* she whispered, placing her mug onto the countertop and leaning her dessicated head against the wall. Painting her nails was akin to lobbing a handful of ice cubes over the rim of a volcano and expecting the temperature to change. 

She was an abomination. 

Athena pulled her head from the wall and spun around to face the kitchen table. Lying in the center was her dented mask. It was the last authentic piece of herself she had left. From what she could recall, she’d commissioned the mask from a local metalworker, back when her face was just aged and not frankly rotten. It was based on an old photograph of herself that she’d since lost. 

Her eyes drifted to the cellar door. 

Maybe it was finally time for Plan B. 

Suddenly, she felt something. A forgotten emotion fluttering around in her chest. 

Purpose? Meaning? Momentum? It was something that lay at the intersection of those feelings. She hung on to it for dear life and paced towards the door. 

*Why am I resisting? What am I even holding on to?*

*I’m not human. I’m not anyone. I’m not even Athena - not anymore.*

I’m an abomination. 

Might as well look like one. 

At the very back of the cellar, across the dirt-covered floor turned graveyard, there was a wooden device she had built a long time ago: a hanging blade, a lever, and a place to put her head. 

Athena’s makeshift guillotine. 

She didn’t slow down. She didn’t stop to consider her options. She knew that might steer her away from her current course of action. 

*So what if my head becomes a bouquet of eyes and lips and black flesh?*

*At least I’ll know what I am, and I won’t be stuck in between.*

*And I mean, who knows?*

*Maybe nothing will sprout from the wound.*

*Maybe everything will go black.*

*Maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll die.*

Athena wasn’t walking anymore. She was running. She scrambled to the ground, throwing her head into the hole with reckless abandon. 

*Maybe I’ll truly be free.*

She pulled the lever, and the blade fell. 

Her head landed on the floor with a sickening *thud*.

For a moment, the world did go black.

But that was only because she’d closed her eyes. 

When they opened, she was staring at a latticework of dust-covered wooden beams.

Because *of course* she hadn’t died.

Her blessing simply wouldn’t allow it. 

It was an impulsive mistake - one that she sorely regretted moments after pulling the lever, sure, but that was only a fraction of the total regret she’d feel a day and a half later. 

Eventually, she fell asleep. 

When Athena awoke, she couldn’t see the wriggling mass of tubes of eyes that was born of her mistake, blossoming from the bottom of her severed head. 

But she could feel the pain of it all.

She could smell its cadaverous scent. 

Worst of all, she could hear its endless squirming - the sloshing and the clicking and the bubbling of fetid gas. 

And there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it. 

Although she could not recall his words, her fate was exactly as The Red Priest had advertised. 

*”Oh, no, dear. You, as you are currently, won’t live on forever with my God’s help. There isn’t a blessing for something so…unnatural. The soul will not stagnate. It’s against its divine composition. It will always change. But your body? Your soul’s earthly prison? Now that’s a different story…”*

1modkiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/1modkiy/my_struggle_or_my_excuse/,My Struggle or My Excuse?," I need to get it out of my head and onto a page. Maybe some of you have been here.

**1.** Focus & Presence

When I was younger, before college, I’d hear people say:  
*""You’re not really present your mind’s somewhere else, thinking about work.""*

I’d laugh internally. *""That won’t be me. I’m not that busy. I’ll never let work hijack my brain like that.""*

But here I am, final year of engineering, running my own company, something I dreamed of, worked for, and now it’s real.

When I’m alone, thinking about work feels normal. Expected.  
But even when I’m with friends or family, I catch myself half listening.  
I’m nodding, maybe throwing in a comment, but my brain’s running sprint drills over tasks, bugs, features, deadlines.  
Their stories turn into background noise.

I’m physically there, but mentally in a completely different zone.

And that’s the part that bothers me because maybe this isn’t just about “being busy.”  
Maybe I’ve genuinely forgotten how to be *present*.  
I genuinely stopped caring, like.. how my mother spent her day or how my friend's month been. I ask, but I don't remember nor do I listen.   
It saddens me coz I'm not going to have them around all the time ryt?

I need to be present, care but I frogot how to do that, being in the moment.   


**2.** I Am So Lonely

This part’s harder to admit.

I’ve never had a romantic relationship. Not because I’m against it, I’ve just been waiting for someone who really fits.

I don’t open up emotionally. I have about five close friends, but we don’t talk about feelings.  
They see me as “that guy” the one who always knows what to say, who fixes things, who’s solid. I give advice. I give clarity.

One of them hugged me once after I helped him through something  and I felt… awkward.  
Physical affection doesn’t land for me. Except from my dad on rare occasions.   
I grew up in a warm, expressive household. But somewhere along the line, I shut down.  
Stopped showing emotions. Now it’s default.

Here’s the truth: I am so lonely.

Not physically, there are people around who care.  
But emotionally? I feel like I’m sealed off inside a wall I built years ago.

I crave love. Softness. Connection. A voice that says, *“I love you so much, come here.”*

When that craving gets too loud, I turn to music.  
Not loud music, just slow, love songs, usually sung from a woman’s perspective.  
It makes me imagine someone singing them to me. Even though I know she doesn’t exist, I keep feeding the fantasy.

It wasn’t always like this.  
When I was driving, I used to listen to podcasts, audiobooks, other people’s experiences, things to grow from.  
Now it’s just love songs.  
It’s like my subconscious swapped self-growth for self-comfort.

I’ve even avoided coffee and tea my whole life because I believe they slow the brain long-term.  
But lately, I’m slipping into habits that don’t help.  
The songs aren’t about enjoying music they’re about filling the silence in my head that feels like loneliness echoing back at me.

And then I look at the dating scene and I think:  
*What if the one I’m waiting for doesn’t exist?*  
*What if all I find are people who don’t match me, who don’t feel like home?*

Sometimes I wonder if this isn’t just “my issue”  maybe it’s biology.  
Humans are wired to pair up, to have a partner.  
And now that I’m building my life, the only missing piece feels like… her.

So I ask you:

Is this something I’m meant to just power through and grow from?  
Or am I romanticizing my weaknesses so I don’t have to face them?

Inshort :  
1. Even with friends/family, I find myself thinking about work instead of actually listening. I’m never fully present. Is this a phase or a deeper disconnect from them or myself?  
2. I’ve never had emotional intimacy. I crave love so much that I listen to love songs  even while driving  and imagine they’re about me. I’m lonely, and I don’t know what else to do, this emptiness, is hurting my self growth, hurting my ability to grasp knowledge.. growing my mind. 

I don't know who you are, but I really appreciate you reading this, and would be great to hear your thoughts.

Athena bristled at the soft creaking of stubborn wood coming from the corner of her moonlit bedroom. She tried to temper her excitement. The groans and whines of her old home had tricked her many times before, and even if the soft creaking was a harbinger of his arrival, as opposed to meaningless white noise, that didn’t guarantee he’d perform the heinous and specific act she so badly wanted him to. 

*It could be nothing*, she thought. 

Silence returned. Before she could completely discard her excitement, Athena felt the icy whisper of night air. It squeezed itself under the edge of her mask and began licking at her cheek. 

Finally, after months of patience and hard work, someone had opened her window in the dead of night. 

*I suppose it could be an unrelated intruder*; she considered. 

Hope sunk its teeth deep, and she banished the consideration from her mind. 

*No - it must be him. I mean, what are the odds?*

Slow, deliberate footsteps marked his approach. Athena shifted, faking a quick snore and angling her face away from the intruder. She hoped her neck looked tantalizing in the moonlight: a nice tenderloin cut for the butcher creeping through her room. She had purposefully been sleeping under a large, heavy comforter in such a way that the only skin left showing was from her neck up. It was a silent suggestion. Subliminal coercion to get what she wanted without asking. 

The rules of her blessing forbade Athena from asking. Or, more accurately, the result would be less than ideal if she asked for it. She’d learned that lesson the hard way, and this modification was too important to fuck up by circumventing the rules. 

The footsteps stopped at the side of her bed. His breathing was labored and vigorous, almost coital in its intensity. 

This is it. This is the moment. 

*Faceless killer, grant me rebirth*, she beseeched. 

Then, he struck. 

His cleaver came crashing down into her abdomen. 

He paused, tilting his head slightly. Something didn’t feel right. He couldn’t smell liberated blood, the intoxicating scent of hot copper bursting from a fresh wound. Not only that, but the blow itself was dry and joyless. There was no squish. No pulp. 

No scream, either. 

Confusion quickly turned to rage. He ripped the blade out of her abdomen, arched it over his shoulder, and brought it down again, aiming for the center of her chest as outlined by the comforter. 

Still, nothing. 

For a moment, he wondered if there was anyone under the blanket at all, but the commotion had caused his would-be victim’s hand to peek out and drape over the bedframe. He wasted no time in severing the appendage, convinced that would finally produce the desired effect. 

Flesh and bone hit the wood floor with a dull *thump*. 

Silence followed. 

The butcher didn’t understand. 

Something was desperately, desperately wrong. 

He bent down and picked it up by the wrist. The tissue was warm, but disturbingly dry. He dragged his fingertips over the saw-toothed incision, feeling fragmented bone tent his skin. That’s when he noticed the size of the hand. It was large, with hairy knuckles and a calloused palm. His eyes drifted back to his target. The body under the blanket looked female: an hourglass figure with discernible breasts and rich, mahogany-colored hair. Surely, this was the woman he’d been conversing with for months now - another love-struck piglet tempting him to leave his wife. To his knowledge, he hadn’t ever killed an innocent before. 

Somehow, though, the hand didn’t appear to match. 

Meanwhile, Athena’s patience was beginning to wear thin. 

Third time’s a charm, he supposed, never one to overthink a situation. Another wild swing collided with Athena. He intended to bury the cleaver into her brain, but it bounced off her skull. 

That’s not possible, he thought. 

So he swung again. And again. And again. Each time, the blade was rejected. No amount of force would penetrate the patch of flesh above her ear. On his seventh attempt, he made a fatal error. 

The cleaver struck her forehead, creating a minor dent in her mask. 

Now this she would not abide. 

Athena sprung up like a bear trap, landing on all fours with the grace of a seasoned predator, blocking his only exit. He jumped back, watching in horror as she creaked upright, joints clicking and cracking like Roman candles. The whispers of night air emanating from the open window whistled a bevy of secrets through her white satin negligee, causing the ends to billow. 

He extended a trembling hand towards Athena, cleaver rattling against his wedding ring. The butcher couldn’t recall the last time his hand trembled. Maybe since his first kill, and that was a long, long time ago. 

*”All those months being subjected to your drivel - hundreds and hundreds of emails - and it’s all going to be for naught,”* Athena whispered. 

Determining his identity and luring him into her home was no small feat. 

*”You’ve done it before, no? Decapitated your victims pre-mortem?”*

He couldn’t find anything to say in response. 

Athena looked the butcher up and down. This killer had eluded the FBI for over a decade, but he was no Hellspawn. No infallible mastermind. He was just some *man* - stocky with dyed gray hair and an overbite. 

She slinked forward. 

He found himself unable to move. 

*”Where’s your voice, sweet child? What happened to your silver tongue? I’ve read your manifesto. You’re so tiringly verbose when you’re taunting the police, but now, in person, you have nothing to say?”*

Athena ran a shriveled tongue along her artificial dentition, counting the number of teeth, making sure they were all still there. Thanks to the blessing, her original, adult teeth had fallen out over a century ago, and they were one of the few body parts that wouldn’t be cosmically replaced while she slept. At the time, it was only a slight setback, and she quickly made do. 

Gums gleaming with sewing needles were intimidating, sure, but it was uncomfortable and challenging to maintain. The situation was razor blades with similar. Eventually, the solution became apparent to Athena, and although it was laughably obvious, it hadn’t jumped to the forefront of her mind because she looked so young back then. 

What do adults do when they lose their teeth? 

Well, they get dentures, of course. 

She reached behind her head and unfastened the ribbon that kept her precious mask on tight. The pale metal face of a beautiful woman fell from her own, taking the luscious, mahogany-colored hair with it. She grinned at the butcher, baring a mouthful of permanently borrowed teeth. Most were human, excluding her incisors: those had first belonged to a bull shark. 

Athena thought they were a good touch.

She allowed the butcher a few more seconds to respond. Dying words were a basic human right. Civility dictated she afford him said rights. Athena held onto a perverse sense of civility because it made her feel human. Moreover, it couldn’t be cut from her, therefore, it couldn’t be replaced by her blessing. 

He couldn’t comprehend the face that hid behind the mask, paralyzed as two bright white pinpoints bored into him from the depths of two empty sockets. The light seemed to extend into her skull for miles and was almost angelic in its purity. 

*Time’s up*, Athena thought. 

“Disappointing,” she murmured.

The predator unhinged her jaw and lunged at the butcher. 

- - - - - 

Before the blessing, Athena’s body had intended to die sometime during the nineteenth century, though nowadays she found the details surrounding her blessing hazy. Not only were they buried under the thick sediment of time, but those crucial details were outshone by the memories of her life directly *after* the blessing. It was the peak after all; she had never been happier. 

That said, she would frequently chastise her younger self for not having the presence of mind to write anything down. Gods, however small, need historians. How else could they keep track of something as vast as reality? 

*Why can’t I recall where this blessing came from?* She’d often wonder. 

From there, a bout of pointless speculation was inevitable.

Athena enjoyed killing - thoroughly and without regret. Had she won this blessing through some blood-soaked ritual combat? Appeased the right voodoo master with her love of the craft? Alternatively, her murderous proclivities could be a byproduct of her immortality, rather than the catalyst of it. She killed for all sorts of reasons back then, after all. For profit. For revenge. For love. For fun. Being freed of death certainly cheapened her evaluation of life. Perhaps her infatuation with carnage was downstream of that. 

So, maybe her blessing wasn’t a prize granted on account of her bloodlust. Was part of a deal? Had she given something up in exchange for it? A Faustian bargain with a poorly disguised devil? Athena could vaguely recall feeling weak and ill prior to her blessing - maybe she accepted some devil’s terms to outmaneuver death. She regularly had dreams of a man offering her something in one of the many cobblestone alleyways present in her home country. His face is always obscured, cloaked within the soft embrace of a moonless night, excluding his eyes. They were like her own as of late: narrow beams of pearly light radiating from a pair of shadow-cast sockets. 

Of course, that was all conjecture. Speculations based on an assortment of other speculations. Perhaps she felt weak and ill *because* of the blessing’s transformative power. Perhaps the man in her dreams was simply a figment of her imagination, reconciling the horror of her existence. There was no way to verify any of it, and if she dwelled on her nebulous history for too long, she’d inevitably arrive at her least favorable theory. 

Maybe she hadn’t been granted a blessing. 

Maybe she’d been cursed. 

- - - - -

By the time Athena was plodding up the cellar stairs, finally finished with the laborious task of burying the butcher, it was nearly sunup. She wasn’t thrilled with the prospect of going without her right hand for the whole damn day, so sleep was of paramount importance. Athena dumped her dirt-covered boots inside her bathtub, pulled open her medicine cabinet and procured a handful of Benadryl, downing the pink tabs in a single swallow. 

She *almost* forgot she wasn’t wearing her precious mask.

She *almost* saw her reflection in the mirror as the medicine cabinet swung closed. 

Thankfully, Athena twisted her body away from the glass at the last second, flipping around to face a wall covered in peeling, jaundiced wallpaper. Staring at the decaying cellulose was the first free moment she’d had since the butcher snuck in. 

In one swift motion, she thrust her handless stub through the wall.

Athena did not scream. She wanted to, but couldn’t. The catharsis wasn’t advisable. 

If her neighbors called the police, who knows what would happen.

She didn’t have the energy for more violence, nor did she have the will to skip town. Not again. 

Athena was much, much too exhausted. 

- - - - -

Her wounds hurt, but they wouldn’t bleed. It was the same with lost limbs. She’d forgone the need for the iron-bound liquid, apparently. One of the many strange facets of her ambiguous immortality, but it wasn’t the strangest. 

No, that honor was reserved for the way her body healed. 

It would go like this: 

Athena would sustain damage. In the short term, nothing would happen. Lacerations wouldn’t spontaneously close like a cluster of microscopic nanobots were tasked with keeping her whole. Limbs wouldn’t immediately start growing back like the buds of a rapidly maturing plant. The process was much less…biologic. Her invulnerability lacked a defined scientific rationale. Her blessing refused such constraints. She would fall asleep, and when she awoke, everything would be back in working order. Everything that had been severed, burnt, crushed, or otherwise damaged would be replaced. Those replacements weren’t a copy designed from her original body. They were different: pieces that seemed to have been borrowed from someone else, though it was never clear from whom.

When Athena lost a sheet of flank skin to an axe swipe, what she awoke with was an entirely different skin tone, but it covered the damaged area completely. 

When Athena forfeit a hand to the maw of a hydraulic press, the hand that returned nearly matched her natural complexion, but it appeared much younger. The nails were painted cherry-red, too. She liked that. From then on, she painted all of her nails that way.

And when Athena mangled her left foot after a nasty, four-story fall, the foot that replaced hers was hideous: gnarled and disease-ridden. Obsidian toenails above water-logged, gray-skinned toes. Almost looked like the ivory keys of a grand piano. She despised it. Athena didn’t consider herself vain, but at the same time, she found this particular replacement abhorrent and, ultimately, intolerable. 

So, one evening, she drove a machete through the garish limb, right above the ankle. Threw the pitiable thing in a nearby dumpster. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, playful curiosity swimming in her heart. 

*I wonder what’ll be there in the morning.*

She awoke at the break of dawn. Not gently. Not to the chiming of an alarm. 

Athena awoke in a state of absolute, undiluted agony. 

Whatever was now below her ankle seethed with pain. Wails erupted from her vocal cords. She ripped the blanket off her body. 

What she found was a cluster of blackened flesh writhing where that diseased limb had previously been attached. 

Glistening black tubes, tangled together like the intertwined tails of a rat king. There were mounds of raised mucosa scattered within the mass that resembled lips - pink, wet, and plump - never paired to form something as recognizable as a mouth. Between the tubes and the singular lips, deep within the eldritch bedlam, there looked to be dozens of lidless, colorless eyes, aggregated like grapes, staring at nothing or at everything - it was impossible to tell. 

The smell was horrific, but the sound was worse: a cacophony of moist sloshing with intermittent clicks and belches filled Athena’s ears. 

Although the experience was traumatic, she was still very lucky that day. When she ran out into the street, screaming like a maniac, ambulation crooked on account of her poor excuse for a foot, the horrified townsfolk who gunned her down had excellent aim. Hot metal eviscerated the ball of incomprehensible meat attached to her leg. Of course, they did a number on Athena as well. That’s when the final, most important quirk of her blessing became apparent.

A hail of bullets unilaterally ravaged her body - all but her skull and the skin that covered it, that is. 

For whatever reason, that bone and its casing had become truly invulnerable. 

Athena dragged herself into a nearby forest, bruised, ragged and bleeding. When she could move no longer, she fell asleep under a maple tree, a malformed husk of her former self. 

Dawn once again crested over the horizon. When she awoke, each and every injury had been healed. 

Each and every injury had been healed *separately*, that is. 

The bullet hole through the back of her neck had been repaired with a different piece of tissue when compared to the bullet hole through her sternum, her left kneecap, her collarbone - so on and so on. She was inexplicably healed, yes, but asides from her consciousness, Athena wasn’t herself anymore. Excluding her face and skull, she had become a patchwork golem - a quilt stitched together from scraps of nameless skin and sinew. 

In theory, that arrangement would have been perfectly fine. There was only one problem. 

Any and all flesh she owned was still subject to the demands of rot and decay, even if it couldn’t earnestly die while still attached to her and her blessing. Thus, her head had become withered and gaunt after a century of gradual denigration. Athena’s visage was one of living death, and if she wanted that to change, it seemed to her like she would need to be fully decapitated. 

But if she wanted to avoid her head becoming a wriggling globe of tubes and eyes,

She couldn’t do it herself.

The day after the butcher’s untimely demise, Athena stirred around noon. She felt her new hand before she saw it, wiggling her replaced fingers under the comforter to confirm the machinery was in working order. She slid over to the side of the bed. The faint scent of dried blood still lingered in the air, but it didn’t inspire deep satisfaction and a sense of vitality. Not like it used to. 

With a sigh, she headed to the kitchen. Didn’t even bother to inspect the hand on the way there. She could evaluate the appendage for diseases and defects with her fingers wrapped around a hot cup of coffee. 

The skin was bronze and smooth. Transplanted from a young Mediterranean woman, perhaps. The top third of a tattoo was visible on the underside of her wrist. It was dull red and curved. Maybe part of a rose petal? Or a heart? Hard to say. After about an inch, the pigment abruptly cut off, transitioning into an unrelated patch of pale white skin. The echoes of a different injury she couldn’t quite remember.

Athena considered digging through her junk drawer. Her favorite crimson nail polish was in the compartment somewhere. Maybe that’d make her feel better: an old ritual to remind her of happier times. It would match the tattoo, at least. 

*”What’s the point…”* she whispered, placing her mug onto the countertop and leaning her dessicated head against the wall. Painting her nails was akin to lobbing a handful of ice cubes over the rim of a volcano and expecting the temperature to change. 

She was an abomination. 

Athena pulled her head from the wall and spun around to face the kitchen table. Lying in the center was her dented mask. It was the last authentic piece of herself she had left. From what she could recall, she’d commissioned the mask from a local metalworker, back when her face was just aged and not frankly rotten. It was based on an old photograph of herself that she’d since lost. 

Her eyes drifted to the cellar door. 

Maybe it was finally time for Plan B. 

Suddenly, she felt something. A forgotten emotion fluttering around in her chest. 

Purpose? Meaning? Momentum? It was something that lay at the intersection of those feelings. She hung on to it for dear life and paced towards the door. 

*Why am I resisting? What am I even holding on to?*

*I’m not human. I’m not anyone. I’m not even Athena - not anymore.*

I’m an abomination. 

Might as well look like one. 

At the very back of the cellar, across the dirt-covered floor turned graveyard, there was a wooden device she had built a long time ago: a hanging blade, a lever, and a place to put her head. 

Athena’s makeshift guillotine. 

She didn’t slow down. She didn’t stop to consider her options. She knew that might steer her away from her current course of action. 

*So what if my head becomes a bouquet of eyes and lips and black flesh?*

*At least I’ll know what I am, and I won’t be stuck in between.*

*And I mean, who knows?*

*Maybe nothing will sprout from the wound.*

*Maybe everything will go black.*

*Maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll die.*

Athena wasn’t walking anymore. She was running. She scrambled to the ground, throwing her head into the hole with reckless abandon. 

*Maybe I’ll truly be free.*

She pulled the lever, and the blade fell. 

Her head landed on the floor with a sickening *thud*.

For a moment, the world did go black.

But that was only because she’d closed her eyes. 

When they opened, she was staring at a latticework of dust-covered wooden beams.

Because *of course* she hadn’t died.

Her blessing simply wouldn’t allow it. 

It was an impulsive mistake - one that she sorely regretted moments after pulling the lever, sure, but that was only a fraction of the total regret she’d feel a day and a half later. 

Eventually, she fell asleep. 

When Athena awoke, she couldn’t see the wriggling mass of tubes of eyes that was born of her mistake, blossoming from the bottom of her severed head. 

But she could feel the pain of it all.

She could smell its cadaverous scent. 

Worst of all, she could hear its endless squirming - the sloshing and the clicking and the bubbling of fetid gas. 

And there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it. 

Although she could not recall his words, her fate was exactly as The Red Priest had advertised. 

*”Oh, no, dear. You, as you are currently, won’t live on forever with my God’s help. There isn’t a blessing for something so…unnatural. The soul will not stagnate. It’s against its divine composition. It will always change. But your body? Your soul’s earthly prison? Now that’s a different story…”*

Athena bristled at the soft creaking of stubborn wood coming from the corner of her moonlit bedroom. She tried to temper her excitement. The groans and whines of her old home had tricked her many times before, and even if the soft creaking was a harbinger of his arrival, as opposed to meaningless white noise, that didn’t guarantee he’d perform the heinous and specific act she so badly wanted him to. 

*It could be nothing*, she thought. 

Silence returned. Before she could completely discard her excitement, Athena felt the icy whisper of night air. It squeezed itself under the edge of her mask and began licking at her cheek. 

Finally, after months of patience and hard work, someone had opened her window in the dead of night. 

*I suppose it could be an unrelated intruder*; she considered. 

Hope sunk its teeth deep, and she banished the consideration from her mind. 

*No - it must be him. I mean, what are the odds?*

Slow, deliberate footsteps marked his approach. Athena shifted, faking a quick snore and angling her face away from the intruder. She hoped her neck looked tantalizing in the moonlight: a nice tenderloin cut for the butcher creeping through her room. She had purposefully been sleeping under a large, heavy comforter in such a way that the only skin left showing was from her neck up. It was a silent suggestion. Subliminal coercion to get what she wanted without asking. 

The rules of her blessing forbade Athena from asking. Or, more accurately, the result would be less than ideal if she asked for it. She’d learned that lesson the hard way, and this modification was too important to fuck up by circumventing the rules. 

The footsteps stopped at the side of her bed. His breathing was labored and vigorous, almost coital in its intensity. 

This is it. This is the moment. 

*Faceless killer, grant me rebirth*, she beseeched. 

Then, he struck. 

His cleaver came crashing down into her abdomen. 

He paused, tilting his head slightly. Something didn’t feel right. He couldn’t smell liberated blood, the intoxicating scent of hot copper bursting from a fresh wound. Not only that, but the blow itself was dry and joyless. There was no squish. No pulp. 

No scream, either. 

Confusion quickly turned to rage. He ripped the blade out of her abdomen, arched it over his shoulder, and brought it down again, aiming for the center of her chest as outlined by the comforter. 

Still, nothing. 

For a moment, he wondered if there was anyone under the blanket at all, but the commotion had caused his would-be victim’s hand to peek out and drape over the bedframe. He wasted no time in severing the appendage, convinced that would finally produce the desired effect. 

Flesh and bone hit the wood floor with a dull *thump*. 

Silence followed. 

The butcher didn’t understand. 

Something was desperately, desperately wrong. 

He bent down and picked it up by the wrist. The tissue was warm, but disturbingly dry. He dragged his fingertips over the saw-toothed incision, feeling fragmented bone tent his skin. That’s when he noticed the size of the hand. It was large, with hairy knuckles and a calloused palm. His eyes drifted back to his target. The body under the blanket looked female: an hourglass figure with discernible breasts and rich, mahogany-colored hair. Surely, this was the woman he’d been conversing with for months now - another love-struck piglet tempting him to leave his wife. To his knowledge, he hadn’t ever killed an innocent before. 

Somehow, though, the hand didn’t appear to match. 

Meanwhile, Athena’s patience was beginning to wear thin. 

Third time’s a charm, he supposed, never one to overthink a situation. Another wild swing collided with Athena. He intended to bury the cleaver into her brain, but it bounced off her skull. 

That’s not possible, he thought. 

So he swung again. And again. And again. Each time, the blade was rejected. No amount of force would penetrate the patch of flesh above her ear. On his seventh attempt, he made a fatal error. 

The cleaver struck her forehead, creating a minor dent in her mask. 

Now this she would not abide. 

Athena sprung up like a bear trap, landing on all fours with the grace of a seasoned predator, blocking his only exit. He jumped back, watching in horror as she creaked upright, joints clicking and cracking like Roman candles. The whispers of night air emanating from the open window whistled a bevy of secrets through her white satin negligee, causing the ends to billow. 

He extended a trembling hand towards Athena, cleaver rattling against his wedding ring. The butcher couldn’t recall the last time his hand trembled. Maybe since his first kill, and that was a long, long time ago. 

*”All those months being subjected to your drivel - hundreds and hundreds of emails - and it’s all going to be for naught,”* Athena whispered. 

Determining his identity and luring him into her home was no small feat. 

*”You’ve done it before, no? Decapitated your victims pre-mortem?”*

He couldn’t find anything to say in response. 

Athena looked the butcher up and down. This killer had eluded the FBI for over a decade, but he was no Hellspawn. No infallible mastermind. He was just some *man* - stocky with dyed gray hair and an overbite. 

She slinked forward. 

He found himself unable to move. 

*”Where’s your voice, sweet child? What happened to your silver tongue? I’ve read your manifesto. You’re so tiringly verbose when you’re taunting the police, but now, in person, you have nothing to say?”*

Athena ran a shriveled tongue along her artificial dentition, counting the number of teeth, making sure they were all still there. Thanks to the blessing, her original, adult teeth had fallen out over a century ago, and they were one of the few body parts that wouldn’t be cosmically replaced while she slept. At the time, it was only a slight setback, and she quickly made do. 

Gums gleaming with sewing needles were intimidating, sure, but it was uncomfortable and challenging to maintain. The situation was razor blades with similar. Eventually, the solution became apparent to Athena, and although it was laughably obvious, it hadn’t jumped to the forefront of her mind because she looked so young back then. 

What do adults do when they lose their teeth? 

Well, they get dentures, of course. 

She reached behind her head and unfastened the ribbon that kept her precious mask on tight. The pale metal face of a beautiful woman fell from her own, taking the luscious, mahogany-colored hair with it. She grinned at the butcher, baring a mouthful of permanently borrowed teeth. Most were human, excluding her incisors: those had first belonged to a bull shark. 

Athena thought they were a good touch.

She allowed the butcher a few more seconds to respond. Dying words were a basic human right. Civility dictated she afford him said rights. Athena held onto a perverse sense of civility because it made her feel human. Moreover, it couldn’t be cut from her, therefore, it couldn’t be replaced by her blessing. 

He couldn’t comprehend the face that hid behind the mask, paralyzed as two bright white pinpoints bored into him from the depths of two empty sockets. The light seemed to extend into her skull for miles and was almost angelic in its purity. 

*Time’s up*, Athena thought. 

“Disappointing,” she murmured.

The predator unhinged her jaw and lunged at the butcher. 

- - - - - 

Before the blessing, Athena’s body had intended to die sometime during the nineteenth century, though nowadays she found the details surrounding her blessing hazy. Not only were they buried under the thick sediment of time, but those crucial details were outshone by the memories of her life directly *after* the blessing. It was the peak after all; she had never been happier. 

That said, she would frequently chastise her younger self for not having the presence of mind to write anything down. Gods, however small, need historians. How else could they keep track of something as vast as reality? 

*Why can’t I recall where this blessing came from?* She’d often wonder. 

From there, a bout of pointless speculation was inevitable.

Athena enjoyed killing - thoroughly and without regret. Had she won this blessing through some blood-soaked ritual combat? Appeased the right voodoo master with her love of the craft? Alternatively, her murderous proclivities could be a byproduct of her immortality, rather than the catalyst of it. She killed for all sorts of reasons back then, after all. For profit. For revenge. For love. For fun. Being freed of death certainly cheapened her evaluation of life. Perhaps her infatuation with carnage was downstream of that. 

So, maybe her blessing wasn’t a prize granted on account of her bloodlust. Was part of a deal? Had she given something up in exchange for it? A Faustian bargain with a poorly disguised devil? Athena could vaguely recall feeling weak and ill prior to her blessing - maybe she accepted some devil’s terms to outmaneuver death. She regularly had dreams of a man offering her something in one of the many cobblestone alleyways present in her home country. His face is always obscured, cloaked within the soft embrace of a moonless night, excluding his eyes. They were like her own as of late: narrow beams of pearly light radiating from a pair of shadow-cast sockets. 

Of course, that was all conjecture. Speculations based on an assortment of other speculations. Perhaps she felt weak and ill *because* of the blessing’s transformative power. Perhaps the man in her dreams was simply a figment of her imagination, reconciling the horror of her existence. There was no way to verify any of it, and if she dwelled on her nebulous history for too long, she’d inevitably arrive at her least favorable theory. 

Maybe she hadn’t been granted a blessing. 

Maybe she’d been cursed. 

- - - - -

By the time Athena was plodding up the cellar stairs, finally finished with the laborious task of burying the butcher, it was nearly sunup. She wasn’t thrilled with the prospect of going without her right hand for the whole damn day, so sleep was of paramount importance. Athena dumped her dirt-covered boots inside her bathtub, pulled open her medicine cabinet and procured a handful of Benadryl, downing the pink tabs in a single swallow. 

She *almost* forgot she wasn’t wearing her precious mask.

She *almost* saw her reflection in the mirror as the medicine cabinet swung closed. 

Thankfully, Athena twisted her body away from the glass at the last second, flipping around to face a wall covered in peeling, jaundiced wallpaper. Staring at the decaying cellulose was the first free moment she’d had since the butcher snuck in. 

In one swift motion, she thrust her handless stub through the wall.

Athena did not scream. She wanted to, but couldn’t. The catharsis wasn’t advisable. 

If her neighbors called the police, who knows what would happen.

She didn’t have the energy for more violence, nor did she have the will to skip town. Not again. 

Athena was much, much too exhausted. 

- - - - -

Her wounds hurt, but they wouldn’t bleed. It was the same with lost limbs. She’d forgone the need for the iron-bound liquid, apparently. One of the many strange facets of her ambiguous immortality, but it wasn’t the strangest. 

No, that honor was reserved for the way her body healed. 

It would go like this: 

Athena would sustain damage. In the short term, nothing would happen. Lacerations wouldn’t spontaneously close like a cluster of microscopic nanobots were tasked with keeping her whole. Limbs wouldn’t immediately start growing back like the buds of a rapidly maturing plant. The process was much less…biologic. Her invulnerability lacked a defined scientific rationale. Her blessing refused such constraints. She would fall asleep, and when she awoke, everything would be back in working order. Everything that had been severed, burnt, crushed, or otherwise damaged would be replaced. Those replacements weren’t a copy designed from her original body. They were different: pieces that seemed to have been borrowed from someone else, though it was never clear from whom.

When Athena lost a sheet of flank skin to an axe swipe, what she awoke with was an entirely different skin tone, but it covered the damaged area completely. 

When Athena forfeit a hand to the maw of a hydraulic press, the hand that returned nearly matched her natural complexion, but it appeared much younger. The nails were painted cherry-red, too. She liked that. From then on, she painted all of her nails that way.

And when Athena mangled her left foot after a nasty, four-story fall, the foot that replaced hers was hideous: gnarled and disease-ridden. Obsidian toenails above water-logged, gray-skinned toes. Almost looked like the ivory keys of a grand piano. She despised it. Athena didn’t consider herself vain, but at the same time, she found this particular replacement abhorrent and, ultimately, intolerable. 

So, one evening, she drove a machete through the garish limb, right above the ankle. Threw the pitiable thing in a nearby dumpster. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, playful curiosity swimming in her heart. 

*I wonder what’ll be there in the morning.*

She awoke at the break of dawn. Not gently. Not to the chiming of an alarm. 

Athena awoke in a state of absolute, undiluted agony. 

Whatever was now below her ankle seethed with pain. Wails erupted from her vocal cords. She ripped the blanket off her body. 

What she found was a cluster of blackened flesh writhing where that diseased limb had previously been attached. 

Glistening black tubes, tangled together like the intertwined tails of a rat king. There were mounds of raised mucosa scattered within the mass that resembled lips - pink, wet, and plump - never paired to form something as recognizable as a mouth. Between the tubes and the singular lips, deep within the eldritch bedlam, there looked to be dozens of lidless, colorless eyes, aggregated like grapes, staring at nothing or at everything - it was impossible to tell. 

The smell was horrific, but the sound was worse: a cacophony of moist sloshing with intermittent clicks and belches filled Athena’s ears. 

Although the experience was traumatic, she was still very lucky that day. When she ran out into the street, screaming like a maniac, ambulation crooked on account of her poor excuse for a foot, the horrified townsfolk who gunned her down had excellent aim. Hot metal eviscerated the ball of incomprehensible meat attached to her leg. Of course, they did a number on Athena as well. That’s when the final, most important quirk of her blessing became apparent.

A hail of bullets unilaterally ravaged her body - all but her skull and the skin that covered it, that is. 

For whatever reason, that bone and its casing had become truly invulnerable. 

Athena dragged herself into a nearby forest, bruised, ragged and bleeding. When she could move no longer, she fell asleep under a maple tree, a malformed husk of her former self. 

Dawn once again crested over the horizon. When she awoke, each and every injury had been healed. 

Each and every injury had been healed *separately*, that is. 

The bullet hole through the back of her neck had been repaired with a different piece of tissue when compared to the bullet hole through her sternum, her left kneecap, her collarbone - so on and so on. She was inexplicably healed, yes, but asides from her consciousness, Athena wasn’t herself anymore. Excluding her face and skull, she had become a patchwork golem - a quilt stitched together from scraps of nameless skin and sinew. 

In theory, that arrangement would have been perfectly fine. There was only one problem. 

Any and all flesh she owned was still subject to the demands of rot and decay, even if it couldn’t earnestly die while still attached to her and her blessing. Thus, her head had become withered and gaunt after a century of gradual denigration. Athena’s visage was one of living death, and if she wanted that to change, it seemed to her like she would need to be fully decapitated. 

But if she wanted to avoid her head becoming a wriggling globe of tubes and eyes,

She couldn’t do it herself. 

- - - - - 

The day after the butcher’s untimely demise, Athena stirred around noon. She felt her new hand before she saw it, wiggling her replaced fingers under the comforter to confirm the machinery was in working order. She slid over to the side of the bed. The faint scent of dried blood still lingered in the air, but it didn’t inspire deep satisfaction and a sense of vitality. Not like it used to. 

With a sigh, she headed to the kitchen. Didn’t even bother to inspect the hand on the way there. She could evaluate the appendage for diseases and defects with her fingers wrapped around a hot cup of coffee. 

The skin was bronze and smooth. Transplanted from a young Mediterranean woman, perhaps. The top third of a tattoo was visible on the underside of her wrist. It was dull red and curved. Maybe part of a rose petal? Or a heart? Hard to say. After about an inch, the pigment abruptly cut off, transitioning into an unrelated patch of pale white skin. The echoes of a different injury she couldn’t quite remember.

Athena considered digging through her junk drawer. Her favorite crimson nail polish was in the compartment somewhere. Maybe that’d make her feel better: an old ritual to remind her of happier times. It would match the tattoo, at least. 

*”What’s the point…”* she whispered, placing her mug onto the countertop and leaning her dessicated head against the wall. Painting her nails was akin to lobbing a handful of ice cubes over the rim of a volcano and expecting the temperature to change. 

She was an abomination. 

Athena pulled her head from the wall and spun around to face the kitchen table. Lying in the center was her dented mask. It was the last authentic piece of herself she had left. From what she could recall, she’d commissioned the mask from a local metalworker, back when her face was just aged and not frankly rotten. It was based on an old photograph of herself that she’d since lost. 

Her eyes drifted to the cellar door. 

Maybe it was finally time for Plan B. 

Suddenly, she felt something. A forgotten emotion fluttering around in her chest. 

Purpose? Meaning? Momentum? It was something that lay at the intersection of those feelings. She hung on to it for dear life and paced towards the door. 

*Why am I resisting? What am I even holding on to?*

*I’m not human. I’m not anyone. I’m not even Athena - not anymore.*

I’m an abomination. 

Might as well look like one. 

At the very back of the cellar, across the dirt-covered floor turned graveyard, there was a wooden device she had built a long time ago: a hanging blade, a lever, and a place to put her head. 

Athena’s makeshift guillotine. 

She didn’t slow down. She didn’t stop to consider her options. She knew that might steer her away from her current course of action. 

*So what if my head becomes a bouquet of eyes and lips and black flesh?*

*At least I’ll know what I am, and I won’t be stuck in between.*

*And I mean, who knows?*

*Maybe nothing will sprout from the wound.*

*Maybe everything will go black.*

*Maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll die.*

Athena wasn’t walking anymore. She was running. She scrambled to the ground, throwing her head into the hole with reckless abandon. 

*Maybe I’ll truly be free.*

She pulled the lever, and the blade fell. 

Her head landed on the floor with a sickening *thud*.

For a moment, the world did go black.

But that was only because she’d closed her eyes. 

When they opened, she was staring at a latticework of dust-covered wooden beams.

Because *of course* she hadn’t died.

Her blessing simply wouldn’t allow it. 

It was an impulsive mistake - one that she sorely regretted moments after pulling the lever, sure, but that was only a fraction of the total regret she’d feel a day and a half later. 

Eventually, she fell asleep. 

When Athena awoke, she couldn’t see the wriggling mass of tubes of eyes that was born of her mistake, blossoming from the bottom of her severed head. 

But she could feel the pain of it all.

She could smell its cadaverous scent. 

Worst of all, she could hear its endless squirming - the sloshing and the clicking and the bubbling of fetid gas. 

And there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it.

Most were human, excluding her incisors: those had first belonged to a bull shark. 

Athena thought they were a good touch.

She allowed the butcher a few more seconds to respond. Dying words were a basic human right. Civility dictated she afford him said rights. Athena held onto a perverse sense of civility because it made her feel human. Moreover, it couldn’t be cut from her, therefore, it couldn’t be replaced by her blessing. 

He couldn’t comprehend the face that hid behind the mask, paralyzed as two bright white pinpoints bored into him from the depths of two empty sockets. The light seemed to extend into her skull for miles and was almost angelic in its purity. 

*Time’s up*, Athena thought. 

“Disappointing,” she murmured.

The predator unhinged her jaw and lunged at the butcher. 

- - - - - 

Before the blessing, Athena’s body had intended to die sometime during the nineteenth century, though nowadays she found the details surrounding her blessing hazy. Not only were they buried under the thick sediment of time, but those crucial details were outshone by the memories of her life directly *after* the blessing. It was the peak after all; she had never been happier. 

That said, she would frequently chastise her younger self for not having the presence of mind to write anything down. Gods, however small, need historians. How else could they keep track of something as vast as reality? 

*Why can’t I recall where this blessing came from?* She’d often wonder. 

From there, a bout of pointless speculation was inevitable.

Athena enjoyed killing - thoroughly and without regret. Had she won this blessing through some blood-soaked ritual combat? Appeased the right voodoo master with her love of the craft? Alternatively, her murderous proclivities could be a byproduct of her immortality, rather than the catalyst of it. She killed for all sorts of reasons back then, after all. For profit. For revenge. For love. For fun. Being freed of death certainly cheapened her evaluation of life. Perhaps her infatuation with carnage was downstream of that. 

So, maybe her blessing wasn’t a prize granted on account of her bloodlust. Was part of a deal? Had she given something up in exchange for it? A Faustian bargain with a poorly disguised devil? Athena could vaguely recall feeling weak and ill prior to her blessing - maybe she accepted some devil’s terms to outmaneuver death. She regularly had dreams of a man offering her something in one of the many cobblestone alleyways present in her home country. His face is always obscured, cloaked within the soft embrace of a moonless night, excluding his eyes. They were like her own as of late: narrow beams of pearly light radiating from a pair of shadow-cast sockets. 

Of course, that was all conjecture. Speculations based on an assortment of other speculations. Perhaps she felt weak and ill *because* of the blessing’s transformative power. Perhaps the man in her dreams was simply a figment of her imagination, reconciling the horror of her existence. There was no way to verify any of it, and if she dwelled on her nebulous history for too long, she’d inevitably arrive at her least favorable theory. 

Maybe she hadn’t been granted a blessing. 

Maybe she’d been cursed. 

- - - - -

By the time Athena was plodding up the cellar stairs, finally finished with the laborious task of burying the butcher, it was nearly sunup. She wasn’t thrilled with the prospect of going without her right hand for the whole damn day, so sleep was of paramount importance. Athena dumped her dirt-covered boots inside her bathtub, pulled open her medicine cabinet and procured a handful of Benadryl, downing the pink tabs in a single swallow. 

She *almost* forgot she wasn’t wearing her precious mask.

She *almost* saw her reflection in the mirror as the medicine cabinet swung closed. 

Thankfully, Athena twisted her body away from the glass at the last second, flipping around to face a wall covered in peeling, jaundiced wallpaper. Staring at the decaying cellulose was the first free moment she’d had since the butcher snuck in. 

In one swift motion, she thrust her handless stub through the wall.

Athena did not scream. She wanted to, but couldn’t. The catharsis wasn’t advisable. 

If her neighbors called the police, who knows what would happen.

She didn’t have the energy for more violence, nor did she have the will to skip town. Not again. 

Athena was much, much too exhausted. 

- - - - -

Her wounds hurt, but they wouldn’t bleed. It was the same with lost limbs. She’d forgone the need for the iron-bound liquid, apparently. One of the many strange facets of her ambiguous immortality, but it wasn’t the strangest. 

No, that honor was reserved for the way her body healed. 

It would go like this: 

Athena would sustain damage. In the short term, nothing would happen. Lacerations wouldn’t spontaneously close like a cluster of microscopic nanobots were tasked with keeping her whole. Limbs wouldn’t immediately start growing back like the buds of a rapidly maturing plant. The process was much less…biologic. Her invulnerability lacked a defined scientific rationale. Her blessing refused such constraints. She would fall asleep, and when she awoke, everything would be back in working order. Everything that had been severed, burnt, crushed, or otherwise damaged would be replaced. Those replacements weren’t a copy designed from her original body. They were different: pieces that seemed to have been borrowed from someone else, though it was never clear from whom.

When Athena lost a sheet of flank skin to an axe swipe, what she awoke with was an entirely different skin tone, but it covered the damaged area completely. 

When Athena forfeit a hand to the maw of a hydraulic press, the hand that returned nearly matched her natural complexion, but it appeared much younger. The nails were painted cherry-red, too. She liked that. From then on, she painted all of her nails that way.

And when Athena mangled her left foot after a nasty, four-story fall, the foot that replaced hers was hideous: gnarled and disease-ridden. Obsidian toenails above water-logged, gray-skinned toes. Almost looked like the ivory keys of a grand piano. She despised it. Athena didn’t consider herself vain, but at the same time, she found this particular replacement abhorrent and, ultimately, intolerable. 

So, one evening, she drove a machete through the garish limb, right above the ankle. Threw the pitiable thing in a nearby dumpster. She fell asleep with a smile on her face, playful curiosity swimming in her heart. 

*I wonder what’ll be there in the morning.*

She awoke at the break of dawn. Not gently. Not to the chiming of an alarm. 

Athena awoke in a state of absolute, undiluted agony. 

Whatever was now below her ankle seethed with pain. Wails erupted from her vocal cords. She ripped the blanket off her body. 

What she found was a cluster of blackened flesh writhing where that diseased limb had previously been attached. 

Glistening black tubes, tangled together like the intertwined tails of a rat king. There were mounds of raised mucosa scattered within the mass that resembled lips - pink, wet, and plump - never paired to form something as recognizable as a mouth. Between the tubes and the singular lips, deep within the eldritch bedlam, there looked to be dozens of lidless, colorless eyes, aggregated like grapes, staring at nothing or at everything - it was impossible to tell. 

The smell was horrific, but the sound was worse: a cacophony of moist sloshing with intermittent clicks and belches filled Athena’s ears. 

Although the experience was traumatic, she was still very lucky that day. When she ran out into the street, screaming like a maniac, ambulation crooked on account of her poor excuse for a foot, the horrified townsfolk who gunned her down had excellent aim. Hot metal eviscerated the ball of incomprehensible meat attached to her leg. Of course, they did a number on Athena as well. That’s when the final, most important quirk of her blessing became apparent.

A hail of bullets unilaterally ravaged her body - all but her skull and the skin that covered it, that is. 

For whatever reason, that bone and its casing had become truly invulnerable. 

Athena dragged herself into a nearby forest, bruised, ragged and bleeding. When she could move no longer, she fell asleep under a maple tree, a malformed husk of her former self. 

Dawn once again crested over the horizon. When she awoke, each and every injury had been healed. 

Each and every injury had been healed *separately*, that is. 

The bullet hole through the back of her neck had been repaired with a different piece of tissue when compared to the bullet hole through her sternum, her left kneecap, her collarbone - so on and so on. She was inexplicably healed, yes, but asides from her consciousness, Athena wasn’t herself anymore. Excluding her face and skull, she had become a patchwork golem - a quilt stitched together from scraps of nameless skin and sinew. 

In theory, that arrangement would have been perfectly fine. There was only one problem. 

Any and all flesh she owned was still subject to the demands of rot and decay, even if it couldn’t earnestly die while still attached to her and her blessing. Thus, her head had become withered and gaunt after a century of gradual denigration. Athena’s visage was one of living death, and if she wanted that to change, it seemed to her like she would need to be fully decapitated. 

But if she wanted to avoid her head becoming a wriggling globe of tubes and eyes,

She couldn’t do it herself. 

- - - - - 

The day after the butcher’s untimely demise, Athena stirred around noon. She felt her new hand before she saw it, wiggling her replaced fingers under the comforter to confirm the machinery was in working order. She slid over to the side of the bed. The faint scent of dried blood still lingered in the air, but it didn’t inspire deep satisfaction and a sense of vitality. Not like it used to. 

With a sigh, she headed to the kitchen. Didn’t even bother to inspect the hand on the way there. She could evaluate the appendage for diseases and defects with her fingers wrapped around a hot cup of coffee. 

The skin was bronze and smooth. Transplanted from a young Mediterranean woman, perhaps. The top third of a tattoo was visible on the underside of her wrist. It was dull red and curved. Maybe part of a rose petal? Or a heart? Hard to say. After about an inch, the pigment abruptly cut off, transitioning into an unrelated patch of pale white skin. The echoes of a different injury she couldn’t quite remember.

Athena considered digging through her junk drawer. Her favorite crimson nail polish was in the compartment somewhere. Maybe that’d make her feel better: an old ritual to remind her of happier times. It would match the tattoo, at least. 

*”What’s the point…”* she whispered, placing her mug onto the countertop and leaning her dessicated head against the wall. Painting her nails was akin to lobbing a handful of ice cubes over the rim of a volcano and expecting the temperature to change. 

She was an abomination. 

Athena pulled her head from the wall and spun around to face the kitchen table. Lying in the center was her dented mask. It was the last authentic piece of herself she had left. From what she could recall, she’d commissioned the mask from a local metalworker, back when her face was just aged and not frankly rotten. It was based on an old photograph of herself that she’d since lost. 

Her eyes drifted to the cellar door. 

Maybe it was finally time for Plan B. 

Suddenly, she felt something. A forgotten emotion fluttering around in her chest. 

Purpose? Meaning? Momentum? It was something that lay at the intersection of those feelings. She hung on to it for dear life and paced towards the door. 

*Why am I resisting? What am I even holding on to?*

*I’m not human. I’m not anyone. I’m not even Athena - not anymore.*

I’m an abomination. 

Might as well look like one. 

At the very back of the cellar, across the dirt-covered floor turned graveyard, there was a wooden device she had built a long time ago: a hanging blade, a lever, and a place to put her head. 

Athena’s makeshift guillotine. 

She didn’t slow down. She didn’t stop to consider her options. She knew that might steer her away from her current course of action. 

*So what if my head becomes a bouquet of eyes and lips and black flesh?*

*At least I’ll know what I am, and I won’t be stuck in between.*

*And I mean, who knows?*

*Maybe nothing will sprout from the wound.*

*Maybe everything will go black.*

*Maybe, if I’m lucky, I’ll die.*

Athena wasn’t walking anymore. She was running. She scrambled to the ground, throwing her head into the hole with reckless abandon. 

*Maybe I’ll truly be free.*

She pulled the lever, and the blade fell. 

Her head landed on the floor with a sickening *thud*.

For a moment, the world did go black.

But that was only because she’d closed her eyes. 

When they opened, she was staring at a latticework of dust-covered wooden beams.

Because *of course* she hadn’t died.

Her blessing simply wouldn’t allow it. 

It was an impulsive mistake - one that she sorely regretted moments after pulling the lever, sure, but that was only a fraction of the total regret she’d feel a day and a half later. 

Eventually, she fell asleep. 

When Athena awoke, she couldn’t see the wriggling mass of tubes of eyes that was born of her mistake, blossoming from the bottom of her severed head. 

But she could feel the pain of it all.

She could smell its cadaverous scent. 

Worst of all, she could hear its endless squirming - the sloshing and the clicking and the bubbling of fetid gas. 

And there wasn’t a damn thing she could do about it. 

Although she could not recall his words, her fate was exactly as The Red Priest had advertised. 

*”Oh, no, dear. You, as you are currently, won’t live on forever with my God’s help. There isn’t a blessing for something so…unnatural. The soul will not stagnate. It’s against its divine composition. It will always change. But your body? Your soul’s earthly prison? Now that’s a different story…”*

This is a curious observation that I have not been able to explain to myself and was looking for some advice/guidance in understanding it/improve it.

I use my Switch both ways, as a regular percolation or as an immersion-percolation hybrid following Tetsu/CC recipes depending on the coffee.

Recently, following one of Lance's Switch videos, I tried to see what difference it makes to have an immersive bloom: 

66g water in first with switch closed, followed by 22g coffee; light roast natural Ethiopia bombe ground at 4.5 on ZP6

Wdt to make sure even wetting, bloom for a minute, drain

Keeping switch open, pour all around till 200g, give it a small swirl

Close switch, gentle centre pour to 352g, steep for 1min, open switch and give it a small swirl at the start of drawdown (the drawdown is pointedly slower)

This results in a total brew time of almost 6minutes, whereas if I do a regular bloom with switch open, and everything else the same, it draws down around 4:30.

I get the same results, if I do a regular V60 brew (switch open throughout) and it still draws down by 4:00-4:30.

All 3 brews are at the same grind size, same temperature, same coffee beans. (Same pouring pattern?)

For reference, I am using a Cafec T-90 filter.

I understand this is probably from fines clogging the filter but I thought that would be less likely the case for an immersion bloom. I am little confused.

Normally I wouldn't worry about it if the coffee turned out okay but I feel it tastes a little over extracted/hard to pick out flavour notes.

I just want to understand what is going on.

1modchx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BatteryHub/comments/1modchx/investigate_dewalt_flexvolt_dcb6092_battery_pack/,Investigate DEWALT FLEXVOLT DCB609-2 Battery Pack Review Is It Worth Buying?,"The DEWALT FLEXVOLT 20V/60V MAX* Batteries, 9.0-Ah, 2-Pack (DCB609-2) has been making waves among power tool enthusiasts, and I was curious to see whether it lived up to its reputation. Testing it out for various projects over the past few weeks, I was armed with curiosity and a healthy dose of skepticism. Based on my experience, this battery pack is genuinely impressive, though not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed when I got my hands on the battery pack was its substantial feel. With its solid plastic build, the DEWALT FLEXVOLT DCB609-2 emits durability vibes like few other power tool batteries I’ve used. Though slightly heavier than older generations, it doesn't feel unwieldy thanks to the compact rectangular form. The brushed finish resists fingerprints, and the design sits snugly in any compatible tool. Even after dropping it a couple of times (construction sites aren’t forgiving), the casing held up without scratches or dents, which is a definite plus. DEWALT seems to understand the wild lives their products endure, and this one’s no exception.

**Ease of Use**  
Compatibility is where this battery set really shines. It works seamlessly with 20V MAX, 60V MAX, and even the demanding 120V MAX tools. That dual-voltage adaptability in the FLEXVOLT line is a game-changer—seriously, who doesn’t want fewer battery types clogging up their shelves? The LED State of Charge Display is another feature worth mentioning. Every time I checked those tiny lights shimmering with information, it felt oddly gratifying. The last thing you want is to be mid-drill and realize your battery decided to clock out early.

[Check DEWALT DCB609-2 price on Amazon.](https://optimumbattery.com/p/b06wp6gj4m/)

**Performance on Various Tools**  
Slide these batteries into any DEWALT 20V MAX tools, and the claims of 6x runtime hold some serious weight. I tested this pack with a cordless drill and noticed a significant uptick in runtime compared to older, lower-capacity batteries. Switching to the 60V MAX leaf blower, I was impressed by the sheer endurance, clearing the entire yard on a single charge. On construction sites, the battery kept a 120V MAX reciprocating saw running without hiccups. Rare, right? That being said, I found their charging time to be a tad longer than standard non-FLEXVOLT batteries. Plugging the charger in and wandering off to make a cup of coffee doesn’t cut it; you'll want to plan charging sessions, particularly for heavy-duty projects.

**Strengths**  
- Dual-voltage capability, making it suitable for a variety of DEWALT tools.  
- Impressive runtime, especially for 20V MAX tools, delivering up to six times more stamina than smaller-capacity battery packs.  
- Sturdy build quality that doesn’t falter in challenging environments like workshops or outdoor sites.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
- Longer charging time compared to traditional batteries, which can delay fast-paced projects.  
- Slightly heavier than older models, which may tire out users during extended usage sessions.  

**Battery Life and Power Delivery**  
This is where FLEXVOLT earns its stars. The 9.0-Ah capacity means you can power through tough tasks for longer durations. For instance, while cutting hardwood planks for a shelving unit, I completed over fifty cuts without a performance dip. It genuinely does have the ""power of corded"" performance when placed in compatible tools. However, take note: the performance boost comes with a tradeoff in weight. It's minor for most tools but could become noticeable in instances where precise handling matters.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to similar brands like Makita, Milwaukee, or Bosch reveals some interesting contrasts. The FLEXVOLT’s dual-voltage feature is an innovation others haven’t quite matched yet. Makita’s batteries, for instance, are lighter but lack the versatility. Milwaukee offers commendable runtime but sidesteps compatibility across voltage platforms. All in all, DEWALT excels in providing compatibility and versatility across different tools, but you’ll have to contend with moderate weight factors and charge durations if you’re shifting between work zones.

**Affordable Quality**  
While I can’t give you a specific dollar amount, let’s just say the DEWALT FLEXVOLT DCB609-2 leans on the premium side. But for what it offers, it feels justified to call it affordable quality. Consider this: investing in a battery pack like this means powering multiple tools with unmatched runtime rather than juggling cheaper, single-use batteries. You'll get your money's worth over time, especially if you're a frequent builder, contractor, or backyard DIY hero.

Reference:

Me- f 31

D- m 44

T- m 31

N- m 35



I’d been working with these guys (3 of them) for years and always felt comfortable around them. We met up at least once a year at work events, and I was really looking forward to hanging out this time. My plan was to have a drink or two and just relax with coworkers. Thats it.

When I arrived, D met me outside in the top parking lot holding Sour Patch Kids (cant eat those anymore) to greet me. He was very handsy, but I brushed it off, thinking he was just excited. D and I had a *friendly* relationship and hooked up before, but I was super clear about boundaries, especially that night. I was on day two of my period, heavy, full of clots and I had told him we weren’t doing anything physical that night. ESPECIALLY around cowrokers. He seemed to understand.

We went inside the apartment where T was in the kitchen and N was making music on the counter. We all caught up and talked about work, joking about how the next day at work was going to suck, it was an early morning. I mentioned I’d brought some extra Adderall in case anyone needed a boost, and D quickly asked for two for the morning.

T went to make me a drink with Crown Royal and Coca-Cola, but D intercepted and said, “I drink Coke Zero, not Coke,” looking at me for confirmation. I agreed and laughed a bit, saying yeah, I preferred Coke Zero. D finished making the rest of the drink and handed me the mix in a red solo cup.

After about 30 minutes, we went out onto the terrace to watch a concert at the amphitheater below. I was sipping my drink slowly even though it was only maaaybe a quarter/ third full. It tasted strong, so I took my time.

Later, T wanted to head out to a bar and seemed rushed. On the walk back to the apartment, I realized I’d forgotten my wallet in my car. Before heading out, I finished my drink, and D insisted on walking with me.

When we got to the parking lot on the roof, I noticed the front of my car was damaged. Like the bumper torn off and hanging loose. Someone hit me pulling out of a parking spot next to mine. A cop was already there, and I gave my information, but D was almost insistent on minimizing my contact with the officer and taking over the situation. I remember feeling calmer than usual, even the officer commented on how relaxed I seemed. Looking back, I question whether my car getting hit was an accident.. 

T and N came out to the parking lot, with T getting annoyed at how long the situation was taking and talking about heading to the bar and ordering an Uber. They took the loose parts off my fender and put them in my backseat.

Because of the damage to my car, I couldn’t drive home that night obvi- I was about an hour away from home. That’s why I had to stay overnight at D’s apartment. I asked if I could crash in the guest room, being very clear I didn’t want to mix anything outside of work with our coworkers. D seemed super understanding, especially knowing I was on my period.

From there, things started to blur…

  
We got back inside the apartment, less than ten minutes passed before we all headed out for an Uber to the bar. I don’t remember what kind of car it was, but I sat behind T, with D next to me and N behind the driver. D kept being very handsy, and I started pulling away slightly, it began to feel like too much with coworkers around.

When we got to the bar, it was dark and cramped. I thought to myself, what a dump. The place was long and narrow, with the bar running along the left side and bathrooms down at the far end. We sat at the far end of the bar, me next to D side by side, with N and T around the corner next to D. We seemed to be the only ones on that side.

Before I could really settle in, T ordered tequila shots for everyone. I hesitated but figured I’d just drink water and order food. After the shot, I went to the bathroom to pee. When I came out, D was waiting outside the door, trying to convince me to go inside the men’s bathroom with him. I said no and tried to push him away gently, telling him I didn’t want to do anything with coworkers around. He grabbed my arm, but I yanked it back and went to sit at the bar.

I asked the bartender if they had Angry Orchard or Bold Rock, but they didn’t. He suggested an ale or cider, so I said sure and took a sip. That’s where my memory gets fuzzy—I don’t remember much after the first sip of the beer. I can’t recall what it was called or if it was in a bottle or a can.

The next thing I remember is being unable to move or pull away. D was using his hand to press my throat against him. I don’t remember if anything finished. Then suddenly I was grabbing my jeans and bra off the bathroom floor.

I questioned D about why I was wearing different clothes and why the bathroom was flooded. I asked why I wasn’t wearing panties. Where tf was my tampon and why wasn't I wearing one??? 

He told me we had spent hours in the shower because I had blood and dirt on me, but then changed it to I was sick, then to ""sober up"" as I asked over the next few days. I was still out of it, so I just nodded along. He said he’d taken my tampon out during sex and that I was into it and that it went on for a while. I was shocked- I didn’t remember any of that and felt a deep ick feeling but kept moving to leave.

I grabbed my things, put a tampon in to get home, and when I went to leave, I blinked and realized I was on my knees in front of him. I felt paralyzed and couldn’t move. He kept shoving himself into my throat forcefully. I could feel my eyes watering but was frozen. Finally, he stopped without and walked me out to my car.

I didn’t see the others leave or come back to the apartment. When I got to my car, I realized my license wasn’t in the things I’d grabbed, I’d left my wallet in the apartment. I had only managed to gather my jeans and bra from the bathroom floor quickly.

I went back to the apartment with D, and again, I felt paralyzed with him forcing himself on me. I don’t even know how it happened.

Then, I remember being on my knees in front of him again, and he was slapping me across the face hard. I was scared and wincing every time. He seemed so angry, and I felt guilty without knowing why. Hot flashes of pain came with each slap, and I held back tears.

After a pause, he asked me, “Are you scared of me?” I nodded yes, and he slapped me more.

Finally, I made it to my car, crying and overwhelmed with panic and confusion. I started the car and left. I stopped at the first gas station on the way home and bought a personal pizza and some coffee. I took my morning meds and tried to eat, but I immediately felt sick. I never actually ""woke up"" that day. It was more of a blink. Like, I came to and I was up and moving around. 999.99999% sure I was drugged as two drinks (if that), should not have blacked out my whole night nor prevent me from ""waking up"" like a normal person. 

  
I had a SANE done at the hospital, but it was 3 days later. I brought the clothes I came to in, as well as what I could grab from the bathroom floor. I had to go back due to my headaches to find out I was also ""gifted"" a Post Concussion Concussi (?) from that night. My brain was scrambled the days following that night. I filed a police report, and Im hoping something comes to fruition. 

  
The flashbacks suck: falling down a staircase, being in a dark basements, seeing actions done to me in a shower.



The good ol' kicker- the company has under 50 employees. One of the guys is the nephew of the owner. I filed a report with HR, but kept their names anon until the investigation is further along. Im terrified of tipping any of them off- I have a strong nauseating feeling there is some sort of captured content from that night on a phone...
