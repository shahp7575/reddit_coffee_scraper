But so a few questions, I see some woman still can enjoy coffee , sugar free lattes, diet sodas , things like that, so my first question is , if I wanted a sugar free latte would I need to drink that with a meal? Or could I get it in between meals? Cause I’d assume it could interfere with my reading at 2 hour mark of a meal wouldn’t it?  If If I did get it with a meal and just sipped on it could that interfere with my results ? Like say I’m still sipping it close to 2 hour mark? Also, when I cook dinner I’m big on test tasting to make sure it’s cooking to the right flavor, can I still do that ?? I’m kinda gettin the hang of understanding the carbs and pairing it with protein and a fat. But the other random things are throwing me off lol. I’ve been able to make meals filling to me ! Snacks are eh on filling me. But I Deff am already getting tired of water, it’s all I’ve drank since being diagnosed the other day. I’ve also started drinking sugar free propels which now feel like a reward but I Deff would love to try other drink I just don’t know how to incorporate them into a day with testing and meals it’s confusing.  
Also for a snack say I have something small like my go to has been some gluten free veggie crackers  and a few slices of sharp cheddar block cheese, still feel kinda hungry after especially days I’m busy, am I okay to make like a slice of toast with peanut butter to help the hunger feeling?? I’m trying to learn lol thank who ever in advance ❤️ my numbers have been good after meals and when I check after snacks if I’m curious! But the fasting not so much ☹️",1,1750975639.0,GestationalDiabetes,0,1.0,False

1lld3ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1lld3ep/stay_away_from_the_red_lake_tavern/,Stay Away From The Red Lake Tavern,"The great State of Wisconsin is known for many things. Cheese, bumpy roads, breathtaking sights… Well, you can scratch that last one if you are in the 80% of land covered with nothing but corn and wheat fields. But, there is one thing that the Dairy State has flown under the radar for. Wisconsinites love to drink. In fact, we have the highest rate of binge drinking out of the entire United States. With that, you wouldn't be surprised to know that there are bars everywhere. You could throw a stone in any of our “historic” downtown streets and there is a high chance you will hit a bar, inn, tavern, etc. It is why so many small establishments often go overlooked. 

After I finished work tonight, I decided to take the back roads home instead of I-94 (my usual commute). There's no feeling quite like driving down a dead, dark, almost dreamlike road in the middle of nowhere. My dim headlights were barely able to reveal any of the abandoned houses and barns that I passed. But I found a light in the darkness, a bright little establishment tucked away in a miniscule settlement. The building looks unkempt but not quite abandoned. The walls were painted white at some point, but exposure to the elements have cracked it into a spiderweb-esque pattern. Even the wooden supports of the front porch have cracked under the test of time. And yet, a warm yellow light pours from the sporadically cracked windows. Perhaps strangest of all, the place is packed! Cars litter the parking lot which is no more than a gravel clearing. I should mention that it seems these country goers have no idea how to park. No rhyme or reason to their spots! Despite it being a Tuesday night, I decided to stop for at least a shot or two. Walking past a door to the main floor, I see a large, almost brand new looking sign on the side of the establishment. A clean white canvas with red fancy lettering. The Red Lake Tavern.

I was pretty shocked upon entering the bar, which was quaintly running out of the basement. It’s very clean and very full! The decor and activities were about what I expected. Neon beer signs, slot machines, pull tabs, the whole nine yards. Despite the basic look, the energy was akin to a bustling saloon. People conversing at tables, sipping on their craft beers, playing pool, going head to head in some drinking games, and even smoking cigarettes. I'm one of those weirdos that doesn't mind the cigarette smell, but this place didn't reek of burnt tobacco. It smelled cold and dusty, like that one relative's unused basement you played in as a kid. The bartender (I didn't catch her name) was very personable and easy to talk to. I asked her why I've never heard of the place, to which she said what I told you at the beginning of this post. She mentioned that she and her husband own the place and even live in the unit upstairs.

I'm not one to write reviews like this, especially since most of these dive bars don't stand out, but this place is special. The liquor is dirt cheap, the atmosphere is immaculate, even the bathrooms are squeaky clean (despite not having plumbing it seems)! I mention that because I may or may not be writing this on the pooper. I see it as necessary though! I want more people to check this place out! If you are near >!**I'M STARVING**!< and don't have allergies, I highly recommend checking out The Red Lake Tavern.

5/5 Stars: Highly recommended! 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Apparently, I wrote that one a little over a month ago.

I do not remember writing this. Hell, I don't even remember ever visiting that bar before tonight.

That review is my favorite out of the 25 documents I've found in my Google Drive so far. I must've been in a good mood that day. There is some variation in the posts. Most are pretty short and basic but sometimes I just ramble about the place for pages upon pages. Sometimes someone comes up and talks to me, sometimes I end up playing cards, and sometimes I just sit silently with the bartender. My last review from a couple days ago even details getting a splinter from a wooden table. I still have it. But in every post, I mention how nice the lady tending the bar is, I always get a drink, and I always end up writing a post recommending The Red Lake Tavern while taking a dump. As you do, I guess.

Thank the Lord none of these got posted. I'm guessing my phone plan doesn't cover the middle of nowhere as these were all written in Drive’s offline mode.

But something different happened tonight that allowed me to uncover all of this.

It was really busy at work, as most Fridays tend to be. My social battery was sufficiently depleted and I wanted a change of scenery. When I first started working here, a customer told me that there was a back road that basically leads from my work to my hometown. I had nothing to lose, so I turned right out of work instead of left.

The road was desolate. It gets dark as early as 5 PM this time of year, so my headlights were the only illumination I had. Large empty fields on both sides of the road were only broken by the occasional abandoned plot of land. Road conditions were slick so I was driving pretty slow. I thought that was why I noticed it. A bar that I had never seen before. It looked a little run down, but it was busy enough that I felt confident to stop in. There were tons of cars next to the establishment, all of them were randomly strewn across the gravel. I remember thinking ‘parking isn't that hard, people’ as I slammed my car door shut and gazed upon the building that loomed over me. It looked like a single story house with a front porch and all. The only indication of business was a large sign over the basement entrance that read “The Red Lake Tavern” in basic black font. The front door creaked loudly upon entry, but the overwhelming sound of dozens of drunk patrons gambling, conversing, and singing made it seem like nothing more than pin drop. 

It was about what I expected out of a midwestern bar. The place was packed, but it had the classic accoutrement. Neon signs, sexy posters, rigged gambling machines, the whole nine yards.

The place was musty but clean. Shockingly so. The floor looked freshly polished and mopped. At the time, I regretted not taking my allergy medication in the morning because I could already feel the incessant itch begin in the back of my throat. Weird since I didn't see any dust. I made my way to the only free spot at the bar, which was immediately attended to by the lone bartender. She was no older than 30, blonde, personable, and absolutely gorgeous. She almost glowed in comparison to everyone else in the bar. I'm really not one to flirt, but I thought I could at least get some small talk in before my drink. 

She told me that shots were only a dollar on Fridays, so I took 2 bills out and told her to grab one for each of us. I thought I just overreached because she gave me a toothy grin that was not-too-obviously hiding a scowl. 

She came back with 2 shots and a glass of ice. Pouring both shots into the cup she says, “I've had plenty.” She didn't even take the money.

I really wanted to ask about the place. Having worked in customer service I thought I would have at least heard about it, especially in such close proximity to work. it didn't help that I couldn't recognize anyone. None of my customers, colleagues, or friends were there to help me if anything went wrong. It’s pretty uncommon to enter a bar and not recognize anyone, especially in these little Midwest towns where everybody knows everybody. I started feeling worried.

Thankfully I was graciously bestowed a beverage to cool the nerves… And I was so grateful. I swirl the drink around the ice as I can feel my allergies flaring up again. I hoped taking a drink would have soothed the itch. Holding the glass up to my lips, tragedy strikes. I sneezed directly into my drink. Liquid covers my face and spills onto my work shirt. 

I sit and stew in embarrassment for a minute. Then I breathe out a quiet, “Man… Thankfully I don't work tomorrow!” I thought I made a sly recovery as I looked at the pretty bartender. The look on her face was a shocked horror as she looked at the spill up and down. 

She quickly ran out from behind the bar, only a notch below a run. “Oh god! Oh shit- let me get that cleaned up for ya!” She says rushing me down with a towel. Before I could even take the rag from her hand and say thank you, she began to frantically wipe down my face. 

“Oka- wait sto- wh-” I could barely get my words out, spitting the hairs of the cloth from my mouth. “Alri- Okay thank y- THANK YOU!” I yell at her as I rip the towel from her hands. I just glared at her hoping she would understand the overstep she just took. 

She pauses and takes another look at my shirt before racing behind the bar. She shuffles a bit before, “Here! Here! Here!” She yells in a panic, running around the bar again with a new shirt. “Take that one off and put this on instead! We can wash that one here!” 

“I’ll be alright.” I say with obvious annoyance in my voice. I began to check my belongings to make a swift exit, but something stopped me in my tracks. It took me a second to notice. The silence. It was deafening. My ears ring in the stagnant bar. That is when I turned around and saw  the bar patrons. All stood where they were, all slowly standing up, and all looking directly into my eyes as if I had made a mistake.

Before I could react, the bartender was on me. Grabbing at my clothes trying to get them off, she screams, “TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF! JUST GIVE ME THE FUCKING SHIRT. PLEASE JUST LET ME-” She was relentless trying to pry the shirt from my skin. I truly believed she was gonna just rip it off. 

I'm not proud of my action, but I was sufficiently scared so I punched her in the face. The bartender reeled back, checking her nose for blood before looking up. I could barely make out a soft, “Shit,” force its way up out of her mouth. 

I was frozen. Terror and guilt locked me into place. When faced with danger, humans have a natural response of fight or flight. Not many mention that freezing is just as natural.

It was then that I was broken free from my panic. The sound I heard above me was truly something I cannot describe. No amount of detail will ever be able to explain it in its actuality, but I can try. 

I thought someone was moving furniture for a second. It was a loud rumble moving from the other side of the bar towards me. There was an incredible weight above us and it was moving. As it grew louder in its approach, I could hear a slight fleshy squelching under the rumble. It was like someone was dragging a burlap sack full of cinder blocks and viscera across the floor above me. Even that doesn't do it justice. Before I knew it I was in a dead sprint out of the bar. I wish I could have gotten some answers, but it just wasn't worth my life. For some reason, I am convinced that if I would have stayed any longer, I never would have left.

Before I crashed my way into the driver's seat of my car, I took one last look up at the bar. The main floor’s lights were on now. I couldn't see anything inside of any of them. In fact, I couldn't even see light coming from one of them. I squinted to see if I could satiate the curiosity that burned inside me. I couldn't see anything until a massive shadow moved out of the way from the window. Like a boulder rolling to the side to reveal the entrance of a cavern. I wish I could have sped out of there, but the snow slowed my escape. Nothing came after me, nobody ran out of the bar, and I just drove off. 

I turned my music up as loud as I could. It's cowardly, but I just wanted to pretend that nothing happened. Distracting myself and putting all of my focus on the lyrics. It was only when I turned off of the back road that I noticed a stench. It was sour and hot. Somewhere between the smell of vomit and sulfur. The only excuse I had was that something died nearby, but the smell didn't leave. My car was so dark I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. It wasn't until I made it home to my bathroom that I discovered the source. My shirt looked like someone spilled crude oil on it. The stain was so dark and I could see smudges all over my face. They were dark green and barely washed off. It smelled so bad. You know the feeling you get when you are about to throw up? The cold sweat as if all of your blood fell down to your feet? That was a good reminder for me.

I would've showered all night if I didn't run out of hot water.

I put the shirt in a plastic bag and tied it up. The smell was so bad I'm just gonna throw it away. I was gonna keep it and show it to the cops, but I don't think that's an option anymore. I dialed the non-emergency line for the town closest to the bar hoping to get someone over there. 

“ >!**PLEASE HELP HER**!< County Police Department” a gruff sounding man answered the phone.

“Hey, sorry to bother so late, but I was attacked by some staff at a bar. It's outside of town so I'm not sure about jurisdiction or whatnot, but this feels bad enough to report.” 

He was quiet for a moment. “That shouldn't be a problem. Where are you now?” 

“Home. This happened a little over 3 hours ago.”

“Ooookay?” He replied in a confused tone. I guess it is weird that I didn't call right away. “Do you have an address for the place?”

“No, just a name. Red Lake Tavern. It's on County Road J.” 

“Hm… One second please.” I could hear him set the phone down and begin typing on his keyboard. He paused… Typed again… paused… clicked his mouse a couple times. Then responded with exactly what I didn't want to hear, “I'm not seeing a Red Lake Tavern… I'm not seeing… Any businesses on this road in fact. Are you sure you have the right ro-”

I hung up. What was I going to say after that? I was going to start writing a testimony at least. Maybe I can report it in person after I get some pictures of the place.

That's when I found the rave reviews already sitting as unnamed documents in my Drive. One thing after another signaling me that I'm on my own. If I show this to anyone I know, I'll be put in a ward or rehab. 

So I'm here now. I was going to just post this as a warning, but I can't leave it like this. I have so many questions I just cannot leave unanswered. That's why I'm going back tomorrow. It's stupid, I am well aware, but I'm not going to be stupid. I'll go during the day, I'll bring protection, and I'll report back. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It's the next day. I would like to start this by saying that I am safe. I'm writing this in a hospital bed, but I am safe. 

Where do I even start?

I went back, obviously. After work, on a rare morning shift, I stopped at a pawn shop and picked up a small old fashioned snub nose revolver. It was really cheap and so was the ammo. I know now it's because it might as well be a nerf gun. He said “long rifle” ammo so I just assumed it would be good. I'm not really a gun guy. I told him that I really didn't intend to use it so I didn't care. The fear of God is more powerful than any caliber, but God wasn’t here today.

The sky was clear and the sun warmed the snow. Roads were in perfect speeding conditions for an easy drive. It's kind of jarring how beautiful the scenery was. The sun's rays shone down like a spotlight upon the run down bar… But it was so different. The building looked the same, but that was about it. There were no lights on and there was no sign. It was just a house. There were tons of cars still randomly placed around the gravel clearing beside it. Rusted and inoperable. There was absolutely no indication that anyone had even touched the place in years besides the open door to the basement that held the bar… or what was the bar. 

I started to panic. I've never truly questioned my own sanity up until now. The only thing that kept me from losing it was the thought ‘if I'm having a mental breakdown, I shouldn't have this’ as I loaded 8 tiny cartridges into the cylinder. The idea that I was cognizant enough to recognize the danger of having a firearm was more than able to snap me back to reality. I knew there was a bar there, and I knew I had been there on multiple occasions even if I didn't remember

Even still, if the door wasn't open I probably would have left. I probably should have. Honestly, I was beginning to question what I was even looking to accomplish. I left the first time thinking ‘answers aren't worth my life’. Then I remembered that it wasn't the first time. Months of time robbed from me. This was personal and no one was going to help me. 

The open door was an invitation onto the bar floor and I humbly accepted. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't too surprised to see an abandoned tavern. Mud caked the floor, tables were covered in dust, and a large family of spiders decided to call this sore sight a home. Broken glass poured from the screens of the slot machines that were now pushed over and looted. There were no chairs upright except for one. A single stool standing lonely in front of the bar. 

The bar itself was about as I remember. Well kept, well dusted, and well stocked. Stepping behind the bar, I could tell someone had been here recently. There were bottles open and rags left everywhere. I made the mistake of looking inside the bottle and, to my horror, it was filled with that dark bile. All other bottles contained it, too. 

For my sake, I decided to not think of the implication those bottles entailed and made my way to the back rooms. It was just a hallway with a couple of doors. There was a closet filled with old clothes, a disgusting bathroom (I was certainly correct about the lack of plumbing), and one final door that opened up to a staircase. I've been moving quietly before, but now I was silent. I could tell the stairs were creaky, but my light steps were enough to not cause any sound. Thank god I was quiet. 

It felt like it took hours to hike up 13 whole stairs. Details will be more detailed from here on as this moment will forever be seared into my mind. The first thing I noticed at the top was the smell. It smelled like shit. Like the actual feces of someone with severe lactose intolerance living in this State. Then I heard a sound that I hate to even describe. It sounded like a giant mouth slowly swishing around a thick liquid. Emphasis on giant as it sounded huge. As I listened, I worried that my gun might not be as helpful as I thought, but I readied it all the same. 

I waited for the squishing to stop before I slowly began to open the door. The smell intensified to the point that it burned my nostrils. The door didn't make a sound as it moved out of the way, creating a panoramic effect. From right to left. 

At first I saw what looked like a stable with no hay. Troughs lined the walls that were crudely fastened to the walls with tape and nails. They were stained in deep shades of dried brown and maroon. A dark green trail has been left in front of the troughs. I braced as I swung the door open a little more. Then I saw the bartender. She was wearing the same clothes as last night, now stained with the same liquid that now stained my work shirt. It was the same woman now horribly thin and sickly. I felt so sad watching her struggle to carry a heavy bucket up to one of the troughs. My sorrow quickly turned to disgust as I examined what plopped out of the bucket. It looked like wet coffee grounds mixed with liquid excrement. The sound was so unforgettable at the time, yet I have forgotten. What I saw as the door was fully ajar made the audible slap of shit into a trough sound like a summer’s breeze.

I apologize in advance.

I thought it was a horrendously obese naked man at first, but it was far too big. It looked like a large fatty tumor with random patches of hair. Its light flesh colored skin was covered in large red pustules that oozed a dark green liquid. Its loose skin draped over the ground like a curtain and dragged behind. It was huddled over a trough. Its arms were long and remarkably thin with large fleshy oven mitts for hands. It scooped up piles of bloody diarrhea and shoveled it down its “mouth” like it was loading a musket. It looked more akin to a prolapsed anus than a mouth. It pushed in and out with every scoop. I couldn’t see any eyes, ears, or a nose. Just a hole at the front of the mass. I stood frozen as it began to stretch upward. Like the hole was the front of an elephant's trunk, it slowly moved up towards the ceiling. The skin lifted with it, revealing the stain it has left on the ground. Under everything, I saw a pair of human feet jutting out of a large fold, crushed and deformed under the weight. It began moving up and down, making that horrible swishing sound again. Its skin draping over the ground, lifting up, draping down, again, and again, and again. 

I don't know how long I stood there. In reality it was probably only a few seconds, but it felt like days before I threw up. Blood and bile dribbled on my shirt, my stifled gagging alerting the bartender. The girl looked horrified, as if a stranger had just entered her home carrying a gun. Her scream was so weak that it was closer to a deep grumble, but it managed to get the attention of the mass. Its hole swung around to meet my gaze. No eyes to see or be seen, but it looked at me and… blinked. Before I could turn around and run, the room was filled with people, grabbing at me and holding me in place. They were screaming louder than the very pits of hell. A symphony crying out in agony, despair, and rage. All at once. I went to cover my ears, but one of the faceless faces forced my arm down which threw the gun towards the bartender. As I struggled against the crowd I noticed her scramble for the gun, completely unphased by the people surrounding us. The mass kept blinking at me as more vomit climbed out from the depths of my insides. I was completely frozen.

The sickly woman attempted to get the gun, but she was so weak. She eventually fell to the ground next to the pistol and grabbed it. I still couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she struggled to aim the pistol at me. She was lying on her side and staring at me with eyes that screamed, “I didn’t want any of this.”

I didn't even hear the gun go off. The gun barely kicked out of her weak grip. To be honest it didn't hurt at all… Then I opened my eyes.

Everyone was gone. The bartender had switched her sights onto the creature. A small hole now punched through its trunk. Green slime, blood, and residual diarrhea poured out from the wound, but it didn't react. It swung its mouth to look at her... then back at me… then back at her which is where it stayed. I scooped the disgustingly light woman into my arms and booked it. 

I wasted no time sprinting down the stairs I came from. Down the stairs, to the end of the hallway, past the bar, and out the door. Olympic speed. I felt no desire to look back and I don't think she did either

Carefully, I layed her into the back of my car, hopped into the driver's seat, and sped off towards a hospital. On the way I could hear sobs and whimpers coming from behind me.

“I’m… So sorry… I’m sorry… You didn’t deserve this… None of you did…” She choked out in between tears and labored breaths. I sat quietly for a moment. None of you? Before I could ask anything further she started coughing up bile and blood, but far more than I did moments before. She was in very bad shape.

I reached back to take her hand and simply said, “Neither did you.” That was exactly what she wanted to hear. She held onto me for the rest of the drive. 

So, here I am now. Hospital Staff took her out in a stretcher and took me to a bed where they started asking the usual questions about my health. I told them to wait until the police arrived to ask questions. I will not be getting committed today.

The police didn’t even ask for a statement. I just told them everything. Amazingly they didn't look at me like an asylum escapee, but with shock. Like I just whispered their deepest darkest secret in their ears. They all left except for one who went to go find the bartender. I still don’t know what happened to her or if she's okay, but the feeling I got from holding her hand makes me think that is the last hand she will ever hold. 

I just got out of a CT scan. The doctors were just as shocked as the cops. They told me that the walls of my stomach and intestines were dangerously thin. As if something had been corroding them from the inside. Apparently I'm also pretty malnourished and dehydrated, but I've always been pretty scrawny so I didn't even notice. I'm guessing I'll be here for a while even though I feel completely fine. 

The cops aren't back yet, but I'm more focused on getting this out. If they tell me anything I'll update here. I just want people to see this and seriously heed my warning.

Don't go to random bars alone. If you do, let someone know where you are; and if something seems off, it very well could be. 

And if you see a bar called The Red Lake Tavern on the side of a county road, just keep driving. ",1,1750975496.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,1.0,True

----------------------

[Field Marshal Mashako Tshisekedi](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1l6wug3/conflict_democracy_at_dawn/) just had that kind of a feeling, a gnawing that couldn't be satiated...nerves. He was the highest level commander of the most powerful army on Earth, yet it was a single document that continued to eat away at his patience. 

""The outside context."" The Field Marshal shook his head and muttered to himself. He had read the document nearly thrice a day since it was first released over a decade ago and in that time even more had been added. Japan's actions hadn't made sense in a long time and it was putting everyone on edge. And here he sat once again, booting up his secure desktop system.

**ACCESS DENIED**

The screen blared red, flashing and sending alarm bells that where silenced by the press of an ""Ok, Accept"" prompt. He scratched his head in confusion and tried to open the file again.

**ACCESS DENIED**

""Terwase!"" He blared as a [fresh Lt. Col came running](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1etgdpy/roleplay_kobayashi_maru/). ""Did the IC [Intelligence Commission] send out a memo about system maintenance?""

It was an innocent question, yet the panic Tshisekedi was feeling internally kept growing. 

""No, sir. Not as far as our office is aware."" Mayamiko Terwase looked at his commanding officer with equal parts confusion and tiredness. Watching the Field Marshal shake his head, he was prepared for another scolding but was shocked when the opposite happened and the Marshal sat in silence.

""Make sure my Army is in order by the time I return."" The Field Marshal grabbed his jacket and sidearm. ""And call Suleiman, tell him we're KM0. He'll know what that means."" 

-----------------------

[Solange Issoze](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dx9ydj/diplomacy_uasr_a_promise_of_defiance/) was old and had wanted to retire years ago, instead he found himself deep in Mahakamji sitting across from the head of the Army, and beside the [President of Kaabu, Ahwoi.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1daus1i/roleplay_impermanence/) 

""Neither of you could access it?"" The Field Marshal spoke in hushed words, the dim lights of the African Soul Diner on Lower Kagame street adding a sense of dramatics. 

""No, which is odd."" The Premier shook his head, I did as you asked and have yet to reach out to the IC about this. ""But surely, it's just a technical error?""

[""What about Masozi? And Ebere? No records of them either.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dj97f5/secret_unidentified_gravitational_phenomena/) Ahwoi spoke next, given Kaabu's relation to the blacksite project. 

""According to the records I could access, Masozi was arrested on treason charges over a year ago, when Ebere disappeared and we lost contact."" Solange muttered even quieter as a waitress walked by. ""Something is going on, which makes you right, Mashako.""

""Thank you."" The Field Marshal grinned, ten years of nagging finally paying off. 

""So what do we do?"" Ahwoi was sounding panicked, the mounting crisis well above his paygrade.

""We assume the Presidium is compromised. Fall back onto old contacts, begin searching for clues."" Said Solange. ""Most importantly, we act as if nothing is wrong.""

----------------

[Dakarai Kelechi](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/1dj97f5/secret_unidentified_gravitational_phenomena/) raised his arm as if he was covering a cough, in reality, another traffic cam had pointed in his direction. His contacts in the IC had gone dark weeks ago, Masozi was arrested out of the blue, and he was left on the run. 

""Sir! Sir!"" A voice, familiar, called out through the crowd. Kelechi tried to get away but he felt the hand on his shoulder and he had no choice but to turn around.

""Agent Kelechi!"" It was one of his former pupils at the Commission. ""I'm so glad I ran into you, we should grab coffee!""

Kelechi saw it again, it was a feint glow behind the young girl's eyes. ""I don't think I have time.""

""Awww, it doesn't need to be for long!"" She was happy, as if the world wasn't collapsing around them. ""Come with me!""

She practically dragged him into an alley, as she promised the best local coffee in Kaabu was just around the corner. He didn't wait for her to turn around, drawing his pistol he shot her through the back. Turning just as two others began unholstering their own pistols. Two swift shots was all it took and three bodies now laid silently in the alley. 

He knew more would be coming and so raised his hood once more. Walking out of the alley, he looked up to the traffic cam, before once more disappearing into the crowd.",1,1750975081.0,worldpowers,0,1.0,False

**Our mission is to provide high-quality, scientifically-informed products that empower our customers to enhance their health and well-being. With a focus on transparency and accessibility, we strive to support a healthier, happier society.**

The supplement industry is flooded with overpriced products, fleeting trends, and questionable formulas. Too often, brands prioritize hype over health, pushing supplements that lack real benefits. Ultimate Outcomes was founded in 2023 with a different vision, one rooted in simplicity, transparency, and effectiveness.

As a college student with limited money, Brian saw that while many brands claimed to offer “clean” supplements, they often came at an inflated cost or were driven by trends rather than true wellness. He knew there had to be a better way.

At Ultimate Outcomes, we believe less is more. Every product we create has a clear purpose, using high-quality ingredients designed for measurable results—no fillers, no gimmicks, just what your body actually needs. Because when it comes to health, real outcomes matter.

Our first product, CoreFocus, was born out of a need for something better than just caffeine. As a college student, Brian relied on coffee and energy drinks to stay alert, but he realized that while caffeine provides a boost, it doesn’t truly enhance focus. He set out to create a smarter solution.

CoreFocus combines caffeine with powerful nootropics like Alpha-GPC, L-Tyrosine, and L-Theanine, ingredients that work together to sharpen concentration, sustain mental clarity, and keep you locked in during intense study sessions or long hours of work.

At Ultimate Outcomes, we stand by our commitment to creating effective, science-backed supplements. Every order you place helps us build a brand that values transparency, quality, and results.

It was my first time opening up to anyone about it online and it felt good to let everything out. i failed to state that i have been working out. Nothing much just some light stuff to get mostly toned and going on the treadmill for like 20 minutes at a low speed/high incline. Im mentioning this because while i don’t believe im doing it excessively/ i don’t think it’s contributing to my ed because its barely anything you’d call a workout, i did start cause i felt insecure about my body. I wanted a healthy way to achieve this, so this was my solution. More so on topic, this morning started off decently. I didn’t have anything going on today, so i slept in and woke up around 9:30. Ive always not been a breakfast person, so i didn’t eat breakfast. I state this because I know it can seem as if im starving myself and being in denial. Ive always been that way, ever since before my ed. I made myself a sweet cup of coffee and headed downstairs to workout around 11. I took a few breaks, tried to make my workout slow and calm ig, so i ended around 12. I then cooked a tortilla, got two turkey breast slices, got some cheese, and wrapped it up like a burrito. It was good, everything was going smooth. i also had like two small dill pickles because they’re good asf and small, so i wouldn’t spiral cuz “oh no i ate way too much food again!” i finished eating around 1. Im a slow eater, I’ve always been. i didn’t really notice how much time had passed and soon enough its 5:30 and i haven’t eaten anything since. I got up from the couch to eat something cuz im not stupid, im trying to recover and that to do that i have to eat. When i got up, i got really dizzy and lightheaded and fell on the floor for a whole 3-4 minutes. I was breathing really heavily before that when i was sitting on the couch but thats been happening a lot recently so i thought nothing of it. im just really scared. I don’t know what to do. As much as i love my sister, she would feel obligated to tell my parents and if they found out they’d yell and probably threaten to hit me, say im not normal, tell me i need therapy(yet refuse to get me one cuz they want to seem like good normal parents…like what tf??), and then ask me why i would do that and if im ashamed of what other people will think. again i just don’t know what to do.

I went no contact with both of my (separated) parents since they wouldn’t respect my (ftm) transition. I didn’t ask them to change their views (both of them very Christian) or to agree with my transition, I just asked them to respect me by calling me by my new name and not to refer to me as a she. When I told them both that I was going no contact, I let them both know that they are welcome to reach out as soon as they are willing to respect me. 

It took my mom a year to come around and finally start respecting me and our relationship has thankfully been rebuilding and has been pretty well ever since. 

My dad on the other hand hasn’t reached out since (except for texting me a simple happy birthday and merry christmas every year). But my father is also a very autistic and a to himself kind of man and has never really been one to reach out first to anyone about anything. So earlier this week I finally decided to reach out to him asking if he’d like to get coffee. He was actually very enthusiastic about it and offered to drive to me (we live an hour apart) instead of me going to him or meeting in the middle. So the effort so far is making me feel a little positive but we still haven’t brought up the issue of if we are going to continue to meet and rebuild our relationship, he has to respect me. 

Has anyone else given their no contact family another chance? How did that go? Incredibly nervous (but also a little excited and curious) about how it will go tomorrow. My fear is having to go through rejection again, but I think the chance of him possibly coming around and respecting me out ways that fear. ",1,1750974768.0,trans,1,1.0,False

1llcrp0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llcrp0,Review #18 WFPSP Loch & K(e)y microbatch Barrels 54 & 103 “Batch it Crazy”,"Review #18 WFPSP Loch & K(e)y microbatch Barrels 54 & 103 “Batch it Crazy” 

TLDR: 8; excellent pour, with an interesting concept of going from a single barrel to a micro batch. That additionally was elevated by the new WFP cigars that I paired with it. 

Nose: bourbon trinity (vanilla, oak, and caramel) come out strong, green apple skins start to slide in along with a mild note of sweet cinnamon, vanilla takes over the nose at the end with creamy crème brûlée style vanilla 

Palate: tart apple starts off with hints of black cherry to follow, a gentle warm hugging spice (similar to rye spice) comes in that has an extremely long finish that results in a a slight cinnamon note that leaves the palate wanting to come back in for another sip. 

Score: 8; what can I say? I truly love most of Loch & Keys picks. They just hit different, additionally with taking two barrels and making a micro batch it just brings a whole other level of flavor complexity that I don’t think that a lot of people choose to explore or really think of. In the past I’ve mixed similar products or completely different products to make a beyond amazing product, so why not do it on a larger scale? 

Cost: MSRP: $49.99; Secondary: $~250

Cigar notes: how do I do this? 
Before lighting- I get lots of coffee with a nuttiness to it and a sweet toffee at the end 

While smoking - super smooth, no burn or harshness. Gentle mocha notes and sweetness, perfect tobacco flavor that’s exactly what you want to pair with a full proof bourbon 

Cost: MSRP: $25; secondary: there’s a secondary? ~$45

2: Poor - Forced myself to drink it
3: Bad -  Heavily flawed

For the last 20 odd years, I've had a corner unit configuration in the big alcove and under the window, and some kind of corner sofa in the opposite corner. 

I'm so sick of this layout , mainly as it now reminds me of living here with my ex-husband and weirdly,  since his mother has died (they were estranged and i remained close to her) it's like finally a clean break and I need to make things different.

I've got rid of the old corner units and I'm trying out a media unit centered in the big alcove, so the TV is straight rather than at an angle.

With the room being the shape it is - the whole shape of it and alcoves asymmetrical, I don't know how to change the layout to be different,  but e.g. still see the TV from the sofas 

The only furniture I'd like to have/keep is my  3 seat sofa, 2 seat sofa (only slightly smaller) a coffee table, a side board  and book case, a corner shelving unit currently in the void between sofas. The tv unit could go.

 Full built in units in the alcoves is a possibility.  Removing the fire/fireplace is a possibility . Moving the TV position is a possibility - but do what in the alcove.  Sofa directly under the window is a no-no as the dogs would bark at the window. Only two plug points, one near the window,  one near the door 

Open to all ideas to best use space.  The diagram isn't to scale.. There's about 1.3 m between the end of the sofa and the radiator. Big alcove is 1.4 m

I've historically enjoyed doing monthly subscriptions for coffee with rotating offerings from favorite roasters, but my top local picks don't do more than 1 decaf blend.

Does anyone have recommendations for a good US-based subscription service similar to Death Before Decaf? I'm honestly considering signing up even with the US shipping costs, but shipping is almost doubling the price. ",2,1750974519.0,thirdwavedecaf,0,1.0,False

1llcmz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1llcmz1/i_think_my_childhood_friend_liked_me_at_one_point/,i think my childhood friend liked me at one point but i'm very bad at picking up on signs (long post),"i was going to post this on a throwaway account but i can't be bothered to make one so this message will self-destruct in maximum 1 week. i've told this history to 2 of my cousins who both came to the same conclusions but i want to make sure i'm definitely not delusional.

i have this guy friend i've known since middle school and we've known each other for at least 12 years now. we only became proper friends in high school because we had all of our STEM classes together and then we became good friends after we ended up at the same uni. as far as i was aware up until now things were completely platonic between us. in high school i confessed to him about a minor and short lived crush i had on him where he told me he did not feel the same and we went on as usual as if nothing had happened. halfway through uni our friend groups started hanging out together because it was easier to hog study spaces like that. after he broke up with his first serious girlfriend like halfway through uni and then he had a FWB situation going on with a couple of his friends which i pretended to know nothing about because it was messy and ridiculous. he's always been very insistent on introducing me to all of his girlfriends and i've gotten along great with all of them and i always respected those relationships. and also besides that moment in high school i never saw him in any other light other than as my friend.

i can't pinpoint exactly when things started to change but in hindsight it might have been around the time i went out for lunch with him and one of his FWB who i was also friends with and i remember this encounter because i knocked my fork off my plate and fumbled to catch it like a cartoon character and he burst into such loud laughter it startled me and when i looked at him he had this look of fondness on his face i'd never seen before that was extremely confusing to me at the time. he started dropping the odd compliment in conversation here and there which i thought was odd because that was never the vibe of our friendship but i thought nothing of it. i even helped him analyze what went wrong in the relationship after it was over to like try and be there for him as a good friend.

i would like to preface the following by saying that i'm an affectionate person with my friends regardless of gender. i hold hands, give hugs, sit on laps and it's completely normal however i did not do this with this man because it was not the nature of our friendship. anyway, we were in a study room alone once and we decided to watch a movie together so i went over to his side of the table and sat next to him. but we were sitting next to a large window and i couldn't see the screen properly so i moved to the window sill and he told me i'd be more comfortable sitting on his lap so that's what i did. my shirt had ridden up a little at my waist and he had one hand on my waist, and the other on my low back and he made some comment about my skin being soft and i absentmindedly asked him if he was expecting there to be snake scales instead. after the movie was over i got up and went back to my laptop and continued my work. later on while i was in the middle of talking about something he cut me off to remind me that he found me unattractive and wasn't into my like that. up until literally now i had not connected the dots i thought he was just being an a-hole so i said good i hope you don't because you're my friend and i don't want my friends to think that about me. it has been brought to my attention that he was trying to save face because i had not connected the comments with what had happened only a few hours ago.

there was another time when he invited me over to hang out in his new apartment and i went on because all of his other friends had already been. we made breakfast food and then lay down on his couch watching a show. we were basically cuddling as i was laying on top of him. there was a moment when one of his parents called and he answered but he was very abrupt and trying to hang up on them as soon as possible and i couldn't understand what the urgency was. the night ended with him falling asleep while spooning me and the whole time i was checking the time to see when i'd have to leave to catch the train on time.

he also had a hot tub and he would constantly invite me over and at first i didn't think anything of it because all of his friends had gone over for it but one time he invited me in the winter and i said no because i couldn't be bothered to do all that hair removal and he said something to the effect of i wouldn't need to because it's not a problem. and as you can imagine, i thought it was weird but moved on with my life.

we made one of those pacts with each other where if we were both single by the time we were 40 we'd get married and he agreed to it. but then when he'd bring up later in conversation he would lower the age to 30 and i thought he was just misremembering who i would correct him and say it was 40 and to stop shaving the years off.

one of the last things i remember is we made plans to go to a petting zoo. i was going to go with some other friends for a different reason which is why i didn't ask them and asked him instead. he said sure. we decided we'd carpool and he picked me up. while we were there they had like a target range for paintball guns and i wanted to go closer to check out the price before deciding if i wanted to pay or not. when i found out the price i decided it was too much for me but he paid for both of us. i was pleasantly surprised and a little confused because up until this point i can't remember if that man had ever even bought me a 2$ coffee. but i thought nothing of it. on the way back to the car he asks me what my halloween plans are and i told him a friend invited me to a party and he was encouraging me to go and have fun and make the most of being young (if you get my drift) and i was like probably not it's not really my style. and then he says oh i forgot to take a picture for my mom and i was like oh i can take a picture of you if you want so you can send it to her i just didn't realize you wanted one. i now think he meant a picture of US not of HIM. anyway, we get to his car and he unlocks the passenger door with his car (normal) and then opens the door for me and says see i can be a gentleman (not normal). i looked at him weird but said thanks and got in the car.

we decide to go for lunch because i skipped breakfast. once we're seated he asks me if i told my mom if i was hanging out with him specifically and i said no i said friends and she assumed it was my usual duo and i didn't correct her just in case she assumes it's a date and he goes oh yeah my moms the same. we eat and when the server comes around i ask for separate checks because i was under the impression i was hanging out with a friend. he drops me off and i said it was a lot of fun and that we should hang out more often and he agreed. and then he ghosted me. he had plans to hang out with another friend of ours and they texted me asking me to come along because they were worried about conversation running out and it being awkward and i said sure. so i texted him letting him know i'd be seeing him for that hangout and he cancelled on that friend and told her he had to work. the day of the hangout that he was supposedly working, i'm out with a friend and he's posted on his instagram story that he's out with his friends at the time he said he'd be working. i can't remember if i confronted him about it or not but i think i did. and then he completely ghosted me and i got the hint and stopped reaching out. anyway i'm beginning to think that was a date and not friends hanging out and i think i'm the last person to find out.

after about a year i texted him to ask what the hell happened. i can't remember the full answer of what he said but there was something about me not being nice to him or something and when i asked why he didn't say anything to me he said you don't seem like the kind of person who would care if i had said something so i said of course i'd care you're my friend i care about all of my friends??? i want to maintain my friendships with people??? anyway we put that to rest but we were still not speaking. not even a happy birthday the whole time.

i can't remember how much time passed after that but i think it was 2 years around my birthday he unfollowed me on instagram and removed me as a follower and unadded me on snapchat but because i wasn't the only one so i didn't give it any extra thought. then one week later and follows me back on all of those things and i once again was very perplexed but was like whatever and followed him back. and then  he wishes me a happy birthday to which i said thanks and gave him a thumbs up and then promptly forgot about it. i did not wish him a happy birthday. last year i don't get a happy birthday. in the fall i move away for uni and start posting on my insta story an occasional outfit checks because i felt like it. i had previously pretty much never done this before. but anyway, he starts liking all of them including the ones meant for comedy of me carrying all my groceries back from the store. i am normally not the kind of person who analyzes likes or views on instagram because it's literally never that serious but this was so entirely out of the ordinary for him that i did have to wonder what exactly is going on here. and at the same time he started posting what would be considered frequently for him of him taking his dog out for a walk like once every two weeks or once a week which is an increase from the zero it was before. some time around last month he posted on his story of him holding hands with someone while walking his dog, he liked one last outfit check after that and he hasn't done it since.

it has been seemingly obvious to everyone but me this entire time that he liked me as more than a friend at least a little. i was completely oblivious the whole time. i'd like to hear other people's thoughts on the situation and if you are also in agreement with other's assessment. i myself am still reeling with the realization so no i don't know how i feel and tbh even if i decided i had any interest there is nothing for me to do because he evidently has a girlfriend and i'm not the type of person to interfere and cause problems.",1,1750974337.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1llcl38,https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1llcl38/today_i_identified_myself_as_ace_in_public_for/,Today I identified myself as ace in public for the first time.,"My company has a pride event for staff every June which is just coffee and cake but still it's really nice. I usually paint my nails in bright rainbow colours both for the event, and the pride parade at the weekend.

I was doing my nails last night, trying to decide how I would paint the 7 colours on 10 fingers when I thought I could do red to blue on my left hand, then purple on my right thumb and then the rest of my hand in the ace colours.

Now, I don't publicly talk about my sexuality, ever. Only my closest friends know. Its not that I'm being secretive, its just I don't feel the need to say anything. Like it's a non-issue.

But somehow last night I actually wanted to do my nails with ace colours. So I did. 

And you know what? It still was a non-issue 😁. I showed some of my colleagues and explained the colours and they loved the idea and that was that.

So yeah. Just wanted to share!

1llcknj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1llcknj/lets_talk_about_solganda_for_a_minute/,Let’s talk about Solganda for a minute,"I really dig the George Van Tassel story. Short version - In the 50s Van Tassel who claimed to have direct ( as well as psychic) contact with a Venusian named Solganda who gave him plans for a longevity machine which was largely completed. The machine/building is the Integratron in Landers CA. It is bad ass. 

The podcast series Otherworld did a couple episodes on it recently, worthwhile.  

Anyhow, it got me to thinking how a lot of the “aliens” from the 50s era were Venusian or Martian. That is not at all part of the modern lore, probably because our probes have shown both these planets are crappy for advanced life. Now the aliens are from Sirius or Arcturus or another dimension or the future (I think the last two are most probable).

I believe something/someone did interact with Van Tassel out there at Giant Rock but it seems unlikely at best it was from Venus. The obfuscation and deception in the information given to contactees is baked into the experience. These entities seem to lie all the time.  Was old Solganda just laughing his ass off in another dimension watching the earth people build this cool looking but futile building for 20 years?

Often overlooked fun fact - the building is now owned by three sisters who are strangely beautiful in an unusual way. Kinda uncanny. You can go there and take a sound bath and they have T shirts and coffee cups and shit like that for sale.

This means I am the new head mod. I joined the team eight years ago because I know how to code and I made comics about an old Who Would Win folk hero, [Rational Man with a Shotgun](https://jer.art/comics/rmws/). These days, I'm just an old man who quietly trims shitposts over his morning coffee, doing what I can to keep this sub trimmed like a beloved topiary. 

I'd like to take a moment to ask folks for general feedback on the sub. I've been thinking about some updates to the rules, and I'd like to know what people think is working and what needs clarification. 

Generally, I want three things for the sub:

1. Keep things fun. 
2. Keep threads on topic. 
3. Keep this a safe space for everyone.

Feel free to reply to this thread with your thoughts. What makes this a fun sub? What should we consider off-topic? How are you enjoying the events?

I'm living with non-carnivores. When they eat pies or pizza the smell makes me hungry and I miss pastry. I started three and a half years ago.

I guess my occasional use of weed or magic mushrooms doesn't help. Black coffee doesn't help. Also I can't digest much fat so my carnivore diet is high protein. I just eat the meat as it comes, because I can't take the diarrhea.

When i get carb cravings I tell myself that the yeasts and cancers in my body wants to be fed. I still get random cravings for carrot cake, even though I was not a sweet tooth, its pastries that I miss. I was raised on home made puddings, as in our family would eat plenty of meat and veg then consume a large pudding on top of that, every night. We also had homemade baking for morning and afternoon snacks.

Anyway this morning I remember part of a dream, someone was cooking pancakes, I rushed over and asked her to make me some pancakes, saying I'm on the carnivore diet but I have to have some pancakes now. I don't care about anything anymore, just make me some pancakes...

The only thing that would make me go off this diet is a financial disaster or an apocalyptic event. Just saying, no the cravings don't go away.",1,1750974093.0,carnivorediet,0,0.67,False

I have a few social hobbies I partake in regularly, but those local communities are mostly tapped for me except for the slow drip of newbies, which just requires time and showing up on my part.

I don't do much solo that isn't a structured activity like a sport or a gathering to do a specific thing, so it feels like unstructured outings are the next best way to challenge myself. 

For those of you that do unstructured things solo to meet people—not necessarily solely for dating—what do you do, and does it work for dating or for making friends?

I've never been much into the bar scene but I could give it a shot again. I thought about starting to work at a coffee shop or a co-working space even though I have a great home setup I love.

It's summer now so I could just go wander around the outdoor concert events, markets, fairs, festivals, etc... but that seems boring, and really hot, to do alone.

Help me get more creative, past my limiting assumptions, and set myself up to have fun? I've always been a bit of a loner and kind of a boring person in social settings. I haven't been liking much of anything or my own company all that much lately and I want to get over this funk.

One topic that keeps coming up in every book or podcast is delegation, so I’ve been trying to put that into practice—and also paying close attention to how my own manager delegates.

The thing is, I’ve noticed that she delegates almost everything—even when the team is swamped. She’ll pass off tasks that she could easily handle herself, and meanwhile, we see her walking around the office chatting or going for coffee breaks.

Personally, I don’t think that’s right. If my team is drowning, shouldn’t I step in and help? Or at the very least, filter or push back on some of the incoming tasks instead of just tagging someone in the email thread and moving on.

It’s got me thinking—where does her role actually come into play? Maybe I’m missing something, but I’d really appreciate an outside perspective on this. How do you strike the right balance between delegating and jumping in to do the work yourself?",5,1750973890.0,managers,5,0.78,False

Plz read.,"** GOING TO PREFACE THIS BY SAYING I have ADHD lol and can overthink things a lot, I sometimes spiral when I feel regret or confusion —  this post is long but pls read it if u feel called and know it comes from a humble, confused, insight seeking place :). I love this community down.

~ You guyssss idk what I did wrong. I’ve been working this money spell for a minute now and it’s brought nothing but AMAZING work opportunities, continuous, so obviously magical. All in a short period. I feel it working all the time, we’ve just established the most gorgeous back and forth flow of energy with each other (my $ alter and I). It’s like a bond w someone alive and I cherish it, but im worried i did something wrong.

Last night for the new moon I decided to refresh it. I wanted to move it to a bigger bowl to symbolize this new tier of income I’ve reached and the bigger opportunities/career I now have. My mom, siblings and I all exchanged pics of our alters last night and everything felt really good. When I transferred mine to the bigger bowl I made a small mistake.. maybe it’s not a mistake. But instead of transferring the rice (that I use as a base) from my original bowl over, I accidentally used all new rice. I meant to transfer my old rice over and just addd a bit more new rice to fill it out more. Everything else (herbs, crystals, stones, photos, money, business cards, etc) I just transferred. When I was about to light my candle I realized I still had the rice from the old bowl, and instead of taking everything out, incorporating it into the new bowl and placing everything right back in, I decided to get rid of the rice by pouring it outside as an offering. It was late, i didn’t feel like starting my bowl over so I took a shortcut rather than retrace my steps. I seriously wasn’t thinking– totally harmful for birds or squirrels to eat dry rice 😭 but I did it.

Secondly, I did a freezer spell on someone yesterday. Been kind of regretting it, first time doing baneful magic and just isn’t sitting right with me. I really put my all into it too.

Well, today I wake up and go to work then the DMV. Get to the dmv and realize I forgot a document (my lease agreement) so I have my mom go do that while I wait for them to call my #. Trying to be quick for me, she accidentally prints all 38 pages in color instead of B&W costing me nearly $40 instead of $10. I got super pissed and couldn’t stop thinking about it, or how to get my $ back somehow, but there was nothing I could do. I was so irritated. Esp since I already had a physical copy of my lease at home -__-  it was more expensive than the ID I was getting @ the DMV it just irritated me BEYONDDD but I released it eventually and accepted my fate. Then, on my way home I stopped at the grocery store to get milk and water bottles. Carrying it up the stairs I had no help opening the door so while struggling to balance everything I dropped the milk carton and it exploded and spilled everywhere. I get the expensive organic milk w DH Omega 3 brain healthy etc etc… GONE. I got sooo pissed and over stimulated. Was like $10 milk (which is nuts) not a large amount of $ in general hut still, it stood out to me and felt symbolic. “Crying over spilt milk” came to mind, and so did “leaking money”. Felt like maybe I did something wrong in my spell work and accidentally poked a hole in my pockets and ran a leak. ESP bc I associate whole milk / heavy cream with richness and use it a lot in my money work depending on what I’m doing (is that strange?), so it definitely felt symbolic that that’s what spilt of all things and I also really did wanna cry lol.

Hoping to bounce ideas off community- do u think this is happening because: 

1. I threw away the rice from my old bowl, leading to me “throwing away” $ twice today, and if so should I
      a. Go outside and try and scoop it all up from the planters and salvage it or is it a lost cause?
      b. Try and atone some other way. 
  
2. Because I did a freezer spell on someone who’s extremely unkind to me but ultimately, doesn’t deserve how harsh I made the spell (he’s old, stuck in his ways, and dealing w so many things it’s kind of shitty of me to make his situation any nastier, despite him maybe deserving it). Maybe the energy of that spell ricocheted off me? Maybe his guides are sending it back to me lol? Maybe I somehow am sending the energy to myself since I included my DNA in the freezer spell (I used some of my .. u know..🍺💦 … 😔not proud) plus some mirror shards, so maybe I’m accidentally reflecting the nastiness back onto me?!?! Lmao. I know , a stretch. But still! Nothing’s a stretch really. I likely will unfreeze him either way..

3. One thing that kept coming to mind as both these things happened was “ thank God I’m in a position to afford these random charges and it’s not hurting my finances”. Because ultimately these were not make or break amounts , I just grew up with so little that it’s a reflex to get extremely pissed when I waste money. So a part of me feels like maybe this is the next level of abundance? Like a new territory to occupy and a test of my commitment to the feeling of abundance .. you know? I still think it’s important to respect money and not waste it, but to be able to afford these curveballs is a blessing and another demonstration of the abundance I’ve accumulated since working this spell. I gotta say, this one feels more like a way for me to take solace in the series of unfortunate events more so than the cause. However, since both situations could have easily been avoided and something about how they each happened felt very loud, I do think it’s deeper than that. Like a message or lesson I’m supposed to receive?

4. I usually put a fresh cup of hot coffee with sugar and milk and cinnamon on my money alter every single morning. Today I was out of milk (hence why I bought more) so I had to do black coffee and sugar only. Is this happening because my altar/the spirit associated with my altar is unhappy with black coffee and is lashing out? Lol. Honorable mention, maybe he made me spill the milk because he liked the black coffee more and didn’t want the milk? (Yes…I know..I hear myself. But you guys these are seriously the thoughts that go through my head!!!! I consider any and every possibility all the time…. I’m not well)

LASTLY, 5. None of this means anything and at all. It’s all a coincidence, I’m just overthinking and trying to make something out of nothing. (It’s not nothing). ORRR in the same breath….all of the above? Ahh.


I know this is unhinged, I just really fucking appreciated the results I yielded in my previous money bowl and couldn’t bear making a silly mistake and destroying all my progress. I’ll go out and pick up every grain of rice one by one if I have to. I’ll apologize. I’ll go get fresh milk right now and make a proper cup of Joe for my alter. Idk. Pls help, sometimes I can spiral a bit when I’m stuck. I’m not a baby witch by any means, but not advanced or anything. Just a house witch who practices based entirely off intuition, family traditions, and internet discourse here and there. I rarely get to bounce ideas off of anyone outside my family and have always just figured everything out on my own based on intuition or divination. My head is too loud right now tho and I can’t hear what’s coming from where. Important to note, nothing else has changed. Still getting new work opportunities even in the one hour it’s been since I spilled the milk lol , so I don’t think it’s totally ruined but I do think there’s a message for me here somewhere . Maybe writing this out was to help me identify them on my own? Your opinions are so deeply valued in advance. 🫶

1llce4x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1llce4x,"Heft (*) - High Newton, England","This review serves two purposes. The first is to give an outline of the lunch that I had at Heft, the night after staying at L'Enclume and dining at the restaurant (see my previous post for details on the food at L'Enclume). The lunch menu at Heft is shorter (and with different dishes) than what one would get during the dinner service. As such, while one can't with 100% confidence extrapolate the quality of the dinner from the lunch, this can at least serve as a baseline for that (on average, I would not expect a longer menu - the ""full"" menu - to be a worse experience than the abridged menu).

The second purpose is to give an account of the stay at the rooms at L'Enclume and the overall experience (because while centred on food, it does go beyond this). While this is a fine dining subreddit, it stands to reason that most people that visit L'Enclume will be travelling from further afield than Cartmel, and will be overnighting. As such, you may be wondering if dropping roughly £650 (you get more than just the meal for this, sure, but this is the price of entry) is really worth it. I think it is, and I'll give reasons for that after the account of Heft.

So: Heft. From the menu notes:

'Like the Herdwick [sheep native to the Lake District], Kevin & Nicola Tickle are 'hefted' to Cumbria.

Nicola is from a family that have continuously farmed the fells and valleys of the Lake District since the 1600s. 

Kevin, also Cumbrian born, was taught by his father to forage and fish. He understands the rhythms of the lakes, becks, heaths and the sea.

They are of this landscape.

Cumbria is their 'heft'.'

'They are of this landscape' says perhaps all you need to know of not just Heft, but many of the food producers in this region. Kevin Tickle, the man behind the stoves, spent nine years working at L'Enclume with Simon Rogan, where he worked his way up to sous chef and head forager. He then became the head chef at Rogan & Co, before moving to Forest Side in Grasmere to take up the head chef position there, earning a Michelin star for the restaurant eight months after its launch. Not content with an already impressive résumé, in 2021 Kevin and Nicola opened Heft in a 17th Century inn in High Newton (just shy of a ten minute drive from Cartmel). While the locals might not have been completely enamoured with the prospect of a fine dining establishment in their village at first, this changed with the promise of quality ales on tap in the bar. Two years after opening, Heft earned its first Michelin star. Mention a trip to Heft during a visit to L'Enclume, and you'll be met with unanimous enthusiasm. There's a real collegiate atmosphere that is hard-pressed not to lift the spirits.

Just past the bar lies the dining room, where - during the lunch service I attended, at least - patrons are served their courses at the same time; no staggering takes place. This is good if you enjoy some breathing space between courses, but not so much if you prefer to set your own pace.

The two appetizers - served together - were both rich and toothsome, the cheddar in particular being pleasingly potent. If that wasn't strong enough, the thyme custard with enoki was a powerbomb of flavour. The influence of the custard and oyster dish at L'Enclume is clearly in evidence, but while that dish gives a rounded blend of umami and sweetness, this is one big concentrated hit of umami, which I was all for after the already strong opening.

The potato and onion pavé with smoked sour cream and dill, by contrast, didn't quite work for me. The dill was muted and the potato somewhat tough; if the former had been used more liberally and the latter had been cooked to a pleasing softness, I think the dish would have been a more suitable follow-up to the enoki dish. What probably didn't help was that I was provided a fork and spoon, but no knife; never a fun job cutting through something tough with a round object.

After this came the main course of the lunch, the BBQ lamb rump with sauerkraut, chimichurri sauce and shallot purée. The lamb was pink and tender, the chimichurri rather light in all of consistency, flavour and application. I would have loved to have more lamb for the main, but given this is a lunch menu that costs £45, one can hardly be up in arms over this. The dessert was a high note to end the meal on, the goat's milk giving a slight smoky counterpoint to the peppery marigold and acid from the fruit.

This was a very enjoyable lunch, and one I can happily recommend if you're in the area (and if you're going for L'Enclume, then why not).

Courses:
1. Bresaola, mushroom and Gouda crumpet
2. Dale End cheddar, onion and Worcester croustade (pictured first)
3. Thyme custard, smoked enoki and tarragon dashi
4. Potato & smoked onion pavé, Ogleshield, pickled, smoked sour cream and dill
5. BBQ lamb rump, alliums, peppercorn & chimichurri sauce
6. Blackcurrant, goat milk, marigold, honeycomb crunch

Now for the second purpose, as mentioned above. There are probably several places you can stay in the area, be that in Cartmel, High Newton, Grange-over-Sands, or further afield. However, I chose to book a room at L'Enclume primarily because you are able to reserve a seat for dinner for a night during your stay (of course, you can reserve without staying at L'Enclume, but the whole process was just simple and lo, here I am in all my laziness). Also included is breakfast at Rogan & Co (which is a short three course consisting of a cinnamon slice, fry up with toast and butter, and a takeaway flapjack for dessert. The first two of these are pictured after the Heft lunch menu), as well as cookies in the room (yeah sure, the room has the usual amenities one would expect, but cookies, ya know). There is a welcome pack provided when you enter the room (the latter of which may be situated at the restaurant, or a couple of streets away in the village; there are multiple locations), which includes notes on good shops and pubs to visit in Cartmel (such as the Rogan shop, the local cheesemongers, and the four pubs of the village), as well as walks around the fells if you have the time and energy to adorn your walking boots.

The shop has a number of preserves, vinegars, rubs, and coffee (the same coffee that is served for breakfast at Rogan & Co, made in conjunction with the Yorkshire-based Dark Woods). During summer (May through September) it is possible to book a L'Enclume farm visit, and - as with Heft - there are several fine restaurants in the Lake District that commenters have mentioned in my previous post on L'Enclume.

All of this is to say, a trip to Cartmel, High Newton, and around is a delight for those with an interest in gastronomy and/or the nature of rural England. Make the most of it by booking a table at these fine restaurants!

1llcdzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1llcdzr/what_should_i_have_done_in_this_situation/,What should I have done in this situation?,Okay so. I’m sure everyone knows the “hack” on how to order and brown sugar and hazelnut shaken espressos in a way to make it cheaper and while I’m all for it I’m just wondering if I could’ve done something different to avoid this situation. Someone came into our drive thru this morning and ordered a hazelnut shaken espresso “deconstructed” (their words not mine lol) and I had asked what they meant by that and they responded with “ I want a hazelnut shaken espresso but rung in as a standard shaken espresso because it’s too expensive.” My SM doesn’t want us to ring in shaken espresso’s in that way if a customer orders it like that we have to ring it up as that certain drink (except if they mobile order it nothing we can really do lol). But I had explained that to them and they like immediately got upset over the fact I apparently “didn’t want them to save their money” which in my opinion someone who comes in almost every day for a $7-$8 coffee they’re already spending like crazy. Once they got to the window they wanted to talk to my SM who wasn’t even there yet and physically refused to leave the drive thru even though they already paid and got their drink. Should I have just rung it up as a standard espresso and just add the modifications since it wasn’t that big of a deal? They ended up leaving a review about how rude I was to them even though I wasn’t so I’m just confused on if it’s really that deep or not?,1,1750973701.0,starbucks,3,0.67,False

I've got 250 EUR for the project and basically narrowed down my selection to three grinders - I'd highly appreciate your advice and experiences with any of these!

Eureka Mignon Manuale for 250 EUR: I really like the tank-like build quality, easy repairability and general institutional knowledge with the Mignon series, which makes it my first option now. I'd also mod it for single dosing, but as I've seen, it's pretty easy to do. However I am a bit worried about the ""only"" 50mm burrs - is it a major difference to 54 or 64mm burrs in grind quality? 

DF54 for 250 EUR: The quality is also said to be good with this one, the 54mm burrs should produce better results than the Mignon and I also like the design. But since it's a less known brand, what are the experiences with repairability, longevity, reliability and ease of cleaning the burrs?

Shardor 64mm as a dark horse option for 180 EUR: honestly, I don't know what to think. I don't like the plasticky build, but the specs look almost too good to be true Those who've had/tried the machine praised it overall, but a 64mm grinder for 1/3 of the price of a DF64 - where's the catch?

mainly looking for stuff that might be fun to check out around 8pm-12am saturday or sunday? not necessarily have to be open that entire time. whether it be a cute store, arcade, coffee/dessert stop, etc. it's fine if they serve alcohol (i'm 22) but nowhere that is 21+.

It started when I began my degree. I met this girl at uni. She was cute, funny, kind someone I felt really connected to. We got close over time, worked on assignments together, talked a lot. I found out she lived near my house, though she stayed in the hostel. I started falling for her. Hard.

Then one day, I saw her at a coffee shop near our neighborhood with another guy from our class. A tall, attractive guy. Later I found out they started dating after she broke up with her old boyfriend. That was when it hit me: she was never into me. I was just the convenient “nice guy” for study sessions.

It hurt, but what crushed me was that he looked like a damn movie star. Seriously. Like Chris Hemsworth tall, sharp jawline, confident, the kind of guy you’d expect to be the lead in every room. Meanwhile, I’m short, average looking at best. And no matter how hard I worked getting fit, being kind, doing well in class none of it mattered. I lost to something I could never change: genetics.

She never even messaged me during breaks, even though she came home nearby. It made me realize I was never someone she missed. That realization broke me. I started to hate her. Not because she owes me anything but because I felt like I was fed lies. I had delusional hopes. I thought there was something there. But she was never into me not even a little.

Another example:
And then, there’s my friend. This guy is a walking stereotype of the “hot asshole” loud, kinda arrogant, full of himself and debt but he’s attractive and tall. And I’ve watched him easily get with multiple girls in club. Girls keep preaching on the internet, “I want someone kind,” “personality is what matters,” etc. And then they go fall for that kind of guy. I know I sound bitter, but it mess with your head after a while. It feels like everything I was told growing up about kindness, personality, effort was just bullshit. All self inprovement are just lie and attractive assholes always win. 

I’ve started to feel like I’m becoming an incel. I hate thinking this way. I don’t want to hate women. I don’t want to be jealous or bitter. But I’m hurting. I feel invisible. Replaceable. Like no matter what I do, I’ll never win because I wasn’t born tall or good looking.

I’ve had suicidal thoughts lately. I’m not planning to act on them or plan to live longer, but they’re there. I feel like life is just a long, slow process of proving I’ll never be enough for the world. That I’ll always be overlooked. If you look my post history and comments I believe I too far gone and unsaveable. 

I don’t want to live like this. I don’t want to become toxic. I don’t want to be hateful. I just want to be wanted. I want to be loved for who I am. But I don’t see how that ever happens anymore…..",1,1750973157.0,GuyCry,4,1.0,False

New job. Warehouse. They’ve got a scanner system from the Stone Age and a conveyor belt that sounds like it’s powered by regret and loose screws. I’m maybe 4 days in. Still shadowing someone who couldn’t care less whether I live, die, or accidentally ship a crate full of propane tanks to a preschool.

Enter Brad. Of course.

Brad is my direct supervisor. Think dad-energy mixed with micromanagement trauma and a passive-aggressive printer repair guy who never left 2006. He talks down to everyone like we’re NPCs in his weird little warehouse simulation. On my second day, I made the critical mistake of touching the print queue because a label was stuck — and Brad materialized out of thin air like a Dollarama Sith Lord:

“DON’T touch anything unless you’ve been trained. That’s policy.”

Cool. Got it. Hands off. You’re the label lord, Brad.

Fast forward a few days later. I’m on break — eating a crushed granola bar near the back wall, because the lunchroom smells like regret and old chili — when I hear the unmistakable sound of mechanical screaming. The conveyor belt is smoking. Not metaphorically. There’s literal smoke coming from it. Something’s jammed, grinding against something else, and the scanner’s blinking like it’s begging for mercy.

People are looking around. One guy yells, “Kill the belt!”
Brad? Nowhere. Poof. Probably off somewhere filing his weekly complaint about morale.

So what do I do?
Absolutely nothing.
Because Brad said: don’t touch it unless you’re trained.

I even pointed at the smoking belt and said, “I haven’t been trained on that,” with the same tone you’d use to say, “That’s not my baby.”

Eventually, someone from a different department comes flying in like they’re in a Fast & Furious spin-off and yanks the emergency stop. But not before two boxes burst open, one full of powdered coffee creamer (RIP) and the other containing a surprise shipment of mini hand sanitizers.

The place looked like a crime scene from the world’s saddest office party.

Later, Brad storms in with his “I’m not mad, I’m disappointed” face, demanding to know why no one shut it off.

So I look him dead in the eye and say:

“You told me not to touch it unless I was trained. And guess what — still not trained.”

Dead silence. Then someone snorted. Then someone else started laughing. Brad turned the color of a stop sign.
I didn’t get written up.
I did get trained on the belt — the next day.
And now? People joke that if something breaks, I just shrug and say, “Not my lane.”

1llc3j6,https://i.redd.it/38ufbqkl9c9f1.jpeg,FTC releases top text scams from 2024,"


have to say I am sad to admit, but I have seen a lot of posts for potential jobs and like many of which fall under this category. Don’t be a victim if it sounds to be too good. It probably is trust your gut. 



Top Text Scams of 2024

The report identifies the top five text scams, which together account for about half of all text frauds reported to the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network in 2024:

1. Fake Package Delivery Problems

Messages about package deliveries, often impersonating the U.S. Postal Service, were the most reported scam. Victims were told there was a problem with their delivery and tricked into paying a small “redelivery fee,” which was a ploy to steal their credit card or Social Security numbers.

2. Phony Job Opportunities

Scammers posed as recruiters offering vague job opportunities. The so-called “task scam” involved victims completing simple tasks, like rating products or apps, and then being asked to send money to withdraw their earnings, which they never received back.

3. Fake Fraud Alerts

Texts mimicking banks or companies like Amazon warned of suspicious activity or large purchases. Victims who responded were connected to fake fraud departments and pressured into transferring money to “secure” accounts, which were controlled by the scammers.

4. Bogus Notices About Unpaid Tolls

Scammers sent texts resembling toll program notifications, prompting victims to click links to pay fake unpaid balances. These scams aimed to steal credit card and Social Security numbers.

5. “Wrong Number” Texts

These scams began with seemingly innocent messages from strangers, like “hello” or “do you want to get a coffee.” Scammers built fake friendships with victims, often with romantic undertones, and eventually lured them into bogus investment schemes, resulting in significant financial losses.

To combat these scams, the FTC recommends that consumers never click on links or respond to unexpected texts and to utilize available tools to block unwanted texts.

Directly from the FTC:

Here are some things you can do to help stop text scams:

Forward messages to 7726 (SPAM). This helps your wireless provider spot and block similar messages.

Report it on either the Apple iMessages app or Google Messages app for Android users.

Report it to the FTC at ReportFraud.ftc.gov.

\- Ideally, we'd stay and cowork in the same general area and must be near a metro station.  
\- We're looking at a 4-bedroom apartment or individual hotel rooms, but if there is a coliving/coworking, we'd consider it (I just don't want to be 4 of 6 people staying there, so either it's only us or it's big enough that we're not disrupting the dynamic and can do our own thing)

**More about us:**

* 2 of 4 are fluent Spanish speakers
* Age group: 30-45 - Youthful, trendy, modern vibes, but not at all edgy (if this makes sense?)
* We like authentic/local vibes, but 1 person is not well-traveled so possibly will feel more comfortable if we're not totally off the beaten track

Hey, MaximizeMe fam! 🙌

Ever find yourself staring at the clock, wondering how it's only 11 AM but you already feel like a deflated balloon? 🎈 Yeah, me too. It’s like I’ve run a marathon (or just *thought* about getting off the couch). 

But before you reach for that third cup of coffee (guilty as charged!), let’s chat about something that might just change your morning game: **Energy Priming**. Sounds fancy, right? But it’s super simple and, trust me, WAY more effective than coffee (sorry, Mr. Java!).

### What is Energy Priming?

It’s essentially boosting your energy through specific actions and habits that set a positive tone for your day. No jittery feelings or midday crashes here!

**Here’s how to kickstart your mornings without the caffeine:**

1. **Get Moving! 🏃‍♀️**
   - Just 5-10 minutes of physical activity can ramp up your endorphins. A quick dance-off in your living room? Yes, please!

2. **Hydrate Like a Champion 💧**
   - First thing in the morning, drink a glass of water. Your body will thank you, and it helps get those sleepy muscles firing up again.

3. **Breathe It Out 🌬️**
   - Take a minute for some deep breathing. Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 4, and exhale through your mouth for 6. It feels great! It’s like giving your body a wake-up hug.

4. **Nourish Your Brain 🧠**
   - Snack on some brain-boosting foods. Think nuts, yogurt, or fruit! Seriously, it makes a difference. Those ripe bananas? A natural energy booster!

5. **Set a Mini Intention for the Day 🎯**
   - Grab a sticky note and write down one intention for the day. It can be as simple as “today, I will smile at 5 people.” It keeps you focused and engaged.

6. **Choose Your Vibe 🎶**
   - Create a morning playlist that pumps you up. Music can change your energy levels like nothing else! Who knew a good beat could banish that mid-morning slump?

### Why Does This Work?

We've been conditioned to believe that caffeine is our only savior, but the truth is, our bodies thrive on natural methods of energizing. Think about it: when was the last time you truly listened to what your body needed? 

And let's be real — those 3 PM coffee crashes can be a major *buzzkill* (pun intended). 

### The Best Part? 

You don’t have to overhaul your life to feel energetic. Just a few minutes of intentional actions can shift your day from ""meh"" to ""heck yeah!"" 

So, are you ready to experiment with Energy Priming? Or are you still going to cling to that coffee cup like a lifeline? 😅 Either way, let’s hear your stories! What energizes YOU in the mornings?

Wait I don't think that made any sense. 

No, it's actually simply because I know I'll be overstimulated. Like that day I taught three classes! They all went pretty well in the end, and by the time I got to campus my head was in the clouds. I continued with my day, obviously, but I was in such a good mood that I'm pretty sure if disaster would have struck I would have just stared, open mouthed and wide eyed, like a goldfish. 

Lmaooo okay that might be pushing it. But also it's possible. Anything goes, just saying. It's kind of like how I end up writing here, and I get silly and stupid and emotional and a little unhinged. Like, yeah, to some extent it is my actual self, but I've forced it away for so much of my life that it actually feels so distant from me. I wish I knew how to decrease that disconnect, but having a voice and being listened to are just things that feel so foreign that most of the time I just don't bother. I got sick of my mom calling me crazy or weird, or the countless number of times my brother has turned to me and been like ""since when are you actually funny."" People suck. And ironically, I'm way better at befriending strangers than I am with people I've already known a while. I remember last semester I felt like I had to mention that I had trouble speaking up, and my mentor teacher looked at me and was like ""really?? I couldn't even tell"" and that was when it started to click that most people don't necessarily see me that way... and the people who do just don't know the story. The truth is I feel more myself when I'm in front of people, or surrounded by them, preferably people that are semi new to me who don't already have any kind of misconceptions about who I am. 

And I know you're probably shaking your head at me, like it's not too late, but that's not what I'm getting at, although I wish more of them were a tad more responsive sometimes, but imma be bribing D into coffee when I come back. Okay, it's not a *bribe*, she payed last time so I figure I will this time. I also still reallyyyy need to try that place near my house. How have I not done it yet?! We'll actually I know how. It's always busy during the day, and not a great area in the evening.

Oh, how the fuck have I gone this long without roping them into a karaoke night?! 

Ummmmmmmm. Oh yeah. Reasons for anxiety. Someone once asked if I thought that we were feeding off of each other's anxiety last spring. We absolutely do that. People around me crying and upset often= anxiety, trainwreck, mood swings. Which doesn't bode well for this summer. I am being driven insane by these people eeeeek. My family is best in small doses. Would honestly almost be willing to move out right now if I were to hear back from one of these jobs. Don't hold me to that though, obviously. 

I mean, at least the chaos has an actual reason this time. Then again, there's always a reason, isn't there? Flying out to see my grandparents this weekend. Don't know when we're coming back though. Really hope it's before my birthday. I wanted to at least be with my friends. Idk maybe do something. I guess it's okay if we aren't, but it'd stink not being with my dad and brother. My brother's birthday is the day before mine. I take it as a personal attack that we never did Max and Ruby cakes. That would actually be adorable. Oh yeah, I completely forgot he's turning 21. We missed my 21st birthday. It sounds weird saying it like that, I missed my own birthday. I don't know, we did. I was trying to use that orientation as an excuse to come back early, but I don't even know when it is. 

Oh. The reason for the trip. My uncle had to have an emergency surgery a couple of days ago. They wanted to airlift him to another hospital, but they didn't have the time. We don't know how it happened, we think there must be something running in the family. It progressed over time, and for whatever reason he wouldn't see a neurologist. His appointment is the 9th. Definitely won't be back for Dyl. Maybe not for me either. It's okay though. Anyway his spinal cord was compressed in his neck. I hope that they get answers and that he can regain some of his movements. I'm promising myself I'll visit him in the hospital at least once. I don't like hospitals, I don't like seeing people in pain. Especially family, obviously. 

We aren't close, and he gets on my nerves, but I love him. He's diagnosed with some other mental illnesses, which also include mood swings and anxiety, so he'd lash out over nothing and it'll make my anxiety boil over sometimes. We've never snapped at each other, but we've probably both gotten annoyed with how the other acted. He also used to ask me weird questions. Some of which weren't super appropriate, which is why I always kinda avoided him. He is harmless, just kinda strange sometimes. Every time I used to visit, he'd ask me how I feel about LGBTQ+. I always made a face and told him that I support it since many of my friends are part of the community. Never really had it in me to come out to him. I did buy pride things with him around one year though.

Anyway though, as strange as he can be, he's also the first person to try and help others. He's the type of person who always gives money to people on the street, of course the family had to talk to him about that. As you can probably guess, he's very religious. Hmm, I wonder if his seeming radicalism is because he's a convert? That's kinda interesting, I think. 

Anyway, hope he gets better. I know it has to feel horrible to be in that condition. I also know that my grandparents, who care for him, have really been stressed and overworked. They should have taken him to the hospital sooner. They're not in very good health either and they kept having to lift him and feed him and everything. My grandparents are the best. My grandpa isn't close to me, although I look up to him. He's not really the affectionate type. But my grandma is my everything. Bad ass. Came to this country not really knowing English well, worked two jobs and went to school part time, had two kids and still takes care of one of them. 

Idk I'm home now and I better get in the shower. I think that's a good place to leave off. I also better figure out what I need to pack.",1,1750972269.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False
1llbqoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Step2/comments/1llbqoq/us_md_micro_optimizations_to_improve_score_for/,[US MD] Micro Optimizations to Improve Score for Any/Every Question,"Dear community,

US MD here who just finished a 6 week dedicated and took the exam on 06/24. I don't know what has gotten into me but I woke up with a raging fire in my belly and on a whim decided to write this manifesto. Like many I was a lurker for the greater part of a year and looked to this place for practical advice on how to improve. I managed to pick up bits and pieces of advice from posts, scattered here and there, and during dedicated wished there was one consolidated resource test taking improvement. Here are my tips that can be applied to **any problem**, without knowing what your weakness is. **Tl;dr: changing BEHAVIORS will most likely influence the probability of getting ANY question correct, rather than studying more content.** If this sounds obvious to you then skip on ahead, but taking time to study cardiomyopathy might improve the chances of getting cardiomyopathy question right, but will it improve the chances of you getting glomerulonephritis questions right?

To preface, I found most advice on this forum not very substantive and lacking in insight. This is not a criticism (okay it might be just a little), but a statement on the amount of noise inherent to STEP2. While it is true everyone's preparation and test day experience is unique, **I truly believe there are unifying underlying lessons that we can all learn from that deserves to be fleshed out in writing.** I curated tips that had rationale behind them beyond blindly trusting that doing more questions / 'working harder' will somehow bring up my score.

The problem I want to discuss is **how to improve your chances of solving clinical problems, given a finite amount of studying time (<8 weeks).** The time constraint is both a stressor and a limitation: it's not always possible to improve substantially (I didn't). I took a 6 week dedicated, and took NBMEs once a week: NBME 10 245 | NBME 11 240 | NBME 13 242 | NBME 14 241 | NBME 12 243 | NBME 15 247. I worked pretty diligently and tried all sorts of things - while my scores didn't really improve **my test taking confidence definitely did, so take from that what you will.**

**1. Instead of studying topics & factoids, study frameworks (aka clinical algorithms) that allow you to 'solve' a problem.**

\- This principle is directly aligned with some of the Quality Improvement we have to know: **standardization through algorithms builds (1) reliability and (2) reproducibility.** There are going to be scenarios on 2CK that we cannot anticipate. But having a robust framework for solving classes of problems - even if the new scenario tugs at the seams of the algorithms - provides a methodology for solving new scenarios we haven't seen before. **I found the ""First Aid Clinical Algorithms for USMLE Step2 CK""** very helpful in this regard (https://www.amazon.com/First-Clinical-Algorithms-USMLE-Step/dp/1264270135).

\- For instance, I'm not much of an ophtho guy and previously I just took an L on ophtho questions, and relied on the scattered vignettes I saw on UWorld. Turns out there's an algorithm for eye trauma in the First Aid book that walked me through the key clinical signs we should be looking out for (ie. 1) is there blood visible in the eye? -> 2) is there APD? 3) is there vision loss? ) and I found after learning this framework it was pretty easy to 'solve' ophtho questions, even if I didn't know the diagnosis off the top of my head.

\- In addition for helping me build frameworks for solving classes of problems (ie. eye trauma), it also connected together algorithms I previously learned separately. This helped me partially solve the **anchoring bias** problem where my mind would immediately anchor to an answer without considering the ""flip"" possibility, when all this time two algorithms I previously learned were actually joined in a tree whose ""root"" problem is really important and one I should be asking myself all the time (eg. is it a wheeze or stridor).

\- Finally, just to circle back to the original point, it allowed me to reproducibly answer questions. I took it for granted that if I got an NBME question right that I will definitely get it right the second time, but turns out my brain has day-to-day variations in decision making that surprised me (seriously, try it for yourself: make yourself an Anki card of an NBME question with the answer choices in the front, and you'll find that you won't always get the right answer). Algorithms helped standardized my approach to problems and made my performance more consistent. **If this is a weakness for you, then I recommend looking at the FA Algorithms book.**

**2.  Approach every problem with the same system.**

I came across the book ""Test-Taking Strategies for the USMLE STEP 2 Exam: Proven Methods to Succeed"" [https://www.amazon.com/Test-Taking-Strategies-USMLE-STEP-Exam/dp/1264258755](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Taking-Strategies-USMLE-STEP-Exam/dp/1264258755) and true to the reviews, found it remarkably clarifying. I won't spoil the book, but it's akin to what many espouse here on this forum: reading the last line, then read the first line, then skim the answer choices, and finally read the full vignette. **The value of the book lies in this: reflect on how your approach differs from the book and ask yourself, ""Why""?**

For instance, before reading the book my standard test taking procedure was read the last line and first line, in that order, and never read the answer choices. My prior rationale was I didn't want to be 'tricked' by any of the answer choices, and needed to formulate my own answer before looking at the answer choices. **Here I found that around \~40% of the time, the answer I had in my mind wasn't among the answer choices.** As a result, I ended up having to re-read the question (\~2-2.5 times) after reviewing the answer choices. **This time sink ultimately contributed to time pressure towards the end of blocks, making me somewhat rushed (though finishing a block was never a problem for me).** Reading the answer choices did lead me down some anchoring bias problems, but it significantly reduced the cognitive load of trying to formulate a diagnosis first before the choices, and this change in test taking behavior alone allowed me to go from having \~ 1-2 min left over for each block to \~10-15 minutes left over.

**3. Triage questions judiciously (biostats / drug ads / multi-parts for last).**

I had heard this before: do the easy questions first and save the hardest for last. Or, questions of different difficulties deserve proportional attention. In high stakes exams however I found this difficult to actuate: I tried skimming thru and solving the shortest vignettes first, but just clicking back and forth, as well as keeping track which ones I skiped, ended up wasting a lot of time for me. There is something that worked for me: (1) I always saved the multi-part questions for last, because I didn't want the feedback of getting the first question wrong to dent my confidence until the very end and (2) I always saved the biostats / drug ad questions for last. I found those classes of problems are almost always reading comprehension based and not reflective of clinical acumen, and so I left myself with more time to solve them rather than pacing \~90 seconds for each qustion.

4. **Hiring a tutor**

**This was something I mulled over a lot...** there's a lot of STEP2 tutoring companies out there and it's quite expensive. I didn't have anyone around me who used them, so I worried about its true value and impact. At the end, I considered how much this score meant to me, and in the grand scheme of things, the cost of this investment was outweighed by future earnings. I considered standard tutoring companies like Elite Medical Prep, Select Med Tutors, etc, and did some trial sessions with them. On the whole I had a pretty good experience as my tutor didn't just explain questions to me - they were able to identify **high level gaps in my test taking behavior** that influenced my probability of getting every question right. It's not my place to say anything negative against something I didn't try but Yousmle is kind of strange - I was attracted to them via their YouTube channel that similarly focused on high level test taking behavior tips, but when I reached out it turns out for thousands of dollars they provide a 15 min consultation with the main tutor (Dr. Palmerton) but the rest of the money is spent accessing their NBME-fine tuned ChatGPT (?!). No thanks, I'll consider paid ChatGPT before them. Tl;dr: **tutoring definitely helped for the** ***coaching*** **- I got to step into the shoes of an experienced test taker, identify things I have been doing that I didn't realize had been hurting me, and if nothing else was great for morale.** My mentor definitely helped me stay focused and grounded, believing that progress is made incrementally and slowly, reassuring me that my score improvement will come. **Whether tutoring would have been more helpful throughout clerkships vs multi-sessions during dedicated - I leave that up to you.** I only did it during dedicated and certainly benefited - might have improved my score by \~5 points.

**5. Cross reference your highlighting behavior with someone else (ideally someone who is a better test taker than you).**

I can only speak for myself: I had some weird highlighting habits. Initially I was just highlighting out of passivity, guiding my mouse across as I carefully read line by line. When I was advised to change my highlighting behavior (what's the point of highlighting if you highlight everything?) I found that I was highlighting the exact ""inverse"" of what I was highlighting. For instance I'd highlight the begnning of the PEx, or bookmark where the key history began, but the key details were left unhighlighted. You might be screaming out of your chair right now wondering why the hell I would be doing this, but I found my mind 'defaulted' to this behavior in the middle of the test when I got fatigued and fell back onto old habits. **I don't know what the ideal highlighting behavior is, but it should at least allow you to summarize the vignette into a concise one liner. Cross reference with your friends and you might identify differences in your behavior that are clues for potential score improvement.**

**6. Some subjects are over-represented on the exam, including biostats.**

AMBOSS, UWorld, Randy Neil, whatever you may choose to hone your biostats, do it and do it early in the preparation because it's a skill more so than knowledge, so it takes time to improve. At the end I still couldn't get a comfortable grasp on some of the word play they use to confound what they are actually asking for (because, let's admit, we've all memorized the formulas, so how do we make the questions more difficult?). **One thing I will add is that aim to study based on the USMLE Step2 CK content outline.** For this, I refer you to Dr. Basunia's biostats playlist. He has an accompanying PDF that I used to review **everything the USMLE Step2CK expects us to know about biostats.** Things like DALY/QALY or Mann-Whitney test - they've shown up on the NBME but didn't show up in any of the AMBOSS biostats questions. But they are on Dr. Basunia's PDF, and can corroroborate that he went off the official content outline, so I felt pretty confident it's complete and comprehensive. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejj0EngKrnI&list=PLRH\_JjB9jT4n-bZZlMZaTCKfs17KaGgud&ab\_channel=AzfarBasunia%2CMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejj0EngKrnI&list=PLRH_JjB9jT4n-bZZlMZaTCKfs17KaGgud&ab_channel=AzfarBasunia%2CMD)

7. **Sleep optimization**

**We have to count on being able to sleep to (1) remember what we learned yesterday (2) solidify memories and (3) work hard the next day.** If you have insomnia, **consider going to see a psychiatrist - you might be surprised that even though you know all about SIG-E-CAPS there may be an underlying picture of depression. This is a sensitive subject but I want to tell you, from the bottom of my heart, take care of yourself first. I was midway through a rotation when I was telling a classmate about my symptoms at home before he and I both realized I'm depressed... It can hit anyone, anytime, and especially during dedicated.** Get yourself checked out.

8. **The exam is a test of knowledge anyone outside of medicine might expect us to know about.**

Environmental exposures during home improvement. Being hit by a baseball to the eye. Yes, we study the berrylliosis and the penetrating abdominal traumas, but there will and honestly should be more scenarios than we are expected 'to know'. I once griped about why the hell anyone needs to know all the vitamins by name, but I kid you not in OBGYN a patient who had immigrated from halfway across the globe wanted me to **make sure every vitamin in their pre-natal vitamin they received in their home country was up-to-date with American standards.** I do believe the questions make use better doctors, and I actually have learned a lot from the NBME/actual test day. this shift in mindset from ""Good grief how the hell am I supposed to know this"" to ""Yeah OK this is weird but I still know a lot, I might be able to help..."" is I think something I attribute to test taking and probably makes me a better doctor (only time will tell).

**9. All of the test-day micro-optimizations you can do:**

\- Schedule to take the Free 120 at the Prometric. Familiarizing yourself with the test taking environment has been proven to improve test scores.

\- During your exam, open up the lab values ALWAYS, as this squeezes the text into half the screen. Your eyes spend less time darting left to right, reducing eye strain. I found this helpful.

\- Consider doing an NBME + Old Free 120 to simulate what it feels like 320 questions (2 more than what you'll do on test day). I found I crashed in the middle and decided to start eating much earlier on test day - this definitely helped.

\- **Coffee beans are NOT an ideal tool for caffeine induction lol.** There's a potent laxative in coffee beans that makes you possibly incontinent. Try caffeine gum, or caffeine lozenges. On this note...

\- **Consider bringing an entire bag of cough drops** to the test site to share with other test takers. Trust me, if not for yourself, taking out the coughs from other people will help your concentration. I wrote about this in a different post.

\- There are a number of items you can bring into the Prometric that will greatly improve your ergonomics / test taking comfort. Review them here: [https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/test-accommodations](https://www.usmle.org/what-to-know/test-accommodations)

\- It's easier to rule into an answer but much harder to rule out of it. Consider this when you are between two options.

\- Remind yourself that there's no way you can learn / recall / know everything, and admit there will be things you won't have seen on test day. While you might not know the answer, you can still **solve** the problem. Use your knowledge to rule out answers, and choose the answer left over (but use this sparingly).

Only a week approaching the exam / the days after did I understand this Reddit - as much as it is cluttered with garbage and LARPing and people scoring 280s getting a 279 asking if they should delay their exam - it is also a refuge, a place to seek reassurance, build rapport... it's hard to explain but I knew this, all of this, many months before when I started doomscrolling but the lived experience of not knowing how I did has made me **feel what others are going through**. If nothing else, this is out of solidarity. Fight the good fight, do the best you can, and be kind to yourself and others.

Lately I’ve been getting a weird bitter taste in my mouth, especially when eating things like chicken or coffee.

Even some veggies and drinks start tasting off, but oddly, some foods like plain rice cakes or pork don’t trigger it at all.

I do have MCAS, SIBO, and sulfur sensitivity, and I’ve noticed this started around the time I increased sodium cromoglycate (SCG). I’ve also been taking zinc and B1, and dealing with a cold, which might be relevant. Could this be some kind of MCAS mouth reaction, bile reflux, or salivary gland inflammation?

One of these business is US based (where the owner is) and, including me, we're a team of just 4 people. Coincidently, 3 of 4 of us will be in Spain for the summer and the owner really wants us to all finally meet in person, so they have decided to fly out at the end of July and we'll all meet in Barcelona.

The owner be in town for 4-5 days and we'll have 3 true ""work"" days together (Wed-Fri) and plan to do some coworking, but also eat meals out together and maybe do a little bit of sight-seeing. More on the 4 of us and our vibes below, if helpful making recommendations!

**COWORKING SPACE**  
There are a TON of coworking options in a city like Barcelona (I'm overwhelmed) - can anyone recommend one where we might be able to rent a small meeting space/office for all 4 of us to work and collaborate?

**ACCOMODATIONS**  
Similarly, figuring out where to stay for 4 people somewhat short notice is... interesting! We're open to a 4-bedroom apartment or individual hotel rooms. The few apartments I can find are in the €1600-€2800 range (assuming 4-5 nights. Is it even possible to find a hotel option for 3-4 individual rooms that can compete with this pricing or stay under 4000? Or is there a hybrid coliving/coworking that maybe I just haven't discovered yet? 

**More about us + other requirements:**

* 2 of 4 are fluent Spanish speakers
* Age group: 30-45 - Youthful, trendy, modern vibes, but not edgy
* We like authentic/local vibes, but 1 person is not well-traveled so possibly will feel more comfortable if not totally off the beaten track
* I've stayed in Poble-Sec myself and also heard good things about Poblenou for neighborhoods... leaning toward these for accommodations and coworking, but open-minded!
* Any recommendations must be accessible by metro or otherwise within walking distance so staying somewhat near the city center
* Mate lovers, coffee drinkers, intro coffee/cafe culture and big foodies... we can't wait to eat together!

I’ll show you how to keep things simple, clear, and effective—without sounding like a robot or triggering the spam filter. You’ll get examples, tips, and some do’s and don’ts I’ve learned the hard way.

Let’s jump in.

# Why Email Still Works (Better Than Social Media)

Before we get into the “how,” here’s a quick stat to give you some perspective:  
According to [**Litmus**, email marketing has an average ROI of **$36 for every $1 spent**.](http://litmus.com/) That’s better than most paid ads and way better than the average social post.

[Social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/) is noisy and fast-moving. Emails land in inboxes, where people are already in a mindset to read.

When someone signs up to your list, they’ve *given* you permission to show up in their inbox. That’s huge.

If you’re doing [affiliate marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-affiliate-marketing-business-and-make-money/), this is where the real leverage is.

# Step 1: Know Who You’re Talking To

This is where a lot of people go wrong. You can’t just send the same email to *everyone*. People want to feel like you’re talking to *them*, not blasting out a pitch to 10,000 random subscribers.

Here’s what to figure out first:

* Who are you helping?
* What problem are they trying to solve?
* Why would they actually *want* to hear from you?

Write like you’re talking to a single person—not a crowd. One simple tip that helps: Imagine you’re writing to a close friend who asked for advice on something you actually use and love.

# Step 2: Lead With Value First

Don’t jump straight into selling. That’s the fastest way to get ignored or marked as spam.

Instead, lead with something useful:

* A quick tip
* A short personal story
* A question that gets your reader thinking

Then—and only then—bring up the affiliate product as a way to solve the problem or make things easier. The more helpful you are, the more likely people are to trust your recommendation.

# Example:

Subject: Struggling to focus in the afternoon?

I used to hit a wall around 3 PM every day—until I started using this simple habit (and no, it’s not more coffee).

Here’s what helped: \[your helpful tip here\]

And if you want a shortcut, this tool made a big difference for me: \[affiliate link\]

You’re helping *first*. That’s what builds trust.

# Step 3: Keep It Short, But Clear

Your email doesn’t need to be long. Short emails often perform better.

Here’s what to include:

* A subject line that grabs attention
* A quick hook in the first sentence
* Some helpful content or insight
* A soft recommendation with your affiliate link
* A simple call to action (like “Check it out here”)

**Avoid:**  
 Over-explaining  
 Including five different links  
 Using complicated words or sounding like a copywriter robot

**Instead, aim for:**  
 Clarity  
 Simplicity  
 Relevance

# Step 4: Make Your Affiliate Link Feel Natural

You don’t need to *hide* your affiliate link. But it should fit naturally in the email.

For example, instead of saying:

>

Say something like:

FEATURED

>

Better, right?

Also, **disclose that it’s an affiliate link.** You don’t have to overdo it—just a simple note like:

>

It builds trust and keeps things transparent.

# Step 5: Test, Adjust, Repeat

Affiliate email [marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) isn’t a one-and-done game. Some emails will perform great, others won’t. That’s normal.

Try changing:

* Subject lines
* The length of the email
* Where you place your link
* Your tone (more casual or more direct)

Pay attention to your **open rates** and **click-through rates**. If people aren’t clicking, your emails might need more clarity or stronger value up front.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Let’s go through a few quick no-no’s:

# Writing one email and never following up

Most sales happen after a few touches. Plan for a short series (2–3 emails), not just one.

# Overhyping the product

Don’t promise things the product can’t deliver. That’s how you lose trust fast.

# Skipping the story

People connect with *you*, not just your links. Share little wins, struggles, or why the product helped you personally.

# Bonus: Follow-Up Email Example

Let’s say you sent a first email about a tool you recommend. Here’s a simple follow-up you could send a day or two later:

**Subject**: Forgot to mention this yesterday

Just realized I left out something kind of important in my last email.

The tool I shared also helps with \[another benefit\]—which I didn’t even realize until I started using it more.

If you’re still curious, here’s that link again: \[affiliate link\]

Let me know what you think if you try it!

That kind of follow-up feels natural, helpful, and low-pressure.

# FAQs

**1. Can I use** [**ChatGPT**](https://tchelete.com/how-to-make-money-online-with-chatgpt/) **to write affiliate emails?**

Yes—just be sure to personalize the output. Add your voice, tweak the tone, and include real experiences when you can.

**2. How many links should I include?**  
One to two is usually enough. Too many links can feel spammy and confuse the reader.

**3. What’s a good subject line for affiliate emails?**  
Keep it short and curiosity-driven. For example:

* “This solved a problem I didn’t know I had”
* “What actually helped me focus (not more coffee)”
* “You might like this too”

**4. Do I need to use an email** [**marketing**](https://tchelete.com/how-to-become-a-digital-marketer/) **platform?**  
Definitely. Tools like [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/), [MailerLite](https://www.mailerlite.com/), or [Systeme.io](http://Systeme.io) make it easier to manage lists, set up automations, and track clicks.

**5. How often should I email my list?**  
Start with once a week. As you get more confident, you can experiment with 2–3 times per week, especially when you’re running a campaign.

# Final Thoughts

Writing emails for [affiliate marketing](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-an-affiliate-marketing-business-and-make-money/) isn’t about being slick or salesy. It’s about helping someone solve a problem—and suggesting something that works. If you lead with value, keep things clear, and write like a real human, people will listen.

Here’s the big question to leave you with:

**If someone read your email today, would they feel like you helped them—or just tried to sell them something?**",1,1750971704.0,makemoneyonlineng,0,1.0,False
1llbj5j,https://youtu.be/8IMPg1bXbMY,Here’s what happened in this week’s Dev AMA: 6-26-25,"Here’s what happened in this week’s AMA:

🎯 LeetLotto Updates

Post-launch refinements included entry tracking, fast-draw indicators for lottos under 0.1 BNB, and a fireworks icon for featured lottos of 1 BNB or more.

These updates showcase a new, modern icon system that will gradually expand across the entire GMR platform.

The LeetLotto section of the whitepaper has been fully rewritten to highlight transparency, Chainlink VRF integration, and use of The Graph protocol.

📈 Socials and Marketing

Reddit and Twitter performance remains strong, though last week’s missed recap post may have affected engagement.

Meme of the Week saw very low participation. It’s being given one more push before potentially being retired.

A large email campaign promoting LeetLotto is going out to 25,000 to 26,000 users this weekend.

A new community event, Coffee Morning, is planned for next Saturday.

📹 Stream Client Progress

A fully featured OBS-based stream client is being developed. Originally planned as a lightweight wrapper, it’s now expanding to rival Streamlabs in functionality.

Users will log in with their GMR Center account, connect platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Kick, and stream without manual stream key setup.

The new target is to have it finished by Wednesday, in time to discuss and nominate a new dev focus in Thursday’s Dev Chat.

Future features may include token-gated tools to reward GMR holders.

🎮 Game Development

A call with the Battle Leet dev team is scheduled. Updates will be shared next week.

Steam listing is being reviewed, pending clarity around their crypto policy. Web3 functions are kept outside the game client to maintain compatibility.

Epic Store wishlist is already live.

🧰 Platform Improvements

A major timeline overhaul is underway, shifting toward a cleaner Twitter-like feed with support for reposts, clearer separation from profiles, and improved replies.

The chat system used in lotto pages will serve as the foundation for the new lightweight social layer.

Ticket prices will soon be visible directly on the main lotto page, thanks to community feedback.

🧪 Additional Notes

A custom authentication system is being tested in LeetClicker and will eventually replace third-party auth across the GMR ecosystem.

A known iOS token storage issue affecting Telegram mini apps is under investigation.

CertiK audits were discussed. GMR V3 uses OpenZeppelin contracts, which are already widely audited and trusted.

🗓 Looking Ahead

Stream client is targeted for completion by Wednesday.

Email campaigns, whitepaper promotions, and community events are active.

Development focus remains on the new timeline and refining social features.

Thanks again to everyone who participated. More great progress is coming in the weeks ahead. See you at the next Dev Chat!

1llbgk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cjmackiv/comments/1llbgk4/3_week_italy_trip_report_april_may_2025/,3 Week Italy Trip Report  April - May 2025,"This board was of tremendous help to my wife and I as we planned what ended up being a 3 week trip across Italy. From Rome to Tuscany, to Florence, to Venice. So I hope to repay the favor in some small way with my trip report. I've focused on our lodging, attractions and dining choices and tried to rate each appropriately. Happy to answer any questions if needed. Here we go.

ITALY 3 WEEK TRIP REPORT

We flew into Rome on the Wednesday before Easter, and spent a week there.  Took the train up to Chiusi where we rented a car and went on to Cortona for another week.  Day tripped to Sienna, Montepulciano and Montalcino while there.  Took a cooking class.  Then train on to Florence for 5 days.  Finally, train to Venice for 3 days before heading home.  Here are my quick thoughts on lodging, restaurants and attractions that we visited.  All rankings out of 10.

ROME

Hotel

**Antica Dimora delle Cinque Lune** \- 6.5 - Great location, clean but dark and cramped room.  3rd floor room overlooked the street and was noisy in the evening.  Didnt spend much time there, so it was fine.

Attractions

**The Colosseum** \- 10 - Amazing!  Just awestruck that this is still standing.  The scale and design are incredible.  Only downside was we paid for a tour of the entire site including the underground, but were denied entry to the underground because JD Vance and family were supposedly there.

**The Vatican** \- 8 - Just so much to see.  So much art, it was fatiguing.  4 hour tour on Good Friday was a lot.  Crowds were terrible.  But we knew that going in.  Hot take? Sistine Chapel as an experience was just meh.  Wouldnt make my top ten of things we saw.  St Peter’s?  They didnt know when to stop.  Too much.

**Borghese Gallery** \- 8 - Wonderful sculptures, audio tour was perfect.

**The Pantheon** \- 9 - Scale, design and age are all awe inspiring.  A quick tour, 20 minutes was perfect.

**The city overall** \- 8 - wonderful despite crowds.  Wandering around, visiting incredibly ornate churches was amazing.

Restaurants

**La Matricianella** \- 7 - Old skool italian, intimidating wine list.  Got a tour of the impressive cellar.  Food was solid, nothing spectacular.  Grappa to close the evening was fantastic but probably a mistake. 😂

**Seu Pizza Illuminati** \- 6.5 - Top 50 pizza place in the world.  Too experimental for me.  Crust was great, but overall flavor combinations were not there.

**Ristorante Pinseria Da Massi** \- 8 - Neighborhood spot with friendly service.  Lots of families and older couples.  Food was very good.  I tried the Ossobuco alla Romana, which I’d never had before and was delicious!

**Gregory’s Jazz Club** \- 9 - rating for vibe, setting and music.  Food was nothing special.

**Vitti Osteria & Cantina** \- 4 - Bad food. No other way to put it.  Just bad. If I didnt know I was in Rome, I would’ve believed the food came directly off the Sysco delivery truck.  I trusted reviews on The Fork for this one.  Never again.

**Osteria del Sostegno** \- 10 - Tucked away down an alley.  Looking for simple lunch, we grabbed an outside table in the alleyway.  We split a salad and cacio e pepe.  OMG, they were both amazing.  House white was perfect.  Tried to go back for dinner, but they weren’t open our last night in Rome.  Best C&P I had the entire trip. Still dream about that pasta.

**Antico Forno Roscioli** \- 10 - Tiny place, just get in line with the crowd.  But thankfully it moved fast.  When we got up front we were unsure how to order, as pizzas were whole and they we just hacking off chunks,  So we pointed and made hand gestures to indicate how much. And it worked just fine.   Asked for a birra ala spina and left the glass on the shelf out front. Stood just outside eating amazing pizza.  Love that crust!

**All'Antico Vinaio**  \-  10 -  Yes, overhyped and crowded.  But honestly this was another very fast line and the sandwich lived up the hype.  Il’ Paradiso sandwich with mortadella, straciatella and pistachio cream.  Let me tell you, that pistachio cream is no joke.  Could’ve ate this for lunch every day we were in Rome.

**Pinsitaly Trevi** \-  8 - Casual lunch spot, great sandwiches.

CORTONA

Lodging

**Cortona Skyline Retreat** [https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/cortona-skyline-retreat.html#tab-main](https://www.booking.com/hotel/it/cortona-skyline-retreat.html#tab-main) \- 9 - Clean, modern and roomy.  Was a perfect base for our stay in Tuscany.  Allesandro and Federico were terrific hosts.  Beds were comfy and the terrace was great for sunsets and happy hours.

Attractions

**Argiano Winery** \- 10 - Amazing wines, a fantastic tour and tasting.  Wines arent cheap but definitely best we had.

**Poggio Sorbello winery** \- 10 - We had a tour, tasting and lunch at their gazebo.  Wonderful friendly staff, great wines, and tasty food.  

**De’Ricci winery** \- 8  - Tour was fun, though a bit campy.  You could tell our guide had delivered these lines hundreds of times before.  Wine tasting was surprisingly good.  Very enjoyable.

**La Braccesca** \- 7 - Beautifully designed, large tasting room.  Pretty good wines.  Overpriced tour and tasting.  And the only place we went to that didnt comp the tasting fee with our wine purchase.

**Montepulciano, Montalcino, Sienna day trips** \- 9 - Each town was unique, and we had a great time at each location.  Definitely worth the drive.

**Cortona** \- 10 - Just a delightful little town, though everywhere you walked seemed uphill!  Wonderful little sidewalk cafes for happy hour.  Didn’t seem crowded with tourists.  And the group of old men who sit on the church steps every evening at the same time, watching and commenting on the passersby were hilarious to watch.

Restaurants

**Trattoria Dardano** \- 8.5 - Charming little restaurant.

**Sartu** \- 9 - Innovative and delightful cuisine. The gentlemen who serviced all tables was so attentive and helpful.

**La Bucaccia Da Romano** \- 9 - Everything was amazing.  Great wine by the glass.  Lovely setting.

**Ristorante La Loggetta** \- 10 - Our best meal of our stay in Cortona.  Everything was delicious.  And again, a fabulous grappa to close the evening.

**Osteria del Teatro** \- 10 - Stopped here for a lunch after we hiked to the Convent de Celle.  Lasagna special was incredible.  And outdoor seating was just perfect.

**Osteria Del Conte Montepulciano** \- 10 - Stopped here for lunch after exploring Montepulciano.  Just a delightful spot.  Swordfish carpaccio was a big hit.  But everything we had was wonderful  Mixed seafood special was great.

**Tigella Emilia** \- 9 - Casual spot on one of the many side streets in Siena.  Husband and wife team. She makes the pasta every morning, he’s out front. Not much for ambience, but we had a delicious, simple lunch here.

FLORENCE

Lodging

**B&B Florence Cathedral -** 6 - The smallest and most cramped of all the places we stayed.   Only place I regretted booking.  We’ve stayed in many tiny rooms that were designed well, with spaces for your luggage, where things make sense and daily living can still be comfortable.  That wasnt here.  But, big marks for location.  Just a couple blocks off the Piazza del Duomo.  While the room was bad, the overall experience was amazing.  Stayed close to Central Florence all week.  Just wandered to breakfast spots, sidewalk trattorias for lunch and the best was happy hour around the piazza.  Yes packed with tourists.  But you’re sitting at an outdoor table with amazing weather, maybe a sweater to throw on as the sun goes down, drinking wine or an aperol spritz, and enjoying the view, and the street life discussing the day and dinner plans.  I mean, nothing better.  Loved our little coffee shop just across the street, and the woman who opened in the morning.  She quickly got used to the site of me as she opened the roller door to her cafe, and would just nod in recognition of my usual order, as a sign that I could continue my walk and stop back to pick up the hot coffees and an almond croissant.  She seemed genuinely disappointed when I told her of our departure on our last morning.

Attractions

**Santa Maria del Fiore** \- 8 - We did a 30 minute skip the line express tour and it was great.  We got the highlights and were able to spend some time on our own exploring the church.  Scale was impressive.

**Secret Food Tour** \- 10 - We enjoyed this morning tour a lot.  The guide was friendly and knowledgeable, and the food samples we tried were great.  I’m a new fan of the lampredotto!

**Galleria dell’Accademia di Firenze and Michaelangelo’s David** \- 10 - Probably my favorite of all the museums/galleries we saw in Italy.  David and it’s placement in the galleria is simply perfect.  We spent a good amount of time here, despite the crowds.

**Uffizi Gallery** \- 8 - Researching guided tours for this site, I discovered Rick Steves downloadable audio tours.  And it was perfect for this location.  It helped us move through the crowds to see the best sites.  The tour was easy to follow and the pace was perfect.  I appreciated the variety of art here.

**Ponte Vecchio** \- 5 - Ugh.  I guess you have to see it, but the crowds were oppressive.

**Boboli Gardens** \- 9 - Great break from the crowds.  Beautiful gardens 

Restaurants

**Cibreo Cafe** \- 8 - Fascinating people watching!  Seems to be very popular among the young studying abroad crowd obliviously spending daddy’s money.  Food was good, but nothing special.  Service was poor.

**Cantinetta Antinori** \- 9 - Fantastic food, wonderful wine list.  Started with a flight of Tuscan whites, all were great.  Ossobucco was outstanding.  Only disappointment was service was very cold.

**Gusta Pizza** \- 10 - I know Florence is not the place for neapolitan pizza.  But it was what we wanted and Gusta did not disappoint.  Just delicious.

**Coquinarius** \- 9 - A charming little bistro with great food.  The swordfish carpaccio and the cheese and pear ravioli were standouts.

VENICE

Lodging

**Residenza San Marco “La Padrona”** \- 8 - Very nice room in a great location.  Only downside was the AC.  It was pretty warm in Venice and the AC wasnt working well.  They brought in a repairman the first day we were there, and supposedly fixed it.  But it still barely made a dent in the heat.  Fortunately, our neighborhood was quiet and it was cool enough with the windows open.

Attractions

**Gondola Tour** \- 4 - Literally every thing I read and everyone I talked to, advised us not to bother with a gondola tour.  Expensive, crowded and unimpressive was the word.  Well, they were right.  The wife wanted this and she usually gets what she wants.  So booked a 30 minute semi-private gondola with a serenade. Ride was only 21 minutes long. The gondolier was on his cell phone the entire time and was perturbed when we asked questions. So we had no idea what we saw or where we were.  We were supposed to receive a “romantic serenade” on our ride. But the accordionist/singer was on another boat. And we were told last minute that the boats would be side by side, so that we could enjoy the music. Most of the time the boat with the music trailed well behind, often by 20 or 30 yards. We couldn’t hear the music and the experience was definitely not romantic. Very disappointing.

**St Marks and Doge’s Palace** \- 8 - Doge’s Palace was our favorite.  The rooms and paintings were really gorgeous.  The prison and Bridge of Sighs were fascinating.  We were on our own, no audio guide.  But we had no trouble following the signage and understanding what we were seeing.  St Mark’s was impressive, but we preferred Doge.  

**Murano & Burano Day Trip** \- 9 - Maybe our favorite thing we did in Venice.  It was a cool and overcast day but we really enjoyed our entire experience.  We went to a glass blowing demonstration in Murano that was really fascinating, and despite warnings, we were never hounded to buy glass.  We did but a couple of small things to take home.  When we got to Burano, the clouds cleared and the colorful buildings were quite beautiful.  

Restaurants

**Antico Dolo** \- 9 - Charming little place.  We were welcomed by the friendly third generation owner and enjoyed our dinner immensely.  The grilled calamari with parsley sauce and the tiramisu ala minute were stars.

**Ostaria Boccadoro** \- 10 - Another charming little bistro.  We made it here despite the long walk from our apartment in the middle of a rainstorm, and were glad we did.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Me having order fatigue, we put ourselves in the hands of our waiter and he didnt steer us wrong.  A grilled seafood appetizer and crab salad were outstanding.  Then we split the pasta special that was just as good.  A grappa and a chocolate mousse were the perfect ending.  The rains had stopped and we had a very pleasant walk back.  Highly recommend.

**El Magazen** \- 10 - on our second day in Venice we stumbled across a little restaurant and stopped for lunch.  The food, the wine, the setting, the service were all spectacular.  Probably our best meal of the entire trip.  A true mom and pop operation with the husband a frenchman out front and his wife, of Indian descent, in the kitchen.  The melding of the cuisines and flavors was magical.  And the wine by the glass available, all recommended by the husband were outstanding.  My spaghetti in chili and garlic oil with breadcrumbs and marinated mackerel was unlike any pasta I have had before.  My wife had the sea bass, and it was fantastic too.  Before we left lunch, we made a reservation for the next night.  ",1,1750971429.0,u_cjmackiv,0,1.0,False
1llbg8k,https://i.redd.it/czzxewnl1c9f1.png,Chances and Advice? June 10th Test Results,"Hi everyone. I just got my DAT score back yesterday and wanted to get some honest feedback and advice. I took the exam on July 10.

I have a 3.6 cumulative GPA (have not calculated my science gpa but let's say most definitely less than 3.6). I have completed 200+ hours shadowing and lightly assisting at a dental office. In addition, my recent extracurricular include volunteering for over 200 hours at a hospital and another 200+ hours at a local food pantry. I also tutored high school students for the SAT for like 2-3 months and took part in the Heart Walk with the American Heart Association for a day but these were done a lot more time ago like freshman year.

I have not done any research and I was just a member of the pre-dental club (no special roles). I don't think I have anything that screams ""leadership' as well. I did worked during undergrad like a couple of years at two different medical offices (front desk and minor assisting duties) and a couple years at a coffee shop.

These are the extracurriculars I was able to come up with currently at the top of my head. I feel like I have nothing that stands out or anything unique about me and feel like a ""cookie cutter"" 😞.

I am planning to apply to all the New York dental schools plus a few nearby out of state ones like Rutgers and Temple. 

I would really appreciate any advice moving forward. Thank you!",4,1750971410.0,predental,9,1.0,False
1llbf9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DopamineDetoxing/comments/1llbf9c/desperate_for_7_days_dopamine_detox/,Desperate for 7 days dopamine detox,"Hey folks,

I’m in a really bad place with my productivity right now, and I feel like I’m on the edge of losing control over my routine. I smoke, drink way too much coffee, and spend hours scrolling through news websites. These are the three main ways I procrastinate — and honestly, they’ve taken over my workday.

Here’s how it usually goes: I sit at my desk, open my laptop, and tell myself I’ll start working. But instead, I light a cigarette, make a huge cup of coffee, and before I know it, I’ve spent two or three hours reading news articles I don’t even care about. I feel drained, guilty, and completely stuck. I barely get anything done, and I know my performance is slipping. I'm genuinely afraid this could get me a warning or even cost me my job.

What’s frustrating is that I’m not lazy in every aspect of life — I actually work out every single day, 7 days a week. I’m consistent with physical activity, but when it comes to sitting down and doing focused work, I fall apart.

I just found this group, and in a desperate attempt to break the cycle, I’m turning to you for help. I’ve seen a lot of talk here about dopamine detox, and I believe it could help me reset. I even asked ChatGPT to generate a 7-day plan, but it gave me vague and overly complicated ideas that didn’t feel doable.

So I’m asking:
Could anyone here suggest or create a realistic and simple 7-day dopamine detox plan I can actually follow?
Something that takes into account my bad habits and helps me get through the first days of withdrawal and resistance?

I’d deeply appreciate any advice or structure you can share.

1llbele,https://www.reddit.com/r/CHERUB/comments/1llbele/merci_pour_laccueil/,MERCI pour l'accueil.,"As a small gift for the warm welcome, I'm sending you an excerpt from chapter 27 translated into English, which I haven’t published yet because I still have to write chapters 15 to 26.

CH27 

Lauren was walking down the street when, just a few meters ahead, she recognized Mrs. Levasseur, alone, tears in her eyes, staring at the crater left by the bombing. The journalists had been gone for several hours; only two police officers remained, patrolling around the site.

Lauren quickly turned her head toward a shop window and hurried to pull her hood further down over her face. She watched Mrs. Levasseur through the reflection in the bookstore’s window, crying over the spot where her two children had died. Lauren couldn’t go over to comfort her without risking blowing her cover. That’s when her eyes landed on a magazine cover featuring the French actor Louis de Funès—and an idea came to her.

Lauren pulled out her phone and called Antoine.

— ""Yeah?""

— ""Are you still at Fnac?""

— ""Yeah, why?""

— ""Can you come meet me…""

Her eyes landed on the glowing Starbucks sign.

— ""At the Starbucks on Fossés de Saint-Julien. Right now, please? I need a huge favor.""

— ""Okay, I’m coming.""

Lauren walked into the bookstore, bought a gardening magazine, and then settled at a window seat in Starbucks, coffee in hand, keeping her eyes fixed on Mrs. Levasseur, who was still standing motionless, staring at the crater.

Antoine arrived two minutes later and sat next to Lauren.

— ""So, what’s this favor?""

— ""Do you see that woman in the long beige coat looking at the crater, standing completely still?""

— ""Yeah?""

— ""I know her. And I knew her children, Thomas and Valérie—they were my friends during my mission in Rouen. They died here during the attack. I can’t speak to her without risking blowing my cover. And if I do, I get kicked out of CHERUB. But you—she doesn’t know you. You’re good at improvising, and you’re a great actor.""

— ""Alright… so what do I do?""

— ""Go talk to her. Her name’s Julie. Pretend to recognize her. Say you briefly met her at Valérie’s birthday. Pretend you were one of her children’s friends

—and my brother. Improvise. But please, comfort her. I can’t do it myself.""

— ""And you?""

— ""I’ll stay here, watching from behind my magazine. Activate one of your mics so I can listen in.""

Antoine closed his eyes for a moment to focus, then took a deep breath.

— ""Okay, I’m going. Wish me luck.""

He left the café as Lauren put in an earpiece and settled more comfortably in her seat.

Antoine took a wide, discreet detour down the street, activated his mic, walked to the same side of the sidewalk as Mrs. Levasseur, and approached her. He glanced briefly at her face as he passed, then turned back hesitantly.

— ""Um… excuse me? Are you Mrs. Levasseur?""

The mother turned toward him with a slight start.

The waiter brought the second coffee Lauren had ordered, and she paid without leaving her seat.

— ""Yes… that’s me… who are you?""

— ""Olivier, Lauren’s brother. We met at Valérie’s birthday.""

— ""Oh? I’m sorry… I don’t remember you.""

— ""Sure you do… You took my coat, offered me wine twice, which I turned down because I was driving, and I had to leave earlier than expected.""

Mrs. Levasseur shrugged.

Lauren turned a page in her magazine, peeking over the top, listening intently through her earpiece.

— ""That’s quite possible. Lauren did talk about her brother Olivier. You’re a bartender, right?""
Antoine nodded as he gently stepped closer.

— ""Yeah, that’s right. What brings you to Caen?""

Mrs. Levasseur gripped the railing tightly.

— ""I came… to mourn.""

— ""Did you… lose someone?""

— ""Yes. Valérie and Thomas, my two children.""

Antoine paused for a long moment. Tears began to roll down his cheeks.

— ""I’m so sorry… I… I didn’t know… they were at the carnival that day.""

— ""It’s alright, dear. I only have my little girl left. I lost my two children here.""

She looked down, completely lost. Antoine gently laid a hand on her shoulder.

— ""I can’t even imagine what you must be feeling, ma’am.""

She tried to stay composed. Lauren continued to watch them through the Starbucks window, hiding behind her magazine.

— ""How’s Lauren doing? I never got the chance to say goodbye—or thank you. We owe her so much!""

Lauren went pale behind her magazine, realizing she had forgotten to mention a certain detail to Antoine.

— ""What do you mean, owe her?"" Antoine asked, frowning.

— ""She didn’t tell you about the car race to the hospital?""

— ""Unfortunately, ma’am, some stories go in one ear and out the other with me.""

— ""Thanks to her, I’m a grandmother. Valérie was able to have a beautiful, healthy baby.""

— ""I think she did mention something about a delivery.""

Lauren, still observing discreetly, held her breath, nervous. Luckily, she was far enough away, hidden among the café customers. Mrs. Levasseur looked at Antoine with a small smile and then recounted with a hint of gratitude:

— ""Valérie’s water broke in the middle of a picnic, sending everyone into a panic. Thibault, though he had a license, completely lost his cool. So Lauren took the wheel. From the very first meters, to everyone’s shock, she wasn’t a sixteen-year-old anymore—she was a professional driver in a teenager’s body. Every turn, every acceleration, every overtaking move was handled with surgical precision and extraordinary calm. She drove through narrow, winding roads, literally crossed an open field, cutting the trip down from an hour to just thirty minutes, without endangering anyone or attracting police attention. Once there, she skidded to a controlled stop, jumped out of the car like lightning, and with Thibault’s help, got Valérie out and up the hospital steps. Lauren shouted that they needed a doctor immediately, and the hospital staff took over within seconds.""

""Thierry said later that he’d never seen a teenager handle pressure with such control.""

— ""Yes, now that you mention it, I vaguely remember Lauren telling me that. You were really lucky not to crash—or get caught by the police.""

Lauren breathed, relieved.

— ""Yes, thanks to her, Valérie gave birth in the best possible conditions, to a lovely little girl named Laura.""

— ""Laura? That sounds a bit like…""

— ""Lauren? Yes. Valérie and Thibault debated for a long time over a name ending in 'A'. When it came time to fill out the paperwork, they named her Laura as a tribute to Lauren, since that very day, she had suddenly left Rouen because of serious family issues in England.""

Lauren felt a tear run down her cheek as she listened from her hiding spot.

— ""We never got the chance to thank her.""

Antoine checked his watch.
— ""Ma’am, don’t stay here mourning your children. You can’t change the past. Don’t pity the dead—pity the living, those without love or without family. Take care of your little Laura and the rest of your family. Live not in the past, but in the present, and think about the future.""

Mrs. Levasseur kissed Antoine on the cheek, while Lauren smiled, grateful for her teammate.

— ""Quoting half a Dumbledore, huh, Antoine?"" she muttered.

— ""Thank you for your words, young man. You and your sister are good people. I wish you all the best.""

— ""I’ll have to leave you now. Don’t stay here—your little Laura needs you.""

Antoine walked away after giving her a brief hug. He left the street without glancing at the Starbucks, then caught the tram.

Mrs. Levasseur stood a few more minutes in front of the crater, then also walked away.

Lauren received a text from Antoine.

A: So, how did I do?

L: You were brilliant! Great improvisation—what you said about life moving on was beautiful.

A: My turn to say bravo. I had no idea about your high-speed childbirth rescue.

L: Valérie’s water broke. She couldn’t give birth in the middle of nowhere, and I had the skills to get them there fast. I did what I had to, and I managed to convince Zara to make sure the French police didn’t press charges against Thierry, the car’s owner.

L: You deserve a real Oscar for Best Actor! Your tears were so convincing!

A: I was really crying. I put myself in that poor woman’s shoes—even though I don’t know her at all.

L: Next time I see you, I’m giving you a hug!

A: I won’t say no, but I’m not used to hugs… they make me uncomfortable.

L: I don’t care! You did and said everything I wish I could’ve done!

""How come"" I ask.

""Because of the wrong person sees it, then they know we know the thing is broken. And then we are on the hook to fix it. And stop taking so many notes.""

Wtfffff???

It's ok. I'm making a lot of suggestions...so many. But gently. Don't want to make new boss look bad. Because he's really bad at this.

Last player is Sir Farquat the Not Stupid Just Ask Him. You might have to ask him. 

He's a small man like me who gives short guys a bad rap for the syndrome. It's...almost unnerving. Jokes aside fairly sure he has schitzo of some sort... Audio processing issues, paranoia, (told me to watch the two old ladies in accounting because they like to jump on other employees computers and snoop if they aren't careful. I said. ""Wow that's like an insta fire other places .."" he says that's why they are both in front of his office (moved 2 weeks ago) so he can finally catch them in the act after 3 years. I'm waiting for the laugh and the punchline. It never comes.)

Anywho he's not my monkey nor my problem, despite his behavior. I try to avoid best i can. 

Lots of stuff happens. I'm knocking stuff out all over. Boss doesn't speak and shows up to work a little wrinkly. Reminds me of midlife, wife booted you and your holding on by your nails and a fifth of Jack, sleeping in your car. I try to be helpful and stay out of his way. He has no interest in onboarding or showing me anything, because now I know he just doesn't know. It's spooky.

T -2 days. Brutus the backstabber calls me in for a chat. Asks how it is . I say fine. WhiteShaq is quiet. Brut says don't worry Lord is coming in just a few days . I say it's odd that I'm doing this when he's my direct boss and could potentially just fire. Brut looks at me like I'm nuts. ""He's not your manager. You report right to the Lord. The owner.""

WHAT??!!?

The director of IT here, first day, looked me in the face and lied to me. Flat lied. I know because it was one of 4 sentences he spoke that day. Why? It's going to come out...if I wasn't so focused on doing sh*t I'd likely figured it out sooner. What is gained here? Lying usually has a tactical or strategic or emotional reason. It usually serves some purpose. I can't see one. Is it a mistake? Maybe. Man just the weirdness here though

(haven't touched on most of it. Grown women asking to get up and use the rest room. Frantic phone texting under the desk so Farquat doesn't see it, one gal saying she needed pdf editor to ""do the fraud"" then when I chuckle ""wish I was kidding "".....)

Long story ending... WhiteShaq gets wind of the plot. Goes nuts. Farquat pulls me into his office and says he saw me duck into a empty room to use the phone (I did, spouse was losing it. 5 min call) then says you took a 70 min lunch instead of 60 last wed (telehealth, told WhiteShaq. He replied with a thumbs up emoji.) 

Said I was supposed to be to work at 830 and routinely came in at 840. I point out I'm salary. I asked and was told by whiteshaq ""I get here between 730 and 830"" and I said I shoot for 830 and he said he didn't really care just get shit done. Whiteshaq is in the room and rolls his eyes but doesn't deny. They are both ultra mad, near shaking upset. Their voices are almost yelling. I think for a split second if Farquhat tries to put a hand on me I'm absolutely knocking him flat for society and short guys everywhere. Whiteshaqs a problem but I'm hoping long term alcoholism and self hatred have made him slow. Sir Farquat is repeating that ""he's not stupid."" I nearly explain to him most people don't have to say that. Then he says ""you have lost my trust. You are clearly working 2 jobs when..."" 

""Whoooa"" I finally find words. ""Absolutely not. A phone call from my wife and an approved long lunch is not...""

""No no o you see. I'm not stupid."" We establish one more time. It's sadly going to come up again ""Using your phone outside on break. Phone calls...""

Phone call I say. 

I discover he's not stupid again.

""Yeah it's all clear . If I look through your phone what I'm I going to find?""

Now I laugh because Jesus just when I think he's not stupid...

""Oh very little. Because that's never going to happen."" I'm chuckling now because what else is there? He sits back like he just got his MENSA letter.

""See. See Sir Whiteshaq? If he has nothing to hide...?"" 

""Yeah. Take the day. I gotta talk to Lord Jimbo the Absent about what Farquat found."" 

He's done most of the really loud talking. Now big guy looks enraged. Like hands fisting and unfisting mad. ""What did I say when you started?""

I know what he means because it was 5 weeks ago but we speak so rarely. ""Don't embarrass you?"" Whoteshaq , I have no idea....""
.
""DO NOT EMBARRASS ME!!!"" I'm laughing before but now I'm really in ""I might have to fight this huge sad mofo"" mode and it's a little scary. Unexpected in the extreme. I'm an 80s kid who blew up shit with homemade bombs (in my yard) before that got you federal time. I'm feeling a lil strong.

""Take the day. Get out."" Farquat says. 

""I report to Lord"" I say looking at Raging Bull er whiteshaq as I say it. ""Why don't we call him..."" 

""THIS IS MY OFFICE. IM THE OPS MANAGER. IF I WANT OU TO LEAVE""  And that was it. I gotta get out of here I think. Hopefully Lord Absent will square this away, given the conspiracy at play.

I pass Lord brutus and say""dude you heard that. What do I do"" he looks fish belly white and is not confidence inspiring. ""Take the day I'm calling Jimbo the Absent now. We will work this out don't worry ""

Rest of day goes by no contact . I call both Brutus and Absent at 455 and nothing. I go in the next day (because last I heard they said take the day.) right before entering I call Brutus and Absent again. Nothing. I go to the door and whiteshaq is there looking more disheveled than usually. ""Its been discussed and your done here.""

""Can I ask why?""

He doesn't answer and closed the door. 

I blow up Lord Jimbo's phone and he never answers but sends a text saying he's sorry it didn't work out. Contact HR if you have any questions. I call Brutus. Same thing, like a form letter. 

These fuxkig bozos can't even fire someone right because I retain access to a bunch of systems for like days. I didn't sign in, didn't even realize they hadn't been nerfed until I saw some email notices. Deleted all that stuff (I'm a pro) and googled the one person I was super cool with and just asked what the heck is going on do you know? 

She says the rumor is you were gonna replace Whiteshaq and he threatened to quit immediately if you weren't fired. 

I hadnt learned anything from him yet. I'm no use to Brutus the FAILED backstabber or Absent  now...easy choice for them I guess. In fact, I knew this was the only outcome. These guys have been there 20 years, I have zero pull. I didn't expect they would literally make up infractions on the spot...and really dumb ones at that. No paperwork, nobody said anything I did was wrong or even just ""not what we do here "" I didn't ask permission to leave my desk. I got coffee when I needed it. I over communicated what I was working on. No inkling at all anything was wrong. In hindsight I began to notice the weird behavior on little Farquats team...but I was like ""that's his people. Bummer for them. My boss is waaaaay more laid back as long as I'm getting it done."" Jesus weeps.

I'm a pro. I shut down all apps and access that I could without logging into anything and emailed the whole strange group something like

""Jesus you can't even fire people correctly. I was your sysadmin. Here's all the stuff I had access to that you now need to lock me out of:

No pressure. No performance. Just honest conversation among men who are tired of keeping it all in.

I finally found a doctor UROGYNECOLOGIST Keisha Dyer in Winter Park Fl. I was skeptical, i had spent years being told I had e coli, ureaplasma, strep B, BV, yeast etx etc. Antibiotics only worked temporarily until I finally took the time to do every.single.thing my doctor and pelvic floor therapist recommended. Now I'm able to drink coffee, eat the things that triggered me, i can have alcohol and sex pain free. 

Primarily-
Bladder instillations- a cocktail of meds and numbing agents inserted directly into bladder via ureter in urethra. 

Estrogen cream- estrace directly applied to vaginal walls. This helps not just lubrication but the walls thicken as the vagina anus and bladder share these pelvic floor walls. 

Pelvic floor therapy- directly massaging internal vaginal walls wherever they are tense. You do it with a PT or a pelvic floor tool on amazon or your or partners fingers, find the most areas (the ones that feel tender, youll be able to tell) lightly apply pressure avoiding urethra and breathe in and out holding for 10 to 15 sec. I was skeptic but this WORKS. Also, be mindful of how you excercise and where you tense up, many times women with stress or trauma tense up and store that tension in their pelvic bowl. This can be released with external stretches and internal massaging. 

Vaginal moisture- believe it or not this is a huge contributor to UTI like symptoms. If you are dry, you can cause inflamation and discomfort. I improved this with Estrace and :

At my worst I used boric acid suppositories to balancy my pH from all the antibiotic use and baby rash cream for the external vaginal burn, since I couldnt sleep. However, once i uaed these for 5 days I then noticed no yeast or BV but dryness so I switched to using [pH D lubricant gel](https://www.phdfemininehealth.com/products/vaginal-moisturizing-gel-with-hyaluronic-acid?srsltid=AfmBOopJxI_XUvyTEm1OQMopddT2pmZ2206H1OUiwzMJHPJmM7GFFC6G) internally everyother day foe a week and every 3 days thereafter.

[Vagisil probiotic lube libido](https://www.vagisil.com/product/menopause-support-probiotic-lube-libido)

Organic coconut oil- i applied externally and used as lubricant as well my doc recommended. 

hypoallergenic sensitive dove soap to wash always no other soap. 

PRELIEF[prelief](https://a.co/d/9j1mvHF) - this OTC med was precribed to me by my urogyno she said take 2 every day for 2 weeks then as needed, I take it b4 any trigger food like coffee, tomato soup, liquor etc. Works amazing!

Azo bladder[azo bladder pain](https://a.co/d/fhpAPtH) pain and UTI defense- these work wonders as soon as I feel pain they help me ease it immediately and control any sort of snowball effect. I take this as soon as I get any symptom of pain.

I can’t even explain it, it isn’t like a voice or anything that I’m hearing… it’s a feeling inside. Like I can feel His, or a higher beings presence and it’s guiding me. I feel peace when I pray. 

But this is all SO confusing and I feel like I can’t be gay and religious, I don’t really want to attend church every Sunday at this point, I want to have my own relationship and figure things out… but my wife, all of my friends, none of them are religious.

1llaohn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Icelandair/comments/1llaohn/icelandair_review_from_a_newbie_and_first_time/,Icelandair - Review from a newbie and first time trip to Europe,"Wife booked a cruise starting out of Copenhagen and my first question is how are we getting there? Researching flights , reading reviews, and figuring things out is sort of a little hobby of mine so I was very excited to figure out this trip.

  
Initially I searched Google Flights and starting looking at the options. Our home is Kansas City, Missouri so I knew we would need multiple flights to get to Copenhagen. I was a bit discouraged going through Kansas City. Basically Delta and it was expensive. So I decided what if we fly out of NYC which opened up an arrary of international airlines some I've never really had heard of , including Icelandair. It was apparent Icelandair was by far the cheapest option almost half the next option but when I started reading the reviews I wasn't super confident in the airline. I was mainly concerned about delays and missing connections and possbily missing our cruise. I really didn't want to get stuck in iceland because it didn't have a ton of options to Copenhagen from there if I needed to make a change. My goal was to at least get me close to Copenhagen which would allow for train options. Unfortunately the other flights I found at a good price wasn't a Chase partner as I was using points to pay for this flight. So decided to roll the dice with Icelandair and hope for the best. I did end up booking a few days ahead of our cruise to give us extra time incase of travel woes and to spend some extra time in Copenhagen.

I booked with our Chase points I believe it was $1800 for 4 people total for the economy standard fare which got us a checked bag and carry on. Flight was to KEF at 8:25pm with a one hour and 40 minute layover before our final destination to Copenhagen. I had Southwest points that got me from KC to NYC that I used as well. 

We had an 8 hour layover in NYC and had to transfer from Laguardia to JFK. Initially we were going to do something in NYC but the temp forecast was going to be a 102 so we decided to go straight to JFK via an uber and booked a day room at the TWA Hotel - Highly recommend if you need a place to chill and see what travel was like in the 60s. It was easy to find the AirTran and get to Terminal 7. 

JFK Terminal 7 isn't great. Not sure what I was expecting but it didn't help it was 102 degrees that day. So everyone was super cranky. The Icelandair gate was pretty sad and kind of hidden when you first walk into the terminal. There was a modest line of people checking in. We arrived 2 hours and 30 minutes early. Icelandair had plenty of gate agents and the lined moved quickly. Staff was very friendly. They checked our passports , checked our bags. They did make everyone that had a questionable sized carryon and personal bag show that it fit in the box. They didn't care if you had to squish it in the box but it had to fit. There were some folks frustrated with that process trying to bend the rules that they didn't read ahead of time. Whole process probably took 20ish minutes. Security at JFK Terminal 7 that day was awful. There were 3 lines, pre tsa , normal, and priority boarding. Not sure why but all 3 lines just converged into one line before even getting passports and boarding passes checked. It made for a lot of frustration. Being pretsa I'm used to not having to take out my electronics so when my carryon went through it got flagged and I got the TSA person that was having a bad day that just took her sweet time to clear me - made my bag go through 4 times. I stayed cool and just played along. Eventually got through but man had my heart rate going and did I mention it was hot. Had to get to a drink to cool down but again the Terminal is a bit chaotic with so many International flights taking off at the same time and the space is small. I was hoping to sleep on this flight. Had showered and was all relax. Not anymore. Not Icelandairs fault just something to be aware of at JFK Terminal 7. 

Came time for boarding. More chaos at the gate as there is another airline boarding at the sametime next to us. So probably over 500 people in small space, hot and sweaty, from different cultures all trying to figure out what the gate agents where saying which no one could hear. So just random lines are just forming a few people are being agressive trying to push in front of others. We sort of just stayed back and just waited for some sort of organized line to form and it did. On the gate board for Icelandair it did show which rows were boarding. Which they boarded back to front once Saga Premium board first. The same nice people that were at the check in were now at the gate and were all super friendly. 

Our first flight was a 767 with a 2 - 3 - 2 configuration. We had picked our seats in advance and were mid plane. Finding our seats was easy and the staff on the plane again were super welcoming and friendly. I got myself settled and started to notice a bit of a problem. Too many carryon bags were not fitting in the overhead bins and they quickly filled up. Not sure how that happened as I watched the check in folks check carry on sizes. I bit of chaos with people just randomly leaving their carry on in the aisle and walking away hoping someone would figure it out. The staff seemed a little unprepare how to deal with it. Eventually some folks had to check bags to make it work. Even with all the chaos the door shut and looks like we were going to be leaving on time. We start to push off and almost immediately stop. I'm like that can't be good. Did I mention it was hot? Now the air wasn't flowing and it got stuffy quickly. Thank god I always travel with a portable fan It was a life saver. About 15 minutes go by - Captain comes on - Sorry folks looks like we made a mistake in our calcuation and we don't have enough fuel for the flight. I appreciate the transparency but WTH how do you make that kind of mistake? Captain is like we should just be delayed 20 minutes to get a fuel truck to top us off. The staff did let us unbuckle and use the restroom if needed. so about 30 minutes go by I'm looking at the windows I don't see any action going on and panic starts in as pretty much everyone on the flight had a connecting flight.. Another 15 goes by here comes the staff bringing out waters for everyone which was nice gesture but I'm like oh boy we aren't moving for a bit. Captain comes on, so the fuel truck broke down and they are working on bringing another. I'm full panic now on the reality I'm going ot miss my connecting flight. So I start looking at options on my phone and plan for the worst. As I feared very little options and the options that are there are sold out. Start looking at what if I fly to germany etc. I even used the icelandair app to start up a chat with an agent - who was sort of helpful but basically told me nothing they could do until I actually miss my flight. Just about as I was ready to accept our fate, well never been to iceland guess I might have at least a day to go explore. Captain comes in fuel truck is here and we should be good in 5-10 minutes. So believe we were delayed about an hour and 15 minutes total which didn't leave a whole lot of time to deboard, go through immigration, and make it to our gate. I had also planned on us getting to eat at the airport and freshen up. So by the time we are finally airborne. I'm totally stressed out and now have a 5 + hour flight to just worry about it and not get any sleep. I will say the staff did there best to try to calm folks and ensure we would make it and would be taken care of. 

  
So now to the 1st flight on the 767 - It was a full flight. The economy seats were what I expected - I'm 6 foot and I thought the leg room was acceptable. The seats did recline more than I was expecting and the head rest was comfortable. The bottom of the seat though wasn't very comfortable. Was hard and as the hours went by it got harder even sitting on the basic pillow they give you didn't help. The entertainment system was nice - good selection of movies, tv shows, music, some kids stuff, Had a great guide on KEF airport and explained the process once we landed and how connection flights work. So I was very interested in reading through that. I spend most my time watching the flight map and the estimate time of arrival which was torture as it flocculated pretty dramatically. I tried my best to sleep I think I got maybe 45 minutes total. It was hard to get comfortable with the hard seat. Bathrooms were good and clean. Staff came by often offering water, tea, coffee, and soda drinks complimentary. You could pre order a meal or buy one on the flight. Prices were actually decent. Everything I would expect from an econmoy seat. 

As we approached the final hour and reality was settling in as everyone was watching the estimated arrival time. People started panicing about missing their connecting flight. At this point it seemed I was probably a little better than a 50% chance of making my flight it would all depend on how fast we got to the gate , deboarded , and get through immigration which I know from experience was going to be tight. There were others that looked to have no chance of making it and people were getting upset. I'm not sure what the circumstance was but people started grabbing their carry ons from the bin and started walking up the aisle to the saga premium section just standing there like we could land like that and others see this and start doing the same. There was about 30 people literally standing with their carry on suitcases in the aisle as we are starting to descend and prepare for landing. The staff were baffled and shocked they didn't know what to do. One of the staff finally made annoucement that everyone needed to go back to their seats or we can't land. There was one family that initially was refusing but I got to give credit to the staff they did a great job of de escalating the situation and got them to go back to their seats. They did announce that anyone going to Zurich should get off the plane first and everyone else should sit. To my surprise everyone complied and about 20 people rushed off and then the rest of us deplaned in a normal fashion. I was super impressed how quickly we got off that plane and gave me hope we were going to be okay.

Immigration was a breeze - lots of agents - asked a couple basic questions stamped in. KEF airport isn't big and didn't have to go far at all to get to our gate. We made it with about 5 minutes to spare. Our second flight was on 737 max with 3 -3 configuration which if you have every flown Southwest it was very familiar. Again the staff was super nice and welcoming and new I was stressing and offered me some water before take off and let me use the restroom. The second flight was a breeze and even got a little sleep. All of our checked bags made it no problem to Copenhagen. 

In the end Icelandair met my expectations and thought the staff was great. Would like more comfortable seats but that's why people pay for upgrades ;) ",0,1750969553.0,Icelandair,0,0.5,False

 It wasn’t until evening that I sat down at the dining room table so that I could see out the windows facing the backyard. Something about the few glowing street lights in the distance and the occasional whooshing car going by seemed to soothe me. Otherwise, it was dark and quiet, and I had a relatively blank canvas in which to focus my thoughts like a laser.

   Like this man, Carl, I have an appetite for the unknown. I’ve read every book I could get my hand on from libraries, niche mail order, book stores, etc. My mind absorbed it all in fascination and fueled my desire for more. I joined every fraternity I could find from ads in the back of New Age magazines or pagan directories in the 1980's. I also wrote to pen pals and sought out those like me. It was thrilling and yet disappointing at times, but it kept me searching. 

   Likewise, I was also born in the same small town of Boonton, New Jersey, where the President of MRU grew up.  Coincidence? Why does it feel like my path links back to him, that I was meant to cross paths with him again in my twenties when I got into psychotronics and joined the United States Psychotronic Association, of which he was a founding member. Don't ask me how that happened. Radionics was thrust in front of me by a fringe group that I joined, and I think I wanted to learn more about it, but as a general member, I really didn’t have access to much. I was a dabbler, and my interests soon led me to other areas and on my own. But now, I’m revisiting this area in my memories. I think I needed to finally meet this man…at least through words.

   After much delay, I sat down to write this story. I whispered to the shadows of this secret world to let me in, just enough to find some breadcrumbs. I finally got some notes and eventually tried to draft a scene or two. For a working title I’m calling it *Spook Central* or *The Mind Whisperer.* And this is how it starts:

With his shoulder against the wall, a gaunt man in a black suit peeked out the narrow windows, certain that agents watched his movements. The thin curtain billowed as his eyes combed the wet streets below. Carl Schleicher didn’t have to see them; he felt them motionless in the shadows. He was in their cross-hairs. Someone wanted to bury his life’s work. It was 1999 and the year 2000 promised new discoveries, which he had hoped to be around for. He wasn’t so fortunate. At that moment, he got a twinge of pain in his back. His transplanted kidney was failing. Things didn’t look good.

  Taking a quick puff of his cigarette, his mind wandered back in time. He thought about his time focusing on helping Vietnam’s tunnel rats all the way to his days with Blue Sky research and rumors of mind control. Then he almost smiled while revisiting his early life, starting in Reading, Pennsylvania, where he was born on May 5, 1933, and then growing up in Boonton, New Jersey with his parents, brother and sister. He frequented Boonton Falls and hung out at Pond Bridge and the Gracelord Park Dam with some of the boys from school. 

  There were the gently sloping streets of School Street and Main Street, where one could see hills of pine trees rising behind the stores. A hiding place for the Jersey Devil, he mused. Nearby was the brick high school, where he graduated in 1951. It had tall windows and a clock tower, as well as his favorite spot for smoking. 

   Those were good memories. But it was his work with MRU that had been a burning passion. He wanted to take humanity to a new level, and that sometimes took him to gray places. Of course, he was often in black areas as well, when it came to classified projects, but deep down, he wanted these experiments to one day cure AIDS and cancer, accelerate learning, support frontier science, and explore a better Mankind. That time was nearing an end, and most of his experiments would end up back behind a curtain and forgotten in time. He had seen a lot of death in his life, and he wanted to spend his latter days focusing on life and on non-lethal means of combat, as well as healing devastating diseases. That doesn’t mean that some of his projects didn’t end up in the hands of others who would use them for harm. Still, the ripples he created toward understanding the unknown and utilizing that knowledge is still ongoing. With that, he put out his cigarette and tried to make peace with his end. His health was failing and he had made enemies. He was 66 years old. And now a different adventure awaited him.”

  I stopped writing and stared into the Abyss, knowing it stared back. What do I really know about this man? Not much. I only found a little bit online and I’m already reticent. I’m afraid that if my mind touches anything about him that it would create a link, and I don’t want that. It might be like a door that I cannot close, and I don’t want darkness to flood in on me. I also don’t want any uninvited impressions to suddenly come to me, though it might help. I contemplate putting a tinfoil hat on my head before proceeding. I mean, it couldn’t hurt. 

   *Come on*, I scold myself. *Try harder. Put some effort into this. Try to see the real man and not the hype.* And so I did force myself to sift through a bunch of material. It wasn’t easy. I’m an Empath and this is making me squirm.

   I sensed loneliness in Carl. Maybe I’m projecting that, because I’m also thinking about Iona. When I found out that she died, I was devastated. I didn’t know she passed right away. While working at my former medical transcription job, I sensed her presence. Don’t ask me how, I just knew it was her. I had felt her spirit pass through my solar plexus. I thought she was just visiting, but I was busy trying to focus on my job. Every pause in my typing was documented by their software. I didn’t want my boss sending a threatening email about my being too slow. I had already been given a warning.

I teased, “No dirty tricks,” but I was jesting. I knew she’d never hurt me. I loved her like a family member. I called her Aunt Iona.

   I would often get impressions about people from my solar plexus, especially if I got close to them. Once, I got this burning buzzing in my gut. It felt like anger. Sure enough, my ex-husband called me a few moments later, mad about something. In a way, it is how I sense what is going on with people and whether something is wrong. My gut gives me a warning. And I’ve come to trust it. I don’t expect you to believe me.

  When I got the message from Iona’s friend Vickie that she passed, I realized Iona had come to say good-bye and I wept, wishing I had known that I was losing her at that moment. I could have used that time to speak to her. There was so much that I wanted to say. Now, it was too late. Guilt tore through me. Why didn’t I try to talk to her and tell her how much I loved knowing her; what little that I knew. Could I try to contact her on the Other Side? That would be difficult, though I had a glimmer of hope. I’ve talked to my friend Angelique once after she passed (actually it was one word- the name of her killer), so why not her? Because she seemed so wrapped up in the unknown during her life, I feared I’d trespass in some way. I wanted her to be the one to come to me, but had I lost that chance?

My mind turned back to Carl. I’m writing this book for her. And for him? He deserved a fair review of things. I decided to back up a bit in his timeline and typed some more bits of his story.  Picking a place to begin, I imagined him in his Silver Spring, Maryland office to get a feel for things. He also had a bigger office in the embassy district to carry on projects.

   This is what came out:

Sitting in his well worn computer chair, Carl pulled out another pack of Pall-Mall cigarettes while looking at his rows and rows of ""X-Files,"" which he vowed to get through one by one, in his search for paranormal truths. Divided by topics such as psi powers, dowsing, Kirlian photography, radionics, psychics, etc., they awaited his attention. A few of the more intriguing ones remained open on his desk, where he kept a cup of bitter coffee. Roger Little, his office manager, was taking care of mounting bills while his typist, Bob, was clacking away at keys at another desk. And Carl was ready to take on the next mystery. His hand stopped over a Manila folder that held promise. Instead of using invasive measures, Kirlian photography could be used at airports to see if people were violent prone. That would save a lot of time and discomfort for the passengers if it worked. Unfortunately, those in charge preferred to treat all passengers like criminals. 

   Not ready to give up, he put a cigarette to his lips and reached into his pocket for a lighter. As he flicked it, a small flame emerged. It made him think of each project as a potential spark, which could light the way towards fulfillment. Too bad, there were those who would snuff it all out.

I examined what I wrote. I actually didn’t know what kind of cigarette that he smoked and that bothered me, so I thought about what he might have smoked back in his Vietnam days, when Vietnam war C-Ration meals contained a four-pack of cigarettes. The brand might be something like Lucky Strikes, Parliament, Pall Mall’s, Winston, Marlboro, Kools and Salem. I had to narrow that down. My dad was also in Vietnam, driving a PBR. Even got a Bronze Star. He smoked Winston, but I didn’t want to choose that for Carl. I hated cigarettes. That smell wafted from the nicotine-stained walls as clouds of smoke drifted from room to room of the apartment where I grew up, and I’d stick my fingers through them to try to dissipate them when I was a child. Though I never liked cigarettes, I knew that a lot of Military sorts smoked. I wondered if I should choose Parliament, Lucky Strikes or Pall Mall for my story. Maybe he was a Marlboro Man. It would fit him.

Now back to the story:

An interest in dowsing got him into the paranormal, but it was actually dowsing for the Viet Cong. Tunnel rats were soldiers who crawled headfirst into the tight caves and tunnels to find them. Young men were chosen based on their small size for this dangerous job. Sometimes, they had to squeeze through tunnels built for men who were even smaller. They controlled their breathing to squeeze through tight spaces and to combat fear as they entered these dark places, knowing that snakes or traps by the enemy potentially awaited them, and they had a three percent survival rate. The real life expectancy was three seconds. But Carl wanted to change that. After seeing enough death, he started dowsing for tunnels in Khe Sanh for the Marines. He wasn’t sure it would be successful. But one story (from a lecture that he gave) claims that within 24 hours, they found all the tunnels. The Viet Cong assumed they had some new secret weapon, though it was just an ordinary dowsing rod. This led him to Ostrander and Schroeder, who were authors of the book Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain. He paid for translations of Soviet research. It cost him five thousand. The race for psychic powers was in full swing.

Memories of my dad surfaced from the Military references. He was in Vietnam when I was born in 1969. The Red Cross sent the message. He told me bullets were flying around him that day. It was hell. At that time, my Mom was staying with her sister and brother-in-law in Toms River, but she was made to drive all the way to Boonton to give birth. I guess that was where I was meant to set my roots down in this world. Call it destiny.

   Having a complicated relationship with my own dad, I tried not to let that affect my writing about Carl. They were both in the Navy. That makes me a Navy brat.  I have a vivid memory of this man showing up at our apartment when I was about seven or so. He had been on an extended deployment so long that I forgot I had a dad, and here was this blond stranger bringing my sister and I dolls and perfume from France. I don’t know why I blocked him out. I realized that I remembered having a dad when I was younger. It was an adjustment to have him around again. But we never got close like I had hoped.

With Cold War tensions heating up, Schleicher took a deep drag from his cigarette and exhaled a gray cloud of smoke. It morphed into ominous shapes, as if fortelling a great battle he was about to undertake. He had told potential donors that he founded MRU because, “For many months I have heard the comment made, 'fishy our government doesn’t support research in parapsychology areas, as they do in Eastern Europe.’"" 

   He seized a book on his desk by Ostrander and Schroeder and held it up. Here was the evidence.

  He said, “Acting on this message, we in MRU were inspired to attempt to inquire into this. We have found that the government can, and will, support research in these areas, if such research is properly communicated to them, provides a beneficial use of tax-payers' funds, and is conducted by responsible organizations. MRU stands ready to assist any other group to obtain funds for their programs, should they so request it from us.”

Now for some more background information, which I also got from Iona’s websites:

“Psychic Discoveries noted that Soviet experiments were sparked by a 1959 report in the French magazine Constellation regarding alleged telepathy experiments conducted by the U.S. Navy. The article, ""Thought Transmission—Weapon of War,"" was based on a misreading or misunderstanding of Navy activities. Therefore it is possible to characterize experiments in psychic intelligence on both sides of the iron curtain as, to some degree, a comedy of errors.

 

Soviets also noticed a February 1960 story in the French magazine Science et Vie (Science and Life) entitled ""The Secrets of the Nautilus."" It claimed that the US government secretly used telepaths to communicate with the first nuclear submarine, the Nautilus, while it was under the Arctic ice pack. This telepathy project allegedly involved President Eisenhower, the Navy, the Air Force, Westinghouse, General Electric, Bell Laboratories and the Rand Corporation.

 

Communicating with submarines is difficult as radio waves do not penetrate to the depths of the ocean. Extremely low frequency (ELF) waves are used to signal the submarine to come to the surface to receive a message. These super-long waves penetrate almost anything including water but carry little information. If telepathy could work it would be a perfect method of communicating with submerged submarines.  The story was probably a propaganda hoax but the Soviets were spurred into action.”

I see how Carl became invested in the search for the paranormal and for psychic powers. Once he began, he went “all in.” An article in The Post described Schleicher's photos of ""true believers"" on his wall. Iona’s website says, “They included anti-gravity investigators, healers, chemists, psychics, dowsers, and neuroanatomists. They developed a low-frequency electronic device that ‘interferes with insects' antennae.’ But, in typical Schleicher fashion, he tersely declined explanation with a pat answer, ""I can say no more.""

He even once said, ""I consider myself an optimistic skeptic.” 

Because it said that he kept a bulletin board, I added this to my story about him:

Carl then rose from his worn chair and approached his bulletin board, pin in hand. Shrewd eyes scan each and every face of those whom he studied, such as Edgar Cayce and people from all areas of the unknown. There were notables such as ESP expert/ hypnotist Milan Ryzl, and remote viewer Ingo Swann, who he worked closely with.

He raised the next polaroid in his hand and added one more to the collection, like a butterfly he hoped to capture — a smiling little girl with blonde hair. The sharp pin punctures her head as he affixes the photo to the board. 

Okay, maybe that last part didn’t really happen. I don’t have any abilities on par with those he studied. But I was also into Edgar Cayce and spent a lot of time at the Association for Research and Enlightenment as a teen, as well as pondered his cures and predictions, and spent hours playing with Zener cards with my older sister. We got pretty good at it. It led to a lifelong fascination with the Unknown...and the people in it.

  \- another dating app in a world with 8429 dating apps

  \- charging money to tell people they suck

  \- ios only like it's 2012

  \- my ui probably looks like i designed it (because i did)

  \- solving a problem that could be fixed by just... asking a friend

I just want to make sure I'm going to a safe enough town because I will have my laptop, tablet all my stuff for college, And I'll be alone lol. Drop your suggestions!

I really don't care about my life at all. I am 24. I never achieved anything. I'm studying a degree I don't like. I am in huge debt probably by the end of June if I don't take action. I did a lot of things I just down right should be shot for. The only thing I do is wake up, smoke cigarettes, drink coffee, scroll tiktok, masturbate and in the evening I get drunk. I do this every day as long as I can remember. I am too lazy to seek help. I just dont want to talk to anyone. I know meds would help me, I just dont care. I have friends I just keep around for fun. I text them when I feel like, but I know nothing about their life and they know nothing about mine. I could not care less about them. I am living together with my sister in a small apartment we rent. I can visibly see how she is disgusted and dissappointed in me and I know if she had the choice she would move out. But I do nothing about that. My life is going to shit before my eyes and I just let it without doing anything. I am a horrible son, brother, friend and just a shit person in general. I just don't know what to live for. Its not that I dont enjoy things like drawing and whatnot. I dont feel depressed either. I am not sad. I am just existing and tbh I could not care less if I am dead or alive.

I'm 44, an engineer, a geek, and single. I'm very physically fit and somewhat muscular except for my face which shows age. I've done nothing but work for the last 20 years. I dress very well. I shave my head. I have a stable job and a history of relatively large work projects. I've achieved a lot.

I love coffee, 80s and 90s music, and walking. I also enjoy reading. I have a sense of odd humour. I was a fan of the early Family Guy seasons.

I won't beat around the bush. I'm looking for a lady 35+ for a long distance relationship. 

Send a picture if this is something you can commit to. I'll send one in exchange. I have the means to travel (when on vacation from work) and I live a very peaceful and comfortable life. I'm open to moving in together so it won't be long-distance for the rest of eternity. I've travelled a lot and flights feel the same as bus trips to me. Most places I've been to, even if visually different, have felt and looked the same to me.

\- Be 35+ years old so we are from the same generation.

\- I would rather be with someone who doesn't identify by opinions on any political, social, religious, or cultural matters. I'm a very culturally neutral person myself. I'm a Muslim. I don't care what you are.

\- It is best if you are GMT-3 to GMT+8, otherwise it will be difficult.

\- Most importantly, don't ask why I am single. I have very valid reasons.

\- I appreciate women with strong personalities.

Please only send a message if you are single and interested in the same thing. Also make sure you are able to hold a conversation since that is a main criteria and you are willing to move to a voice/video chat platform soon.",1,1750968983.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1llaffb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1llaffb/any_suggestions_or_opinions_as_to_how_i_can_get/,Any suggestions or opinions as to how I can get to closer to him?,"TLDR: interested in a coworker during a summer job, we haven’t talked much yet, i know about his name, tasks he has to do and parts of his future masters degree. I did an erasmus intership last year and he wants to do one, i wanna give him my contact to guve him tips, I also have been thinking about asking him more about his schedule for the job and about trying to make a bit of a conversation to start the day. 

——

I (19 F) have been interested on someone I’ll call Alex (21M). We work at the same supermarket, it’s not that big since it’s in a city and on each shift there are about 20 workers in the shop. I do the cashier and stocking on the shelves when there aren’t many customers, he does shipping and stocking as well. We don’t work in the same rows and we don’t see each other a lot, we saw each other on breaks only a few times only, once at lunch (during a 30min break) and twice in the morning because we got here earlier than the beginning of the shift. Since we both are doing summer jobs, we won’t see each other for long and we aren’t in the same university as well, so basically we will see each other at work up until the end of august. 

When it comes to personnality and interactions, he seems neutral, not that open nor that close, when we first met it was at lunchtime and he was curious, like my studies, if it was a summer job, we talked about what he was doing and wanted to pursue in his masters degree and internship, and we talked a bit about that. The other morning we couldn’t talk much, and this morning, i could ask him his name, and we talked a bit about what was our tasks here. I do look idiotic though, the answers to my questions are sometimes that simples and he seems to see that. He attracts me well, so far he has ideas that aren’t far from mine, he is down to earth and respectful. Also being more extroverted and welcoming is nice of him and makes him more approachable to me and less awkward (i feel like im a bit socially awkward so him being open helps a lot). And finally I won’t deny it, he is handsome to me, he gets clothes that are neutral and confortable, a bit minimalistic since he goes for black oversize clothes that don’t have details (in either the clothe’s shape, color, fabric etc), with a 3day old beard ar most that suits him well, and honest some of the best proportions to me.

Now to know him better i have a few ideas but I need your opinion on them:

1- I know that next year, he wants to do an erasmus program for a few months for his masters degree, he is just applying and praying to get taken, but nothing is sure, he just has a list of where he wants to go. As I did an erasmus internship this year, I am very tempted to give him my contact and tell him that if he needs infos for erasmus applications, tips to survive and have fun in another country or just to organize what he needs. It is quite straightforward, but it can be helpful for him anyways, he know i did one, i told him a bit about it. 

2- go for the slower method but go surely to get to know him better, i saw that he arrives 5-10min in advance eaxh days, but don’t even know when and how long he works, not about anything about his life outside. It makes me tempted to ask him wich days and when he works, maybe get to know if he commutes a lot to get there or not.

3-  Ask him about small things each days we see each other and try to get to know better about his personality or methods of thinking. Since each of the times I saw him get a coffee from the automatic coffee machine, i can make a remark like « bad day without coffee? », or like  be the dumbass that will ask the asshole question of the day, something like « I’ve been thinking, what is the best shape between a triangle and a circle? » (that’s the type of questions that i always ask myself), or just have a small conversation about a random thing like « you were right about some customers being rude and racist, some are  such entitled karens and shit…» or « itold you were my university is placed but i dont know where yours is and Im quite curious, where will it be ? »


I don’t have much ideas left but if you have more I am open, feel free to give me opinions and ideas :)
