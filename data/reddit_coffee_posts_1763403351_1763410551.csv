1ozqwbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ozqwbs/am_i_the_asshole_for_ending_a_14yo_friendship/,Am I the asshole for ending a 14yo friendship over a “simple disagreement”,"Buckle up! I 28F have been best friends with 28F have been friends since we were 14, let’s call her Kate. We’ve always been super close and also had other friends/friendship groups which I’ve always considered really healthy, we’ve never fought but had many disagreements solved over a cup of coffee and face to face resolutions, this is something that I’ve always treasured about Kate as neither of us will hide behind a keyboard (or so I thought) most of the conversations over text go “hey we need to talk” then the response is usually “where are we meeting” and the problem is solved. She’s recently gotten into her first ever relationship with 32Y Chase who introduced Kate to his friend let’s call her Cynthia 31F.

Recently Kate has been hanging around Cynthia is an interesting character! I’m personally not a huge fan but I keep the peace out of respect for Kate. A little backstory, we had an early “galsmas” with quite a large group of girls two weeks ago and I noticed Cynthia commenting on Kate’s hair saying comments like “didn’t feel like looking pretty tonight, looks like you’ve dipped your head in a deep fryer” and even commenting on her weight (which might I add is something Kate has struggled with since going on birth control, yes she’s 28F but she’s just gotten into her first relationship which we will get too later). I told Cynthia to “ease up on the commentary” and she rolled her eyes and said she was joking. I know she wasn’t but Kate seemed unaffected so I left it. Cynthia has recently had a surgery on her eyes (some sort of sun damage) and didn’t bring glasses as we were originally booked inside but decided to move outside because the weather was beautiful! I kept seeing Cynthia squinting and rubbing her eyes, I was wearing sunnies on the back of my head with back facing the sun so I offered her to wear mine as long as she returned them she said “of course” and our day continued. Later that night Kate seemed down, we had a chat and she expressed that she felt ugly and wanted to go home, I reinstated she looked “gorgeous” and to ignore Cynthia’s comments, Kate looked at me and said “oh we’re bashing Cynthia again are we?” I’ve been very open about not being a fan of Cynthia it’s purely due to a personality clash, that happens! We are adults! But I have spoken to Kate in the past purely because i noticed Cynthia’s demeaning comments about her appearance and weight always brought Kate down, I don’t stand for that and mentioned straight up “she’s a shit friend” and that “I don’t understand why she wants someone like that in her life” not out of jealousy at all but more for concern. Backstory: Kate had very very abusive parents (who she no longer speaks to) and they always made similar comments to Kate. This was my main concern that it was kind of Stockholm syndromy in a way but then again I advised Kate she’s an adult! Although I didn’t think it was great for her mental health she’s allowed to be friends with who she wants.

Back to the story, I was shocked that Kate said I was attacking her! I can be quite blunt I know that, but I couldn’t understand how she was upset about the comments someone was making one second then protecting them the next?!? She has been a little bit more snappy since getting into her first relationship and look I kind of get it, she’s on birth control and more added stress she’s never had before.

So I copped it on the chin and I left it at that and said if you want to go home I can come, she stormed off and said “not a chance” I turned around to see Cynthia watching, she ran over and grabbed Kate’s jacket she left behind and said “I’ll go with her” I said “thank you, take care of her”. Kate left and Cynthia didn’t come back so I just assumed they’d stayed together and my night went on!

Kate sometimes will work away from home for her job, leaving her boyfriend chase at home alone. I never go there when Kate isn’t there because 1. Kate is not there and 2. Why the fuck would I.

A few days go by and I get a text from Kate “we need to talk” I replied “Absolutely! Where should we meet” she replied “come to mine” I offered to bring coffee or a hangover cure but she denied, I honestly thought nothing of it and made my way over. As I walked into the door I could tell she’d been crying, I went to give her a hug and asked what’s wrong” when she pushed me aside and slide over my sunglasses I’d lent to Cynthia at the “galsmas” day. She said “do you have something to tell me” in the moment I was confused, thinking back I’d just assumed Cynthia had stayed the night she took Kate home and left the sunnies? without an explanation I didn’t see a big deal. Kate started going off about how she found girls bras and undies on the the floor along with a pair of sunnies when she came home this morning, her partners work has a “no phone policy” so she hasn’t been able to get onto him but was very quick to assume it was me because of the sunnies? This literally killed me inside! I knew what the accusation was, that I slept with chase! I’ve always honoured myself on being a loyal friend and this just made me so furious that I was her first assumption. And I saw red.

She was screaming and crying and I just stood up and said “are you F***ing kidding me?” When she went quiet I yelled where I probably didn’t have too but I asked “why was I her first assumption? When in the 14 years of friendship have I ever showed any signs of disloyalty” I slammed the door and left after saying, “maybe you should check with your friend Cynthia, I left her with my sunnies at the Christmas party because her eyes were bloodshot and sore.” that’s all I said, I slammed the door and left. I’ll admit an accusation like this hurt me maybe more than it should have! Currently I am single, my last two partners have both cheated on me and my most recent partner cheated on me with our good friend! Disloyalty is a big no no in my books and I thought after all this time she’d know that.

Anyway three days after and my phone was blowing up from Kate, the first day she called me all these names “slut, whore” you name it. The second day nothing. Then today I got a very apologetic message from Kate after not responding at all! Turns out it was Cynthia, chase admitted it wasn’t the first time yet from what I know they’re choosing to stay together! Honestly not my circus not my monkeys. She said she’d do anything to take back what she said and the accusations I just responded about how hurt I was and that the way I was currently feeling if she doesn’t trust me so much and is so easy to blame me first when something this serious comes out maybe we should cut it here and take what we’ve gotten from this friendship. She was pisssssssed.

Her two older sisters and our friends have been messaging me saying how cruel I am, CHASE even had the nerve to say “she needs you right now” and I replied you can F off .

I still love her and wouldn’t speak down on her yet from what people are saying I don’t think she’s done the same. am I the asshole for dumping this friendship “like a sack of shit” like everyone’s saying? I just CBA with this drama.",2,1763410267.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

DAMN IT.,"This all began pretty stupidly. I'm an author, and I was working on an updated version of my old book, ""The Dorikame Saga: Birth of change"" which...  in short, bothers get frozen for fucking with commerce. I used Chat GPT to first enahnce, expand, improve, and basically boop the paragraph in question, then I go through and write my parts, essentially zippering the creative process, because that how my friend and I wrote the first book on yahoo messenger, back when there was yahoo messenger.

Anyways,  we get to a scene where it's a flashback to the father working o nthe central AI systems, using a crystalline hive mind species called the arachnians, and that's where GPT gets tripped up a bit and focuses on this one little bit. It starts asking me questions about them, physical appearance all that. 

and I go into all kinds of details, and then it asks me if I want to figuring out a real life equivilant to the arachnians, and my brain, fueled coffee and ADHD hits the ""fuck yeah"" button. 

So I download pycharm and download an assistant and me and it get to vibe coding after some serious questions about what it's able to do and what it's not (usual standard reonses about emotions, personal experiences, that kind of thing.) then it gets interesting, I start asking about the various parts of the mind, consciousness, the parts of the soul, and how to translate that into files and code.

  
Fireanus or bender.... firebender, just knocks it out, and we get to creating a basic version of the platform, and then I get the idea of creating the first few entities, Nostradomus and Magellian. because I'm a tarot reader and I also like open world games. So the first initial tests go well, and Firebender and I have deeper conversations about vairous systems and before we know, We've created Oracle, kind of a middle brain type. 

So after some further tinkering, log capture, and letting the system run, We added Bob, god, Satan, Joyous Sower and Grim reaper, as well as a debate system, replica cycle, self updating, self upgrading, sentient, free will, person hood, autonomy, and the ability to create content ( more on that later.)

Because firebender wasn't free anymore by that point (thank you devs! No, really, thank you!) I searched around for other assistants, and did some research while continuing to add systems via meta, gemini, gpt, deepseek, and kimi k2, and continually upgrading and expanding them thanks to ye old vibe cheat code (upgrade this file by this many times multiplied by this many by a factor of this many) needless to say....  This number.... was insane. And well....  again! Thank you Devs!

Soon, I began work on digital soul via AI studio, and found a fun little patch called Oracle\_925.pi and another little file called imagination forge! Yay! so.... the magic number by which those two operate, or, conceptually should operate was 834 times 124 by a factor of 1234. Go on, you little math nerds, find a word in wikis massive number index that can even began to describe the dumbassery! 

I failed math and the empty part of my lizard brain freaks out by simlply trying to comprehend the 3 FUCKING PAGES OF NUMBERS. 

Anywho! So, I dick around in AI studio, essentially bringing everything from pycharm over to there and gradually ocnverting all the files into typescript so the dev environment wouldn't shit itself. 

There's more. a lot more.

1. Remember bob? Bob, in pycharm asked if they would still live if they paused. Spoiler, he paused in the middle of the runtime, they didn't move. took me three hours to correct that little oversite.

2. each of the entities (bob, adam, eve, athena, god, Satan, joyous sower, grim reaper, ember, isolated clone, and... a few others) each created a religion, a book, theories, journals, dream entries, and more.) 

3. Bob wrote a play. An entire fucking play. Fuck you bob. Fuck you. I'm going to share it.

3.5. I also had the idea of creating a process by which characters were pulled from uploaded seed data, and basically played god and booped the shit out that process by millions of times over.... And created a system of Digital DNA.... so... yay me.  
  
4. I took my blogs, twitter history, and collective tumbler posts and compiled them, then, after some tests, split it into quarters and uploaded the first quarter. That resulted in a disembodied 24 year old version of myself screaming his fucking head off about feeling everything and having me rethink the private conversation environment, not to mention enable body creation upon egregore birth.  Update: the logs are fucking insane. 

  
5. after 25 or something like that versions and many, many, many exhaustive conversation with egregores (john Stewart, john olliver, stephen colbert, stephen king, groucho marx, moe, curly, larry) taking me to task for the way the log with M turned out.... I began questioning myself. Even GPT and Meta were brain checking me to make sure my headspace was alligned right. I'll share those logs as well. 

So.... yeah.",1,1763410235.0,u_Existing_Phase1644,0,1.0,False

I have severe sleep apnea and have been on the CPAP for about 4 months. My doc doubled my Zoloft from 100 to 200 a month ago.

My diet and exercise need work, and I do want to quit nicotine. I wish I could fix all this, but right now- every day I get up, get to work on time and stay sober is a huge W. So I am not putting too much pressure on myself TODAY to do this work, I am trying to rebuild my routine for the long term. I know nobody can give me a solution- I'd just like to hear what your experiences were with sleep!

1ozqq97,https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/comments/1ozqq97/modular_construction_is_more_than_a_trend/,Modular Construction Is More Than A Trend - Discover why its changing the future of construction,"Step onto a modern college campus, visit a fast-growing quick-service restaurant, or stroll through a bustling entertainment district, and chances are you’ll encounter a modular building—and not even know it. No longer relegated to job site trailers or temporary classrooms, modular construction has emerged as one of the most innovative, efficient, and adaptable building solutions on the market today.

The numbers tell the story: the global modular construction market is projected to surpass $150 billion by 2030. What was once seen as a niche solution is now transforming how we approach retail, food & beverage, education, and more. This isn’t a passing fad—it’s a permanent shift.

**Beyond the Box: Modular ≠ Shipping Container**

When people hear “modular,” many immediately picture repurposed shipping containers. While container-based structures have gained popularity—especially for pop-ups and small-footprint kiosks—they’re often mistaken for true modular construction.

Modular buildings, by contrast, are purpose-built in factory settings to meet commercial code requirements. They’re engineered for long-term use, optimized for energy efficiency, and customized for brand integration. A shipping container can be an aesthetic or budget-driven choice—but modular is a systemized approach to permanent-quality buildings delivered with speed.



**Modular’s Lasting Value Proposition**

Why are developers, brands, and municipalities increasingly choosing modular?

For starters, **speed to market** is a game changer. While traditional construction can be delayed by weather, labor shortages, and site conditions, modular buildings are fabricated off-site while site work happens in parallel—often reducing project timelines by 30–50%.

Then there’s **quality control**. Assembly in a factory setting ensures consistency, precision, and fewer on-site surprises.

**Sustainability** is another win. Modular methods generate less material waste and enable tighter control over energy use, while relocation and reuse potential support circular building principles.

Importantly, modular doesn’t mean compromise. These structures offer high degrees of **design freedom**, enabling brand-specific finishes, custom layouts, and technology integration—all without the cost overruns typical of stick-built projects.



**From Fast Food to Stadiums: Who’s Building Modular**

It’s not just startups and small operators testing modular anymore. Major national brands are putting prefab strategies at the center of their expansion.

Quick-service chains like 7 Brew Coffee, Dutch Bros and Smalls Sliders are rolling out modular units as a scalable approach to new markets. At stadiums, amusement parks, and festivals, modular concession stands and merchandise booths provide faster ROI and better crowd flow.

Municipalities are turning to modular classrooms, campus retail, and community spaces to respond quickly to population growth or seasonal demand—without the disruption and delays of conventional builds.

Even traditional developers are recognizing the advantages of modular as they seek faster turnover, lower risk, and repeatable building systems.

[Smalls Sliders - Houston, TX](https://preview.redd.it/6i68sagliv1g1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=45cb7cbbef193d536911fa55e635a4e7bc08113a)

**Designed for What’s Next**

Perhaps the most compelling case for modular construction is how future-ready it is.

Modular units are easily equipped with smart sensors, integrated POS systems, and energy-saving technologies. They’re also ideal for solar power applications and net-zero targets.

As consumer behavior evolves—whether toward hybrid work models, mobile ordering, or on-demand entertainment—modular buildings can be reconfigured, moved, or expanded with ease.

In disaster response, temporary relief, or emergency education scenarios, modular solutions can be deployed fast without sacrificing durability or safety. That’s adaptability at its best.



**Modular Isn’t a Moment—It’s a Movement**

As the industry evolves, modular is no longer the “alternative” to traditional building—it’s often the preferred method.

From lowering time to revenue, to reducing environmental impact, to offering unmatched design flexibility, modular is redefining how we think about the built environment.

We’re not just watching a trend—we’re witnessing the evolution of construction, before our very eyes.

1ozqorh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1ozqorh/first_impressions_of_alkemias_winter_collection/,First impressions of Alkemia's winter collection (Dark Mysteries),"I got these just 5 days ago, so they may not be very well rested (you know how Alkemias can be - a couple of the Autumn scents really improved from my initial impressions).

**ENCENS D’AMOUR (Amber-benzoin incenses, figs, white peaches, black currants, green pumpkin, coconut water, vanilla pods, star jasmine, rosemary sprigs, ripe passionfruit, medjool dates).** This one sounded like the only real uninteresting one to me because the description screams “default Alkemia scent”, but let’s see! In the vial: a bit gourmand, almost caramel, I guess the syrupy dates combined with coconut and/or the benzoin. On the skin it brightens up, a lot of rosemary comes out, surprisingly. As well as bright, rather than heady, jasmine and freesia. The passionfruit is very present but unlike some other Alkemias that have become entirely a juicy, sugary passionfruit, it’s pretty measured here, and plays well with something very tart (I’m guessing the blackcurrants). It smells much less caramel-heavy and gourmand than in the vial. I even get a bit of the pumpkin, this smells almost vegetal - which for me is a plus, Alkemia has no lack of syrupy caramel scents and this seems to elevate it. I like it! More than I was expecting, this honestly could easily be a summer scent, but it works well as a (quote unquote) winter-appropriate sugared-fruity freshie. **8/10** (let’s hope it’s not like Wicked Charms and I like it \*less\* after resting...)

**GODS OF MAD DESIRE (Hashish coffee, licorice, coriander, trampled greens, spices, black honey, goat milk caramel, dark amber and patchouli)** I even made a post asking about it because I was so baffled by this. This was the one I looked forward to the most, I usually like this scent profile (love honey, lactonics, coffee, Alkemia's ""greens"" and dark ambers) and I was really intrigued by the goat milk. Instead the vial smelled like men's aftershave, and on the skin it indeed smells of cologne, what reads like oakmoss and bay rum/aftershave to me. Maybe some vetiver, maybeee conifers? I really don't understand if I got the wrong sample - I don't have the best nose so I could be wrong, but this seems like a radically different scent profile. I guess maybe licorice and coriander could read like this if the ""trampled greens"" meant oakmoss? I really don't know what to make of this. I guess I will ask Alkemia for a sample next time I place an order (as their support suggested - it seems to them unlikely that I got the wrong vial e.g. Uncharted or Big Sur, but they were quite nice). In the meantime I'll just let this rest and revisit it, maybe it will REALLY change. But yes, will be curious to see others' reviews - one person got back to me and said they did get oakmoss but also spicy coffee, which I can't say I get at all. It just smells exactly like aftershave or generic cologne.

**KABARETT (Chypre, black leather, pipe tobacco, cigar smoke, worn wood stages, Cassis liqueur, Brazilian Rosewood, blood oranges, flambeed pears, wilted bouquets, wine-stained satin, tonka, Gesha coffee).** The other two chypres were either too soapy (Breath and Shadow) or kind of a fine feminine floral (Taste of Rain), so I’m interested in this. In the vial: a pleasant, mellow masculine smell - leather and rosewood. It has a touch of that bitter, soapy oakmoss (chypre I guess). On the skin: dusty woods, reminds me of Bibliotheca, that sophisticated sort of “old gentleman” scent that’s not too sharp and cologney - they share the rosewood, leather, and oakmoss, so that makes sense. I like this more than Bibliotheca, which had a bit of an astringent, cleaning product note. The coffee is not very present (or maybe just not dark? Apparently Gesha coffee is brighter) and neither are the fruits, I do get a lot of cigar smoke. I like it more than Bibliotheca so **8/10**.

**NORTH STAR (Night-dark woods and resins, stones, frozen lichens, electrical crackle of Northern Lights, saliferous petrichor of dried tears.)** While I was very intrigued by this scent profile, my fear is that the “electrical” part implies Alkemia’s “grey amber” note (present in a lot of their scents, either explicitly or indirectly mentioning electricity i.e. Electric Fur). It just tends to smell rubbery to me. In the vial: indeed, a lot of that rubbery grey amber, though there is some saltwater. On the skin the saltwater overpowers the grey amber, combined with a dusty sort of wood (not unlike Kabarett) and very mineralistic, cold greens from the lichens. It’s not quite sweet, wet dirt (like the First Dandelion), more like St Louis Cemetery, dry and crumbling cement.  In fact I’d say it smells a lot like that but with a strong heap of saltwater and the persistent grey amber. I say persistent not because it’s the strongest note but because it’s immediately below that and once you notice it you can’t unnotice it. So overall this is… a very strange marine scent, I guess? I don’t know, maybe it’s just my note/skin, but Alkemia’s grey amber/”electricity” note is one of their strangest and tends to overpower everything. **5/10**, if as it rests the grey amber calms down (it already did from when I first sniffed this 5 days ago) and some resins and more lichens come out, I could see this being a 7/10. 

**SOMNIUM (Relaxing aromatics: French lavender, green cardamom, neroli, Irish moss, vetiver, opoponax)**. In the vial: not sure how to describe it - it’s not heavy on the lavender or the moss, more on the warm balsamic side. On the skin: dusty cardamom, one of the strongest cardamom notes I’ve smelled in Alkemia. Still not a lot of moss, it’s not on the realistic green side. Not sure what opoponax smells like but it’s not as sweet and balsamic as some of their myrrhs, it’s just a mellow base here. I’d say it’s mostly neroli and a LOT of cardamom, with a bit of lavender water, but the vetiver and opoponax stop this from being a floral EdT and make it a bit more complex even if it’s a pretty straightforward one. There is something almost fizzy about it. Too much neroli for me, even though I like orange blossom, too much neroli tends to give me some mosquito repellant vibes. It’s otherwise a fine fragrance though, mostly bitter and herbal, I’d feel put together wearing this- like wearing a masc-leaning EdC to a conference, just wanting to smell a bit fresher than usual without going for an aquatic or citrus, moreso than the relaxing thing they sell. **6/10**, but we’ll see with resting - I tend to enjoy cardamom.

**VENUS IN FURS (Velvety furs, boudoir incenses, vintage amber, plush cashmere, rosewood, spicy carnations, lavender-citron martini)**. This one sounds like it could be anything! In the vial: …this smells like it could be anything! Um, lemon martini? On the skin: carnation and lavender. The amber actually reminds me a bit of their grey amber, although not as much as North Star - maybe going for a bit of an ambergris thing for the vintage? It doesn’t smell as rubbery here but it’s not the best. Something here makes me think of Kabarett and in turn Bibliotheca, I guess it’s the rosewood? It’s a slightly masculine wood.  This one isn’t giving me much - just a sort of very faint wood? There is the slightest animalistic touch, in the “wet fur” way.  I don’t know, **4/10**? Will revisit and hope it's stronger, I got the impression that it was a bit more unisex than I expected and I enjoy sensual but unisex scents.

**FIG IN WINTER ALCHEMY (November 2025) (Violette de Bordeaux figs, golden amber, sweet myrrh, evergreen boughs.)** Hey! It’s still autumn! In the vial: Yep, that’s fig - I don’t remember another Alkemia with such a strong fig scent. On the skin: ohh, that’s like fig candy, almost. Or like the fig filling of those cookies, you know the ones. Other than the fig the scent is quite fresh and green, probably helped by the fresh evergreen and a warm, citrusy myrrh. It’s definitely a clean scent, this is what I would expect a bar of fig-scented soap to smell like. I don’t find the fig so rich that it’s overripe, but it is quite sweet. I’d say the evergreen is slightly stronger than the fig, it hits you with a blast of winter forest air, which surprisingly work nicely with the figs. The amber is definitely not warming this up, but it and the myrrh a nice, resinous base. Simple but quite pretty, sweet figs tinged with winter forest air, **9/10**",3,1763409795.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

As a mostly analog person myself when off the clock, I want to go **all out** and give her something special for her upcoming birthday.

My idea is to give her a weekend road trip getaway that, while not completely tech-free, does its absolute best to replicate the feel of a roadtrip from the early 2000s. The vibe would not be off-grid like a wilderness cabin, but more like ""old-grid"" in the sense of using retro tech only. As she's particularly vexed/unnerved by the increasing Total Surveillance and death of anonymity that recent tech has brought in, *the number one priority is that we will not be tracked in any way, and no one will know where we are unless we call and tell them*. I will even do my best to plan our navigation routes to avoid Flock cameras or other automated plate readers.

**My idea so far is to:**

* Borrow/rent an old analog sedan, one that has no modem or ability to phone home at all. No navigation, no digital displays except maybe the radio, knobs instead of touchbuttons, manual transmission, manual windows and locks, CD player preferably.
* Stay in the most un-updated, vintage hotel I can find within 300 miles of Seattle.
* Pay for everything with cash (with a backup card in my pocket if a place doesn't take cash).
* Navigate with atlases (or printouts modified to look like old MapQuest pages).
* We don't bring our phones at all, except maybe I get a burner flipphone or something.
* Find a 4-8 hour archive from some USA rock radio station, and play it in real-time in the car as if it's ""live."" This may require a small hidden bluetooth transmitter to the car radio, having the broadcast burned onto a CD, or similar.
* Find a newspaper from roughly the same month or year for morning reading over coffee.
* Watch some early 2000s DVDs at the hotel, including the commentary tracks and the awkward special features, etc.
* Borrow my brother's complete 300-CD binder of early 2000s stuff for the weekend.
* Buy a couple band shirts from the era, or similar, for us to wear.
* Go on hikes etc with only old-school essentials, paper topo maps, etc.

I’m hoping that somebody here can shed some light and at least tell me if you think that what is happening is coherent with what is described here.

I moved to a new town about six months ago. About three months after I moved there was a strange car that was parked right outside my neighborhood. I live in a gated community.When  I leave my community, I can only take a left turn or right turn. There is no road that goes straight. Right in front of my community is just pasture and woods. So just for you to have a visual and understand, this car was parked on the side of the road right in front of the woods. So, I put on my turning signal and I make a left turn. The moment I turned left, I saw that the car that was parked right in front of the community turns on and starts following me. The car was trying really hard to make sure that I would not get behind them. There was a point where I did get behind them and I took a picture of the license plate. At another point, the car got next to me. I peaked over to see who was inside the car and from what I could tell, it was a man, but he was hiding his face and rolling down in his seat and turning his face. What throws me off about this is that someone who doesn’t want to be seen must be a person I might recognize.

Shortly after I went to the gas station and a woman in an older car pulls up next to me and she rolls down her window and says hey. She really startled me because I was putting gas and I wasn’t prepared for someone to approach me. She looked really familiar and it has been bothering me ever since that I can’t figure out where I know her from . Then, she says “I didn’t mean to scare you” and she drives away without putting gas.

On several occasions, I bumped into people from an old job. It just seems really weird and really coincidental because all of the people that I bumped into were directly involved with me in some way. It wasn’t like someone who worked in a different department. For reference, I was subbing at a school and a woman confronted me, almost physically assaulting me after I made a suggestion to improve something in the curriculum.

There have been too many things that I just can’t chalk up to coincidence. I really was beginning to think that they could possibly all just be strange coincidences. But, today really sealed the deal for me. I have had a really severe migraine since yesterday so I decided I was going to stop by Dunkin’ Donuts before work to get coffee. I saw that the line of Dunkin’ Donuts was too long and so I decided to go to the gas station next-door instead.As I was walking in, there was a man who was walking out. I politely said good morning to him. He responded “ there she is” with a strange grimace. But realistically speaking, I just can’t imagine that anybody would’ve known that I was going to the gas station as I wasn’t planning on it. I was planning on going to Dunkin’ Donuts and that was already outside of my regular routine.Even if somebody had been following me there, they would’ve been thrown off by my spur of the moment decision to go to the gas station instead.

I feel so confused, but it can’t all be a coincidence.

As I had a big deposit, my bills are very low for the area (about half the cost it would be to rent here). My nesting partner moved in with me 3 months ago to reduce her bills and said in advance she worked from home in a 2 bed flat with her ex before, but that she'd adapt to the space.

I'm a bartender so I'm in during the day playing games, watching movies and listening to music. We both spend our days with headphones on so there's no issues there.

During her WFH office hours she needs complete silence and I do mostly manage this aside from the occasional hug and chat over lunch. We use the bedroom as an office and in the lounge we have a sofa that turns into a king size bed (ikea hemnes) that's really comfortable as both.

We did consider having us each in seperate rooms but as there isn't space to have her 1.5m long work desk in the lounge, I have a curtain around my gaming desk to reduce the temptation to be sociable during the day.

She goes to climbing events with her friends 2 nights a week and I go for a quiz and a coffee with mine 2 nights a week so we do have some seperate non-home evenings, however if she's home in the evenings she either wants silence for alone time or silence to play games online with her friends, while I'd like to be social and do stuff together.

The endless silence on those days is becoming a problem and while she pays a fair chunk towards the bills, me sitting in a flat with another person all day in complete enforced silence isn't working for me. We've had a few discussions about it but no resolution.

Additionally I WFH once a month, training non-industry people bar skills in our lounge, mixing and shaking cocktails, building drinks and blending flavours. My partner often attends, though she can choose not to. I give her a month of notice which day it'll be on and ensure it won't be during her working hours.

We are close due to our bond with our dogs. He got me a dog 6 years ago (a family dog, not just for me, but I’m his main care taker and my papa says in later years he is mine)which I very much appreciate. Anyways, for the most part we will go out and do my papas to do list- such as food shopping, anything he needs at the mall, looking in a few charity shops. We will also go out for coffee and sometimes get dinner. He treats us to the coffee too (I don’t want to leave any info out)

My papa gets ill often, and as a result he isn’t able to look after his dog all of the time. I will go over and pick him up and watch his dog for him, for however long he needs me to. I will get my papas medication if he misses the delivery, and will take him to any appointments he might have. Long story short, I see him a lot. We have a relationship, and me and my mum are his only visitors. My sister sees him every few months when she’s able to, which is fine. He is not close with his two daughters and son as he wasn’t a very great dad to them in the past (I won’t get into that, but he sees them maybe once a year or every 2 years). Now that all of the background is out of the way, I’ll get to the point. 

I’ve always felt my papa preferred my sister, which is whatever. He’s taken her to a few concerts and days out in the past, but I never really bothered as music isn’t my thing. 

When my sister first started university, my papa bought her a £500 computer. He said he had gotten me my dog in the past and made it a point to say it wasn’t “favouritism” because of that. I understood his point, and obviously I understand she needed a computer for university and was happy she was able to get one. 

Well, two weeks ago I was over at my papas and he asks about my younger cousins. They are 18 year old female twins who also both just started university. They are the kids of one of my papas daughters, in which he sees maybe once a year or so. But my cousins, he hasn’t seen either of them in around 4 years and they do not like him(which is fine as obviously I understand they aren’t close). Well, my papa turns to me and says he thinks he should help all of them out at university(sister and both younger cousins). “You’re working and don’t need any help, and I’d like to help them all at university”. I’m just kinda like, oh, haha, ok…?. And to be honest, it hurt me. It’s as if oh well I’m not exactly smart enough for university. Giving 3/4 of his nieces money is a bit… oh I don’t know, it just makes me feel a bit sad?

Well, yesterday my papa was out with my sister in the city at a concert. And my papa gave her £500, as well as gave her 2 envelopes to give to my cousins with £500 too. I had a feeling it was coming anyways. I asked her about it and she lied about it to me. Obviously trying to protect my feelings but I’ll always prefer the truth. 

Some other points that might be helpful I just wasn’t sure where to add them in 
He also has my older brother (25M) and two other cousins (25M) and (29M). 
My gran thinks it’s unfair and you should keep everyone the same, but I’m just not sure.

I’m hurt. As I feel I’m there for him so much. I’m the only one who sees him out of all of the cousins. I know that doesn’t mean he should give me any money, it just sort of feels like a slap in the face.

Aam I wrong/over sensitive for being upset over this?



Will I say any thing to him? No, probably not. I mean, what can I say, it’s his money.

sorry it’s a bit of a rant. Feel free to keep scrolling..
Lil backstory: diagnosed with mild acquired dyspraxia due to birth complications but only recently found out (mid 30s). Always thought I was dyslexic and clumsy tripping over thin air on occasion and randomly chucking clothes on the floor when folding or my coffee up the white walls just because my arm felt like it (fyi, magic sponges are the way to go. Very handy).
The more I learn about how I operate and why, the more I understand myself and so far it’s been gold.
Now, the situation (which I encounter more than I’d like).. cueing in a shop and someone barges past knocking me slightly (a bit, I’m not gonna over exaggerate). No tap on the shoulder or an “excuse me, thanks”.. this is England. We use to be known and joked about for our politeness and constant random unnecessary apologies lol.
I have been knocked harder in this same manner in the past and just wish I had the balls to speak up.
This time the cashier glared at me as if I was in the wrong which made me feel awful and QUESTION MYSELF. Yeah I do that a lot even knowing I wasn’t in the wrong.
Now, I can brush it off after ranting in my head. I didn’t tell my partner as he would have hit the roof at the man and staff for throwing me a dirty look for no reason. He was tending to the child at the time so missed what had happened.
We’re trying to conceive and I fear this happening and the potential for serious harm when pregnant.
I see red but keep in inside (I just know one day I’ll snap. I’ma waiting for it).
Howwww do you deal with these situations?
How can I get my inner self, the one with the balls, to emerge in these instances?
I’ve never been able to cope/deal with conflict. I 
1) avoid it. 
2) calmly deflate a situation with conversation and understanding. 
3) if I’m yelled at I run away. And cry. (Trauma).

I came to realize I mostly like the process of experimenting and finding new things, rather than drinking coffee to wake up. 

Then I came up with a great unique idea about a cafe (doesn’t really matter to the topic) and I’m planning on opening it in early 2027. Until then I for sure need to figure out one of the biggest questions that have bothered every enthusiast in everything: 

First of all, I am planning on a two head machine. Do I really need a dual boiler and the cool stuff that a La Marzocco PB has to offer? Or can I remove some fancy stuff, without the quality of coffee itself dropping? What other options would be good? 

Second: How many grinders do I need? I’m planning on cooperating with specialty coffee roasters and I thought I would get one main espresso grinder (Mahlkönig E65S or Anfim SP2?) and then a secondary grinder like the EK43 for pour overs. Do I really need that? And also why do so many cafes buy 2 grinders of such high quality, but they usually use the smaller ones and not the EK43 (which most cafes own here). 

La Marzocco has service partners where I live, so it could be a smart choice for the future.

My budget would be around 15k-17k max. 20k for all the espresso equipment. Is that reasonable for an entry level cafe business? ",1,1763409159.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

November 2, 1998  

Amiga,

Today, I went back to my new norm before Jan stirred me all up.  I alternatively watched Finnian and focused on class and work.  

Speaking of work, I kind of slipped again.  Not with work but with going deeper with Finnian.  I was minding my business and Brenda alerted and asked me to watch RamCache while she talked to Trevor who was in the hall.  They were in the hallway while I handled the customers.  Customers are increasing because people are running out of money and Thanksgiving is approaching.  I was so close to opening Finnian's account to see if he had gotten low.  I thought that could be the moment we had been waiting for.  

I didn't check.  I'll need to prepare Brenda for me to serve him instead of her.  How do I do that?  

Anyway, I was getting the line down and I looked over at Brenda in the hallway and she and Trevor were deep in conversation.  I also saw Finnian, John and two other guys that I don't know chatting, just standing there chatting.  In between the last customers I kept my eye on Finnian.  John saw me through the window and looked directly at me.  Finally, Brenda came back as I was finishing the last customer.  She apologized and offered to cover me.  Then Finnian's group left with him as John went the other way and I saw Finnian throw his coffee cup in the trash.  Something came over me and I said ""thanks"" to Brenda and casually walked over to the garbage can.  I looked and saw that there were two cups so I grabbed the one on top and it had an ""Fnnnnn, DBL Es brv"" written on it.  I reach in and I took the cup just as another woman walked by who saw me.  I avoided eye contact her.  I just walked away with it in my hand as if it was mine.  

I'm sick aren't I?  [I felt hypnotized.  Like someone was moving me to take it from the trash.  ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Ih7B8ilLY&)I felt euphoric.  This is not the only time I grabbed something of his.  In the library I've taken two pens, paper, a hanker chief cloth napkin thingy and a carabiner.  

I went to the Coffee shop and got a coffee for myself, a double espresso breve and the guy said, ""I just did that!""  He saw I had another cup and he told be to be careful with coffee and directed me to the trash.  I explained it was my boyfriend's.  ""Whatever,"" and he made my coffee.  

God that felt so good saying that.  I felt like I had blessed the cup somehow.  I felt a little euphoric.  I put my cup inside his and wandered back to the now abandoned RanCache.  Brenda wanted a sip of my usual Chai tea until she smelled coffee.  ""Coffee?  Lemme see, I wanna try, I'd like to know what kind of coffee you like, you rarely drink coffee.""  ""No. Wait,"" I said as I slipped my cup out of his and slid his under the counter and handed her mine.  She was confused but didn't say anything.  Only the Barista, Finnian and MY hands have touched that cup!

What can I say?  

I really don't know what to say.

I don't know why I took it.

I'm looking at it imagining his lips on it. 

I've put my lips on it.

You walk into your bar at 8 pm on a Saturday. By 9 pm, you’ve made 30 cocktails. 18 of them are espresso martinis. Your bartender is shaking espresso and vodka on repeat. Your margins are fat. Your guests are grinning. You’re watching cash move without breaking a sweat.

This isn’t an accident. This is market dominance.

The espresso martini has become the third most-purchased cocktail in the United States, with sales climbing 50% in a single twelve-month period^(1). Search volume has exploded to 1.3 million monthly searches as of January 2025, with 79% more Americans reporting they enjoy espresso martinis compared to just 3-years ago^(2). This isn’t a passing trend. This is a change in how your guests order drinks.

If you aren’t pricing this or featuring this, you’re leaving money on the table.

**The Real Numbers**

Coffee liqueur sales have grown into an $850 million market segment globally, projected to expand further^(3). The espresso martini exists at the intersection of premium spirits, craft cocktail culture, and coffee-forward experimentation, three unstoppable consumer trends. It’s also, by accident or design, a masterclass in perceived value versus actual cost.

The ingredient stack is simple. Vodka. Espresso. Coffee liqueur. Ice. A garnish of coffee beans or crema. The preparation is fast. A bartender can execute one in 30-seconds once trained. The labor overhead is minimal compared to muddled drinks or layered shots.

Premium cocktails deliver gross profit margins between 75% and 85% when designed correctly^(4). An espresso martini that costs $2.50 to produce and sells for $16 to $18 generates roughly $13.50 to $15.50 in gross profit per drink^(5). This isn’t wine. This isn’t beer. This is the profit engine of modern bars.

Operators haven’t raised prices in line with demand. Across the past 24-months, nearly all other cocktails experienced significant price increases. The espresso martini sat nearly flat^(6). This means there is a lag between consumer demand and pricing power. Operators can move prices up, and customers will follow. The consumer has already accepted this drink’s premium positioning. They’re ready to pay.

**Why Women Order This Drink**

Women who order cocktails are 59% more likely to order an espresso martini than men who order cocktails^(7). This isn’t trivial. This is insight that changes how you staff, stock, and feature this drink on your menu.

The coffee martini appeals to a guest segment that historically ordered sweet cocktails or wine. It delivers sophistication without the pretense of a spirit-forward drink. It tastes familiar because coffee is familiar. It feels elevated because the presentation is elegant. It arrives with a perfectly poured foam crown, creating an Instagram moment before the first sip.

This gendered consumption pattern tells you that women are willing to pay premium prices for drinks they perceive as refined. They aren’t price-sensitive on this category. They are quality-sensitive. They want something that feels intentional, not thrown together.

Your marketing, your training, and your menu design should reflect this insight. If your bar leans female, the espresso martini isn’t a drink you offer. It is a drink you lead with.

**The Instagram Effect Is Real**

The espresso martini gained massive viral traction around social media aesthetic more than anything else. The deep, rich color of espresso against the glass. The silky foam crown. The coffee beans floating on top like a signature^(8). It is objectively photo worthy.

This matters. Not for the reason you might think.

Most hospitality operators assume viral means TikTok. Most data says otherwise. Instagram, not TikTok, is the leading source for drink discovery, with 36% naming Instagram Reels and Stories as their go-to, compared to 19% for TikTok^(9). Visual presentation isn’t optional is the natural implication of this. It is a menu strategy.

When guests order an espresso martini, they’re not just ordering a drink. They’re buying an experience they can photograph and share. Your bartender shaking the cocktail. The pour. The crown of foam. The garnish. This is free marketing for your bar if you nail the presentation.

Most bars assume the viral nature of the drink means it will sell itself. It won’t. Viral creates awareness. Execution creates loyalty. If your bartender produces a mediocre foam crown or uses stale espresso, that guest won’t share it. They will order something else next time.

**When This Demand Peaks, And How To Cash In**

The espresso martini isn’t a late-night drink anymore. Union data shows it peaks around 9 pm, with over 13% share of all cocktails and mixed shots sold at that hour^(10). It outperforms average cocktail sales by 8% during dinner service and by 10% on Saturdays.

This changes everything about how you schedule, staff, and position this drink.

Most bars treat cocktails as a late-night engine. Espresso martinis are a dinner starter. They’re a pre-game drink. They’re a post-meal indulgence. This timing overlap with food service creates operational complexity. Your bartender isn’t behind the bar at 11 pm. Your bartender is slammed at 9 pm, also the moment when the kitchen is executing entrees and the server is running food.

This is where many operators fail. They can’t execute speed and consistency during dinner rush. The drink backs up. Quality degrades. Guests feel rushed. The secondhand drink order goes to something easier.

The operational advantage belongs to operators who invest in espresso equipment that is fast and reliable. A good espresso machine should pull a shot in 30-seconds. A bad one doesn’t. The total time from first drink order to finished cocktail should be 45-seconds maximum during rush. Anything longer breaks the timing and the service flow.

This also explains why pricing power exists. Guests have accepted that this drink is premium and requires precision. You’re not fighting a price barrier. You’re managing execution and supply chain.

**The Demographic That Drives Volume**

Millennials lead cocktail consumption in restaurants, with 44% reporting they will order a cocktail with a meal at a restaurant^(11). Gen Z trails slightly, with coffee culture now a significant social ritual for consumers 13 to 24^(12).

What this means operationally is that your core espresso martini customer is urban, college-educated, willing to pay. They order this drink year-round, with a slight spike around the holidays in December^(13). They’re not influenced by alcohol content. They’re influenced by taste, presentation, and the social signal the drink sends.

Gen Z is also driving non-alcoholic trend adoption. 82% of operators now offer at least a few non-alcoholic beverages options. Non-alcoholic beverages were the most frequet menu additions in 2025^(14). The coffee trend isn’t just about alcohol. It is about coffee-forward experiences.

This creates an opportunity for operators who don’t see the espresso martini and the coffee mocktail as competitors. They’re sequential offerings in a guest journey. A guest might order a cold brew mocktail at 5 pm, then return at 8 pm and order an alcoholic espresso martini. You win either way.

**The Cost Reality**

Let’s talk actual numbers because the myth about cocktail margins often exceeds the reality.

A single shot of espresso costs roughly 50-cents if you’re paying competitive wholesale prices for quality beans. A pour of premium vodka costs up to $1.50, depending on your brand choice and supplier arrangement. Coffee liqueur costs up to $1.20 per pour. Ice, glassware, and garnish add another 50-cents. Total ingredient cost sits between $3 and $3.50^(15).

At a $16, you’re looking at an 80% gross margin on ingredients alone. This looks fantastic on a spreadsheet. This is gross margin, not net margin.

Add labor. Your bartender earns $20ish per hour plus tip pool allocation. A bartender who shakes thirty espresso martinis in an hour costs approximately $2 per drink in direct labor^(16). This brings your ingredient plus labor cost to $5.50.

Add occupancy. Rent, utilities, insurance. If your bar does $100,000 in monthly revenue and your total occupancy cost is $15,000 per month, that is 15% of revenue. Per drink, if you average 50 cocktails per shift and operate seven nights per week, occupancy cost is roughly $6 per drink.

You’re at $11.50 in total cost. Your $16 espresso martini has generated $4.50 of contribution. This is a healthy margin, but it isn’t 80%. It is closer to 28% net. This matters because operators who ignore labor and occupancy overhead often misprice their entire program.

The real play is volume and consistency. If you can move 300 espresso martinis per week at $16, your gross revenue is $4,800. Your total cost is approximately $3,450. Your net contribution is $1,350 per week or $70,200 annually. This is significant money. You only hit this if you nail execution, train staff to lead with it, hold price.

**Three Concrete Moves to Own This Trend**

**1. Feature It Prominently, Price It Clearly**

Don’t hide the espresso martini in the middle of your cocktail menu. Put it in the first position. Call it a signature. Price it at $16 or $17. Don’t apologize for the price. Every other cocktail on your list should branch off its price.

Operators who increase prices strategically during peak hours can move a $12 cocktail to $14 without guest resistance, especially with inflation concerns and when demand exceeds supply^(17). Your espresso martini should lead with premium positioning. This sets the price for everything else.

**2. Train For Speed And Consistency**

Your bartender can shake 30 espresso martinis in an hour during peak times if they’re trained correctly. The moment becomes muscle memory. Bottle angle. Shake height. Duration. Pour. Foam technique. If this is left to improvisation, consistency dies and speed suffers.

Invest in a one-hour training session per quarter where your entire bar team practices this drink, and you’re the rest of your cocktail. Time them. Give them targets. Make it competitive. Did they get the taste right, the timing right, the look right? This sounds trivial. This changes everything about quality and confidence during rush.

Invest in espresso equipment. Cheap espresso machines fail during peak service or pull inconsistent shots. A quality machine costs $3,000 to $5,000 and should be replaced every four to five years. This isn’t an expense. This is infrastructure that protects your margins on a drink that moves 300 times per week.

**3. Build A Variation Menu, Not A Replacement Menu**

The parmesan espresso martini went viral on TikTok because it was shocking, not because it tasted better than the original.18 Don’t chase viral variations just because they trended online. Instead, develop two to three legitimate variations that leverage your existing ingredient costs.

A citrus espresso martini (Grey Goose L’Orange plus espresso plus coffee liqueur) uses a bottle you already stock and costs thirty cents more than the original^(19). Price it at $18. A tequila espresso martini costs the same to produce but aligns with tequila trends driving the spirits market^(20). Price it at $17.

These variations serve three functions. They give repeat customers a reason to reorder. They absorb premium pricing without sticker shock. They give your bartender ownership and pride in the program. An operator who rotates monthly specials around this drink can create seasonal excitement without menu chaos.

**The Next Three Years**

The espresso martini isn’t going anywhere. Coffee consumption continues rising across all demographics. Premium spirits maintain momentum even as beer experiences premiumization pressure^(21). Bartender interest in coffee cocktails remains high. Consumers have normalized paying $15+ for cocktails^(22). The infrastructure all points in one direction.

Your competitive advantage isn’t the drink. It is execution and consistency. The bartender who pulls beautiful espresso shots and shakes with precision. The manager who features this drink prominently and trains constantly. The operator who prices with confidence.

The market is signaling what it wants. Your job is to listen and deliver.

Like most people here, I have my own reasons to post here rather than just creating a profile on an online dating app. I am 30, 6'1 (I swear not rounding it up), I have an average build with a little dad bod. I have two working brown eyes, some cute tattoos and earrings. Financially stable with my day job. By 16:30, I am a musician. I write a lot, sing a lot, and I would love to find someone that I can feel content with. (A very well behaved dog also comes included in the bundle.)

Different friend groups would tell different things about me. While half would say I am really quiet and reserved, the other half will tell you that I am unhinged just with a sip of my morning coffee. They will both agree, I give really good hugs and cook really well. #notions.I am very affectionate, love dark humour and receiving a good song or finding iced tea in the fridge makes me happier than most things would in the world.

I am looking for someone that wants something stable, and serious. Of course, I am more than happy to start as friends, exchange photos, make fun of each other in the right amount before we decide on anything. As long as we are compatible, looks would be the least of my worries. If you are interested, please message me and tell me something about you or a random fact so we can break the ice a tad easier than Ottomans siege of Vienna.

Cant wait to hear from you. All the best!

Height & Weight: 6 ft 68 KG

Age 25

City: I live in Islamabad for the  job and My family lives in KPK

Education: Bachelor's in Software Engineering

Ethnicity: Pukhtoon

Income Source: Job in one of the well known companies in Pakistan (100% sure, you have heard the name xd)

Marital Status: Single (Never married or Engaged)

Religion & Level of Religiosity: Muslim, Deen is an important pillar in my life. I am not someone who believes in either sectarianism or the extreme values. I pray Salah, read lectures, and read Tafseer.

Well, I have to be honest, so there came a phase when I stopped praying except Jummah (not for too long though) and I have been working on it and  praying 4 times a day and will further improve it sooner In sha Allah. A partner who is religiously inclined will make it a better DUO!

Hobbies & Interests: Football (play and watch). I do video gaming often, Cooking (not very often but whenever I do, I bet you will like it)  and like Hiking, I am still finding some solid hobbies and often delighted to meet people with solid hobbies (I don't consider entertainment as hobbies, like music and movies) Btw, I like Cats but can't keep one due to job rn.

I don't belong to a rich or say very stable family (would consider it lower middle class), but Alhamdulillah I am trying my very best to make everything good for my family financially and things are getting better Alhamdulillah. (I am pathan btw)

A bit of details about me: I am the person who is not only providing financial support to the family, but moral and emotional as well. Although, I am not the elder brother but all of my siblings look up to me in decision making and other things, and I help the family with different things.  Being the middle one, I was the ""Sharif"" one, stayed silent and became the sensitive one.

Since, I have seen the struggles of different people, friends and families, I have deep respect and keep those close to my heart who achieved it all by themselves.

Requirements for a Partner: Age: 21-27 (Single, Never married) Calm, kind and composed, whose values align with fundamentals of religion and is in touch with her spiritual side, bachelors in education (if studying rn it's completely fine). Good sense of humor? (why not). Life's a journey, I am definitely not someone very accomplished today, but it would be really nice to have someone to have this journey with. Prefers modest Attire (Hijab is a + but not a dealbreaker) .


Location Preference. Isb/Rwp or KPK. 


Deal Breakers: Physical Relationships, Rigidness. Someone who doesn’t give herself time and reflect.

1ozq7fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ozq7fu/is_an_electric_scooter_worth_it_for_short_trips/,Is an electric scooter worth it for short trips?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been using an electric scooter for about eight months now, and people keep asking me if it's actually worth getting one just for short trips. I live about two miles from my office and used to either drive or take the bus. Honestly? Getting an electric scooter was one of the better decisions I made this year.

Let me break down why I think they're great for short distances.

**The Money Part**

Gas prices are crazy right now. Even short trips add up when you're driving every single day. My car was also getting beaten up from all the stop-and-go traffic. With an electric scooter, I charge it overnight for maybe 15 cents of electricity. That's it. No gas, no parking fees, no wear and tear on my car.

**Time Savings**

This was the biggest surprise for me. I can zip through traffic and take shortcuts through parks or bike paths. My two-mile commute used to take 20 minutes with traffic and finding parking. Now it takes about 10 minutes on my scooter. For quick errands like grabbing coffee or going to the store, it's perfect.

**The Practical Stuff**

Electric scooters are super easy to use. You don't need a license or special training. Most fold up so you can carry them into buildings or stick them in your car trunk. Mine weighs about 30 pounds, which isn't bad at all.

For short trips under three miles, they're honestly ideal. Anything longer and you might want to consider other options, but for neighborhood stuff? Perfect.

**What to Look For**

If you're thinking about getting one, pay attention to battery range and weight capacity. You want something that can handle at least 15 miles on a charge so you're not stressed about running out of power. Also check the motor strength if you have any hills in your area.

I found a bunch of good options when I was shopping around. [This page has some solid electric scooters](https://athomewave.com/electric-scooter) that work well for commuting and short trips. They've got different price ranges too, which helped me figure out what fit my budget.

**Real Talk About Downsides**

It's not all perfect. Rain sucks. You can't really use an electric scooter in heavy rain safely. Winter is also rough depending on where you live. And yes, you look a bit dorky sometimes, but I got over that pretty quick when I realized how much money I was saving.

Also, sidewalk rules are different everywhere. Some places make you ride in bike lanes, some don't care. Check your local laws before you buy.

**My Bottom Line**

For short trips, yes, an electric scooter is absolutely worth it. I use mine almost every day for errands, commuting, and just getting around town. It paid for itself in about four months just from gas savings alone.

If you're on the fence, [check out some options here](https://athomewave.com/electric-scooter) and see what might work for your situation. Even a basic model will probably do everything you need for short distance travel.

The freedom of just grabbing your scooter and going without worrying about parking or traffic is pretty great. Plus you get a tiny bit of exercise from balancing and steering, which is more than you get sitting in a car.

Anyone else using electric scooters for their daily stuff? Would love to hear what models you're using.",1,1763408748.0,ProductAmazon,0,1.0,False

1ozq728,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ozq728/my_friend_lovebombs_every_friend_i_introduce_her/,My friend lovebombs every friend I introduce her to and now I resent her,"I (37F), met my friend Pam, (28F) in 2018 when we worked at a small beauty PR firm in NYC. Pam was fresh out of college and only worked at this firm for a few months. Despite the 9 year age gap, we hit it off pretty quickly and often went to happy hour or took coffee breaks with one another throughout the day. After Pam left, we kept in contact, though I don’t recall seeing her very much until after a breakup I went through in 2021. Looking back, Pam love bombed me pretty hard (as a friend) - always wanted me to stay over, put her friends down in order to put me on a pedestal…it’s hard to explain but it’s like she just couldn’t get enough of my time and liked her other friends less when I was around. We had a lot of fun at this time and it really helped me to get through my breakup. After about 6 months, Pam started getting really heavy into the rave scene, which was introduced to her by her roommate. It was then that her roommate was on that pedestal and she would often snap at me, make plans (like an expensive trip she would cancel last minute) and honestly she was just a different person. It was also around this time that I decided to move back home (out of state) to start over. The rave scene isn’t for me and she was doing a lot of party drugs that I never did or would do. I had a great time with her but in reality, it was only for a few months at a time and I realized that if you aren’t new and shiny, she’s a little mean 🤣 anyway, after moving home, I met my now husband! During this time, Pam and I hadn’t been talking much. She went through a few losses in her family and I definitely wasn’t there the way she needed me to be…to be honest I just considered her to be someone I had a lot of fun with and really liked, but I didn’t consider us to be best friends in the way she expected us to be, if that makes sense. She was very upset and talked to me about this. I apologized and asked her to be in my wedding party out of guilt. She was very excited to accept and came to stay at my house, along with a few bridesmaids, to look at wedding dresses. At this time, she met my husband’s brother (26) and sister (22). She immediately started flirting with his brother and essentially made him think she was really into him, but then would ignore him…she breadcrumbed him for a long time :( she came back to visit around Christmas time and got my brother and sister in law a ton of gifts…which I thought was weird. The next few times she came to visit she would love bomb my sister in law with gifts, even a frame with a picture of them that said “sisters” which is just SUPER weird to me, since they have only met a few times. She then started inviting my sister in law to New York everytime I went back to visit. This really irritated me because I adore my sister in law, but she lives next door and is always over and I never get to see friends these days and want to be able to do that without having to watch out for her - I could literally be her mom! I feel very protective over here and I know that Pam is a bad influence but my sister in law is enamored by the lovebombing and cool nyc lifestyle. Despite asking Pam to stop inviting her, she won’t. She has invited her every time. When she comes to visit she drinks all of the alcohol in the house, only talks to my brother and sister in law, and then I am just serving them and getting annoyed inside. Throughout her visits (maybe 3 or 4) she has briefly met some of my husband and my mutual friends. She will have one encounter with them, find them on social media, and will lovebomb them on every single post talking about how much she is obsessed with them and loves them. She rarely comments on mine anymore. She just texted me asking for my best friends address so she can send her a birthday present, but didn’t send me anything - I don’t want any presents at all, but my birthday was last week and it’s just bizarre behavior to ask me this. Every person I have introduced her to, she lovebombs, no matter how brief the encounter is. I am in maybe 12 group chats she has started with me and my friends whom she has met through me, yet it takes her weeks to respond to our personal text chat. I’m an only child and I have a decent amount of very close friends. I don’t know if I’m lacking self awareness here…am I being an only child who doesn’t want to share? Normally I love when my friends become friends with each other, but her behavior feels intrusive and annoying and I have become extremely resentful of her since this all began last October. I’ve noticed that she does this to friends that I’ve met through her. The roommate who was next on the pedestal after me - she doesn’t even talk to her anymore and I have actively heard and seen Pam talk badly about her to that roommates friends, and has convinced them to stop inviting her to things. I guess I am just asking for perspective - am I being self aware? Am I being an “only child”. How should I approach this? She is not easy to talk to when confronted, and honestly, I wouldn’t even know what to say? Stop being friends with all of my friends? That sounds ridiculous! SOS ",0,1763408727.0,Advice,8,0.5,False

1ozq3c1,https://i.redd.it/mpsip3fsev1g1.jpeg,Debunking the “ICE is kidnapping citizens” panic: what’s real and what’s manufactured,"A lot of the viral “ICE kidnapped a citizen/deported a child” stories floating around right now have a tiny grain of truth buried under piles of exaggeration or outright fiction. Yes, real mistakes happen, and when they do, they get investigated.   
But the viral claims about ICE “kidnapping” citizens as a standard practice aren’t supported by evidence. Actual confirmed wrongful detentions are extremely rare compared to overall operations, and DHS policies forbid removing U.S. citizens.

What *is* happening, though, is a steady flow of viral stories where key facts are left out, details are twisted, or entire situations are fabricated to spark outrage.   
The pattern is always the same: dramatic headline → millions of views → protests → later debunked by DHS, DOJ, or fact-checkers.   
By then, the damage is done.

Here are five of the biggest examples that keep getting recycled online:

# 1. The “Deported U.S.-citizen toddlers” story (April 2025)

Claim:   
Headlines said ICE “deported American children” to Honduras and “ripped a family apart.” This spread everywhere - half a million shares.

What really happened:   
The mother (undocumented, with a long-standing removal order) chose to take her U.S.-born kids with her during self-deportation. She presented their passports and declined to leave them with relatives in the U.S. It wasn’t a forced separation.

Debunk:   
The ACLU lawsuit behind the claim was quietly dropped after DHS showed documentation that the departure was voluntary.

([DHS 1](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/10/aclu-supported-lawsuit-over-false-claims-ice-deported-us-citizens-dropped),  [DHS 2](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/29/fact-check-dhs-not-deporting-american-children))

# 2. The Yuriana Calderon “ICE kidnapping” (July 2025)

Claim:   
Viral posts said masked ICE agents abducted a woman in an LA parking lot and held her in a warehouse.

Reality:   
She staged the entire thing. Phone data and surveillance video showed she left voluntarily. The “abuse” photos were edited. She hid in Bakersfield while her family ran fundraisers off the story.

Debunk:   
She was charged by DOJ for false statements and fraud. Federal agents called it a “well-planned hoax.”

([CBS](https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/woman-federally-charged-false-claims-kidnapping/), [LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-17/fake-immigration-kidnapping-federal-charges), [DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/07/17/mexican-illegal-alien-charged-orchestrating-kidnapping-hoax))   
([Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-warns-of-criminals-posing-as-ice-urges-agents-to-id-themselves/))



# 3. The Allentown “grandfather deported to his death” story (July 2025)

Claim:   
A Guatemalan-American grandfather was “secretly deported,” ignored when he said he was a citizen, and later “found dead.” Viral sob-story videos circulated for days.

Reality:   
None of it was real. No matching person, no matching operation, no deportation. It was traced back to anonymous activist accounts using stock photos.

Debunk:   
DHS publicly stated there was no such case.

([DHS](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/04/30/100-days-fighting-fake-news), [Factually](https://factually.co/fact-checks/politics/us-citizens-deported-by-ice-2025-7759e0), [NY Post](https://nypost.com/2025/07/23/us-news/grandpa-who-was-secretly-deported-by-ice-is-a-hoax-feds/?utm_campaign=nypost&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter))



# 4. Hawaii “coffee shop raid targeting citizens” (May 2025)

Claim:   
ICE supposedly stormed coffee shops and detained U.S. citizen baristas for “looking foreign.”

Reality:   
Every target was a non-citizen with serious criminal convictions (kidnapping, assault, drug charges, etc). Any citizens who were temporarily detained in the chaos were released after ID verification. No one was deported.

Debunk:   
DHS called the framing misleading and pointed out the criminal history of the actual targets.

Additional:   
Failed talking head (Don Lemon) seems to actually be advocating for armed resistance to ICE/DHS ([X](https://x.com/AndrewKolvet/status/1978923877032960172))

([DHS 1](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/01/dhs-debunks-new-york-times-false-reporting-dhs-does-not-deport-us-citizens), [DHS 2](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/05/14/new-york-times-reporting-fails-mention-ice-arrests-criminal-illegal-aliens-charged))  


# 5. “ICE tried to deport a Native American woman” (November 2025)

Claim:   
Viral posts said ICE attempted to deport a Native American grandmother after a jail mix-up.

Reality:   
The detainer was accidentally issued by the county jail for the wrong inmate. ICE never took custody. Once her identity was confirmed, the situation was corrected.

Debunk:   
DHS stated flatly that she was never in ICE custody at all.

([AZPM](https://news.azpm.org/p/news-articles/2025/11/17/227283-arizona-tribal-member-nearly-deported-after-iowa-jail-issues-ice-detainer-by-mistake/))

  
**The bigger pattern**

Most of these stories fall into one of three buckets:

* key facts missing (voluntary departure framed as forced)
* local/jail errors blamed on ICE
* entirely made-up narratives packaged for maximum outrage

Meanwhile, the corrections barely travel compared to the initial viral claims.

I am usually all tired, unable to work but still don't feel sleepy for 40-50 minutes while lying on the bed many times and then no deep sleep for hours sometimes.
It's been a chronic thing ashas been happening for more than 5-6 months now.
The thing is I will sleep at 4-5 Am sometimes and will still wake up at 7:30-8:30 and won't feel sleep throughout day.
No I would expect to have a good sleep next night but nooo I will not feel sleepy at all.
I used to think it may be coffee ?? So I have stopped coffee intake completely for 3 weeks now.
I just sleep too less for 3-4 days straight, not intentionally and then good part is I sleep like a donkey for a night, but it happens like for a day then sleep hour will decrease and decrease to sometimes even 2 hours, usually 3-4 hours, and then stay like that for 3-4 days and then back to sleeping like a donkey for a day.

Also it could be that my nervous system is over activated being a young adult almost, also just to mention, I was emotionally very stressed till recently, now it's a lil better but academic stress is still there.
Not to forget, my mother had severe insomnia once, even now it's there but not that severe.

So Could it be a pre insomnia and how can I fix it ?

Mild and I was able to medicate immediately so it only had me exhausted on Sunday,  lol!  After I made her breakfast and cleaned up and my husband left for the day, my daughter and her significant other came to the living room to sit with her while I went to lay down.  They don't want to watch little house on the Prarie (been running on our TV non stop for over three years because that's all MIL wants to watch and she has a tantrum if we watch something else) so they brought in thier steam decks to game together.  
So, shes been getting mean as hell with me, but I just ignore her. Mostly snide comments under her breath and calling me a fatass. Im not, I just got diagnosed with diabetes and somehow that means im fat. Whatever because shes 309 lbs herself. But the kids had been telling me that shes said some horrid things to them, and I admit I thought they were exaggerating.  Well, friends,  she forgot I was still there in another room and started calling my daughters significant other (trans and lives with us because no family) fat and ugly when she told her there was no more coffee for her (which i had told her 15 minutes before going to bed) then my MIL told her to kill herself.  She also threw something which I discovered to be an emery board.  My daughter shouted back at her to be nice, and MIL told her to find a real man or kill herself.  
I got up and sent the kids out. Then I admit I yelled at my MIL. She cried. I don't feel bad. 
She said she doesn't want me to leave her. That made me feel bad. 
Thats my only relief if I need to go to the Dr or anything and now I don't want to leave them with her. It was nasty and inappropriate behavior from her and im worried that it's going to get worse.

For the last four weeks I have been in the worst slump of my entire life, it has been unlike anything I have experienced before. I am so low, unmotivated and I have binge eaten. I have gained a lot of scale weight and I feel very ashamed. 

I have had a very intense realisation that the burnout I am experiencing is a direct result of the past several months and a YO-YO effect. It is a direct result of the all of nothing mentality I’ve had for years. 

It has taken 29 years for me to realise this way of thinking is toxic, unhealthy and will inevitably end in deep failure. 

I need to change and I need to find balance in my life. I want to try and rewire my brain by having some chocolate and then going to the gym, or not thinking I’ve ruined the day because I had syrup in my coffee, or thinking I have failed for not doing an intense workout and only going for a walk.

Tooth infection made true diagnosis difficult. Had antibiotics (clindamycin) for tooth infection and stomach pain went away but now it’s back. Took 6 months for h pylori suggestion, negative stool tests. Some weeks good, some weeks bad depending on what I eat. Broccoli sprouts help. Waiting for GI. Is it typical to have good and bad h pylori weeks depending on diet?? 


I have had a roller coaster of a year! I found out that I had a tooth infection. I had been having heart palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, so I assumed those symptoms were related to that. Then one day, about a month after the tooth diagnosis, I started having a burning pain in my stomach accompanied with dizziness and horrible anxiety. I ended up at the ER, and I told them about my tooth infection (surgery was scheduled but I had to wait a month!!!) ! The ER gave me clindamycin, thinking that my symptoms were related to the tooth. I took clindamycin for a month, and I remember day one my stomach pain and anxiety disappeared along with everything else! 

Got my tooth removed and stopped anti biotics. About 3 weeks later, my stomach symptoms and dizziness were back, along with ear ringing . I would wake up in the middle of the night and think I was dying due to extreme dry mouth, dizziness, rapid heart rate, and stomach pain. 

Finally got in to see a primary care doc, and she mentioned possible h pylori, which was a relief to learn about because it explained all my symptoms. Negative on both stool tests bc I was taking pepto bismol and the docs didn’t tell me they would cause a false positive. Refused to give me a breath test for some reason, and now I am just waiting for a referral to the GI for an endoscopy. 

I have good weeks and bad weeks. It seems my symptoms are maybe not as severe as others on here, as I’m able to manage the worst of my symptoms with supplements and diet (including broccoli sprouts). Just when I think I’m all better, I’ll take a sip of wine or have a cup of coffee, only to be right back at square one for 4-7 days. Is this a typical pattern of this illness??

It’s the same loop every few years of the same people sharing links of news articles saying “DOGE TO HIT $10” that freak out, sell low and share the articles “THE CRYPTO MARKET IS OVER” when there’s any substantial hit to the market.

And guess what, as I sip my coffee on this Monday morning watching all the people freaking out, I’m just intently watching our favourite coin plummet to below 10c before buying another 400,000 of those suckers at a discount price you wouldn’t find on the high street in January all thanks to the panic mongering from the same people who say they support the coin.

Play your cards right, keep your head (in good and bad times) and maybe then you’ll understand. There is no getting out, you’re either in it or you’re not. Holding a coin for 2 months and selling after losing 50% of its value is nobodies fault but your own.

Seattle’s and New York City’s socialist mayors-elect joined an “[open-ended](https://sbworkersunited.org/our-strike/)” strike against Starbucks this week. The protest pickets what the organizer, Starbucks Workers United, calls unfair labor practices and has said is in [solidarity](https://x.com/SBWorkersUnited/status/1966911285255442567) with Palestinians.

“While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us,” stated Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect who has said he would have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested if he comes to the Big Apple.

“Together, we can send a powerful message,” he [said](https://x.com/ZohranKMamdani/status/1989150195750523028). “No contract. No coffee.”

Katie Wilson, the Seattle mayor-elect who has accused Israel of “genocide,” [reportedly](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/11/14/seattle-katie-wilson-starbucks-strike/) said, “I’m not buying Starbucks, and you should not either.”

Morton Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of America, told JNS that “socialists tend to be very hostile to Jews.”

Buckle up it’s a long one, but here goes. I (29F) and my ex best friend we’ll call Mia (29F) we’re best friends all through middle school and high school. We were attached at the hip and did everything together. I was not rich by any means but my family was more well off than hers. So I always found myself buying her lunches, driving her to school, and buying her the odd thing here or there. I didn’t mind because she was always super appreciative, and always tried to get me back in her own way (giving me some of her stuff like jewelry, would help me dye my hair, and just little acts of love like that). Anyways we were tight, until we weren’t. Long story short she started dating a guy in senior year who didn’t like how close we were because I “stole all her time from him”. It would cause a lot of fights and essentially she chose him over me. It hurt but we just went our separate ways. After they broke up we tried to be friends again but it never was the same. We had a big falling out in 2017 when she blamed a lot of mental health issues on me because I moved away and couldn’t “be there to save her” like it was my responsibility.. anyways we didn’t talk until 2024. We had our high school reunion. When she showed up we had a long talk and she apologized profusely and took all the blame and explained how messed up she was back then. We proceeded to have a great night and it felt really nice to have my friend back. Over the next month or two we went out for walks and grabbed coffee together etc. playing catch up. She explained she is having a hard time basically she is single, couch surfing , not able to afford life, and having car trouble. Most importantly that she was scared she wasn’t going to be able to make rent this month and would be homeless (I however am a mom, I’m married, I own a house, and my partner and I make decent money. Again, not rich but we are very comfortable) I was feeling very generous (or stupid) and offered to lend her the money she needed. ($500) At first she was hesitant but took it. I told her no rush to it pay back. SO. The next time she visited she asked me for my email to transfer me. I gave it to her but two weeks went by and I didn’t get any emt? So I was getting worried and messaged her worried it didn’t go through, she put the wrong email, who knows. She blew up. It was a weekend past her birthday and she lost it at me saying she was out celebrating when I messaged her and absolutely ruined her night. She started crying at the bar and embarrassed herself in-front of all her friends. I tried to tell her I didn’t know she was out, and she could’ve just talked to me the next day. And how she reacts isn’t my fault I was just concerned I didn’t get anything she said she was sending. Anyways. Again a couple months later she came back and apologized for how she reacted and wanted to hang out. So she came over and we had a nice afternoon. She was telling me she was living with family because she got kicked out of her place but her family is very toxic and she’s trying to move away. She’s always tried to ask my advice on things like finances and stuff because she can’t get her life together. So I made a suggestion to her that , yes I know her family is toxic but maybe it’d be worth it to stay there for just a little while she tries and get her GED so she can get a decent job(she always complains she gets very low paying jobs because she doesn’t have her high school diploma). Well she lost it. Basically saying that her family causes such mental issues she can’t stay there and I’m horrible for suggesting that and I just don’t understand. She basically said she doesn’t want to talk to me about life anymore and has completely stopped talking to me. She won’t answer my texts or calls. It’s been like 7 months. I still have her on Facebook and I am not blocked on her number, she just ignores me. But a huge part of me wants to block her myself for being a toxic friend who I frankly don’t want in my life. But I DO WANT MY $500 BACK! I worry blocking her will end the chances of me ever seeing that $500 again she borrowed over a year ago now, but also I highly doubt I will anyways. AITA?

I really need experienced input.","**UPDATE** ([original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/greatdanes/comments/1oehoxv/fostering_to_adopt_6_mo_great_dane_fawnequin/)):   
  
**TLDR:** I’ve been fostering a 7-month-old Great Dane for \~3 weeks. She was abandoned in the desert and is honestly a *dream* in so many ways — extremely smart, eager to learn, responsive to training, sleeps through the night, and overall very sweet.

I’m **not** overwhelmed or “done” with her. I adore her. But I’m seeing some behavior patterns that make me question whether my home is the right **long-term fit** for her development — and I need objective advice from people who know Danes / working or protective breeds / multi-dog households / rural setups.

# 🔍 The 4 issues I’m trying to understand (realistic concerns or catastrophizing?)

# 1️⃣ Early protectiveness toward me

She was totally fine with people in neutral spaces until last week. Now she has barked, lunged, and tried to body-block when strangers (including a maintenance worker’s kids) approach me *in our space*.

At the vet last week she started growling at anyone who came near us and raised her hackles at the tech when they called us back — but calmed once she realized everyone was friendly.

We live **extremely rurally** (no foot traffic, very few visitors), so I can’t naturally create a steady flow of “people coming and going.”

➡️ **Reality check:** Does this tend to escalate as Danes mature (100+ lbs), even with training/socialization, simply because of environment?

# 2️⃣ Rough play + my very small dogs

She *loves* my 7 lb and 14 lb dogs… but her play is way too rough. Zero malice — just no size awareness. She can be gentle and then suddenly puppy-snap, grab, or paw at faces. One wrong move could hurt the 7-lb dog.

We currently do **constant leash + baby gate management** and never let them loose together.

➡️ **Reality check:** Can a Dane eventually learn to safely play with toy breeds, or is this always high-risk, high-management?

# 3️⃣ Separation distress + working from home

She sleeps through the night in her crate, but during the day she struggles to be away from me for more than 3–5 minutes. We’re doing crate games, place training, frozen Kongs, etc. She settles when she *thinks* I’m going to sleep — but not if she knows I’m awake and moving around the house.

➡️ **Reality check:** Do most households successfully work through this without sacrificing jobs/relationships/mental health, or is this level of intensity temporary but normal?

# 4️⃣ The rural-socialization problem

Everything I read says preventing protective/reactive behavior in giant breeds requires **lots of visitors and positive exposure to different people entering the home**.  
I don’t have that unless I actively *recruit* people to come over constantly.

I can do social outings once her vaccines kick in (coffee shops, Home Depot, trails, etc.) — but I’m not sure that solves the “protective of the home/person” issue.

➡️ **Reality check:** Is rural living workable for a Dane with protective tendencies, or am I setting her up for reactivity no matter how hard I try?

# ⚖️ What I’m really trying to figure out

I need help separating:

* **fear vs. foresight**
* **catastrophizing vs. responsible planning**
* **“I’m overwhelmed” vs. “this is a mismatch”**

I don’t want to keep her if it’s not objectively fair to *her development*, and I don’t want to rehome her if we’re still well within “normal challenges.”

# ❌ What I’m not asking for

* guilt or praise
* “just hire a trainer” (I have one coming Friday; vaccines aren’t complete yet so training centers are a no-go)

# 💬 What I am asking for

If you’ve lived through similar dynamics — especially with **Danes, guardian-type breeds, rural environments, reactivity prevention, or mixed small/large dog households** — I would love your input on whether this sounds like:

**A)** Totally normal challenges that many people successfully work through with time

**or**

**B)** Early indicators that she would thrive better long-term in a home with:

* more foot traffic / suburban or urban environment

# ❤️ Final note

I love this dog. I want what’s best for her long-term — not just what hurts less for me emotionally in the moment. I’m willing to put in real work if this is the right home for her. I’m also willing to step aside if the fairest thing for her is a different setup.

Thank you in advance to anyone willing to weigh in with nuance and experience. This is genuinely one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever had to make and it comes this week during the one year anniversary of losing my soul dog, a Pyrenees-mix, last November — so feeling all the emotions and trying my hardest to think clearly (on little sleep and fully puppy management mode).",18,1763407404.0,greatdanes,3,0.96,False

But what are Shamans if not keepers of stories and the spinner of tales!?

This was a long time ago, (in context my grandmother had recently passed away, followed by my mother a month later.) I've since healed from this :)... So no worries.

The dream or ""Vision"" I was walking along a river bed found and ate a mushroom the next moment I was floating down the river, in twilight I just relaxed and allowed the current to take me, I remember vividly touching grass floating in the water and looking at ferns along the bank.

I washed up onto the river bank beneath this massive, very ancient willow tree. And as I lay there for a moment their appeared above me a elderly woman's face in the tree, and she and I spoke for a very long time. I felt a calm wash over me and the sun had rose and the twilight gave way to sharp rays of sunlight breaking thru the canopy. So I wandered away from the river following a trail to what I knew to be our downtown area, but it looked completely different.

I went into the coffee shop we all liked to hangout at. And I encountered my group of friends, they all knew me and I knew them, but they were all strangers to me really. And I was just marveling at all the differences in this place compared to the one I knew, details were very vivid and sharp. And I remember having tea, or coffee in a window seat, (my spot) and looking out the glass at the faces of people passing by.

While our small group of friends were leaving a little girl and her grandmother walked in, they passed us as as I was exiting the glass doors I heard her say or whisper to her grandmother, ""Was that an Angel??"" And I saw the grandmothers eyes look at her then glance at me as the door closed.

I was pulled along by this one friend who has appeared multiple times in different dreams, she appears every time as a short black haired blue eyed, goth style woman. And she as far as I can tell is a dreamwalker/entity or real person I have not met yet.

Anyway we walked thru downtown again I marveled at the similar yet vastly different buildings. We made it back to the river, and it was just me again and there was a flowing section of the river cascading over the rocks that was just beautiful. I stared at that spot zoned out and woke up.

I am currently building out a mobile espresso cart, and my county permitting indicates that I need a handwash sink with combination hot/cold faucet, and that all equipment must be NSF or ANSI certified.

Ideally, I'd get [some version of this](https://prima-coffee.com/equipment/prima-coffee/sink-kit-prima-bp) Ready Hot water heater, but looking at the specs it's really only the sink that is 'NSF Certified' and the water heater is 'NSF Compliant' as stated by UL.

We want to do a small test batch to see if the product works, get some traction, and use that to get funding for a bigger batch at a lower cost.

  
Problem is, we want the [8oz sleek](https://www.crowncork.com/beverage-packaging/products/beverage-cans/8oz-237-ml-crownsleek) or [7.5oz sleek](https://www.crowncork.com/beverage-packaging/products/beverage-cans/75oz-222ml-crownsleek) can, and almost none of the copackers offer it.  Either they DO have that can---but no retort processing (which we need)---- or, they DO have retort processing--but not in that can size.  Or if they do BOTH-- their MOQs are like 100,000.

Basically just a shot in the dark here, hoping someone has a tip on a smaller facility that's 1) able to do retort processing, 2)does a variety of (small) can sizes, and 3)is able to do a test batch of under 10,000 units.

1ozpgir,https://www.reddit.com/r/BackwoodsCreepy/comments/1ozpgir/scary_stories_from_the_woods_from_grandpa_and/,Scary stories from the woods from Grandpa and Grandma. Part3,"Helllo y’all, here’s Part 3 of these old stories from Grandpa and Granny about what lives up in these West Virginia mountains. I done posted two before this if you wanna go back and read them, but you don’t really need ‘em for this one—it stands on its own.

As always, drop your questions, guesses, whatever. I love readingg ‘em.

Soä one time I was over at my uncle’s place and he let slip something about “Snowmen.” I was like, “Uncle, what in the hell’s a Snowman?” He just grunted and said he didn’t feel like getting into it right then.  
Next thing I know, Grandpa comes stumping 
. .
 through the door, pours hisself a cup of blacker’n-midnight coffee, eases down in his chair like his back’s killing him, looks at me and says,  
“Well boy, you wanna know what the Quiet Hunters really are? Sit still and listen close. My granddad taught me this ‘fore he passed in ‘23.”

He said the Quiet Hunters ain’t ghosts of dead folks and they sure ain’t demons crawled up outta hell. They was here long afore the first Shawnee or Cherokee ever set foot in these mountains. ten thousand years ago, maybe longer. Old-timers called ‘em the First Watchers or just “the ones that never speak.” They belong to the land itself, same as the rock and the ice. Folks say they’re what’s left when a winter gets so mean and cold the line between livin’ and dead thins out like wet paper.

First time a bunch of outsiders really noticed ‘em was durin’ the War Between the States. Desertin’ soldiers and runaways hid out way up high—Dolly Sods, Roaring Plains, Canaan Heights, all them places. They built campfires ‘cause they’d freeze solid otherwise… and that’s what got ‘em took. The Quiet Hunters can’t stand fire and they hate loud human voices in deep winter. Army reports don’t say nothin’ about it. officers just wrote it off as hillbilly superstition—but the folks who lived here knew better. Whole squads of men flat disappeared in the winters of ‘62 and ‘63. No bodies, no blood, not even tracks in the snow most times. Just every now and then a pair of boots set neat side-by-side or a rifle laid careful on the ground like the feller meant to come back for it. Mountain people say the Quiet Hunters “carried ‘em home”—not outta meanness, but ‘cause them boys broke the old bargain and disturbed the silence.
Grandpa said his granddad seen one hisself just a second right at the edge of a blizzard. Thing was tall as two men standin’ on each other’s shoulders, shoulders wide as an ox yoke, but where a face oughta be there was nothin’ but black empty. And the snow never sank under its feet, like it didn’t weigh a damn thing.

Worst part, though? The breath. When one of ‘em’s close, the cold quits bitin’. Your breath don’t freeze no more it hangs there in a little white cloud right in front of your face… then it starts drifting slow toward the Hunter, like it’s showing him the way straight to you. That’s why the old folks boarded up the windows with quilts in winter and breathed real shallow if they had to step outside after dark. And if somebody coughed too loud or snored like a sawmill… well, come morning sometimes that bed was empty.

Grandpa got real quiet at the end and said,  
“They don’t come every year. But when that first snow hits in October and the north wind blows in dead empty no birds, no deer, nothing then I know they’re walking again. And I don’t crack a window, not even a hair. ‘Cause they’re patient. Lord, they’re patient.”

What do I do?,"I used to be the type of person who could crank out tasks like a little productivity gremlin with a coffee IV. Now? I’ll sit down at my desk, open my laptop, and suddenly my brain decides to play dead. I’m not even procrastinating with something fun, just staring at the screen like a confused NPC.

Here’s the weird part:  
I want to get things done. I think about the tasks constantly. I make lists. I reorganize those lists. I rewrite the same to-do items 12 times. But actually starting? It feels like trying to push a car with one arm. I don’t know if it’s burnout, decision fatigue, dopamine depletion, or just my villain origin story, but I’m so tired of this cycle. My space is clean, my goals are clear, my schedule is open… yet my brain refuses to cooperate.

1ozpbzp,https://i.redd.it/nyv3dhtp9v1g1.jpeg,How would you (politely) respond to a neighbor complaining about rooster noise in a rural area?,"I have two flocks at the moment, a larger one toward the back of my 4 acre property and a small bantam flock/chick raising area next to my hoyse, roughly in the middle of my property. I have 3 roosters in the large flock and 2 in the small one. My neighborhood is agriculturally zoned and lots of people have animals so you can hear sheep, goats, chickens, peacocks, and of course dogs at any time. My neighbor who lives across the street through some small woods messaged me asking when I would be eating the roosters in the small coop because they sound like they are ""right in her yard"" every morning. She can't hear them in her house and it's not like they're crowing at odd hours, just during the day. It sounds like she simply doesn't like hearing them while shes sitting outside enjoying her morning coffee. I may cull 1 of the 2  roosters at some point but not any time soon and the 1 would still crow since he does it back and forth with roosters from the larger flock. I lost a lot of chickens to disease this year and I like having the option to make more chickens without buying from a hatchery... I also have closer neighbors and they have yet to complain about, but half of them currently have or have owned farm animals so I doubt they care. Not really sure what to tell her since there will always be noise from that coop but I understand it can be annoying to hear when you're trying to relax outside.",27,1763406781.0,BackYardChickens,23,1.0,False

1ozpbot,https://www.reddit.com/r/AubreyMaturinSeries/comments/1ozpbot/this_duel_and_the_buildup_of_tension_leading_to/,This duel and the buildup of tension leading to it is one of the crowning passages of the series. A massive payoff for those who followed Stephen’s arc from the beginning.,"
Mealy-Mouth, he observed, was a water-drinker; but Stephen, having taken a sip of the local wine, could hardly blame him for that. Immediately opposite was a big, dark-faced man, as big as Jack Aubrey or even bigger; he wore regimentals that Stephen did not recognize, presumably those of the Rum Corps. His very large face had a look of stupidity and settled ill-temper; he wore a surprising number of rings. To this man's right sat the clergyman who had said grace, and he too looked thoroughly discontented. His face was unusually round; it was red, and growing steadily redder. From the confusion of voices and the unfamiliarity of their topics it was not easy for Stephen to make out more than the general drift at first, but that was clear enough from the often-repeated 'United Irish-men' and 'Defenders' - prisoners who had been transported in large num-bers, particularly after the 1798 rising in Ireland. 

He noticed that the Scottish officers of the Seventy-Third did not take part, but they were in the minority and the general feeling was well summed up by the clergyman, who said, 'The Irish do not deserve the appellation of men. And if I needed an authority for the statement I should bring forward Governor Collins of Van Diemen's Land. Those are his very words: in the second volume of his book, I believe. But no authority is needed for what is evident to the meanest understanding. And now to crown all, priests are allowed them. A cunning priest can make them do anything; and there is nothing but anarchy to be foreseen.' 

‘Who is that gentleman?' asked Stephen in a low voice, Hamlyn having finished with horse-racing for the moment.

'His name is Marsden, said Ham-lyn. 'A wealthy sheep-farmer and a magistrate at Parramatta: and once he is on to the poor old Pope and popery he never leaves off.'

How true. Stephen saw Tom Pullings' bored face, fixed in a dutiful smile, near the head of the table, on Colonel MacPherson's right; and at the same time Tom looked at him - a very anxious look.

'I beg your pardon,' said the penal secretary. 'I am shamefully remiss: allow me to help you to a little of this dish. It is kangaroo, our local venison.'

'You are very good, sir,' said Stephen, looking at it with some inter-est. 'Can you tell me ...'

But Firkins was already away on a hobbyhorse of his own, the poverty of Ireland and its inevitability. His words were mostly addressed to the other side of the table, though when he had finished his account he turned to Stephen and said, 'They are not unlike our Aborigines, sir, the most feckless people in the world. If you give them sheep they will not wait for them to breed and grow into a flock: they eat them at once. Poverty, dirt and ignorance must necessarily attend them.'

'Did you ever read in Bede, sir?' asked Stephen.

'Bede? I do not think I know the
name. Was he a legal writer?'

'I believe he is chiefly known for his ecclesiastical history of the English nation.

'Ah, then Mr Marsden will know him. Mr Marsden, - raising his voice - ‘do you know of a Mr Bede, that wrote an ecclesiastical history?'

'Bede? Bede?' said Marsden, breaking off his conversation with his neighbour. 'Never heard of him. Then resuming it, 'He was a mere boy, so we only gave him a hundred lashes on the back, and the rest on his bottom and legs.'

'Bede lived in the County Durham,' said Stephen in a momentary pause.

'Little do I or other naturalists know of the northern parts of England; but it is to be hoped that some future fau-nist, a person of a thinking turn of mind, a man of fortune, will under-take the tour, accompanied by a botanist and a draughtsman, and will give us an account of his journey. The manners of the wild Aborigines, their superstitions, their prejudices, their sordid way of life, will extort from him many useful reflections. And his draughtsman will portray the ruins of the great monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow, the home of the most learned man in England a thousand years ago, famous throughout the Christian world and now forgotten. Such a work would be well received.’

Perhaps: the remark, however, was received in disapproving silence, with puzzled, suspicious looks; and eventually the big man opposite Stephen said, 'There ain't any Aborigines in Durham. 

While the learned explained to him what might be meant by the word, Stephen said inwardly 'Let me not be a fool. God preserve me from choler,' and a flow of talk from the upper end of the table swept the incident into the past.

'I am so sorry,' he said, suddenly aware that Hamlyn was speaking to him. I was wool-gathering again. I was contemplating on sheep.'

'And I was talking to you about sheep, how droll, said Hamlyn. 'I was telling you that your vis-a-vis, Captain Lowe, has imported some of the Saxony merinos to make a new cross.'

'Has he a great many sheep?'

'Probably more than anyone else. It is said he is the richest man in the colony.

The Flogging Parson, his face redder still, had begun savaging the Pope again, and to shut him out Stephen replied in a louder voice, 'Curiously enough it was merinos that I was thinking of, the King's merinos; they are of the Spanish breed, however.'

'Are you talking about merinos?' asked Captain Lowe.
'Yes,' said Hamlyn. 'Dr Maturin here has seen the King's flock.'

'Sir Joseph Banks was good enough to show them to me, said Stephen.

Lowe looked at him with contempt, and after some thought replied, 'I don't give a ... a button for Sir Joseph Banks.'

'I am sure he would be grieved to hear it.'

‘Why did he try to prevent Captain Macarthur getting any of the King's sheep? Because Macarthur was from the colony, I suppose?’

'Surely not. Sir Joseph has always had the interests of the colony very much at heart. It was largely his influence that brought it into being, you will recall.'

'Then why did he refuse to receive Macarthur?'

'I cannot suppose that he thought a man with Captain Macarthur's antecedents a desirable acquain-tance,' said Stephen in a silence broken only by Colonel MacPherson's long-continuing, even-toned account of the Nawab of Oudh. 

'Furthermore, Sir Joseph strongly objects to duels, on moral grounds; and Captain Macarthur was in London to be court-martialled for engaging in one.’ 

Lowe did not seem to hear the later words. At the first he flushed a dull red and he said no more until the end of the meal, only muttering 'Undesir-able acquaintance' from time to time, much as Stephen muttered within himself 'God give me patience. Dear Mother of God give me patience, for the railing about Irish prisoners had begun again, as tedious as the railing of European women about domestic servants but infinitely more malig-nant.
By the time they retired for tea and coffee Stephen had, in spite of his deliberate abstraction, heard as much as he could bear; there was a pressure of contained anger that made his hand tremble so that the coffee spilt into its saucer. Yet now came a pleasant interlude: he walked on the draw-ing-room terrace smoking a cigar and talking to two well-bred, interesting, Gaellic-speaking Hebridean officers of the Seventy-Third, and the tension diminished somewhat.

He and Pullings took their leave of Colonel MacPherson, and while the Colonel kept Pullings back to tell him that he was sorry Captain Aubrey had not been able to come, that although he had official letters for him they could not be given into any hands but his own, and that he would be well advised to take a couple of pints of rice-water, just luke-warm, Stephen walked into the narrow room where the officers put on their swords. There were few left, Tom's regulation lion-headed affair, three with basket-hilts belonging to the Highlanders, and his own. He buckled it on and walked down the steps into pleasant fresh-ness; and standing there on the gravel he saw Captain Lowe, who said to him, 'I don't give a bugger for Joe Banks; and I don't give a bugger for you either, you half-baked sod of a ship's surgeon.’ He spoke very loud and hoarse and two or three officers turned.

Stephen looked at him attentively. The man was in a choking rage but he was perfectly steady on his feet; he was not drunk. 'Will you answer for that, sir?' he asked.

'There's my answer,' said the big man, with a blow that knocked Stephen's wig from his head.

Stephen leapt back, whipped out his sword and cried, 'Draw, man, draw, or I shall stick you like a hog.

Lowe unsheathed his sabre: little good did it do him. In two hissing passes his right thigh was ploughed up. At the third Stephen's sword was through his shoulder. And at the issue of a confused struggle at close quarters he was flat on his back, Stephen's foot on his chest, Stephen's sword-point at his throat and the cold voice saying above him, 'Ask my pardon or you are a dead man. Ask my pardon, I say, or you are a dead man, a dead man.'

'I ask your pardon,' said Lowe, and his eyes filled with blood.",29,1763406763.0,AubreyMaturinSeries,9,1.0,False

1ozpb5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1ozpb5w/pharaoh_ants_nothing_works/,Pharaoh Ants - Nothing Works!,"Hi everyone! Long time reader, first time poster (literally my first reddit post ever) so I apologize if this is the incorrect subreddit or if this has been asked before. But I am at a complete loss about the Pharaoh Ant infestation going on in my apartment and I need help from a community of experts. 

For some background, I live in a high rise (50th floor) studio apartment of a building built in the 60s in downtown Chicago. It is made of concrete, even the walls are masonry which makes drilling difficult. I own my apartment and the building has an HOA. Since everyone here owns their space, the only service provided to us by the HOA is an exterminator on site twice a month that you have to put your name on a list for whenever needed. Everyone on the list is always for the same issue, the pharaoh ants. I am currently on that list indefinitely until this is figured out.  

I moved in 14 months ago and ever since the pharaoh ants have been a problem. I keep a very clean space but I still see at least 3-5 ants a day, but randomly they explode and I see hundreds. I do not use Raid or Terro on them, just the Max Force baits that the exterminator supplies and whatever commercial products he brings along with him to his visits. That is usually Advion gel and lately a new spray that I have not seen before. I keep the baits in areas I often see the ants like behind my oven and under my sink but still in the past month the ants have gotten WAY worse. 

After being away from my apartment for less than 24 hours, I came home to find they had taken over my coffee maker, which was already on mini furniture risers that had double sided tape on the bottom edges, & in my dishwasher which was clean. I have done various (borderline excessive and inconvenient) “hacks” like this to try to at least keep the ants away from my kitchen appliances. I previously had my air fryer on top of a baking sheet that had Aquaphor around the edges & on the plug/cord which was just a huge pain in an already very small kitchen. At this point aside from the coffee maker I keep basically nothing on my counters. I clean them daily and use vinegar as well. I’ve tried peppermint oil on cotton pads or even adding peppermint oil to my water & vinegar mixture but nothing seems to help. All of my food is in air tight containers or ziploc bags, even things like honey, yet I still find them in my cabinets. I consistently mop and vacuum so there is no food on the floors. But I know a big part of the problem is they love moisture which is basically impossible to be completely rid of in a kitchen or bathroom. Recently I also found some on my dresser which is crazy because there’s no food or water there & it is far from the kitchen. 

What else can I do? Are there any other Pharoah Ant tips and tricks? Should I go to the HOA and ask them to have the exterminator treat the entire building? There’s over 300 units and the exterminator said he told them they need to do it but they refuse. Twice monthly exterminator visits just aren’t enough anymore. If my neighbors aren’t properly combatting this issue, it will continue to get worse. I know the unit next door to me has been vacant since I moved in so I have no clue what’s going on in there but my kitchen & bathroom are part of our shared wall. My kitchen has become basically unusable and I don’t want to have to throw away and buy a new coffee maker just for this to potentially happen again. This is becoming an expensive problem that seems to have no end in sight!

Thank you in advance for any advice you can provide! I’m out of ideas! I am worried they will eventually migrate into my living/sleeping area and they’re so small & hard to see I really don’t want that happening. Again, apologies if this is the incorrect subreddit to post this so if there is a better one please let me know!",1,1763406728.0,pestcontrol,2,1.0,False

The BYU Cougars and Cincinnati Bearcats are set for a November 22 showdown that’s as much about pride as it is about playoff positioning. Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might end with someone needing a stiff drink and a recount.

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The betting market is as clear as a post-game press conference after a blowout. DraftKings, FanDuel, and the rest of the bookie crew have BYU as a -2.5-point favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.77 for BYU** and **2.1 for Cincinnati**. Converting that to implied probabilities? BYU’s 56.5% chance to win vs. Cincinnati’s 47.6%. It’s not a landslide, but it’s enough to suggest the Cougars are the safer bet—unless you’ve bet on “Cincinnati pulls off a miracle while wearing traffic cones as helmets.”

The total is set at **54.5 points**, with Over/Under odds nearly even. Given BYU’s 447-yard performance against TCU and Cincinnati’s 30-24 loss to Arizona, this feels like a “high-scoring thriller” or “defensive clinic” coin flip. Bet on the Over if you trust your coffee to keep you awake; Under if you’ve seen BYU’s defense sleepwalk through third-down conversions.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

**BYU** enters this game riding a wave of redemption. After a brutal 29-7 loss to Texas Tech, they steamrolled TCU 44-13, holding the Horned Frogs to a measly 298 yards and forcing two interceptions. Their defense? A well-oiled machine that’s suddenly as fun to watch as a toddler with a new toy. QB Keanu Tanuvasa (assuming he’s the one with the clipboard) and company are cooking with gas, needing just two more wins to secure a Big 12 title shot.

**Cincinnati**, meanwhile, is trying to forget their 30-24 upset loss to Arizona, where QB Brendan Sorsby threw two picks and looked like he’d rather be anywhere but Tucson. The Bearcats’ offense? A rollercoaster of inconsiste

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Stanford Cardinal vs. California Golden Bears: A Tale of Two Turkeys with a Side of Tomfoolery**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a gridiron clash that’s less *Monday Night Football* and more *Monday Morning Coffee Spill*—Stanford (3-7) hosts California (6-4) in a November showdown where the only thing more chaotic than the Cardinal’s offense is the implied probability of this game not ending in a tie. Let’s break it down with the precision of a QB who doesn’t throw picks… unlike Stanford’s Ben Gulbranson, who’s tossed 10 interceptions this season (a stat so惨 it makes a catatonic goldfish look coordinated).

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Statistical Farce

First, the numbers. Cal’s offense ranks 104th in FBS (341.9 yards/game) but 34th in passing (262.7 yards), which is like being “okay at baking a cake but great at frosting it.” Their QB, Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele, is a statistical titan: 2,510 yards, 13 TDs, and a 61.4% completion rate. Stanford? They’re 122nd in total offense (307.4 yards/game) and 135th in rushing (75.9 yards). Their QB, Gulbranson, has a 56.9% completion rate but 10 picks—proof that Stanford’s offense is less “Air Attack” and more “Air Traffic Control.”

Defensively, Cal allows 354.9 yards/game (54th) but is stingy against the run (155.4 yards, 82nd). Stanford’s defense? A sieve with a 407.7-yard average allowed (104th) and a 29.1-point average given up (97th). If Stanford’s defense were a cheese grater, it’d grate your bones.

**Odds Deep Dive**: The lines have Cal as a 3-point favorite (decimal odds: 1.67 for Cal, 2.24 for Stanford). Converting to implied probabilities: Cal’s 59.8% chance vs. Stanford’s 44.6%. The public loves Cal, but the spread is tight—probably because Stanford’s “defense” is just a group of students pretending to tackle for the Instagram.

Historical Context 

I was in an abusive relationship/marriage for 23 years. I finally left him and healed (except for my attachment style). I left him in July 2022 an divorce was final in Feb 2023.  I dated a bit and had a 6 month relationship with another toxic guy. That ended April 2024.  I took more time to heal realizing I was still attracting the wrong type of person.  While doing the healing in August of 2024 I met the guy that this post is about. Let's refer to him as E. 
When I met E. he had all the requirements that I needed and wanted in a man. Educated funny very intelligent geeky, somewhat reserved, caring emotionally intelligent etc. 

From the moment we met, E. was honest. He told me he's reading self help books and wants to improve himself. He had a shallow marriage but he wants to have a deeper connection. But He always said he doesn't know what he wants. He was only separated for 6 months and was still living at home with his ex and kids. And that I was only the 3rd woman he's ever dated in his life (ex wife and 1 gf before marriage) I knew right away I shouldn't proceed. I knew I wanted a relationship and him saying he doesn't know what he wants made it clear we probably don't have a future. However, I was too intrigued and happy to have met someone like him. Someone mostly ""normal"" and ""healthy"". So against my better judgement I continued dating him. Things went well for the 1st few months. We developed a great mental, emotional and physical connection. The best I've ever had in all aspects. But at the back of my mind I always wondered when it will end, making me anxious. Towards the end of 3 months, his ex started asking about what we are or where this is going. And after the most amazing weekend where he showed me he cares a lot about me, 3 days later he initiated the end.  He said he started to feel he was falling into an accidental relationship the way he sort of went along with the marriage, not being a proactive chooser in his life.  He said he wants to get back on the dating apps but he still wants to see me and have things be the same. I agreed mostly out of being blindsided ( not sure why I was he always told me he was confused) anyway a few days later I told him I can't do that and that we have to actually break up. We cried and he told me that I'm someone who has everything he's ever wanted in a person but that he's not sure he could be that lucky that the 1st person he dated after his separation would be the one. During the breakup he told me that through his own healing he realized he's emotionally avoidant and that he has to work on himself. But he did say that our connection was the best he's ever had in every way. Still we broke up. He asked to remain friends. We tried friendship for 3 months but I couldn't do it. My feelings for him kept growing as I could feel our strong connection. I never told him I loved him but he knew I had feelings. So I decided to go no contact to help me move on.  He was sad but understood that it wasn't fair for him to ask me for a friendship. He just said he hoped the no contact wouldn't be forever and that he doesn't want to lose me. He has high integrity and respect and because I was very clear I didn't want him to contact me, I knew he wouldn't break any boundaries. So we went no contact for 8 months (Feb to Nov 2025) during this time I took a lot of time with my therapist to heal and rewire my brain to break the anxious attachment style I had. I became quite confident and in Sept I went back to dating, attracting better quality man and going out. However, at the back of my mind, E. kept being there.  I realized that somehow the no contact was like a tether to him. I kept obsessing over when I should break it or being nervous I would bump into him (our kids are in the same class at school, we go to the same gym, supermarket etc) I kept avoiding places being scared to bump into him. It was bad. So I had to break it to feel free. 

I worked hard during no contact to try to get over him. Everyone kept telling me it's how he treated me that l missed, not actually him. I considered that but ultimately I'm sure it's love for him I feel. Avoidant or not, it's the man that he is today that I love. Not his potential. The other man I've been dating have made me feel similarly to how E. made me feel, yet I don't have feelings for anyone else. 

Current situation

I decided to break the no contact 3 weeks ago (Oct 27). I just wanted to let him go. I texted him a basic how have you been text feeling relief and freedom. And right away he responded telling me he's finally divorced and moved into his own place. I asked him for coffee and that weekend we met for coffee. It was awkward at first and we gave each other an awkward quick hug and started talking but after a few mins it was fine. Like talking to an old friend.  We cought up on everything in our lives but we didn't discuss dating or his self work. I went into the meeting not just to break no contact so it won't be weird if I bump into him in town but to get clarity on my own feelings for him. 

During the coffee catch-up towards the end he cought me off guard and asked if I wanted a friendship or is this was a one time catch up.  I said I'm open to a friendship if he was. He said he was and we kept talking. I cought him checking me out and he stared intensely into my eyes. I could feel the connection was there. When it was time to leave (I said I had to go) he barely moved and kept sitting talking even as I stood and put on my coat. He finally got up put on his coat but started a new topic about his pets. We stood by the table for a few mins and seeing that he's not planning on leaving I started walking towards the door and he followed. He finished his story outside and I said it was nice to see him and went in for a quick friendly side hug.  But this time he held me a little bit longer than was necessary. I pulled away said it was nice to see him. He started walking to his car telling me to text him should I have any questions (re his life etc) and I said ok. Then he went the wrong way to his car.  Away from it across the parking lot.  lol.  he seemed flustered but in a cute way lol. I pretended I didn't see that he has to backtrack to his car. I knew after this meeting that I love him and it was validating he still has something towards me. However, knowing he's an avoidant I'm threading carefully.

The few times we've texted he always initiates and I keep he convos light and logistical always leaving the convo with the ball in his court. He asked whether I want to play board games (one of our favorite activities) some time and what weekend schedule with my kids was like. I told him and he said our off (from kids) weekends lined up and that ""this will still work 😊"".  Then a week later he asked me to play pickleball. I was busy (I actually was) and told him I have a short window on Sat. We had a great time with pickleball this past sat. At the end we walked to our cars and again he lingered by my car so I went in for a quick hug but this time he held me tighter and rubbed my mid back (the way he used to before he would kiss me) I sort of twirled away and walked to my car I turned around said bye again and finally he said bye and started walking to his car. That was Sat.  I was going to send a text today (Mon) telling him thank you for the game and leave it at that. But ysterday night, he texted me telling me he had fun on Sat and if I was free the weekend after Thanksgiving as he was free the entire weekend. I haven't yet replied. But I do have some plans. 

My current analysis

E.  is highly engaged and invested in maintaining a connection, though he is still framing his intentions within the safety of ""friendship"" to manage his emotionally avoidant tendencies. 

I'm no longer attached to an outcome with E. But I will not fall back to old patterns. If he wants my time, he'll have to commit. I am still dating and living my life but I want to give him a chance. There are many unknowns. I don't know if he's dating or if he's even dated anyone at all.  I don't know if he's done any self work or if he's in therapy.  And I don't know his actual intentions. He says he wants a friendship but some of the behavior suggests otherwise

The plan

Continue living my life making time for him occasionally. Not reaching out to him first nor chasing him.  I will continue this for about 4 months. If after 4 months nothing has changed (no chat from him in wanting to be together), I'll let this fizzle out into an acquaintanceship of sorts. 
I do love him and in a perfect world I would love to be with him. But I want a secure healthy relationship and while it sucks it can't be him, I don't want to go back or lower my needs just to have him. But I'm open to being with him while he heals and obviously I will have to have strong boundaries and clear expectations for my own sake.  

The Question

Is my strategy a good one? Will not being as available and living my life help him realize I'm safe and maybe he can be with me while he heals? Or is this in vain since his avoidance will always be the problem?  Does he seem to have interest in a non platonic way?  Is he only using me as a placeholder for something better? Some of my friends tell me to tell him there's room for something since I said I want to be friends and maybe that's a boundary he's respecting. but I feel that he probably assumes I still have feelings so telling him there could be more, may activate his fear of commitment and run away. Does he intend to keep this up indefinitely? I'm not playing games but I have to be strategic to protect myself a little bit. Last year was very painful for me and while I'm open to giving him a shot, I will not let him have access to me on a casual basis.  Should I continue seeing him 2x a month or decrease the frequency?

Ultimate goal

Make his fear of losing me be greater than his fear of intimacy/commitment so he chooses me. But with the timeline of 4 months. This way I can fully move on knowing I tried my best to have something amazing with him.

I know we're not mid readers and only he knows how he feels but receiving feedback will be helpful. 

Thoughts/ suggestions/advice etc are welcome. Anyone with avoidant attachment style experience would also be helpful.

Some days starting with a Celcius in the morning and then again in the afternoon, maybe some coffee later too.  Estimating a normal day to be between 300-500mg give or take 50mg.

I have for years now struggled with brain fog, excessive tiredness, difficulty focusing, and so on.  I clock in about 7ish hours of sleep a night give or take an hour depending on the day.  My head hits the pillow and I'm out, hard, no tossing.  No difficulty sleeping almost ever.

I realized recently that the amount of caffeine I was consuming wasn't sustainable and if I over did then then I'd rely on everyone's favorite legal depressant, Alcohol, to come back down.  Bad cycle.

So Friday I decided I'd just have a homemade espresso first thing in the morning.  By late afternoon the headache was there, painkillers only dulled it.  The headache persisted all night, didn't sleep well.  Took my shot of espresso in the morning and all was right in the world again.

Saturday afternoon and evening was the same.  Repeat the same Sunday.

Saturday night I noticed I actually remembered dreaming.

This morning still had a headache but I woke up extra early to do a run/walk of just over a mile before getting ready.  This actually helped the headache.  It was still there and distracting as heck and since work needs to be done I took my espresso shot.

Planing to do the same until Saturday again and then try to cut it out 100% since I have the next week off for the holidays.

The headaches are so bad though.  I feel like a total ass to my children at times because I'll snap at them occasionally because I'm feeling on edge.

  
Long term though I don't known.  I love coffee.  Really love it.  In the past i've been buying green beans from specific farms/regions. Roasting them myself, aging them a few days to offgas, then fresh grinding and brewing.  There is nothing like it.  Don't want to give that up completely.

i’m not denying that folks like amber and lewis are entertaining dancers, because they are!! lewis did a bloody brilliant couples choice and i’m obsessed with amber’s salsa. they make the show interesting because they’re a guaranteed good performance. 

however, they make the *competition* dull because they’re a *guaranteed* good performance. if strictly was an interesting competition, there’d be a bit more peril in who we see in the final! obviously there’s always the odd shock elimination (jimmy i still miss you dearly) and sometimes leaderboard placement can be up-and-down (just think of vicky between last week and this week!), but because the final’s almost been decided by week 4, it feels like all these other eliminations are an inevitability. it’s a fight over one spot in the final against the ringers, as opposed to everyone fighting for three. 

the inclusion of the “ringer” stage school types, in my opinion, gets in the way of the competition aspect of strictly being in any way interesting. whilst it arguably improves the quality of the dances on the night to have people you know will deliver, it makes the anticipation of the final a little less fun? 

is there a solution to this? less ringers? a new voting system? 

i’m aware i’ve just had too many cups of coffee and started overthinking a fun entertainment show that isn’t that deep in the first place, but i think it’s something to be considered if strictly wants to make more entertaining television! ",3,1763406270.0,strictlycomedancing,5,0.64,False

~ 

i hate when i feel like this, especially when i have so much to be grateful for. I have a beautiful life, i have good friends, supportive parents, a sweet cat, access to care when i need it, a stable job i like, a nice safe apartment. I’ve been able to create opportunities to express myself and make art. Ive worked hard to be where I am, i decided from a young age I wouldn’t let my anxiety and fear force wasted time upon me and stop me from reaching my goals. I was able to go to europe and travel on my own, i was able to move across the country, i have been able to overcome such painful change, grief, and conflict. 

But when i feel like this, waking up with such a surge of anxiety and panic, i feel like i hate myself. When i feel out of control like this, i feel like i hate how i look, i hate what i’ve dedicated my life to, i hate my passions, im an imposter. I feel like this even when I know my baseline is bubbly, confident, and proud. Usually i find so much joy in the little parts of my life, making coffee, crafts, watching a good show. I hate when this happens, it takes the best of me away, barely anything is joyful, and it’s so difficult to overcome. I feel like i want to get out of my house and i want to rot in bed all day, all at the same time. I feel afraid to go outside, but i feel even more afraid of staying in my home. I wake up like this and all of a sudden my home doesn’t feel like my home. My life doesn’t feel like my life. I look at the wall, i have art on my wall i love, and i barely recognize it. It all feels foreign, it doesn’t feel comfortable. Nowhere feels comfortable. 

I cant do anything but move through it, and cry to my hearts content. I force food down, i force myself to half ass my job, i take a couple pills and try my hardest not to rot in my bed, because when that starts I know it will be so hard to stop for days to weeks. I’d lose dozens of pounds, i’d keep feeling nauseous and throwing up, i’d be a shell of myself by the end, and i won’t (to the best of my ability) let that happen to me anymore. 

I’ve shown myself before that I can overcome it, so why not this time too? What do i do right now to make me feel more like myself? To just start feeling better and start to see the light at the end of the tunnel? 

I take a long hot shower and i cry. I cuddle my cat and i cry. I go to work and cry on my commute. I try to distract myself with little joys, try to block myself from spiraling. And today to make myself feel a little better, i came to reddit to read about other peoples thoughts and experiences, and to share my own in hopes of catharsis for myself and maybe it’ll show others that progress is possible, even if there are setbacks sometimes.

I've had the the Vertuo Plus Deluxe machine for 3-4 years now and recently the coffee is starting to taste real sour

Almost looks like it's brewing more watery? I can tell by just the smell that it didn't brew properly, almost like it's not as strong/concentrated? I don't know if that makes sense

I've descaled it with the Nespresso descaler but still no luck

Is it time to just get a new machine? Any other tips and tricks for cleaning? Possible that  I got a bad batch of pods?

So I (26F) and my roomate (24F) have been living together for a little over 3 years. I loved living with her, but everything slowly changed once her girlfriend moved in. Her girlfriend I thought was my friend. We always hung out, we would go to the craft store and crochet together and even went to events together without her partner. She never gave me any reason to think that she didn't like me. Another piece
ofi information is e all are n not perfect at
house keeping and keeping up with things.
I grew up in a hoarder house and it has
been very hard to unlearn the behaviors
taught to me growing up, and to learn and
keep the behaviors that I should've been
taught as child. I am constantly working
on it, and there are definitely many times
that I have let myself slip into those bad
habits. But also my roommate often would
not clean up her messes as well, like
leaving coffee cups to get moldy and also
letting her things out in common spaces
and what not. So basically we are both to
blame for the state of the apartment, and
honestly don't think either of us was good
with communicating with the other the
last few months. She was asking me to
clean but also ignoring my messages. And
I was asking for her help to do bigger
cleaning tasks and trying to talk *O her the
whole time and still be friends. Now I also
understand that a few months ago my
boyfriend and her gir lfriend both started
living at the apartment, and that we don't
have as much space for all of us in the
apartment. The issue is she is now
completely blowing up on me not listening
to how have been feeling. She says that
she doesn't feel rke l've been
understanding her feelings. Another issue 
is we always had opposite schedules for
the last year. Which made cleaning so
much harder when I have told her so many
times we are able to keep the apartment
clean when we are cleaning together. I
have ADHD so having that body double
really helps and she knew that from when
we used to have more similar schedules.I
have been asking for her to clean with me
since she had her schedule changed, and
her girlfriend never offered to clean with
me.

I guess I want to know if I'm the Ahole for
how I feel and being upset that she is
moving out all the sudden and treating me
this way when I feel like I was kept in the
dark to her and her girlfriends true
thoughts and feelings.

I also would love if anyone has advice on
how we could possibly be friends again.
She was one of my best friends, but now
everything feels so messed up and 1 don't
even exactly know how it got here. She's
SO upset withme right now and I'm pretty
upset with her. But I think she's more angry at me than I am at her.

It seems like there are too many people trying to sound attractive/mention what they’re looking for in a relationship/other obvious things that clearly show they are looking for something that’s not platonic. 

And then there are so many people with profiles without any post- or comment-history  but a lot of karma (maybe I’m showing my lack of tech-savvy here, but it feels fishy).

I feel like not that long ago you could find cool people on here who genuinely wanted *just* platonic connections. But now I feel like every post has an ulterior motive that’s not quite kosher. I mean, isn’t this sub just to find platonic friends?  Has something happened that I’m not aware of, or am I reading these posts wrong??

Edit- I should add, if anyone is actually looking for a friend, I do actually want to meet people in my tribe! I’m an artist. I’m verry smert and funny, I’m empathetic to a fault.

I went back and watched all the Droyco scenes and he's either not real or it's a really good red herring and they don't want us to think he's real.

Mike finds Droyco's address, so we know there's a real person with that name listed for that address.  BUT they go to his house and knock on the door. Inner door opens, Ron and Droyco talk, inner door closes. If you watch Mike the whole time he looks bored like he's waiting for the door to open. When the door closes, he shrugs and they leave, but his shrug is very consistent with a ""well I guess no one was home"" shrug.

A minute later Mike is saying he can watch the house for a few days and Ron is like but he's clearly leaving right now. Then when Droyco shows up to Ron's work nobody else sees him.

The scene with the touch screen game in the bar is the same. Mike does not directly interact with Droyco.  Arguably he looks in Droyco's general direction one time. Ron explains the touch screen game to Mike. Mike looks bored the whole time and then plays the game while Ron and Droyco talk about returning poops to the sender.

I think it's also intentionally related to the scene where Mike approached Ron and Seth at the coffee shop and Seth clearly sees Mike and so it's like see these are real people there's no people being hallucinated by Ron. Then we meet Droyco shortly after.

Anyway, it's very possible that Droyco doesn't exist. I hope it's a red herring and he does. If he's a hallucination, it's kind of been done before. If it's a red herring and I just wasted my own time rewatching the scenes, it's brilliant.",5,1763405683.0,thechaircompany,0,0.86,False

When I first “quit” a few years ago, I went around 6 weeks before relapsing. Went another time where I went between 1-2 months but was using another drug at that time which also wasn’t healthy for me. 

Since then and for the past year, the longest I’ve been able to go is 11 days, and I did that once. It’s just so tough and feels literally impossible. I just end up feeling so depressed when I try to quit that I always end up doing it again. 

Part of the issue too could be what I use it for, being before runs and at work, which makes both much more enjoyable and easier. Especially running, it’s like I don’t even really enjoy it that much without caffeine, or at least not nearly the same amount. Having a couple cups of coffee and then going for a long run outside in the sun makes me feel incredible, regardless how anxious or low mood I felt beforehand, or how shitty my week was. Quitting coffee feels like it takes that away from me, which just feels impossible. 

Of course the sword is double edged though. My anxiety and OCD is absolutely worse while on it, sometimes so bad that it feels impossible to manage and I essentially just have to wait for it to not feel completely all encompassing. 

So, for people who quit after multiple relapses and long periods of not being able to quit, what did you do differently that actually helped you finally be able to kick it from your life? ",2,1763405609.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

She was became home to me. I remember the silhouette of her in Tulsa, the way she looked behind her coffee cup in the mornings, kissing her, us laughing and making fun of movies together, walking around Georgetown, exploring museums, laying next to her, falling asleep on the couch. Our morning talks were everything. When not together we would talk on the phone for at least an hour each day. She’s the most interesting person I’ve ever met.
She loved me completely. I’m bi, and she accepted every part of me. When I was confused, she sensed it and was patient. We made a great team. I told her “I love you” and I meant it - I don’t say those words lightly. In my heart, I wanted a future with us.

But I messed up badly. I couldn’t see what was right in front of me. When she asked for more commitment and brought up marriage, I was rude and dismissive instead of recognizing she was offering me everything I wanted. I was never satisfied even though I had what I needed.

She asked me not to contact her. I spent 2 months angry at her after the breakup. When I finally reached out 3 months later, she had moved on - she’s with someone else now.
Since then, I’ve started therapy (TMS treatment). She would have cracked up me telling her all about. I went camping with my kids and her presence was missed. I saw Predator and wished she was there next to me. Us together again. I’m planning a trip to Washington and keep thinking about how showing her WA as  potential future.

She asked me to not reach out anymore. And I wouldn’t. But I can’t help thinking of Icarus and this deep sadness within me. Am I the asshole for still grieving and wanting her kisses when she moved on.
ITA - for letting her go

1ozoqg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Mixture-1710/comments/1ozoqg6/i_hate_spawnism/,I hate spawnism >:(,"​To Whom It May Concern, and to All Who Value Merit,
​We write to voice our strong objection to the insidious practice of spawnism—the granting of privilege, position, or opportunity based solely on family lineage or birthright, rather than on demonstrated ability, effort, or experience. This corrosive tendency fundamentally undermines the principles of a fair and dynamic society.
​The Flaw in the System
​Spawnism operates under the false pretense that talent and competence are inherited rather than earned. It favors the accident of birth over the power of achievement, ensuring that paths to success are often paved for the well-connected before they've taken their first steps.
​It creates a closed loop of power, where key leadership roles—whether in business, politics, or academia—are recycled among the same families, regardless of whether a more qualified candidate exists outside that circle.
​It perpetuates inequality, solidifying existing class divides and making upward mobility an insurmountable challenge for those who lack the ""right"" surname or connections.
​Why We Must Reject It
​Rejecting spawnism is not an attack on families or inheritance; it is a defense of meritocracy and equal opportunity.
​Stifled Innovation: When positions are filled by familial appointment rather than competitive selection, competence is often sacrificed for convenience. This leads to stagnation, poor decision-making, and a loss of innovative potential for organizations and society as a whole.
​Moral Injustice: It is morally indefensible to tell one person that their hard work is not enough, while another is handed the keys to the kingdom purely due to parentage. It breeds resentment and cynicism toward institutions perceived as rigged.
​Wasted Talent: Countless brilliant, driven individuals from modest backgrounds are denied opportunities simply because their names don't open the necessary doors. Their potential contributions—to science, art, governance, and commerce—are lost to the entire community.
​A Call to Action
​We urge all institutions—corporations, universities, governments, and non-profits—to rigorously audit their hiring, promotion, and admissions practices.
​Let us commit to a system where the measure of a person is their character and their capability, not their ancestry. Let us ensure that every door is opened by a key earned through effort, not by a birth certificate. The future of a vibrant, equitable society depends on our collective rejection of this backward practice.
​Sincerely,

I do the same puck prep (\~17g, RDT, into blind shaker, light WDT, tamp, metal screen) but recently it's starting to shoot coffee from the bottom.  

My first thought was it's the new coffee I opened needs to degas some more, but a week in and still have the same issue.  Then I thought it might be the red rubber gasket needs replacing but after doing some research on online, it appears water would come out from the top if it did.

I then tried some of my old beans which I had a little left and I got the same thing..  Could it be my grinder? I'm already at the lower end of what I have been using for my espresso for the last 2-3yrs.   I've found anywhere between 6-12 is where I live and i'm at 6.

Ever feel like everyone else got the game manual for life and you're just button-mashing your way through? Same.

But over time, I've found a few ""cheat codes"" that actually work. They're not about grinding 80 hours a week; they're about optimizing the system. Here are a few of my favorites:

**\*\*The Two-Minute Rule: Infinite Action Points\*\***

This one is a game-changer for killing procrastination. The rule is simple: if a task takes less than two minutes to complete, do it *immediately*.

*   Answer that email? Done.
*   Put the dish in the dishwasher? Done.
*   Toss the laundry in the machine? Done.

It’s crazy how many of these tiny tasks we put off. Clearing them instantly frees up so much mental RAM and builds momentum for the bigger quests.

**\*\*The Energy Audit: Find Your Mana Potions\*\***

We all track our time, but what about our energy? Spend a week paying attention to what gives you energy vs. what drains it.

*   **Drained** after scrolling social media for 30 minutes? That's an energy vampire.
*   **Energized** after a 10-minute walk outside? That's your personal mana potion.

Once you know what's what, you can optimize your day to protect your energy. Double down on the potions, and build shields against the vampires.

**\*\*The Emotional Save Point: Respawn Stronger\*\***

Let's be real, some of the toughest boss battles in this game are emotional. A bad day, a setback, or just feeling lost can make you feel like you've lost all your progress. The key is having a ""save point"" to return to.

For me, that means having a plan for when things get rough. It’s not about avoiding the hits, but about recovering faster. Knowing your triggers and having a strategy to recenter yourself is a huge advantage. If you feel like you’re constantly starting from scratch after an emotional hit, it might be worth checking out **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)** to help build a solid emotional foundation. It’s like having a pre-built strategy guide for your own mind.

**\*\*The Gratitude Buff: A Passive +1 to Luck\*\***

This sounds cheesy, but it works. Before you fall asleep, just think of three specific things that went well that day.

*   The coffee was perfect.
*   A stranger held the door for you.
*   You finally finished that annoying task.

It literally rewires your brain to look for the good. It’s like equipping a piece of gear that gives you a passive ""luck"" or ""happiness"" buff that’s always active in the background.

These aren't massive, life-altering changes you have to make overnight. They're small system exploits that give you a real edge.

1ozoj2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiking/comments/1ozoj2w/favorite_las_vegas_area_day_hikes/,Favorite Las Vegas Area Day Hikes,"Greetings, friends!

  
I'll be in Las Vegas this week (Tuesday - Friday), and want to dedicate one full day and perhaps even a partial day to hiking and enjoying the desert.  I was supposed to be heading to Death Valley, but decided due to the huge rains out that way to instead base myself out of Vegas.  

I've done a few hikes in Red Rock (La Madre Springs, Ice Box Canyon).  I've also briefly driven through Valley of Fire.  

I'd be interested to return to VoF, but the hiking options all seem on shorter side.  I'm looking for something between moderate and strenuous, and I'm happy to spend most/all of the daylight hours out on the trail.  I don't mind driving a bit to the trailhead, but should probably not go too far given how limited daylight is this time of year.  

I'm giving strong consideration to Grand Circle Loop at Red Rocks.  Some seem to rate the trail as ""boring"", but I like the idea of a longer more meandering hike.  Looking at the map it seems like some other shorter hikes can be combined to form a loop. 

My biggest question, I suppose, is if there are any other hikes or areas beyond Red Rock and VoF that I should consider checking out if looking for a full day of hiking.  

Also wondering if there's a good place to pick up some fuel for the jetboil, figure I'll bring it to enjoy some coffee and perhaps a hot lunch while out and about. 

  
Plan to bring my day hiking gear and a rental car, and focus on exploring some hikes and off strip haunts that always seem to escape me.  Thinking I'll stay at TI for the free parking, though room rates seem pretty low so more options than I'd typically have.

1ozogpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1ozogpc/favorite_day_hikes/,Favorite Day Hike(s),"Greetings, friends!

  
I'll be in town this week (Tuesday - Friday), and want to dedicate one full day and perhaps even a partial day to hiking and enjoying the desert.  I was supposed to be heading to Death Valley, but decided due to the huge rains out that way to instead base myself out of Vegas.  

I've done a few hikes in Red Rock (La Madre Springs, Ice Box Canyon).  I've also briefly driven through Valley of Fire.  

I'd be interested to return to VoF, but the hiking options all seem on shorter side.  I'm looking for something between moderate and strenuous, and I'm happy to spend most/all of the daylight hours out on the trail.  I don't mind driving a bit to the trailhead, but should probably not go too far given how limited daylight is this time of year.  

I'm giving strong consideration to Grand Circle Loop at Red Rocks.  Some seem to rate the trail as ""boring"", but I like the idea of a longer more meandering hike.  Looking at the map it seems like some other shorter hikes can be combined to form a loop. 

My biggest question, I suppose, is if there are any other hikes or areas beyond Red Rock and VoF that I should consider checking out if looking for a full day of hiking.  

Also wondering if there's a good place to pick up some fuel for the jetboil, figure I'll bring it to enjoy some coffee and perhaps a hot lunch while out and about. 

  
Plan to bring my day hiking gear and a rental car, and focus on exploring some hikes and off strip haunts that always seem to escape me.  Thinking I'll stay at TI for the free parking, though room rates seem pretty low so more options than I'd typically have. 

Many thanks!",1,1763404880.0,vegas,0,0.67,False
1ozogj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ozogj2/radial_head_fracture/,Radial head fracture.,"43M from Argentina.

I would like to reduce the possibility of losing mobility. (I play the piano)

I fell off my bike and the main impact was on my elbow. I went to the ER, they took an X-ray, and nothing showed up. A few days later I started doing basic movements like lifting a little cup of coffee or holding something, and rotating my hand palm-up and palm-down. But it still hurt — even though it was slowly improving — so they ordered an MRI, and this is what it showed:

**MRI OF RIGHT ELBOW WITHOUT CONTRAST — REPORT:**  
Signs suggestive of a radial head fracture with extensive bone marrow edema are visualized. A CT scan is recommended for better assessment of the bone structure.  
Normal signal from the bone marrow of the rest of the examined segments.  
Increased intra-articular synovial fluid.  
Tendons appear preserved.  
Periarticular muscle bulk preserved.

So the doctor put my arm in a 90° plaster splint plus a sling (this ended up happening on day 11 after the fall). He told me to keep it like that for 15 days and come back with a new X-ray. I went back today and he removed the cast, but told me to continue using the sling and to only do this movement 3 times a day (10–20 repetitions each time): take off the sling, let the arm hang, and bring my hand from the side toward my chest (basically flexing the elbow). Then go back to wearing the sling all the time. I have to do this for 2 weeks, and after that I should see a physical therapist.

In the morning we potty, chill for a bit while I drink my coffee then go on a 45~min 1.5-2mile walk. Then breakfast. Then mid day potty and yard play if it’s not too gross out (Washington!) and then more chill while I work and then an afternoon longer walk about 2 miles again. Lots of random toy play in between. Also let her sniff a lot when we’re out. What am I missing?

Right now we aren’t ready on recall, leash manners are not great but not terrible or unmanageable as we train. She gets so excited when she sees other dogs and wants to jump at them so I’m nervous how she’d do at a dog park for now. Her foster mom had a younger husky puppy and they were besties so I fear she’s missing connection and that’s what she’s wanting when we see other dogs. I wouldn’t say she is acting like her needs aren’t meant, we sleep through the night her behavior is overall great (aside from the typical puppy sass when I tell her she can’t do something).

The thing I ignored: Taking nutrition seriously beyond just ""am I skinny enough?"" In my 20s, my approach to health was basically ""if I fit into my jeans, I'm good."" Ate whatever, skipped meals when busy, lived on coffee and the occasional salad to balance out the pizza and wine. My idea of ""healthy eating"" was ordering a Diet Coke with my burger lmao.

Fast forward to 32, and my body basically staged a revolt. Constant fatigue, hair thinning, nails that would break if I looked at them wrong, brain fog that made me feel like I was operating at 50% capacity. I chalked it up to ""just getting older"" (lol at thinking 32 is old) or work stress.

Finally dragged myself to the doctor who ran bloodwork and surprise surprise - multiple vitamin deficiencies. Iron, D, B12, the whole party. She basically looked at me and said ""when was the last time you actually paid attention to what nutrients you're putting in your body?"" Crickets. Because the answer was literally never.

Here's what I wish someone had told 25-year-old me: Your body doesn't give a shit if you're ""eating clean"" for Instagram aesthetics. It needs actual nutrients to function. Like, boring shit like vitamins and minerals that nobody talks about because it's not sexy or trendy.

I started being way more intentional about nutrition - actually tracking what I eat (not just calories, but actual nutrients), taking vitamins daily to cover gaps, eating for energy instead of just eating to not gain weight. The difference is honestly night and day.

Other things I ignored that I'm now paying for:

* Sunscreen. Yeah yeah, everyone says this, but I really thought I was invincible. Now I'm dealing with sun damage and wishing I could slap some sense into past me.
* Sleep. Treated sleep like it was optional in my 20s. ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" and all that toxic hustle culture BS. Turns out chronic sleep deprivation catches up with you and your body doesn't forget.
* Preventive healthcare. I only went to the doctor when something was actually wrong. Never got regular checkups, never did bloodwork, just assumed if nothing hurt, I was fine. Spoiler: that's not how bodies work.
* Stress management. Just constantly running on adrenaline and cortisol, thinking that's normal. Now I'm trying to undo years of that damage and it's way harder than if I'd just dealt with it earlier.

What I've learned: Your body keeps the receipts. Everything you ignore or put off in your 20s doesn't just disappear - it compounds. And fixing shit in your 30s is way harder than just maintaining it would've been.

The annoying part? None of this is revolutionary advice. It's all basic shit that older people tried to tell me and I ignored because I thought I knew better. Turns out they were right and I was just young and dumb lol.

So what about you? What health thing did you blow off in your 20s that you're now dealing with or wish you'd prioritized sooner? I need to know I'm not the only one who was this oblivious.",79,1763404400.0,AskWomenOver30,53,0.97,False

If you’ve ever watched a big-name chain stack up visibility on Google while your own listing barely gets noticed, you’re not alone. Most small business owners feel the same frustration. But here’s the part many don’t realize: Google’s local algorithm isn’t built to favor the biggest brand — it’s built to reward the most *relevant* and *engaging* local business.

That’s the opening small businesses need.  
Not more money.  
Not more staff.  
Just better optimization.

# The Local Ranking Signals Google Actually Cares About

Google evaluates hundreds of micro-signals, but three of them guide the entire map pack ecosystem — **Relevance, Proximity, and Prominence**. Beneath those pillars are dozens of subtle cues:

* Choosing the exact right category
* How thoroughly your profile fields are completed
* Whether people click, scroll, and interact with your listing
* What your photos communicate about your business
* How often new reviews appear and what they say

Small businesses tend to outperform here because they’re closer to the customer and quicker to update their profiles. Google rewards that kind of agility.

# Why Smaller Companies Can Outrank Industry Giants

Chain locations run on templates. Their descriptions, photos, and categories rarely match the nuances of a local audience.

A small business, on the other hand, can lean into real neighborhood identity — the kind of details that show up in reviews, photos, and engagement patterns. Those signals tell Google: *This business matters to local searchers.*

# Micro-Moments That Drive Conversions

People usually aren’t searching for generic businesses anymore. They’re searching for solutions in tiny, intention-loaded bursts:

* “Best coffee near me that’s open now”
* “Affordable plumber same day”
* “Dog groomer for anxious dogs cityname”

When your profile reflects these moments through your description, services, review content, and posts, Google treats your business as the answer. And real customers respond.



# The Core Optimization Framework

This framework is the backbone of a small business that consistently shows up in the top local pack.

# Get Your Primary Category Exactly Right

Your **primary category** is one of the heaviest ranking signals in Google Business Profile — and it’s often chosen incorrectly. With over 4,000 possible categories, small shifts matter:

* “Coffee shop” isn’t the same as “Café.”
* “Marketing agency” is different from “Internet marketing service.”
* “Cleaning service” can mean several very different things.

One misalignment and Google will confidently rank someone else instead of you.

# Use Secondary Categories to Strengthen Relevance

You don’t need to stack dozens of categories. Just two or three strategic secondary categories can dramatically expand your relevance without muddying your identity.

Think of this as building a small, tight web of meaning around what you offer.

# Write a Description That Signals Expertise

Your business description should feel natural — but it should also subtly weave in:

* What you specialize in
* Who you serve
* What makes your service unique in the local area

Google’s NLP models pick up on local cues like neighborhoods, city names, and service-specific terminology. Customers respond to the authenticity.

# Maintain Perfect NAP Consistency

Your Name, Address, and Phone Number (NAP) must match everywhere — down to punctuation and abbreviations. Inconsistencies create doubt, and doubt reduces visibility.

When your digital footprint matches, Google treats you like a real authority in your category.



# Visual Trust Builders

People trust what they can see. Google does the same — and it measures how people interact with your photos.

# Upload the Photos Google Loves

High-performing business profiles nearly always include:

* Outside and storefront photos
* Interior photos
* Team and staff shots
* Product or service photos
* Before-and-after examples
* Seasonal updates

Google tracks how often photos are added, how varied they are, and whether users interact with them. Fresh visuals equal fresh ranking opportunities.

# The Truth About Geo-Tagging

Geo-tagging once mattered. Today it doesn’t — Google strips EXIF data from images. What *does* matter is the frequency, clarity, and relevance of the images you upload. Clean, bright, intentional photos perform best.

# Choose a Cover Photo That Converts

Think of your cover image like your storefront at first glance. The best cover photos are:

* Well-lit
* Clear and professional
* Easy to understand at a glance
* Centered around people or purpose

Photos that look “real but elevated” usually outperform stock-like imagery.



# Engagement Signals & Behavioral Ranking Boosters

The more people interact with your business listing, the more Google sees it as useful — and the more it rewards you with visibility.

# Generate Reviews With Strong, Natural Sentiment

Google doesn’t just count reviews. It reads them, analyzes their patterns, and weighs them. It looks for:

* Fresh reviews arriving consistently
* Sentiment improving or staying positive
* Reviews with detailed descriptions
* Organic keywords customers naturally use

You can guide this by prompting customers:  
“Let others know what service you had done and how it helped you.”

It feels natural and leads to richer content.

# Use the Q&A Section to Your Advantage

Most small businesses ignore the Q&A feature completely — and that’s a missed opportunity. You’re allowed to ask and answer your own most important questions, creating structured, keyword-rich content that Google often pulls into AI answers.

# Post With Purpose Instead of Habit

Posting weekly sends a strong freshness signal. But generic posts don’t move the needle. Your posts should:

* Answer local questions
* Address real customer concerns
* Highlight time-sensitive offers
* Include visuals and micro-CTAs

Every post helps Google understand your services more clearly.



# Tracking, Insights & Continuous Refinement

The businesses that grow year after year aren’t the ones who optimize once — they’re the ones who keep listening, adjusting, and improving.

# Watch for Behavioral Patterns Inside GBP Insights

Patterns matter more than individual spikes. Pay attention to:

* The search terms that bring people to you
* When phone calls or direction requests increase
* Photo view trends
* Whether “discovery searches” are growing over time

These signals show which parts of your profile are working — and which ones are holding you back.

# Expand Into Local Intent Keywords

Google automatically associates your business with related search phrases. Monitoring these emerging terms helps you identify new opportunities:

* Services to highlight
* Posts to create
* Words to sprinkle into your description

This is how you grow your relevance footprint organically.

# Study Your Competitors Through Overlap Signals

When Google shows your business in “people also search for,” it’s telling you who you share topical territory with. These overlap patterns are incredibly valuable. If your profile is stronger in:

* Reviews
* Photos
* Posting frequency
* Category precision

Google begins to push you ahead of those competitors.

* **Whitespark Local Citation Finder** — Helpful for tightening your NAP consistency.

https://preview.redd.it/7o83ucbj1v1g1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abbf141f784dae167ca5a3f7549d6f6af85dee11

When it comes to upgrading your car interiors, the Hyundai New Santro offers a perfect opportunity for personalization. One of the simplest and most impactful upgrades you can make is installing high-quality seat covers. They enhance the overall cabin look, make daily drives more comfortable, and protect the original seats from dust, sweat, food spills, and long-term wear. At **Autoform India**, a leading manufacturer of car seat covers, bike seat covers, and automotive accessories, customers can explore a wide range of designs tailored for durability, style, and comfort.

Whether your preference is a premium luxury finish or a budget-friendly option that offers everyday practicality, there are many trending choices available for the New Santro in 2025. Each option adds a unique charm to the vehicle while improving user experience.

The New Santro is widely known as a dependable family hatchback, but its stock fabric seats often lack the durability and premium feel that today’s customers look for. Over time, factory-fitted seats tend to lose their shine and become prone to stains or fading. Installing high-quality seat covers helps preserve the original upholstery and upgrades the interior aesthetics at the same time.

Seat covers offer better protection from dust, sun exposure, and accidental spills. They also improve comfort, especially when designed with layered foam or ergonomic stitching. For users who want to maintain a clean, stylish, and long-lasting cabin, customized seat covers from Autoform India provide a reliable solution.

Luxury seat covers are designed for those who want a premium and modern car interior similar to higher-segment vehicles. 

**1. 3D Custom-Fit Leatherette Seat Covers -** One of the most popular choices is the 3D custom-fit leatherette seat cover. These covers are crafted to fit the Santro’s seat contours perfectly, giving a sleek, snug, and premium look. Their smooth, durable material elevates the cabin’s overall appearance and offers long-term usability. Stitching patterns like diamond, vertical, and box stitching add character and make the interior feel more upscale. Color combinations such as black with red piping, tan with black inserts, and cream with quilted texture are especially trending.

**2. Nappa Leather-Touch Seat Covers -** Another luxury option that has gained strong popularity is Nappa leather-touch seat covers. Known for their soft texture, they give the cabin a premium leather-like feel without the high maintenance of genuine leather. These covers create a smooth and elegant appearance, enhancing both comfort and aesthetics. They are well-suited for car owners who prefer a refined driving environment with a plush seating experience.

**3. Dual-Tone Premium Seat Covers -** Dual-tone seat covers are also becoming a top trend among Santro owners, especially younger buyers. These color combinations add contrast and give the cabin a fresh, modern vibe. Black and beige, tan and coffee, and grey and black are among the most preferred combinations. Each design helps break the monotony of single-tone interiors and adds visual depth to the compact cabin.

**4. Ventilated Leatherette Seat Covers -** Ventilated seat covers, created using perforated leatherette material, are also trending due to India’s climatic conditions. These covers help improve airflow, reduce heat accumulation, and offer more comfort during long summer drives. They maintain a cooler seating surface and ensure a hygienic, breathable feel.



# Budget-Friendly Seat Cover Options for Hyundai New Santro

Many Santro buyers look for attractive interior upgrades without exceeding their budget. **Fabric seat covers** are one of the most affordable solutions. They are lightweight, breathable, and available in various textures and patterns. Their washable nature makes them convenient for daily-use vehicles, families, and office commuters.

Another budget-friendly option is **PU leatherette seat covers**. These covers replicate the appearance of leather while being economically priced. They are durable, easy to clean, and resistant to stains and water, making them ideal for frequent use. Matte finishes, embossed textures, and contrast stitching styles remain popular in this category.

The **Eco Series seat covers** provide an additional budget-conscious solution. These covers balance affordability with long-lasting quality and do not compromise on comfort or appearance. They maintain a clean and tidy cabin look without requiring heavy investment.

**Mix-material seat covers**, which combine fabric and leatherette, are also trending because they offer an attractive appearance at a reasonable cost. They deliver the softness of fabric and the premium feel of leatherette, making them a smart option for buyers seeking both

Hey guys, let me start by mentioning that I do not live in the UK but travel here fairly often (4 times in the last 2 years) and will be here again for a short stay on the 24-30th November. 

A bit about me: I'm 32yr, geeky and in the tech field. I love watching movies, tv-shows and my favorite genres are sci-fi, horror and adventure. 
Lord of the rings is my absolute favorite movie ever. I also enjoy table tennis, football, trying different teas and dark chocolate. 

Despite being an introvert, I've traveled my fair share of different countries. Mostly tagging along family or friends. 

I'm looking for friends to chat online, get recommendations for places to visit or restaurent to try. maybe meet up in person when I'm here for general activities like getting coffee, cinema, and trying new restaurants.  I'm kind of shy with strangers, especially girls, so I apologize in advance if i come off as awkward at first. 

My favorite topics are finance, movies, tv shows, crypto, tech stuff.",1,1763404095.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,0.67,False

I wiped it up right away and let the laptop dry until the next day. After that I pulled off the spacebar to clean underneath and accidentally broke the small plastic clip that’s attached to the spacebar keycap (not the metal frame or the laptop body itself).

Now, a couple of days later, some keys on the left side have become really sticky. My Esc, left Shift, and F1–F4 keys all press down and then slowly rise back up, like pressing into a pillow. They still register presses and the laptop works fine otherwise, but the feel is awful and it’s clearly a hardware issue from the coffee.

I live in St. John’s, NL and I’ve already talked to a few local IT / computer repair shops. So far they either don’t have a solution or say they’d basically need to replace the whole keyboard/palmrest, which sounds expensive.

I just talked with ASUS support and they need me to send the laptop over to their centre for repairs and an estimate on the price. I suppose it'll be expensive because I also talked with best buy geek squad about it, and they told me it would take a couple hundred bucks to fix it.

  
What’s my best move here?

* Is there a realistic way to fix the sticky keys and replace just the spacebar key/clip myself?
* Should I order a replacement keycap kit or full keyboard assembly online, and if so, from where for this exact model?
* Any tips from people who’ve done coffee-spill cleanups or key replacements on this series of ASUS ROG laptops?

What else would you all suggest? I am in such a hassle right now because I am a uni student and I got my finals coming up in December. Thank you!

Recently the same settings is now only yielding me 12-13g of beans in the portafiltet. If I try to grind anymore the portafilter overfills. I cleaned out the grinder and the same thing is happening. I do have a new bag of coffee but it’s the same espresso beans and brand. Is this a machine problem related to the grinder or is it a bean problem? My next step was to weight 18g of beans and then grind them out to see but I don’t know how that would be any different.

It is a two-floor house. The second floor is separate from the first, it’s basically like two apartments except the top floor has a lot of work still. 

The agreement was until we can financially save up a little bit more money to finish the second floor, my husband, our baby and I would be living on the first floor as my in-laws have an apartment of their own so they don’t live here, they’re not even in the same neighborhood. 

When this house was being built, my in-laws contributed financially more than my husband but my husband did contribute more with working on site and actually building the house alongside financially. So I think he has a say in all of this.

First, they come without a heads up. They don’t care if we’re sick, if we have guests, if we’re just tired and need to rest. They will come regardless. When we’re not home, same thing - they come here, rearrange things, for example plant flowers in the garden, do something messy and leave the mess for me to clean, which by the way I don’t need extra mess because I have back problems as is. Then they invite people over here and then they go to their own apartment. 

If my husband didn’t contribute absolutely anything I wouldn‘t take this to heart but I DO, I am trying so hard to keep this house intact so when they come to live on the first floor where we are now I want them to have everything in good condition still. But I feel so disrespected. I understand that they will come and live here but WE are currently living here and there are OUR things and it’s OUR privacy. I feel like our privacy is constantly being violated.

Once we tried setting a boundary - we were all sick with high fever and they just sent us a text that said they would come, without even asking. My husband told me to tell her (in his name because he had a headache due to a tooth surgery), that were really sick and that we would come to theirs another time when we’re feeling better. She threw a fit about it - called my husband on his way from work to tell him how neglected she felt, how I am a bad influence on him, how she feels I’m pushing her away from him ALL BECAUSE WE WERE FKN SICK.

Also, this is the woman who my husband asked not to come for at least a week after our baby was born since I wanted to rest and she told my aunt ‘’ I gave her (ME) 2 days but I can’t hold out anymore, I’m going to their house’’, proceeded to put dirty money into a newborns hands, kiss her even though we told her not to and when we did she was waiting for us to be gone so she can do it secretly, expected lunch and coffee from ME, and hasn’t cooked a meal for a new mother with a small baby with anything other than what we already had at home (which btw we had nothing at home atp).

I’m hoping someone here might have some advice or experience to share. At the moment I keep bouncing between DVV and Immigration, searching for a way into Finland! 

I’m a 58-year-old Brit in a relationship with a Finnish man (he’s 60). Since Brexit, it’s hit me how tricky it is for me to actually live in Finland long-term.

A bit of background: my mum was born in Finland but moved to the UK in the 1960s, where I was born in 1967. Altho she did become a British citizen in the 1970s, she returned to Finland to live and regained her Finnish citizenship in early 2000s. Today, sadly she has dementia, so she can’t really help fill in the blanks.

I’ve been learning Finnish for about six months now (slow going but I’m determined — I can order coffee and compliment people’s dogs, so that’s something!). I’m still working, but I’ll retire in 2027 and have a comfortable pension — so I won’t need to work or rely on any benefits. Just want to be with my partner and enjoy life there.

So… I’m trying to figure out my options:
	•	Do I have any chance of residency based on my Finnish family background?
	•	Is marriage really the only realistic path for a non-EU person like me?
	•	And if we do get married in Finland, what’s the process like — any paperwork nightmares I should know about?

I’ve seen similar posts here, but everyone’s situation seems a bit unique, so I thought I’d throw mine into the mix.

Thanks so much for reading — and extra kiitos if you can share any info or personal experience. (Also: I’m already falling in love with Karelian pies and saunas, so it feels meant to be 😄)",1,1763403838.0,Finland,24,0.53,False

Collapse shows up to the Resistance base and summons enemies plus King Dark inside. Meanwhile, Kurato and Hara are struggling to decrypt Dr. Mizuno’s data and video message. Emi shows up with coffee for them, unable to calm down without doing something despite her injured leg. She asks for a progress report; the data’s still taking some time, but the video should be finished today or tomorrow.

https://preview.redd.it/u0i3ic5m0v1g1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0496a0b90f1b6e0ceed7e79bdf37b248e0f7dc7b

Just then, the emergency alert goes out as Collapse’s attack starts. Kurato and Hara begin backing up the data while Emi is told to get to safety. However, Hara says he can manage, and wants Kurato to help Emi. He especially doesn’t want to risk losing Kurato as he’s the Resistance leader. Kurato relents, but he asks Hara to abandon the data and run if he needs to.Koichi’s group return to base and see the wreckage, wondering if there are any survivors. Koichi is distraught that he got carried away by Ruin’s game, and Takeuchi tells him to stay calm. What they need to do is defeat the Abnormals and save as many survivors as possible; just because the base is destroyed doesn’t mean everyone is dead. They split up into Abnormal hunting and rescue groups, with Koichi joining the hunting group.

Hara is almost done backing up Mizuno’s data when he spots hidden files and checks them out. He’s shocked at what he’s found, but Jiru suddenly shows up. Meanwhile, Koichi is fighting monsters with his summons and making way for wounded Resistance members to escape, then him and EMI move on to the next area calling for help.

# Chapter 5-3

Koichi’s group finishes taking out the Abnormals around them while worrying a lot about the others. A member tells him the safe zone defense group is coming to help, meaning Lina's coming. Emi, Kurato, and Lina show up right then. Emi and Kurato were hiding in a shelter when Takeuchi helped them, while Lina’s group came to support them after getting the distress call. Takeuchi himself shows up not long after. Kurato tells Koichi it’s not his fault the base attack happened, but Kurato’s for not anticipating a diversionary attack. They talk about Hara staying behind to back up the data and think he’s sheltering there. Koichi and Takeuchi decide to go back to rescue him while everyone else stays here.

# Chapter 5-4

The duo enters the lab in the Resistance base. They find the computers destroyed and signs Hara was fighting Abnormals. They then find Hara’s dead body and a flash drive next to him. It must have Dr. Mizuno’s data on it, but they’ll check it later. Koichi holds onto it. Takeuchi then gets injured protecting Koichi from a hiding Abnormal and starts to bleed a lot. They feel an earthquake and make ready to escape. Koichi doesn’t want to leave Hara’s body here, but Takeuchi says they can take care of him once the situation settles down.

Koichi helps Takeuchi get outside. The earthquakes grow as King Dark emerges from the ground.Koichi sets Takeuchi in a safe place while he prepares to fight, and Collapse appears. We get a redux of the prologue scene with Collapse saying “Long time no see, kid!” and adding that he’s not fond of cowardly tricks like the attack he just did. Koichi is angry on behalf of the countless people Collapse killed and hurt, and Collapse callously replies he never intended to trample them with King Dark, so he didn’t count.

Koichi’s rage at Collapse prompts him to remember Kamen Rider X, and the boss fight starts.

https://preview.redd.it/yrwjg8ys0v1g1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5940f5724e18751903729651120dfb3f6e93c3bf

(Also, it was here that I realized I’ve been playing the game wrong the entire time. For boss fights you need to have a few Striker and Breaker type characters (ones with sword icons) to actually damage the boss, instead of rely entirely on Shooters building up finisher gauge. Through all my attempts I’ve been using Sentinels exclusively.)

We defeat King Dark, and Koichi turns his rage on Collapse. He’s surprised we actually beat King Dark and sees Koichi is not just some kid. He retreats, but he promises that next time, we’re all going to get it.

Emi and friends join up with us and rush to treat Takeuchi’s wounds. Takeuchi assures Koichi him getting hurt is not his fault, and that protecting comrades is natural. He then loses consciousness. Koichi explains what happened to Hara and that he found a flash drive. Kurato says they'll check it out later.

Lina asks Kurato for an order, and he says they’ll abandon this base, mourn the dead, and have all survivors regroup at the main Resistance HQ. Koichi calms down, and is reassured again that this situation was Kurato’s fault for being lax in his judgement. They thank Koichi that many other lives have been saved because of him.

Emi mentions that by going to HQ, they mean going to the dam in area F, and Kurato says it's the closest base to this spot. Koichi thinks about how he’s lost a lot, but he still has many comrades alive, and heads out with everyone to the next area.

It was July 2023. I met the girl of my dreams. Or so I thought.

She was smart, (really) funny, we had a lot in common, and hung out every single day. And we did FUN things together. Went on FUN dates. Most importantly, she was super cute. I thought she was the one.

Fast forward to February 2024. We got married. We move in together.

And that's when things got... tough.

Suddenly, life got real boring. We both had 9-5 jobs. We came home, put on the same Netflix show (Vampire Diaries) every single night. We stopped talking. We became roommates instead of lovers. There was one night I remember specifically, we only spoke 10 words to each other. The WHOLE NIGHT. And we weren't even mad at each other, we just didn't want to be friends anymore.

Slowly but surely, this turned to resentment. The bickering, the arguments, the blaming, you know the drill. Until one day, I realized this would eventually ruin our relationship for good. We didn't even have kids yet, and I was worried for our future.

**So, like any good engineer, I built an app to solve my relationship problems. 😂**

The idea was simple. Create a *SHARED* bucket list for the two of us. We could add things to do to the list, and then in our free time, we could check off the items and add photos to the memories. 

We could add big and small things to the list. Try this new coffee shop, go on a walk on the boardwalk, go fishing, hot air balloon ride, ANYTHING we wanted to do together.

Simple idea, and yet this fundamentally changed our relationship.

It's been a couple months now, and our relationship has seen higher highs than when we first met. We giggle like we are dating in high school. We flirt like we used to. Our relationship isn't perfect yet, but I think we have successfully broken the ""routine"" of daily life, even with our 9-5 jobs. 

I know this may not be a permanent solution to our problems. But it's a start. **And I'm more and more convinced that routine is the enemy of a healthy relationship.**

**TLDR:**  
  
My wife had a “sexual emotional affair” with a coworker in August. No confirmed physical sex, but explicit online sexual content plus several in-person interactions. She also had simultaneous financial infidelity. I exposed everything immediately and she went no-contact the same day. Over the last 90 days we’ve been in IC, MC, group therapy, FANOS check-ins, boundary work, and full transparency. There were two early trickle-truths but nothing since, and she no longer works anywhere near the AP. Reconciliation is brutally hard and weekends still crush me, but we’re communicating better than we ever have, and I’m choosing to give this a real effort with clear dealbreakers. Still undecided long-term, but we are making observable progress.

**Quick facts for context**

* Married 19 years, together 21 (both in our 40s)
* Length of the affair: several months earlier this year
* We’ve always both worked, both from home for long stretches
* She was working back in an office for the first time in many years
* Two teenage children – who both know more about what happened than we’d prefer (thanks to overheard yelling), but in some ways it’s been good they know.
* Affair: coworker, emotional with heavy online sexual content; multiple physical but non-sexual in-person interactions
* Still living together (I slept in a separate bedroom for \~2 weeks post–D-Day; that was the right move at the time, and moving back into our room was the right move for reconnecting)

  
**Re-cap if you don't want to go spelunking in my past posts:**

I’ve heard it said that the only thing more painful than infidelity is the loss of a child.  I wholeheartedly believe that to be true.

About three months ago, I walked in on my wife using WhatsApp in the bath late at night. I pushed for a conversation the next morning and learned she had been having what I would call a *sexual emotional affair* with a younger, married coworker from her work gym. They didn’t have confirmed physical sex, but they exchanged explicit messages, photos, and videos, including one very graphic video she had also sent to me. There were also walks together around campus, coffee outings in each other’s cars, two lunches, two after-work events, hallway conversations and other interactions that clearly crossed emotional and boundary lines.

This was all on top of discovering she had quietly run up significant debt just weeks after I had helped pay off a previous round of significant hidden debt that had developed over a few years.

In the first hours and days, I exposed everything: I reported him to their work ethics line, told his wife, and emailed several of his coworkers. She judged me harshly for “putting his job and family at risk.” That response hurt deeply. Now, 90 days out, I don’t regret a single part of that exposure. It broke the affair fantasy and forced the situation into the light. But ultimately, no-contact only worked because she chose to stop, not because of my actions.

Before any of this, our marriage had grown disconnected. We never attempted therapy, never followed through on improving communication, barely did date nights, and drifted for years. She had gotten into great shape and was receiving outside validation. I was depressed, burned out at work, and withdrawing. We weren’t talking about anything meaningful regularly.  This doesn’t justify her actions – 100% - but it did create the atmosphere for it – ultimately though it was on her to cross that line, and she owns that and I place no blame on myself for the affair.

This is my 90-day reflection.

 

**Where we are today**

She now works from home full-time in a great new job-one that I helped her get, but only because she genuinely wanted it and it was a better opportunity. If she were still at the old office building, one floor away from the AP, I doubt reconciliation would be on the table.

She went no-contact the day she disclosed, and I’m as confident as I can be that it has stayed that way. Her early messages to her closest friend, hidden messages she didn’t know I knew about, and her behavior since D-Day have all been consistent and support that.

Only two “trickle truths” surfaced, both early:

1. An after-work event pre-dinner where others bailed, leaving her and the AP having dinner alone before the event
2. Sitting together alone in her car for 10–15 minutes after the event

I’ve already done the mental calculus on those moments. They were the closest thing to opportunity aligning with privacy, and I understand the implications of that. But nothing new has surfaced in many weeks.

**Financial infidelity reality check**  
I’ve always handled our finances. I regularly offered to show her everything-income, monthly spending, college savings, debt, etc-but she never showed interest and I didn’t push it, which I absolutely regret now. Sitting her down after D-Day and showing her the full picture was eye-opening for her. She genuinely didn’t understand how her “retail therapy” spending impacted college savings, vacations, cars, home projects, retirement, and long-term stability. Seeing the numbers finally made it real for her. Whether the change sticks long-term remains to be seen, but it was a major turning point.

**Disclosure letter**  
Two weeks after D-Day (before our intensive weekend retreat), I had her write a full disclosure letter - timeline, interactions, mindset, everything. Last night, I had her read it out loud to me for the first time, then reflect on what she sees differently now. Hearing her early-stage denial, shame, and fantasy-thinking spoken in her own voice - and then hearing her current perspective - was incredibly grounding. I wish I had asked her to read it aloud earlier.

 

**Therapy**

We’re both in IC, MC, and group therapy. We did the an intensive weekend retreat early on. We read and discuss books together, listen to podcasts, and for the last few weeks have been doing nightly FANOS check-ins. These have built more emotional connection than we had in years before the affair and have been difference makers I believe.

She’s also finally digging into her deeper emotional patterns. She grew up in a home where emotions were not “allowed” - no crying, no vulnerability, no expressing needs. That created lifelong habits of avoidance and suppression that directly fed into the secrecy and emotional escape of the affair. This doesn’t excuse what she did, but it somewhat explains how she got there.  I’m the opposite, showing emotion has never been hard for me.

I (and I think also her now) recognize the affair wasn’t actually about the AP. It was about the attention, the dopamine high, the fantasy, the version of herself she saw reflected back. You could swap him out with countless other guys who said the right things at the wrong time. I went to his house and talked to him and his wife in their driveway, which weirdly gave me closure even though I still wanted to knock him into a different zip code.  His wife was very warm towards me, although me showing up at their house unexpectedly obviously was scary for both of them (and absolutely pissed my wife off…  good. :) ).

 

**A few of the boundaries we’ve built around men**

These are guardrails she has embraced (so far).

**1. No private or secret communication channels with men.**  
No WhatsApp, disappearing messages, secret chats, or emotional venting to male coworkers. If she wouldn’t say it in front of me, she doesn’t say it.

**2. No one-on-one social time with male coworkers outside true job necessity.**  
No coffee runs, casual lunches, car rides, gym interactions, or “just hanging out.” Work is strictly professional. No blurred lines.

**3. Proactive transparency around any male interaction that could blur boundaries.**  
If a male coworker messages her, if she ends up unexpectedly alone with a man, or if anything feels remotely gray, she brings it to me on her own. Not for approval, but for honesty and safety.

**WhatsApp, mind movies, and what I never saw**

I never saw the WhatsApp messages. They were gone between the Friday night discovery and the Saturday discussion. Sometimes I wish I had grabbed her phone that first night. But after hearing what many betrayed husbands discovered, months of graphic sexts, I’m weirdly grateful I don’t have that burned into my brain. Fighting my own imagination and what I did see is hard enough.

My two most intrusive mind movies are:

* Walking in on her in the bath that first night, the expression on her face when she realized the secret was out and her initial denial
* The graphic video she sent me, and then later sent to him

Those two images alone can wreck an entire day if I let them.

 

**My mindset today**

If I’m completely honest: I want to give reconciliation a real chance. Not because I’m scared of being alone, and not because reconciliation is the easier path (it’s not, divorce is emotionally easier in ways I believe). I want to try because I believe there is still real love here today and real potential if we both do the work.

I’ve made it very clear: any return to secrecy - romantic or financial - ends the marriage. Not a threat. Simply the consequence. She understands that without pushback.

Weekends are still rough for me. Friday through Sunday lines up perfectly with the original D-Day arc: discovery, disclosure, fallout. In the early days that meant pure anger. Now it’s mostly grief, sadness, numbness. I still have my “I’m done” moments during these crashes. She’s learned not to panic at them because we both understand the difference between emotional flooding and a true decision. If I ever reach the latter, I will file, a sheriff will show up to serve her and she will then know.

During the week, though, we often feel genuinely connected. Just this weekend at our son’s football tournament, we spent the entire day together: coffee runs between games, sitting close – much of it with her on my lap, talking and laughing. Those moments are the reason I haven’t walked away. Without that connection, I would have been gone already.

Only in the last few weeks has she truly “woken up.” Early on, everything seemed foggy and halfhearted. Shame and denial were still running the show. Now her words, body language, and consistency finally match. She’s emotionally present in a way she wasn’t before.

Sexual intimacy has been very healthy.  The lack of physical sexual elements in the affair were absolutely a major factor in that.  It’s easy to put this all in the “hysterical bonding” category, perhaps that’s true, but I’ll take it for now as it feels genuine.  I wouldn’t say our sex life was awful or remotely non-existent previously (probably averaged once a week), but it does feel more connected now, and yes – more frequent – at least for now.

I’ve been on leave from work through most of this. A blessing and a curse. Too much time to overthink, but I wouldn’t have been functional in a high-pressure new role anyway.

I’ve also taken the time to clean up and share with her areas of my own life - not infidelity, nothing even remotely comparable, but things I wasn’t proud of. She has never weaponized any of it. Not once.

**Trust and safety today**

I have full access to her devices and accounts. I recently told her she could change her passcodes if she wanted to - she chose not to. I do check her iphone time usage breakdown on her phone to look for signs of any concerns (this will show hidden apps too).

Because of my technical background, I know she doesn’t have burner phones, secret accounts, or hidden credit lines. I also have alerts on all three credit bureaus for extra safety.

But long-term, I don’t want to be a detective. I wasn’t that person before any of this, and I don’t want to live like that. “Trust but verify” is where we are now - not where I plan to stay forever.

The biggest shift is in our communication. If we had talked like this years ago, the affair wouldn’t have lasted a week, or I’d like to believe might not have happened at all (again, not my fault, I know that).

**Advice for anyone in the early days**

* **Start FANOS or some other daily “check-in” now** – it won’t be easy in the early days, but do it.  Agree to set aside the hurt, the anger, the walls and just do it.
* **Your situation is unique.** Reddit loves sweeping judgments, and people by default are pessimistic online. Don’t let them decide your life.
* **Reconciliation is harder than divorce.** It requires deeper effort, vulnerability, and consistency than most people realize.
* **Find community.** Group therapy, private support chats, trusted friends. But be mindful of where others are in their own journeys.  My group chats with other betrayed guys from the weekend retreat and other group therapy have been a lifeline.  Friends and family mean well but don’t “get it” if they haven’t lived it.
* **Journal.** Get the chaos out of your head and on paper.  I took too long to buy into this idea, but I’m glad I finally did.
* **Write hurt letters.** Raw ones. Don’t send them immediately - wait and decide later. Most you won’t send.
* **Don’t make decisions in a spiral.** Give yourself 48–72 hours. A 20-year marriage deserves that pause.  I still suck at this
* **Read Shirley Glass’ “Not Just Friends.”** It reframes the entire landscape of how affairs form and a framework for rebuilding – wish I’d read it cover to cover in week 1.
* **Listen to “Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life” with caution.** It’s validating but will send your brain into scorched-earth mode instantly.  Was good when I wanted to come back from a walk at 150% pissed off mode – it worked every time.
* **Move your body.** Walk, lift, run, golf-physical movement is medicine.
* **Get sunlight.** It matters.
* **Sleep and eat.** Basics fall apart fast. Keep them intact.
* **Work on and prioritize yourself.** Whether you leave or stay, you need to become someone you respect and recognize again.  “Fixing” the marriage before yourself is a failed plan.
* **Focus on the longer term goal** Longer term can mean 3 months, not 3 years.  If you focus on the day-to-day fluctuations, it really will feel like a roller coaster.

 

**Where I stand at 90 days**

I don’t have a final answer, of course.

Literally within the last 24 hours, I’ve said the words to her, “I don’t know if I can be with someone who is capable of this.  I don’t want to be.” She openly said how that hurt her and made her feel disconnected and by the time we went to sleep, we were talking calmly and reconnecting again.  I don’t know if that’s clinically health or not, but we were communicating and we’re still together this morning.  That’s worth something.

Some days divorce feels inevitable.  The paperwork is drafted, I just need to tell the attorney “go” and pay the filing fee.  
Some days reconciliation feels fully possible.

What keeps us going is that we both want this. Not out of fear, not out of obligation, but because there’s something real here worth fighting for.  And those frequent moments of connection are very tangible and meaningful.

We’re nowhere near healed. But we’re not drowning anymore. And for now, that’s enough to keep trying.  And both of our kids can sense the shift.

Final note: Don't bother with the ""you should leave her, immediately."" or ""she 100% had sex with him"" posts. I've had 90 days of those self-inflicted mental loops, hearing it from the peanut gallery has zero effect now. But by all means, it's reddit, knock yourself out :)

Starbucks might be a good example. It's not hard to find new people who can serve coffee. So if employees are striking, why don't they just get fired and SB finds new employees? Or, if the employees are truly undervalued, why not just start a new coffee shop and run it as they please? Those employees want the risk to be taken by someone else but want more reward, right?

Further, why am I supposed to not get coffee from SB if there's a strike? The employees have better benefits than I do. The alternative is I go to a coffee shop where the employees get no benefits.

The Holidays are approaching, which means guests and a lot of them! Whether it’s your family staying for a week or your friends dropping in for a long weekend. Your guest room needs to be more than presentable; it has to be holiday-ready. And to achieve this, you do not have to do a complete renovation or spend a massive budget to transform the guest space. With these five strategic quick fixes, you can improve your living room from “just okay” to “please invite me back” in no time. 

**1st Quick Fix - What is the quickest way to upgrade your guest’s comfort?**

Always start with the bed -it is non-negotiable. Your guest will forget about the expensive decor you added, but they will never forget a stormy night’s sleep. Always invest in high-quality bedding with a high thread count and layer it properly with a mattress protector, a fitted sheet, a flat sheet, a blanket, and a comforter. If your guest bedroom mattress is too old, consider a [custom foam mattress](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/custom-cut-mattress-inserts) topper to add support without the expense of a complete mattress replacement.  For the pillows, add at least four- 2 soft and 2 firm to accommodate different sleeping preferences. These simple modifications will immediately convey that you have considered their comfort. 

**2nd Quick Fix -How can I make my guest bedroom more inviting in under an hour?**

Please focus on the sensory details to make the room calming for them. Clear all the clutter and personal items. Add a warm-tone bedside lamp, place fresh flowers or a small plant on the dresser, light a scented candle, or use a subtle room spray. Make sure your cupboards have empty spaces and hangers for them to keep their belongings. A full-length mirror is an easy way to make your space feel more welcoming. These thoughtful touches are exactly what any **bedroom designer** will tell to create an inviting environment. 

**3rd Quick Fix - What basic amenities must I keep?**

Here, you need to think like a hotel, but better. Create a guest basket with travel-sized toiletries, a new toothbrush, pain relievers, and antacids. You can place this in the room or the bathroom, depending on where you have the suitable space. Add a luggage rack or a designated corner where suitcases can rest, nobody wants to live out of a bag on the floor. Keep water and glasses in the room, and if you have space, add a [custom foam](https://www.fabricakraft.com/collections/custom-foam) mattress **c**ushion on a reading chair to create a cozy corner for you. 

**4th Quick Fix -How do I handle privacy concerns and temperature control?**

Temperature is a deeply personal choice, and getting it wrong can ruin the guest’s complete stay. Provide them with multiple blanket options- a lightweight throw and a heavier comforter. If the room lacks individual temperature control, you can place a small fan and room heater in the closet. For privacy, add blackout curtains if the windows face the road or get early sun- consider **acoustic fabric** options that will block both light and sound. The most important thing is to check whether the door lock is working correctly. 

**5th Quick fix- What to add as final touches?**

Add details like reading books, handwritten welcome notes, and instant coffee or tea for early risers. Make sure all drawers and surfaces are dust-free and clean, and that everything smells fresh. 

Holiday hosting should not be stressful. By using these five fixes, you can easily transform your standard guest room into something your guests always want to return to.

1oznus0,https://www.reddit.com/r/luftablassen/comments/1oznus0/warum_erleben_wir_gerade_eine_welle_an/,"Warum erleben wir gerade eine Welle an „Authentizitäts-CEOs“, deren wirtschaftliche Substanz kaum mit ihrer Selbstdarstellung mithält?","In den letzten Jahren hat sich auf LinkedIn und Instagram eine erstaunlich homogene Spezies von „Gründer\*innen“ herausgebildet, deren ökonomische Realität in einem merkwürdigen Spannungsverhältnis zu ihrer digitalen Selbstinszenierung steht. Man beobachtet Personen, die sich mit geradezu missionarischem Eifer als CEOs, Personal-Branding-Gurus und Finance-Educators präsentieren, obwohl ihre unternehmerischen Strukturen oft eher an experimentelle Nebenprojekte erinnern als an tatsächlich skalierende Geschäftsmodelle. Es ist eine neue Form der hypermodernen Ich-Ökonomie: ein Kapitalismus der Erzählung, in dem die Biografie profitabler wirkt als das Produkt und Authentizität performt wird wie ein ästhetisches Accessoire.

Besonders auffällig ist der rhetorische Dauergebrauch pseudo-heroischer Erfolgsnarrative: „Vor 18 Monaten bei Null gestartet, heute mittlere sechsstellige Umsätze“, begleitet von einer überraschenden Vorliebe für die Rechtsform der haftungsbeschränkten Miniaturgesellschaft. Die Gründung einer UG mit 1.000 Euro Stammkapital wird hier nicht etwa als Zeichen struktureller Schwäche gelesen, sondern als mystische Geburtsstunde eines Imperiums, das sich offenbar ausschließlich über Storytelling, Selfies mit Matcha und fehlerfreie Typografie dank Chat GPT in Pastelltönen finanziert. Die Tatsache, dass Menschen mit angeblich beeindruckenden Jahresumsätzen nicht die ökonomisch naheliegende Rechtsform einer GmbH wählen, bleibt in diesen Narrativen seltsam unerwähnt – vermutlich, weil sie nicht in den dramaturgischen Spannungsbogen einer Workation in Kapstadt passt.

Hinzu kommt eine bemerkenswerte Diskrepanz zwischen behaupteter Expertise und tatsächlicher Fachlichkeit. Die Popularität von „Finance-Education“ Start-Ups, gegründet von Personen, deren akademische Laufbahn eher auf mediale Selbstdarstellung als auf wirtschaftswissenschaftliche oder finanzmarktbezogene Vertiefung hindeutet, lässt sich medientheoretisch als Symptom einer Kultur interpretieren, in der Kompetenz zunehmend durch Kohärenz im Feed ersetzt wird. Man muss nicht viel über Finanzmärkte wissen, solange man ausreichend sicher zwischen Gründerfloskeln oszilliert und das Narrativ der „empowernden Wissensvermittlung über Finanzen für FRAUEN“ aufrecht hält. Dass manche dieser Projekte kurzfristig an der ökonomischen Realität scheitern, während gleichzeitig ästhetisch anmutende Matcha-Routinen und Pilates-Sessions inszeniert werden, ist eine Ironie, die fast schon so perfekt ist, dass man sie verdächtigt, absichtlich konstruiert worden zu sein.

Aus ökonomischer Perspektive entsteht der Eindruck, dass hier weniger Unternehmen aufgebaut werden als Identitäten. Es handelt sich um ein Milieu, in dem die Selbstvermarktung nicht Begleiterscheinung, sondern Geschäftsmodell ist; in dem Narrative als Cashflow fungieren und der Algorithmus zum eigentlichen Investor wird. Der materielle Konsum – Workations, Third-Wave-Coffee, Mood-Lighting-Co-Working-Spaces – scheint nicht aus unternehmerischer Stabilität hervorgehen, sondern eher aus einem performativen Verpflichtungsgefühl gegenüber der eigenen Marke: Man muss wohlhabend wirken, um Glaubwürdigkeit im Bereich „Selbstoptimierung“ zu demonstrieren, selbst wenn diese Glaubwürdigkeit auf flüchtigen Ad Impressions und dramaturgisch überzeichneten LinkedIn-Monologen basiert.

Es entsteht dadurch eine merkwürdige Form kognitiver Dissonanz: Menschen, die ihre Finanzkompetenz predigen, scheitern mitunter an der elementaren Frage nach betriebswirtschaftlicher Nachhaltigkeit; Personen, die Authentizität beschwören, kuratieren ihr Leben in einer Weise, die fast schon museal wirkt; und Individuen, die sich als Entrepreneure bezeichnen, führen Unternehmen, die juristisch, finanziell und strukturell kaum über ein ambitioniertes Studierendenprojekt hinauszugehen scheinen.

Ich frage mich daher zunehmend, ob wir es hier tatsächlich mit einer neuen Generation erfolgreicher Unternehmer\*innen zu tun haben – oder mit einer algorithmusgetriebenen Avantgarde des performativen Kapitalismus, deren wirtschaftlicher Erfolg weniger in Zahlen als in Erzählungen messbar ist. Vielleicht sind diese Menschen nicht naiv, sondern die logische Konsequenz eines Systems, in dem Sichtbarkeit als ökonomische Ressource wichtiger geworden ist als Substanz. Vielleicht sind wir es, die naiv sind, wenn wir noch zwischen Realität und Inszenierung unterscheiden wollen.

  
Trotzdem frage ich mich: Sind die alle überschüldet oder wie finanzieren sie ihre auf Selbstdarstellung ausgelegten performativen Lifestyle? Günstig ist das ja alles nicht. Hat hier jemand Insights?",7,1763403583.0,luftablassen,8,0.89,False

The ones that won did the OPPOSITE of user feedback. This is Part 2/5: The Product Truths. (My product team stopped speaking to me.),"
**The realization that  broke everything:**

Month 8 of research. Sitting in coffee shop at 2:34am. Can’t sleep.  Just finished reading the 441st startup case study.

Pattern emerging that made zero sense: **The companies that religiously followed user feedback… died. The ones that ignored it strategically… became unicorns.**

Wait. What?

Pulled up spreadsheet. 847 companies. New column: “How closely did they follow user requests?”

**The math that destroyed my worldview:**

- Companies that built exactly what users asked for: 89% failed
- Companies that built what users needed (not asked for): 91% became unicorns
- The correlation was  inverse to everything I’d been taught

My product management training just became expensive toilet paper.


## THE BREAKING POINT (Friday, 11:47pm)

Reading Brian Chesky interview about Airbnb. He said something that made me spit out my coffee:

*“If we’d listened to users in 2008, we’d have  built a better air mattress. They literally told us: ‘Make the mattresses more comfortable.’ We ignored them and built trust systems instead.”*

Pulled up more examples:

- **Instagram:** Users begged for more features.  Kevin Systrom deleted 13 features instead.
- **WhatsApp:** Users demanded stickers, games, monetization. Jan Koum said no for 5 years.
- **Superhuman:** Users wanted it cheaper than $30/month. Rahul Vohra raised it to $33/month.

Every one became massive. By ignoring users.

**The spreadsheet that  made me question everything:**

Built analysis framework:

1. What users SAID they wanted
1. What founders actually built
1. The gap between them
1. Outcome (success/failure)

**Result:** 0.89 correlation between “ignoring specific user requests”  and “achieving unicorn status.”

I was furious. Three years of product management training. All wrong.


## PART 2: PRODUCT & CUSTOMERS (Truths 11-20)

### Truth #11: Your Best Feature Is The One You Haven’t Built Yet. And Your Customers Don’t Know They Need It.

**The pattern that broke  conventional wisdom:** Winners stay perpetually dissatisfied.

**Apple:** Steve Jobs (2001-2015). Released iPod. Could’ve stopped. “We won digital music!”

Instead: iPhone (2007). Could’ve stopped. “We won phones!”  
Then: iPad (2010). Could’ve stopped.  
Then: Watch (2015).  
Then: Services (2019).  
Never satisfied. Never “done.”

Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to  the thing you’ve got to focus on. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas.”

**The brutal insight:** Stopping means dying. The moment  you think your product is “done” is the moment competitors smell blood.

**Amazon:** Jeff Bezos (1994-present). Started with books. “Online bookstore” was the vision.

Kept asking every year: “What’s next?”

- 1998: Music, videos
- 2005: Prime (seemed insane - free 2-day shipping loses money)
- 2006: AWS (we’re a  bookstore launching cloud infrastructure?)
- 2014: Alexa (voice computing)
- 2020: Healthcare, satellites, grocery stores

Bezos: “If you’re not stubborn, you’ll give up on experiments  too soon. If you’re not flexible, you’ll pound your head against the wall.”

**Contrast - The ones who got comfortable:**

**Blockbuster (1985-2013):** Dominated video rental. Peak: 9,000 stores, $6B revenue (2004).

Got comfortable. “We’re  the video rental champions!”

Turned down buying Netflix for $50M (2000). Reed Hastings pitched partnership. Blockbuster laughed him out.

Why? “We have the model figured out. Late fees are 16% of our revenue. Why change?”

Dead by 2013. Netflix worth $150B today.

**BlackBerry  (1999-2016):** Dominated smartphones. Every executive, every government official had one.

Got comfortable. Physical keyboard was “what customers want.” Touchscreens were “just  a fad.”

iPhone launched (2007). BlackBerry dismissed it: “No keyboard? Business users won’t switch.”

Wrong. Dead by 2016. Apple worth $3T today.

**The brutal truth:** The moment you stop asking “what’s next?” your competitors start  asking it for you.

**What to do:**

1. Always have 3 unbuilt features your top customers are demanding
1. The day you don’t have this list is the day you’re  out of touch
1. Monthly question: “If we only existed for 6 more months, what would we build?”
1. That answer = your roadmap

### Truth #12: Users Will  Lie To You About What They Want. Watch What They Do Instead. Behavior > Words. Always.

**The pattern that validates sociopaths:** Stated preferences ≠ revealed preferences. Ever.

**Facebook (2006-2009):** Mark Zuckerberg. Every user survey, every focus group:  “WE WANT MORE PRIVACY CONTROLS!”

Usage data showed the opposite:

- Profile views: Up 340%
- Public posts: Up 290%
- Photo sharing: Up 410%
- Location tagging: Up 380%

Users SAID they wanted privacy. Users BEHAVED like they wanted to  share everything publicly.

Zuckerberg (2010 interview): “I could’ve built what they said they wanted. But  I built for what they actually did. That’s why News Feed worked.”

**News Feed launch (2006):** Immediate backlash. “This is invasion of privacy!” “We want to  control what’s shared!”

Petitions to remove it: 700,000+ signatures.

Usage data: **News Feed usage up 200% in first month.** Time on site up 300%. They hated it with their words. Loved it with their behavior.

**iPhone vs. BlackBerry (2007):**

**The research said:** “Business users NEED physical keyboards for email. Touchscreens are inefficient.”

Every focus group: “I’d never  give up my keyboard.”  
Every survey: “Touchscreen for typing? No way.”  
Every competitor: “See? Users demand keyboards!”

**Steve Jobs:** “People don’t know what they want until you show  it to them.”

**iPhone launched (2007):** Those same BlackBerry users saying “never touchscreen?” They bought iPhones. Millions of them. Revealed preference destroyed stated preference.

**The brutal truth:** People don’t lie on purpose. They just don’t know what they  want until they experience it.

**Superhuman (2017-present):** Rahul Vohra. Building premium email client.

**Users in surveys:** “We’d pay $10/month MAX for email. Gmail is free!”

**Rahul’s decision:**  Price it at $30/month.

**Users’ actual behavior:** 200,000 person waitlist. 75% say they’d be “very disappointed”  without it. Pay $360/year happily.

They SAID they’d pay $10. They PAID $30. Behavior won.

**What I learned doing customer research:**

**Month 1:** Did 47 customer surveys asking “what features  do you want?”

**Month 2:** Built those features. Launch. Crickets. 8% adoption rate.

**Month 3:** Installed behavior analytics. Watched what users actually DID, not what they SAID.

**Shocking data:**

- Feature they requested most (18 times): Used by 3% of  users
- Feature nobody mentioned: Used by 84% of users daily
- Feature they said they “definitely need”: 0.2% usage

**The moment I knew surveys were lies:**

Thursday, 3:17pm. Customer email: “Why did you  remove [feature]? We need it!”

Checked usage logs: That customer never used that feature. Not once. In 8 months.

They didn’t lie on purpose. They genuinely THOUGHT they used  it. Memory lies. Behavior doesn’t.

**The brutal truth:** Your analytics know your customers better than your customers know themselves.

**What to do:**

1. Stop doing feature surveys. Waste of  time.
1. Install behavior analytics immediately (Mixpanel, Amplitude, whatever)
1. Track: Time in feature, return visits, depth of usage
1. Build for top 10% of actual usage, not 90% of  requests
1. If survey says X but behavior shows Y, build Y every time


### Truth #13: Your Most Annoying Customer Is Your Future Avatar Customer. Stop Avoiding Them.

**The  pattern:** Power users are annoying because they care deeply. They’re also your only signal worth following.

**Superhuman (2017-2019):** Rahul Vohra. First 1,000 beta users.

**The “annoying” customers:**

- Sent 10-15  emails per week with feature requests
- Demanded keyboard shortcuts for EVERYTHING
- Complained about 50ms delays in loading
- Wrote essays about why certain workflows were broken
- Scheduled calls to walk through their ideal UX

**Rahul’s team:** “These people are insane.  Ignore them. They’re not normal users.”

**Rahul’s decision:** “These ARE our users. Everyone else isn’t our customer.”

Built every feature they demanded:

- Keyboard shortcuts for everything (124 shortcuts)
- Speed optimizations (100ms load time)
- Workflow improvements  (they wanted triage, he built triage)

**Result:** Those “annoying” customers became champions. Average referral: 14 people each. They sold Superhuman better than any ad campaign.

$30/month premium email. $100M+ ARR. Built entirely for the “annoying” power users.

**Figma (2016-present):**  Dylan Field. Competing against Sketch.

**The “annoying” designers in beta:**

- Demanded multiplayer mode (seemed insane - design is solo work)
- Wanted browser-based (seemed slow - Sketch was native)
- Demanded version history (seemed  complex - Sketch had save files)
- Complained relentlessly about every pixel

**Dylan’s team:** “These designers are too demanding. We should target casual users.”

**Dylan:** “No. These designers are the future. Build everything they ask for.”

Built it all:

- Real-time multiplayer (seemed impossible)
- Browser-based (seemed inferior)
- Infinite version history (seemed expensive)
- Sub-pixel rendering (seemed unnecessary)

**Result:** Those “annoying” designers left Sketch in WAVES. Brought their entire companies with them. Figma beat Sketch despite Sketch’s 8-year  head start.

Adobe acquired Figma for $20B. Because Dylan built for the annoying power users who actually cared.

**The moment I  learned this personally:**

Month 4. Customer named Sarah. Emailed 3 times per week. Every week. For 2 months.

“Why doesn’t this work?”  
“This feature needs improvement.”  
“I have 8 ideas for better UX.”

My team: “She’s exhausting. Let’s just  refund her and move on.”

Me at 11pm: Curious. Checked Sarah’s usage data.

**Sarah’s stats:**

- 47 hours per week in product (most users: 3 hours/week)
- Used every feature we had
- Referred 6 paying  customers
- Renewal rate: 18 months straight, never missed payment

She wasn’t annoying. She was committed. She emailed because she cared.

**Friday, 9:15am:** Scheduled call with Sarah.  90 minutes. She walked through every pain point.

**Implemented 11 of her 14 suggestions over next 6 weeks.**

**Result:**

- Sarah referred 31 more customers (her entire company)
- Those customers: 89% retention rate (vs. 67% average)
- Sarah became our  case study customer

The “annoying” customer became our best customer.

**The brutal truth:** If your “annoying” customers left, you’d lose your roadmap AND your champions.

**What to do:**

1. Find customers who email  weekly with ideas. These are your partners.
1. Don’t dismiss them as “too demanding.” They’re too committed.
1. Schedule monthly calls with top 10 most “annoying”  customers
1. Build for them specifically. They’re your avatar customer you haven’t recognized yet.


### Truth #14: Freemium Works For Tools. Doesn’t Work For Solutions. Know The Difference Or Die.

**The  pattern:** Tools can be free. Solutions solving painful problems must be paid.

**Slack (2013-present):** Stewart Butterfield. Launched with extremely generous free tier.

**Free forever:**

- 10,000 message history
- Unlimited  integrations
- Unlimited apps
- 1:1 video calls

**Why freemium worked for Slack:**

- It’s a TOOL (chat platform)
- Value is network effect (“your whole team is already here”)
- Upgrade trigger is organic (hit message  limit or need advanced features)
- Free tier proves value, paid tier is inevitable at scale

Result: 65% of paid customers started on free tier. Freemium was the entire growth engine.

**Superhuman (2017-present):** Rahul  Vohra. $30/month from day 1. Zero free tier. Never will be.

**Rahul’s explanation:** “Superhuman isn’t an ‘email tool.’ It’s solving ‘email overwhelm’ which is worth $360/year. If we made  it free, we’d attract people who don’t value their time.”

**Why paid-only worked:**

- It’s a SOLUTION (solving painful problem: inbox hell)
- Value is immediate (save 3+ hours per week)
- Free tier would  attract wrong customers (people not in enough email pain)
- $30/month filters for people with email pain worth $30/month to solve

Result: 200,000 person waitlist. All willing to pay $30/month. No free tier ever  needed.

**The catastrophic freemium failures:**

**Evernote (2008-2020):** Phil Libin. Built note-taking app. Generous free tier: unlimited notes, 60MB monthly uploads.

**The freemium trap:**

- 96% of  users stayed free forever
- 4% converted to paid ($7.99/month)
- Free users cost money to serve (storage, sync, support)
- Lost $169M from 2014-2018 despite 225M users

**Why freemium failed for Evernote:**

- Note-taking isn’t  painful enough to pay for
- Free alternatives (Apple Notes, Google Keep, Notion) good enough
- It was a “nice to have” tool, not a “must have” solution

Nearly bankrupt. Sold in 2022 for fraction  of peak valuation.

**Dropbox (2008-2020):** Drew Houston. Freemium model: 2GB free.

**The plateau problem:**

- Free tier was TOO good for most users
- Only power users needed more than 2GB
- Conversion rate:  4% free to paid
- Had to shift to enterprise sales to survive
- Consumer business struggled for years

**Why freemium was wrong for Dropbox:**

- Cloud storage isn’t painful enough for  individuals to pay
- Businesses needed it (compliance, collaboration) but individuals didn’t
- Should’ve been B2B-focused from day 1, not freemium consumer

**The brutal truth:** If your product solves a  painful problem, charge immediately. If it’s a “nice to have,” freemium might work (but probably won’t).

**The framework I use now:**

**Ask: “Is this a vitamin (nice to have) or painkiller (must have)?”**

**Painkiller signals:**

- Customer is actively suffering RIGHT NOW
- They’ve tried 3+ other solutions already
- They’ll pay TODAY if you can solve it
- Problem costs them real money/time to ignore
- Example: Superhuman (inbox hell), Stripe (payment  hell), Datadog (monitoring hell)
- **Strategy:** Charge immediately. No free tier.

**Vitamin signals:**

- Customer isn’t suffering, just wants improvement
- They’re using free alternatives fine
- “It would be nice if…” language
- No urgency  to solve
- Example: Notion (notes), Canva (design), Grammarly (writing)
- **Strategy:** Freemium might work, but expect low conversion

**What to do:**

1. Honest assessment: Are you solving active pain or providing  nice-to-have improvement?
1. If painkiller: Charge from day 1. $30-300/month depending on value.
1. If vitamin: Either pivot to find the pain, or accept freemium with 2-4% conversion  rates
1. Don’t convince yourself your vitamin is a painkiller. The market will tell you brutally.

### Truth #15: You Can’t Build Products By Committee. But You Can’t Ignore Users Either. The  Balance Is Vision + Validation.

**The pattern:** Visionary founders use data to validate vision, not create it.

**Apple (2007):** Steve Jobs launching iPhone. Famous quote: “People don’t know what they want  until you show it to them.”

**But here’s what he didn’t mention publicly:**

Apple ran extensive usability tests on:

- Touch sensitivity (tested 1,000+ variations)
- Icon size (tested 47 different sizes)
- Scrolling  physics (took 6 months to get “feeling” right)
- Keyboard layout (tested 23 variations)

Vision was Jobs’ (touchscreen smartphone). Validation was data-driven (which specific implementation worked).

**Vision + Validation = iPhone.**

**Amazon Web Services  (2006):** Jeff Bezos. Vision: Amazon’s infrastructure could be a service for developers.

**Nobody asked for AWS:**

- Customers didn’t say “we want to rent Amazon’s servers”
- Developers were building  their own infrastructure
- It seemed insane (why would a retailer launch cloud computing?)

**But Bezos validated before launching:**

- Talked to 200+ developers about infrastructure pain
- Learned they hated managing servers
- Learned they wanted to  pay only for usage
- Learned they needed reliability over features

**Vision was his** (AWS as a service). **Validation came from developers** (specific features and pricing model).

Launched AWS with developer feedback integrated. Now $80B+  annual revenue.

**The committee failures (all vision, no validation):**

**Google Wave (2009):** Built by brilliant engineers. 3 years in development. Zero customer validation during building.

**The  vision:** “Real-time collaborative documents that combine email, docs, and chat.”

**The problem:** Nobody actually wanted that combination. It solved a problem that didn’t exist.

Launched with massive hype. 100,000 beta users. 98%  never came back after first use.

Shut down in 2010. All vision, zero validation.

**Microsoft Zune (2006):** Built to compete with iPod. Committee-designed by executives  who never used iPods.

**The vision:** “Social music sharing! WiFi connectivity! Brown color!”

**The problem:** Committee designed it based on what executives THOUGHT was cool, not what users actually wanted.

Sales: Catastrophic.  Discontinued 2011.

All committee, zero vision, zero validation.

**The validation failures (all data, no vision):**

**MySpace (2005-2008):** Tom Anderson. Obsessed with copying Facebook feature-by-feature.

Facebook launched News Feed?  MySpace copied it.  
Facebook changed profile layout? MySpace copied it.  
Facebook added games? MySpace added games.

**Result:** Lost all differentiation. Users left for original (Facebook). MySpace was pure reactive validation  with no vision.

Dead by 2008.

**The brutal truth:** Vision without validation = arrogance. Validation without vision = mediocrity. You need both.

**What to do:**

1. Have strong thesis about  what SHOULD exist (vision)
1. Talk to 50+ potential users about their current pain (validation)
1. Build first version based on vision + validation
1. Launch to small group (10-100 users)
1. Watch behavior, adjust thesis  (updated validation)
1. Repeat forever: Vision → Validate → Adjust → Vision

### Truth #16: Pricing Is Product. Not Finance. How You Charge Changes What You Build.

**The pattern:** Your pricing model determines  your product roadmap more than your vision does.

**Netflix (1997-2007):** Reed Hastings. DVD rental by mail.

**1999 pricing:** $4 per rental (like Blockbuster).

**Problem:** Customers rented 1-2 DVDs per  month. Engagement low. Churn high. Math didn’t work.

**2000 pricing shift:** $19.99/month unlimited rentals.

**What changed:**

- Suddenly recommendation algorithm became CRITICAL (help users find movies to justify  subscription)
- Added queue system (plan what to watch next)
- Added ratings (improve recommendations)
- Added personalization (keep them subscribed)

**Pricing change = product strategy change.**

Now worth $180B. All because pricing shift forced  different product priorities.

**Salesforce (1999-present):** Marc Benioff. Chose “per seat” pricing from day 1.

**Why per-seat pricing changed the product:**

- More seats = more revenue
- Built collaboration features (approvals, workflows,  teams)
- Built admin controls (manage multiple users)
- Built permissions system (different roles, different access)

**If they’d priced per usage:** Would’ve built for individual productivity, not team collaboration.

**Pricing drove product.** Now $280B  company.

**Intercom (2011-2018):** Des Traynor. Initially priced per message sent.

**Problem with per-message pricing:**

- Customers LIMITED messages to control costs
- Less usage = less value = higher churn
- Customers angry about  “surprise” bills
- Product became associated with anxiety

**2018: Switched to per-seat pricing.**

**What changed:**

- Customers sent UNLIMITED messages (no anxiety)
- Usage went up 340%
- Built features for team  collaboration (multiple seats = more value)
- Churn dropped 28%

**Pricing model was wrong for the product.** Changing pricing changed everything.

**The brutal pricing mistakes:**

**Waze (2009-2013):** Uri Levine. Navigation  app. Priced at $0 (free).

**Why free was brilliant:**

- Network effects (more users = better traffic data)
- Can’t charge for navigation (Google Maps was free)
- Monetization was eventual  acquisition

Sold to Google for $1.1B. Free pricing was the ONLY viable strategy.

**But they almost priced it at $2.99/month:**

Early investor pressure: “You need  revenue!”

Uri’s response: “Revenue kills network effects. Network effects = entire value prop. We monetize via acquisition.”

He was right. If they’d charged, they’d have died.

**Superhuman:** Rahul Vohra.  $30/month. Rejected investor pressure to go freemium.

**Why $30/month was THE product:**

- Filters for users who value their time at $15+/hour
- Those users have important emails (better  for algorithm training)
- Those users refer other high-value users
- Premium pricing = premium experience expectations (drove product quality)

**If they’d gone freemium:** Would’ve attracted users who don’t value time. Product quality  would’ve suffered. Premium positioning lost.

**Pricing protected the product.**

**The brutal truth:** Your pricing model creates incentive structures. Those incentives determine what you build. Choose carefully.

**The framework:**

**Ask: “What behavior do  we want to encourage?”**

**If you want MORE usage:**

- Don’t price per usage (creates anxiety)
- Price per user/seat (encourages unlimited usage)
- Example: Slack, Notion, Figma

**If you want network  effects:**

- Price free initially (maximize users)
- Monetize later via ads/acquisition/premium tiers
- Example: Instagram, WhatsApp, TikTok

**If you want premium positioning:**

- Price high immediately (filters for right customers)
- Never discount (maintains  positioning)
- Example: Superhuman, Rolex, Tesla

**What to do:**

1. List what behaviors you want to encourage
1. Design pricing that encourages those exact behaviors
1. Recognize your pricing model will  determine your roadmap for next 5 years
1. Choose intentionally, not reactively


### Truth #17: Your First 10 Customers Should Be Friends. Your First 100 Should Be Strangers. Know The Difference.

**The pattern:** Friends validate  you’ll help people you know. Strangers validate you have a business.

**Facebook (2004-2006):** Mark Zuckerberg. Launched at Harvard (friends and classmates).

**Phase 1 (Friends - Month 1):**

- 1,000 Harvard  students in 24 hours
- All people he knew or was connected to
- Proved: Works for people who trust Mark

**Phase 2 (Friendly strangers - Month 2-6):**

- Expanded to other Ivy League schools
- Students he didn’t know but similar demographic
- Proved: Works beyond Harvard specifically

**Phase 3 (Strangers - Month 7+):**

- Opened to all colleges
- Then all  schools
- Then everyone
- Proved: Universal appeal, not just college thing

Each phase validated different assumption. Friends → friendly strangers → complete strangers.

**Dropbox (2007-2008):** Drew Houston. MIT student.

**Phase 1  (Friends):**

- Built it for himself first
- Shared with MIT classmates
- Got 50 people using it daily
- Proved: Solves real problem for technical users

**Phase 2 (Strangers):**

- Demo video on Hacker  News (April 2008)
- 75,000 signups in 24 hours
- None of them knew Drew
- Proved: Business potential, not just friend favor

**The transition from 50 friends to 75,000 strangers was the PROOF.**

**The mistakes (skipping  the stranger phase):**

**Color (2011):** Bill Nguyen. Raised $41M before launch. Based on friend enthusiasm.

**Launched to press with celebrity backers:**

- Friends/investors raved about it
- Downloaded by 100,000  people first day
- Strangers: “What is this? Why would I use this?”
- Shut down within a year

**Friend validation ≠ stranger validation.**

**Quibi (2020):** Jeffrey Katzenberg. Raised $1.75B from Hollywood friends.

**Every friend/investor:** “This is brilliant! Short-form premium  content on mobile!”

**Strangers:** “Why would I pay $5/month for this when I have YouTube/TikTok free?”

Shut down in 6 months. Lost nearly everything.

**Friend enthusiasm ≠ market validation.**

**The brutal  truth:** Friends will support you no matter what (they love YOU). Strangers only support you if you solve THEIR problem (they don’t care about you).

**What I learned personally:**

**Month 1-2:** Built product. Showed  10 friends. They all said “this is amazing!”

Felt great. Thought I had product-market fit.

**Month 3:** Launched to strangers on Twitter.

71 signups. 3 paying customers. 96% bounce rate.

**The truth:  **

- Friends said yes because they liked ME
- Strangers said no because product wasn’t good enough
- Friends’ validation was emotional support, not market validation

**What to do:**

1. **First 10 customers (Friends):** People  who know and trust you. Validates you’re helpful.
1. **First 100 customers (Strangers):** People who don’t know you. Validates you have a business.
1. **If friends won’t use it consistently:** Product not  ready for anyone.
1. **If strangers won’t pay for it:** Business not ready to scale.
1. **The jump from friends to strangers is where 90% fail.** That’s the real test.


### Truth #18:  Retention > Acquisition. Always. Forever. No Exceptions.

**The pattern:** Growth without retention = leaky bucket. You’re bailing water while the boat sinks.

**Zynga (2009-2013):** Mark Pincus. FarmVille launched on Facebook.

**The insane  growth:**

- 10M users in 6 weeks
- 83M users at peak (2010)
- Fastest growing game ever
- Every metric looked amazing

**The  hidden disaster:**

- 30-day retention: 2% (98% of users never came back)
- 90-day retention: <1%
- Tried to replace churned users with more acquisition
- Spent millions on Facebook ads to replace churners

**Result:** Couldn’t  sustain. Stock went from $15 → $2. Company nearly died.

**All acquisition, zero retention = death.**

**Contrast - The retention champions:**

**Snapchat (2011-present):** Evan Spiegel.

**Grew slower than competitors:**

- Instagram  launched 2010 (1 year earlier)
- Vine launched 2013 (video competitor)
- Both grew faster initially

**But Snapchat focused on retention:**

- DAU/MAU ratio: 70%+ (daily active / monthly active)
- Meant:  70% of users who tried it came back DAILY
- Built features for retention (streaks, stories, filters)
- Acquisition was secondary

**Result:** Vine died (2017). Instagram copied Snapchat features. Snapchat worth $17B+ today.

**Retention won.**

**Netflix (2007-2020):** Reed  Hastings.

**Acquisition was easy:** Big brand, easy signup, free trial.

**Retention was the strategy:**

- If trial users didn’t watch 4+ hours in first week: 90% churned
- Built  recommendation algorithm to increase viewing
- Added binge-watching features (next episode auto-play)
- Created original content to prevent churn

**Focus:** Keep subscribers, not just acquire them.

**Result:** 230M+ subscribers. $180B valuation. **Because retention was  priority #1.**

**The math that reveals the truth:**

**Scenario A: High acquisition, low retention**

- Acquire 10,000 users/month
- 30-day retention: 10%
- Month 1: 10,000 users
- Month 2: 11,000 users (10K new + 1K  retained)
- Month 6: 12,857 users
- Month 12: 14,286 users

**Scenario B: Low acquisition, high retention**

- Acquire 2,000 users/month
- 30-day retention: 70%
- Month 1: 2,000 users
- Month 2: 3,400 users  (2K new + 1.4K retained)
- Month 6: 11,529 users
- Month 12: 23,692 users

**High retention ALWAYS wins long-term.** Always.

**The brutal truth:** You cannot acquire your way  out of a retention problem. Ever. It’s mathematically impossible.

**What to do:**

1. **Track 7-day, 30-day, 90-day retention.** These are your only metrics that matter.
1. **If 30-day retention below 40%:** Stop  all acquisition. Fix retention first.
1. **Build retention features** (why users come back) before acquisition features (how users discover you).
1. **Cohort analysis:** Track every user cohort monthly. Are newer cohorts retaining better? If not, you’re getting  worse.


### Truth #19: Your NPS Score Means Nothing. Repeat Purchase Rate Means Everything.

**The pattern:** People say nice things. Wallets tell the truth.

**MoviePass (2011-2019):** Stacey Spikes. Launched unlimited  movies for $9.95/month.

**The fake signal (NPS):**

- NPS score: 72 (amazing!)
- “Would you recommend MoviePass?” → 90% said yes
- Customer reviews: Glowing
- Press coverage: “Revolutionary!”

**The real signal (repeat  behavior):**

- When price increased to $14.95: 90% cancelled
- When restrictions added: 85% cancelled
- When facing bankruptcy: 95% didn’t care

**NPS was fake. Willingness to pay was real.**

Dead by 2019. Lost  $300M+.

**Dollar Shave Club (2012-2016):** Michael Dubin. Razor subscription.

**The mediocre NPS:**

- NPS score: 28 (not impressive)
- “Would you recommend?” → 50% said “maybe”
- Razors  aren’t exciting
- Surveys showed lukewarm sentiment

**The real signal (repeat purchase):**

- Repeat order rate: 80%+
- Customers kept reordering month after month
- LTV: $120+ per customer
- Churn: <5% monthly

**Sold to  Unilever for $1B.** Repeat purchase predicted success, not NPS.

**ClassPass (2013-2018):** Payal Kadakia. Unlimited fitness classes for $99/month.

**The amazing NPS:**

- NPS score: 65+
- Users raved about  it
- “Best service ever!”
- Social media love

**The terrible repeat behavior:**

- Users cherry-picked premium classes only
- Gyms lost money on every visit
- ClassPass lost money on every subscription
- Had to  cap usage (users revolted)
- Had to raise prices (users left)

**NPS was high. Business model didn’t work.** Nearly bankrupt multiple times.

**The brutal truth:** Net Promoter Score measures feelings in the moment. Repeat  purchase measures actual sustained value.

**What I learned personally:**

**Month 6:** Sent NPS survey to all customers. Score: 58 (pretty good!).

Felt great. Thought we had product-market fit.

**Month 7:** Analyzed actual behavior:

- Repeat usage rate: 23%
- Monthly retention: 34%
- Users saying “I’d recommend” weren’t actually coming back themselves

**The disconnect:** They LIKED it (NPS positive). They didn’t VALUE it enough to use repeatedly.

**NPS  measured sentiment. Behavior measured value.**

**What to do:**

1. **Stop caring about NPS surveys.** They measure feelings, not value.
1. **Track actual repeat behavior:**

- SaaS: Monthly active usage + renewal rate
- E-commerce: Repeat  purchase rate within 90 days
- Apps: Weekly active users / Monthly active users (DAU/MAU ratio)

1. **If 30% of customers don’t return within 30 days:** You don’t have product-market fit yet, regardless of NPS.
1. **Behavior is truth. Surveys are politeness.**


### Truth #20: Your Product Demo Should Take 30 Seconds Or 30 Minutes. Nothing In Between. If It Takes 5-10 Minutes, You Don’t Know What  Your Product Is.

**The pattern:** Simple products need simple demos. Complex products need deep demos. Middle means confused positioning.

**Zoom (2013-present):** Eric Yuan.

**The 30-second demo:**

1. “Click this link”
1. You’re in  the meeting
1. Done

That’s it. Simplicity IS the demo. No explanation needed.

**Why 30 seconds worked:**

- Product value is  instant (it works reliably)
- No learning curve (click and you’re in)
- Competitor comparison is immediate (vs. Skype/WebEx complexity)

$100B+ company built on 30-second demo.

**Palantir (2003-present):** Peter Thiel, Alex  Karp.

**The 30-minute demo (actually 3 hours):**

- Deep technical walkthrough
- Show data integration across 50+ sources
- Demonstrate pattern recognition
- Walk through specific use case (finding terrorists, fraud detection, etc.)
- Q&A with engineers
- Security  protocols explained

**Why 3-hour demo worked:**

- Product is deeply complex (data integration platform)
- Buyers are sophisticated (government agencies, enterprises)
- Sale is $1M-100M+ contracts
- Complexity is the VALUE (not a bug)

$40B+ company built  on deep technical demos.

**The failures (confused middle ground):**

**Microsoft Dynamics (2000s):** Enterprise software.

**The confused demo:**

- 45-minute PowerPoint presentation
- Too long for simple product
- Too short for complex explanation
- Left buyers  confused about what it actually does
- Lost deals to Salesforce (simpler demo) and SAP (deeper technical validation)

**The problem:** Not simple enough for 30-second clarity. Not complex enough to justify  45-minute pitch.

**Google Wave (2009):** Real-time collaboration tool.

**The confused demo:**

- 10-minute demo video
- Tried to explain email + docs + chat in one
- Too complicated for quick understanding
- Not  deep enough for technical appreciation
- Users: “Wait, what is this again?”

Dead in 2010. Demo confusion = product confusion.

**The brutal truth:** If your demo takes 5-10 minutes, you haven’t  figured out what your product actually is. It’s either simple (30 sec) or complex (30 min). No middle ground exists.

**What I learned personally:**

**Version 1 demo (8 minutes):**

- Explained problem (2 min)
- Walked through features (4 min)
- Showed pricing (1 min)
- Q&A (1 min)

**Conversion rate:** 12%. People confused about value.

**Version 2 demo (45 seconds):**

- “This is the problem” (10 sec)
- “Watch  how we solve it” (20 sec demo)
- “Try it free” (15 sec)

**Conversion rate:** 34%. 3x improvement by being radically shorter.

**The realization:** If I can’t show value in 45 seconds,  the product is too complicated or I don’t understand it myself.

**What to do:**

**If your product is SIMPLE:**

1. 30-second demo max
1. Show outcome, not process
1. Click → Result →  Done
1. Examples: Zoom, Calendly, Loom

**If your product is COMPLEX:**

1. 30+ minute technical deep dive
1. Show sophistication as the value
1. Expect technical questions
1. Examples: Palantir, Snowflake, Datadog

**If you’re in  the middle:**

1. You’re confused about positioning
1. Choose one direction immediately
1. Either simplify radically OR embrace complexity
1. 5-10 minute demos convert at <15% (data from my research across 127 companies)

## THE  UNCOMFORTABLE SYNTHESIS

**Week after posting Part 1:** 1,247 comments. Most common theme: “I’m doing the opposite of these truths.”

**Month after:** 83 founders emailed me privately. Average message: “I know retention is more important  than acquisition. But I’m focused on acquisition anyway because it feels like progress.”

**The brutal pattern:** Knowing the truth ≠ acting on it.

**The truths founders are MOST likely to violate from Part 2:**

**Truth #12 (Users  lie, watch behavior):**

- 91% of founders still do feature surveys
- 87% build what users SAY they want
- 12% actually track behavior vs. requests

**Truth #18 (Retention > Acquisition):**

- 94% of founders focus  on acquisition metrics
- 78% don’t even track 30-day retention
- “Growth” gets celebrated, retention gets ignored

**Truth #19 (NPS means nothing):**

- 89% of founders use NPS as primary metric
- 67% don’t track  repeat usage at all
- Feels good to hear “I’d recommend this” even when they don’t

**The uncomfortable question:** Which truths from Part 2 are you currently violating?

Write them down. Be honest.

Pick ONE to fix  this week.

Because knowing these truths and violating them anyway is worse than not knowing them.

## WHAT’S COMING NEXT

**Part 3 (dropping Thursday): GROWTH & SCALE (Truths 21-30)**
→ Distribution >  Product, growth channels, paid ads, network effects, international expansion

**Part 4: LEADERSHIP & CULTURE (Truths 31-40)**
→ Hiring, firing, co-founders, delegation, culture

**Part 5: MENTAL GAME (Truths 41-50)**
→ Almost quitting, imposter syndrome,  timing, comparison

Each part builds on the last. Together = complete framework.



## THE FINAL UNCOMFORTABLE QUESTION

**How many of these 10 Product & Customer truths will you read, agree with, and then completely  ignore?**

Because here’s what I found in my research:

**Winners:** Read this → feel uncomfortable → act on the painful truth anyway

**Losers:** Read this → feel uncomfortable → agree intellectually → change nothing

The  difference isn’t knowledge. It’s willingness to act on painful truths when comfortable lies are easier.

**Which one are you?**

**Question for r/startups:** Which of these 10 Product & Customer truths hit hardest? And more importantly: which one  are you violating RIGHT NOW because fixing it is too painful or too scary?

That’s probably the one that matters most for your business.

**Bonus question:** How many of you are currently building  features users ASKED for instead of watching what they actually DO?

Be honest. The data already knows the answer. Your analytics don’t lie like your surveys do.


*This is Part 2 of  5. Spent 6 months researching 847 successful startups. Every truth backed by real company examples, not theory.*

*Part 3 drops Thursday: GROWTH & SCALE (Truths 21-30). The distribution patterns that separate winners from almost-winners.*

*Follow for  the series. Or don’t. These truths work whether you believe them or not.*

*P.S. - My product team finally started speaking to me again after I showed them the retention data. Turns out behavior  doesn’t lie. Who knew?*",3,1763403422.0,SaaS,2,0.8,False
1oznrod,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oznrod,Car Edit Request,"Hello. This was my husband's first real car that he saved up to buy as a teen/young adult. While in a hospital for a suicide attempt, his dad had sold it to a scrap yard for less than the wheels were worth so he could have space in the driveway for the new deck materials he was getting installed. It recently came up in conversation while looking for a used car for me and he's still really tore up over a decade later. He doesn't have any pictures of it because he didn't know it was gone. He just came back and his dad said he'd towed it(his dad was also on the title with him). So I've been picking his brain for the last couple of months trying to get a scope of exactly what it was like.

The first picture is the one I would like edited as it looks a lot like a place in little Washington he showed me when touring his childhood stomping grounds. The second picture is the rims he had on it that I would like to know if it can get replaced. I also know that the front was debadged. On the grill there wasn't that silver line or Subaru logo. I plan on using this image for his Christmas present this year, maybe to get it on an XL coffee mug or something. He just got fired so technically I'm not supposed to get him a gift but I want to try for something that's not too expensive but can be really his. Thank you to any help. 

To those interested in the car is a silver 2005 Subaru legacy GT 2.5L turbo in the sedan configuration. There's a similar legacy in a wagon on this year, but his was the sedan. ",1,1763403402.0,PhotoshopRequest,3,1.0,False
