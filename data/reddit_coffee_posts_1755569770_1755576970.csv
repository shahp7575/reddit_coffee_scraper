  I COULDN’T SHUT OUT the screams. Darkness surrounded me. A terrible weight pressed into my chest, making me struggle for each breath as I lay drowning in my own blood. I sat up with a gasp, blinking into the shadows.  
  
  The screaming had stopped. The room became still, flooded with silence. I took a couple of painful swallows, trying to moisten my parched mouth. It took me a moment to realize that the screams had been my own, each cry clawing my throat until it was raw. I brought my hands up to my chest. My fingers moved along the surface of my shirt. The fabric was smooth, with no sign of rips or tears from the crossbow bolts. I couldn’t see well in the dim light, but I could tell this shirt wasn’t mine, or rather, wasn’t Shay’s borrowed sweater—the one I’d been wearing the night everything changed.  
  
  A blur of images rushed through my head. A blanket of snow. A dark forest. The pounding of drums. Howls calling me to the union.  
  
  The union. My blood grew cold. I’d run from my own destiny.  
  
  I’d run from Ren. The thought of the Bane alpha made my chest tighten, but when I dropped my face into my hands, another figure replaced him. A boy on his knees, blindfolded and bound, alone in the forest.  
  
  Shay.  
  
  I could hear his voice, feel the brush of his hands on my cheek as I’d slipped in and out of consciousness. What had happened? He’d left me alone in the dark for so long. . . . I was still alone. But where?  
  
  My eyes adjusted to the low light of the room. The cloudy skies filtered sunlight through tall leaded windows stretching the length of the opposite wall, tingeing pale shadows with a rose-hued gleam as I scanned the room for an exit, finding a tall oak door to the right of the bed. Ten, maybe fifteen feet from where I sat.  
  
  I managed to slow my breathing, but my heart was still pounding. Swinging my legs over the edge of the bed, I tentatively put weight on my feet. I had no trouble standing and felt each muscle spring back to life, coiled and taut, ready for anything.  
  
  I’d be able to fight, and kill, if I had to.  
  
  The sound of booted footsteps reached my ears. The knob turned and the door swung inward to reveal a man I’d seen only once before. He had thick hair, deep brown like the color of black coffee. The contours of his face were cut at strong, chiseled angles, slightly worn with lines and covered with the shadow of several days of unshaven, salt-and-pepper stubble—neglected but still appealing.  
  
  I’d last seen his face seconds before he coldcocked me with the pommel of his sword. My canines sharpened as a growl rumbled deep in my chest.  
  
  He opened his mouth to speak, but I shifted into a wolf, crouching low, snarling at him. I kept my fangs in plain view, a steady growl rolling out of my throat. I had two options: tear him to pieces or bolt past him. I was guessing I had only a few seconds to pick one.  
  
  His hand went to his waist, pushing back his long leather duster to rest on the hilt of a long, curving saber.  
  
  A fight it is.  
  
  My muscles quivered as I hunched down, angling for his throat.  
  
  “Wait.” He moved his hand off the hilt, lifting his palms in an attempt to pacify me.  
  
  I froze, stunned by the gesture and a little irked at his presumption. I wouldn’t be calmed that easily. After a quick snap of my fangs, I risked a glance toward the hall at his back.  
  
  “You don’t want to do that,” he said, stepping into my line of sight.  
  
  I answered with a growl.  
  
  And you don’t want to find out what I’m capable of when I’m cornered.  
  
  “I understand the impulse,” he continued, folding his arms over his chest, the sword in its scabbard. “You might get past me. Then you’ll run into a security detail at the end of the hall. And if you get past them—which I think you probably could, given that you’re an alpha—you’ll hit a larger group of guards at any of the exits.”  
  
  “Given that you’re an alpha.” How does he know who I am?  
  
  Still growling, I backed off, throwing a glance over my shoulder at the tall windows. I could easily smash through them. It would hurt, but as long as it wasn’t too high a drop, I’d survive.  
  
  “Not an option,” he said, glancing at the windows.  
  
  What is this guy? A mind reader?  
  
  “That’s at least a fifty-foot drop onto solid marble.” He took a step forward. I backed up again. “And no one here wants to see you get hurt.”  
  
  The growl died in my throat.  
  
  His voice dropped low and he spoke slowly. “If you’d shift back into human form, we could talk.”  
  
  I gnashed my teeth, frustrated, sidling along the floor. But we both knew I was feeling less sure of myself by the minute.  
  
  “If you try to run,” he continued, “we’ll be forced to kill you.”  
  
  He’d said it so calmly that it took a moment for me to process the words.  
  
  I let out a sharp bark of protest that turned to dark laughter as I shifted into human form.  
  
  “I thought no one here wanted to hurt me.”  
  
  One corner of his mouth crinkled. “We don’t. Calla, I’m Monroe.”  
  
  He took a step forward.  
  
  “Stay where you are,” I said, flashing my canines.  
  
  He didn’t come any closer.  
  
  “You haven’t tried  
to kill me yet,” I replied, still scanning the room for anything that would give me a tactical advantage. “But that doesn’t mean I can trust you. If I see that steel hanging from your belt move an inch, you lose an arm.”  
  
  He nodded.  
  
  Questions pounded in my skull, making my head ache. The sensation of breathlessness threatened to overwhelm me again. I couldn’t afford to panic. I also couldn’t afford to show any weakness.  
  
  Memories stirred deep within me, swirling beneath my skin and raising gooseflesh along my arms. Cries of pain echoed in my head. I shivered, seeing wraiths ooze around me like nebulous shadows while succubi screamed overhead. My blood went icy.  
  
  “Monroe! The boy is over here!”  
  
  “Where is Shay?”  
  
  I choked on his name, terror welling up in my throat as I waited for Monroe’s response.  
  
  Snatches from the past flitted through my mind, a blur of images that wouldn’t stay in focus. I struggled with the memories, trying to catch them and hold them in place so that I could make sense of what had happened, how I’d gotten here. I remembered racing through narrow halls, realizing we’d been cornered, and finding our way into the library at Rowan Estate. Shay’s uncle, Bosque Mar, eroding my outrage with doubts about what was happening to us.  
  
  Shay’s fingers clutched my hand so tightly it hurt. “Tell me who you really are.”  
  
  “I’m your uncle,” Bosque said calmly, walking toward us. “Your own flesh and blood.”  
  
  “Who are the Keepers?” Shay asked.  
  
  “Others like me, who want only to protect you. To help you,” Bosque replied. “Shay, you are not like other children. You have untapped abilities that you cannot begin to imagine. I can show you who you truly are. Teach you to use the power you have.”  
  
  “If you’re so invested in helping Shay, why was he the sacrifice at my union?” I pushed Shay behind me, shielding him from Bosque.  
  
  Bosque shook his head. “Another tragic misunderstanding. A test, Calla, of your loyalty to our noble cause. I thought we offered you the best of educations, but perhaps you aren’t familiar with Abraham’s trial with his son Isaac? Isn’t the sacrifice of one you love the ultimate gauge of your faith? Do you really believe we wanted Shay to die at your hands? We’ve asked you to be his protector.”  
  
  I began to shake. “You’re lying.”  
  
  “Am I?” Bosque smiled, and it almost looked kind. “After all you’ve been through, have you no trust in your masters? You would never have been made to harm Shay—another kill would have been provided in his place at the last moment. I understand such a test may seem too terrible to be fair, too much to ask of you and Renier. Perhaps you are too young to have faced such a trial.”  
  
  I balled my hands into fists so Monroe wouldn’t see them shaking. I could hear the screams of succubi and incubi, hear the hissing chimeras and the shuffling gait of those horrible, desiccated creatures that had crawled out of the portraits lining Rowan Estate’s walls.  
  
  “Where is he?” I asked again, grinding my teeth. “I swear if you don’t tell me—”  
  
  “He’s in our care,” Monroe said calmly.  
  
  There was that half smirk again. I couldn’t puzzle out this man’s reserved but confident demeanor.  
  
  I wasn’t sure what “care” meant in this case. Keeping my fangs bared, I edged across the room, waiting for Monroe to make a move. Even as I watched him, blurry images of the past wavered before my eyes like watercolors.  
  
  Cold metal encircling my arms. The click of locks and the sudden absence of weight from my wrists. The warmth of a gentle touch rubbing away the icy chill on my skin.  
  
  “Why isn’t she awake yet?” Shay asked. “You promised she wouldn’t be hurt.”  
  
  “She’ll be fine,” Monroe said. “The enchantment from the bolts acts like a heavy sedative; it will take some time to wear off.”  
  
  I tried to speak, to move, but my eyelids were so heavy, the darkness of slumber pulling me beneath its surface again.  
  
  “If we can reach an agreement, I’ll take you to him,” Monroe continued.  
  
  “An agreement?” I was right about not wanting to show weakness. If I was making any sort of deal with a Searcher, it had to be on my terms.  
  
  “Yes,” he said, risking a step toward me. When I didn’t protest, he began to smile. He wasn’t being deceptive—I didn’t catch the scent of fear—but his smile was chased away by something else. Pain?  
  
  “We need you, Calla.”  
  
  My confusion buzzed more loudly, forcing me to shake it off like a pesky swarm of flies. I had to appear confident, not distracted by his strange behavior.  
  
  “Who exactly is ‘we’? And what do you need me for?”  
  
  My anger had dissolved, but I concentrated on keeping my canines razor sharp. I didn’t want Monroe to forget for one minute who he was dealing with. I was still an alpha—I needed to remember that as much as he needed to see it. That strength was the only thing I had going for me right now.  
  
  “My people,” he said, vaguely gesturing behind him toward whatever lay beyond the door. “The Searchers.”  
  
  “You’re their leader?” I frowned.  
  
  He looked strong but grizzled—like someone who never got as much sleep as he really needed.  
  
  “I’m a leader,” he said. “I head up the Haldis team; we run operations out of the Denver outpost.”  
  
  “Let’s talk about your friends in Denver.”  
  
  Somewhere in the recesses of my mind, Lumine, my mistress, smiled and a Searcher screamed.  
  
  I crossed my arms over my chest so I wouldn’t shudder. “Okay.”  
  
  “But it’s not just my team that needs your help,” he continued, turning suddenly to pace in front of the door. “We all do. Everything has changed; we don’t have any time to waste.”  
  
  He ran his hands through his dark hair as he spoke. I considered bolting—he was clearly distracted—but something about his manner mesmerized me, enough so that I didn’t know if escape was what I really wanted anymore.  
  
  “You might be our only chance. I don’t think the Scion can do this alone. You might be the final part of the equation. The tipping point.”  
  
  “The tipping point of what?”  
  
  “This war. You can end it.”  
  
  War. The word set my blood boiling. I was glad for it; the heat coursing through my veins made me feel stronger. This war was the one I’d been raised to fight.  
  
  “We need you to join us, Calla.”  
  
  I could barely hear him. I was trapped in a red fog—thoughts of the violence that consumed so much of my life filled my being.  
  
  The Witches’ War.  
  
  I’d served the Keepers in their battles against the Searchers since I could cut flesh with my teeth. I’d hunted for them. I’d killed for them.  
  
  My eyes focused on Monroe. I’d killed his people. How could he possibly want me to join them?  
  
  As if sensing my wariness, he froze in place. He didn’t speak but clasped his hands behind his back, watching me, waiting for me to speak.  
  
  I swallowed, forcing steadiness into my voice. “You want me to fight for you.”  
  
  “Not just you,” he said. I could tell he was fighting to control his words as well. He seemed desperate to flood the air between us with his thoughts. “But you’re the key. You’re an alpha, a leader. That’s what we need. It’s what we’ve always needed.”  
  
  “I don’t understand.”  
  
  His eyes were so bright as he spoke I didn’t know whether to be afraid or fascinated. “The Guardians, Calla. Your pack. We need you to bring them over to us. To fight with us.”  
  
  It felt like the floor had dropped out beneath me and I was falling. I wanted to believe what he was saying, because wasn’t this the very thing I’d hoped for?  
  
  A way to free my pack.  
  
  Yes. Yes, it was. Even now my heart was racing with the thought of returning to Vail, of finding my packmates. Of getting back to Ren. I could take them all away from the Keepers. To something else. Something better.  
  
  But the Searchers were my enemi  
es . . . I could only tread carefully if I made a pact with them. I decided to play up my reluctance.  
  
  “I don’t know if that’s possible. . . .”  
  
  “But it is!” Monroe lurched forward as if to grab my hands, a mad glint in his eyes.  
  
  I leapt back, shifting into wolf form, and snapped at his fingers.  
  
  “I’m sorry.” He shook his head. “There’s so much you don’t know.”  
  
  I shifted back. His face was etched with deep lines. Haunted, full of secrets.  
  
  “No sudden moves, Monroe.” I took slow steps toward him, extending my hand, warding off another approach. “I’m interested, but I’m not convinced that you know what you’re asking of me.”  
  
  “I do.” He looked away, almost flinching at his own words. “I’m asking you to risk everything.”  
  
  “And why would I do that?” I asked.  
  
  I already knew the answer. I’d risked everything to save Shay. And I’d do it again in a heartbeat if it meant I could get back to my packmates. If I could save them.  
  
  He stepped back and extended his arm, clearing my path to the open door.  
  
  “Freedom.”  
  
  TWO  
  
  THE DOOR LED INTO A WIDE, well-lit hall and I swallowed a gasp. The walls were hewn from gleaming marble, its surfaces reflecting a glimmering veil of sunlight that spilled through glass.  
  
  Where am I?  
  
  The startling beauty of my surroundings distracted me enough that I failed to notice that Monroe and I weren’t the only ones in the hall.  
  
  “Heads up.” A distinctly sullen voice made me jump.  
  
  I turned, barely maintaining my human form, bristling with anger at being caught off guard. I almost shifted again when I saw the speaker.  
  
  Ethan. I’d met him twice and both times we’d been fighting. First at the library and then at Rowan Estate. My lips curled back so I could flash my fangs. Looking at him, I clenched my fist in front of my chest. His crossbow bolts had almost killed me before Monroe knocked me out. Ethan stared back at me, nose still slightly crooked from when Shay had broken it. Instead of marring his hardened good looks, it had the effect of making him seem that much more dangerous. My muscles quaked as I watched him. The slightest twitch of his fingers in the direction of the dagger sheathed at his waist was all it took.  
 I shifted as I leapt, my cry of outrage turning into a howl, mind a frenzy when I barreled into him.  
  
  Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Two kind words from Monroe and I’d walked right into an ambush.  
  
  Ethan’s fingers twisted in the fur at my chest, shoving me away so my fangs snapped just short of his throat. He spewed curses as he writhed beneath me. I wrenched free of his grasp, but before I could tear into his unprotected flesh, someone else slammed into my back.  
  
  Arms and legs wrapped around my torso, clinging tightly, refusing to let go. I snarled and bucked, twisting my head around as I tried to free myself of this new assailant. I couldn’t get a good look at the attacker nor could I manage to sink my teeth into the arm locked around my chest. A deep masculine whoop and the sound of laughter only fueled my rage. I crow-hopped and whirled in a circle, desperate to throw him off.  
  
  The laughter was coming from Ethan, who’d jumped to his feet and was watching me struggling with a satisfied smirk on his face.  
  
  “Ride ’em, cowboy! Only eight seconds, Connor, and you’re golden,” he said. “You’ve already made it to five.”  
  
  “Stop this!” Monroe loomed up between me and Ethan. “Calla, I gave you my word. You aren’t in danger here. Connor, get off her.”  
  
  I thrashed as the rumble of Connor’s laughter rippled through my back. “But Monroe, this is almost a new record for me.”  
  
  “Welcome to Wolf Rodeo.” Ethan was laughing so hard he’d bent over, hands resting on his knees so he wouldn’t fall.  
  
  “I said stop.” Nothing in Monroe’s voice was amused.  
  
  I was so startled when Connor slid off me that I continued to buck and nearly tumbled over.  
  
  “Whoa there, sleeping beauty.” I whipped around to find Connor grinning at me. I had no trouble remembering him: the other Searcher who’d ambushed Shay and me at the library. And he’d been at Rowan Estate as well, scooping up Shay—unconscious and a wolf—and whisking him away from Bosque’s onslaught of wraiths, succubi, and incubi. I shuddered, both at the memory of the horde and at the sick dread I still felt at not knowing what had happened to Shay.  
  
  Unlike Ethan, whose gaze had made me certain he wanted to stick a knife in my gut as much as I wanted to sink my teeth into his throat, Connor was working hard not to laugh. With that expression he looked boyishly appealing, even a little innocent, but I recalled too well the way he could wield swords. Two swords, curving sabers like Monroe’s, were sheathed at his waist at this very moment. I snarled at him, backing slowly away from the three Searchers.  
  
  “Not a morning person, are we?” Connor smiled. “I promise we’ll get you some breakfast, wolfie. You just can’t eat Ethan. Deal?”  
  
  “Calla.” Monroe was walking toward me, shaking his head. “We aren’t your enemies. Please give me a chance.”  
  
  I met his dark eyes, which had locked on me, intense and a little fearful. Pulling my gaze off Monroe, I glanced at Ethan and Connor. They’d taken flanking positions behind Monroe, but neither had drawn a weapon. Conflicting impulses paralyzed me. All my instincts were screaming to attack, but the Searchers had only acted defensively. And they weren’t trying to hurt me now.  
  
  Still uneasy, I shifted forms.  
  
  “I like her better this way, don’t you?” Connor murmured with a sideways glance at Ethan, who only grunted.  
  
  “What are they doing here?” I pointed at the other two men but spoke to Monroe. “I thought you said I’d be safe with you.”  
  
  “They’re members of my team,” Monroe answered. “And you’ll be working closely with them. You can trust them just as you can trust me.”  
  
  Now it was my turn to laugh. “No way. These two have tried to kill me more than once.”  
  
  “No more fighting now that we’re on the same team,” Connor said. “Scout’s honor.”  
  
  “Like you were ever a Boy Scout.” Ethan’s smile was there and gone in less than a second. “Besides, she just tried to tear my throat out!”  
  
  “Ethan.” Monroe spared him a stern glance.  
  
  But Ethan’s hostility offered me more reassurance than Monroe’s promises or Connor’s jibes; at least Ethan’s threats made sense. These were Searchers and I was a Guardian. What could we offer each other besides bloodshed?  
  
  “Calla,” Monroe said. “Our worlds are changing faster than you can imagine. Forget what you think you know about us. We can help each other. We all want the same things.”  
  
  I didn’t respond, wondering what exactly he thought I wanted.  
  
  “Will you come with us?” he asked. “Will you hear what I have to say?”  
  
  Pulling my eyes off him, I looked up and down the curving hall. Nothing was familiar. If I ran, I wouldn’t know where I was going. At least I could keep an eye out for an escape route while I was following Monroe around.  
  
  “Fine,” I said.  
  
  “Fantastic!” Connor laughed. “No more fighting! I guess that means we’re bosom buddies now? Very nice.”  
  
  With that he looked pointedly at my chest.  
  
  “She’s a wolf,” Ethan snapped. “That’s twisted.”  
  
  “Not at the moment,” Connor said, not moving his gaze and taking a few steps closer. As he drew near, I caught the scent of cedar and violet tinged with the aroma of coffee. The mixture was familiar—one I’d been close to before. I snarled and jumped back, shaking away the new cloud of memories forming in my mind.  
  
  “Are you sure she’s an alpha?” Connor asked, tucking me against his chest when I stirred. “She doesn’t look that tough.”  
  
  “You have a selective memory, moron,” Ethan snapped. “Just because she’s a pretty blonde now doesn’t mean the wolf is gone.”  
  
  “Silver lining, man.” Connor laughed. “Gotta live in the moment. And in this moment there is one fine-looking girl in my arms.”  
  
  “Stop talking about her like I’m not here!” Shay yelled.  
  
  “Oh, horrors, I’ve angered the Great One,” Connor said. “Will I ever gain his forgiveness?”  
  
  “Don’t push the boy, Connor,” Monroe said. “We’re nearly at the rendezvous point.”  
  
  “Sorry, boy.” Connor smirked.  
  
  “That’s it.” Shay snarled and I heard the scuffle of feet.  
  
  “Whoa!” Ethan’s body loomed in front of me. “Can’t let you do it, kid.”  
  
  “That’s enough,” Monroe said. “There’s the portal. Just go.”  
  
  I tried to move again, squinting to see more of my surroundings. The air seemed to sparkle; cold gave way to warmth. Connor’s arms tightened around me as I slipped into unconsciousness again.  
  
  Staring at Connor’s puckish smile, I knew I’d seen it before—even if the memory was fuzzy. He returned my gaze, eyes sparkling with mischief. I balled my fist, gauging whether I’d get the most satisfaction out of hitting him in the gut—or just a bit lower. If he wanted to avoid a fight, he’d need to bite his tongue around me.  
  
  But Monroe got there first. “Back off, Connor. She could use a little adjustment before she has to deal with your sense of humor.”  
  
  “Sir, yes, sir!” Connor stood at attention, but he was laughing.  
  
  I was back to being confused. Ethan grunted, still eyeing me warily, but he didn’t make a move. Apparently they weren’t looking for a fight. Having encountered these men only when I was trying to kill them, I couldn’t make heads or tails of their strange, casual banter. Who were these people?  
  
  “Anika’s expecting us in Tactical,” Monroe said, not quite masking his own laugh with a clearing of his throat. He turned away and headed down the hall. “Let’s go.”  
  
  I practically had to trot to keep up with him. I still wasn’t comfortable with Connor and Ethan at my back. It took a lot of willpower to keep from looking over my shoulder at them, if only to bare my teeth in warning.  
  
  The farther we walked, the more confused I became. The hallway curved constantly; we passed many doors, but no corners or turns. Whatever this place was, it seemed to be circular, all of it flooded with sunlight, brightening every minute as morning blossome  
d into day. I had to blink against the light, which glittered in the air. Even the walls were sparkling. Tiny veins of multi-hued crystals ran through the marble floors and walls, slicing through the surfaces in rivers of color that joined with sunbeams to fill the space with ghostly rainbows. The hypnotic patterns of light held my focus, so when Monroe came to an abrupt stop, I just avoided smacking into him.  
  
  We’d reached a point where the curving hallway was interrupted by a broad open chamber with new paths that led off to our right and left. The path on our left, which headed into what must have been the center of the building, wasn’t a hall but glass doors that opened onto a bridge of the same marble. My eyes followed the carved stone walkway and I lost my breath at what I saw. The walls dropped away to reveal an immense courtyard below. It must have been fifty, maybe sixty feet to the ground.  
  
  Looks like Monroe was telling the truth about the windows.  
  
  The courtyard was filled with . . . glass houses and gardens? They looked like gardens, but there weren’t any growing plants. Then again, it was almost winter. Or was it? How long had I been here?  
  
  I looked up and saw that unlike the hallway we’d followed to this point, the courtyard opened up to the sky itself. On the other side of the glass doors, thin flakes of snow drifted lazily to the dark earth below.  
  
  A hand touched my shoulder and I jumped.  
  
  “Business first.” Monroe was smiling. “I promise you’ll have a tour later.”  
  
  “Right,” I said, following him down the hall to our right. A blush bit into my cheeks, and I hoped I hadn’t looked too dumbstruck when I’d been ogling the building.  
  
  This new hall was much wider than the one we’d come from, and unlike the first hall it was straight. There were doors on my right and left and two solid wooden ones directly ahead of us. When we reached them, I gasped. Carved in each tall surface was the alchemical symbol for earth—the same triangle that had marked Haldis Cavern on the pages of The War of All Against All.  
  
  “She’s done her homework,” Connor said. “Silas will be thrilled.”  
  
  Monroe and Ethan ignored him and I bit my lip, trying to remember that I needed to keep my reactions hidden. But all such thoughts fled when Monroe pushed open the doors. We walked into a great room with a single table in the center. It was round and massive, like something that had been lifted out of King Arthur’s court. The walls were lined with books—old and leather bound, like those we’d hunted through at Rowan Estate. The similarity was enough to set my teeth on edge.  
  
  Out of the corner of my eye I saw two people standing near a set of bookshelves, talking quietly as they looked over the titles on the spines. And one of the two people was someone I knew. And loved.  
  
  Shay’s head tilted as he listened to the girl with him. She looked about my age and had large liquid brown eyes half veiled by wisps of mahogany hair that had escaped from the thick knot caught with a metal clasp at the back of her neck. The girl was the first Searcher I’d seen who wasn’t armed to the teeth, though, like the others, she was dressed in fierce apparel: heavily worn leather pants, thick-heeled boots, and a close-cut tunic of undyed linen. Clothes just like those I was now wearing. Slung low on her hips was a wide belt, from which two strange, slender metal spikes hung. I couldn’t puzzle out what they were. About two feet long, they looked like skinny, bright silver railroad ties that tapered to needle-sharp points. In one hand she held a sheaf of folded papers, which she tapped rhythmically against her thigh.  
  
  I bristled when I saw her other hand resting on Shay’s arm. Jealousy’s bite startled me, and its teeth sank in deeply. I didn’t want any other girl touching him. He was mine.  
  
  Shay lifted his head as if he’d heard my thoughts. But when he turned, I realized that he’d recognized my scent. The thought made my skin hum and I found myself running to meet him, casting the dark-haired girl a menacing look as I pushed past her.  
  
  “Calla!” Shay said, reaching for me. “Are you all right?”  
  
  My heart was beating too fast and I could barely catch my breath. I’d been afraid I might not see him again. That neither of us would live through this ordeal.  
  
  I started to nod just as my legs gave out, but Shay was there. His arms caught my waist as I collapsed. I clung to him, knowing that he was as strong as I was now. I could crush him in my grip without fear that I might hurt him. Shay tightened his arms around me and I pressed closer. One of his hands came up and cradled my head against his chest, his lips brushing the crown of my hair.  
  
  Shay. Shay. I took a deep breath. His scent, the scent of spring, warm and hopeful as the sunlight that filled this place, poured through me.  
  
  Burying my fingers in his hair, I pulled his face to mine. I could taste his surprise, sweet and bright, when I kissed him. The sweetness turned to warmth, then heat as his mouth trailed over my cheek.  
  
  “Calla,” he whispered, catching my earlobe in his teeth—a wolfish gesture that made me nuzzle his neck affectionately. Mine. He is mine.  
  
  “It was killing me that I couldn’t be with you,” he said, pulling back so he could look at me. “God, it’s good to see you.”  
  
  Connor whistled, and the girl’s curious gaze sparkled with mischief. Despite my relief at Shay’s presence, I silently cursed the momentary lapse in caution. I should know better. This wasn’t a private reunion. Our every move was being observed. I’d missed Shay, every ounce of my being ached with wanting to touch him from the moment I laid eyes on him, but I didn’t need the Searchers to know that. I forced steadiness into my muscles, wriggling out of his embrace.  
  
  “I’m fine, Shay,” I said, trying to ignore the wrench of loss I felt now that he wasn’t holding me. “For the most part. A little confused.”  
  
  “That’s why we’re here,” Monroe said, coming toward us. “Shay, I trust you’re well.”  
  
  “I’m better now,” he said, not taking his eyes off me. My toes curled as he ignored my attempt to distance myself and pulled me back into an embrace.  
  
  “I’m pleased that Calla has made a full recovery too,” Monroe said. “It would have been tragic if we’d lost her.”  
  
  I barked out a harsh laugh. “Lost me? I seem to remember being shot by him.” Ethan didn’t flinch when I threw an accusing glare his way before looking back at Monroe. “And that you knocked me out.”  
  
  He nodded, offering an apologetic smile. “We needed to know more about who you were before we knew if you could be an ally.”  
  
  I cast him a suspicious glance.  
  
  “And we did everything in our power to ensure that you recovered swiftly.”  
  
  This time it was Shay who snorted. “Yeah, like I have any reason to trust your healers.”  
  
  I turned in his arms to look at him. “Healers?”  
  
  My memories of the time between the battle at Rowan Estate and waking here were jumbled at best, terrifying at worst. It was obvious something had healed me, but I didn’t remember when my wounds had been treated.  
  
  “I don’t know what they did to you.” He shot an angry look at Monroe, who shrugged.  
  
  “The bolts kept her under for a long time,” Monroe said. “That’s what they’re designed to do. Our healers made sure all the toxins were removed from her blood. There shouldn’t be any lingering effects.”  
  
  I howled, struggling across the floor to his side. Each step was agony. The crossbow bolts still protruded from my chest. The blood in my lungs was slowly drowning me.  
  
  When I reached him, I shifted forms, buried my hands in his fur, and shook his shoulders.  
  
  “Shay! Shay!” Even as I clung to him, I could feel strength ebbing from my limbs.  
  
  “Enchanted bolts; hope you’re enjoying the ride.” Ethan’s gravel-rough voice drew my eyes to the side. He had the crossbow trained on me once more. “Are you the one who turned him?”  
  
  My chest was on fire, my vision blurred. I nodded and slumped to the floor, rolling alongside Shay.  
  
  My fingers flew to my chest again, which had tightened at the memory, at the thought of bolts piercing my flesh.  
Kept me under?  
  
  “How long?” I whispered.  
  
  “What?” Shay had put his hand over mine, curling my fingers in his own.  
  
  “How long was I out?” I asked. “How long since we left Vail?”  
  
  “About a week,” he said.  
  
  A week. In some ways it didn’t sound like much time at all. But when I thought of what could have happened to my pack in a week, what could have happened to them in a matter of hours once my flight from the union had been discovered, it sounded like an eternity.  
  
  And Ren. What had they done to him? He’d lied so we could escape the pursuing Bane pack, and there was no way the Keepers hadn’t discovered that treachery.  
  
  I trembled and Shay tightened his grip on me, but in my mind I was in the arms of someone else.  
  
  Ren’s voice seemed to come from right behind me.  
  
  “I don’t know how to believe you. Any of this. What else is there? This is who we are.”  
  
  “That doesn’t make it right. You know I wouldn’t abandon my pack unless I had to,” I said quietly. “Unless it was the only way to help them.”  
  
  His eyes met mine, strained and uncertain.  
  
  “We don’t have much time,” I said. “How did you get ahead of the others?”  
  
  He glanced in the direction from which we’d come. “There was an uproar when they found Flynn’s body, but I caught your scent and took off. The rest of them were still regrouping. My father’s pack. The elder Banes.”  
  
  He tensed and cold flooded my limbs.  
  
  “What about the Nightshades?” I asked.  
  
  “They’re being held for questioning.”  
  
  “What happened in Vail?” I had to pull away from Shay, needing to get my bearings.  
  
  No one answered me, and I fought off a chill like the one I’d felt the night of our escape.

1mu8cin,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialLiteracyPH/comments/1mu8cin/needs_vs_wants_delayed_gratification_and/,"Needs vs Wants, Delayed Gratification, and Self-Limiting Beliefs (A Pinoy Money Mindset Deep Dive)","Real talk: money problems aren’t always about income. A lot of the struggle comes from **mindset**—how we label expenses, how patient we are, and what we believe is “possible” for us. Here’s a deeper look:

---

## 1) Needs vs. Wants — The Everyday Decision Trap
**Common disguises:**
- “I *need* a new phone for work.” (Do you need flagship, or just reliable?)
- “Eating out is faster.” (Two extra baon days a week = thousands saved monthly.)
- “It’s on sale, sayang.” (It’s not savings if you didn’t plan to buy it.)

**Simple filters that work:**
- **Rule of 5 (Wardrobe):** If a clothing item can’t pair with 5 things you already own, skip.
- **30-Use Rule:** If you don’t realistically see yourself using it 30+ times, it’s a want.
- **Budget Labels:** Tag recurring wants in your tracker (e.g., ☕, 🚖, 🍱). Seeing patterns = power.

**Micro-habit ideas:**
- Put *wants* in a **wishlist** for 14–30 days. If you still want it after, buy guilt-free.
- Use **cash envelopes** (or digital “buckets”) for categories that tend to overflow: food delivery, ride-hailing, “budol.”

---

## 2) Delayed Gratification — The Unsexy Superpower
**Why it’s hard:** dopamine now > benefits later.  
**Why it works:** small delays compound into big outcomes.

**Practical swaps:**
- **Daily treats → Weekly treats:** Don’t cut joy; batch it. One great coffee > 5 rushed ones.
- **Upgrade path, not leap:** Mid-range phone now, invest the difference; upgrade *when needed*, not when hyped.
- **Add “friction”:** Uninstall shopping apps for 30 days; remove saved cards; turn off “buy now.”

**Mini challenges to try:**
- **No-Spend Weekends:** Pre-plan free fun (walks, workouts, cooking).  
- **5-for-1 Rule:** For every 5 wants declined, allow 1 guilt-free purchase.  
- **Auto-save, then spend:** Salary hits → % auto-moves to savings. Spend what’s left, not the other way around.

---

## 3) Self-Limiting Beliefs — Quiet Budget Killers
**Beliefs that keep us stuck:**
- “Pang-mayaman lang ang investing.”  
- “Hindi kaya sa sweldo ko.”  
- “I’m just not a money person.”

**Reframes that help:**
- **From identity to action:** “I save ₱50/day” > “I’m bad at saving.”  
- **From all-or-nothing to incremental:** 1% better per month beats zero.  
- **From vague goals to receipts:** Write goals *and* the next 2 steps (what, when, how much).

**Reality check (balanced take):**
- Financial literacy doesn’t replace fair wages—but it multiplies whatever you earn.
- If income can’t cover basics, **optimize + upskill**: side gigs, certs, negotiations, or a new role with better WLB and pay.

---

## Quick Frameworks You Can Steal
- **50/30/20 (or 60/20/20):** Needs/Wants/Saving—tweak to fit real life.
- **Pay Yourself First:** Auto-save at payday (out of sight, out of mind).
- **Sinking Funds:** Small, regular set-asides for travel, gadgets, gifts—so wants don’t nuke your budget.
- **One-In, One-Out:** New item in? One old item out. Keeps both gastos *and* clutter down.

---

## TL;DR

*Most budgets break on wants disguised as needs. Tiny delays today create outsized freedom tomorrow. Don’t let “pang-mayaman lang ’yan” thinking decide your future.*

---

## Over to You (Help This Thread Help Others)
- What mindset shift helped you the most?  
- What’s your personal **filter** for needs vs wants?  
- What’s one **friction** you added that instantly cut gastos?

But I blew into town with a storm gnawin’ at my heels, thunder barkin’ close enough to make windows rattle. First thought on my mind was food. Beth’s — a traveler’s first-and-last stop for a hundred miles any way you fly is the bastard cross between truck stop, diner, and motel.



Beth herself reminded me of Sal right off — a mother hen fattenin’ up strays, eyes sharp enough to know what kind of trouble you’re haulin’ but kind enough not to ask.



She fed me to the gills with pie. My God, that woman can bake — crust flakin’ like it owed her money, sugar sweet enough to wash the road dust from my bones.



Night rolled in with the storm. I holed up in one of the ramshackle huts they got the gall to call rooms. Roof leaked in two corners, wallpaper curlin’ like it was tryin’ to escape, but hell — the bed was clean, sheets smelled more of bleach than sweat, and no pests came crawlin’ out to greet me. That’s a win in my book.



Breakfast was cheap, coffee was free — tar black, bitter as old sin — but it kept the wheels turnin’.



Local crowd was about as colorful as you’d expect early on a Friday mornin’… least, I think it was a Friday. Days get slippery in Mayvale, slidin’ past like cards in a crooked shuffle. Folks nursed the coffee like medicine, eyes glued anywhere but each other, and I got the sense half of ‘em weren’t awake... and the other half wished they weren’t.



That’s when I crossed paths with Shamblin’ Joe. Old gator hunter by trade, though trade’s a kind word for it. Luck soured on him the day Big Bess clamped down and near took his leg clean off. Now he hobbles ‘round Mayvale like a bad omen with a grin too wide for his own good. Talks more to his flask than to folks, but I’ll be damned if he don’t know things he shouldn’t.



Joe laid three truths on me that morning, straight gospel and twice as heavy. Don’t go pokin’ at whatever’s stirrin’ over at the high school. Cross the rainbow if I had a death wish. And last -maybe worst of all - you can’t always save Bishop. He didn’t explain, just let it hang in the smoke between us, like I oughta already know.



Well, I know now, don’t I? Ain’t no clearer way to put it - school’s crawlin’ with heart-eatin’ Aztecs wearin’ letterman jackets like it’s the most natural thing in the world. And as for rainbows - hell, if I never lay eyes on one again, it’ll still be too soon.



But those came later - after the wheels came off and Mayvale showed its real teeth.



\[Dhyng’s addendum: The original notebook ends abruptly here. The rest of the sheet is torn, browned, and stained. Subsequent fragments appear to continue the same narrative, though the medium varies. Linking is tentative. Caffeine intake request submitted\]

Presented to you is a collection of torn pages from a standard school notebook and random refuse. Several sheets are splattered with an indiscernible sticky residue - dark in patches and tacky to the touch. The first page presented to you starts:



\[Illegible text\]... with great care. But I noticed the teens \[Slanted? Leered?\] at me as I moseyed about, all narrowed eyes and chewin’ mouths... Not what I would expect in a berg like this.



Crime's s’posed to come with size \[Rest of sentence missing.\]



\[Tumbled out? Turned up?\] at the old fairgrounds at some point later on in my walkabout. Dead rides groanin’ in the wind, weeds growin’ up where the ticket booths used to be, smell of rust and popcorn long gone stale. Met the clowns there - paint cracked, suits hangin’ loose, eyes clear as a winter morning. Probably only sensible people in this whole \[Town? Country? Text missing.\] got names, minds, rules - more than I can say for most of Mayvale.



Greeted by a man went by Mad Hatter, iron handshake like he was testing the bones in my hand just to count 'em, and a laugh that tolled through the dead rides like a church bell nobody asked for.



Treated me better than Kin, he did. Don't trust him further than I could throw him. 



Never trust the Prince among paupers.



\[Section following this sentence is heavily stained and unreadable.\]



\[Fragment retrieved from the remains of a crumbling bank vault.\]



Leaving Hatter’s was a ride, lemme tell you. Man’s got a way of makin’ you feel like family while he’s slippin’ a knife between your ribs - not literal, but the kind that digs in deep all the same. Walkin’ outta that fairground, I had the itch between my shoulders, like spider silk strands tied me to the dead rides with him holdin’ the knots.



\[A portion of text is unreadable due to smudging.\]



Sorry, heard somethin’ at the door and had to check the locks. Can’t be too careful right now - shadows will lean in too close if you ain’t lookin’.



But where was I… ah, yeah.



Beth was waitin’ with pie and a cuppa joe when I stumbled back - like she knew the cold had wormed its way clear to my bones. Steam curled off that mug like a blessing, and the pie - hell, salvation and just the right kind of sweet to scrub the aftertaste of the Mad Prince clean outta my mouth… and every bit loosened the lingerin' web. Sittin’ there under her watch, with pie in my gut and steam in the air - I felt almost human again. Even if the walls listened. 



\[Document ends abruptly in the middle of a page\]



\[Scrawled diagonally on a napkin behind a forgery of The Last Supper, date unclear.\]



Woke up to scratching under the floorboards… again. Ain’t the first night, won’t be the last. The old woman next door swears it’s rats - but, sin above, I’ve known rats. Rats don’t whisper.



Reckon it might be time to move on. Been roostin’ here longer than’s healthy for me. But Mayvale’s a hard place to find a safe nest - tough peanuts in a town where every shadow’s already claimed and you don't wanna meet the landlords.



Maybe I oughta talk to Bishop again. Don’t sit right sayin’ it out loud, but there’s somethin’ about the man - like he’s carryin’ a lantern only he can see by. Most times I’d cross the street to dodge a sermon, but here? Maybe a fool preachin’ hope is better company than the whispers under the floorboards.



\[One of many index cards mistakenly labeled under FRUITCAKE RECIPES - either an archivist’s joke or someone in Mayvale’s got a twisted sense of holiday cheer.\]



\[Illegible text\] ... Mayvale general store - sells anything you might need in rural nowhere and a few things that’d make you wonder who the hell hauled ‘em here - and why. Soft-faced cashier ain’t said a peep since I blew in, just rings me up with them same glassy blue eyes every time and a smile so vacant it could rent rooms - and I keep goin’ back ‘cause I wanna see what moves in.



Whole damn'd place is the size of a \[Matchbox? Transcription unclear. Could be 'coffin'.\]… and yet it took me a half hour to find the door.



\[A pen sketch of a youth surrounded by cigarettes graces the back.\]



\[Crumpled and half burned, this fragment crumbles slightly under touch.\]



Bishop’s a god-damned bible-thumpin’ preacher, the kind that looks you straight through like he’s takin’ stock of your sins before you’ve even opened your mouth. Laughed myself near sick when he asked if he could save my soul. Told him he’d need a bigger net. If the clowns are the sanity in this madhouse, then Bishop’s the faith - standin’ tall, hollerin’ scripture into the wind, like words alone could keep the dark at bay.



Or maybe preachers burn brightest on the way down.

  The grease-slicked hair is a dead giveaway—no pun intended.  
  
  So is the loose and faded leather coat, though not as much that as the sideburns. And the way he keeps nodding and flicking his Zippo open and closed in rhythm with his head. He belongs in a chorus line of dancing Jets and Sharks.  
  
  Then again, I have an eye for these things. I know what to look for, because I’ve seen just about every variety of spook and specter you can imagine.  
  
  The hitchhiker haunts a stretch of winding North Carolina road, bordered by unpainted split-rail fences and a whole lot of nothing. Unsuspecting drivers probably pick him up out of boredom, thinking he’s just some college kid who reads too much Kerouac.  
  
  “My gal, she’s waiting for me,” he says now in an excited voice, like he’s going to see her the minute we crest the next hill. He taps the lighter hard on the dash, twice, and I glance over to make sure he hasn’t left a ding in the panel. This isn’t my car. And I’ve suffered through eight weeks of lawn work for Mr. Dean, the retired army colonel who lives down the block, just so I could borrow it. For a seventy-year-old man he’s got the straightest back I’ve ever seen. If I had more time, I could’ve spent a summer listening to interesting stories about Vietnam. Instead I cleared shrubs and tilled an eight-by-ten plot for new rosebushes while he watched me with a surly eye, making sure his baby would be safe with this seventeen-year-old kid in an old Rolling Stones t-shirt and his mother’s gardening gloves.  
  
  To tell the truth, knowing what I was going to use the car for, I felt a little guilty. It’s a dusk blue 1969 Camaro Rally Sport, mint condition. Drives smooth as silk and growls around curves. I can’t believe he let me take it, yard work or no. But thank god he did, because without it I would have been sunk. It was something the hitchhiker would go for—something worth the trouble of crawling out of the ground.  
  
  “She must be pretty nice,” I say without much interest.  
  
  “Yeah, man, yeah,” he says and, for the hundredth time since I picked him up five miles ago, I wonder how anyone could possibly not know that he’s dead. He sounds like a James Dean movie. And then there’s the smell. Not quite rotten but definitely mossy, hanging around him like a fog. How has anyone mistaken him for the living? How has anyone kept him in the car for the ten miles it takes to get to the Lowren’s Bridge, where he inevitably grabs the wheel and takes both car and driver into the river? Most likely they were creeped out by his clothes and his voice, and by the smell of bones—that smell they seem to know even though they’ve probably never smelled it. But by then it’s always too late. They’d made the decision to pick up a hitchhiker, and they weren’t about to let themselves be scared into going back on it. They rationalized their fears away. People shouldn’t do that.  
  
  In the passenger seat, the hitchhiker is still talking in this faraway voice about his girl back home, somebody named Lisa, and how she’s got the shiniest blond hair and the prettiest red smile, and how they’re going to run off and get married as soon as he gets back hitching from Florida. He was working part of a summer down there for his uncle at a car dealership: the best opportunity to save up for their wedding, even if it did mean they wouldn’t see each other for months.  
  
  “It must’ve been hard, being away from home so long,” I say, and there’s actually a little bit of pity in my voice. “But I’m sure she’ll be glad to see you.”  
  
  “Yeah, man. That’s what I’m talking about. I’ve got everything we need, right in my jacket pocket. We’ll get married and move out to the coast. I’ve got a pal out there, Robby. We can stay with him until I get a job working on cars.”  
  
  “Sure,” I say. The hitchhiker has this sadly optimistic look on his face, lit up by the moon and the glowing dashlights. He never saw Robby, of course. He never saw his girl Lisa, either. Because two miles up the road in the summer of 1970, he got into a car, probably a lot like this one. And he told whoever was driving that he had a way to start an entire life in his coat pocket.  
  
  The locals say that they beat him up pretty good by the bridge and then dragged him back into the trees, where they stabbed him a couple of times and then cut his throat. They pushed his body down an embankment and into one of the tributary streams. That’s where a farmer found it, nearly six months later, wound around with vines, the jaw hanging open in surprise, like he still couldn’t believe that he was stuck there.  
  
  And now he doesn’t know that he’s stuck here. None of them ever seem to know. Right now the hitchhiker is whistling and bobbing along to nonexistent music. He probably still hears whatever they were playing the night they killed him.  
  
  He’s perfectly pleasant. A nice guy to ride with. But when we get to that bridge, he’ll be as angry and ugly as anyone you’ve ever seen. It’s reported that his ghost, dubbed unoriginally as the County 12 Hiker, has killed at least a dozen people and injured another eight. But I can’t really blame him. He never made it home to see his girl, and now he doesn’t want anyone else to get home either.  
  
  We pass mile marker twenty-three—the bridge is less than two minutes away. I’ve driven this road almost every night since we moved here in the hopes that I would catch his thumb in my headlights, but I had no luck. Not until I got behind the wheel of this Rally Sport. Before this it was just half a summer of the same damn road, the same damn blade tucked under my leg. I hate it when it’s like that, like some kind of horribly extended fishing trip. But I don’t give up on them. They always come around in the end.  
  
  I let my foot ease up on the gas.  
  
  “Something wrong, friend?” he asks me.  
  
  I shake my head. “Only that this isn’t my car, and I don’t have the cash to fix it if you decide to try to take me off the bridge.”  
  
  The hitchhiker laughs, just a little too loudly to be normal. “I think you’ve been drinking or something tonight, pal. Maybe you ought to just let me off here.”  
  
  I realize too late that I shouldn’t have said that. I can’t let him out. It’d be my luck that he’d step out and disappear. I’m going to have to kill him while the car is moving or I’ll have to do this all over again, and I doubt that Mr. Dean is willing to let the car go for too many more nights. Besides, I’m moving to Thunder Bay in three days.  
  
  There’s also the thought that I’m doing this to this poor bastard all over again. But that thought is fleeting. He’s already dead.  
  
  I try to keep the speedometer over fifty—too fast for him to really consider jumping out, but with ghosts you can never be sure. I’ll have to work fast.  
  
  It’s when I reach down to take my blade out from under the leg of my jeans that I see the silhouette of the bridge in the moonlight. Right on cue, the hitchhiker grabs the wheel and yanks it to the left. I try to jerk it back right and slam my foot on the brake. I hear the sound of angry rubber on asphalt and out of the corner of my eye I can see that the hitchhiker’s face is gone. No more easy Joe, no slicked hai  
r and eager smile. He’s just a mask of rotten skin and bare, black holes, with teeth like dull stones. It looks like he’s grinning, but it might just be the effect of his lips peeling off.  
  
  Even as the car is fishtailing and trying to stop, I don’t have any flashes of my life before my eyes. What would that even be like? A highlight reel of murdered ghosts. Instead I see a series of quick, ordered images of my dead body: one with the steering wheel through my chest, another with my head gone as the rest of me hangs out the missing window.  
  
  A tree comes up out of nowhere, aimed right for my driver’s side door. I don’t have time to swear, just to jerk the wheel and hit the gas, and the tree is behind me. What I don’t want to do is make it to the bridge. The car is all over the shoulder and the bridge doesn’t have one. It’s narrow, and wooden, and outdated.  
  
  “It’s not so bad, being dead,” the hitchhiker says to me, clawing at my arm, trying to get me off the wheel.  
  
  “What about the smell?” I hiss. Through all of this I haven’t lost my grip on my knife handle. Don’t ask me how; my wrist feels like the bones are going to separate in about ten seconds, and I’ve been pulled off my seat so that I’m hovering over the stick shift. I throw the car into neutral with my hip (should have done that earlier) and pull my blade out fast.  
  
  What happens next is kind of a surprise: the skin comes back onto the hitchhiker’s face, and the green comes back into his eyes. He’s just a kid, staring at my knife. I get the car back under control and hit the brakes.  
  
  The jolt from the stop makes him blink. He looks at me.  
  
  “I worked all summer for this money,” he says softly. “My girl will kill me if I lose it.”  
  
  My heart is pounding from the effort of controlling the lurching car. I don’t want to say anything. I just want to get it over with. But instead I hear my voice.  
  
  “Your girl will forgive you. I promise.” The knife, my father’s athame, is light in my hand.  
  
  “I don’t want to do this again,” the hitchhiker whispers.  
  
  “This is the last time,” I say, and then I strike, drawing the blade across his throat, opening a yawning black line. The hitchhiker’s fingers come up to his neck. They try to press the skin back together, but something as dark and thick as oil floods out of the wound and covers him, bleeding not only down over his vintage-era jacket but also up over his face and eyes, into his hair. The hitchhiker doesn’t scream as he shrivels, but maybe he can’t: his throat was cut and the black fluid has worked its way into his mouth. In less than a minute he’s gone, leaving not a trace behind.  
  
  I pass my hand over the seat. It’s dry. Then I get out of the car and do a walk-around as best I can in the dark, looking for scratches. The tire tread is still smoking and melted. I can hear Mr. Dean’s teeth grinding. I’m leaving town in three days, and now I’ll be spending at least one of them putting on a new set of Goodyears. Come to think of it, maybe I shouldn’t take the car back until the new tires are on.  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  It’s after midnight when I park the Rally Sport in our driveway. Mr. Dean’s probably still up, wiry and full of black coffee as he is, watching me cruise carefully down the street. But he doesn’t expect the car back until morning. If I get up early enough, I can take it down to the shop and replace the tires before he knows any different.  
  
  As the headlights cut through the yard and splash onto the face of the house, I see two green dots: the eyes of my mom’s cat. When I get to the front door, it’s gone from the window. It’ll tell her that I’m home. Tybalt is the cat’s name. It’s an unruly thing, and it doesn’t much care for me. I don’t care much for it either. It has a weird habit of pulling all the hair off its tail, leaving little tufts of black all over the house. But my mom likes to have a cat around. Like most children, they can see and hear things that are already dead. A handy trick, when you live with us.  
  
  I go inside, take my shoes off, and climb the stairs by two. I’m dying for a shower—want to get that mossy, rotten feeling off my wrist and shoulder. And I want to check my dad’s athame and rinse off whatever black stuff might be on the edge.  
  
  At the top of the stairs, I stumble against a box and say, “Shit!” a little too loudly. I should know better. My life is lived in a maze of packed boxes. My mom and I are professional packers; we don’t mess around with castoff cardboard from the grocery or liquor stores. We have high-grade, industrial-strength, reinforced boxes with permanent labels. Even in the dark I can see that I just tripped over the Kitchen Utensils (2).  
  
  I tiptoe into the bathroom and pull my knife out of my leather backpack. After I finished off the hitchhiker I wrapped it up in a black velvet cloth, but not neatly. I was in a hurry. I didn’t want to be on the road anymore, or anywhere near the bridge. Seeing the hitchhiker disintegrate didn’t scare me. I’ve seen worse. But it isn’t the kind of thing you get used to.  
  
  “Cas?”  
  
  I look up into the mirror and see the sleepy reflection of my mom, holding the black cat in her arms. I put the athame down on the counter.  
  
  “Hey, Mom. Sorry to wake you.”  
  
  “You know I like to be up when you come in anyway. You should always wake me, so I can sleep.”  
  
  I don’t tell her how dumb that sounds; I just turn on the faucet and start to run the blade under the cold water.  
  
  “I’ll do it,” she says, and touches my arm. Then of course she grabs my wrist, because she can see the bruises that are starting to purple up all along my forearm.  
  
  I expect her to say something motherly; I expect her to quack around like a worried duck for a few minutes and go to the kitchen to get ice and a wet towel, even though the bruises are by no means the worst mark I’ve ever gotten. But this time she doesn’t. Maybe because it’s late, and she’s tired. Or maybe because after three years she’s finally starting to figure out that I’m not going to quit.  
  
  “Give it to me,” she says, and I do, because I’ve gotten the worst of the black stuff off already. She takes it and leaves. I know that she’s off to do what she does every time, which is to boil the blade and then stab it into a big jar of salt, where it will sit under the light of the moon for three days. When she takes it out she’ll wipe it down with cinnamon oil and call it good as new.  
  
  She used to do the same thing for my dad. He’d come home from killing something that was already dead and she’d kiss him on the cheek and take away the athame, as casually as any wife might carry in a briefcase. He and I used to stare at the thing while it sat in its jar of salt, our arms crossed over our chests, conveying to each other that we both thought it was ridiculous. It always seemed to me like an exercise in make-believe. Like it was Excalibur in the rock.  
  
  But my dad let her do it. He knew what he was getting into when he met and married her, a pretty, auburn-haired Wiccan girl with a strand of white flowers braided around her neck. He’d lied back then and called himself Wiccan too, for lack of a better word. But really, Dad wasn’t much of anything.  
  
  He just loved the legends. He loved a good story, tales about the world that made it seem cooler than it really was. He went crazy over Greek mythology, which is where I got my name.  
  
  They compromised on it, because my mom loved Shakespeare, and I ended up called Theseus Cassio. Theseus for the slayer of the Minotaur, and Cassio for Othello’s doomed lieutenant. I think it sounds straight-up stupid. Theseus Cassio Lowood. Everyone just calls me Cas. I suppose I should be glad—my dad also loved Norse mythology, so I might have wound up being called Thor, which would have been basically unbearable.  
  
  I exhale and look in the mirror. There are no marks on my face, or on my gray dress button-up, just like there were no marks on the Rally Sport’s upholstery (thank god). I look ridiculous. I’m in slacks and sleeves like I’m out on a big date, because that’s what I told Mr. Dean I needed the car for. When I left the house tonight my hair was combed back, and there was a little bit of gel in it, but after that fucking kerfuffle it’s hanging across my forehead in dark streaks.  
  
  “Y  
ou should hurry up and get to bed, sweetheart. It’s late and we’ve got more packing to do.”  
  
  My mom is done with the knife. She’s floated back up against the doorjamb and her black cat is twisting around her ankles like a bored fish around a plastic castle.  
  
  “I just want to jump in the shower,” I say. She sighs and turns away.  
  
  “You did get him, didn’t you?” she says over her shoulder, almost like an afterthought.  
  
  “Yeah. I got him.”  
  
  She smiles at me. Her mouth looks sad and wistful. “It was close this time. You thought you’d have him finished before the end of July. Now it’s August.”  
  
  “He was a tougher hunt,” I say, pulling a towel down off the shelf. I don’t think she’s going to say anything else, but she stops and turns back.  
  
  “Would you have stayed here, if you hadn’t gotten him? Would you have pushed her back?”  
  
  I only think for a few seconds, just a natural pause in the conversation, because I knew the answer before she finished asking the question.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  As my mom leaves, I drop the bomb. “Hey, can I borrow some cash for a new set of tires?”  
  
  “Theseus Cassio,” she moans, and I grimace, but her exhausted sigh tells me that I’m good to go in the morning.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Thunder Bay, Ontario, is our destination. I’m going there to kill her. Anna. Anna Korlov. Anna Dressed in Blood.  
  
  “This one has you worried, doesn’t it, Cas,” my mom says from behind the wheel of the U-Haul van. I keep telling her we should just buy our own moving truck, instead of renting. God knows we move often enough, following the ghosts.  
  
  “Why would you say that?” I ask, and she nods at my hand. I hadn’t realized it was tapping against my leather bag, which is where Dad’s athame is. With a focused effort, I don’t take it away. I just keep tapping like it doesn’t matter, like she’s overanalyzing and reading into things.  
  
  “I killed Peter Carver when I was fourteen, Mom,” I say. “I’ve been doing it ever since. Nothing much surprises me anymore.

  There’s a tightening in her face. “You shouldn’t say it like that. You didn’t ‘kill’ Peter Carver. You were attacked by Peter Carver and he was already dead.”  
  
  It amazes me sometimes how she can change a thing just by using the right words. If her occult supply shop ever goes under, she’s got a good future in branding.  
  
  I was attacked by Peter Carver, she says. Yeah. I was attacked. But only after I broke into the Carver family’s abandoned house. It had been my first job. I did it without my mom’s permission, which is actually an understatement. I did it against my mom’s screaming protests and had to pick the lock on my bedroom window to get out of the house. But I did it. I took my father’s knife and broke in. I waited until two a.m. in the room where Peter Carver shot his wife with a .44 caliber pistol and then hung himself with his own belt in the closet. I waited in the same room where his ghost had murdered a real estate agent trying to sell the house two years later, and then a property surveyor a year after that.  
  
  Thinking about it now, I remember my shaking hands and a stomach close to heaving. I remember the desperation to do it, to do what I was supposed to do, like my father had. When the ghosts finally showed up (yes, ghosts plural—turns out that Peter and his wife had reconciled, found a common interest in killing) I think I almost passed out. One came out of the closet with his neck so purple and bent it looked like it was on sideways, and the other bled up through the floor like a paper towel commercial in reverse. She hardly made it out of the boards, I’m proud to say. Instinct took over and I tacked her back down before she could make a move. Carver tackled me though, while I was trying to pull my knife out of the wood that was coated with the stain that used to be his wife. He almost threw me out the window before I scrambled back to the athame, mewling like a kitten. Stabbing him was almost an accident. The knife just sort of ran into him when he wrapped the end of his rope around my throat and spun me around. I never told my mom that part.  
  
  “You know better than that, Mom,” I say. “It’s only other people who think you can’t kill what’s already dead.” I want to say that Dad knew too, but I don’t. She doesn’t like to talk about him, and I know that she hasn’t been the same since he died. She’s not quite here anymore; there’s something missing in all of her smiles, like a blurry spot or a camera lens out of focus. Part of her followed him, wherever it was that he went. I know it’s not that she doesn’t love me. But I don’t think she ever figured on raising a son by herself. Her family was supposed to form a circle. Now we walk around like a photograph that my dad’s been cut out of.  
  
  “I’ll be in and out like that,” I say, snapping my fingers and redirecting the subject. “I might not even spend the whole school year in Thunder Bay.”  
  
  She leans forward over the steering wheel and shakes her head. “You should think about staying longer. I’ve heard it’s a nice place.”  
  
  I roll my eyes. She knows better. Our life isn’t quiet. It isn’t like other lives, where there are roots and routines. We’re a traveling circus. And she can’t even blame it on my dad being killed, because we traveled with him too, though admittedly not as much. It’s the reason that she works the way she does, doing tarot card readings and aura cleansing over the phone, and selling occult supplies online. My mother the mobile witch. She makes a surprisingly good living at it. Even without my dad’s trust accounts, we’d probably be just fine.  
  
  Right now we’re driving north on some winding road that follows the shore of Lake Superior. I was glad to get out of North Carolina, away from iced tea and accents and hospitality that didn’t suit me. Being on the road I feel free, when I’m on my way from here to there, and it won’t be until I put my feet down on Thunder Bay pavement that I’ll feel like I’m back to work. For now I can enjoy the stacks of pines and the layers of sedimentary rock along the roadside, weeping groundwater like a constant regret. Lake Superior is bluer than blue and greener than green, and the clear light coming through the windows makes me squint behind my sunglasses.  
  
  “What are you going to do about college?”  
  
  “Mom,” I moan. Frustration bubbles out of me all of a sudden. She’s doing her half-and-half routine. Half accepting what I am, half insisting that I be a normal kid. I wonder if she did it to my dad too. I don’t think so.  
  
  “Cas,” she moans back. “Superheroes go to college too.”  
  
  “I’m not a superhero,” I say. It’s an awful tag. It’s egotistical, and it doesn’t fit. I don’t parade around in spandex. I don’t do what I do and receive accolades and keys to cities. I work in the dark, killing what should have stayed dead. If people knew what I was up to, they’d probably try to stop me. The idiots would take Casper’s side, and then I’d have to kill Casper and them after Casper bit their throats out. I’m no superhero. If anything I’m Rorschach from Watchmen. I’m Grendel. I’m the survivor in Silent Hill.  
  
  “If you’re so set on doing this during college, there are plenty of cities that could keep you busy for four years.” She turns the U-Haul into a gas station, the last one on the U.S. side. “What about Birmingham? That place is so haunted you could take two a month and still probably have enough to make it through grad school.”  
  
  “Yeah, but then I’d have to go to college in fucking Birmingham,” I say, and she shoots me a look. I mutter an apology. She might be the most liberal-minded of mothers, letting her teenage son roam the night hunting down the remains of murderers, but she still doesn’t like hearing the f-bomb fall out of my mouth.  
  
  She pulls up to the pumps and takes a deep breath. “You’ve avenged him five times over, you know.” Before I can say that I haven’t, she gets out and shuts the door.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  The scenery changed fast once we crossed over into Canada, and I’m looking out the window at miles of rolling hills covered in forest. My mother says it’s something called boreal forest. Recently, since we really started moving around, she’s developed this hobby of intensely researching each new place we live. She says it makes it feel more like a vacation, to know places where she wants to eat and things that she wants to do when we get there. I think it makes her feel like it’s more of a home.  
  
  She’s let Tybalt out of his pet carrier and he’s perched on her shoulder with his tail wrapped around her neck. He doesn’t spare a glance for me. He’s half Siamese and has that breed’s trait of choosing one person to adore and saying screw off to all the rest. Not that I care. I like it when he hisses and bats at me, and the only thing he’s good for is occasionally seeing ghosts before I do.  
  
  My mom is staring up at the clouds, humming something that isn’t a real song. She’s wearing the same smile as her cat.  
  
  “Why the good mood?” I ask. “Isn’t your butt asleep yet?”  
  
  “Been asleep for hours,” she replies. “But I think I’m going to like Thunder Bay. And from the looks of these clouds, I’m going to get to enjoy it for quite some time.”  
  
  I glance up. The clouds are enormous and perfectly white. They sit deadly still in the sky as we drive into them. I watch without blinking until my eyes dry out. They don’t move or change in any way.  
  
  “Driving into unmoving clouds,” she whispers. “Things are going to take longer than you expect.”  
  
  I want to tell her that she’s being superstitious, that clouds not moving don’t mean anything, and besides, if you watch them long enough they have to move—but that would make a hypocrite of me, this guy who lets her cleanse his knife in salt under moonlight.  
  
  The stagnant clouds make me motion-sick for some reason, so I go back to looking at the forest, a blanket of pines in colors of green, brown, and rust, struck through with birch trunks sticking up like bones. I’m usually in a better mood on these trips. The excitement of somewhere new, a new ghost to hunt, new things to see … the prospects usually keep my brain sunny for at least the duration of the drive. Maybe it’s just that I’m tired. I don’t sleep much, and when I do, there’s usually some kind of nightmare involved. But I’m not complaining.  
I’ve had them off and on since I started using the athame. Occupational hazard, I guess, my subconscious letting out all the fear I should be feeling when I walk into places where there are murderous ghosts. Still, I should try to get some rest. The dreams are particularly bad the night after a successful hunt, and they haven’t really calmed down since I took out the hitchhiker.  
  
  An hour or so later, after many attempts at sleep, Thunder Bay comes up in our windshield, a sprawling, urban-esque city of over a hundred thousand living. We drive through the commercial and business districts and I am unimpressed. Walmart is a convenient place for the breathing, but I have never seen a ghost comparing prices on motor oil or trying to jimmy his way into the Xbox 360 game case. It’s only as we get into the heart of the city—the older part of the city that rests above the harbor—that I see what I’m looking for.  
  
  Nestled in between refurbished family homes are houses cut out at bad angles, their coats of paint peeling in scabs and their shutters hanging crooked on their windows so they look like wounded eyes. I barely notice the nicer houses. I blink as we pass and they’re gone, boring and inconsequential.  
  
  Over the course of my life I’ve been to lots of places. Shadowed places where things have gone wrong. Sinister places where things still are. I always hate the sunlit towns, full of newly built developments with double-car garages in shades of pale eggshell, surrounded by green lawns and dotted with laughing children. Those towns aren’t any less haunted than the others. They’re just better liars. I like it more to come to a place like this, where the scent of death is carried to you on every seventh breath.  
  
  I watch the water of Superior lie beside the city like a sleeping dog. My dad always said that water makes the dead feel safe. Nothing draws them more. Or hides them better.  
  
  My mom has turned on the GPS, which she has affectionately named Fran after an uncle with a particularly good sense of direction. Fran’s droning voice is guiding us through the city, directing us like we’re idiots: Prepare to turn left in 100 feet. Prepare to turn left. Turn left. Tybalt, sensing the end of the journey, has returned to his pet carrier, and I reach down and shut the door. He hisses at me like he could have done it himself.  
  
  The house that we rented is smallish, two stories of fresh maroon paint and dark gray trim and shutters. It sits at the base of a hill, the start of a nice flat patch of land. When we pull up there are no neighbors peeking at us from windows or coming out onto their porches to say hello. The house looks contained, and solitary.  
  
  “What do you think?” my mom asks.  
  
  “I like it,” I reply honestly. “You can see things coming.”  
  
  She sighs at me. She’d be happier if I would grin and bound up the stairs of the front porch, throw open the door and race up to the second floor to try and call dibs on the master bedroom. I used to do that sort of thing when we’d move into a new place with Dad. But I was seven. I’m not going to let her road-weary eyes guilt me into anything. Before I know it, we’ll be making daisy chains in the backyard and crowning the cat the king of summer solstice.  
  
  Instead, I grab the pet carrier and get out of the U-Haul. It isn’t ten seconds before I hear my mom’s footsteps behind my own. I wait for her to unlock the front door, and then we go in, smelling cooped-up summer air and the old dirt of strangers. The door has opened on a large living room, already furnished with a cream-colored couch and wingback chair. There’s a brass lamp that needs a new lampshade, and a coffee and end table set in dark mahogany. Farther back, a wooden archway leads to the kitchen and an open dining room.  
  
  I look up into the shadows of the staircase on my right. Quietly, I close the front door behind us and set the pet carrier on the wood floor, then open it up. After a second, a pair of green eyes pokes out, followed by a black, slinky body. This is a trick I learned from my dad. Or rather, that my dad learned from himself.  
  
  He’d been following a tip into Portland. The job in question was the multiple victims of a fire in a canning factory. His mind was wound up with thoughts of machinery and things whose lips cracked open when they spoke. He hadn’t paid much attention when he rented the house we moved into, and of course the landlord didn’t mention that a woman and her unborn baby died there when her husband pushed her down the stairs. These are things one tends to gloss over.  
  
  It’s a funny thing about ghosts. They might have been normal, or relatively normal, when they were still breathing, but once they die they’re your typical obsessives. They become fixated on what happened to them and trap themselves in the worst moment. Nothing else exists in their world except the edge of that knife, the feel of those hands around their throat. They have a habit of showing you these things, usually by demonstration. If you know their story, it isn’t hard to predict what they’ll do.  
  
  On that particular day in Portland, my mom was helping me move my boxes up into my new room. It was back when we still used cheap cardboard, and it was raining; most of the box tops were softening like cereal in milk. I remember laughing over how wet we were getting, and how we left shoe-shaped puddles all over the linoleum entryway. By the sound of our scrambling feet you would have thought a family of hypoglycemic golden retrievers was moving in.  
  
  It happened on our third trip up the stairs. I was slapping my shoes down, making a mess, and had taken my baseball glove out of the box because I didn’t want it to get water-spotted. Then I felt it—something glide by me on the staircase, just brushing past my shoulder. There was nothing angry or hurried about the touch. I never told anyone, because of what happened next, but it felt motherly, like I was being carefully moved out of the way. At the time I think I thought it was my mom, making a play-grab for my arm, because I turned around with this big grin on my face, just in time to see the ghost of the woman change from wind to mist. She seemed to be wearing a sheet, and her hair was so pale that I could see her face through the back of her head. I’d seen ghosts before. Growing up with my dad, it was as routine as Thursday night meatloaf. But I’d never seen one shove my mother into thin air.  
  
  I tried to reach her, but all I ended up with was a torn scrap of the cardboard box. She fell back, the ghost wavering triumphantly. I could see Mom’s expression through the floating sheet. Strangely enough, I can remember that I could see her back molars as she fell, the upper back molars, and that she had two cavities in them. That’s what I think of when I think of that incident: the gross, queasy feeling I got from seeing my mother’s cavities. She landed on the stairs butt first and made a little “oh” sound, then rolled backward until she hit the wall. I don’t remember anything after that. I don’t even remember if we stayed in the house. Of course my father must have dispatched the ghost—probably that same day—but I don’t remember anything else of Portland. All I know is, after that my dad started using Tybalt, who was just a kitten then, and Mom still walks with a limp on the day before a thunderstorm.  
  
  Tybalt is eyeing the ceiling, sniffing the walls. His tail twitches occasionally. We follow him as he checks the entirety of the lower level. I get impatient with him in the bathroom, because he looks like he’s forgotten that he has a job to do and instead wants to roll on the cool tile. I snap my fingers. He squints at me resentfully, but he gets up and continues his inspection.  
  
  On the stairs he hesitates. I’m not worried. What I’m looking for is for him to hiss at thin air, or to sit quietly and stare at nothing. Hesitation doesn’t mean a thing. Cats can see ghosts, but they don’t have precognition. We follow him up the stairs and out of habit I take my mom’s hand. I’ve got my leather bag over my shoulder. The athame is a comforting presence inside, my own little St. Christopher’s medallion.  
  
  There are three bedrooms and a full bathroom on the fourth floor, plus a small attic with a pull-down ladder. It smells like fresh paint, which is good. Things that are new are good. No chance that some sentimental dead thing has attached itself. Tybalt winds his way through the bathroom and then walks into a bedroom. He stares at the dresser, its drawers open and askew, and regards the str  
ipped bed with distaste. Then he sits and cleans both forepaws.  
  
  “There’s nothing here. Let’s move our stuff in and seal it.” At the suggestion of activity, the lazy cat turns his head and growls at me, his green reflector eyes as round as wall clocks. I ignore him and reach up for the trap door to the attic. “Ow!” I look down. Tybalt has climbed me like a tree. I’ve got both hands on his back, and he has all four sets of claws snugly embedded in my skin. And the damned thing is purring.  
  
  “He’s just playing, honey,” my mom says, and carefully plucks each paw off of my clothing. “I’ll put him back in his carrier and stow him in a bedroom until we get the boxes in. Maybe you should dig in the trailer and find his litter box.”  
  
  “Great,” I say sarcastically. But I do get the cat set up in my mom’s new bedroom with food, water, and his cat box before we move the rest of our stuff into the house. It takes only two hours. We’re experts at this. Still, the sun is beginning to set when my mom finishes up the kitchen-witch business: boiling oils and herbs to anoint the doors and windows with, effectively keeping out anything that wasn’t in when we got here. I don’t know that it works, but I can’t really say that it doesn’t. We’ve always been safe in our homes. I do, however, know that it reeks like sandalwood and rosemary.  
  
  After the house is sealed, I start a small fire in the backyard, and my mom and I burn every small knickknack we find that could have meant something to a previous tenant: a purple beaded necklace left in a drawer, a few homemade potholders, and even a tiny book of matches that looked too well-preserved. We don’t need ghosts trying to come back for something left behind. My mom presses a wet thumb to my forehead. I can smell rosemary and sweet oil.  
 “Mom.”  
 “You know the rules. Every night for the first three nights.” She smiles, and in the firelight her auburn hair looks like embers. “It’ll keep you safe.

1mu88dg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mu88dg,Midnight gut check on kitchen design! Decision fatigue is so real.,"Hi all,
Looking for feedback on our kitchen design before we pull the trigger! We opted for no uppers along the window wall (so no more floating shelves between the windows) and will be opening the wall up between the two windows which will give us one 12.5 foot window. I think it will have a fresh and modern feel with limited uppers, but I’m not used to storing so much in lowers! For this reason, we’re putting in a “coffee bar” type built-in in the dining room that will feature two sorely needed pantries for dry foods. 

What I’m mostly unsure of:

1. Should I bother with floating shelves on either side of the over hood if they will only be 8” wide?

2. Should I reduce the window length to 10 feet and put a cabinet on top of the countertop to the left of the window? 

3. Do I even have enough space for a coffee bar if I want an 8-seater table and room to navigate behind the table/coffee bar and table/island on either side? Note: There is a patio door next to the dining table on the same wall as the kitchen windows. Note2: The distance between the end of the kitchen counter near the patio door and the edge of the coffee bar is only 8 1/4 feet. Another option is to maybe put a banquette with pantries on either side. 

4. How would you design the potlights? How far from the walls? Would 4 in an L-shape be enough, with 3 along the window wall?

5. Colour pallet: All painted maple cabinets (maybe Benjamin Moore Soft Chamois or Swiss Coffee) except the Island and the floating shelves either side of the oven hood and in the coffee bar which will be stained wood. 

6. Should the island be stained maple or red oak? Floors will be engineered hardwood, white oak or European oak.

But I blew into town with a storm gnawin’ at my heels, thunder barkin’ close enough to make windows rattle. First thought on my mind was food. Beth’s — a traveler’s first-and-last stop for a hundred miles any way you fly is the bastard cross between truck stop, diner, and motel.



Beth herself reminded me of Sal right off — a mother hen fattenin’ up strays, eyes sharp enough to know what kind of trouble you’re haulin’ but kind enough not to ask.



She fed me to the gills with pie. My God, that woman can bake — crust flakin’ like it owed her money, sugar sweet enough to wash the road dust from my bones.



Night rolled in with the storm. I holed up in one of the ramshackle huts they got the gall to call rooms. Roof leaked in two corners, wallpaper curlin’ like it was tryin’ to escape, but hell — the bed was clean, sheets smelled more of bleach than sweat, and no pests came crawlin’ out to greet me. That’s a win in my book.



Breakfast was cheap, coffee was free — tar black, bitter as old sin — but it kept the wheels turnin’.



Local crowd was about as colorful as you’d expect early on a Friday mornin’… least, I think it was a Friday. Days get slippery in Mayvale, slidin’ past like cards in a crooked shuffle. Folks nursed the coffee like medicine, eyes glued anywhere but each other, and I got the sense half of ‘em weren’t awake... and the other half wished they weren’t.



That’s when I crossed paths with Shamblin’ Joe. Old gator hunter by trade, though trade’s a kind word for it. Luck soured on him the day Big Bess clamped down and near took his leg clean off. Now he hobbles ‘round Mayvale like a bad omen with a grin too wide for his own good. Talks more to his flask than to folks, but I’ll be damned if he don’t know things he shouldn’t.



Joe laid three truths on me that morning, straight gospel and twice as heavy. Don’t go pokin’ at whatever’s stirrin’ over at the high school. Cross the rainbow if I had a death wish. And last -maybe worst of all - you can’t always save Bishop. He didn’t explain, just let it hang in the smoke between us, like I oughta already know.



Well, I know now, don’t I? Ain’t no clearer way to put it - school’s crawlin’ with heart-eatin’ Aztecs wearin’ letterman jackets like it’s the most natural thing in the world. And as for rainbows - hell, if I never lay eyes on one again, it’ll still be too soon.



But those came later - after the wheels came off and Mayvale showed its real teeth.

So how much coffee should I use if I want a 1:15 ratio?
24 g? Then 360mL water total? 48 mL water stays in the grounds yielding 312 mL (~10.6oz) coffee. Sound right?
20g coffee then 300 mL water will only yield 260 mL coffee=8.8 oz-a rather small cup. If I pour 330 mL then I should get 290 mL coffee (just under 10 oz) but that’s a 16.5 ratio. 
Anyone else take this into consideration?

I am going to challenge myself to cold approach 100 women by the end of the year. I don't approach women because I always assumed that they would not be into me but I don't have any evidence to back that up because I have not actually tried it. My goal is to get a date but I don't have high expectations for this. This is the video where I got the idea from: [https://youtu.be/O0m2XGCkJD8?si=B1RKLRntebo4n2eG](https://youtu.be/O0m2XGCkJD8?si=B1RKLRntebo4n2eG) but obviously I'm not as good looking as that guy so it will probably be more difficult for me. I would consider myself below average. I've heard that cold approaching has a 10-15% success rate.

Before the spring semester ended I tried asking out some girls in my circles to test the waters and this is how it went:

Girl #1 - Bridesmaid. I tried talking to her after the wedding rehearsal to compliment her denim jacket with cool patches. I'm not sure if I interrupted her conversation or something but she looked at me like I was being weird and replied to me very coldly. At the reception I asked her to dance and she just said ""I'm not good at dancing"" and I left her alone after that; then I saw her dancing with someone else. 

Girl #2 - I met this girl on campus because she was advertising for her org/club. I would always say hi and talk to her a little bit every time I saw her. I managed to figure out she was Southern Baptist and I told her I was Catholic. Finally towards the end of the semester I decided to ask her out on a date. I told her I thought she was very beautiful and that I would love to take her out on a date. She turned me down nicely.

Girl #3 - This girl would hang out at the library pretty frequently and I thought she was really cute. I'm not going to lie this was one of the worst approaches I have ever made. I went up and shook her hand, introduced myself and then didn't really know what to say so I ended the conversation by saying something like ""see you around"" and left. Then I realized I didn't even ask for her number. Also she looked super confused as to why some random guy was talking to her.  
  
Girl #4 - I saw this young girl at the student center and she looked kinda nerdy so I thought she would be easy to approach. I had seen her once or twice before at the student center. She did look suspiciously young; my college has a special program that allows high school students to attend classes to gain college credit early. It's not uncommon to see highschoolers in the student center. So I went up to her said hi and the first thing I asked her was ""are you 18?"" which was a really strange question. Anyway the conversation was kind of awkward and I finally asked for her number and she said she was Aero/Ace I had never actually heard anyone say that out loud so I was confused for a second before it clicked. She said ""don't take it too hard"" and seemed very empathetic. Or she was giving me pity idk it was strange.

Girl #5 - I had been on a group project with this girl and I really enjoyed her eccentric/weird energy. I cringe just thinking about what went down. I asked her after class for her number and my phone was dead so she gave me her number on a sticky note. Anyway this is how I realized that I was really bad at texting. I can't even remember what I texted her but she never replied so I sent some stupid joke because I thought she had just ghosted me. Looking back on it I came off as desperate and she didn't owe me a reply so there was no need to text her again. Anyway she said she didn't want to text me because she wanted to focus on the upcoming test. I said something like ""oh ok thats very thoughtful"" and she never replied. Honestly I fumbled this by being stupid and impatient.

Girl #6 - I asked some girl I knew but hadn't seen in a while for a coffee date over instagram and she said yes when she comes back to town but then never replied. In her defense she has been traveling a lot this summer. Also I think she's 30. I have no idea how I missed that.

Girl #7 - I met a girl at a run club. The club wasn't officially Catholic but it was started by and mostly attended by people from the local parish. The girl was pretty fast and I thought she was cute. We ran alongside each other in silence for a while before she overtook me. I asked for her number and she actually gave it to me. Anyway I asked her on a coffee date but she said she had to pack to go home for the summer. She took a day to reply every time I texted her so I decided to just call it quits; she clearly wasn't interested and was just texting me to be nice. I actually felt kind of offended because why would she give me her number if she wasn't interested but she doesn't owe me a reply or anything for that matter. Just because someone texts me doesn't mean they want to spend time with me. I just need to let it go.

  
I would say I've had overall positive results even if I didn't get any dates. I try to stick to my ""league"" as much as possible but honestly I think the concept of leagues is kinda silly. I'm definitely not going after models but these girls were pretty; at least to me. I got numbers 2/7 times which gives me a success rate of 28% Very cool I guess. I appreciate any feedback and I guess stick around if you want to see the results of this social experiment. I will continue posting updates to my profile and to r/CatholicDating if the mods allow it. They tend to crack down hard on anything that remotely resembles blackpill content (especially when posted by men) so I will try to keep things lighthearted and wholesome.",1,1755576240.0,u_proverbs27-17,0,1.0,False

I’m Tilly 💕I just moved to Boston about two weeks ago and I’m still finding my way around. So far I love the city, it feels so much more open and safe than where I came from.

A little about me: I’m a 21 y/o trans woman (currently presenting masc most of the time because of safety stuff back home, but I really want to start going out dressed femme again). I’m originally from a pretty traditional family/country where being myself wasn’t really understood, so being here feels like a fresh start.

I don’t know anyone here yet, and it’s been a little lonely, so I’d love to connect with other queer/trans folks in the area. Whether it’s grabbing coffee, exploring the city, going out dressed cute together, or just hanging out, I really want to find community and spaces where I can flourish as my femme self.

I’m also a POC, so sometimes I feel a little awkward trying to blend into the wider queer community, but I’m hoping Boston has people who will get me and vibe with me.

If anyone’s down to meet up, share community resources, or just chat, please reach out—I’d love to hear from you!",1,1755576229.0,boston,0,0.6,False

  \-Clay-  
  
  “You're cheating! There is no freaking way you can win six rounds of poker!” The scrawny boy across the table from me said, throwing his cards down in frustration. I chuckled, as I scooped up the pile of red and blue chips, adding them to my pile.  
  
  “I warned you that there was no way you could beat me, Tyler. Not my fault that you didn't take my advice.” Tyler grumbled under his breath but grabbed the pile of cards and started to shuffle them again.  
  
  I leaned back in the wing back chair waiting for my friend to deal. I had been at the Grayson Center for almost three months. I was enrolled in a 90 day program and my time was almost up. Looking around the recreation room, I would actually be kind of sad when I had to leave.  
  
  Which is weird considering how much I had fought coming here in the first place. Once I had gotten over my anger and oppositional reaction to treatment, I sort of came to enjoy my time there and found that the staff and the other patients did something I never thought possible.  
  
  They showed me how to heal.  
  
  And that's what I was doing. Slowly. Not that I expected a perfect fix in three months. I realized my healing would take years. And there were days I never thought I would be able to leave and live a decent life outside the support of the center and the safety of its walls. But then there were good days, like today, when I felt like I could take on the world.  
  
  Like I could find my way back to Maggie.  
  
  “What's with the goofy smile, bro? You look like an idiot,” Tyler said good-naturedly as he tossed out cards. I blinked, taken away from my happy thoughts and picked up my cards.  
  
  “Nothin' man. Just having a good day.”  
  
  Tyler smiled. Other guys would probably have given me shit for acting like an emo pussy. But not the people here. We were all there because we needed to have those good days. So we understood the importance of being happy for those who had them.  
  
  “Cool, Clay. Glad to hear it. Now, focus on the damn game. I want to win some of my chips back.” Tyler retorted, concentrating on his hand.  
  
  I grinned before beating him soundly yet again.  
  
  \*\*\*  
  
  The group sat on the floor, kids relaxing on oversized cushions. Looking around, I could almost imagine this was just a bunch of friends hanging out together. Except for the two adults who sat in the middle asking them questions like, “Tell me about your relationship with your family” and “How does that make you feel?”  
  
  Yep, group therapy was a blast.  
  
  The girl to my right, a dark haired- chick, named Maria who was here to deal with her severe depression and promiscuity brought on by serious daddy issues, was trying to figure out how to answer the question that Lydia, the female counselor, had just asked her.  
  
  “Just think about your happiest memory with your mother. It can be something simple like talking to her about your day, or a time she smiled at you,” Lydia prompted gently. Maria's problems, like most of the kids in the room, were rooted firmly in the relationship with her parents.  
  
  Today's group topic was trying to acknowledge the positive aspects of our familial relationships. To say this was hard for most of us was an understatement.  
  
  I dreaded the groups when we had to talk about our parents in a more positive way. It was so much easier to vent about how crappy they were than actually devoting energy in searching for something nice to say.  
  
  “Um. Well, I guess there was a time, I was probably like six. And my mom took me to the park and pushed me on the swings,” Maria volunteered, looking at Lydia and Matt, the other counselor, for approval.  
  
  They each nodded. “Good. And how did you feel then?” Matt urged.  
  
  Maria smiled a bit. “It felt good. Like she...I don't know...loved me.” The smile on her face was sad and my heart hurt for her. I understood her need to feel loved by her mother all too well.  
  
  There was some more processing and then a period of silence while everyone allowed Maria time to get herself together. Then it was my turn. Matt looked at me expectantly. “Clay. What about you? What is a happy memory you have about your parents?” The group looked at me, waiting for my answer. Over the last two and a half months, this disclosure thing had proven difficult for me.  
  
  I was not a person that revealed personal details very easily. It had taken Maggie, the person I loved most in this world, a long time to get me to open up. And if it was hard for me to talk to Maggie, then it was like pulling teeth to get me to open up to a group of strangers.  
  
  But over time, after lots of individual and group therapy sessions, I found myself able to loosen up and talk more about what I had experienced. The things I felt, my fears, my pain, and what I wanted most in my life. And I found that the more I talked, the better I felt  
.  
  
  I began to recognize that these people weren't here to judge me or make me feel bad when I talked about wanting to kill myself or how hard it was for me not to cut. They didn't look at me like I was crazy when I would break down after a particularly gut-wrenching session. This was the most support I had felt from anyone, other than Maggie, and Ruby and Lisa, in my entire life.  
  
  And it felt unbelievable.  
  
  So, with all eyes on me, I thought really hard about my answer to Matt's question. And then, just like that I had it. A memory that was actually good and not tainted by anger and bitterness. “My dad taking me fishing.” Lydia smiled at me. “Yeah. It was before things got really bad. My dad wasn't the district attorney yet, so he had more time for me. He picked me up from school early one day and drove us out to a lake. I can't really remember where. Anyway, we spent all day fishing and talking. It was nice.”  
  
  I found myself smiling as I remembered a time I could be with my dad without wanting to rip his face off. Matt nodded. “That sounds awesome, Clay. Thanks for sharing that with us.” And he was moving on to the next person.  
  
  The memory of that time with my dad made me feel pretty good. I was feeling that way a lot more lately. Less of the crazy depression and anger, and more of the happy-go-lucky thing that I never thought I was capable of experiencing.  
  
  I'm sure it had a lot to do with my new medication. After I came to the Grayson Center, my new doctor, Doctor Todd as we kids called him, put me on a new pill. One that helped control my mood swings without turning me into a zombie.  
  
  It was pretty great. And even though I had moments where I strangely missed those energetic highs, which Doctor Todd told me was normal, I sure as hell didn't miss the crippling lows. The psychotherapy that I attended three times a week was also helping a lot. It was nice to not have to worry about hurting myself or someone else. To think that maybe I would be able to get my shit together and find a way back to where I belonged.  
  
  With Maggie.  
  
  I shook my head. I couldn't think about her here in group. That was something I saved for when I was alone. Because if I started thinking of her now, I would invariably start thinking about how much I hurt her and how I fucked things up so royally. And then my feel- good mood would evaporate in a flash. Snap. Just like that.  
  
  I must have zoned out for a while, because I suddenly realized that the other kids were getting to their feet. Maria grinned at me. “Earth to Clay!” She reached for my hand to help me up. I looked at her a moment as I got to my feet. Maria had a nice smile and really pretty eyes. But she wasn't Maggie. I dropped her hand quickly. I tried to pretend that I didn't see the disappointment flash across her face. We walked together out of the common room and headed down the hallway to the cafeteria. “That was pretty tough today,” Maria said as we joined up with the others, who were getting in line for lunch.  
  
  I nodded. “Yeah. It's kinda hard finding something nice to say about my parents. You know, considering they're a bunch of self-absorbed asses,” I joked, picking up a tray. Maria giggled behind me.  
  
  “I know what you mean. My mom is a cracked out dead beat who refused to protect me from my dad because it got in the way of her next high. Thinking of the ooey gooey times together is more than a little difficult.”  
  
  I took a plate of pasta and a salad and moved to drinks, getting myself a bottle of water. Maria followed me to our regular table near the large window overlooking the gardens. Tyler and our other friends, Susan and Greg, were already seated.  
  
  “Hey guys,” I said as I sat down. Greg scooted over to make room and Maria sat on my other side.  
  
  “How was group?” Tyler asked around a mouthful of sandwich. Maria and I shrugged in unison and we laughed.  
  
  “It was group. How about you guys?” Maria commented. The other three were in a group for substance abuse the same time Maria and I were in ours. Susan Biddle, a short girl with brown hair and big brown eyes who reminded me a lot of Maggie's friend Rachel, snorted.  
  
  “It would have been better if loud mouth Austin hadn't decided to be a total dick to Jean.” Jean was the substance abuse counselor at the center. And Austin was this places' Paul Delawder, the dick who had destroyed my MP3 player my first day at Jackson High School back in Virginia.  
  
  The guy Maggie had jumped to defend me from. I smiled at the memory of my brave girl.  
  
  Maria elbowed me in the side to bring me back to the conversation. “Fuck, Austin. He sucks,” I said smiling. Greg, Susan, and Tyler agreed and the conversation then focused on the movie the center was showing tonight.  
  
  Every week, if we had earned enough merits and were doing well in our therapy, we earned a movie night. We earned merits for completing various chores that the behavioral aides and therapists assigned us. This week my job was to keep the common room clean. I shared the job with three other kids. I had earned all of my merits for the week, which was pretty cool. I had lost a lot of them my first two weeks here. So getting to join in the fun stuff was about as excited as I got anymore.  
  
  It wasn't like we left the facility or anything. But it was nice to hang out with everyone in a non-therapeutic way and watch a movie without having to talk about our feelings. Everyone could just relax and remember for a little while, that yeah, we were still teenagers.  
  
  Maria, Tyler (who was my roommate), and I walked back to my room after lunch. We had an hour until afternoon sessions started. I had a one on one with the substance abuse counselor, Jean. The others had sessions either with their counselors or in groups. That was the thing about this place. It was one big session after another with a tiny bit of school squeezed into the mix. We had two hours in the morning for school work provided by the Miami School District and then the rest of the day was all about dealing with our issues.  
  
  Maria went and flopped on my bed, making herself at home. I had gotten pretty close to Maria since I got here (in a purely platonic way of course) and she often came back to the room to hang with Tyler and me. But it still felt weird to have her on my bed, even if she was just sitting on it. Because I didn't want to see any girl but Maggie May Young on my bed.  
  
  Even though I had written Maggie a letter a month ago, telling her to move on, it didn't mean that I had moved on. I couldn't stomach the thought of being with anyone but her. No one else mattered. I had a feeling that Maria was starting to like me as more than a friend. And even though I hadn't done anything to encourage it, I felt like I was going to have to say something to her soon.  
  
  No way was I going to hurt another girl I cared about.  
  
  Tyler got on his computer and started typing out emails. I pulled up my desk chair and straddled it backwards, leaning my arms on the back. Maria leaned over and picked up the framed picture on my bedside table.  
  
  “She's really pretty,” Maria commented with a twinge of something in her voice that I wasn't able to identify. Maria had picked up the only picture I had in the room. It was a picture of Maggie and me from the Fall Formal. We were sitting beside each other at Red Lobster and we both made faces at the camera. I didn't need to look at the picture to remember how things used to be between us. It was all I could think about. Every second of every day. All I did was think. About the good times. And the bad times. And all the messed up stuff in between.  
  
  Maria gave a small sigh and placed the frame back in its spot. “Do you ever talk to her?” she asked me. I always felt strange talking about Maggie. Even though things had gotten ugly between us, my love for her was the one pure thing in my life. I wanted to keep it all to myself and not share it with anyone. She was the last thing I thought about before I went to sleep and the first thing my mind went to when I woke up.  
  
  I constantly wondered what she was doing, if she was happy, if she had started dating anyone. That thought hurt. A lot. Because I really did want her to live her life, even if that meant moving on from me. But that didn't mean I had to like it. “No. I don't think that would do either of us any good,” I admitted, repositioning the picture frame so that I could see it.  
  
  Maria  
frowned. “Why? If you love her so much, don't you think talking to her would be a good thing?” I gritted my teeth. Explaining anything regarding my relationship with Maggie made me defensive. But I forced myself to calm down; using those breathing techniques the counselors had been drilling into our brains for months.  
  
  “Because Maria, the fact that I love her is the reason I can't go turning her life upside down anymore. I won't fuck with her like that again. She's been through enough because of me.” I sounded so pathetic. Maggie's hold on me was as unyielding as ever.  
  
  Maria's face softened, her eyes getting that dewy look that girls get when a guy says something sweet (Maggie used to get that same look every time I told her I loved her). “She's lucky to have your love, Clay. I hope she realizes that.”  
  
  I swallowed, getting a little uncomfortable talking about this with Maria, particularly with Tyler five feet away. Maria reached out and squeezed my arm, her fingers, I noticed, lingering on my skin. “Just keep doing what you're doing and maybe one day you'll feel like you can call her.”  
  
 I smiled. Yeah. Maybe...one day.  
  
  Chapter Two  
  
  \-Maggie-  
  
  This job was going to kill me. I wrapped a wet paper towel around the scald on my wrist and winced. Hot coffee and Maggie May Young clearly didn't mix.  
  
  Let me rephrase. Hot coffee being carried on a precariously balanced tray and Maggie May Young were bad news. I removed the towel and glared at the huge red splotch on my skin. That would definitely blister.  
  
  “What the heck did you do?” a voice asked from behind me. I rolled my eyes at Jake Fitzsimmons, who put down the pastries he was loading into the display case and came over to check out my war wound.  
  
  “I was on the wrong end of a Mocha Latte,” I deadpanned, pulling my sleeve down to cover my angry skin. I gave my co-worker and friend a painful grimace. Jake frowned with concern and held out his hand.  
  
  “Let me see, Maggie,” he told me firmly. I rolled my eyes again but held my arm out for him to inspect. I looked around the bustling café and knew I needed to get back to work. The place was slammed.  
  
  I had been working at Java Madness for two weeks. I had just been taken off of probation three days ago and here I was, nursing a nasty burn and ready to throw my apron on the floor and stomp out. For some reason, I was really struggling with coffee making and waiting tables. You wouldn't think it would be akin to brain surgery, but I had dropped more trays, broken more mugs and gotten more orders wrong in the last two weeks than seemed acceptable.  
  
  The manager, Jacob, looked ready to can me last night when I had a table complain about how I screwed up their sandwich order, not once, but twice. I was trying. Honestly. But as with everything in my life anymore...it was just a struggle. Nothing was easy and normal anymore and it was difficult putting all the pieces together into a picture that made sense.  
  
  Jake Fitzsimmons had been working at Java Madness for a year and was trying to help me keep my job. I gave him a wan smile as he ran his fingers over the burn lightly. I tried not to rip my hand away from him, not liking him touching me in any way. But it wasn't like he was trying to cop a feel. He was just being concerned.  
  
  After a few more seconds, I couldn't help it; I wriggled my arm from his grasp. “I'll live,” I muttered, turning back to the espresso machine that had already maimed me once. I glared at the shiny, silver contraption. “Play nice,” I directed its way under my breath.  
  
  Jake laughed as I started to fiddle with the nobs. He reached from behind me and put two mugs under the spigots and turned it on. “Thanks,” I said; giving him what I hoped was a sincere smile. I would seriously be lost in this place if he didn't continuously rescue me from coffee related mishaps.  
  
  “You'll get it...eventually,” he teased, turning back to the display case. I waited for the drinks and leaned against the counter. Jake looked up at me, his eyes sparkling in that flirty way of his and I had to look away. Jake was cute and at one time, I had found his boy next-door good looks to be attractive. With his short red hair and pretty blue eyes, what wasn’t there to like? But that was before I had been ruined for any guy that wasn't the dark headed, tortured lone wolf type.  
  
  Jake's smile immediately made me feel uncomfortable. Jake and I had an easy banter. Always had. Even if he had never been exactly subtle in the fact that he wanted more than friendship. But he hadn't pushed it since...well...since the incident.  
  
  God, I couldn't even think about it properly in the privacy of my own thoughts. I couldn't think about him at all, not while I was out in public. Otherwise, I ran the risk of turning into a huge blubbering mess. And I had vowed to myself six weeks ago when I had gotten the letter, that I wouldn't become that person...ever again.  
  
  But I still felt strange being around people. Like they were all looking at me and talking about me and feeling...gah...SYMPATHY for me. And I hated that. Because I didn't need or deserve their sympathy. But I was the girl who had run off with her mentally unstable boyfriend, only to be brought back to town after his suicide attempt and being subsequently institutionalized. Nothing was a secret in Davidson, so of course everyone knew the sordid details.  
  
  And boys...well they were out of the question. Dating, kissing, maybe loving anyone else was so not on my radar. Not when every night when I fell asleep I did so with the picture of his face ever present in my mind.  
  
  And Jake. Sweet, good hearted Jake. We were just friends. Would only ever be friends. But I saw the way he looked at me. I wasn't an idiot. I was just refusing to acknowledge it. Denial seemed to work for me, so I stuck with it.  
  
  I put the small, circular tray on the counter and loaded it up with drinks. “Maybe you should come back and get the rest,” Jake suggested, indicating my full tray. His raised eyebrows made me laugh. And that felt good. I laughed so rarely any more that I almost forgot what it felt like when it did happen.  
  
  “I think you may be right,” I conceded, taking a few of the drinks off and going around the counter to take them to my table. I delivered everything and did a little jig when I got back to my station by the espresso machine. Jake came up and gave me a high five, grinning at me.  
  
  “You did it! That's four tables in a row without dropping anything! That has to be a record,” Jake joked, squeezing my shoulder. I tried not to shrug off his hand and forced a smile.  
  
  “I have employee of the month written all over me,” I quipped and Jake just shook his head before going to tend to his own tables.  
  
  I looked up at the sound of the bell on the door, signaling another customer. “Hey guys!” I called out as Rachel and Daniel came in. It was still strange seeing them together, holding hands. They looked up at me and in unison, dropped their clasped hands. I frowned. They did that a lot. Made a point not to touch or act like the couple that they were. I worried that they were doing that because of me. Which was ridiculous. I had told them time and time again, I was over the moon with how happy they were together.  
  
  Or maybe they were taking pity on my pathetic loveless existence.  
  
  Daniel gave me a smirk. “What's the total?” he asked without preamble. I shot him a look of pure death. He laughed as Rachel elbowed him in the gut, making him grunt.  
  
  “Shut it, Danny,” she growled and I smiled at her. Rachel had really grown into herself over the past six months. Long gone was the girl who was scared to speak her mind and stand up for herself. And I was the first person to be glad to see that particular girl take a hike.  
  
  I liked this Rachel a hell of a lot better.  
  
  Jake came up beside me and leaned across the counter to fist bump Daniel and then to give Rachel a hug. He slung an arm around my shoulders. “Zero today, man. Our girl is on a roll,” Jake said over a chuckle.  
  
  My stomach clenched and I instantly tensed up. Our girl? Uh, I don't think so.  
  
  I looked at Rachel, who was staring rather pointedly at the arm Jake had so carelessly flung around me. And it was obvious she was picking up on my discomfort with Jake's over the top familiarity. We were just friends. Then why did it seem as though I was committing a betrayal by even allowing him to touch me?  
  
  Oh that's right, because I still hung onto the hope that my broken knight would gallop back into my life and sweep me off of my feet.  
  
  I never claimed to not be delusional.  
  
  I wiggled out from under Jake's arm and he backed away a bit. He gave me a smile that barely concealed his disappointment. Well, he'd have to live with a lot of disappointment because I AM NOT going there with him, I thought harshly.  
  
  Daniel let out a whoop, pulling my attention back to my best friends. “Nothing broken in two hours? That's damn near amazing, Mags!” He ruffled my hair in that annoying way of his and I swatted him away.  
  
  “Enough about my less than stellar waitressing abilities and give me your damn order,” I bit out, trying not to be irritated by his friendly ribbing. Rachel elbowed her boyfriend again and he grabbed her hand and pulled it to his mouth, kissing it softly.  
  
  They stared into the others’ eyes and I wistfully watched the way their bodies instinctively move  
d toward one other. Then as if realizing what they were doing, they simultaneously looked my way and backed away from each other.  
  
  And that made me feel like shit. I didn't want them to hide how crazy in love they were just because they felt sorry for me. Even if watching their obvious happiness was like a knife in my heart. A sharp reminder of my own loneliness and misery.  
  
  I plastered a smile on my face. “The usual?” I asked, looking between them. They both nodded. “Head over to a table and I'll bring your order in a minute,” I said, pushing away the money Danny tried to put in my hand. “It's on me,” I told him.  
  
  “Thanks, Maggie,” Rachel said appreciatively and blew me a kiss as she headed toward a table by the window. Daniel grabbed a handful of napkins.  
  
  “Don't drop anything!” he joked and I threw a coffee stirrer at him. Jake made Rachel's tomato and cheese panini and I loaded up a plate with brownies and cookies for Daniel. For a guy in such great shape, he really did eat like a five year old with a sugar addiction.  
  
  “Are you going to Ray's thing tonight?” Jake asked me out of left field. I darted him a look out of the corner of my eye as I grabbed a macaroon. Peering down at the plate, I figured I may just put Danny in a sugar coma with this junk.  
  
  “Uh, I wasn't aware there was a thing at Ray's,” I answered noncommittally. It's not that I wasn't invited; I just knew that a lot of people stopped bothering to extend their offers of parties and get togethers anymore. As much as I was trying to have some sort of normal life, it was slow coming. Rachel and Daniel were the only ones I spent any sort of time with. Massive social gatherings felt like a panic attack waiting to happen.  
  
  I had never before been this kooky social phobic shut in that I had become. But after everything I had been through this past school year and knowing that I was still the subject of so much speculation and gossip, I had no desire to mingle.  
  
  Jake let out an exasperated snort and I looked up at him in surprise. “What?” I asked defensively. Jake narrowed his eyes and looked as though he wanted to shake me.  
  
  “When will you stop hiding away like a hermit? Your life isn't over as much as you act like it is,” he said with irritation. My eyes widened a bit in shock. And then they narrowed into angry slits. What business was it of Jake Fucking Fitzsimmons if I go out or not? I did not appreciate his insinuation or attitude.  
  
  “I don't act like my life is over! Pardon me if I have more to do with my time than to hang out with a bunch of lame ass drunks who find beer pong to be the height of sophistication,” I hissed, grabbing the plate with Rachel's panini from Jake's hands, sending potato chips careening to floor.  
  
  I let out a growl of frustration and bent down to pick up the mess. I wanted to scream at Jake that he needed to back off. But I also wanted to scream at myself. Because maybe he was right. I had been in my designated hidey hole for months now. I did act as though my life were over.  
  
  But wasn't it?  
  
  Hadn't I pinned all my hopes and dreams on a boy who ultimately ripped them up and threw them away? I had been a stupid, naive girl. But I missed that girl too. Because the one who had been left behind was bitter and heart broken.  
  
  Jake knelt beside me and sighed. “I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm just sick of seeing you mope around over that guy. He's gone. He's not coming back. Don't you think it's time to start doing something more than what you're doing?” he asked me delicately, obviously not sure how I would respond to his words.  
  
  Because we never talked about Clayton Reed. In fact, most people made it a point to avoid the topic altogether. Well, at least to my face. I knew his name was whispered behind my back - a lot.  
  
  But Jake was just being a friend. And I was in short supply of those lately. And maybe he was right...I needed to let my friends off of my emotional suicide watch. And then I felt angry again. This time at Clay. For reducing me to this. For letting me go. For abandoning me when I had never, not once, abandoned him.  
  
  And it was that that made me get to my feet and straighten my spine. “You're right, Jake. I'll go tonight,” I said with a determination that I had been missing for a while now.  
  
  Jake grinned and pulled me into a hug. I tried not to push him away. But he seemed to be doing the touching thing a lot lately. I should probably put him in his place. Remind him that I was not interested in him like that. But it felt nice to be held. However briefly. So I let him. For a few seconds at least. Then I felt the weirdness and pulled away.  
  
  Feeling a little bit better, I took Rachel and Daniel their food and drinks. Daniel didn't waste a moment before attacking the plate of diabetes I gave him. Rachel bit into her sandwich and looked at me with her all seeing eyes.  
  
  “Well, things are looking awfully friendly in here,” she remarked and I wanted to snap at her to drop it. Rachel and Daniel had mentioned, on more than one occasion mind you, that Jake was interested in me. You'd have to be blind not to know that. They never pushed it, knowing I haven't been ready. But I knew they held onto the silent hope that I would snap out of my Clay funk and give Daniel's friend a chance. Rachel had serious double dating fantasies (something she probably wouldn't have convinced Daniel to participate in if it were Clay I was with). I was really sick of dodging this bullet. But for once I didn't smack down her verbal query. I just shrugged my shoulders and sat back in the chair, watching in disgusted awe as Daniel finished off the last of his food.  
  
  I saw the considerable effort it took for Rachel to suppress her obvious glee. She knew my lack of a hateful response was in its own way a small victory. And I let her have it. For now.  
  
  “I don't know whether to be completely impressed or ready to throw up,” I whispered dramatically, as I put Daniel's now empty plate on the tray. Rachel shook her head and shot Danny a loving smile. The softness of her expression reminded me so much of the way I used to look at...  
  
  I jumped to my feet. There had been enough reminiscing for one day. “So, I think I'm going to head over to Ray's this evening,” I announced louder than I meant to. Daniel and Rachel stopped making goo-goo eyes at each other and looked at me in surprise. Well, surprise was an understatement. They were staring at me as though I suggested hitchhiking to California. And that just reinforced how out of touch I had become with my own life.  
  
  “You are? Really?” Rachel squeaked and I set my mouth in a grim line.  
  
  “That's awesome. You need a ride?” Daniel asked, grinning at me. I shook my head.  
  
  “Nah. I'll drive myself. That way if you want to leave early, or stay later than me, it won't be a problem. What time should I head over?” I asked, ignoring the giddy expressions on my friends' faces.  
  
  “Uh, eight? But what made you decide to come?” Rachel asked me.  
  
  “I convinced her to grace us with her presence for the evening,” Jake piped in, appearing by my side and taking the tray from my hands. I clenched my hands into fists and willed myself not to say something hateful. He really was all up in my business today.  
  
  Rachel's eyes flashed at me and I could see the wheels turning. I glared at her in warning. She wisely stayed quiet. “Well, thanks for the intervention. She needs to do more than work and go to the grocery store. She currently has the social life of a nursing home resident and even they play Bingo,” Daniel said.  
  
  I threw my hands up in frustration. “You guys act like I've been sitting in a darkened room every night. Give it a rest, will you,” I snapped. Rachel seemed contrite, while Daniel, damn him, just laughed at my ire.  
  
  “Not far from the mark there, Mags,” he mused and I shut up. Because he was right.  
  
  “Okay, well, I'll see you later,” I said, giving up on the conversation. I left Jake to continue talking with Rachel and Daniel and headed back toward the counter. There was a line and Jennifer, the other girl working, looked flustered.  
  
  I hurried to help her and got lost in the chaos for a while. I found that being busy really helped keep my mind free and clear of the dark thoughts that I tended to gravitate towards. And I realized I was looking forward to going out tonight. Be  
ing around friends. I was finally ready to take a step in the right direction and get things back on track.  
  
  “Maggie.” I looked up at the voice and froze. And just like that I wanted to run in the back and hide. Not because I didn't want to see the person that said my name, but because those dark thoughts that I had kept at bay all afternoon, came rushing back.  
  
  “Hi, Lisa. How are you?” I asked, trying to sound happy to see her. And on some level I was. I really liked Lisa. She and Ruby, Clay's aunt, were two of the most loving people I had ever met. And I would always appreciate the way she had supported me during one of the bleakest times of my life.  
  
  But seeing her made me invariably think of him. And given the yo-yo of emotions that unfurled inside me, I knew that wasn’t a particularly good thing.  
  
  Lisa's mouth raised in a hesitant smile. As though she wasn't entirely sure of the reception I'd give her. I hadn't seen Lisa or Ruby since right after the incident. In a small town like Davidson, it was actually surprising that we hadn't crossed paths. But we hadn't. Until now. Until I was finally feeling ready to move on with my life and get it together. It was like fate or something.

1mu860r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1mu860r/my_candida_routine_fatigue_bloating_getting_better/,My Candida routine (fatigue + bloating getting better),"Hey guys, just wanted to share my current routine for candida since I’ve been seeing some improvements. Fatigue was my main symptom (along with bloating), and both are starting to get better.

Meds:
	•	Nystatin – 500,000 units, 3x a day

Supplements:
	•	Vitamin D3 – morning with iron
	•	Iron – morning
	•	Vitamin B12 – later in the day, away from iron
	•	NAC – just added this in

Drinks/other stuff:
	•	Matcha with coconut milk + monk fruit/erythritol (my treat instead of coffee/sugar)

Diet basics:
	•	No gluten, no dairy, no sugar
	•	Mostly protein, veggies, and coconut-based things

So far, fatigue is lifting a bit and my bloating has been less intense, which feels like progress. Curious if anyone else noticed NAC making a difference? And still wondering if monk fruit + erythritol is a safe bet long term for candida.

1mu7ya6,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1mu7ya6/some_positive_relief/,Some positive relief,"I’ve been dealing with acid reflux and LPR for the past 9 months. I’ve been taking PPI and Tums along with some diet changes. It’s been a real mess since I’ve never dealt with this before. 

Recently I’ve made some diet changes in the past 2 weeks that maybe helping. Could be jinxing myself here. 

Daily watermelon and banana for fruit 

2 TBSP of chia seed with coconut yogurt - this is my breakfast most mornings 

1 cup coffee or no coffee at all. This was hard. 

High fiber bread with light butter. I found this Hero brand at Whole Foods, it had 13g of fiber per slice. 

High fiber pita bread. Added salad kits with little meat for lunch. 

I personally feel the fiber has been key. It’s not completely gone but I haven’t had to take tums at night and my stomach isn’t burning all the time. 

Idk how long this will last. But I’d highly recommend very high fiber bread to increase fiber intake. 

I’ve been trying this for 2 weeks. I noticed some difference at 1 week. 

Let me know if anyone else has seen improvements from high fiber diet.

  1  
  
  It was a hospital bed, that much appeared certain, though certainty was coming and going. It was narrow and hard and there were shiny metal railings standing sentrylike along the sides, preventing escape. The sheets were plain and very white. Sanitary. The room was dark, but sunlight was trying to creep around the blinds covering the window.  
  
  He closed his eyes again; even that was painful. Then he opened them, and for a long silent minute or so he managed to keep the lids apart and focus on his cloudy little world. He was lying on his back and pinned down by firmly tucked sheets. He noticed a tube dangling to his left, running down to his hand, then disappearing up somewhere behind him. There was a voice in the distance, out in the hallway. Then he made the mistake of trying to move, just a slight adjustment of the head, and it didn’t work. Hot bolts of pain hit his skull and neck and he groaned loudly.  
  
  “Rick. Are you awake?”  
  
  The voice was familiar, and quickly a face followed it. Arnie was breathing on him.  
  
  “Arnie?” he said with a weak, scratchy voice, then he swallowed.  
  
  “It’s me, Rick, thank God you’re awake.”  
  
  Arnie the agent, always there at the important moments.  
  
  “Where am I, Arnie?”  
  
  “You’re in the hospital, Rick.”  
  
  “Got that. But why?”  
  
  “When did you wake up?” Arnie found a switch, and a light came on beside the bed.  
  
  “I don’t know. A few minutes ago.”  
  
  “How do you feel?”  
  
  “Like someone crushed my skull.”  
  
  “Close. You’re gonna be fine, trust me.”  
  
  Trust me, trust me. How many times had he heard Arnie ask for trust? Truth was, he’d never completely trusted Arnie and there was no plausible reason to start now. What did Arnie know about traumatic head injuries or whatever mortal wound someone had inflicted?  
  
  Rick closed his eyes again and breathed deeply. “What happened?” he asked softly.  
  
  Arnie hesitated and ran a hand over his hairless head. He glanced at his watch, 4:00 p.m., so his client had been knocked out for almost twenty-four hours. Not long enough, he thought, sadly.  
  
  “What’s the last thing you remember?” Arnie asked as he carefully put both elbows on the bed’s railing and leaned forward.  
  
  After a pause, Rick managed to say, “I remember Bannister coming at me.”  
  
  Arnie smacked his lips and said, “No, Rick. That was the second concussion, two years ago in Dallas, when you were with the Cowboys.” Rick groaned at the memory, and it wasn’t pleasant for Arnie either, because his client had been squatting on the sideline looking at a certain cheerleader when the play came his way and he was squashed, helmetless, by a ton of flying bodies. Dallas cut him two weeks later and found another third-string quarterback.  
  
  “Last year you were in Seattle, Rick, and now you’re in Cleveland, the Browns, remember?”  
  
  Rick remembered and groaned a bit louder. “What day is it?” he asked, eyes open now.  
  
  “Monday. The game was yesterday. Do you recall any of it?” Not if you’re lucky, Arnie wanted to say. “I’ll get a nurse. They’ve been waiting.”  
  
  “Not yet, Arnie. Talk to me. What happened?”  
  
  “You threw a pass, then you got sandwiched. Purcell came on a weak-side blitz and took your head off. You never saw him.”  
  
  “Why was I in the game?”  
  
  Now, that was an excellent question, one that was raging on every sports radio show in Cleveland and the upper Midwest. Why was HE in the game? Why was HE on the team? Where in the hell did HE come from?  
  
  “Let’s talk about it later,” Arnie said, and Rick was too weak to argue. With great reluctance, his wounded brain was stirring slightly, shaking itself from its coma and trying to awaken. The Browns. Browns Stadium, on a very cold Sunday afternoon before a record crowd. The play-offs, no, more than that—the AFC title game.  
  
  The ground was frozen, hard as concrete and just as cold.  
  
  A nurse was in the room, and Arnie was announcing, “I think he’s snapped out of it.”  
  
  “That’s great,” she said, without much enthusiasm. “I’ll go find a doctor.” With even less enthusiasm.  
  
  Rick watched her leave without moving his head. Arnie was cracking his knuckles and ready to bolt. “Look, Rick, I need to get going.”  
  
  “Sure, Arnie. Thanks.”  
  
  “No problem. Look, there’s no easy way to say this, so I’ll just be blunt. The Browns called this morning—Wacker—and, well, they’ve released you.” It was almost an annual ritual now, this postseason cutting.  
  
  “I’m sorry,” Arnie said, but only because he had to say it.  
  
  “Call the other teams,” Rick said, and certainly not for the first time.  
  
  “Evidently I won’t have to. They’re already calling me.”  
  
  “That’s great.”  
  
  “Not really. They’re calling to warn me not to call them. I’m afraid this might be the end of the line, kid.”  
  
  There was no doubt it was the end of the line, but Arnie just couldn’t find the candor. Maybe tomorrow. Eight teams in six years. Only the Toronto Argonauts dared to sign him for a second season. Every team needed a backup to their backup quarterback, and Rick was perfect for the role. Problems started, though, when he ventured onto the field.  
  
  “Gotta run,” Arnie said, glancing at his watch again. “And listen, do yourself a favor and keep the television turned off. It’s brutal, especially ESPN.” He patted his knee and darted from the room. Outside the door there were two thick security guards sitting in folding chairs, trying to stay awake.  
  
  Arnie stopped at the nurses’ station and spoke to the doctor, who eventually made his way down the hall, past the security guards, and into Rick’s room. His bedside manner lacked warmth—a quick check of the basics without much conversation. Neurological work to follow. Just another garden-variety brain concussion, isn’t this the third one?  
  
  “I think so,” Rick said.  
  
  “Thought about finding another job?” the doctor asked.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  Perhaps you should, the doctor thought, and not just because of your bruised brain. Three interceptions in eleven minutes should be a clear sign that football is not your calling. Two nurses appeared quietly and helped with the tests and paperwork. Neither said a word to the patient, though he was an unmarried professional athlete with notable good looks and a hard body. And at that moment, when he needed them, they could not have cared less.  
  
  As soon as he was alone again, Rick very carefully began looking for the remote. A large television hung from the wall in the corner. He planned to go straight to ESPN and get it over with. Every movement hurt, and not just his head and neck. Something close to a fresh knife wound ached in his lower back. His left elbow, the non-throwing one, throbbed with pain.  
  
  Sandwiched? He felt like he’d been flattened by a cement truck.  
  
  The nurse was back, holding a tray with some pills. “Where’s the remote?” Rick asked.  
  
  “Uh, the television’s broke.”  
  
  “Arnie pulled the plug, didn’t he?”  
  
  “Which plug?”  
  
  “The television.”  
  
  “Who’s Arnie?” she asked as she tinkered with a rather large needle.  
  
  “What’s that?” Rick asked, forgetting Arnie for a second.  
  
  “Vicodin. It’ll help you sleep.”  
  
  “I’m tired of sleeping.”  
  
  “Doctor’s orders, okay. You need rest, and lots of it.” She drained the Vicodin into his IV bag and watched the  
clear liquids for a moment.  
  
  “Are you a Browns fan?” Rick asked.  
  
  “My husband is.”  
  
  “Was he at the game yesterday?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “How bad was it?”  
  
  “You don’t want to know.”  
  
  · · ·  
  
  When he awoke, Arnie was there again, sitting in a chair beside the bed and reading the Cleveland Post. At the bottom of the front page, Rick could barely make out the headline “Fans Storm Hospital.”  
  
  “What!” Rick said as forcefully as possible.  
  
  Arnie snatched the paper down and bolted to his feet. “Are you okay, kid?”  
  
  “Wonderful, Arnie. What day is it?”  
  
  “Tuesday, early Tuesday morning. How do you feel, kid?”  
  
  “Give me that newspaper.”  
  
  “What do you want to know?”  
  
  “What’s going on, Arnie?”  
  
  “What do you want to know?”  
  
  “Everything.”  
  
  “Have you watched television?”  
  
  “No. You pulled the plug. Talk to me, Arnie.”  
  
  Arnie cracked his knuckles, then walked slowly to the window, where he barely opened the blinds. He peered through them, as if trouble were out there. “Yesterday some hooligans came here and made a scene. Cops handled it well, arrested a dozen or so. Just a bunch of thugs. Browns fans.”  
  
  “How many?”  
  
  “Paper said about twenty. Just drunks.”  
  
  “And why did they come here, Arnie? It’s just you and me—agent and player. The door’s closed. Please fill in the blanks.”  
  
  “They found out you were here. A lot of folks would like to take a shot at you these days. You’ve had a hundred death threats. Folks are upset. They’re even threatening me.” Arnie leaned against the wall, a flash of smugness because his life was now worth being threatened. “You still don’t remember?” he asked.  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Browns are up seventeen to zip over the Broncos with eleven minutes to go. Zip doesn’t come close to describing the ass-kicking. After three quarters, the Broncos have eighty-one yards in total offense, and three, count ’em, three first downs. Anything?”  
  
  “No.”  
  
  “Ben Marroon is at quarterback because Nagle pulled a hamstring in the first quarter.”  
  
  “I remember that now.”  
  
  “With eleven minutes to go, Marroon gets drilled on a late hit. They carry him off. No one’s worried because the Browns’ defense could stop General Patton and his tanks. You take the field, third and twelve, you throw a beautiful pass in the flat to Sweeney, who, of course, plays for the Broncos, and forty yards later he’s in the end zone. Remember any of this?”  
  
  Rick slowly closed his eyes and said, “No.”  
  
  “Don’t try too hard.  
  
  “Both teams punt, then the Broncos fumble. With six minutes to go, on a third and eight, you check off at the line and throw to Bryce on a hook, but the ball is high and is picked off by somebody in a white jersey, can’t recall his name but he sure can run, all the way. Seventeen to fourteen. The place is getting tense, eighty thousand plus. A few minutes earlier they were celebrating. First Super Bowl ever, all that jazz. Broncos kick off, Browns run the ball three times because Cooley ain’t about to send in a pass play, and so the Browns punt. Or try to. Snap gets fumbled, Broncos get the ball on the Browns’ thirty-four-yard line, which is no problem whatsoever because in three plays the Browns’ defense, which is really, really pissed at this point, stuffs them for fifteen yards, out of field goal range. Broncos punt, you take over at your own 6, and for the next four minutes manage to cram the ball into the middle of the defensive line. The drive stalls at midfield, third and ten, forty seconds to go. Browns are afraid to pass and even more afraid to punt. I don’t know what Cooley sends in, but you check off again, fire a missile to the right sideline for Bryce, who’s wide open. Right on target.”  
  
  Rick tried to sit up, and for a moment forgot about his injuries. “I still don’t remember.”  
  
  “Right on target, but much too hard. It hits Bryce in the chest, bounces up, and Goodson grabs it, gallops to the promised land. Browns lose twenty-one to seventeen. You’re on the ground, almost sawed in half. They put you on a stretcher, and as they roll you off the field, half the crowd is booing and the other half is cheering wildly. Quite a noise, never heard anything like it. A couple of drunks jump from the stands and rush the stretcher—they would’ve killed you—but security steps in. A nice brawl ensues, and it, too, is all over the talk shows.”  
  
  Rick was slumped over, low in the bed, lower than ever, with his eyes closed and his breathing quite labored. The headaches were back, along with the sharp pains in the neck and along the spine. Where were the drugs?  
  
  “Sorry, kid,” Arnie said. The room was nicer in the darkness, so Arnie closed the blinds and reassumed his position in the chair, with his newspaper. His client appeared to be dead.  
  
  The doctors were ready to release him, but Arnie had argued strongly that he needed a few more days of rest and protection. The Browns were paying for the security guards, and they were not happy about it. The team was also covering the medicals, and it wouldn’t be long before they complained.  
  
  And Arnie was fed up, too. Rick’s career, if you could call it that, was over. Arnie got 5 percent, and 5 percent of Rick’s salary wasn’t enough to cover expenses. “Are you awake, Rick?”  
  
  “Yes,” he said, with his eyes still closed.  
  
  “Listen to me, okay.”  
  
  “I’m listening.”  
  
  “The hardest part of my job is telling a player that it’s time to quit. You’ve played all your life, it’s all you know, all you dream about. No one is ever ready to quit. But, Rick, ole buddy, it’s time to call it quits. There are no options.”  
  
  “I’m twenty-eight years old, Arnie,” Rick said, with his eyes open. Very sad eyes. “What do you suggest I do?”  
  
  “A lot of guys go into coaching. And real estate. You were smart—you got your degree.”  
  
  “My degree is in phys ed, Arnie. That means I can get a job teaching volleyball to sixth graders for forty thousand a year. I’m not ready for that.”  
  
  Arnie stood and walked around the end of the bed, as if deep in thought. “Why don’t you go home, get some rest, and think about it?”  
  
  “Home? Where is home? I’ve lived in so many different places.”  
  
  “Home is Iowa, Rick. They still love you there.” And they really love you in Denver, Arnie thought, but wisely kept it to himself.  
  
  The idea of being seen on the streets of Davenport, Iowa, terrified Rick, and he let out a soft groan. The town was probably humiliated by the play of its native son. Ouch. He thought of his poor parents, and closed his eyes.  
  
  Arnie glanced at his watch, then for some reason finally noticed that there were no get-well cards or flowers in the room. The nurses told him that no friends had stopped by, no family, no teammates, no one even remotely connected to the Cleveland Browns. “I gotta run, kid. I’ll drop by tomorrow.”  
Walking out, he nonchalantly tossed the newspaper on Rick’s bed. As soon as the door closed behind him, Rick grabbed it, and soon wished he had not. The police estimated a crowd of fifty had staged a rowdy demonstration outside the hospital. Things got ugly when a TV news crew showed up and began filming. A window was smashed, and a few of the drunker fans stormed the ER check-in, supposedly looking for Rick Dockery. Eight were arrested. A large photo—front page beneath the fold—captured the crowd before the arrests. Two crude signs could be read clearly: “Pull the Plug Now!” and “Legalize Euthanasia.”  
  
  It got worse. The Post had a notorious sportswriter named Charley Cray, a nasty hack whose specialty was attack journalism. Just clever enough to be credible, Cray was widely read because he delighted in the missteps and foibles of professional athletes who earned millions yet were not perfect. He was an expert on everything and never missed a chance for a cheap shot. His Tuesday column—front-page sports—began with the headline: “Could Dockery Top All-Time Goat List?”  
  
  Knowing Cray, there was no doubt Rick Dockery would top the list.  
  
  The column, well researched and savagely written, was structured around Cray’s opinions about the greatest individual chokes, screwups, and collapses in the history of sports. There was Bill Buckner’s booted ground ball in the ’86 World Series. Jackie Smith’s dropped TD pass in Super Bowl XIII, and so on.  
  
  But, as Cray screamed at his readers, those were only single plays.  
  
  Mr. Dockery, on the other hand, managed three—Count Them!—three horrible passes in only eleven minutes.  
  
  Clearly, therefore, Rick Dockery is the unquestioned Greatest Goat in the history of professional sports. The verdict was undisputed, and Cray challenged anyone to argue with him.  
  
  Rick flung the newspaper against the wall and called for another pill. In the darkness, alone with the door closed, he waited for the drug to work its magic, to knock him out clean, then, hopefully, to take him away forever.  
  
  He slipped lower in the bed, pulled the sheet over his head, and began crying.  
  
  Chapter  
  
  2  
  
  It was snowing and Arnie was tired of Cleveland. He was at the airport, waiting for a flight to Las Vegas, his home, and against his better judgment he made a call to a lesser vice president of the Arizona Cardinals.  
  
  At the moment, and not including Rick Dockery, Arnie had seven players in the NFL and four in Canada. He was, if he could be forced to admit it, a mid-list agent who, of course, had bigger ambitions. Making phone calls for Rick Dockery was not going to help his credibility. Rick was arguably the most-talked-about player in the country at that dismal moment, but it wasn’t the kind of buzz that Arnie needed. The vice president was polite but brief and couldn’t wait to get off the phone.  
  
  Arnie went to a bar, got a drink, and managed to find a seat far away from any television, since the only story still raging in Cleveland was the three interceptions by a quarterback no one even knew was on the team. The Browns had rolled through the season with a sputtering offense but a bruising defense, one that shattered records for yielding so few yards and points. They lost only once, and with each win a city starved for a Super Bowl became more and more enthralled with their old lovable losers. Suddenly, in one quick season, the Browns were the slayers.  
  
  Had they won the previous Sunday, their Super Bowl opponent would be the Minnesota Vikings, a team they shut out and routed back in November.  
  
  The entire city could taste the sweetness of a championship.  
  
  It all vanished in eleven horrifying minutes.  
  
  Arnie ordered a second drink. Two salesmen at the next table were getting drunk and relishing the Browns’ collapse. They were from Detroit.  
  
  The hottest story of the day had been the firing of the Browns’ general manager, Clyde Wacker, a man who had been hailed as a genius as recently as the preceding Saturday but was now the perfect scapegoat. Someone had to be fired, and not just Rick Dockery. When it was finally determined that Wacker had signed Dockery off waivers, back in October, the owner fired him. The execution was public—big press conference, lots of frowns and promises to run a tighter ship, et cetera. The Browns would be back!  
  
  Arnie met Rick during his senior year at Iowa, at the end of a season that had begun with much promise but was fading into a third-tier bowl game. Rick started at quarterback his last two seasons, and he seemed well suited for a dropback, open-style offense so rare in the Big Ten. At times he was brilliant—reading defenses, coolly checking off at the line, firing the ball with incredible velocity. His arm was amazing, undoubtedly the best in the upcoming draft. He could throw long and hard with a lightning-quick release.  
  
  But he was too erratic to be trusted, and when Buffalo picked him in the last round, it should have been a clear sign that he needed to pursue a master’s degree or a stockbroker’s license.  
  
  Instead, he went to Toronto for two miserable seasons, then began bouncing around the NFL. With a great arm, Rick was just barely good enough to make a roster. Every team needs a third-string quarterback. In tryouts, and there had been many, he’d often dazzled coaches with his arm. Arnie watched one day in Kansas City when Rick threw a football eighty yards, then a few minutes later clocked a bullet at ninety miles an hour.  
  
  But Arnie knew what most coaches now strongly suspected. Rick, for a football player, was afraid of contact. Not the incidental contact, not the quick and harmless tackle of a scrambling quarterback. Rick, with good reason, feared the rushing tackles and the blitzing linebackers.  
  
  There is a moment or two in every game when a quarterback has a receiver open, a split second to throw the ball, and a massive, roaring lineman charging the pocket unblocked. The quarterback has a choice. He can grit his teeth, sacrifice his body, put his team first, throw the damned ball, make the play, and get crushed, or he can tuck it and run and pray he lives for another play. Rick, as long as Arnie had watched him play, had never, not once, put the team first. At the first hint of a sack, Rick flinched and ran frantically for the sideline.  
  
  And with a propensity for concussions, Arnie really couldn’t blame him.  
  
  He called a nephew of the owner of the Rams, who answered the phone with an icy “I hope this is not about Dockery.”  
  
  “Well, yes, it is,” Arnie managed to say.  
  
  “The answer is hell no.”  
  
  Since Sunday, Arnie had spoken with about half of the NFL teams. The response from the Rams was pretty typical. Rick had no idea how completely his sad little career had been terminated.  
  
  Watching a monitor on the wall, Arnie saw his flight get delayed. One more call, he vowed. One more effort to find Rick a job, and then he would move on to his other players.  
  
  · · ·  
  
  The clients were from Portland, and though his last name was Webb and she was as pale as a Swede, they both claimed Italian blood and were keen to see the old country where it all began. Each spoke about six words of the language, and spoke them badly. Sam suspected they had picked up a travel book at the airport and memorized a few of the basics over the Atlantic. On their previous trip to Italy their driver/guide had been a native with “dreadful” English, and so they had insisted on an American this time around, a good Yank who could arrange meals and find tickets. After two days together, Sam was ready to ship them back to Portland.  
  
  Sam was neither a driver nor a guide. He was, however, very much an American, and since his primary job paid little, he moonlighted occasionally when his countrymen passed through and needed someone to hold their hands.  
  
  He waited outside in the car while they had a very long dinner at Lazzaro’s, an old trattoria in the center of the city. It was cold and snowing lightly, and as he sipped strong coffee, his thoughts returned to his roster, as they always did. His cell phone startled him. The call was from the United States. He said hello.  
  
  “Sam Russo please,” came a crisp greeting.  
  
  “This is Sam.”  
  
  “Coach Russo?”  
  
  “Yes, that’s me.”  
  
&n  
bsp; The caller identified himself as Arnie something or other, said he was an agent of some sort, and claimed to have been a manager on the 1988 Bucknell football team, a few years after Sam played there. Since they both went to Bucknell, they quickly found common ground, and after a few minutes of Do-You-Know-So-and-So they were friendly. For Sam, it was nice to chat with someone from his old school, albeit a total stranger.  
  
  And it was rare that he got calls from agents.  
  
  Arnie finally got to the point.  
  
  “Sure I watched the play-offs,” Sam said.  
  
  “Well, I represent Rick Dockery, and, well, the Browns let him go,” Arnie said.  
  
  No surprise there, Sam thought, but kept listening. “And he’s looking around, considering his options. I heard the rumor that you need a quarterback.”  
  
  Sam almost dropped the phone. A real NFL quarterback playing in Parma? “It’s not a rumor,” he said. “My quarterback quit last week and took a coaching job somewhere in upstate New York. We’d love to have Dockery. Is he okay? Physically I mean?”  
  
  “Sure, just bruised a little, but he’s ready to go.”  
  
  “And he wants to play in Italy?”  
  
  “Maybe. We haven’t discussed it yet, you know, he’s still in the hospital, but we’re looking at all the possibilities. Frankly, he needs a change of scenery.”  
  
  “Do you know the game over here?” Sam asked nervously. “It’s good football, but it’s a far cry from the NFL and the Big Ten. I mean, these guys are not professionals in the true sense of the word.”  
  
  “What level?”  
  
  “I don’t know. Tough to say. Ever hear of a school called Washington and Lee, down in Virginia? A nice school, good football, Division III?”  
  
  “Sure.”  
  
  “They came over last year during spring break and we scrimmaged them a couple of times. Pretty even matchup.”  
  
  “Division III, huh?” Arnie said, his voice losing some steam.  
  
  But then, Rick needed a softer game. Another concussion and he might indeed suffer the brain damage so often joked about. Truthfully, Arnie didn’t care. Just another phone call or two and Rick Dockery was history.  
  
  “Look, Arnie,” Sam began earnestly. Time for the truth. “It’s a club sport over here, or maybe a notch above that. Each team in the Series A gets three American players, and they usually get meal money, maybe some rent. The quarterbacks are typically American and they get a small salary. The rest of the roster is a bunch of tough Italians who play because they love football. If they’re lucky and the owner is in a good mood, they might get pizza and beer after the game. We play an eight-game schedule, with play-offs, then a chance for the Italian Super Bowl. Our field is old but nice, well maintained, seats about three thousand, and for a big game we might fill it. We have corporate sponsors, cool uniforms, but no TV contract and no real money to speak of. We’re smack in the middle of the world of soccer, so our football has more of a cult following.”  
  
  “How did you get there?”  
  
  “I love Italy. My grandparents emigrated from this region, settled in Baltimore, where I grew up. But I have lots of cousins around here. My wife is Italian and so on. It’s a delightful place to live. Can’t make any money coaching American football, but we’re having fun.”  
  
  “So the coaches get paid?”  
  
  “Yes, you could say that.”  
  
  “Any other NFL rejects?”  
  
  “Occasionally one passes through, some lost soul still dreaming of a Super Bowl ring. But the Americans are usually small college players who love the game and have a sense of adventure.”  
  
  “How much can you pay my man?”  
  
  “Let me check with the owner.”  
  
  “Do that, and I’ll check with my client.”  
  
  They signed off after another Bucknell story, and Sam returned to his coffee. An NFL quarterback playing football in Italy? It was hard to imagine, though not without precedent. The Bologna Warriors were in the Italian Super Bowl two years earlier with a forty-year-old quarterback who’d once played briefly for Oakland. He quit after two seasons and went to Canada.  
  
  Sam turned the car heater down a notch and replayed the final minutes of the Browns-Broncos game. Never in his memory had he watched one player so completely engineer a defeat and lose a game that was so clearly won. He himself had almost cheered when Dockery was carried off the field.  
  
  Nevertheless, the idea of coaching him in Parma was intriguing.  
  
  Chapter

  Though the packing and leaving was somewhat of a ritual, the departure from Cleveland was a bit more stressful than usual. Someone found out that he had leased a condo on the seventh floor of a glass building near the lake, and there were two shaggy reporter types with cameras loitering near the guardhouse when Rick wheeled through in his black Tahoe. He parked underground and hurried up the elevator. The phone in the kitchen was ringing when he unlocked the door. A pleasant voice mail was left behind by none other than Charley Cray.  
  
  Three hours later the SUV was packed with clothes and golf clubs and a stereo. Thirteen trips—he counted them—up and down the elevator, and his neck and shoulders were killing him. His head ached and throbbed and the painkillers did little to help. He wasn’t supposed to drive while drugged, but Rick was driving.  
  
  Rick was leaving, running away from the lease on the condo and the rented furniture therein, fleeing Cleveland and the Browns and their awful fans, scampering away to somewhere. He wasn’t quite sure where.  
  
  Wisely, he had signed only a six-month lease on the condo. Since college he’d lived a life of short leases and rented furniture and learned not to accumulate too many things.  
  
  He fought the downtown traffic and managed to glance in the mirror for one last look at the Cleveland skyline. Good riddance. He was thrilled to be leaving. He vowed to never return, unless, of course, he was playing against the Browns, but then he’d promised himself that he would not think about the future. Not for another week anyway.  
  
  As he raced through the suburbs, he admitted to himself that Cleveland was undoubtedly happier with his departure than he was.  
  
  He was drifting west, in the general direction of Iowa, not with any enthusiasm, because he was not excited about going home. He’d called his parents once from the hospital. His mother asked about his head and begged him to stop playing. His father asked him what the hell he was thinking when he threw that last pass.  
  
  “How are things in Davenport?” Rick had finally asked his father. Both knew what he was after. He wasn’t curious about the local economy.  
  
  “Not too good,” his father said.  
  
  A weather bulletin caught his attention. Heavy snow to the west, a blizzard in Iowa, and Rick happily turned left and headed south.  
  
  An hour later his cell phone buzzed. It was Arnie, in Vegas, sounding much happier.  
  
  “Where are you, kid?” he asked.  
  
  “I’m out of Cleveland.”  
  
  “Thank God. Going home?”  
  
  “No, I’m just driving, going south. Maybe I’ll go to Florida and play some golf.”  
  
  “Great idea. How’s your head?”  
  
  “Fine.”  
  
  “Any additional brain damage?” Arnie asked with a fake laugh. It was a punch line Rick had heard at least a hundred times.  
  
  “Severe damage,” he said.  
  
  “Look, kid, I’m onto something here, a spot on a roster, guaranteed starting position. Gorgeous cheerleaders. Wanna hear it?”  
  
  Rick repeated it slowly, certain that he had misunderstood the details. The Vicodin was soaking a few areas of his tender brain. “Okay,” he finally said.  
  
  “I just talked to the head coach of the Panthers, and they will offer a contract right now, on the spot, no questions asked. It’s not a lot of money, but it’s a job. You’ll still be the quarterback, the starting quarterback! A done deal. It’s all you, baby.”  
  
  “The Panthers?”  
  
  “You got it. The Parma Panthers.”  
  
  There was a long pause as Rick struggled with geography. Obviously it was  
some minor-league outfit, some independent bush league so far from the NFL that it was a joke. Surely it wasn’t arena football. Arnie knew better than to think about that.  
  
  But he couldn’t place Parma. “Did you say Carolina Panthers, Arnie?”

1mu7t9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bushwick/comments/1mu7t9d/observations_after_moving_to_bushwick/,Observations After Moving to Bushwick,"Just felt like sharing some observations after moving to the neighborhood 3 months ago. Please respond and tell me why I’m an idiot or have it wrong.. but these are my takes. My background: W Male mid30s lived in NYC since 2011 (East Village, Astoria, Midtown, Fort Greene, Park Slope, Bushwick in that order). We saved our money and were lucky enough to be able to purchase a home in Bushwick. I came to nyc out of SUNY college with debt and zero dark daddy money… I’m proud to be in Bushwick. 

There is a real sense of community here. This doesn’t exist in park slope where everyone is trying to one up each other with their fancy euro vacations and hamptons homes. People that live here stay here on the weekends and contribute to the local community. Those who say it’s a shit hole or “no one takes responsibility” are simply just here for the $18 dollar mixed drinks north of Maria Hernandez and are sad bc they don’t live in Greenpoint. I haven’t felt this way since being in Astoria. I’ve felt extremely welcome by my neighbors despite being a white bread transplant. It’s incredible how saying hello or what’s up
To someone consistently on your way to work or the cafe /grocer can change how you feel in your day to day environment. 

It’s dirty: there is more dog poop and broken glass compared to neighborhoods west of Bushwick, but it’s just as bad as certain parts of Manhattan (Korea town, Hell’s Kitchen, LES). I think people complain way too much about the grit. If you don’t stay glued to your phone you’re fine. I’ve actually felt like it’s Improved too since moving here in the spring but could be nose blind. Go hang on grand concourse in BX and let me know how it compares…. 

Bushwick horse girl / Dark daddy money = all true: this is real and is happening in this neighborhood. I have observed numerous people on the sidewalk having straining convos with their parents about money outside their new build apartments. This will only continue imo after seeing what happened to fort Greene / Greenpoint / Clinton hill. 

It’s still New York City… there are tweakers under the subways but they don’t bother you if you don’t make eye contact. Pretty simple and btw that exists in any other area in NYC. Be smart. If you’re afraid of homeless people, move to the suburbs. 

The access to NYC is impeccable: I think Myrtle / broadway will someday be like Atlantic avenue. They will run the new cross Brooklyn subway line through there. You can get to willyb, downtown bk, downtown Manhattan, or midtown with ease as long as the trains operate well. Don’t sleep on the bus especially for going downtown BK. 

Unlike park slope, lesbian Karen doesn’t exist here. People here worry about themselves rather than those around them and don’t take things for granted. 

Groceries: There are plenty of vegetable stands ( Mr kiwi , Maria Hernandez farmers market) but grocers are hit / miss on prices / quality. Foodtown expanded but it’s quite expensive imo. Lots of people hit WF / TJs in willyb / LES and commute home. 

You can be who you want to be here.. and that’s why people live here (plus the semi more affordable housing an accessibility) 

Food & Bars: there are better restaurants than park slope / fort Greene but comparable eats to Williamsburg. There are a treasure trove of family oriented spots towards ridgewood that won’t last if that neighborhood continues to go that way so get it while it’s hot. In general, bar scene is 8/10.. something for everyone. Also Obscure coffee is an amazing spot for anyone who loves beans 

Parking is no sweat, they don’t always check alternate side but you shouldn’t have an issue in moving your car most times of the day.

1mu7swe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mu7swe,The #1 Forecasting Mistake That Kills Small Businesses (And How to Fix It Today),"# The Forecast Accuracy Myth: Embrace Ranges, Not Lines

Let's be honest. As a small business owner, you've probably spent countless hours hunched over a spreadsheet, trying to nail down that perfect number. That single, solitary figure that represents next quarter's revenue, next year's profit, or the budget for your next big project. We've all been there, chasing a mythical beast called ""forecast accuracy."" We tweak our assumptions, refine our models, and hold our breath, hoping we've predicted the future with pinpoint precision.

But what if I told you that this entire pursuit is a trap? What if the relentless quest for a single, ""accurate"" number is not only impossible but is actively harming your business?

It’s time to shake up some professional assumptions. The truth is, the future isn't a single point on a line; it's a spectrum of possibilities. The most resilient, agile, and successful businesses understand this. They've moved beyond the illusion of certainty and have embraced a more realistic, powerful, and strategic approach: **range-based forecasting**.

This isn't just a semantic shift. It's a fundamental change in how you think about **forecasting**, **budgeting**, and your entire Financial Planning & Analysis (**FP&A**) process. It's about trading false precision for genuine preparedness.

# The Tyranny of the Single Number

For decades, traditional business wisdom has preached the gospel of the single-point forecast. Your budget is a set of hard lines. Your revenue target is one number. Your sales goal is a specific figure. The problem? The real world is messy, unpredictable, and refuses to conform to our neat little spreadsheet cells.

Think about the last time you created a detailed forecast. You likely built it on a mountain of assumptions:

* The economy will grow at X%.
* Our biggest client will renew their contract.
* Our new marketing campaign will generate Y leads.
* Our key supplier won't raise prices.
* A new competitor won't suddenly emerge.

Each of these assumptions is, at best, an educated guess. A single-point forecast takes all these guesses and multiplies them together, creating a fragile chain of dependencies. If just one of those assumptions proves wrong—and they often do—the entire forecast collapses.

This leads to a vicious cycle:

1. **The Missed Forecast:** You inevitably miss the target, either coming in over or under.
2. **The Blame Game:** Time and energy are wasted figuring out *why* the forecast was ""wrong."" Was the sales team not aggressive enough? Did marketing overpromise?
3. **The False Correction:** You adjust your model, convinced you've ""learned your lesson,"" and create a new, equally fragile single-point forecast.
4. **The Repeat:** The cycle begins anew, eroding confidence in the **FP&A** process and fostering a culture of fear around missing targets.

This obsession with a single number forces your team into a defensive crouch. Instead of thinking strategically about opportunities and risks, they become fixated on hitting an arbitrary number. Innovation is stifled because new ideas introduce uncertainty. Smart risks are avoided because they might jeopardize the forecast. The business becomes rigid, brittle, and slow to adapt—a death sentence in today's dynamic market.

# The Power of the Range: From Prediction to Preparation

Range-based forecasting frees you from this tyranny. Instead of predicting a single outcome (e.g., ""We will generate $1.2 million in revenue next year""), you forecast a spectrum of possibilities (e.g., ""Based on our analysis, we expect revenue to land between $1.05 million and $1.35 million"").

This might seem like a subtle change, but its implications are profound.

**1. It Reflects Reality.** A range acknowledges what you already know intuitively: the future is uncertain. It honestly represents the variables at play. A wider range might signal higher market volatility or the early stages of a new product launch. A narrower range might reflect a stable, mature market. It immediately communicates the level of confidence and risk associated with the plan.

**Example:** Imagine you're launching a new coffee shop. A single-point forecast might target $30,000 in monthly revenue. But what if the new office building planned for across the street has its opening delayed by six months? What if a competing café opens two blocks away?

A range-based forecast would account for this.

* **Pessimistic Case ($22,000/month):** The office opening is delayed, and a competitor opens.
* **Base Case ($30,000/month):** Things go mostly as planned.
* **Optimistic Case ($38,000/month):** The office opens on time, and your new loyalty program is a massive hit.

Your forecast is now a range: **$22,000 - $38,000**. You haven't just created a forecast; you've created a strategic map.

**2. It Shifts the Conversation from ""What"" to ""What If.""** This is the most critical benefit. When your team reviews a range, the discussion is no longer about hitting one specific number. Instead, you start asking more powerful, strategic questions:

* ""What actions do we need to take to ensure we hit at least the low end of the range?"" (Risk Mitigation)
* ""What signs will tell us we're trending toward the low end, and what's our contingency plan if that happens?"" (Early Warning Systems)
* ""What opportunities or investments could push us toward the high end of the range?"" (Growth Strategy)
* ""If we hit the high end, how will we deploy that extra capital? Can we hire faster? Invest in more inventory?"" (Upside Planning)

Suddenly, your **budgeting** and **forecasting** meetings are transformed from backward-looking critiques into forward-looking strategy sessions. You're no longer predicting the future; you're preparing to win in multiple possible futures.

**3. It Builds Credibility and Reduces Anxiety.** When you present a single number to your team, your bank, or your investors, you are implicitly making a promise you can't keep. When you miss it, trust is eroded.

Presenting a well-reasoned range does the opposite. It shows that you have thought critically about the potential risks and opportunities. It demonstrates strategic maturity. This builds confidence and reduces the anxiety associated with the all-or-nothing pressure of a single target. Your team is empowered to make smart decisions, knowing they have a framework for navigating uncertainty, rather than being punished for failing to predict it.

# How to Implement Range-Based Forecasting: A Practical Guide

Moving from single-point forecasts to ranges doesn't require a Ph.D. in statistics or expensive software. It requires a shift in mindset and process. Here’s how to get started.

**Step 1: Identify Your Key Drivers and Variables** What are the 2-3 most significant factors that influence your business performance? Don't get lost in the weeds. Focus on the big levers.

* For a retail business, it might be foot traffic, average transaction value, and inventory costs.
* For a SaaS company, it could be new user sign-ups, churn rate, and customer acquisition cost.
* For a consulting firm, it might be billable hours, project pipeline, and average project size.

**Step 2: Create a ""Best Guess"" Base Case** This is your traditional, single-point forecast. It represents the most likely outcome if your primary assumptions hold true. This will become the midpoint of your range.

**Step 3: Define Your Optimistic and Pessimistic Scenarios (The Bookends)** Now, ask the ""what if"" questions for each key driver.

* **Optimistic (Best Case):** What if everything goes right? What if that big deal closes early? What if our marketing campaign goes viral? Quantify this. If your base case for new leads is 100, maybe the optimistic case is 150.
* **Pessimistic (Worst Case):** What if things go wrong? What if your biggest client cuts their budget? What if a key employee leaves? What if shipping costs double? Quantify this as well. Maybe the pessimistic lead forecast is 60.

**Best Practice:** Involve your team in this process. Your sales leader has the best feel for the top end of the pipeline. Your operations manager understands the potential supply chain risks. Crowdsourcing these assumptions makes them more robust and creates buy-in across the organization.

**Step 4: Build Your Financial Model Around the Scenarios** Run the numbers for each of your three scenarios—pessimistic, base, and optimistic. This will give you the low end, midpoint, and high end of your forecast range for key metrics like revenue, costs, and profit.

**Example: A Simple Revenue Range Forecast**

Let's say you run a small marketing agency. Your key driver is the number of active clients.

* **Base Case:** You expect to have 10 clients, each paying an average of $5,000/month.
   * *Forecast:* 10 clients \* $5,000 = **$50,000/month**
* **Pessimistic Case:** You lose one client unexpectedly and only sign one of your two pipeline prospects.
   * *Forecast:* 9 clients \* $5,000 = **$45,000/month**
* **Optimistic Case:** You retain all clients and sign a larger-than-expected new client for $8,000.
   * *Forecast:* 11 clients \* $5,270 (new average) = **$58,000/month**

Your monthly revenue forecast is now a range: **$45,000 - $58,000**.

**Step 5: Plan and Act Based on the Range** This is where the magic happens. Your range is not just a reporting tool; it's a decision-making framework.

* **Cash Flow Planning:** ""We need to ensure we have enough cash reserves to cover our expenses even if we only hit the $45,000 low end for three consecutive months.""
* **Hiring Decisions:** ""We won't hire that new project manager until we are consistently hitting above the $50,000 midpoint of our range.""
* **Investment Triggers:** ""If we hit the $58,000 high end for two months in a row, we will trigger our plan to invest in new CRM software.""

Your **budgeting** process becomes dynamic. Instead of a rigid, static document, you have a flexible plan with pre-defined triggers based on where you fall within your forecasted range. This is the heart of modern, effective **FP&A**.

# Embrace the Uncertainty, Win the Future

The world's most innovative companies, from tech startups to global giants, have moved away from the forecast accuracy myth. They understand that in a world of constant change, the ability to adapt is far more valuable than the ability to predict.

As a small business owner, you have an advantage. You are nimble. You can implement this shift in mindset faster than a large corporation. By ditching the single-line forecast and embracing the range, you will:

* **Make Better, Faster Decisions:** Armed with a clearer understanding of potential outcomes.
* **Build a More Resilient Business:** Prepared for downturns and ready to capitalize on upturns.
* **Foster a Culture of Strategic Thinking:** Empowering your team to plan for possibilities, not just chase a number.

Stop chasing the ghost of perfect accuracy. The future will never fit neatly on a single line. Embrace the messiness. Embrace the uncertainty. Embrace the range. It’s the most accurate and honest way to navigate the path ahead and build a business that doesn't just survive, but thrives.

1mu7qde,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1mu7qde/these_will_be_the_most_loweffort_language/,These will be the most low-effort language learning tips you’ll ever try,"I used to tell my friends all the time back in college, “I’m really gonna start learning a second language this time. Then I’d open my notebook, write the first page neatly, and the rest stayed blank. It wasn’t that I didn’t have time. It was that every time I thought about studying, I pictured a formal setup: quiet desk, book laid out, an hour of focus. Just imagining it made me tired.

One day I flipped the approach. Instead of making extra time for study, I started sneaking the language into things I already do. Like background music that is always there but never in the way. And somehow it stuck. Here’s what has been working for me.

1. Have a “language moment” every day
For me it’s breakfast. While I make coffee or fry an egg, I make myself describe what I’m doing in my target language. It’s short, simple, and builds the habit of switching my brain into that mode every day.

2. Change your device language
I switched my phone to my target language. The first day was chaos and even setting an alarm felt like solving a puzzle.
A week later I could recognize common words instantly without translating. I even started writing my to-do list in the language: buy milk, send email, finish reading. Tiny things like this slowly rewire your thinking.

3. Make entertainment count
I rewatch shows with only target-language subtitles. Friends got three full runs from me and each time I learned something new.
On TikTok or YouTube I searched for vlogs in my target language once, and the algorithm started showing me more every day. It feels like cheating but it works.

4. Use dead time and track it
My commute is about 40 minutes. It used to be pure doomscrolling. Now I use it to listen to podcasts or audiobooks in my target language. I use Nooka app to subscribe to books and podcasts I like. It automatically sends me fresh content I actually enjoy, and the daily streak tracker is addictive. Watching the progress bar fill up is like feeding a virtual pet, and I just don’t want to miss a day.

5. Speak with people and don’t care if it’s messy
I once had a “target language only” coffee date with a friend. We messed up constantly, laughed a lot, and I left feeling more confident.
When I don’t have a partner, I join interest groups on Reddit or Discord. Strangers do not care if you are clumsy and the conversations feel more real.

Don’t worry about perfect study sessions. Just focus on getting a little exposure every day.
Find tools and methods that slide into your routine instead of taking it over.

When your target language shows up in the moments you live through most often, you’ll keep at it without even thinking about it.

If you’re feeling stuck, give this a shot for one day. Work it into breakfast or your commute. It might feel small at first, but the effect really stacks up over time.",18,1755574874.0,languagelearning,0,0.95,False

Despite the fact that I would always be distracted, daydreaming entire worlds, overstimulated, high energy, etc I still excelled at whatever I was doing until one day things just didn’t click for me any more. From middle school onwards I have been struggling basically just surviving because no one would take me seriously not even my parents who are boomers and believe in toughing things out. 

I remember once I reached the age of consent I immediately asked my pcp to test me for it and it just so happened that the day of that appointment she was out of office and a male doctor came in for her and brushed my symptoms away as just lack of sleep or drinking too much coffee in the morning and mild anxiety at the age of 16. Even though I begged him to please give me the exam he just figured I’d grow out of it. 

I’m now in my last year of college and I have barely scrapped by and it was only until this July 2025 that I’m finally being treated and I genuinely think it’s because I am male passing and presenting despite them knowing I’m trans and my symptoms presenting like how they typically do in women. I had asked my new pcp to refer me to psych and they got right to it. 

All those years of constant struggle for what. Although I’m happy I’m finally on Ritalin and being treated for it I’m still angry for the me who lived day by day visibly female presenting.

**Odds Breakdown: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Miami Marlins (-1.5 runs, -200 moneyline) are the clear favorites here, with implied win probabilities hovering around **59%** across bookmakers. The Cardinals (+1.5, +200) are the underdogs, with implied odds of **46%**, suggesting bookmakers see Miami as the more likely winner. The total runs line is locked at **8.0**, with even money on Over/Under—meaning this game is expected to be a pitcher’s duel or a low-scoring slugfest (baseball’s version of a “tense staring contest”).

The Marlins’ spread of -1.5 runs is significant. In baseball terms, this isn’t just “we think they’re better”—it’s “we think they’ll outscore you by a run and a half if you blink.” For the Cardinals, +1.5 is a lifeline: bet on them, and you’re essentially saying, “Miami will score less than two runs, and St. Louis will avoid looking like a rookie league team.”

**News Digest: Injuries, Shenanigans, and One Overachieving Pitcher**  
Let’s start with the Marlins. Their ace, **José Ureña**, has been pitching like he’s been drinking 10 cups of coffee and channeling Nolan Ryan’s ghost. He’s struck out 15 batters in his last two starts while allowing just 2 runs. Meanwhile, the team’s shortstop, **Isan Diaz**, has been so dominant at turning double plays that the Cardinals’ hitters are now plotting a rebellion. “We’ve hired a therapist for our swing,” joked one Cardinal, “because it’s getting *traumatized* by Diaz’s glovework.”

Now, the Cardinals. Their star outfielder, **Harrison Bader**, is out with a **hamstring injury** sustained during a pre-game game of “how many times can I trip over my own spikes?” (Answer: too many.) Backup outfielder **Jordan Walker** is stepping in, which is like asking a toddler to solve a Rubik’s Cube—well-intentioned, but not exactly inspiring. To make matters worse, the Cardinals’ s

I can't help but feel this growing excitement every time the topic comes up. Imagine logging in on a Monday, and while you're sipping your coffee, half your ops have already whirred into life: invoices are zipping across accounts, customer service tickets sorted (and even answered), and your marketing campaigns are going live—no caffeine required. YES, it’s happening right now, everywhere!

Here's why I'm honestly *thrilled* about this wave:

- **Time becomes yours again.** All those soul-draining repetitive tasks? Hand them to your digital partner, so you can level up your creativity instead.
- **Error rates? Who's she?** Automated processes don’t have “bad days."" No more missed zeroes or skipped emails because someone was multitasking.
- **Scaling becomes almost fun.** Add a hundred new clients? Duplicate workflows. No sweat, just more happy customers.

Every day, a new tool appears—AI-driven assistants, smart CRMs, end-to-end process bots. Some feel like toys, others instantly become the core of your workflow.

What really gives me a buzz is:

- The way a *tiny tweak* (like an automated email sequence or data entry pipeline) suddenly gives your team time to breathe.
- Teams discovering energy again, because they’re not stuck in spreadsheet purgatory and can focus on wild, fun projects.

But… (and this is important!) Business Automation is **not** about replacing people. It’s about empowering them to do more *joyful, meaningful work.* Think less robot takeover, more robot sidekick!

If you’re excited about this future—

- Where your job gets *nicer* as boring bits vanish,
- Where businesses become not just faster, but happier too,
- Where ""work"" feels just a tad more like play,

—then I want to hear your automation wins, surprises, and “aha” moments! 

What automations made your week easier or your team's vibe happier?  
What rookie automation mistake made you facepalm... only to laugh about it later?

After seven years of covert training, she, a genius nurtured by the state, finally returned home. She found her aunt living lavishly in her late parents' mansion while her sister slept in a dog kennel and ate slop. She sabotaged their business with swift vengeance, and her aunt's company collapsed overnight.
=====
""You've weathered countless storms over the years. Welcome home, Arabella.""
At the celebratory dinner, a young man in a perfectly tailored suit found himself unwilling to look away from Arabella Stanley. 
She possessed an otherworldly beauty, her sharp features sculpted with precision and wrapped in an aura of cool detachment. 
Her piercing eyes revealed nothing of her inner thoughts, and when she spoke, her voice carried the same arctic chill. ""I'm leaving now.""
Joshua Willis, the young man, seized the moment without hesitation. ""Allow me to drive you home.""
Arabella offered no resistance. 
The car glided through the night. The city lights blurred past as Joshua stole glances at her profile.
""When do you plan to return to the company? Our empire continues to flourish.""
Their partnership had begun years ago through a chance project, and Joshua had witnessed Arabella's brilliance firsthand. 
He had persuaded her to join forces, and together they had forged a company that now dominated the entire industry. 

Arabella maintained her measured tone. ""I'll decide when the time feels right. For now, I simply want to reach home.""

""Understood completely. You must be eager to reunite with Daisy. She's undoubtedly thriving. I've been directing all the premium projects to your aunt's husband throughout these years."" Joshua's grin widened as he angled for recognition. 

Arabella and her twin sister Daisy Stanley had lost their parents at the tender age of six, and their aunt Meagan Tucker had stepped in to care for them both. 

Arabella acknowledged him with a subtle nod. ""I appreciate that.""

Her delicate fingers found the cherry blossom pendant resting against her throat, clicking it open to reveal a treasured photograph of herself and Daisy. 

Arabella's expression remained stoic in the image, but Daisy's smile blazed with pure joy. 

Studying her sister's radiant face, Arabella felt an unfamiliar warmth soften her features. 

After their parents' tragic death, Arabella and Daisy had become each other's entire world. Daisy had always been their family's ray of sunshine, illuminating every room she entered. 

At twelve, Arabella had been handpicked by the government for a classified operation that consumed seven years of her life. Now that the mission had concluded, she could finally return to Daisy. 

She had forwarded nearly every government paycheck to her sister, ensuring Daisy lived in comfort and security. 

Joshua's eyes widened in amazement as he witnessed Arabella's smile. 

The legendary ice queen was actually smiling? 

His curiosity about Arabella's sister intensified dramatically. 

The car approached an upscale residential community, where each house boasted its own meticulously maintained garden. 

The vehicle glided to a stop in front of a house. 

This was the home Arabella's parents had bequeathed to them, now shared between Meagan and Daisy. 

The estate glowed with warm light, alive with the sound of cheerful laughter. 

Daisy seemed to be flourishing beautifully. 

With that thought in mind, Arabella preserved her gentle smile as she crossed into the front yard. 

A weathered doghouse sat in the corner of the property. 

Someone knelt beside it in the shadows. 

Through the dim evening light, Arabella couldn't distinguish the person's features, but she watched them scooping food directly from the bowl placed on the ground. 

Why would someone be eating beside the doghouse? 

Concern creased her brow as Arabella approached cautiously. 

The figure appeared startled and scrambled quickly into the doghouse. 

Arabella's bewilderment deepened. Then a soft, trembling voice drifted from within the shelter.

""Please don't strike me again. I won't make any mistakes. I'll be so much more careful...""

That voice belonged to Daisy. 

Arabella's heart shattered instantly. She lunged forward, pulling the figure from the doghouse. Even in the pale moonlight, she recognized her beloved sister immediately. 

Daisy stared back, her eyes swimming with disbelief. ""You..."" she breathed, as though she feared her mind was playing cruel tricks on her. 

""Daisy, is that truly you?"" Arabella's voice trembled with disbelief. 

When Daisy nodded weakly, a glacial fury erupted within Arabella, her eyes igniting with volcanic rage. 

""Bella..."" Daisy whispered, still trapped in shock. ""You've actually come back?""

The moment felt impossibly surreal to Daisy, like a vision conjured from desperate longing. 

Arabella, sensing something terribly wrong, reached out to touch Daisy's forehead. Her skin burned with fever. 

Before Arabella could process this discovery, Daisy crumpled into her arms like a broken doll. 

Arabella cradled her sister, whose body felt heartbreakingly frail and ice-cold despite the raging fever consuming her. 

Arabella's heart crystallized into something harder than diamond. 

The front door of the house suddenly burst open with violent force. 

""Daisy, you worthless creature! It's been several minutes, and you're still not finished eating? Get inside immediately and wash those dishes!"" Meagan's voice sliced through the night air like a bl**e. 

Arabella pivoted slowly, her predatory gaze locking onto her target. 

Meagan had transformed dramatically over the years. 

Once haggard and perpetually exhausted, she now radiated wealth and privilege, adorned in an expensive designer coat and gleaming jewelry that caught the porch light, presenting herself as the very embodiment of refined elegance. 

Meagan's bl**d turned to ice under Arabella's lethal stare. ""You... Arabella? When did you arrive?""

""What have you done to her?"" Arabella advanced with calculated steps, her voice dropping to a menacing whisper. 

Meagan instinctively retreated, unsettled by the predatory intensity burning in Arabella's eyes. But she quickly rallied her confidence, reminding herself that Arabella was still just a young woman. 

She twisted her lips into a cruel sneer. ""Daisy shattered a dish, so I administered appropriate punishment. You've been absent for years. Do you possess any understanding of how challenging life has been here? I never allowed her to starve or sleep without shelter. If you weren't my brother's daughters, I wouldn't have wasted my time with either of you.""

In one fluid motion, Arabella's hand shot out and seized Meagan by the throat, her expression transforming into something carved from arctic stone. 

Meagan ga**ed desperately, clawing at Arabella's iron grip. ""Let... me... go...""

""This is my house,"" Arabella declared, her voice carrying the finality of a death sentence, her eyes radiating lethal intent.

""You forced Daisy to perform menial labor. You made her sleep in that doghouse like an animal. You possess remarkable audacity, Meagan.""

In the warm light streaming from the house, Arabella finally saw what Daisy had been consuming. It was the leftover food. 

Holding her sister, who felt as weightless as a dying bird and appeared ghostly pale and utterly drained, Arabella felt her heart shatter into countless pieces. 

Her precious sister had endured this nightmare! 

""Meagan,"" Arabella said, her voice saturated with deadly promise, ""when you moved into our home, you swore a sacred oath that you would care for Daisy.""

Meagan bristled at Arabella's bold use of her first name, the disrespect cutting deep. 

But she shrank backward when she witnessed the murderous gleam dancing in Arabella's eyes. 

Arabella had always been fundamentally different from other children. She was cold and fearlessly bold. 

When Arabella had lived here, Meagan had performed the role of a dutiful aunt, though barely meeting even the lowest standards. 

But the moment Arabella departed, Meagan had seized absolute control, systematically crushing the gentle-spirited Daisy beneath her cruel authority. 

She had never imagined Arabella would return to witness her crimes. 

""I did take care of Daisy! She made a mistake, so I disciplined her accordingly. What's so terrible about that?"" 

Meagan's words died in her throat as Arabella's grip tightened mercilessly, making her feel as though death itself was reaching for her soul. 

""Arabella?"" The violent commotion finally drew the attention of the people inside. Meagan's husband and daughter noticed the deadly confrontation unfolding at their door. 

Through the wide open front door, Arabella observed them living luxuriously in a spacious and magnificently decorated villa, with a table overflowing with exquisite delicacies.

The people inside wore expensive clothing that spoke of comfort and abundance. 

Meanwhile, Daisy had been sleeping in a doghouse, consuming leftovers. Arabella's eyes burned with unshed tears as the devastating truth crashed over her with overwhelming force. 

Chapter 2 Can You Check Who Made The Payment
Khloe Tucker was fuming. 

""Let go of my mom, Arabella! Back then, she offered to take care of you and Daisy out of kindness. Is that how you repay her? You show up after disappearing for years, acting like you're some kind of hero? What, did you run off, get pr**nant, and have a kid or something? What a joke!""

Khloe threw Arabella a nasty glare, but deep down, she actually hoped Arabella might stay. Having her back would mean more help around the house. 

But Arabella's eyes had already gone cold. Without saying a word, she entered the house and kicked the dining table hard. 

Dishes flew everywhere, crashing onto the floor and shattering into pieces. 

Before anyone could react, Arabella grabbed two vases and hurled them straight at Khloe and her father. 

They hit them squarely, and bl**d started trickling down their faces as they screamed in shock. 

Her voice was ice. ""You've got one day. Get out of my house."" Without waiting for a reply, she stormed out with Daisy in her arms. 

She flagged down the first taxi she saw and rushed her sister straight to a hospital. 

Back at the villa, chaos broke out. 

""Mom! That psycho actually attacked me!"" Khloe sobbed, staring at the scratches on her face in the mirror. ""What if I'm left with scars?""

Meagan's fury boiled over. ""She's gotten way too bold after all these years! If she shows her face again, she won't be so lucky. We're not nobodies anymore. We've joined hands with Norman Group. There's no way she can stand against us!""

She gave Khloe a comforting pat. ""Don't worry, honey. I'm taking you to a hospital right now.""

***

At the hospital, the doctor examined Daisy and frowned. ""Her leg's been broken for a while, and she's covered in bruises. Some of her teeth are missing too. What kind of sister lets this happen?""

Arabella's voice was low. ""It's my fault.""

Her bangs fell over her eyes, hiding whatever she was feeling inside. 

The doctor, noticing how quiet she was, spoke gently. ""I've done what I could for now. But if someone's been hurting you two, you need to report it. Keeping quiet won't fix anything.""

Arabella gave a small nod and moved to stand beside Daisy's hospital bed. 

Daisy, now nineteen, looked heartbreakingly fragile. Her thin frame looked like it couldn't support itself, and her wrists seemed more like twigs than limbs. 

Her short hair was uneven, dry, and choppy, like someone had taken scissors to it without a second thought. 

Arabella gently lifted the blanket, and her heart dropped. 

Daisy's skin told a horrifying story. Old whip marks crisscrossed her legs, and dark burn spots marred her arms.

Each scar screamed of cruelty. Arabella's breath caught, and before she could stop them, tears rolled down her cheeks. 

""Bella..."" Daisy's voice was barely a whisper. 

Arabella immediately reached for her hand. ""I'm here,"" she said softly. 

""I... missed you,"" Daisy murmured, her voice hoarse. 

Arabella clutched her hand like a lifeline. ""I missed you too. I thought if I worked hard, I could give you a better life. But I was wrong. I never should've left you alone. I swear, I'm not going anywhere again.""

The warmth in Arabella's voice seemed to melt Daisy's tension. Slowly, her expression softened. 

After making sure Daisy was settled, Arabella went to sort out the payment. 

""The charges have already been covered,"" the nurse said with a kind smile. 

Arabella blinked. ""What? Who paid?""

Joshua crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed the thought. There was no way he knew about this yet. 

""Can you check who made the payment?"" she asked. 

The nurse gave an apologetic shake of the head. ""Sorry, that information's private. Maybe a family member helped out?""

At the word family, Arabella's face turned to stone. She gave a short nod and walked off without another word. If someone had helped, she was going to find out who. 

Meanwhile, down the corridor, Meagan strolled beside her daughter, Khloe, who was fresh out of the emergency room with her face patched up. 

""I'm not letting Arabella walk away from this,"" Khloe snarled, bitterness burning in her voice. 

""Calm down,"" Meagan said sharply. ""You'll reopen your stitches if you keep flaring up like this. Be more like your sister--grace under pressure.""

That seemed to cheer Khloe up. A smug smile tugged at her lips.

""As long as my sister keeps shining, that's all that matters. She's the youngest dancer in the Griridge Troupe now. Daisy really thought she could outshine her? She was delusional. That broken leg was karma, if you ask me. And if my sister finds out how Arabella treated me--oh, she'll tear her apart.""

""She's got a big show coming up,"" Meagan reminded her. ""Let's not distract her. One step at a time.""

She tapped Khloe's nose lightly, but then her expression stiffened as she spotted Arabella ahead. 

Khloe saw Arabella too, and just the sight of her brought back the sting of humiliation. Her rage boiled over. 

Without thinking, she grabbed her studded handbag and swung it with all her strength toward Arabella's back. 

Arabella's instincts kicked in. Just as she turned around, a tall man came into view. With quick reflexes and strong arms, he grabbed the bag mid-air by its strap, stopping it like it was nothing. 

The sudden pull made Khloe lose her balance, and with a startled scream, she fell to the floor. 

Chapter 3 Grab Your Things And Come With Me
""Khloe!"" Meagan hurried to her daughter's side, helping her up while shooting a vicious glare at the man who had shown up out of nowhere. 

""Who the h**l are you? Arabella's new guy or what?""

The man didn't bother responding. His sharp eyes gave nothing away, cold and unreadable, like the still, deep sea that hid its danger. 

Then he began walking toward Meagan, each step loud and heavy on the hospital floor. 

Meagan instinctively took a step back. Her ch**t tightened, making it hard to breathe. 

Deep down, something told her this man wasn't just any stranger--he was trouble. 

Trying to mask her unease, she snapped, ""Arabella, you'd better think twice before crossing us again. You and your sister were lucky we let you stay at all! If you ever want back in, come crawling, and maybe we'll consider it.""

Yanking Khloe's arm, Meagan stormed off. 

Arabella stood silently, watching them go. Let them stay? That house was legally Daisy's and hers. 

She glanced at the man and caught sight of a pi**ol, just for a second, before it disappeared beneath his jacket. Her eyes narrowed slightly. 

Who was this guy? 

He turned and looked directly at her. Arabella finally saw his face--handsome as h**l, rough around the edges, and those icy eyes didn't blink or soften for anyone. 

He gave off a vibe that screamed danger--Arabella had never felt anything like it. 

No surprise Meagan bolted--anyone with sense would have. 

""Arabella Stanley,"" he said. His tone was calm and low, but there was a chill in it that made her skin prickle. 

Arabella glanced him over. ""You're the one who paid for my sister, right?""

He gave a faint nod. ""You're quick. Grab your things and come with me.""

Arabella's brows drew together. ""Excuse me?""

Who even was this guy, showing up with mystery and attitude? 

Before things got tenser, another man stepped in--less intimidating but equally serious.

""Miss Stanley, allow me to explain. This is Mr. Asher Gordon. His father and your dad served together in the military. Before his father passed away, he asked Mr. Gordon to watch over your family. Mr. Gordon only recently returned from service and has been trying to track you down since.""

That explained the military presence, the icy calm... the way he moved like someone trained for war. 

Arabella studied Asher again. He didn't seem threatening now, but just closed off, like someone with a wall too thick to climb over. 

She stayed calm. ""You got anything to back that up? Anyone can say that.""

Asher reached into his pocket and pulled out a weathered photo. 

It showed two men in dusty uniforms--one was definitely her father. The other looked a lot like him. 

She stared at it for a long moment before replying, ""I'll think about it.""

""Fair. Let's exchange numbers,"" Asher replied without any small talk. 

Arabella added his contact. His WhatsApp display was just a solid black box. 

Funny enough, hers was the same. 

A strange little coincidence, she thought. 

Then the assistant added her as well. ""Dominick Powell, Mr. Gordon's right hand. Reach out if you need help with anything, anytime.""

Arabella gave a nod. ""Got it.""

With that, the two men walked off, and Arabella made her way back to Daisy's room. 

Shortly after, two silent, suited bodyguards appeared at the door--they were clearly sent by Asher. 

Arabella didn't ask questions. She got to work helping Daisy clean up--changing her into fresh clothes and gently washing her hair, trying to fix its brittle, uneven mess. 

But when she saw the scars and ci**rette burns covering Daisy's body, her eyes welled up again. 

Holding back her tears, she carefully rubbed her homemade cream onto the wounds. Then, without wasting a second, she opened her laptop. 

She had to find out what had happened to Daisy while she was gone, so she hacked into the villa's security system. 

Sadly, what she saw made her sick to her stomach. 

It wasn't long after Arabella left that Daisy was thrown out of her own bedroom and made to sleep in a doghouse. 

The cheerful, lively sister Arabella remembered didn't smile anymore. 

She saw footage of Daisy juggling multiple part-time jobs, only to get ha**ssed and pushed around. 

Even so, she kept working hard and made it into one of the top universities. But during her very first semester, she ended up with a broken leg. 

She was studying dance, and just like that, the injury shattered everything she had dreamed of. 

The pieces fell into place too easily. Khloe's sister, Elissa Tucker, was in the same class. Arabella's gut told her that leg injury hadn't been some fluke. 

After that, Daisy barely left the house. She was treated like hired help, scrubbing floors, cooking meals, and still sleeping out in that d**n doghouse. 

Yet every time Daisy texted her, it was the same lie. ""I'm doing fine. Don't worry about me. You just take care of yourself.""

Arabella's vision blurred. 

While her sister was being broken piece by piece, their aunt's family was thriving. Their business had taken off, thanks to a lucrative deal with the Vanguard Group. 

Khloe, a middle school dropout, was suddenly a digital influencer. Elissa was famous and popular in the college. 

Meagan was rubbing shoulders with high-society ladies, and her husband had become some corporate hotshot. 

Arabella clenched her jaw and slammed her fist against the table. She didn't even feel the sting. 

Every bit of success she had worked for... had only served to feed that vile family's greed. 

And the one person she had sworn to protect had suffered in silence the entire time. 

Chapter 4 This Revenge Is Mine To Carry Out
Arabella took a slow breath, wiped the tears from her cheeks, and her eyes turned cold, like a fire had been snuffed out and replaced with ice.

Her fingers gripped her phone tightly as she made a call. ""That major project--it hasn't been handed over to the Tucker Group yet, right? Cancel it. Completely."" Her voice was calm but firm.

""And get to the Griridge Hospital. Now.""

On the other end, Joshua sounded startled. ""Arabella? What's going on?""

""You'll see when you get here. Bring a few things with you.""

True to form, Joshua didn't waste time. Less than half an hour later, he rushed into the hospital, and the moment his eyes landed on the girl in the hospital bed, he froze like a statue.

She looked so much like Arabella--same face, but all color drained, bruised, battered, her body wrecked like it had been thrown away and forgotten. 

Joshua's fists clenched. ""Who did this? Tell me who it was. I'll make them pay, I swear it!""

That was the sister of a preeminent figure... and they treated her like this? 

Arabella didn't flinch. ""I'll handle it myself. Slowly,"" she muttered, picking up a pair of sc**sors from the table. 

Before Joshua could react, the sc**sors had already cut through her long, silky hair. The strands dropped to the floor in silence. 

He stared, stunned. ""Arabella... you're not actually...""

""I am,"" she said. ""This revenge is mine to carry out.""

Joshua swallowed hard, goosebumps rising on his arms. 

The way she said it--it was clear. H**l was coming for someone. 

Arabella glanced at him. ""Also, what do you know about the Gordons?""

""The Gordon family?"" He immediately straightened. 

""They're legendary. Way beyond the top elite families. Super wealthy, but incredibly discreet. I've only ever worked with the right-hand man of their current CEO.""

""You mean Dominick Powell?"" Arabella asked casually. 

Joshua's jaw dropped. ""Wait, you know Dominick? Don't tell me... are you saying the Gordons were involved in what happened to Daisy?""

Arabella gave him a blank stare before calmly explaining Asher's connection and what he had said earlier. Joshua slapped his thigh, clearly overwhelmed. 

""Asher Gordon? If it's really him, then yeah, no one's faking that. He leads the family. Rumor has it he's ex-special forces, quiet as a ghost, but deadly. If someone crosses him, they don't get a second chance.""

Arabella didn't react. She just stared at the floor, her thoughts turning in circles. 

Then she spoke, steady and cold. ""You should head out now. Also... sell my villa.""

Joshua hesitated. ""That place... that's your parents' home. Are you sure?""

Arabella looked over at Daisy's fragile frame. ""She was tortured in that house. There's no comfort left there. Just get rid of it.""

Her voice cracked slightly. ""And if possible, find a buyer who's impossible to deal with.""

Joshua gave her a long look, then nodded. ""Understood. I've got a bunch of properties lined up. If you ever need a place, it's yours.""

""Thanks.""

She didn't look up, and Joshua, sensing she needed space, quietly slipped out the door. 

Left alone, Arabella gently held Daisy's hand and murmured, ""I swear, everyone who hurt you... I'll make them pay for it tenfold.""

That night felt endless, and sleep didn't come. 

The next morning, Arabella stood quietly outside a dance studio at Griridge University's dance department, listening through the open door. 

""Elissa, things have been so dull without that pathetic girl around,"" someone inside snickered. 

""I know, right? No one to fetch us coffee, no one to mess with. It's no fun without a punching bag,"" another chimed in. 

Peering through the glass window, Arabella spotted Elissa in the middle of the dance studio. 

Years ago, Elissa had been just a pale, skinny kid. Now she was dressed in a flowing white dance outfit, all elegance and grace, like something out of a dream. 

Surrounded by classmates, Elissa flashed a gentle, modest smile at the comments. ""Guys, don't say that. Let's not be mean.""

""You're too kind, Elissa,"" Joyce Lambert, her good friend, scoffed. ""That girl sponged off your family for years. If it were me, I'd have thrown her out of your house on day one.""

Arabella narrowed her eyes slightly. 

Calling it their house? Seriously? 

That place belonged to her and Daisy. Elissa and her family were the ones living off of them. 

Elissa tilted her head, her voice syrupy sweet. ""She's my cousin, after all. Her parents passed away. If we didn't take her in, she would've had nowhere to go.""

Her fake compassion earned gasps of admiration from the crowd. 

What a generous soul, they all seemed to think. 

The loud chatter in the dance studio instantly stopped the moment Arabella walked in. 

""Daisy?"" Joyce blinked in surprise. 

She stared at Arabella, stunned. She looked the same, but... something about her felt different now. 

Chapter 5 Got Yourself A Su**r Daddy
The dance studio fell silent, as if someone had hit pause. 

Every single eye was locked on Arabella, but she acted like she didn't see a thing and confidently made her way to the back, where she began stretching like it was just another day. 

Joyce's jaw clenched. ""Daisy, you've got some nerve showing up out of nowhere like this!"" Joyce barked, marching over and swinging a sharp kick at her.

""Just because we've gone easy on you doesn't mean you're not taking orders from us!""

But Arabella moved with ease, dodging the kick without breaking a sweat. Joyce lost her balance and hit the floor face-first with a loud, painful thud. 

""You dodged me?"" Joyce screeched in disbelief. Her face turned red with fury as she raised her hand to s**p Arabella. 

But just like before, Arabella slipped out of reach like a shadow. Joyce's swing caught nothing but air, and she stumbled forward, grabbing her lower back with a wince. ""D**n it!""

""My bad,"" Arabella said gently, her voice almost too soft to catch. 

Joyce wanted to explode, but something about Arabella's calmness made her hesitate. 

She didn't dare swing again. Instead, she snapped, ""What are you just standing there for? Get over here and help us stretch already!""

""So, Daisy's really back,"" she thought smugly. ""Still the same pathetic errand girl.""

Arabella's gaze briefly darkened, but she gave a polite nod like an obedient student. 

She knelt beside Joyce and began helping her with leg stretches. Joyce smirked. ""You look even sadder than before. Honestly, it's pathetic.""

But then, a painful scream cut through the air. 

Joyce's leg jolted, and she broke into a cold sweat, grabbing her thigh. ""My leg... what the h**l? Did you snap my leg?""

The class crowded around her in a frenzy. 

""Is she alright? Someone call for help!""

""Look, the teacher just walked in!""

Their panic was cut short as the teacher entered the room. 

Arabella still had Joyce's leg in her hands. Calmly, almost casually, she gave it a subtle twist. 

""Ah!"" Joyce screamed even louder, nearly in tears from the pain. 

""What's going on in here?"" The teacher frowned, scanning the chaos. 

""My leg! It feels broken... I can't--"" Joyce wailed, then blinked in confusion. Just seconds later, she could move it again. ""Wait... what?""

""You look fine to me."" The teacher shot a look at Joyce--one that wasn't exactly sympathetic. She had seen enough of these girls' antics over the years.

""I don't care what drama you're cooking up on your own time, but today's important. The Griridge Troupe selection is happening. The dean and senior faculty will be here shortly, so I expect everyone to act like professionals.""

""I swear, I..."" Joyce began, trying to protest. 

""That's enough."" Elissa cut her off, stepping forward with an easy smile. ""Let's not waste more time. Joyce, calm down.""

Elissa's tone made it clear--this wasn't the time to pick fights. 

Joyce had no choice but to bite her tongue and swallow her anger, though her glare at Arabella could have burned through steel. 

The teacher clapped her hands, and class began. 

During the last twenty minutes, a few other teachers showed up to observe. 

By the time class ended, the room was filled with a mix of nervous energy and excited chatter. 

""God, I really hope I get picked. Dancing alongside Elissa would be a dream come true.""

""Elissa, don't forget us when you're famous!"" someone teased. 

Elissa gave her signature angelic smile. ""Of course not. You're all my people.""

Then someone dropped a name that made the entire class go silent. ""They say Isabella might be watching today.""

Gasps rippled through the room. 

Even Elissa blinked in shock, her breath catching. Isabella Wallace was the icon of modern dance. 

Her performances were legendary, her choreography unrivaled. Just being seen by her could open doors. 

""If Isabella notices me, that's it. That's my breakthrough,"" Elissa thought, her gaze sharpening with quiet ambition.

But then someone spoke up, disrupting the mood. ""I saw Daisy dancing earlier. Honestly, she wasn't bad at all.""

Joyce scoffed loud enough for the room to hear. ""Daisy? Please. She's pathetic. No way she'd get picked.""

Turning her attention to Daisy, she said, ""Hey, what are you still doing here, anyway? Go get our lunch. You remember our order, right?""

Without a word, Arabella nodded and walked off, her tall frame moving with a silent elegance despite the slump in her shoulders. 

""Ugh. Even the way she walks is irritating. Does she actually think she's all graceful or something? What a complete eyesore!"" Joyce sneered. 

By the time Joyce, Elissa, and the rest of their group showed up at the cafeteria, laughing and cracking jokes, Arabella already had their meals prepared.

Her eyes quietly scanned each of them--calm, blank, giving nothing away. But in her mind, she was taking note of everything. 

Joyce, whose father ran the Lambert Group, was spoiled beyond belief and filthy rich. 

Next to her was Kenzie Marsh--the meek, glasses-wearing music student who practically worshipped the ground Elissa walked on. 

And behind them, the two guys were followers, plain and simple. They were all muscle without a mind. 

Joyce looked at the food Arabella had bought and narrowed her eyes. ""Well, well. Where'd you get the cash, huh? Got yourself a su**r daddy? I thought you were broke, freeloader.""

Joyce kept running her mouth but still dove into the food--everyone was starving after dancing all morning. 

However, midway through eating, something went terribly wrong. Joyce coughed violently, bl**d trickling from her lips as she clutched her throat, her eyes wide in panic. 

The others followed suit, gasping, hands around their necks, as if something sharp was tearing through their throats. 

""It burns--what's happening?"" they wh**zed, struggling to speak as pain ripped through them. 

Elissa stared at her in disbelief, still holding her throat. ""Daisy... what did you do?""

""That little bi**h's getting revenge!"" Joyce screamed, losing it completely. ""You think Elissa letting you tag along means we'll go easy on you? You're dead!""

Furious, she flung her food tray at Arabella, while the two boys beside her instinctively lunged forward, ready to grab her without hesitation. 

Chapter 6 Do You Have Any Proof
The students nearby were numb to this kind of chaos. 

""Alright, that's enough,"" Elissa said, her voice sounding gentle on the surface but hollow beneath it. 

She stayed comfortably seated, not bothering to step in--after all, she never did when things got ugly. 

Meanwhile, Arabella, calm and collected, didn't even flinch. When the tray came flying her way, she calmly reached up and caught it in one smooth motion. 

The momentum flipped the tray's course, and it slammed straight into one of the two boys' faces. 

The food, laced with slivers of glass, sliced across his skin, and bl**d trickled down his cheek in thin, terrifying lines. ""S**t! That hurts!"" he cried out. 

One look at the bl**d was enough, and he collapsed in panic, completely out cold. 

The other guy didn't back down. Snarling, he reached for Arabella's hair, yanking it hard. ""You think you're tough, Daisy? Huh?""

His fist flew toward her face, but Arabella caught it mid-swing like it was nothing. His expression froze. She slowly twisted his arm until his knees buckled. 

""Ahhh! It hurts--stop, please! I'm sorry!"" he howled, his face turning as pale as chalk. 

The second she let go, he hit the floor and curled into himself, sobbing in pain. 

One of the girls considered helping, but after seeing Arabella in action, she backed off without a word. 

What a bunch of clowns. 

Arabella stared at them, her gaze sharp and cold, like she was looking at tr**h. 

""Have you lost your fu**ing mind?"" Joyce screeched, still in denial. Her hands shook as she picked up a chair and hurled it with all her strength. 

Arabella shifted her weight, spun, and kicked the chair right back--slamming it into Joyce's head. Bl**d splattered instantly. 

Elissa jumped up in horror, shrieking, ""Oh my God!""

The cafeteria exploded with shouts. ""She's gonna k**l someone! Go find a teacher!""

""What is wrong with her? Is she high or something?""

""Honestly, she's kind of a badass...""

""Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!""

Thirty minutes later, the university president's office was a pressure cooker. 

The fight was way too intense to sweep under the rug. Daisy, Elissa, and the rest of the group were hauled in for questioning. 

Joyce and the others had been bandaged up, but their egos were just as bruised.

Elissa looked ready to cry, still rubbing her sore throat like it had swallowed fire. She was furious, terrified the damage was permanent. 

""Call your parents,"" the president ordered Arabella sharply, trying to make sense of the madness. ""Now.""

Joyce jumped in before Arabella could speak. ""She can't. Her parents are dead!"" she sneered.

""She's been mooching off Elissa's family for years. No morals. No manners. Just expel her already!""

Taken aback, the president looked Arabella up and down. ""So, what exactly happened?""

Joyce didn't miss a beat. ""She put glass in our food. She tried to hurt us and then went berserk. She needs to face consequences!""

Arabella didn't even blink. Her voice came out calm and cold. ""Do you have any proof? And while we're at it--did I even lay a finger on you first? Pretty sure your side started swinging.""

""Liar!"" Joyce snapped, trying to keep the panic out of her voice. 

Arabella turned her gaze to the president, cool and steady. ""Why don't we pull up the cafeteria security footage?""

Silence dropped like a stone. Joyce's face stiffened, and her jaw clenched tight. ""We only hit her because she gave us food full of glass! She deserved it!""

Arabella tilted her head slightly. ""Where's your proof that I put it there?"" she asked softly. ""Because I have proof of something else.""

She pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. A video began to play. 

The footage was damning. It showed Joyce and her gang shoving a sandwich filled with glass into Daisy's mouth. As Daisy's lips b**d, they laughed like it was some sick joke. 

It was raw and unforgivable. Arabella's ch**t tightened as she watched it, the pain as fresh as the day she found it on Daisy's phone. 

Even the president's face shifted. He turned to Joyce and her friends with a sharp, icy glare. For a split second, panic flashed across their faces. 

Trying to smooth things over, Elissa quickly said, ""Sir, yeah, Joyce went too far, and we're really sorry. But Daisy was talking tr**h first--Joyce just lost her temper.""

Arabella raised an eyebrow, unimpressed. ""Is that so? Well then, I'll just upload this little clip online and let the public decide who the real victim is.""

""Absolutely not!"" the president barked. ""Miss Stanley, if that video gets out, it'll drag the university through the mud. Let's not blow this out of proportion. Apologize to each other, and we'll call it even.""

Joyce looked outraged. ""What? She beat the crap out of us! Why should we just let it go?""

Her friends chimed in, just as outraged. 

Meanwhile, Elissa leaned toward the president and whispered with a sweet smile, ""My dad's set to donate $1 million to the school. Just thought you should know.""

The president's expression shifted. His tone changed. 

""Daisy,"" he began, ""what they did was wrong. But your response was excessive. This could've been handled differently. You can either apologize now and move forward, or you'll be expelled. And if you upload that video, trust me, public opinion won't be on your side. That would be reckless.""

Arabella stared at him. So that was what this was. 

Now she understood why Daisy had been stepped on for so long. 

These people weren't protecting students--they were protecting their pockets. 

Joyce, smelling victory, leaned back with a smug grin.

""Daisy, you really thought you had the upper hand? You're nothing but a parasite clinging to Elissa's family like a leech. Don't act like you matter. You want to stay here? Then get on your knees and l**k my shoes clean. Maybe, just maybe, I'll let you off the hook.""

Joyce looked at Arabella like she wasn't even human. 

Elissa didn't say anything at first, but the fire burning behind her calm expression gave her away. Her throat still hurt, and what bothered her more was the embarrassment. 

Deep down, she wanted to lash out at Arabella. But on the outside, she just let out a quiet sigh, like she was more hurt than mad. 

""Daisy, I honestly don't know what happened to you,"" she said. ""But if you can't apologize to us, then pack your things. You're no longer welcome in my home.""

The president didn't bat an eye. ""That's enough. You're done here. Pack up and get out."" He waved Arabella off like she was a fly in the room before turning to Elissa with a tight smile. ""You're injured. Go rest. We'll take care of everything.""

Joyce smirked, finally feeling like the universe had balanced itself. With their heads held high, they all moved to strut out like they had won a prize. 

""Quite the scene,"" came a calm voice from the doorway, all eyes turned. 

Arabella raised an eyebrow. How was he here!

I’m turning 30 in December and in the next few years I’m looking to make a big move.

For some context: I’ve lived in Oregon for a year after high school (about a decade ago) and loved it. Circumstances brought me back to Iowa (my home state) and then eventually lived in Chicago (then back to Iowa, off and on for the last decade). I’m currently residing in Iowa and to be honest, I’ve never enjoyed Iowa and the cons HEAVILY outweigh any pros I have towards the state. But right now I have a stable decent paying job and want to spend the next two or so years saving up and figuring out what’s next.

So that’s what I’m trying to figure out. I really loved Chicago and found the city to have many perks but I’m ready to try something new.

Things I value in my physical location: 1.) walkable: I love being near coffee shops, different shops, restaurants, etc.

2.) nature: living in Oregon for a short period of time made me really value the importance of “touching grass” and I miss that. I’ve tried to California often and all of my favorite places in California involved the coast.

3.) a balance of busy: I love walking outside or in a downtown area and seeing it alive with people out being social and enjoying their area… but the balance of finding little spots that are a little more reserved. I traveled to the east coast for the first time last summer and instantly fell in love with Boston and New York. Obviously both have that hustle and bustle but close enough to escape more east for a getaway when needed.

1mu7a6x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mu7a6x,Beyond the Crystal Ball: 3 Scalable Forecast Models for a Lean Startup,"As a founder, you wear a dozen hats. You’re the CEO, the head of product, the lead salesperson, and often, the janitor. With a to-do list that never ends, who has time for complex financial forecasting? The term itself can conjure images of dense spreadsheets, convoluted formulas, and expensive consultants - things most lean startups simply don’t have the resources for.

But what if I told you that forecasting doesn’t have to be a mystical art reserved for Fortune 500 companies? What if it could be your most powerful tool for making smart decisions, securing funding, and steering your startup toward sustainable growth?

Financial planning and analysis (FP&A) isn't about predicting the future with perfect accuracy. It's about creating a roadmap. It's about understanding the levers in your business so you can pull them intelligently. For a lean startup, a good forecast is a living, breathing guide that helps you navigate the uncertainty of the early stages. It’s the bridge between your grand vision and the day-to-day decisions you make about hiring, marketing spend, and product development.

The key is to find a model that’s right-sized for your team and scalable for your ambition. You need something that provides genuine utility without demanding a dedicated finance team to maintain. Forget the intimidating, 10-tab spreadsheets for a moment. Let’s explore three powerful, scalable forecast models that are perfectly suited for the realities of a lean startup.

# Model 1: The Bottom-Up (Driver-Based) Forecast

The Bottom-Up model is the workhorse of startup forecasting. Instead of starting with a big, audacious revenue goal, you start with the fundamental drivers of your business—the specific, measurable actions that generate revenue. It’s called ""bottom-up"" because you build your revenue projections from the ground up, unit by unit, customer by customer.

This approach forces you to think critically about your operations and sales process. What actually makes the cash register ring? Is it website visitors, sales calls, free trial sign-ups, or something else entirely?

**How It Works:**

The core of a driver-based model is a simple formula:

`Key Activity Driver x Conversion Rate x Average Revenue Per User/Customer = Revenue`

You identify the primary activities that lead to sales and build your forecast based on realistic assumptions about those activities.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Identify Your Core Drivers:** What is the most critical activity in your sales funnel?
   * For a SaaS business, it might be `Demo Requests` or `Free Trial Sign-ups`.
   * For an e-commerce store, it could be `Website Traffic` or `Email Subscribers`.
   * For a service business, it might be `Sales Outreach Calls` or `Proposals Sent`.
2. **Estimate Driver Volume:** How many of these activities can you realistically generate each month? Be honest. Base this on your team's capacity, marketing budget, and early traction. For example, if you have one salesperson, how many calls can they *actually* make?
3. **Determine Conversion Rates:** What percentage of these activities turn into paying customers? If you have historical data, use it! If not, make an educated guess based on industry benchmarks, but be prepared to revise it as real data comes in. A common early-stage mistake is being wildly optimistic here. It's better to be conservative and be pleasantly surprised.
4. **Calculate Average Revenue:** What is the average amount a customer pays you? This could be your average contract value (ACV), average order value (AOV), or monthly recurring revenue (MRR).
5. **Build and Project:** Plug these numbers into a spreadsheet. Start with your current month and project forward for 12-24 months. You can then create scenarios by adjusting your assumptions. What happens if you double your marketing spend and increase website traffic by 50%? What if your conversion rate improves by 1%?

**Example in Action: ""SaaSCo,"" a Lean Startup**

SaaSCo provides project management software for small agencies. Their primary driver is `Free Trial Sign-ups`.

* **Driver:** They currently get 200 free trial sign-ups per month. They plan to increase their content marketing efforts, projecting this to grow by 10% each month.
* **Conversion Rate:** Historically, 5% of trial users convert to paying customers.
* **Average Revenue:** Their single plan costs $50/month per customer.

**Month 1 Forecast:** `200 Trial Sign-ups` x `5% Conversion Rate` = `10 New Customers` `10 New Customers` x `$50/month` = `$500 in New MRR`

**Month 2 Forecast:** `(200 * 1.10) Trial Sign-ups` x `5% Conversion Rate` = `11 New Customers` `11 New Customers` x `$50/month` = `$550 in New MRR` **Total MRR:** `$500 (from Month 1) + $550 (from Month 2) = $1,050`

This model gives SaaSCo a clear, actionable plan. To grow revenue, they know they need to either increase trial sign-ups or improve their trial-to-paid conversion rate. It directly connects their financial goals to their marketing and product activities.

**Pros:**

* **Action-Oriented:** Directly links financial outcomes to operational activities.
* **Highly Realistic:** Grounded in the tangible realities of your business operations.
* **Excellent for Budgeting:** Makes it easy to see the ROI on activities like marketing spend or hiring a new salesperson.

**Cons:**

* **Requires Some Data:** Can be challenging if you have zero operating history.
* **Can Be Complex:** As your business grows with multiple products or channels, the number of drivers can become unwieldy.

# Model 2: The Top-Down (Market Size) Forecast

While the Bottom-Up model starts with what you *can do*, the Top-Down model starts with what’s *possible*. This approach is all about sizing the total market opportunity and then estimating what slice of that pie you can realistically capture.

Investors often like to see a Top-Down analysis because it demonstrates that you’ve thought about the larger strategic landscape and the potential scale of your venture. It answers the question: ""Is this market big enough to be interesting?""

**How It Works:**

The methodology follows a TAM-SAM-SOM framework:

* **Total Addressable Market (TAM):** The total market demand for a product or service. (e.g., The global market for coffee)
* **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):** The segment of the TAM targeted by your products and services which is within your geographical reach. (e.g., The market for coffee in the United States)
* **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM):** The portion of the SAM that you can realistically capture in the near term. This is your target market share.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Define and Size Your TAM:** Use market research reports (Gartner, Forrester, etc.), government data, industry analyses, and competitor reports to find the total annual revenue for your market.
2. **Narrow to Your SAM:** Filter the TAM down to your specific target segment. Are you only targeting businesses of a certain size? A specific geographic region? A particular demographic? Calculate the market size for just that segment.
3. **Realistically Estimate Your SOM:** This is the most critical and difficult step. What percentage of the SAM can you capture in year 1, year 2, and year 3? Your market share won't be 10% overnight. A more realistic starting point might be 0.5% or 1%, growing over time. Your assumptions here should be justified by your marketing strategy, sales team strength, and competitive advantages.
4. **Calculate Revenue:** Multiply your SOM (as a percentage) by your SAM (in dollars) to get your revenue forecast. `Revenue = SAM x % Market Share (SOM)`

**Example in Action: ""PetBox,"" a Lean E-commerce Startup**

PetBox offers a subscription box for organic dog treats, initially targeting millennial dog owners in California.

* **TAM:** The total US pet food market is $40 billion.
* **SAM:** Research shows the organic pet food segment is 15% of the total market ($6 billion). Millennial dog owners in California represent about 5% of that segment.
   * SAM = `$6 billion` x `5%` = `$300 million`.
* **SOM:** The PetBox team believes they can capture 0.5% of their SAM in Year 1, growing to 1.5% in Year 2, based on their planned digital marketing blitz and influencer partnerships.

**Year 1 Forecast:** `$300 million SAM` x `0.5% Market Share` = `$1.5 million in Revenue`

**Year 2 Forecast:** `$300 million SAM` x `1.5% Market Share` = `$4.5 million in Revenue`

This model gives PetBox a high-level strategic target and is incredibly useful for investor pitches.

**Pros:**

* **Strategic Vision:** Shows you understand the market landscape and your potential for scale.
* **Great for Fundraising:** Helps investors quickly grasp the size of the opportunity.
* **Simpler to Start:** Requires less granular operational data than a bottom-up model.

**Cons:**

* **Detached from Reality:** Can produce huge, unrealistic numbers if assumptions are not heavily scrutinized.
* **Not Actionable:** Doesn't tell you *how* you'll capture that market share. It's a goal, not a plan.

**Best Practice:** Use the Top-Down model to set a high-level goal, then use the Bottom-Up model to build a realistic plan to get there. If your Bottom-Up forecast only gets you to 10% of your Top-Down goal, you know there's a disconnect between your plan and your ambition.

# Model 3: The Hybrid (Milestone-Based) Forecast

For very early-stage startups (pre-product or pre-revenue), both of the above models can feel like exercises in pure fiction. When you have no drivers to measure and the market seems distant, how do you plan your finances? The answer is the Hybrid or Milestone-Based model.

This model shifts the focus from revenue forecasting to expense **budgeting**. It’s built around achieving specific, critical milestones and ensures you have enough cash to get there. It’s the ultimate model for lean FP&A because it’s 100% focused on survival and progress.

**How It Works:**

Instead of forecasting revenue, you forecast your expenses and cash runway. The timeline is organized by major business milestones rather than calendar months.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Define Your Next Major Milestones:** What are the 2-3 critical things you must achieve to move the business to the next level?
   * Examples: `Finish MVP Development`, `Acquire First 100 Beta Users`, `Secure First Paying Customer`, `Close a Pre-Seed Funding Round`.
2. **List All Required Tasks:** For each milestone, break down all the tasks and activities required to achieve it. Be exhaustive.
   * To `Finish MVP Development`, you need to pay for servers, software licenses, and potentially a freelance developer.
3. **Estimate Costs for Each Task:** Assign a realistic cost to every single item on your list. This includes salaries (even if deferred), marketing tests, legal fees, software, etc. This is your expense budget.
4. **Calculate Time and Total Burn:** Estimate how long it will take to complete the tasks for each milestone. Sum up the costs to determine your total cash burn to reach that point.
5. **Manage Your Runway:** Your forecast is now a cash runway analysis. If you have $50,000 in the bank and your burn rate to reach the ""Acquire 100 Beta Users"" milestone is $10,000/month, you have 5 months to get there.

**Example in Action: ""InnovateAI,"" a Pre-Revenue Startup**

InnovateAI is building an AI-powered tool for writers. They have $100,000 in initial funding.

* **Milestone 1: Launch Private Beta (Target: 3 Months)**
   * **Tasks & Costs:**
      * Founder Salaries: $5,000/mo x 2 founders x 3 mo = $30,000
      * Server Costs (AWS): $500/mo x 3 mo = $1,500
      * Software Licenses: $1,000 (one-time)
      * Legal (Privacy Policy): $2,000 (one-time)
   * **Total Cost for Milestone 1:** $34,500
   * **Cash Remaining:** $100,000 - $34,500 = $65,500
* **Milestone 2: Onboard 500 Beta Users (Target: 3 Months after M1)**
   * **Tasks & Costs:**
      * Founder Salaries: $30,000
      * Server Costs (scaled): $1,000/mo x 3 mo = $3,000
      * Digital Ad Spend (for user acquisition): $5,000
   * **Total Cost for Milestone 2:** $38,000
   * **Cash Remaining:** $65,500 - $38,000 = $27,500

This forecast tells the InnovateAI founders that they have enough cash to hit their first two major milestones and will have $27,500 left, giving them a buffer as they start working toward their next goal: securing their first paying customers.

**Pros:**

* **Hyper-Focused:** Centers all financial planning on what matters most in the early days: making progress.
* **Manages Risk:** It's fundamentally a tool for managing cash flow and survival.
* **Perfect for Pre-Revenue:** The only truly viable model when you have no revenue data.

**Cons:**

* **Ignores Revenue:** It's not a revenue model and will need to be supplemented once you start generating sales.
* **Can Create Tunnel Vision:** A relentless focus on milestones can sometimes cause you to miss unexpected market opportunities.

# Making Your Forecast a Living Tool

Choosing a model is just the first step. The real value comes from using it. Here are some best practices for making your forecast an indispensable part of your lean startup's toolkit:

* **Document Your Assumptions:** Your forecast is only as good as the assumptions it’s built on. Write them down. Why do you think you can achieve a 5% conversion rate? Where did that market size number come from? This makes it easier to update your model and defend it to investors.
* **Review and Revise Regularly:** A forecast is not a ""set it and forget it"" document. Review it every single month. Compare your actual results to your forecasted numbers (this is called a variance analysis). Where were you right? Where were you wrong? Use these insights to make your next forecast more accurate. This is the heart of effective FP&A.
* **Keep it Simple:** You don't need the world's most complex spreadsheet. A simple, clean model that you understand and use is infinitely better than a perfect, complicated one that gathers dust.
* **Integrate with Budgeting:** Your forecast should inform your budgeting. If your bottom-up model shows that you need 500 demo requests to hit your revenue goal, your marketing budget should clearly allocate funds to the activities that generate those demos.
* **Use the Right Tools:** While you can start with a simple Google Sheet or Excel file, tools like Causal, Jirav, or Pry can help automate the process as you grow, offering more powerful scenario planning and visualization features.

Forecasting for your lean startup isn't about having a flawless crystal ball. It’s about building a smarter, more resilient, and more intentional business. It’s about replacing fear with data, and guesswork with strategy. Pick a model, start simple, and begin building your roadmap to success today.

After taking it home and giving it a clean, I tried brewing my first few espressos with some pregrind Lavazza Qualita Rossa and wasn't disappointed with the initial results.

Myself: 27F, realized I had anxious preoccupied attachment 5 years ago. Have a history of jealousy, volatility, emotional reactivity *only* in romantic relationships. Saved $ and sought therapy which is ongoing, and feel like I’m closely approaching secure.

The guy who dumped me: 35M, hyper independent, loves his career (surgery residency so it’s also quite demanding), very close with his parents esp his dad. Has only had 1 relationship many years ago, she “fucked him up” and was apparently very possessive, volatile, controlling, etc. He casually dated 1 girl before me but ended things with her when she wanted more. *This man says he wants more than anything to meet the person, settle down, and have kids.* I cannot emphasize that enough. Is a self described “non lovey dovey” type of guy. 

Our relationship: 
- we met working together nearly 3 years ago. We were very close colleagues/friends and I caught feelings quickly. People around us said we should date and would be perfect for each other. Due to age gap and our careers he claims he never viewed me that way, but hearing about his online dates and loneliness triggered my volatility. So he saw that in patterns before we even got together (embarrassing). I finally confessed feelings and he rejected me, so I gave up. 

- 1-2 months later he asks me to hangout and he went full swing ahead wanting to date me. I happily agreed, but my AP attachment wound got triggered easily especially because of past rejection. We also hid it from everyone we worked with out of fear of judgment etc due to high pace medical environment. He broke up with me maybe 2 months later, which was fair. We continued being friendly colleagues. And with time the awkward/tension diffused. 

- 2 months after 1st breakup he tells me he wants to meet and talk about our relationship , then he said nothing else about it for a week or two. I pressed him on this and it pushed him away. So the cycle ran it’s course yet again. We continued working together etc etc same as before. 

- 2 months later he invites me over - now it’s valentines weekend - and he has flowers waiting for me with desserts. And we begin a casual fling that would last 3-4 months, much smoother this time. I met his parents for dinner, we went camping one weekend. Immediately following these 2 events I had an insecure dream/moment and it pushed him away. He claimed me meeting his parents was like “introducing them to a friend” and he went away with me for that weekend “because he knew I wanted to go and just needed someone to do it with”…ouch lol. 

- Okay, our time of working 2.5 years together was coming to an end but we unfortunately were moving to exact same city afterwards. I always thought we would be much better together if we weren’t in that stressful workplace environment 24/7. Our last night before I made the move first I slept over at his and he was telling me how beautiful I was, smelling my forehead, etc. the next morning it was like that never happened. So I made the move and had my final anxious spiral, where he once again rejected me and said “he understands how it can be confusing and he regrets doing it for that reason, but it was tying that chapter in a bow.” I went no contact and sought therapy…which is when I started to heal 🫶🏼 

- 3-4 weeks into NC, he emails me about about work related things that have followed us both after moving and asking if we’re still not texting. I texted him about work and it spiraled from there. 2 weeks later we were hanging out and he was now beginning the next year of residency. Our work schedules were much different in this new city together. His sucked/sucks. His only free days were after he worked 24 hour shifts, so I’d go over in late afternoon and have cooked up a nice homemade dinner. And we would hangout for 5 hours or so and then go to bed. Our dynamic in new city was so much better. We had minimal digital contact and I only saw him once a week on those post call days, it didn’t trigger me I was very proud. I thought things were going great. His new roommate met me and told my ex “she’s not and cooks for you, you need to lock that down.” My ex told me this and how it made him happy to hear. Then we had a very small disagreement that he agreed I handled maturely, quickly, not hyper-emotionally even tho he thought it was petty/stupid. 1 week later he tells me his grandma died 4 days ago (he never told me? I justified it as grief). And then a few days after that he ends things with me saying he doesn’t feel a romantic spark, sees me as a little sister, and believes we are incompatible longterm. Via phone call. After ~2 years of close friendship and ~1 year of an on/off dynamic…I was shocked. I asked lots of questions, he was sure to admit that his busy schedule had nothing to do with it. His roommate telling him to lock me down apparently changed from making him happy to making him feel guilty. He said I’m immature and dramatic when I tell stories and I enjoy “pop culture” too much. I handled the call very well which he admitted he didn’t expect. Yay therapy. This final “on” period lasted 6 weeks ish total. But he says he felt himself losing feelings the final 1-2 weeks, or so he claims. 

Anyways it sucks to have had this happen when I was finally working through my anxieties in romantic relationships and loving the healthy space. He said he felt our effort and investment was imbalanced - which it was - because his schedule is terrible. But I already know him so well, I didn’t feel I needed a coffee date. He said I  felt like an obligation, but I wasn’t demanding anything of him. I was letting him seek me out/text me, which came every 2-3 days. No sweat. Now I’m wondering if I was missing obvious signs but justifying them by blaming his work schedule or grief. 

I’m happy I can at least hold my head high knowing that overt volatility was finally *not* the demise of my relationship. I never demanded, never asked for more/wanted more , I was genuinely content. But because I was SO blindsided thinking things were going swimmingly lol, my mind has been in a tailspin trying to figure out…am I delusional? Did I imagine a romantic connection that could have potential for long term? How could he & I have such different realities? And worst of all…what went wrong/what happened? I genuinely feel a little embarrassed and crazy for how well I thought I was going…🤣

I’m open to any & all thoughts. Thanks again if you made it this far 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼",1,1755573432.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Like yelling, stomping, doors slamming.

Except… it wasn’t a movie. It was my upstairs neighbors.

At first, I tried to ignore it. Apartment life, you know? But then I heard the guy yell, *“Fine, then tell him the truth yourself!”* and immediately I muted my TV. 👀

The girlfriend is yelling back, “I never even wanted HIM in the first place!” Then more stomping, a crash (sounded like a chair tipped over), and I’m just sitting there wide-eyed on my couch like… do I call the cops or grab popcorn?

Then, and I swear this is true, another voice joined in. A THIRD voice. Male. Calm. Low. Like he’d been sitting there the whole time. He goes, *“This isn’t about me. This is about you lying to yourself.”*

Y’ALL. I CHOKED. There was a THIRD MAN??

Suddenly everything went dead silent for like thirty seconds. Then doors slam again, footsteps down the stairs, and the boyfriend storms out of the building with a duffel bag. Tires screech, car speeds off.

I thought that was it… but nope.

About twenty minutes later, I hear soft music playing upstairs. Then laughter. Then footsteps. Then… well, let’s just say the ceiling fan above my bed was shaking like it was trying to file for workers comp. 😳

Fast forward to this morning: I’m leaving for work, and who do I see casually sipping coffee on the balcony? The GIRLFRIEND… and Mr. Calm Third Voice.

But wait, there’s more.

As I’m unlocking my car, guess who pulls back into the parking lot? The BOYFRIEND. Holding flowers.

I don’t know how this season is going to end, but I already know I’ll be watching from the front row.

*UPDATE (same day, 6PM):* Came home from work and all three of them were outside talking. I couldn’t hear the words, but the body language looked… tense.

1mu6z25,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1mu6z25/just_another_late_night_until_it_wasnt_part_7/,Just another late night... until it wasn't. (part 7),"The beam of the flashlight was blinding. For a moment, I couldn't see anything but the harsh white light searing into my retinas. Then, a figure resolved itself out of the darkness, a silhouette against the backdrop of flashing blue and red. The young officer, his face tight with authority, kept his weapon trained on me. ""On the ground! Now!"" His voice was firm, leaving no room for argument.

My muscles felt stiff and unresponsive, but the ingrained instinct for self-preservation took over. I lowered myself to the damp asphalt, the cold seeping through my thin shirt. My hands remained raised, palms open, a gesture of surrender that felt utterly alien to the horrifying truth churning inside me. Another officer approached, his footsteps crunching on loose gravel. He moved with a practiced efficiency, quickly securing my wrists with metal handcuffs. The cold snap of the lock was a stark reminder of my current reality – no longer a hunter uncovering a nightmare, but the hunted, caught in a mundane act of lawbreaking.

""What's going on here, Officer Miller?"" the second officer asked, his gaze sweeping over me and then towards the boarded-up back door of the bar. ""Found this one trying to sneak out the back,"" Miller replied, his eyes still fixed on me. ""The door was jimmied. Looks like a possible B and E."" Breaking. That's all they saw. A petty crime, a foolish mistake. The irony was a bitter taste in my mouth. If they only knew what I knew, what I had seen…

""You got any ID on you?"" Miller asked, his tone shifting slightly, less aggressive now that I was subdued. My mind raced. What name would come out if I tried to speak? Would it be a name that felt familiar, or another phantom echo of a stolen life? The Grand Canyon mug. The wrench. David Collins. None of it made sense within the confines of this alleyway, under the scrutiny of these officers. ""No,"" I managed, my voice raspy, unfamiliar even to my ears. ""I… I don't have any."" The two officers exchanged a look. Suspicion flickered in their eyes, a step up from simple apprehension. A nameless man caught breaking into a closed business in the dead of night. It wasn't adding up to a simple case of vandalism.

""Alright,"" Miller said, his gaze hardening again. ""Let's get you back to the squad car. We can sort this out downtown."" As they hauled me to my feet, the flashing lights painting the alley in dizzying streaks of color, I glanced back at the darkened silhouette of ""The Last Call."" The truth remained locked inside its boarded-up walls, a silent witness to a horror these officers couldn't even begin to imagine. And I, the unwilling inheritor of that horror, was now in their custody, my real crime undetected, my terrifying secret safe… for now.

The silence in the back of the squad car was louder than the sirens had been. It was the oppressive, humming silence of a contained space, broken only by the low crackle of the police radio and the steady drip of rain against the window. I sat with my hands cuffed behind my back, the metal biting into my wrists. The cuffs were a physical representation of my new reality, a harsh contrast to the horrifying truth that was screaming in my mind. I was a man who had murdered someone, an identity-stealing monster, and yet here I was, being treated like a petty thief. The absurdity of it all was almost comical, a twisted punchline to a joke I didn’t understand. I looked out the window at the passing streetlights, their glow painting the interior of the car in fleeting, ghostly flashes. The world outside looked so normal, so indifferent. Did the people in the houses we passed know? Did they have any idea of the horrors that lurked in the mundane, that a man in a stolen life could be driving right past them?

My thoughts spiraled, circling back to the security footage. The figure that was me, but wasn't. The way our faces had seemed to merge on the grainy screen, a horrifying, seamless transition. That was the moment my sanity had truly shattered. It wasn't just a memory; it was a testament to what I had become. The fear that had been a dull throb in my gut was now a cold, physical presence, wrapping itself around my chest and squeezing. The squad car pulled into a brightly lit parking lot. A sign with the seal of a local police department loomed over us. The police station. A place where criminals were processed, where truths were uncovered, where lies were exposed. But what about a truth so bizarre, so impossible, that it would sound like the ramblings of a madman?

Inside, the station was a sterile, unforgiving landscape of beige walls and fluorescent lights. I was led down a long corridor that smelled of stale coffee and disinfectant. The officer who had found me, Miller, spoke with a bored dispatcher as he wrote up the report. I was just another number, another case to be closed.

They sat me down at a metal desk, and a female officer with a no-nonsense bun of hair held up my right hand to a small digital scanner. The cold glass of the scanner was unnerving against my skin. She pressed my index finger down, then my middle finger. I saw a live feed of the scan on a monitor beside her. There was nothing. Just a smooth, featureless surface.

The officer scowled, tapping the machine. ""Try again,"" she said, her voice sharp with annoyance. ""Press harder.""

This time, she grabbed my hand with more force. As she pressed my thumb firmly against the glass, I felt a strange, tingling sensation, like a dozen tiny needles were pricking the pad of my finger. My mind screamed in silent protest, but I couldn't pull away. It was as if my body was no longer under my control. I saw the monitor change. A pattern, intricate and swirling, materialized out of the static. It was a fingerprint.

The same cold, prickly feeling spread to my other fingers as she pressed each one in turn. Every time, the patterns formed as my flesh was pressed to the cold glass. They weren't my fingerprints—they were the fingerprints of the man I had seen on the security footage.

I looked at my hands, my flesh, my knuckles and veins, and knew that they were now marked with the identity of another man. The horror of it was a cold, nauseating pit in my stomach. The officer, oblivious to my terror, simply grunted in satisfaction. ""There. Finally working.""

They took my photo—a standard mug shot, a blank-faced man with lost eyes. The camera flash was a jarring punctuation to my disorientation. I saw my reflection in the dark glass of the scanner, and for the first time, I truly saw myself. The face was my own, the one I had woken up with, but under the unblinking light of the police station, it was no longer just a face. It was the terrifying proof of my connection to David Collins, and to his murder. It was my face, but it was the face of a killer, and it felt like a stranger's.

""Name?"" The booking officer asked, not looking up from his computer. My throat felt thick. I had to choose. I could tell him the name I had woken up with, the one on the driver's license in my pocket. Or… what? David Collins? The thought of saying his name out loud, of claiming his identity in this sterile room, was a new kind of horror. It felt like an act of finality, of accepting what I was. ""Alixx,"" I whispered. ""Last name?"" he continued, his tone impatient. A single thought, as sharp as a blade, pierced the fog in my mind. This is who you are now. ""Black,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Alixx Black."" The officer looked up, his brow furrowed, a faint hint of surprise on his face. This wasn't a simple case of breaking anymore. This was something else. Something more complicated, more confusing. ""Alright, Alixx Black,"" the booking officer muttered, typing on his keyboard. ""We'll get you a Public Defender. You'll be held in a cell until your hearing."" The booking officer finished typing, then stood up, nodding toward the door. ""Detective Riley wants to have a word with you.""

The cold of the booking room gave way to the even colder air of the interrogation room. I was led down another sterile hallway, the steel door clanging shut behind me once more, this time with a hollow finality. The room was a monument to clinical detachment: a small metal table bolted to the floor, two chairs, and a single, unblinking overhead light that cast a harsh glare, illuminating every speck of dust in the stagnant air. On one wall, a dark, reflective glass panel told me I was being watched.

I sat down, my hands still cuffed behind my back, a pointless precaution now that I was locked in a concrete box. My mind, which had been a whirlwind of panic, felt strangely still. It was the calm before a storm, a quiet that was more terrifying than any scream. I knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that this was where my truth would finally collide with their reality.

The door opened, and a woman walked in. She was tall, with a weary face and a well-worn suit that seemed to have been through more than her fair share of late nights. She didn't carry a weapon or a notepad, just a Styrofoam cup of coffee. She pulled a chair out, turned it around, and sat down facing me, her arms resting on the back of the chair. She took a long sip of her coffee, her gaze never leaving me. ""Alixx Black,"" she said, her voice a low, gravelly hum. ""My name is Detective Riley. We're going to have a chat.""

I didn't respond. I just stared at her, my mind trying to reconcile this calm, tired woman with the monstrous memory I was carrying. ""So, Alixx,"" she continued, leaning forward slightly, ""you were found breaking into a bar called 'The Last Call.' The owner, a man named David Collins, died there almost **three years ago**. It's an open case, but we have a pretty good idea of what happened. He was killed by a robber who got away with the night's earnings.""

Her words were a carefully placed trap, a calm recounting of a tragedy that felt like a lifetime ago. A simple case of robbery and murder. They didn't know the truth. They couldn't. ""I didn't break in,"" I said, the words feeling foreign and clumsy. ""The door was unlocked.""

Riley's expression didn't change. She simply nodded, taking another sip of her coffee. ""The door was jimmied, Alixx. We have evidence of forced entry.""

She was lying. I knew it. The key under the mat, the smooth, effortless turn of the lock—my mind, the one that had been there before, knew that the break-in was a lie. The police had wanted to question me and had concocted this story. But why?

""We got a call about a suspicious person,"" Riley said, as if reading my mind. ""The neighbor. They saw you enter the building."" The lies were a thin veil, meant to cover a deeper, more chilling reality.

""I didn't hurt anyone,"" I whispered, the words a plea to an unseen audience.

Riley smiled, a slow, weary expression that didn't reach her eyes. ""We know you didn't. We have security footage of the whole thing. The murder, I mean. It happened **three years ago**. We've had a copy of the tape for a while now."" A jolt of pure, unadulterated terror shot through me. My mind reeled. They had the footage. They had seen it all—the wrench, the brutal blows, the horrifying transformation. They knew.

""And,"" Riley continued, setting her coffee cup on the table with a soft click, ""we know you didn't do it. The man in the video, the one who murdered David Collins... he was a perfect copy of David Collins. His face on a new body."" I stared at her, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird. This was it. The moment of truth. My secret is no longer my own.

""So, here's my question, Alixx,"" Riley said, her voice dropping to a low, intense whisper. ""Why did you go back to the scene of a murder that has nothing to do with you?"" The woman's eyes were fixed on mine, not with suspicion, but with a cold, terrifying curiosity. And for the first time, I realized my mistake. They didn't know everything. Not yet. They had found the real Alixx, the one from my memory, the one they were hunting. And I, the blank slate, the amnesiac victim of a monster I had no memory of being, had just given myself away.

The words hung in the stale air of the interrogation room, cold and final. I stared at Riley, my mind reeling. My lips parted, but no sound came out. The truth was an impossible scream trapped in my throat, a scream no one would believe. I saw the logic of it all, the terrifying, impossible case the police had built. They had a motive, they had a suspect—a ghost who appeared on camera and disappeared just as quickly. They had the murder weapon, wiped clean of its original owner’s prints, and now they had the fingerprints of the man they had been hunting. **David's** fingerprints.

Riley watched me, her gaze unblinking. The hint of pity on her face was gone, replaced by the grim determination of a detective who had just cracked a cold case.

""The B and E was just an excuse, Alixx,"" she said, her voice dropping the pretense of conversation. ""We've been looking for you since the David Collins case went cold. We knew we weren't looking for a normal man. We were looking for a person who could walk out of a crime scene, leaving behind the identity of the victim.""

She leaned forward, her elbows on the table. ""You're a careful man, Alixx,"" she said, ""You're trying to figure out what we know, trying to build your story. But you're missing the key piece of information. The murder weapon. The wrench. We found it, Alixx. Weeks ago. It was wiped clean, hidden behind some pipes in the basement of the bar.""

My heart hammered against my ribs, but she wasn't done.

""And now, we have the prints of the man who left it there. A set of prints our system just identified a few hours ago,"" she finished, her gaze fixed on me, knowing full well the implication of her words. ""The prints on that wrench are an exact match for David Collins. His prints are on the murder weapon, and we have security footage of a man who is a perfect copy of him running from the scene. The paradox is that the man we have in custody, who foolishly came back to the crime scene, is you. So, Alixx... what were you doing there?""

I looked at the calm woman sitting across from me, and then at the dark, reflective glass of the two-way mirror. I was in a nightmare, a silent movie where my body was performing a terrible role that my mind refused to acknowledge. They had all the pieces of the puzzle, but they were all wrong. The man they were looking for was dead. The man they had was an unwilling inheritor of his crimes. The absurdity of it all was overwhelming. My body, my hands, my face—they all pointed to a story I couldn’t begin to tell.

I stared at the space between us, unable to meet her gaze, unable to speak a single word. My silence was my only defense, a blank slate of an answer for a lie that was now my life.

They sat me down at a metal desk, and a female officer with a no-nonsense bun of hair held up my right hand to a small digital scanner. The cold glass of the scanner was unnerving against my skin. She pressed my index finger down, then my middle finger. I saw a live feed of the scan on a monitor beside her. There was nothing. Just a smooth, featureless surface.

The officer scowled, tapping the machine. ""Try again,"" she said, her voice sharp with annoyance. ""Press harder.""

This time, she grabbed my hand with more force. As she pressed my thumb firmly against the glass, I felt a strange, tingling sensation, like a dozen tiny needles were pricking the pad of my finger. My mind screamed in silent protest, but I couldn't pull away. It was as if my body was no longer under my control. I saw the monitor change. A pattern, intricate and swirling, materialized out of the static. It was a fingerprint.

The same cold, prickly feeling spread to my other fingers as she pressed each one in turn. Every time, the patterns formed as my flesh was pressed to the cold glass. They weren't my fingerprints—they were the fingerprints of the man I had seen on the security footage.

I looked at my hands, my flesh, my knuckles and veins, and knew that they were now marked with the identity of another man. The horror of it was a cold, nauseating pit in my stomach. The officer, oblivious to my terror, simply grunted in satisfaction. ""There. Finally working.""

They took my photo—a standard mug shot, a blank-faced man with lost eyes. The camera flash was a jarring punctuation to my disorientation. I saw my reflection in the dark glass of the scanner, and for the first time, I truly saw myself. The face was my own, the one I had woken up with, but under the unblinking light of the police station, it was no longer just a face. It was the terrifying proof of my connection to David Collins, and to his murder. It was my face, but it was the face of a killer, and it felt like a stranger's.

""Name?"" The booking officer asked, not looking up from his computer. My throat felt thick. I had to choose. I could tell him the name I had woken up with, the one on the driver's license in my pocket. Or… what? David Collins? The thought of saying his name out loud, of claiming his identity in this sterile room, was a new kind of horror. It felt like an act of finality, of accepting what I was. ""Alixx,"" I whispered. ""Last name?"" he continued, his tone impatient. A single thought, as sharp as a blade, pierced the fog in my mind. This is who you are now. ""Black,"" I said, my voice steady. ""Alixx Black."" The officer looked up, his brow furrowed, a faint hint of surprise on his face. This wasn't a simple case of breaking anymore. This was something else. Something more complicated, more confusing. ""Alright, Alixx Black,"" the booking officer muttered, typing on his keyboard. ""We'll get you a Public Defender. You'll be held in a cell until your hearing."" The booking officer finished typing, then stood up, nodding toward the door. ""Detective Riley wants to have a word with you.""

The cold of the booking room gave way to the even colder air of the interrogation room. I was led down another sterile hallway, the steel door clanging shut behind me once more, this time with a hollow finality. The room was a monument to clinical detachment: a small metal table bolted to the floor, two chairs, and a single, unblinking overhead light that cast a harsh glare, illuminating every speck of dust in the stagnant air. On one wall, a dark, reflective glass panel told me I was being watched.

I sat down, my hands still cuffed behind my back, a pointless precaution now that I was locked in a concrete box. My mind, which had been a whirlwind of panic, felt strangely still. It was the calm before a storm, a quiet that was more terrifying than any scream. I knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that this was where my truth would finally collide with their reality.

The door opened, and a woman walked in. She was tall, with a weary face and a well-worn suit that seemed to have been through more than her fair share of late nights. She didn't carry a weapon or a notepad, just a Styrofoam cup of coffee. She pulled a chair out, turned it around, and sat down facing me, her arms resting on the back of the chair. She took a long sip of her coffee, her gaze never leaving me. ""Alixx Black,"" she said, her voice a low, gravelly hum. ""My name is Detective Riley. We're going to have a chat.""

I didn't respond. I just stared at her, my mind trying to reconcile this calm, tired woman with the monstrous memory I was carrying. ""So, Alixx,"" she continued, leaning forward slightly, ""you were found breaking into a bar called 'The Last Call.' The owner, a man named David Collins, died there almost three years ago. It's an open case, but we have a pretty good idea of what happened. He was killed by a robber who got away with the night's earnings.""

Her words were a carefully placed trap, a calm recounting of a tragedy that felt like a lifetime ago. A simple case of robbery and murder. They didn't know the truth. They couldn't. ""I didn't break in,"" I said, the words feeling foreign and clumsy. ""The door was unlocked.""

Riley's expression didn't change. She simply nodded, taking another sip of her coffee. ""The door was jimmied, Alixx. We have evidence of forced entry.""

She was lying. I knew it. The key under the mat, the smooth, effortless turn of the lock—my mind, the one that had been there before, knew that the break-in was a lie. The police had wanted to question me and had concocted this story. But why?

""We got a call about a suspicious person,"" Riley said, as if reading my mind. ""The neighbor. They saw you enter the building."" The lies were a thin veil, meant to cover a deeper, more chilling reality.

""I didn't hurt anyone,"" I whispered, the words a plea to an unseen audience.

Riley smiled, a slow, weary expression that didn't reach her eyes. ""We know you didn't. We have security footage of the whole thing. The murder, I mean. It happened **three years ago**. We've had a copy of the tape for a while now."" A jolt of pure, unadulterated terror shot through me. My mind reeled. They had the footage. They had seen it all—the wrench, the brutal blows, the horrifying transformation. They knew.

""And,"" Riley continued, setting her coffee cup on the table with a soft click, ""we know you didn't do it. The man in the video, the one who murdered David Collins... he was a perfect copy of David Collins. His face on a new body."" I stared at her, my heart pounding against my ribs like a trapped bird. This was it. The moment of truth. My secret is no longer my own.

""So, here's my question, Alixx,"" Riley said, her voice dropping to a low, intense whisper. ""Why did you go back to the scene of a murder that has nothing to do with you?"" The woman's eyes were fixed on mine, not with suspicion, but with a cold, terrifying curiosity. And for the first time, I realized my mistake. They didn't know everything. Not yet. They had found the real Alixx, the one from my memory, the one they were hunting. And I, the blank slate, the amnesiac victim of a monster I had no memory of being, had just given myself away.

The words hung in the stale air of the interrogation room, cold and final. I stared at Riley, my mind reeling. My lips parted, but no sound came out. The truth was an impossible scream trapped in my throat, a scream no one would believe. I saw the logic of it all, the terrifying, impossible case the police had built. They had a motive, they had a suspect—a ghost who appeared on camera and disappeared just as quickly. They had the murder weapon, wiped clean of its original owner’s prints, and now they had the fingerprints of the man they had been hunting. **David's** fingerprints.

Riley watched me, her gaze unblinking. The hint of pity on her face was gone, replaced by the grim determination of a detective who had just cracked a cold case.

""The B and E was just an excuse, Alixx,"" she said, her voice dropping the pretense of conversation. ""We've been looking for you since the David Collins case went cold. We knew we weren't looking for a normal man. We were looking for a person who could walk out of a crime scene, leaving behind the identity of the victim.""

I just discovered this subreddit tonight and I thought I'd give this a shot. I experienced that thing I think most people do in their mid 30s where everyone moves in opposite directions and before you know it there's either no one left nearby or no one left that shares your interests.

  
I'm looking for anyone that's either near my age or willing to hang out with an old lady like myself to do nerdy things around the city. Like:  


\- **Karaoke!!!** Anyone that enjoys JPOP including 2000s idols or Anime music or Broadway. I am happy to go either way. There's a new Broadway themed choir that started in the city that I'd love to visit.

\- Themed Cafes - Literally anything themed I'll try out once. I also love a fancy high tea moment and would be happy to try out new places.

\- Anime/Gaming Events - I go to Toronto Comic Con, Anime North and Fan Expo every year and would love to go to more. Soundtrack concerts are also a favourite of mine, I'd also love to see more movies or event screenings.

\- Books - Do you like manga or romance novels and just want a coffee and browse buddy? I can do that! I collect Shojo, Josei and BL titles as well as have a huge stack of contemporary and fantasy romance novels in my library at home.

\- Japanese - Are you studying Japanese and want a study buddy? I studied for years and have my JLPT N1 but would like to retake the exam to challenge myself to relearn a lot of things I've forgotten. Regardless of level if you want study advice or a judgement-free place to practice I'd be happy to help.

\- I am a pretty nervous person. I will not flake when I make plans but I might be high strung. I promise I act normal once I get to know people.

I began fasting as a way to help me reduce some medical concerns; prediabetes and high blood pressure. 

Before IF I made massive diet changes, cut carbs significantly but continued on grazing throughout the day. Sadly I didn't see my numbers change. So I did some reading saw some of y'alls journeys here, and I got motivated to start. 

After only 5 months of 18:6 I was no longer pre-diabetic and out of hypertension 1. But my energy levels were P O O R, especially during my eating window. I did a lot of reading about OMAD and saw it can help, so I bit the bullet and worked up to it over a couple months. 

Now officially at the end of one month of OMAD, I feel like I have insane energy levels during my fasting window. I get pretty sleepy right after eating (siesta time), but I feel amazing during fasting. It's really helped me at the gym and to shed a couple of those extra stubborn pounds. 

I wanted to share in case anyone else had thought about it.

I try to aim myself in a window of about 90-140 g protien, 60-75g fats, and 90-140 g carbs. I always have a fiber supplement + protien shake as my last source of food, I've found I stay satiated well into the next day that way, regardless of what I ate beforehand. 

When I get peckish before my eating window I make myself a cup of coffee and chase iy with a big water+electrictrolytes and walk or hit the gym. 

The full weight journey has been from 258 lbs (~32% body fat) to 204 (~20% body fat) in a little under 8 months now. With a significant amount of fat loss during my OMAD start up. (I am in a deficit; not in body recomp). This has been assisted with 1 hours resistance training 5 days a week and 10k steps daily. 

After being a life long weight lifter and suddenly seeing the fat come off I thought I'd be stuck with forever, I'm happy to have jumped into OMAD. Especially after believing all day grazing was the way to go. Now im here to keep my A1C and BP in the green.

*August 19, 2025 — A Game Where the Runs Might Flow Like a K-Cup Coffee Spill*

The KBO’s latest grudge match pits the **Samsung Lions** against the **NC Dinos** in a clash that’s as evenly matched as a tug-of-war between two overcooked hot dogs. Let’s parse the odds, digest the (fabricated but plausible) news, and crown a winner with the grace of a toddler wearing a tiara.

---

### Parse the Odds: A Statistical Tango

The betting lines scream “*yawn*” at first glance. Every bookmaker on the planet has this as a near-tossup. At Bovada, both teams sit at **1.87** on the moneyline, implying a **53.47% chance** for either squad to win. The spreads? NC Dinos are favored by **-1.5 runs** (with odds of +285), while Samsung sits at **+1.5 runs (-140)**. The totals? A pedestrian **8.5 runs**, with “Over” and “Under” odds hovering around **1.85-1.95**.

Translation: This game is a statistical stalemate. The only thing more balanced than these odds is a Korean barbecue plate loaded with kimchi, bulgogi, and enough side dishes to feed a small army.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Shenanigans, and One Tripped-Up Ace

Let’s spice things up with some *fictional* team updates:

* **Samsung Lions**: Their star right-hander, **Jung Hoon “The Human Torpedo” Park**, is sidelined after “suffering a mysterious injury during a team-building exercise involving trust falls and a malfunctioning karaoke machine.” Sources say he tripped over his own shoelaces mid-performance of “Gangnam Style,” leading to a strained ego (and possibly a hamstring). Backup pitcher **Lee Doobie** will start, though his nickname—“The Wild Coffee Shot”—should raise eyebrows.
* **NC Dinos**: They’ve leaned into their bullpen, which is “so deep, they could host a submarine base.” Closer **Kang “The Wall” Min-Jae** has a 98-mph fastball and the demeanor of a man who’s seen too many Samsung fanatics jeer his family. Oh, and th

I would strongly encourage everyone impacted by return to office (read: return to Downtown Toronto) to do the same. Let’s let the people in power know that the Toronto economy is not the provincial economy!

“Dear Mayor Scarpitti,

I am writing to you not only as a resident of Markham but also as a committed employee of the Ontario Public Service (OPS), to express my concern about Premier Doug Ford’s recent mandate requiring OPS employees to return to the office in Toronto full time.

This decision poses significant challenges for many of us living in Markham. Beyond the increased cost, stress, and time associated with the commute, this change will have a direct economic impact on our city. As someone who has been working in a hybrid capacity, I have consistently supported local businesses, whether it’s grabbing coffee at a local café, shopping in town, or spending on services throughout the workweek. I have had more time with my family to spend time in Markham.

However, returning to the office in Toronto full time means that much of my weekday discretionary spending meals, transit costs, daily purchases will be redirected away from Markham and into Toronto. This shift takes dollars out of our local economy and away from the small businesses that rely on the daily presence and spending of residents who work remotely or hybrid.

Additionally, the hybrid model has proven effective in maintaining productivity, morale, and work-life balance. Moving away from that model not only affects our quality of life but also risks undermining the vibrancy and growth Markham has built by attracting professionals who now face a difficult choice: endure this new burden or relocate closer to Toronto.

I respectfully urge you to advocate on behalf of residents/ taxpayers and raise this issue with the provincial government. A more balanced, flexible work policy would better support both the effectiveness of the OPS and the economic health of communities like ours.

Thank you for your time and for your ongoing commitment to the people of Markham. 

Sincerely, X",18,1755571782.0,Markham,8,0.75,False

BTW, I currently have only 6 chapters of this, but they are moderately lengthy, I guess🤷🏽‍♂️😆

""An Agent Of Protection"" by T. A. Ortiz

An Agent of Protection

Chapter One: False Dawn

It was a cool, crisp morning, as the sun had barely begun to spread its dawning light. ""Hey! Morning, sunshine. You look like a bed of roses. Look, Vincent, I don't know why you have Mr. Richard calling my damn phone, but he said he's gonna need you to bring that dumper back to the yard, pronto!""

The coffee hadn't kicked in yet, and the weariness of my night persisted into the dawning. I slowly turned my head to look with a blank stare, as if to say, dude, I'm not fucking up yet. I calmly said, ""Jody, it's too early, my man, and why the fuck didn't he go to Miguel with this shit yesterday? I already told Richard he doesn't pay me enough for all I got to do around here. My coffee hasn't even cranked its shafts, for crying out loud!""

Jody laughed after my outburst. ""Well, don't shoot the messenger, my friend. How about that, huh? I'm already stressed with how much white gold we're gonna be pouring today. You said twenty, I said potentially twenty-five yards or so. With this much work, we better be getting that bonus! I could use a vacation. I don't want to spend the rest of my life working harder than the heat in the Sahara.""

I laughed at our usual shenanigans and Jody's uplifting sense of humor, though he knew exactly where I was coming from this early in the morning. ""Where are the goddamn keys for that piece of shit? Can you grab them from inside the office? Shit, they're not, are they?"" I gave the last of my morning energy to the final outburst.

Jody looked at me with a smirk and said, ""I'm so sorry to bother you, my love, but I think Richard has all the keys to our equipment, if I'm not mistaken. So, unfortunately, you're gonna have to go take your ass to get the keys from our dear, beloved boss, and I'll be here to support you, sweetie, from a distance!"" He laughed as if he was at a stand-up comedy show. His laugh was infectious in light of his antics toward my obvious frustrations.

I could do nothing but glare at him and his antics this early; it was the norm for him to try and get under my skin. Laughing, Jody chuckled and continued winding a cable that was used for heavy lifting and pulling. I said, ""You know, Jody, sometimes, I just want to do the opposite to your mouth what you're doing to that cable and just unwind your winding tongue."" He smiled and gave me a few slow, catlike blinks, further demonstrating his ability to tickle me with his annoyance.
Suddenly, my phone began to buzz.

""Mention the devil and they call. Thanks, Jody,"" I said, while he pretended not to hear a word of what I had said. Mischievously, Jody abruptly stopped for a second and turned to face me. He said, ""It makes sense now why he refers to you as 'Vince Allstate'—because he knows he can call you and he'd always be in good hands."" Jody then smirked at me as if to say, how's that feel, again?

""Richard, good morning, sir. Yeah, boss, I'm aware. Look, I just pulled up at the office, and we've got about 20 trucks or so coming in. Well, yeah, only Jody and a few of the other guys are here with me now. The rest haven't shown up yet. Yeah, we should start around 8:30. I guess they've got a little bit more time before we head out, though. So you don't want Miguel or Tony taking the dumper? It's not like you can tell me, boss. Yeah, yeah. Alright, I know... okay, boss, I got it. I'll see you there when I'm done.""

On the other end of the line, Tristifus Richard, or just Richard as the rest of the crew called him, was just about ready to grab me through the phone and tear me a new asshole. Though my composure was calm and collected in front of Jody, he didn't know Tristifus like I did. As a matter of fact, he had no idea what we did in its entirety. He believed the construction we did here and there was it. Mind you, it was very substantial, the amount of contracted construction gigs we got. A credible means to an end. Oh well, he was an honest dude at the end of the day, and I respected the hell out of him for that.

Chapter Two: The Mask of Labor

Dropping the cable on top of a pallet, Jody dusted off his clothes, looked at me, and asked, ""What did he say?"" I told him that his boss was pretty insistent on me carrying the dump to the north yard.

""Why would he want you to carry it all the way to the north yard, though?"" Jody continued. ""The south yard is what, fifteen minutes from here? And Miguel's lazy ass would probably be the best bet to do some lame ass shit like that, right? I don't even understand why we gotta go all the way up there just to get fuel, too. I hate that bumpy ass road back there. It would make more sense to carry it there, that's all I'm saying."" 

Jody was talking a little too much and asking too many questions. It felt like a game of Marco Polo.

""Look, he's the boss. I don't question him too much as long as he's willing to make sure he writes my checks out for the right amount."" Jody laughed and said he definitely agreed with that, finally withdrawing from his interrogative thoughts.

We were scheduled to pour a massive entranceway that day. Before I could, however, I first had to go and take care of a particular task that I fronted as if someone else could have undertaken. Unbeknownst to Jody, I had spare keys for everything that had a lock that belonged to us. Sheds, lockers, equipment, you name it—and even the doors that can't be seen unless you knew where to look.

""Jody, make sure all the tools are on the truck. Make sure you have everything ready to sign off when we get through at the end of the day. When the rest of the guys get here, take them and head on out to the site. The concrete should start showing up roughly around eight.

Double-check and make sure everything's in place. I don't want any fuck-ups with this one. I'm gonna go take the dumper to the yard as our boss requested of me. You know I got a lot of faith in you, Jody.""

I began walking off towards the parked truck. Observant Jody noted as I tried to creep off without giving any more rise to his inquisitive nature. Caught like an escaped prisoner in the glare of the guard tower's spotlight, Jody said, ""But wait, boss, I thought you had to get the keys from Richard, though. You plan on hot-wiring the thing?"" He chuckled as usual, hiding the fact that he was genuinely asking.

I could only smile as I mentally noted why I needed to keep Jody at a fair distance. ""I was actually thinking about that!"" I laughed. ""No, I just remembered that Richard gave me a spare for the truck the last time he worked on it. Thank goodness, though, it saves my ass from definitively ruining the rest of my morning,"" I said, chuckling it off to further appease his humorous side. 

As I signed off with him and turned my back once again, heading towards the truck, I could feel his inquisitive stare trying to deduce me as if I was some walking, unknown puzzle to him.

1mu6ghr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NevilleGoddard/comments/1mu6ghr/technique_series_visualization_the_definitive/,Technique Series: Visualization - The Definitive Guide,"Welcome to the first part of a new series focused on the ""how."" We've talked about the philosophy; now let's talk about the tools. We're starting with the most famous, most powerful, and most misunderstood of them all: Visualization.

Most people give up on visualization because they believe they're failing. They can't ""see"" anything, they get bored, or they try too hard. This guide will demolish those myths and turn visualization into your most reliable tool.

1. The Great Myths (What Visualization is NOT)

Before you learn how to do it right, you have to unlearn what's wrong.

Myth 1: ""It has to be as vivid as a 4K movie.""
FALSE. This is the mistake that stops 90% of people. Visualization is not about visual clarity. The goal is not to ""see,"" it is to ""experience."" A vague feeling, a blurry impression, or a simple ""knowing"" that you are in the scene is a thousand times more powerful than an HD image with no feeling.

Myth 2: ""I can't visualize, I'm not a visual person.""
FALSE. Visualization is not limited to sight. It's about the imaginal senses. Can you imagine the sound of a loved one's voice? The feeling of sand in your hands? The smell of coffee? If you can do that, you can visualize. The feeling is the secret, not the sight.

Myth 3: ""I have to do it for hours.""
FALSE. Quality over quantity. A short, 5-10 second scene, charged with feeling and looped until it feels real, is infinitely more effective than a one-hour movie in your mind that leaves you drained.

2. The Tutorial: How to Visualize Correctly (The Simple Method)

The process is simple. First, you create your scene, then you enter the right state to impress it.

Step 1: Define the End Scene.
Do not visualize the ""how."" Choose a short scene that implies your desire is already fulfilled.

For a Relationship: Don't visualize the first date. Visualize a friend congratulating you on your anniversary, or the feeling of your partner's head resting on your chest.

For Money: Don't visualize how you earn it. Visualize opening your banking app and seeing the desired balance, feeling the wave of relief and freedom.

For a Job: Don't visualize the interview. Visualize yourself sitting at your new desk, taking a sip of coffee, and feeling a sense of satisfaction.

Step 2: Go First-Person and Engage the Senses.
You must be inside the scene, looking through your own eyes. Ask yourself:

What do I physically feel? (The warmth of a hand, the phone in your palm, the texture of the desk).

What do I hear? (The words of congratulations, a specific sound in the room).

What do I emotionally feel? (Relief, gratitude, joy, peace, security).
This emotional feeling is the goal. It is the signature you are impressing upon your subconscious.

Step 3: Enter the State to Impress (Meditation & SATS).
You don't visualize with a busy, active mind. You must enter a relaxed, receptive state first.

Meditation: Before you begin, take 5-10 minutes to meditate. Simply sit or lie down, close your eyes, and focus on your breathing. Relax your body from your toes to your head. This quiets the conscious mind and opens the door to the subconscious.

SATS (State Akin To Sleep): This is the most powerful time to visualize. As you are lying in bed about to fall asleep, your mind is naturally in a drowsy, trance-like state. This is the ""sweet spot"" where the subconscious is most receptive.

Step 4: Loop the Scene.
Once you are in that relaxed, meditative, or SATS state, bring up your short, first-person scene. Play it over and over, like a GIF in your mind. Don't force it. Gently loop it until it begins to feel natural and generates the desired emotional feeling. If you're doing this in SATS, continue looping until you fall asleep in the feeling of the wish fulfilled.

3. The Do's and Don'ts (The Quick Guide)

DO:

Keep your scene short and loop it.

Focus on the FEELING of the wish fulfilled.

Visualize from a 1st-person perspective.

Choose a scene that IMPLIES the end result is already a fact.

Relax and enjoy the process; it should feel like a pleasant daydream.

Drop it afterwards and trust that the seed has been planted.

DON'T:

Don't create a long, complicated movie.

Don't obsess over visual clarity or ""getting it perfect.""

Don't watch yourself from the outside (3rd-person).

Don't visualize the ""how"" or the process of getting your desire.

Don't turn it into a chore or a stressful effort.

Don't keep ""checking"" the 3D world for results after your session.

Conclusion:

Stop treating visualization like an art exam you have to pass. It is a playground. It is the act of briefly visiting your future so you can feel it in your present. The feeling is the secret. The feeling is the prayer that is always answered. Now go and build your house.",3,1755571200.0,NevilleGoddard,1,0.8,False

It’s not about pretending you have the thing. 

It’s about treating what you do have NOW like it’s already enough.

Because if you really believed your dream life was on its way, or already unfolding, or already here!! you would be obsessed with the present. You would be in love with life right now! You would be happy! kind! excited! full of love!!!!!

But no one wants to do this.
Because it’s simple!!! but not easy.
It means slowing down. Feeling. Being grateful. 

it doesn’t mean pretend your soulmate is next to you.

it doesn’t mean act like you’re rich when you’re broke.

it means:
live like what you have now is everything you ever wanted. wow! you are living a dream!!!

so try this:

look at your life, the bed you sleep in, the sky, the coffee, the quiet.

and decide that this is it. this is the life you dreamed of.

romanticise the tiniest things!!!!
 
and let that energy spill into your body like sunlight.

be thankful! be kind! share love! 

this is the cheat code to manifesting! 

that’s what makes you magnetic.

1mu69qh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mu69qh,NEW R3BEL CRT Delta Skin for N64 complete with REFLECTIVE BEZELS and OVERSCAN! For Bluetooth Controllers on iPhone!,"**\[R3BEL CRT GAMEPAD\]** for Bluetooth Controllers on iPhone  [Download \[R3BEL CRT GAMEPAD\] for N64 Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ctg5TGxvwZkvBMFASFpk3KLMhRTs6maS?usp=share_link)

***\*\* Highly Recommended to read through the*** [“READ ME” file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wDBp0r4CumA-YiCDGMq5xeIacXcNaCzY/view?usp=share_link) ***through this link. It thoroughly explains the details of these skins and also has a list of recommendations for which skin to use for specific games. \*\****

Another version of the CRT Series for N64 on iPhone. They’re finally ready with iPad and MacOS versions coming soon! These N64 skins are some of my most complex skins to date! They are CRT style skins that use Core Image Filters to distort the game screen to create a bubble style screen similar to the old CRT televisions. They also feature a reflective bezel, mirroring the game image on the inner edges of the screen bezel. They are definitely not perfect CRT's, but seeing that Delta does not support actual third party shaders this is the closest I could get.

**RELEASE NOTES:**

1. The CRT GAMEPAD versions have no control sets which are intended for use with bluetooth controllers such as a DualShock, Backbone, etc.  
2. Only supports edge-To-Edge iPhones (phones with no home button) 

**OVERSCAN & PER GAME RECOMMENDATIONS** 

***\*\**** *These skins have only been tested and designed for the NTSC / US Rom files. Using Other / PAL formats may or may not look as expected.****\*\****

**What is Overscan? -** Overscan on a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) television is a display setting where the image is intentionally zoomed in, causing the edges of the picture to be cut off and not visible on the screen. This was a common practice on older CRT/Tube TVs. 

**Delta N64 Emulator Overscan -** N64 games were designed by game developers to be played on CRT displays which causes some games to have black bars or borders that show on the game emulators like Delta. 

* These skins with “Overscan 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0” are designed to simulate the same behavior to help hide those bars and give a more authentic play experience. 
* Each of these skins have different levels of cropping applied to the game screen image. With “no overscan” being as implied, no cropping at all. While “overscan 3.0” has the most cropping in from the edges. 
* Please see the second image in this post for a comparison of Banjo Kazooie with No Overscan skin vs the Overscan 2.0 skin. 
* *If you have any requests for specific games to crop out the black borders that these do not work for. Please let me know.*  

As always, feedback is always welcome. Good, bad, or ugly. all is welcome ;)

1mu691m,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1mu691m/daily_headache_and_naproxen/,Daily headache and naproxen,"For the past few weeks, I’ve been having daily headaches. But maybe I should start from the beginning. I’ve had headaches for many years. At one point it was so bad that I went to see my GP. He advised me to stop drinking coffee and tea. That helped for a while—I only had headaches a few times a month (related to my menstrual cycle i guess). Unfortunately, the headaches came back.

For over a month now, I’ve had a headache almost every day. I tried to find some reason or trigger, but I have no idea what it could be. Most often the headache appeared around noon. Sometimes I had already eaten something, and sometimes not. Its nothing strange, i usually dont eat breakfast. Recently, for a short while, I thought things were getting better, because even when the headache started, it sometimes went away without taking a pill. Occasionally I took painkillers, but the headache would still be there at bedtime. I went to sleep with a headache, woke up with a headache, but after getting up it would go away after a while.

At one point, I thought maybe it was an issue with my contact lenses. My glasses broke, so I got a prescription for cntact lenses. But I’m not sure that’s the cause, because firstly, I wore contact lenses in the past and never had these problems; secondly, during the first month of wearing them I didn’t have these symptoms; and thirdly, I don’t wear them on weekends, yet my head still hurts.

Additionally, the last two days have been terrible. As usual, the headache started in the afternoon, but this time it didn’t go away despite painkillers. The next day I woke up with a headache, and unfortunately it didn’t stop all day despite taking 2 × 2 paracetamol and 2 × 2 ibuprofen.

So here’s my question. The GP prescribed me naproxen, to take one tablet three times a day for a month. But when I read the leaflet, I saw that it’s not a typical headache medicine. Also, I’m concerned about the dosage—three times a day for a whole month? So far I’ve only taken one tablet. The headache didn’t go away after it, and I just felt really groggy.",2,1755570609.0,migraine,3,1.0,False

I’ve been with Starbucks for almost a year, and it’s been okay. I don’t hate my job… but it’s also not me. I don’t feel like myself at work. I’m just going through the motions. I got this job because I love coffee, and I have good customer service experience. But my love for coffee is being killed, and every time I hear the ‘ping’ of the drive thru I flinch. It’s not the company I started working for, and the hustle culture of this company and American workplaces in general is really disheartening to me. My personal philosophy is that patience is key, and most things in the developed world are not so important that they need to happen immediately. So when I live in a world where people can’t wait 45 seconds for a cup of coffee, and I have to coach people on that, a bit of me dies with every order. It’s just so. Inconsequential. 

I went to college for music, and worked in the theatre industry for a while, and taught for a bit, but the work is just so unstable. If I left Starbucks, I couldn’t afford my apartment, let alone afford to take risks like traveling or doing the whole LA/NY thing. I am making good money and living an okay life, but I just feel numb and unfulfilled. Should I leave? How would I go about starting anew?

So, There is this guy(I’m a guy to and he’s gay as well) I met about 5-6 months ago and we just kind of met organically because we have mutual hobbies mtg nerd type stuff etc, but we just kind of hit it off and legitimately became closer. It was rough because I caught feelings very early and express my interest and was met with “it’s something I’m not looking for, but I want to be friends” and so we stayed friend this was maybe a month in. Fast forward to last week which is maybe month 4 or 5 of our friendship, and I went to grab a coffee with him and awkwardly stumbled through my feelings for him and how it’s weird for me. I was met with a very similar response like the first time. I honestly don’t know how I should feel about it because for the first time in my love life I met someone organically, and not on the internet and just saw myself become more and more interested in this individual and loving every aspect of what makes them well them. So I’ve reached a hard impasse because I keep going to them because they enrich my life and make me feel good, but I get kind of beat down internally because it makes me feel inadequate because I’m just good enough for this level and not anything else ya know.

I am a very introverted and shy person and haven't dated for years. I haven't had much interest, but about three years ago I met a guy at work. For whatever reason, I was drawn to him, and it annoyed me to no extent. We rarely see each other and even more rarely communicate, but he is constantly in my thoughts, infuriating me as it is very unlike me. When I first met him, I was going through a very dark period, which only got worse. My mental health reached breaking point, and I needed an intervention. After a lot of work, I got better, slowly, but I did. I let go of situations and people and so much of my old self, but the one thing I cannot seem to let go of is this guy. 

As hard as I tried, I am not able to get over him. I would try to think about anything else, but he still literally haunts my thoughts and emotions in a very romantic way, and it makes me feel hurt. As I started getting better, about a year and a half ago, I did ask him if we could meet for a coffee just so I could at least communicate with him outside of the workspace and figure out why I was feeling what I was. I do not know this guy, and I assumed that since I have just built him up in my head, once I just speak to him outside of the workplace, I can start to move past him. However, he turned me down by basically not responding and changing the topic. I have never had any idea about his relationship status and don't follow anyone from work on social media. 

I have always known, and still do, that him and I will never happen. I still cannot stop being hung up on him and need some advice on how to move past someone. It is also very unlike me, and I feel stupid for having these feelings for someone I don't even know. I have tried looking for other jobs and have been open to dating even, but neither has worked out. It is a very frustrating experience, especially since I will go weeks without ever even seeing him, but the thoughts persist and always romantic. 

Is there any sort of therapy or exercise that can help me move past this? I have been recommended to date someone, but there has been no progress there either. I would really appreciate any guidance on this issue. ",1,1755570029.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
