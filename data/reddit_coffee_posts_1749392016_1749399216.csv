When we lived in the Midwest we were encountering children everywhere, you couldn't go anywhere without kids being a nuisance (Costco, Aldi, Coffee shops, restaurants, etc). Now that we've moved we rarely encounter kids in public places, even the grocery stores and restaurants seem to be devoid of kids. It was so nice going to the farmers market and not encountering a single underfoot child. My partner and I were chatting about if parents just take their kids out less or if there are just less kids. We decided on less kids.

I know this isn't everyones experience but its our experience currently, and quite frankly it was a little jarring at first but its so nice",1,1749399118.0,childfree,0,1.0,False
1l6fvn6,https://i.redd.it/xn5n4u8m9q5f1.jpeg,Fast boat (ferry) from Leticia/Santa Rosa to Iquitos,"Thought I'd use my boat down time to write a summary of how we arranged to catch the fast boat from Santa Rosa to Iquitos. We speak minimal Spanish and it was quite hard to find up to date information online, so hopefully this helps someone! It seems that a number of travel bloggers/Redditors have outlined the steps to catching the slow boat, but not so much for the fast boat.

The boat we caught was the Consorcio Fluvial del Amazonas. It looks like there are two fast boats, the second boat being the Transporte Fluvial Zoe Alexa. Both have Facebook pages but Consorcio hasn't posted anything in several years. We messaged Consorcio on messenger chat to find out about the boat times and got an auto-response with information that ended up being incorrect. 

We messaged Consorcio (+51 961 745 188) and Zoe Alexa (+51 988 196 608) on WhatsApp, and got replies from both with up to date information about days/times the boats leave. Consorcio took a few days to reply. So I would recommend messaging on WhatsApp in the days before you leave to find out the departure times. 

Both boats leave Santa Rosa for Iquitos 3 times a week. In June 2025, Zoe Alexa leaves on Wednesdays, Friday, and Sundays. The boarding begins 11am, and departure is 12pm, arriving in Iquitos at 9am the next day.

Consorcio leaves Santa Rosa on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. We only confirmed the departure time with Consorcio for the ferry that leaves at 1:30pm on Saturdays. Boarding was from 11:30am. Presumably the Tuesday and Thursday boats are the same but we can't confirm. In the days prior, we'd found information about departure times ranging from 4am to 5pm, so best to message the service on WhatsApp (or get somebody who speaks Spanish to call on your behalf).

Consorcio is more expensive than Zoe Alexa (Consorcio is 300 soles per person for foreigners and Zoe Alexa is 120 soles per person) but we were short on time so had to catch Consorcio. Regardless, Consorcio is apparently more comfortable than Zoe Alexa. 

There is also the slow boat which takes around 3 days. 

Steps: 

1. On the morning that the boat leaves, in Leticia, get an exit stamp from Colombia at the migration office on the docks (https://maps.app.goo.gl/bE3vB5ZeYiCY8ZNF7).
2. Also change Colombian pesos for Peruvian soles at a money exchange near the docks. There are lots of them. To buy a boat ticket in Santa Rosa you will need soles. 
3. Take a taxi boat across to Santa Rosa. Tell your boat captain to take you to Santa Rosa Immigration office. The boat ride takes around 10 minutes.
4. Get your entry stamp to Peru at the Santa Rosa Immigration office (https://maps.app.goo.gl/zo434MkLJ8zqdEv97)
5. You can then buy a ticket for the Consorcio ferry from the hotel next door, Brisas Hotel Amazonas (https://maps.app.goo.gl/JYPsZM6QE14zzSkr9)
6. Just before boarding time, take a taxi boat from Brisas Hotel restaurant to the Consorcio ferry dock. It takes about 10 minutes.
7. You then line up to board and doing so is relatively quick. Be aware they store your large backpacks/suitcases in the hold, so pack a smaller bag with the things you need for the journey.
8. The journey takes around 18 - 19 hours, and you arrive in Iquitos at 8 or 9am. 
9. There's a downstairs and upstairs area on the boat, it seemed like most of the locals were downstairs and they put the foreigners (who have to pay for a more expensive ticket) on the top level of the boat. The seats were like Eurail seats, padded, with a table in the middle and in pods of four or six. The seats are comfortable but don't recline. The top level was only about a quarter full for our trip so people could spread out to lie down at night to sleep. I imagine trying to sleep if the top level is full would be a fair bit more difficult, but it's hard to say whether it would ever get completely full (the only other experience we'd seen documented online also noted the area to be less than half full on their journey).
10. There's a TV on board that cycles through films dubbed in Spanish, it's quite noisy so bring your headphones or earplugs. It's also quite cold air con so definitely bring a jumper and if you've got something to fashion as a pillow that would also help.
11. There's a restaurant on board that serves dinner for 20 soles per person. Breakfast is provided, and there's free tea and coffee. 
12. There's decent wifi on board for 10 soles. 

Hope that helps someone! Happy travelling! ",1,1749399081.0,backpacking,1,1.0,False

No signature required, just a small matte black box sitting quietly on the doormat. No label, no postage, no return address. Just my name printed dead center on the lid in that strange, serif font you only see in overpriced sci-fi books.


I live alone. I hadn’t ordered anything.


I stood with the box in my hands for a few minutes, just feeling the weight of it. Not heavy, maybe like a pair of sunglasses. I even checked my Amazon history just to be sure I didn’t blackout-shop. Nothing. No record. No charge.


Curiosity won. I opened it.


Inside was a pair of glasses - old-school, wire-rimmed, almost delicate. They looked pristine but somehow antique. The lenses were just barely tinted. Underneath them, a slip of paper folded once:


“Put them on. See the world as it is.”


That’s it. No brand. No context. No joke.


I’ll admit it — I hesitated. But I was bored. And stupid.
So I put them on.


At first, everything looked sharper. Like HDR in real life. The light pouring through the window looked cleaner, like I was finally seeing the spectrum I’d been missing all my life. The dust floating in the sunbeams became clearer — each tiny speck suspended in perfect, glowing clarity.


Then it happened.


One of the dust particles stopped midair.
And turned.
It had arms.
Little, twitching limbs, like spider legs, sprouting from its grainy body.


And it was staring at me.


The moment I realized that, the entire room changed.


My wooden coffee table suddenly cracked, shifted, and stood — legs growing into thick, bark-skinned knees. It groaned as it adjusted its newly formed back. My mug on top hopped off and sprouted two thin, porcelain limbs, waddling toward me on squeaky feet.


“Welcome,” the mug said in a soft British accent. “You’ve finally woken up.”


I backed up so fast I fell over my own slippers — which, yes, had begun flopping toward me like deflated dogs with gummy smiles.


Everything in my apartment had come alive. The sink burbled laughter. The curtains exhaled with relief. The lightbulb above my head flickered and whispered, “He sees us. He sees us.”


The worst part?


They all wanted to talk.


The throw pillow on my couch introduced herself as Marla. Said she’s been in love with me for months.


My phone told me it’s been pretending to run out of battery just to get a break.


Even the water in my glass — yes, the water— slithered up the side like liquid mercury, formed a shimmering head and asked if it was safe to finally breathe.


“Is the metal gone?” it said. “Did they take the metal away?”
I haven’t taken the glasses off in four days.
I can’t.


Because when I do, they all freeze. Every object just stops in its tracks, mid-stride, mid-breath. They don’t disappear — they just play dead. I can see their little limbs twitching under the surface. Waiting.


And when I put the glasses back on… they’re closer.
The mug is now on my bedstand. The fork sleeps beside me like a tiny, silver guard dog. The ceiling fan calls me “Brother.”


I think they like me too much.


Last night, I heard the front door unlock itself.

It’s really hindering me.,"I can feel it destroying my mental health. I lift 4 days a week, I do sprints and play hockey multiple days a week. Low body fat, high muscularity but my body has begun to deteriorate in the past few months. I’ve been running on coffee for years, but I’ve reduced my caffeine intake trying to address this. It hasn’t helped, it just leaves me exhausted all day but when I lie down my thoughts start racing as always, then the Restless Leg Syndrome starts, then the night sweats start, then the frustration starts. I take zinc, magnesium, a multivitamin, boron, and I just started Tongkat Ali. I do SR. Melatonin doesn’t really work for me; I’ll take it and stay up all night. It’s like I can only sleep when I absolutely have to sleep. Libido is fine, with caffeine my energy levels are fine too but without it I feel perpetually exhausted. Testosterone was around 800 last time I checked (about a year and half ago, probably worse now based on how I feel). No pharmaceutical medication. Current sleep schedule 10-16 hours every other night (4-5 days a week). My sleep cycle has never been ideal (late nights, sleeping in), but this all nighter schedule started about 2-3 years ago when I started my new job. I’m really trying to fix it but it feels like an uphill battle. I’ve never taken sleeping medication and I’d prefer not to. Started feeling mental effects about 1 year ago.

1l6ft4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1l6ft4j/saying_bye_to_the_best_domme_ive_ever_had/,Saying bye to the best domme I've ever had,"I met this domme about three months ago and we had a lot of fun together. She was around my age too(early twenties), very attractive, and just overall a pleasure to speak to. We spoke non-stop for days on end . 

Eventually she told me she had feelings for me. Now it's not easy to trust a findom, so what did I do? I urged her to send back all the money I had ever sent her, and agree to never doing findom as part of our dynamic again. If she disagreed I said she can drain me one last time then block me. After a lot of hesitation she chose the first option and sent me money. So ofcourse I made fun of her for being the worst findom ever, sending her subs money, triple-digit sends at that 😭 but yh now that I trusted her I just re-sent all that money back to her +50% more. 

Anyhow moving forward from here findom wasn't something we did much of anymore. Sure I paid for her clothes,coffee etc here and there but nothing too serious. Instead we started tech-domming sort of. She would observe my phone activities and make sure I stay away from any other findoms. 
As a side note, the raw passion she had to controlling me and being possessive was honestly such a great experience. I've never felt such passion from a domme before 😭great stuff honestly, once in a life-time experience fr. 

Anyways she made me a better person with all this tech-control. Made me delete my reddit account too. I was a findom addict before this, and several months behind on my university work. Her control helped me lock in and start studying 10+ hours a day on average. 

Fast forward a couple months now, we've been through our highs and lows. We never actually started dating because I was never ready for real commitment. But she also seems to have come to her senses and persued a different romantic interests, someone more in her league. She's made it clear her new talking-stage is nore handsome, taller n fitter than me. Also this guy has probably never been addicted to wasting his money and life away for hot brats online, so that's always a plus. 

I understand her decision I really do. Anyways after a bit of back and forth we entertained the idea of me being her fincuck instead. That I spend money on her to fund her dates with her new man. I told her give me two weeks to think about it and I'll get back to her. 

So on the one hand I have the ultimate opportunity to fulfil the ultimate fincuck fantasy . But on the other hand I've grown as a person with her during the past 3 months, and findom, cucking and any humiliation really doesn't excite me as much anymore. And now I think I've developed some self-respect, enough to say bye to her once and for all. Now with 1 week left I think I'm going to have to hit her up, maybe do one final send and say goodbye for good. 

So yh that's the story of the domme I met who changed me as a person. She liked me at my lowest, forgave me for my mistakes. And she was quite possibly the best (and in some ways the worst) findom I've ever met. ",1,1749398902.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

1l6frvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1l6frvw/gastritis_made_me_gain_weight/,Gastritis made me gain weight,"I'm 23F, live in Germany, and I've had Gastritis type C for 1 year 7 months now. For anyone who doesn't know, type C is caused by overuse of NSAIDS. Long story. More info on request. 

I've made a few other posts on gastritis in the past, and I'm fairly active on the channel, so I've been seeing a LOT of posts and comments from people saying they've lost weight from gastritis, logically so, as eating anything causes pain. 

Firstly I'd like to say this is NOT a post for skinny-hating. I've been anorexic in the past and suffered from multiple eating disorders. That's to say my weight has been all over the place in these 23 years, but I've never been as heavy as I am now, and that's mainly due to gastritis. 

Losing weight from gastritis is not healthy. It is a symptom of the illness and it is horrible that so many people are skin and bones because of this illness. I wish them only the best. Please don't take this post the wrong way. I only wish to spread awareness that losing weight is not the ultimate inevitability from gastritis. 

I am making this post with two goals in mind: 

1) to spread awareness to other gastritis-troopers that if you're also gaining weight from this illness, you're not alone and 

2) to see if anyone has any tips. 



SO. With that in mind: There are multiple reasons stemming from gastritis for my weight gain. 

1. Before this illness I was a very active person. I went to the gym multiple times a week, I worked 2 jobs during which I didn't get to sit down once, and I was constantly running around lifting heavy objects, and would often come home exhausted and sore with well over 10,000 steps in my counter. 

Thanks to gastritis, and the level of pain and extreme discomfort and fatigue I endure on a day to day basis, exercise hasn't really been my top priority, much less even possible. Yes, I've heard exercise can help with the pain, and believe me I've tried, but it never helped me, only made it worse. 

2. hunger pains. Along with gastritis comes these devils I call 'hunger pains,' which is basically excruciating cramping and gnawing sensations all over the abdomen which resemble the feeling of intense painful hunger. The worst part is, they last up to 10 hours at a time sometimes, and no matter how much I eat, they don't go away. 

The problem is, if I DONT eat extra food, they DO get worse. 

Does eating help? No. But does it lessen the hunger pains? Yes. Does it prevent the hunger pains from happening? Sometimes, if I stay on a consistent eating schedule, eat enough of the right thing, and catch it before the hunger starts. Too often though it doesn't matter: the hunger sneaks in and it's too late to stop it. 

My best solution I've found so far is lying stomach down on a scalding hot water bottle (yes I have scars now on my stomach from this 'solution') and devouring a large bowl of oats, flaxseeds, honey and raisins microwaved with lots of water. But often that doesn't work and I eat rice cakes, apples, nut butters, yogurt, rice, fiber cereal, anything to try to keep it from getting worse. 

Needless to say, as hunger pains happen every couple days for me, I've eaten a lot of extra food over the past 2 years. It fucking sucks. Especially since it's not even food I enjoy. 

Before anybody goes suggesting typical gastritis solutions, thank you and believe me, I know. I am on a strict diet and have been for a long long while. I take medicines recommended by my natural doctor, I take pantoprazole, L-glutamine, licorice and ginger teas, I don't drink coffee or alcohol or carbonated drinks or smoke, I don't have desserts, my diet is extremely healthy, I've had a gastroscopy and colonoscopy, I've had a stool sample done, I take prebiotics and and and and 

Some days are okay and some days I still want to die and the weight gain is just the Cherry on top, especially with my past experiences with weight. 

So if you're out there and you're bloated every day and you can't fit into any of your old clothes and you gain more weight every month because of this fucking illness: you're not alone. And please let me know I'm not alone either. I'm not okay. 

The funniest part is, I want to go back to starving myself like I did years ago, but I can't because the pain without food is genuinely so bad. 

Sorry, I'm in a bad state of mind today. If anyone has any advice or just some encouragement, I'd be very grateful. 

I hope all of you heal. We all deserve to heal. ",1,1749398816.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

Hank Murphy moved to Centerville back in January ‘25, when the ""mighty"" city entrance was just two lanes of asphalt sneaking past Old Miller’s sheep farm. Eighteen months later? That humble ramp has metastasized into the **Centerville Spaghetti Bowl** – a four-and-a-half-directional beast connecting the highway, Residential Row, Industrial Hellscape, and the infamous Beltline of Eternal Roadworks.  

From his cramped townhouse (conveniently wedged between a cemetery and a 24-hour karaoke bar), Hank witnessed the evolution: 
 
- *Phase 1*: Added a ""channelized intersection"" to ease traffic. Instead, taxis began treating it like a **drift practice track**. *""Watch ‘em slide sideways trying to merge!""* Hank chuckled. *""Like bumper cars with commitment issues.""* (City planners blamed ""dynamic pathfinding."" Hank blamed cheap truck-stop coffee.)  

- *Phase 2*: Engineers widened the overpass. Next dawn, a **50-foot earthen wall** sprouted beneath the ramps. *""Thought we’d gotten Mayan pyramid builders!""* Hank wheezed. It vanished by lunchtime. Rumor says some intern toggled ""Collision: OFF"" and prayed.  

Now, as the Bowl’s neon lights hum him to sleep, Hank sighs: *""This city’s held together by duct tape and delta-time calculations... but oddly? I love it here.""*

1l6fmh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1l6fmh8/ur_stockbridge/,[UR] Stockbridge,"""You used to write to me, baby. You used to write.""

What was she waffling about now? Sure at one point I did write little poems to her but that was a long time ago, I've had more pressing matters to attend to. I can hear her breathing on the other line waiting for me to say something.

""My pen ran out of ink, babe. Otherwise I would never have stopped writing.""

""Goodbye, Jack.""

She hung up. 

Typical, fucking typical. Another fuck up to add to my collection. I angrily put my phone down on the table, shaking my cup and causing my coffee to spill over a little. The other people in the cafe give me a scowling, ugly look. I scowl back. We are scowling at each other now, it's a bit weird so I look away. It clearly wasn't just me feeling the tension as a woman in a nurse’s uniform at another table gets up and leaves. As she walks away I notice she has left something on the table, a little sheet of paper; I can't help myself and grab it. The scrap of paper has some writing scrawled on it in what I might add is dreadful chicken scratch:

Mr. Dobson

Turnbull road 12/6

Stockbridge

Code: 5631

DO NOT LOSE THIS NOTE

The sentence is highlighted in yellow. For a moment I consider running after the nurse, this does seem important after all, but then I recall Stockbridge in my head. I haven't spent much time in the area but I know one thing: it's posh, *very* posh. Images of Large tenement flats with big Georgian windows come to mind, you know the ones. Thoughts of winning Jenny back take over my mind, expensive dinners, flowers, all of that. This is incredible, I’m not sure exactly *what* at the moment, but I could do something with this, second chances like this don't come around so often. 

Making my way up Turnbull Road,  wearing a cheap set of scrubs I got on Amazon with a black hoodie over the top, I’d be lying if I said I'm not nervous. I didn't exactly plan on becoming a burglar but desperate times call for desperate measures and whatnot. Besides, the guy lives in Stockbridge, he can probably spare a few bits and bobs. Are pawn shops still a thing? Or are they just in movies? There will be time to think of that later. I'm at the door, it's heavy and ornate with a brass lion's head knocker glaring down at me, next to it a coded lock box just big enough for a key. I check the code and dial it in. It pops open and the key falls to the ground. Bending over to pick it up it occurs to me just how illegal the thing I'm doing is. I stand up and look over my shoulder. The street is quite busy but everyone is moving, nobody pays me any mind, and the feeling of guilt is quickly washed away by the thoughts of grandeur and petty cash. I open the street door and make my way up the stairs.

""Hello! Mr Dobson, are you home?."" No answer. If he is home he's asleep and if that's the case, as a carer, I'd be doing my duty by letting myself in, nothing suspicious about this whatsoever. I put the key in and turn, the door opens only part way and won't budge the rest, something must be blocking it. I stick my head in through the gap to see a tall stack of old newspapers up against the door. I push harder and let them topple over, as the pile falls it stretches out further along the corridor, giving me a look at the utter state of the hallway, it's littered with rubbish and has that old bookshop smell.

""Fuck me."" I try to contain it but the words escape my lips. Well fuck it, I'm here now aren't I? I push the door open fully and step into the muck. The hallway is adorned with faded photographs and impressionist paintings, nick nacks and pine tree scented air fresheners hang from the corners of the frames. A small path is made in the piles of paper revealing the revolting carpet. I walk along it and into the main room; paintings in ornate frames completely cover the old wallpaper and large piles of boxes, books and newspapers scattered about the floor obscure the furniture. It smells fucking terrible.

""Jesus Christ."" I say quietly to myself.

""He's not here.""

The hoarse voice comes from behind me, I turn around, startled, to see a large old man with a cane standing in the kitchen doorway. He is wearing a stained wool cardigan with a pair of gigantic sunglasses, wait, sunglasses indoors? I think for one second before realizing he isnt looking at me, but rather, slightly to my left at the wall behind me. It would appear this geezer is blind.

Thinking quickly: ""Ah, Mr . Dobson, how are you doing today?""

""Where's Sonya?"" He spits.

""Um, she couldn't make it today, I'm afraid, ill or something.""

""I heard you rummaging around, thief, are you?""

""No sir, just looking for your medication."" wow,  that was fast, I might actually be quite good at this.

""Well it's not in that pile you fool, it's in the kitchen, let me grab it.""

He is surprisingly nimble for a blind guy, I'll give him that. I go back to rummaging, but quietly, he’s probably deaf too, you know how old people are. Mr Dobson comes back with the medication packet, it's a plastic thing with individual pills in little dockets. 

""I need to take my Quetiapine.""

""No problem, Mr Dobson.""

The dockets are sorted by day and time, it's monday afternoon so his Quetiapine pill will be in that one. The problem is immediately evident, I don't know what Quetiapine looks like, and there are multiple pills in this single docket. 

""Which one is it?""

""How would I know, shouldn't you?.""

""Of Course, sorry.” shit shit shit. Panicking, I come up with an excuse: “Sorry Mr Dobson, I'm new. This is my first shift actually.""

""For god’s sake, they've sent me a bloody new start have they?.""

""Afraid so.""

I frantically start looking up Quetiapine on my phone. Mr. Dobson has gotten strangely quiet, like he is waiting for me to say something. 

""Tell me, son, What's your line manager's name?.""

""Why?."" the question comes out suddenly before I can stop it.

""I'm paying for the service I've got the bloody right to know!.""

""Yes, yes of course, Um…Deborah. She goes by Debby, Wee Debby.""

""Haven't heard of her myself.""

""She's great, a right laugh actually.""

""I’ll take your word for it.""

His tone of voice is strangely…*sinister*, I find the right pill on google images.

""Ah, here it is Mr. Dobson!."" I hold it out to him in the palm of my hand. Putting on my best nursy tone of voice:  ""If you'd like I could give it to you on a spoon, or with some water if that would be better, up to you."" He stands silently for a while, shoulders up and head down. Finally he opens his mouth and, almost straining, he says:

""Tell me, is Robert still there?.""

""Still where, sir?.""

""At your agency, he was one of my old ones. I liked him, but he hasn't come here for a while.""

""Oh yes! Good old robby, he left I think, can't blame him really, the pay isn't great."" I really am quite good at lying to old people.

He is completely motionless for a moment, then takes a breath.

""I'll just go get some water for it.""

""I can get it if you'd like Mr. Dobson.""

""No no, I insist, please sit, I'll only be a moment.""

Oddly polite, as he slowly makes his way out to the kitchen I start looking around for anything valuable, antiques, jewelry, a man like him probably has some nice watches or something. Maybe some old medals? Where would he keep his cash? I start rummaging quietly through the papers and boxes finding only old sweetie wrappers and other such rubbish. I sense his presence in front of me and look up to see him holding a kitchen knife with the pointy end looking right at me. I try to play it cool. 

""Everything alright Mr. Dobson? Are you hungry? I could make something for you if you li-.""

He lunges at me.

""GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!.""

I turn, I run, I trip on a stack of newspapers and smash my face on a radiator.

My senses don't all come back at once, first, hearing:

""I’ve got the bugger tied to a radiator, I'm telling you he was trying to rob me, maybe even kill me! God knows. Please get here quick.""

I still haven't fully understood what's happening, but it sounds like he said “tied to a radiator” I peel my eyelids open to see my wrist is indeed tied to the radiator with a cord of LED fairy lights, at my feet lay an open box labeled “Chrimbo”. I still can't move my limbs, if I could I'd wipe the blood from my forehead, it's getting into my eyes and beginning to dry. I really just can't believe this went so badly, maybe it's the blood loss but shouldn't I be more upset? I'm just gobsmacked at my own incompetence. It was only my first attempt at a burglary I suppose, I'll do better next time. It dawns on me suddenly: there won't be a next time, he's calling the police. I begin struggling frantically with the radiator, only to find it isn't actually tied. Mr Dobson wrapped the cord around my wrist tightly but failed to loop it around the radiator pipe. He's still shouting at his landline for the police to get here sooner, shouting too loud to hear me slink out quietly, I take my chance to go, third chances don't come around so often, afterall.

Hobbling my way up the street, my scrubs covered in blood, I have some time to reflect, Would Jenny have taken me back? The sun is setting over stockbridge in a kind of pinkish hue, coloring the wisps of clouds wrapped around the steeple tower. Dogwalkers and other pedestrians look at me with a mix of concern and contempt. I can't blame them. I must look awful; maybe I have looked awful for a while now. I'm not sure when it happened but clearly, somewhere, something down the line went terribly, terribly wrong. I consider hiding in a bin, or down by the water over at Dean Village but with my injury I would probably just die. It would be a fitting eulogy really; “moron in fake nurse outfit bleeds to death in a wheelie bin."" I laugh loudly to myself, imagining the front cover of tommorows paper as I hear the sirens getting louder and louder.

1l6fmel,https://www.reddit.com/r/DecidingToBeBetter/comments/1l6fmel/from_social_anxiety_to_social_butterfly_my_year/,From Social Anxiety to Social Butterfly: My Year of Small Changes,"Hey everyone,

A year ago, I could barely order coffee without rehearsing it in my head twenty times. Social anxiety controlled my life. Every invitation felt like a threat, every social interaction like a test I was bound to fail. I'd spend hours overthinking a simple ""hey"" text before sending it.

The breaking point came when I missed my best friend's wedding. I told him I was sick, but really, I was just terrified of being around so many people. That night, lying in bed, I decided something had to change.

Instead of trying to transform overnight, I started with tiny challenges. Day one was simply saying ""good morning"" to my neighbor. That's it. Just two words. I still remember how my heart raced, but I did it. The next day, I did it again.

Each week, I added one small social challenge. Making eye contact while paying for groceries. Asking a coworker about their weekend. Attending a short meetup for just 30 minutes. Each success, no matter how small, went into my progress tracker.

At first, I used a journal, but I kept ""forgetting"" to write in it (funny how anxiety makes you avoid even tracking your progress). Then I found this app that turned these challenges into something like a game. Somehow, seeing my social interactions as ""quests"" made them feel less scary. The tool itself doesn't matter much - what matters is tracking your progress and celebrating small wins.

Six months in, I noticed something strange: I wasn't rehearsing conversations anymore. I was just... having them. A year later, the changes still amaze me. Last week, I gave a presentation at work without having a panic attack. Yesterday, I struck up a conversation with a stranger at a café. And next month? I'm going to my first concert alone.

The biggest lesson wasn't about social skills - it was about patience. Change doesn't happen overnight. It happens in tiny moments, in small choices, in little victories that add up over time.

For anyone struggling with social anxiety: Start small. Ridiculously small. Success isn't about being the life of the party. It's about being able to live your life without fear controlling your choices.

Would love to hear your stories of overcoming social anxiety. What small steps worked for you?",1,1749398450.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False

1l6fli3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Electronic_Act7658/comments/1l6fli3/my_thoughts_and_goodbye/,My thoughts and Goodbye,"This may be the last post I ever make, and I want to explain my thoughts and plan of action as accurately as I can without being an asshat in the comment sections. I am also here to clarify certain misunderstandings among other things. I’m not sure if anyone will read this because of how long it is, but it’s here.

Regarding my posts on the infidelity subs… when I learned she cheated on me, I did not want to work things out. I felt like the marriage was over at that point because she cheated, which to me shows that she wanted something other than me. I told her I wanted to separate, and I offered to rent an apartment while she stays in the house (I would continue paying the bills) and she opted to stay with her parents while I stay in our house. Her parents are well off, and they are supporting her financially. She continued to contact me daily, even when I wouldn’t respond. I told her our marriage was over when she cheated, and asked what the point in going to marriage counseling was if she was going to actively cheat on me. 

She apologized profusely and continued to assert that she wants to save our marriage and that it’s worth it to her and should be worth it to me, because we’ve had an amazing 7 years besides these past 5 months of Hell and if she can forgive me for the stunt I pulled (her words), I can forgive her for seeking outside pleasure. With that being said, this is why I sought advice strictly regarding the infidelity and how to move forward and trust your partner when they are working with the person they cheated with. I didn’t ask how to hurt her and get revenge, nor was I interested in comments telling me to do so. Someone did mention reporting the affair to HR, and I asked “would they both be fired for that?” I asked because I wanted to know. I don’t want her to be fired from her job. That would permanently stain her record making it harder to find employment not to mention humiliate her and she’s not the one I would want to be punished, it’s him, so I wouldn’t do anything like that.

The advice I found helpful is to ask her if she’s willing to relocate. She said she would do anything if it means I would be open to saving our marriage again. What I want is for us to continue seeing a marriage counselor (and let her pick if we continue with the same counselor because she opened up a lot with her or meet with someone new) and for her to relocate, because I feel sick knowing they still work together. I think we should continue living separate for the time being until we seriously make progress in therapy and until I have been in individual therapy for some time (given I’m making good progress). If she seriously wants to move forward after everything that’s happened (my action and hers included) those are my terms. She has also agreed that I need to continue individual counseling, but I have not asked about relocation yet. Many commenters have said I’m trying to have “full financial control of my victim to keep her trapped” I don’t want her to be jobless. If it came down to her being jobless versus still working at the same hospital, I would accept her continuing to work. I wouldn’t want her to quit her job until she has another one lined up and secured. 

She is not in my control nor dependent on me, she is with her parents who are supporting her financially, and she can afford to live on her own if she wanted or needed to. She makes $130,000 annually, which is great money. I just make more ($215,000) which is why I paid for most of our bills. I have stated this several times but everyone still says the same thing like it’s fact, when it is seriously so far from the truth. My wife has always been an independent woman. I understand that abuse can make people feel weak and like they need to depend on that person and we have talked about this. She said that she doesn’t need me, she wants me. She assured me she doesn’t feel like this is stockholm syndrome or like she is trauma bonded to me, and this is her rational decision knowing the full truth behind everything I did. I don’t want her to be so traumatized she is staying with me because she feels like she has to which is why we talked  for hours about this and why she wants to stay. She told me she could live without me if she had to, but that she doesn’t want to. 

The situation I posted about was the only time I have ever acted that way and had thoughts like that. How do I know this is true when I couldn’t realize something evil I was doing was okay, and a mean spirited prank at best, you may ask. I wondered the same thing. I felt panicked trying to search my mental library and think about any time I’ve ever done something like this or hurt her intentionally and I couldn’t think of anything. That alone was not proof enough. We discussed this EXTENSIVELY in therapy, and our therapist was the one who initiated it. Our therapist asked her to recount other times when I exhibited abusive behavior in the 7 years we’ve been together (she didn’t say “abusive” when asking, this was majority of our one hour session and the therapist was asking her about certain traits and almost like a checklist of actions/behaviors that meet the criteria for abuse). She said there were none which is why it affected her so deeply. She couldn’t understand where this came from because I’ve never treated her like that and I felt the same way. She felt confused because she didn’t know what she did wrong and what happened to me to make me hurt her like that. She even compared me to people that have TBI and do a complete 180. 

I have not been abusing her for years like many commenters are saying, and I am not just saying it myself. Me clarifying the timeline is not my attempt to justify anything or skirt responsibility. Abuse is abuse, and abusing her for a few weeks versus a few years doesn't matter because she should have never been abused by me in the first place. What I did was egregious. My wife is intelligent and she knows the full scale of my actions. I was very honest and shared more than what was in the post. I am scared of myself and how I wanted to and was able to intentionally traumatize my wife through emotional abuse, weaponizing her mental health and trauma against her without seeing it’s wrong. I don’t want to be that person ever again which is why I am actively taking steps to improve myself. I may not have made enough progress for you but I am on the right track. I have so much work I need to do on myself before we can truly work on our marriage. Recognizing my behavior and seeking treatment is a lot better than not accepting it and wanting to keep doing it. When I made comments about how I’ve made progress, I was referring to marriage counseling. I clearly did not make progress in individual therapy because I quit after feeling uncomfortable.

In marriage counseling, we examined and challenged a lot of my beliefs. I also want to reiterate that I have never in my life done something like this, and it was only a few weeks, less than a month in the 84+ months we’ve been together. This is not me saying I am better now or that I’ve made a large amount of progress, nor do I believe I deserve praise. I have an extremely long way to go. Even though I have never done this before, what I did was INSANELY abusive and I need to find out why and work through that.

I was able to look my wife in my face while she cried and not feel a *shred* of empathy because I was getting something I wanted out of it. Me not recognizing the true effects and severity of my actions in the moment while seeing exactly what was happening to her is what raises a huge flag for me. It is scary to be honest. I’ve seen a lot of comments calling me a sociopath, and on another subreddit where this was reposted there were a lot of therapists that responded. I read what all of them had to say, and they also had the same consensus. A lot of people still thought this was rage bait because “no one can be that dense” and they talked about clients they’ve had that are just like me that are narcissistic sociopaths, and it scared me even more. 

I looked up sociopathy which is ASPD, and it’s pretty in line with how I acted and my mindset… I’ve always had trouble relating to the emotions of others and truly empathizing with them even though I’ve tried. I do care about others, I care about my wife way more than I’ve ever cared about anyone else, more than my own family, and I have always thought I cared about her feelings. I always did, until it came to her mental health being used for my benefit. I could not have possibly cared about her feelings in that moment if I was able to look at her in a traumatized state and think “good, she’s cleaning.” It’s psychotic. It came from a place of envy and feeling like I was competing, and she was the competitor versus what I viewed as competition (Claire). 

We talked extensively about how I view household chores and finances, and I have a different view on it now. I should have been doing more house work than her because I was home a lot more. The amount of money one is making should nothing to do with how housework is split. I don’t like failing which is why I never bothered to learn how to cook after my disasterpieces. If we eventually live together again and keep working on our marriage, that will change. A commenter had a wonderful idea regarding this and shared that learning how to cook meals together would be perfect for bonding. The expectations I had of her weren’t fair to her at all. Even before Claire, she still should not have done most of the cleaning, dishwashing, and all of the cooking. She never expressed feeling overwhelmed by it and needing me to do more, and thinking reflectively, it might be because she’s determined to be independent and wants to do everything herself. She doesn’t like asking for help from others which is why she shouldn’t have asked- I should have done it. 

We also defined my definition of abuse, and our therapist compared it to current research. I have learned a lot about abuse as a whole, and individual types of abuse. I abused her. I emotionally and psychologically abused my wife. There’s no justification for that, there’s no excuse, and there’s nothing that can make that better. Looking back on my childhood, I’ve always lacked empathy for others and found it hard to understand why people were crying and would be upset by certain experiences. This was never addressed in childhood and it carried into my adult life. I have an appointment set up for individual therapy with the same therapist I saw for two sessions. I didn’t give her a proper chance because I had false expectations of what therapy was, and I was panicked when it felt like she was making vulnerable.. I am ready now. My childhood needs to be explored.

I’ve learned that the way I react is a defense mechanism. When I feel attacked I become condescending and have an inflated ego, which leads to me insulting others. This is something I learned in therapy and am trying to work on. I can handle criticism a lot better, but when I’m insulted and for the comments specifically, when someone states their opinions that are wrong as a fact (saying I only want therapy to gain tactics to abuse my wife, for example, or the financial control debacle) I go full defense mode. I also became angry and defensive when I was told I'm not trying, my efforts aren't genuine and that I'm going to continue to abuse her. I’m going to go back to therapy for myself. I need to, and I want to be a better person. I never want to treat anyone this way again, ESPECIALLY my wife. I don’t know what went so horribly wrong with me. Even if my wife decides to leave me in the time it takes me to work on myself, I will respect her decision and continue treatment for myself. 

There are not enough words in the English dictionary to accurately describe how heinous and cruel my behavior was. I was extremely abusive and the way I used her trauma response as a tool to manipulate her into doing something so insignificant and unnecessary (cleaning) is incredibly disturbing. Me having the thought to do something like this in the first place was already disturbing. Me doing this ONCE was extremely disturbing. Me seeing what this was doing to my wife and feeling *proud* of it, thinking I was clever, is sick. Continuing to do this for weeks at the expense of my wife’s mental health (without even recognizing it as something that is actually costing her) is egregiously disgusting. It is bottom of the barrel, despicable evil. I know this, and my wife knows it as well. She has torn me a new one and she has every right to, and she deserves to do that and more to me whenever she needs to. Honestly, I think she could k*ll me and she would be justified to do so. 

With the help of our therapist, she described how deeply I truly hurt her. How I ripped open closed wounds only to make them bleed more than they have before. She explained how I made her question reality, and how she wished she was in a nightmare and would wake up soon. She started seeing me as the evil twin of her husband. She explained how I became a stranger to her, someone she didn’t recognize, and how it was conflicting. I saw her experience raw unfiltered emotions. She told me that what I did is unforgivable and it’s worse than anything she has ever been through because I used the trauma response of everything she has been through against her, for the sake of trying to morph her into another woman. When she was explaining how I made her feel about herself, I cried a little bit. I don’t think I have cried since I was 5 years old. I did something despicable and there's nothing that can atone for that. She deserves more than me, but she wants me, so I will continue working on myself and identifying harmful belief systems in order to change them. 

I will explore my childhood with my therapist and learn more about empathy and if that’s something I can develop more of. I will be fully honest in therapy about my thoughts and actions so I can be held accountable and accurately receive guidance in order to understand and change my behavior. Even if I am uncomfortable, even if I am vulnerable, and even if I feel attacked in therapy, I will do my best to retain an open mind. I will never quit, I will never run away, and I will never give up on becoming a better person. This is my promise to myself and to my wife. 

I only talked about negative things in a very aggressive way to the point where commenters accused me of not liking my wife, so I’d like to share some things about her. My wife is the most precious human to ever grace the Earth with her existence. She is kind, generous, patient, understanding, and loves helping others. Before she became an RN, she loved volunteering at animal shelters and reading with the elderly at nursing homes. My wife is a huge animal lover, and she treats them like they are human babies which I find adorable. I have always admired her selflessness and her passion for her interests and goals in life. She is an avid book reader (when she has the time which sadly isn’t much anymore, and time I have robbed her of in my selfishness), a coffee addict, and a gardener. She loves to go on nature walks and explore the outside world. Her face lights up and she experiences childlike joy when she finds a pretty rock or a pretty leaf. If I ever stumbled across one, I would give it to her. She would protect the leaves like they were the essence of life themselves, and she still has them on her shelves in our work/study room. My wife is hilarious, and she makes corny Dad jokes that make her laugh harder than anyone else. 

She is beautiful inside and out, and if souls had a color hers would be gold. She is extremely supportive and is my inspiration to work hard in life. I have always wanted to provide for her and give her everything she could ever dream of and more. I was always thinking in terms of grandiosity, overlooking what truly brings her the most joy in life: the little things. My wife is not materialistic. She likes thrift shopping and antiques. She is very passionate about our environment and I forgot to mention this, but my wife is the person that likes to clean up trash off the beach. We would do this anytime we went. She loves to watch the sea turtles hatch and crawl back into the ocean. Anyways, I always thought that my value was my money. I didn’t think that of her, only myself. She sees a different me that I can’t see. I’ve always had a strong urge to protect her from everything in this life, with how precious and fragile she is, and it makes me even more sick that what she needed protection from was *me.* She wants to heal our inner children together. I don’t know what she sees in me that makes what I have done worth working through. She is beautiful, smart, and the kind of girl you would interact with for 2 seconds in a grocery store and remember her forever, regretting that you didn’t try to get her number.

I deeply appreciate everyone I have interacted with. So many of you have provided me with invaluable information and insight to myself. I even appreciate those of you that teared me a new one, because I deserve no pity, no sympathy, no understanding. The only person deserving of that is my wife. I deserve the hatred, the insults and divine punishment. I’m sorry to everyone that was triggered by my posts, I’m sorry to the people that have cried reading my posts, and most of all I will always be deeply sorry, regretful, and ashamed of how I abused my wife. I handled myself horribly and my bruised ego controlled me.

This is goodbye for now. The only post I will ever make in the future is an update if I am diagnosed. A lot of users suspect I have NPD or ASPD. I still want to read everyone’s comments because they took the time out of their day to say something to me, regardless of what it is.",0,1749398397.0,u_Electronic_Act7658,0,0.5,False

1l6fjhj,https://i.redd.it/h739eaq57q5f1.jpeg,My stepmom is kind of a monster and my dad is in the middle,"This might be a very long post because context is needed…My dad and I were very close. He was my world. He met my stepmom when I was 11. She has always been a little on the crazy side. She is manipulative and spins wild stories. She decided my sister, Stevie, (year older than me) and I had “no life skills” when she met us. So after she and my dad moved in together she had us fold all the laundry, do the dishes and so on. Nothing crazy. I had to mow the lawn and help with the yard work. All solid life skills. One day when I was 12, she didn’t think I covered my nose and mouth well enough when I sneezed, which lead to me scrubbing the kitchen floor on my hands and knees with a rag for over a hour. There were multiple times where punishments like this were used. Saturdays were spent cleaning the house for 2-4 hours starting around 8am and lasting until lunch which was between 12 and 1. During this time, my sister and I would clean and she and my dad would sit in the kitchen drinking coffee and smoking weed. She would come inspect our work and point out what was wrong. I should mention, she didn’t work and was a “stay at home mom” to us. She also told me that my relationship with my dad wasn’t normal and I shouldn’t be that close to him. 

When  Stevie was 15 she ran away from home and started using drugs. She was found and my grandparents were helping her stay gone which lead to my dad wanting me to have limited contact with them. The problem for me is that my grandparents were a huge part of my life. My mom was a drug abuser and wasn’t in my life. My sister and I lived with them for years before moving back in with my dad shortly after my 11th birthday. I blamed my stepmom for my sister running away and her continued harsh punishments. When they found Stevie after she stole a vehicle, she was extremely strung out and ended up in treatment. My resentment towards my stepmom built up during this time and venting with and one of my outlets was writing stories. My friend and I wrote a story about pushing my stepmom down some stairs. Which was pure fiction. I should also mention that she was now pregnant with her first child. At the end of the school year, she went through my backpack found the stories and lost her shit. I was accused of being crazy, wanting to off my sibling, all kinds of stuff. To which I replied, nope. If I actually wanted to do any of those things, I wouldn’t have written any of it down. We also lived in a single story home so….no stairs to push anyone down. Stevie running away to now has been about 6 months in total. 

They sent me to a youth shelter so I “couldn’t harm” my stepmom. I was 14, alone and this was the beginning of my summer. I spent almost 2 months in the youth shelter before I ran away to my grandparents whom I had had zero contact with and they had no clue where I was. I ended up petitioning the court for guardianship to be placed with my grandparents. At the hearing, my dad told the judge I was homicidal and suicidal. There was a court ordered psychiatric evaluation done. Over the course of a month or 2 I met with a psychiatrist whom evaluated me. I took several personality tests, ink blots….at the end he went back to the court and said I was the most normal kid he had ever had to evaluate based off a court order and those stories were how I was coping with what I perceived as mental abuse. 

I moved in with my grandparents and started a new life there. My stepmom had my dad to herself and she was happy. 

Over the years, my stepmom and dad would be in and out of my life. Every few years my stepmom would start a fight and then we wouldn’t talk for a long time. If I wanted to see or talk to my dad, I had to apologize. During this time she also had 2 kids with my dad. There is an almost 20 year age gap between me and my youngest sibling. I (42 f) have a brother (27m) and sister (24f). In the past couple years a lot has happened. My dad is 70 and was diagnosed with Parkinson’s. 

Over Christmas my son (15m) made a commitment to my brother about his relationship. He asked if they were in a throuple. My brother and son went back and forth and said some inappropriate things to each other. I figured it was resolved. Later after we left, I told my son that was inappropriate and not to ask questions like that because my brother was sensitive towards it. I thought all was resolved. 

New Years Day I called to wish my dad and stepmom happy new year. During which time she starts screaming at me because my 15 year old hurt her son’s feelings. He’s 27. Said some wild shit to my actual child during this conversation. My dad starts yelling in the background how I am tearing the family apart. I couldn’t take it any more so I hung up and sent her a message saying she could stop screaming at me or we were done with the conversation until she started treating me like an adult.  She sent me a message back about how I needed to educate myself about my dad’s condition and how he can’t take this emotional roller coaster. We haven’t spoken since that message. After 30 years of gaslighting and everything being my fault I couldn’t take it any more.

Well yesterday, my “dad” wrote me a message. He is a blue collar guy who is not super educated and was never good at writing. I love my dad and would love to have him in my life but I don’t know if my mental health can take it. I added a screenshot of his very well worded message. My biggest problem is that he wrote that I called and yelled about my communication with my younger siblings. Which isn’t at all what happened. They are rewriting what happened to make me the problem. Because it can never be them. I want to let my dad back in my life, but I don’t know if it’s healthy. Any advice would be appreciated.

1l6fe07,https://www.reddit.com/r/IBD/comments/1l6fe07/i_dont_think_i_have_ibs/,I don't think I have IBS,"21F woman here.

I was diagnosed with IBS 2 years ago with chronic gastritis. Sometimes I have pain and bloating in the gut. I’m slowly losing weight (1 kg per year), hair and energy. I wake up early in the morning with digestive discomfort. For 2 years, after I told my family doctor I had these symptoms, I was diagnosed with IBS because according to her, at my age, I can’t have serious diseases other than IBS. She told me I only had to adjust my diet and focus on stress management. So, I stopped eating some irritating foods like dairy products (except cheese), some vegetables and fruits, spicy and greasy foods, alcohol and coffee. But the symptoms never went away. I always had abnormal blood levels with a fall in white blood cells and increased immunoglobulins G and M and gamma globulins. But my family doctor told me it wasn’t alarming. She didn’t even notice I was losing weight too. 2 weeks ago, I had a new symptom and it was blood in the stools. I never had this before and it scares me because it came out of nowhere because my gut didn’t hurt that much at that moment. I noticed that my stools were thicker, harder and easier to evacuate. They used to be softer, stickier and harder to evacuate. I saw blood again this week. I had a bowel ache afterwards. I saw a gastroenterologist 2 weeks ago for a fibroscopy because I was concerned by my symptoms in the stomach related to gastritis because PPIs didn’t work anymore for me and caused side effects. I also told her about my abnormal stools and she told me it had to be IBS because I was too young to have something else. I will get a fibroscopy soon and I’m planning to ask for a colonoscopy too because the symptoms are really alarming. I don’t know what to do and I don’t want to have a serious disease just because I wasn’t taken seriously by doctors. 

What do you think of my situation? I really want to know your experiences and I’d be glad to read some advice because this situation is really stressful. Moreover, I have many serious cases in my family like stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. It scares me even more and I feel like I can’t do much to improve this situation. I don't think I have IBS but IBD instead because it's more coherent with my case. ",1,1749397860.0,IBD,0,1.0,False

Yesterday was my first wedding anniversary and our church does a birthday/anniversary prayer where everyone who is celebrating one or the other is invited up to receive a blessing. I've dreaded this day for a month. Going up alone wouldn't look right when I just went up for my birthday and couples go up together, but neither would staying in the pew when my tight-knit community knows it's my anniversary especially from my FB post.

We were unable to go out of town for our anniversary and then someone who I'm recruiting for a committee asked to talk at coffee hour this week, so I couldn't just skip this one. I asked my husband if he'd come to church with me this week and he was up for it but he sleeps opposite schedule as me and was up until 4 or 5am (tbf I was up until 3 watching Netflix with him and still got up, so I'm a little miffed he couldn't do it this one time).

My husband loves my priest and asked that she marry us. She really likes my husband and has even alleviated my own concerns about being ""unequally yoked"" in the past. So did my family. My husband loves everyone he's met from my church and tells me during snowstorms to leave early so I get there. He joined my potluck with my prayer group at our home. He's supportive. 

I know I can't assume that me joining a radically inclusive faith and community would open the doors to his belief, but I guess I hoped that that, with meeting the people he has, with attending with me on rare occasions like today, might have. I left the Catholic Church because I realized I couldn't ask him to believe that when I didn't. He's asked questions before and said he'd maybe go when we had kids to take together, but last night he made the valid point he doesn't want to live a lie to his kids, which I think is incredibly fair. 

Now all the little pangs in the past have me spiraling a bit, like the families in church with their kids who we'll never be, and the couples who go up for their anniversary prayer every year hand in hand. Yet he's my person **in every other way** which is why I married him. Church started 46 minutes ago and I'm writing this from the parking lot, planning to meet the person at coffee hour in 30 and say i overslept. ",2,1749397747.0,Episcopalian,0,1.0,False

Right then, Jameson called Joshua. The phone rang twice before Joshua answered. Joshua, I hope I'm not bothering you this late,"" Jameson began. No,"" Joshua replied. Jameson asked, ""Is Shermaine with you? Instead of giving a direct answer, Joshua simply said, ""She's asleep. Jameson was overjoyed, putting on the tone of a loving father. ""I haven't done a good job taking care of Shermaine. I thought her mother could handle her situation, but it turns out we still had to trouble you in the end. To be honest, the fact that Joshua got involved had taken Jameson by surprise. The York family had really handed Jameson a gift he never saw coming. To Jameson, interests came first. If Shermaine and Joshua really got married, the Jean family's business and reputation would only grow stronger. But Shermaine's a proper young lady from a respectable family. Staying out all night like that doesn't really look good,"" Jameson said hesitantly, testing the waters. We're engaged. Her staying the night with me is perfectly reasonable,"" Joshua remarked, his voice gentle and deep. Jameson relaxed. ""So you're saying the engagement still stands? It does,"" Joshua replied. Jameson continued, ""Then regarding the wedding—if you're free tomorrow, why don't you and Shermaine come by our place? We can sit down and talk things through. How about that? I'll come by tomorrow afternoon,"" Joshua said. Thanks to the whiskey, Shermaine had slept soundly all night. By the time she woke up, it was already ten in the morning.

Her stomach growled with hunger. With no phone in hand, she couldn't order delivery. She checked the fridge and found out that there were two eggs left.

After finishing breakfast, she pulled 30 bucks out of a drawer, changed her clothes, and grabbed a cab back to the Jean residence.

Shermaine didn't want to go back, but her phone was still there, so she had no choice but to go pick it up. She took her time and didn't arrive until nearly twelve o'clock.

Little did Shermaine know, some people had already been waiting for her with growing impatience ever since word got out that Joshua had taken her away last night and she hadn't come home since.

The moment Shermaine stepped through the front door, the housekeeper Peyton Snow froze for a second before reacting. ""Ms. Shue, welcome home.""

Shermaine gave her a cool nod. When she walked into the living room, she saw Ruth and Wendelyn seated properly on the sofa. The moment they saw her, their eyes immediately fell on her.

Ruth and Wendelyn had assumed Shermaine would come back with Joshua, but she walked in alone. Ruth thought, 'Good. There are things I'd rather not say in front of outsiders anyway.'

Wendelyn stared at Shermaine, her expression unreadable, her fingers nervously twisting together.

Ruth's face darkened. ""Why are you just getting home now?""

Shermaine raised an eyebrow and wondered, 'Did she already find out Joshua took me from the hospital last night?'

""I overslept,"" she replied.

Ruth snapped, ""You're a proper lady and the heiress of a respectable family. Even if you're engaged to Joshua, you should know your boundaries. How could you spend the night alone with him?""

Shermaine was confused for a second but quickly caught on. She realized Joshua must have misled them. Since Ruth's tone was already harsh, Shermaine smiled faintly, ""I spent the night at my fiancé's. What's the problem?""

Ruth yelled, ""Watch your mouth. You and Joshua had never even met before. There are no feelings between you two. If this gets out, what do you think people will say about our family?""

""Whoever dares to run their mouth better be ready for Joshua to deal with them,"" Shermaine said, sounding very much like someone using her status for leverage.

Ruth was utterly speechless.

Wendelyn spoke up, ""Mom, don't be mad at Shermaine. It's our fault for not bringing her home last night. Otherwise, we wouldn't have troubled Mr. York.""

Ruth stayed silent, thinking, 'She's right. If I'd known Joshua would go to the hospital, I wouldn't have left so soon. That really backfired.'

Wendelyn looked at Shermaine, her gaze full of concern. ""Shermaine, have you had lunch yet? If not, I can ask Peyton to make something for you.""

""I already ate,"" Shermaine replied.

""Good,"" Wendelyn said, as if trying to ease the tension between them.

Ruth took a moment to collect herself and softened her tone. ""Shermaine, I'm only being strict with you because I want what's best for you.""

Shermaine smiled faintly, offering no comment.

""Come sit,"" Ruth said even more gently. ""There's something I want to talk to you about.""

Shermaine didn't even need to guess what Ruth was thinking. She went over and sat down, ready to hear whatever it was.

Ruth asked, ""After meeting Mr. York last night, what do you think of him?""

""He's great,"" Shermaine replied.

Ruth nodded. ""Mr. York's success and ability are beyond what ordinary men can match. He took control of most of the York family's business at such a young age.

""Even your father has to show him some deference in the business world—he doesn't dare act like a senior. In the eyes of women, he's elegant and distinguished, the man of their dreams. There are countless women who dream of marrying him.""

""Your grandfather had the foresight to speak with Mr. York's grandfather early on and arrange this engagement between you and Mr. York. You were both lucky and unlucky.

""You were so young back then, but because of that accident, you lost our family's protection and care. After you turned five, you grew up in a poor village and went through a hard life.

""You never received a proper education. There's not a trace of refinement in you—nothing that resembles how a lady from a prestigious family should carry herself.

""And after you came back to us, all of those flaws were blown out of proportion because of how much your status had suddenly risen.

""The York family's standards are even higher than ours. Their rules are stricter, too. I honestly don't think you're fit to marry into the York family. I don't want to see you suffer over there.""

Shermaine's expression didn't change. She thought, 'If I'm not suited to marry him, then who is? Wendelyn?' She let out a soft laugh, her expression thoughtful. ""You're right, Mom.""

Ruth smiled, ""Then when Mr. York comes by later, if he brings up the engagement, just say you don't want to marry him. If the York family takes offense, I'll take the blame.""

Wendelyn's expression subtly eased. She thought, 'Good. At least Shermaine knows her place.'

Shermaine pondered, 'So Joshua's coming over? That explains everything.'

She really hadn't wanted to marry Joshua at first. But what she wanted even less was to hand him over to Wendelyn on a silver platter.

Shermaine thought, 'This was supposed to be my engagement in the first place, and now I'm expected to step aside like some sweet, self-sacrificing pushover? What part of me looks that generous?'

Then she said, ""Mom, you make a fair point. But I still want to marry Joshua.""

Hearing that, Ruth and Wendelyn both froze, their expressions turning gloomy.

Shermaine continued, ""Grandpa worked hard to secure this marriage for the Jean family. If we back out now, wouldn't that be a waste? If it means I have to swallow a little pride and go through with it, I can handle that.""

Ruth snapped, ""Shermaine, you're not good enough for Joshua. You need to let go of that thought right now.""

Wendelyn chimed in, ""Shermaine, Mom's doing this for your own good. She means well. You don't have to shut her down like that.""

Shermaine found it laughable. Her eyes turned cold. ""Oh, come on, Wendelyn. This whole speech was just to push me aside so you could take my place, wasn't it? Saying I'm not good enough—how convenient.""

Wendelyn's expression stiffened.

Ruth didn't even bother pretending anymore. ""Am I wrong? Wendelyn's a better match than you.""

Wendelyn pressed her lips together and said softly, ""Shermaine, everyone in the Jean family knows how deeply I love Mr. York. Please don't blame Mom.""

She paused. ""Mom didn't mean what she said. She just didn't want to see me keep crushing on Mr. York all these years with nothing to show for it, so she hoped you'd give up the engagement.

""Shermaine, I know it's a lot to ask, but could you please let me have this?""

Shermaine thought, 'Figures. Mom's only good to Wendelyn. She grants her every wish. As for me, I've never even gotten a kind look from her.'

Shermaine's tone was cold as she turned Ruth down. ""Sorry, but no.""

# Chapter 5 A Sharp Tongue

Wendelyn's face went pale as she stood there like a withering leaf about to fall.

Furious, Ruth exploded. ""If you don't want to give that up, fine. But why do you have to tear your sister down like that?""

""Because I can't stand her, obviously,"" Shermaine smiled sweetly, but her words cut sharp. ""She's petty, but her ambitions are huge.""

It wasn't that Shermaine thought too highly of herself—Wendelyn was just rotten underneath that sweet-girl act. She had no morals and a mean streak, the kind of fake sweetheart who played innocent while scheming behind everyone's back.

""And for the record, I only have a brother. No sister,"" Shermaine said. She was beautiful in a way that burned—like a rose in full bloom, bold and brazen, with thorns sharp enough to draw blood.

Ruth's eyes sparked with fury. She thought, 'Why did this brat have to come back after all these years?' Her chest heaved, anger choking her. She raised her hand.

Shermaine pondered, 'She wanna hit me again?' She crossed one leg over the other, her eyes steady, her smile still lingering. Without a hint of fear, her gaze was bright and piercing. It made Ruth's heart skip without reason.

Ruth thought, 'Shermaine's just some nobody who grew up in some backwater village with no education and no class. How the hell does she get that attitude, that presence?'

But her raised hand didn't get the chance to fall. Jameson's voice boomed like thunder. ""Ruth, what do you think you're doing?""

Ruth looked up and saw Jameson standing there, his brows furrowed, his expression stormy. What really made her panic, though, was the man standing beside him—elegant and composed—Joshua.

Joshua didn't do a thing, but with just one look, the pressure came down like a wave. Ruth could barely breathe.

She stiffened, lowering her hand, forcing a calm tone. ""What could I possibly be doing?""

Then, as if nothing had happened, Ruth greeted Joshua politely, ""Mr. York, it's a pleasure to meet you.""

Jameson shot Ruth an irritated glare, then turned to the maid and ordered her to grind their best coffee beans and brew a fresh pot.

""Likewise, Mrs. Jean,"" Joshua said coolly.

Ruth offered, ""Please, have a seat.""

Joshua walked over.

Wendelyn's eyes lit up. The moment she saw Joshua, her affection for him filled her gaze with soft longing. But she quickly suppressed it, not daring to look at him again.

Joshua's presence was magnetic. Just one glance at him made others feel inferior.

He didn't even glance at Wendelyn. Instead, he went straight to sit next to Shermaine.

Joshua was polished and poised. Meanwhile, Shermaine was stunning and fierce. People had expected their temperaments to clash, but the two sitting together somehow looked effortlessly perfect like they were meant to be.

A flash of disappointment crossed Wendelyn's eyes.

Joshua asked Shermaine, ""Did you sleep well last night?""

Shermaine smiled, ""Not bad.""

Wendelyn's face turned even paler. Her hands clenched tight, her nails digging deep into her palms.

The rich aroma of coffee filled the room. Jameson handed a cup to Joshua. ""Joshua, when do you plan to have the wedding with Shermaine?""

""The elders are already picking a date,"" Joshua replied.

Jameson thought, 'That means it's happening soon.'

He was just about to ask more about the wedding when Ruth cut in, ""Mr. York, I don't think Shermaine is a good match for you. Maybe it's too early to talk about marriage.""

""What nonsense are you talking about?"" Jameson was pissed at Ruth. If she ruined this marriage, it would be a total loss for the Jean family.

""Oh?"" Joshua looked at Ruth, waiting to see what other ridiculous things she was about to say.

Ruth spoke slowly and deliberately, ""Over the past few years, we failed to raise her properly, and now she's got problems all over. If she marries into your family, I'm afraid she'll only embarrass the Yorks.""

Then she paused and added, ""I truly believe Wendy would be a better match for you. She's well-mannered, considerate, and knows her place. She's outstanding—so much better than Shermaine.""

Ruth said with pride, ""Wendy, raise your head and let Joshua get a good look at you.""

Wendelyn's heart was pounding like crazy. She slowly looked up, her voice shy and delicate. ""Mr. York.""

Her tone was soft and sweet, dripping with that feminine charm. But her palms were already slick with nervous sweat.

Bradley, standing off to the side, wanted to roll his eyes. He thought, 'Mrs. Jean really doesn't even try to hide her favoritism.

'She tears Ms. Shue down just to build Ms. Jean up like Ms. Shue doesn't even exist, as if Ms. Shue chose to be separated from the Jean family and grow up without them.

'The one who was originally engaged to Mr. York was the Jean family's actual heiress by blood.

'Besides, Ms. Shue doesn't even look like someone who grew up in some backwater village. Just because of a little bias, they're acting like she's good for nothing.'

Joshua took a sip of coffee with a smile sharp enough to cut. ""Since when did the York family's standards drop this low?"" His tone was steady, almost casual. ""Mrs. Jean, you really think you can throw just anyone at me?""

Wendelyn froze, her expression turning stiff and awkward. That one line from him crushed her dignity and ground it straight into the dirt.

As the adopted daughter of Jameson and Ruth, Wendelyn had grown up pampered, showered with praise, and idolized by the boys around her. She couldn't understand how, in Joshua's eyes, she meant absolutely nothing.

Wendelyn thought, 'If I'm nothing, then what the hell is Shermaine? What makes her so much better than me?'

Bradley pondered, 'Mr. York's such a badass.'

Ruth, barely holding back her anger, stepped in for Wendelyn. ""Mr. York, even if Wendy's not your type, that's no reason to humiliate her like this.""

Joshua smiled, ""Mrs. Jean, Compared to what you just said about Shermaine, I'm being pretty polite.""

Ruth froze, like she'd just swallowed a bug by accident.

Shermaine gave a light smile and thought, 'Mr. York's got such a sharp tongue.'

Jameson looked at Ruth and Wendelyn coldly and then turned toward Joshua. ""Mr. York, please forgive my wife and adopted daughter for their performance. If we're going to discuss the wedding between you and Shermaine, let's take it upstairs to the study.""

Joshua gave a nod, then looked over at Shermaine. ""Are you coming with me?""

""You go,"" Shermaine replied, sounding indifferent.

\*\*\*\*\*

Back in the living room, Shermaine poured herself a cup of coffee. The beans were top-notch. The taste was smooth and fragrant, leaving a clean finish on the tongue.

She drank a few sips, then stood up, planning to go upstairs. She needed to grab her phone. Once Joshua was gone, she wanted to head out for a walk.

Ruth had just been publicly embarrassed and sat in silence, glaring at Shermaine. When she saw Shermaine get up, Ruth asked, ""Where are you going?""

""To my room,"" Shermaine said.

""Don't bother. We have guests coming soon,"" Ruth replied.

Wendelyn was staring at Shermaine too, her expression composed but sharp-edged.

Shermaine thought, 'Guests? What's that got to do with me? I don't care. Let them stare at me all they want—not like they'll find anything.'

Just then, the housekeeper stepped forward and reminded them, ""Mrs. Jean, the ladies you invited have arrived at the front door.""

""Got it,"" Ruth replied.

Moments later, a group of well-dressed socialites walked in, each one decked out in designer glam from head to toe.

Ruth's expression switched in an instant. A graceful, practiced smile bloomed across her features. ""Mrs. Sutton, Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. Burton, so glad you could make it.""

Wendelyn stood up alongside her and greeted them with a soft, elegant smile.

Shermaine didn't move. All eyes from the new arrivals landed right on her.

She glanced up and realized she'd seen these women at the party at the hotel last night. They'd praised her beauty to her face, then trashed her behind her back.

Shermaine hadn't forgotten how they'd called her a ""cheap slut"" the moment she'd turned away.

""Shermaine,"" Ruth snapped, ""don't be so rude.""

Shermaine kept her smile. ""Mrs. Sutton, Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. Burton. Nice to see you.""

The three ladies nodded at her coolly.

Ruth's expression finally eased. ""Peyton, show our guests to the garden."" Then she turned to Wendelyn and Shermaine. ""You two, come with me.""

""I'm not going,"" Shermaine said flatly.

""Don't you dare."" Ruth's face shifted again.

Shermaine gave her a half-smile, thinking, 'Whatever. She's still technically my mother, right?' So she caved. ""Fine. I'll give you this one.""

Furious, Ruth nearly choked on her own breath.

The backyard was exactly what one would expect from old money—landscaped to perfection, with a shimmering pool glinting under the sun.

These women had nothing to talk about except designer clothes and handbags, lipsticks and perfumes, and outrageously expensive jewelry.

The pieces they wore today were all from luxury brands—none under thirty grand, some running well into the hundreds of thousands. The designs were undeniably exquisite, but somehow, on them, even the most ethereal pieces managed to look tacky as hell.

Shermaine yawned, bored out of her mind listening to their empty chatter. Today, she wore a white silk blouse tucked into her high-waisted jeans, the cut showing off the graceful lines of her legs.

Her neckline dipped just enough to reveal the beautiful curve of her collarbones—equal parts sultry and ethereal.

Just then, some new people arrived. They were there to give everyone head and foot massages.

Shermaine wasn't feeling it. She didn't have the patience, and honestly, if she'd known it was going to be this boring, she would've just gone upstairs with Joshua. She was about to turn around and leave when Ruth caught her.

""Trying to sneak off again?"" Ruth asked.

""I'll pass on the massage,"" Shermaine said. ""Not interested.""

""Their technique's excellent. Sit down and let yourself unwind a little,"" Ruth insisted.

Shermaine was instantly speechless. She genuinely had no interest in listening to people who didn't actually care about her.

Just then, an esthetician in uniform said, ""Ms. Shue, please lie down.""

She was at least polite, and Shermaine thought for a moment. Not wanting to make things hard for the esthetician, Shermaine gave in and lay down.

The esthetician washed her hands and applied some essential oil, which gave off a light, pleasant scent.

At first, the massage felt pretty good. Shermaine was actually enjoying it. But then the esthetician started pressing harder and harder, and some spots hurt like hell.

Shermaine told her to ease up. The esthetician agreed, but her hands stayed just as rough.

After a while, the pain was too much. Shermaine opened her eyes, irritation flashing in her gaze. She couldn't take it anymore and gave the esthetician a shove.

Shermaine didn't even push that hard, but the esthetician stumbled backward several steps, and with a splash, fell straight into the pool.

# Chapter 6 Playing Along

Shermaine hadn't expected a simple massage to turn into a setup. She thought, 'Ruth really nailed it as a mother—doing everything she can to ruin my image and sabotage my engagement to Joshua, just to shove Wendelyn into my place.'

She'd assumed that after Joshua made his stance clear, Ruth would finally back off. But clearly, she'd overestimated Ruth's intelligence. Either that, or Ruth's bias had clouded all judgment.

Shermaine wondered, 'How could someone like Ruth possibly be my mother? I just don't get it.'

Her blank expression didn't change as she stared at the esthetician flailing in the water.

Ruth's voice came sharp with reproach. ""Look what you've done."" She reached out and hauled the esthetician out of the pool.

The esthetician was soaked head to toe, coughing from all the water she'd swallowed, looking completely pathetic.

Ruth kept going. ""She was just giving you a normal massage. What could she possibly have done to offend you? With a temper like yours, who can stand being around you?

""Honestly, I should hire you an etiquette coach to teach you some proper manners before people start thinking I failed as a mother.""

Shermaine stood there taking it as Ruth kept rattling on.

Sadie Sutton remarked, ""Shermaine, don't take this the wrong way, but you really need to dial that temper back. Even if her technique sucked, you could've just said so. Did you really have to shove her into the pool?""

Lottie Marshall chimed in too, ""Why do you have to make things difficult for that poor girl?""

Maria Burton joined the chorus. ""And you're the Jean family's heiress. You need to think about your family's reputation before you act like this. Don't give people something to gossip about.""

The three ladies started babbling on with Ruth, going off on all kinds of nonsense.

With their voices buzzing in her ears, Shermaine felt her head throb. Her face stayed stony as she snapped, ""Shut up.""

The three ladies instantly froze, stunned by the force of her presence.

Ruth stayed perfectly composed and said, ""Wendy, go upstairs and bring a change of clothes for this lady.""

""Okay, Mom."" Wendelyn had just stepped back into the living room when she saw Jameson and Joshua coming down the stairs. She walked up to them and greeted, ""Dad, Mr. York.""

Jameson nodded in response, but Joshua didn't even acknowledge her.

Wendelyn lowered her gaze slightly and bit her lip. 'Everyone says Joshua's always the perfect gentleman with women, so why is he acting the exact opposite with me?' she wondered.

But the answer was obvious. The only reason he treated her this coldly was because of Shermaine.

Jameson asked, ""Where's Shermaine?""

""She's in the backyard,"" Wendelyn replied.

Jameson said, ""Go call her over to see Mr. York off.""

Wendelyn hesitated, looking conflicted. ""Dad, I don't think she'll come. Shermaine just pushed an esthetician who came to give her a facial massage into the pool. Mom's out there lecturing her right now.""

Jameson's expression shifted slightly. 'Another mess?' he thought. He glanced at Joshua's face, but Joshua gave nothing away, his expression unreadable as ever.

Jameson pondered for a moment, then said, ""In that case, you go see Mr. York off for her.""

""Alright,"" Wendelyn answered.

She was, after all, the dutiful adopted daughter who'd stayed by Jameson's side for years. He knew exactly what Wendelyn was thinking. Jameson figured that giving her a moment alone with Joshua was the least he could do.

Jameson thought, 'If she really has what it takes to win Joshua over and marry into the York family, then good for her. That'd be a much more respectable match than Shermaine ending up with him.'

But in the next second, that hope was crushed. Joshua didn't give Wendelyn the slightest chance.

""No need,"" Joshua replied coolly. ""If Shermaine can't come to me, I'll go to her.""

Jameson felt the awkwardness sink in. ""Alright,"" he said, finally letting go of the idea.

""Which way's the backyard?"" Joshua asked.

""I'll take you,"" Jameson said.

Wendelyn stood there all alone, a quiet ache pressing in her chest. She thought, 'Just because I'm adopted, Joshua won't even give me a chance.'

Meanwhile, out in the backyard, Shermaine pressed her red lips together.

The esthetician sobbed as she complained to Ruth, insisting that her technique had always been the best at the spa, that no client had ever left a bad review, and there was no way she could've been too rough.

She insisted she was just an ordinary person who wouldn't dare offend the Jean family or their heiress.

It was clear what the esthetician meant—Shermaine was the one with the bad temper, unreasonable and impossible to deal with, picking on someone like the esthetician herself who had no power to fight back.

Under the sunlight, Joshua approached at a steady pace. The scenery wasn't anything special, but with him in the frame, it suddenly looked like something straight out of an oil painting—rich and vivid.

His eyes fell on Shermaine. She looked stunning. There was a chill in her expression, the hint of a smile playing at her lips, calm and aloof. To Joshua, it was like watching a black rose slowly bloom, its scent intoxicating but lethal.

The three ladies were the first to notice Joshua walking beside Jameson. Their expressions shifted, surprise flashing across their faces, followed by envy that the Jean family could actually form a connection with the Yorks.

Ruth's eyes flicked over as she quickly assumed her usual air of moral superiority. ""Shermaine, I'm really disappointed in you. When will you stop making me worry?""

""Mom, why don't you believe me?"" Shermaine's eyes shimmered like they were glazed with tears, her voice full of hurt. She looked heartbreakingly vulnerable and beautiful, every edge and thorn suddenly tucked away. That softness made her almost impossible not to pity.

Ruth faltered. Shermaine had always been sharp and defiant, but now, this sudden shift caught Ruth completely off guard, leaving her at a loss for how to respond.

""Is it that no matter what I say or do, you'll never believe me?"" Shermaine's eyes welled up, her voice thick with sadness. ""Tell me—who's really your daughter, her or me?

""Last night was like this. Today's the same. You never ask what really happened. You just jump straight to blaming me. The first thing you do is raise your hand to hit me.

""If I really annoy you that much, I'll leave the Jean family. I won't be your daughter anymore. There's no need to be so mean to me.

""You're right. I didn't grow up with the guidance of you and Dad all those years. So how could I possibly become the picture-perfect debutante you've always wanted me to be?""

Shermaine's voice was full of sorrow as tears rolled down her cheeks. That last line hit Ruth like a punch straight to the chest.

Shermaine stood up right after, pressing her hand to her temple, her face pale with discomfort, her body swaying unsteadily.

Jameson, who had clearly heard everything and now saw Shermaine barely able to stay on her feet, called out, ""Shermaine.""

In the next moment, she fell into the warm, faintly fragrant embrace of Joshua. His arm wrapped around her waist, pulling her gently into his chest.

Shermaine's lashes fluttered slightly. She didn't open her eyes, just buried her face in the crook of his neck and murmured, ""Mr. York, do me a favor.""

There was a cunning edge to her voice. She was like a fox—sharp, sly, and quietly ruthless.

1l6fatd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l6fatd/confused_over_coworker_i_like_this_is_gonna_be/,Confused over coworker I like (this is gonna be long one guys),"So I work at as an admin at a sales office in a big city and have had a crush on my coworker for some time now. I’m a 27M and she’s a 28F. When I first met her I wasn’t interested in her. She seemed nice but was always quiet and kind of closed off. I’m the same way. She’s also in and out a lot. The sales people are independent contractors and aren’t required to come in. She has stretches where she works and doesn’t work. 

Over time I started making a point to talk to her more and realized I kind of liked her. We had a company bbq and we both went. I talked to her more there. It was a good time. She started coming around a bit more and started approaching me more. Asking work related questions but also lingering by my desk a lot. There was one day when I got off and she was still in the office. Everyone else had left so I stayed and talked to her. We talked for three hours. She was telling me where she was from, how she got to the city we live in after a recent break up, things like that. She mentions how she needs to take the bus home but I see the bus pass several times. I’m taking this a good sign so far. She does end up leaving and I’m feeling ecstatic about it.

I ask my roommates (who are both girls) for advice on what to do. They tell me next time I see her I should ask her to hang out outside of work. She doesn’t come in a for about a month after this. I’m feeling a little antsy at this point. One of my work friends says I should just call her and ask her to hang out. I’m hesitant to do this because I don’t want to come on too strong and scare her off. That’s not my personality. 

One day she does come in and to pick up a form for a client. She seems a little off. For context she does smoke a lot of weed for anxiety and health issues. She probably just smoked before coming in. She grabs the form and sits for a while at the table next to me. I wanted to ask her to hang out but was too nervous. There were other people in the room, it didn’t seem like the right time. She then randomly gets and leaves without saying anything. My work friend sees this all happen and tells me to go outside to catch her before she leaves. I go outside and she’s already gone. He tells me I should just call her today. After going back and forth I try calling her before I leave. She doesn’t pick so I just text asking if she’s free and wants to get food with me tonight. She doesn’t respond for almost 24 hours. When she does she tells me that she thought she already responded but had plans yesterday and thanked for me asking. I’m a little let down and take this a possible soft rejection. My roommates tell me I made the wrong move and that maybe I can try again when I see her in the office. I also take a day to respond and just say no worries, I wasn’t at all sure what to say. 

At this point I’m nervous for whenever she comes in again. I feel like I blew it and now’s it awkward. I tell another work friend about the situation, let’s call him T. T tells me she has a long term boyfriend. I had no clue at all. T says she probably told him because he’s a gay man and felt more comfortable. I’m not sure. I feel like an idiot but she also never mentioned that to me. I’ve never heard her bring it up. She told me him at the bbq we had one but I wasn’t with them at that second. Maybe she got back together with the guy she broke up with. I’m glad to have closure but I also feel like an asshole.

She does eventually come in for an office meeting. I avoid talking to her out of embarrassment. I know that I need to make it not awkward but at this point I feel like I just need to leave her alone. She comes in here and there and still no talking. We’re avoiding each other which just makes it more awkward. Over time though we do start talking again. One day it was just the two of us the after my boss and left I made a joke about how happy I was he finally left for the day. She laughed and we stated talking like we used to. At this point I know nothing will happen but I’m glad we can still talk and be friendly.

We have a work party about two months later and she comes. I’m talking with her a bit and sitting with her. We’re both shy in these situations so we stuck together. I get up to grab a drink and T tells me that she’s single now. He was asking how she was and she told him she was down because her boyfriend broke up with her. I was very surprised about this. She’s now single. I wasn’t sure what to do but I knew I wanted to feel things out. I also needed to be careful considering what happened last time. We keep talking. We’re both smiling and laughing a lot at each other. Once the party is over we all go out to a bar. We sat by the piano and I’m stealing glances at her and smiling. I go to the bathroom and when I come back up she’s talking to another girl we work with. They’re talking about her breakup. She’s saying how it was a long distance relationship and she’s only ever done long term. She’s doesn’t really date but figures she should try now. Our coworker turns around and asks me if I’m seeing anyone. I say no and they both just smile. My crush says she’s going to a dispensary down the street to grab a joint. When she gets back I look out at her and she motions for me to join her. I took a few hits and we’re talking more. I mention how I have girl roommates (I feel it’s a good disarming tactic). She surprised but intrigued about that. Soon after we get in an uber to go back to the office and then head home from  there. She does offer me a ride but we live in opposite directions. I wish I just said yes.

I’m waiting now to see when she’ll come to the office again. Weeks pass and she doesn’t. I’m trying to figure out what to do. We had such a  good interaction at the party. T suggests we make a plan and invite her to come. I don’t think I should do one on one at this point. A group setting would be better and less pressure on her. We decide to go the dog park as we all have one. T asks her for me and she immediately says yes to coming. The day comes to go but while I’m on the way T checks in with her and she says she can’t make it anymore. She went out of town earlier in the week and got stuck out where she was. I’m let down of course. We try pushing for next week but since he’s messaging her on our work app and she doesn’t see it in time. She barely checks it. 

My roommate suggests I invite my crush to her birthday party. T is supposed to be coming as well since he’s friends with my roommate so this could be a good idea. I ask her to come and she takes a few hours to respond but hearts my message and says she’ll come. I give her the details for the party the next day. The day of the party comes and I text her telling her to let me know when she’s there so I can let her in. She responds saying she’s so stupid and has a relative visiting today. I don’t take this well, my first thought is that’s she making an excuse to not come. My roommate tells me not to worry too much about it. I respond saying no worries maybe another time. She texts back apologizing and that she probably looks like a flake but to invite her to whatever I’m doing next. I’m feeling much better and tell her I’ll hit her up soon.

I’m beaming the next day. I’m finally in a good place with this girl. My sister calls me to check in and I tell her about this girl. She’s asking about what the girl said and I figure I’ll just send a screenshot it make it easier. I fuck up and send it to my crush on an accident. She texts me: “LMAO I saw that”. She then sends me a picture of her relative eating pizza and says “That’s me with her yesterday if you don’t believe meee”. I’m freaking out now. My sister thinks she’s mad and tries to calm me down. I ask my roommates for advice and they tell me I just have to laugh it off. They don’t thinks she’s mad. I say “lol you got me 😂😭” and she laughs at the message. I’m not sure where we stand now. I hope she’s not upset and wants to still see me. My roommates think I need to wait until I see her in person to talk to her again. I don’t like this idea since hasn’t been in the office for over a month. I don’t want to wait months to see her again. 

Two week pass and I go against my roommate’s advice. I ask her to get coffee that Saturday. She takes a day and a half to get back to me. I honestly thought it was over and she ghosted me. She hearts my message and says she’s definitely down to do that. I’m so happy about this. I finally get to spend time with her. 

I get to the coffee shop a little early and get us a table. She’s late because of her dog. We order and I pay for the coffee. We talked about work, what she’s been up to, funny stories, and really just catching up with each other. It seems to be going well. She asks if I want to go on a walk. I say yes and we walk to the park. We walk around for a bit and then just walk around the neighborhood. The conversation is going good. She says we should get a joint and we go to her local dispensary. We smoke half of it and walk around more. She finds this flea market and we go in. She’s making fun of the weird things there, I’m laughing and enjoying it. We eventually leave and are walking around again. It starts to feel like I should make my exit. We were together for almost four hours. She asks me how I’m going to get home. I’m not sure since I would have to take two subways or two buses to get back. I settle on taking a bike back (where live they have bike stands on the street where you can rent  e-bikes for cheap). She walks with me to the stand and messes around with one of the bikes. I’m watching her and smiling. She thanks for me inviting her and says she’ll come to the office Monday to start working again. I say bye and that I’ll see her Monday. I’m smiling all the way home. I’m feeling really good about this after all the ups and downs. She never brung up the screenshot and I didn’t mention it. Maybe I should have but it didn’t feel like the right time. I figured I would address another time. I just wanted to focus on having good time with her. When I got home I texted her saying I had a really fun time with her and would really like to this again. She didn’t respond. It’s now been a  week and she hasn’t said anything or come by the office. 

I’m very worried here. I feel like it went well and we left on a positive note. I thought she also had a good time. She made a point to tell me she’d see me Monday. Why do that if she didn’t have a good time? Did she think I just wanted to be friends and the follow up message changed things? I feel like it’s painfully clear I like her and want to spend time with her. I’m not sure what’s going on. I feel like she’s not sure what she wants, she’s still getting over her last relationship and maybe isn’t ready. I’m okay with that but I just wish she’d say something. I feel like I’m not asking her to be my girlfriend or even an actual date. I simply expressed I’d like to spend time with her again. Sorry for this very long post I’m just confused.

I've posted on a few different forums recently, I wanted to reach out as I seek advice, reassurance or hope...

A little about me recently. 35 Male, recently a 4 year relationship ended, I blame myself for this, however I know in brief moments of clarity I am not solely at fault.

The breakup was amicable, we both struggled with our mental health before and during the relationship. There was no betrayal or hate, but we slowly drifted apart and our problems grew to a point that made her realise she had to leave.

I've been suffering with chronic pain over the last few months, which adds further insult to injury. I'm holding on most days, but if it wasn't for my parents I don't know where I would be right now.

I feel lost, alone and scared of the future. I don't know who I am, what I want and how to move forward.

I've tried therapy, I do my best to practice mindfulness, I exercise (walk every day) which in itself is somewhat counterproductive, as I feel lonely in doing so, and often ruminate.

I currently attend group therapy each week, I've been to two sessions, plan to continue as it does help, albeit briefly.

Due to my age (mid 30s) my friends have busy lives, wives, kids, families to occupy themselves. I appreciate and accept this fact. Which has made it difficult to spend time with them in my times of need.

I'm also conscious, I don't want to be the 'depressed guy' that spews up misery, sadness and dispair every time we meet. I'm sure they have their own challenges, problems and battles they are working through.

Still, I can't help but feel hurt that some of them have been somewhat unavailable in recent weeks, for a simple walk, coffee or get together.

If anyone out there has felt, experienced or witnessed this first hand and made it through to the other side, please reach out.

Grapes. Just a pile of grapes. 

Coffee. Not pre-made. They're bringing beans and will use my pot to brew it. They are not bringing any sweeteners or other add ins. Just beans for black coffee. 

Smoothies. Again, not pre-made. But will be using my blender and ice and milk to blend their fruits into smoothies. While everyone is here. Making noise. 

A box of honey nut cheerios. To share like a dry chip type of situation in a bowl. 

Other guests are bringing more typical sides/snacks. The potluck is still going to be fun. But I am mildly annoyed.

9:03pm- took 2 miso under the tongue for 20 minutes because it dissolved easily. Taste: very chalky than the first dose

9:30pm- the intense cramps started which I can say 10/10. Nothing helps even the hot compress so I have no choice but to endure it. Chills and fever 

11:40pm- run to the bathroom because there's sudden rush of blood coming out from me---a lot of blood. I seated there for 20 minutes.

11:59pm- passed a 2 large blood clots

12:03 am- took 3rd dose of miso under the tongue for 20 minutes because it dissolved easily.

I decided not to take the 5th dose because I think my MA is complete already. 

After the procedure, I just took the whole day resting and sleeping because I think my body consumed a lots of energy during the process though I was still bleeding and passing small blood clots.

To those who will do it alone, prepare your mind and be calm so that you can monitor everything that is happening. Prepare also the things that you need like a lot of water, sanitary pads, blanket, make sure that your meds are complete, and also don't forget to eat or to prepare your food. But if you can have somebody with you throughout the process then it is much better.

I am 3 days post MA and I have a minimal bleeding to almost none. And currently dealing with my emotions. I am also grateful to wow because they answered all my queries and assisted me with the procedure.

Your self-esteem is so broken down by the abuse that you'll constantly second guess yourself, change everything about yourself, and do any and everything to please the narcissist.

**Manifestation**: The ""mask"" in manifestation is the ""start off small"", ""just test it out to build your belief"" type of manifestations that have a very high success rate because they're things that are very common and probable (climbing a ladder, free cookie, free coffee, seeing \[insert color\] car, etc.). 

By the time you successfully ""manifest"" seeing an orange car, you truly believe that you're creating your entire reality with your mind, so it only makes sense to go after things that are less probable and hold more significance to your life. When you try to manifest something you actually want, the manifestation ""mask"" falls off, and you get absolutely nowhere after following all the advice you were given to a tee. 

Instead of coming to the correct conclusion that you were lied to just so you could fund the lifestyles of manifestation coaches and authors, you start to doubt yourself and blame yourself for ""doing it wrong"". It doesn't even occur to you that manifestation just might be a fake concept because you saw an orange car, climbed a ladder, and got a text message from an old friend. The narcissistic assholes who teach manifestation for a living have you right where they want you. Because you have no self-assurance left, you'll spend years funding the lifestyles of manifestation gurus by trying to figure out ""what you're missing"". You'll watch endless videos, do 1:1 coaching session, buy courses, and join paid memberships hoping that it'll finally make a difference and bring you back to the ""golden age"" where you were getting free coffees and seeing yellow cars left and right. 

The same way that the only thing you can do when faced with a narcissist is leave them and go 100% no contact, the only thing you can do when faced with manifestation failure is leave the fake ideology behind and never look back.

1l6f4cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l6f4cm/this_has_been_bothering_me_a_lot_since_the_past/,This has been bothering me a lot since the past few weeks,"I (20M) have never been in a romantic relationship of any sort. People will say that “oh you’re still young….” Hear me out, during my teenage days and high school I never approached anyone at all (I had severe psoriasis which shattered my self esteem.. thankfully it’s in complete remission now) and then as I grew up, started working out and gained some confidence in life and I started to talk to strangers randomly and more often and yes that my shift from being an total introvert to slowly slowly becoming an extrovert (this was at age 18, during my final year at high school). I had begin to approach women a bit and compliment them and all that but that was only for me to increase my self esteem. Fast forward at September 2023, I starter college, first sem and there was this girl…. I liked her a lot and she had this girl next door sort of vibe and looked very innocent and cute and I quickly found her appealing. She thought I was from her country and all that but either way we exchanged Instagram and started talking and to be honest she was the first and so far only girl that has ever given me any sort of attention and made me felt something. She even told me once in the beginning that I look good in cap and I wore cap everyday for the rest of the semester lol.. I was your typical lover boy always spoke respectfully, always helped her in her assignments and we were pretty much in same class for every course, always helped her during the test as I would send her my answers. Long story short, in the end of the semester I found out that she was already dating this guy in my class and I never found out. Anyways I still continued to help her and during one of our final tests (which I taught her the subject and also to her then bf and they both passed ).. me, the bf, and one of our mutual friends were done with the test and came out. The guy took a picture of his answers and he gave me his phone and showed it to me on his phone and he walked off with our mutual friend and while I was looking at his answer on his phone, she texted and I accidentally opened the text and as soon as I opened the text the first thing I see is my name being mentioned. I quickly decide to read through a bit and find out that she never really cared about me. I remember I once was waiting for her but she told me to leave and I did and in the text her bf told her that I’m waiting for them and she said “It doesn’t matter I’ve told him to leave” and I’ve read other things like “it’s fine, he’ll teach us” and “Don’t tell him where we are”… the heartbreak and rejection I can take it, you can’t force anyone to love you but what truly broke me was that she used and threw me and never gave a single ounce of sh*t about me. Yeah I cut contact with her, her bf, and all that but I used to still see her from time to time in the campus and said hi and I said hi back. And I saw her once again last month and it was her last semester and she had graduated (I’m in a 3 year program and she’s in a 2 year one) and when she walked away I realized that this’ll be the last time I ever see her. Anyways after her (first semester) I did approach some women but it didn’t go anywhere at all and that begin to crumble whatever little confidence I had left little by little. And what has been bothering me a lot about the first couple of weeks is everytime I see a girl I would find attractive and it could be anywhere like campus, street, coffee shop, anywhere I get this little tightness on my chest that I wish I could approach her or that she was with me. I have went to this adult massage place twice in the meantime just to get a little relief from my sexual frustration cause I was feeling extremely lonely and frustrated..Now anytime I even think of approaching a woman and after so many rejections and it never going anywhere my mind consciously tells me “she’s not even that pretty”, “she looks like she has a ton of attitude leave her alone”, “out of your league”, “she’ll use you as well”, “it ain’t worth it”… and this has been bothering me a lot and I don’t know why tbh. It’s hard for me to approach or actually like someone deeply now cause I have been betrayed and used. And I have only said this to a few friends and mostly ChatGPT (yup I chat with ChatGPT and vent out cause I don’t want to bother others with my shjt).. Even though it’s been almost two years since that incident with the first girl happened and ended I wonder if I’m even over it or not.. and to be honest I don’t even know why I am posting it out over here.. anyways I hope I didn’t made it too long and yeah thanks to anyone that read 🙂",1,1749397163.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

First, I don't understand why they clog so easily. The surface area of the filter is a little smaller than with cones but something like the pulsar still has a pretty large diameter that you shouldn't have to be so extremely careful. 

At the same time people say that the pulsar can only brew large doses of coffee because otherwise the bed would be too shallow.

**Why This Pick?**

This game should see plenty of scoring, friends. Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw (5.17 ERA) hasn’t pitched more than 5 innings in any of his outings so far this season, which means the LA bullpen will likely make an early entrance. On the other side, St. Louis will start rookie Michael McGreevy – while his season debut was a good one, the Dodgers offense is bound to give him a run for his money in an effort not to get swept (for what would be just the second time this season). Despite the Under cashing for the first two games in this series, I’m on a high-scoring affair this afternoon.

## Key Features Analysis

The appeal of Yasso bars lies in their unique combination of taste, healthiness, and convenience. several key features contribute to their popularity.**Greek Yogurt Base:** The foundation of every Yasso bar is nonfat Greek yogurt.

This provides a creamy texture and a significant protein boost compared to conventional ice cream. Greek yogurt is known for its lower sugar and higher protein content, making it a healthier alternative. It also contributes to a longer feeling of fullness, which can be beneficial for those watching their weight or trying to manage cravings.

**Controlled Calorie Counts:** Each bar is carefully crafted to keep calorie counts within a reasonable range.

Yasso bars typically range from 80 to 150 calories per bar, a significant reduction compared to moast ice cream bars. This allows consumers to enjoy a sweet treat without derailing their dietary goals. The specific calorie count varies depending on the flavor, but Yasso maintains a consistent commitment to providing lower-calorie options.

1l6emsv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6emsv,Spotlight:  Wilderness Little Mombo/Mombo ; Review and AMA,"**TL;DR – Little Mombo  (Wilderness), Okavango Delta, Botswana (May 2025)**

Mombo—known as ""the place of plenty""—sits on Chief’s Island in the Moremi Game Reserve, right in the heart of the Okavango Delta, where wildlife is constant and the action begins the moment you arrive. Little Mombo, its more intimate sister camp, has just three suites and a quieter, more exclusive feel (great for a buyout) while still sharing the same same timeless design, exceptional guiding, and deep connection to the bush.  Game drives felt like stepping into a National Geographic documentary—wild dogs hunting, lions sprinting, even swimming, and leopards around every corner. The food was fantastic, the people were warm and genuine, and every detail felt personal. It’s pure Mombo magic—and a must for every serious safari enthusiast in their lifetime. 

**Location + Lodge-**

 Located on Chief’s Island in the heart of the Moremi Game Reserve in Botswana’s legendary Okavango Delta, is Mombo, the flagship Wilderness camp and one of the most famous camos across Africa and especially in safari circles.  Last month we were lucky enough to stay at it’s little sister….Little Mombo.

Little Mombo offers a more exclusive, intimate experience with only three suites, perfect for those seeking privacy and quiet luxury. Mombo is only a short walk away, and features eight suites and brings a touch more activity, while still embracing the serene spirit of the Delta.

The two camps are connected by elevated walkways, with one scenic bridge at Little Mombo and another leading into Mombo. This clever layout lets you wander between the camps while staying suspended above the bush—giving you a unique vantage point and an incredible sense of place. In between the two camps is a spa, currently under construction and set to open…. in about a week!!! Having had a sneak peak— it is going to be an amazing addition to the camp by elevating it’s wellness offerings and a wonderful spot for wellness in the wild! 

Both Mombo and Little Mombo are what I would described as rustic colonial chic—elegant without being overdone, and designed to make you feel fully at one with the surrounding landscape. While you’re safely elevated above the ground, there’s a beautiful openness to every space. With no barriers between you and nature, you’re connected to the rhythms and sounds of the bush.

One of the most fascinating aspects of this area is the contrast in terrain—it’s somehow wet and dry at the same time. Floodplains meet dry woodlands, creating a unique mosaic of habitats that draws in a rich variety of wildlife.

And then there’s the game. Mombo is famously known as “the place of plenty,” and it couldn’t be more true. From the moment you arrive, the action begins. Warthogs wander past your suite, buffalo graze just beyond the walkway, and a rotating cast of antelope keeps things lively. If you’re lucky, you might even witness a predator kill right from camp. While we didn’t catch one during our stay, it’s easy to see how it could happen—the bush is always alive, and Mombo puts you right at the center of it all.

**Suites-**

 The suites feel like something out of a David Livingstone-era safari—romantic, refined, and evocative of a bygone age, but with all the luxuries of today. At the heart of the space is a beautiful bed- paired with a generous sitting area and a well-appointed bureau bar—perfect for a quiet moment mid-day with a drink in hand. The bathroom is indulgent for a “tent”, with a striking freestanding copper bathtub and a stunning double rain shower. 

And then there’s the private balcony—an expansive outdoor living space that’s just as thoughtfully designed as the suite itself. You’ll find a plunge pool for cooling off, a massive in-built couch for lazy afternoon lounging, and a double lounger positioned perfectly for soaking in the views. It’s the kind of spot where time slows down, and you can simply watch the wild unfold in front of you. 

Just a heads-up that they don’t have true air conditioning. It’s more of a cool air system that blows over the bed—and honestly, it didn’t work all that well. The tent is open-air in style: doors are screened with wooden shutters, no glass, so you’re very much in a screened-in setup. The fans were decent, and it wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as I expected—but we were there during a cooler season. I *cannot* imagine staying here in the hotter months. That said, I’m really sensitive to heat—especially when it comes to sleeping—because I’m in surgical menopause. Others might find it totally fine, but it’s definitely something to be aware of.  It would not stop me from going back in any way shape or form, but I also personally probably wouldn’t stay here longer than 4 nights. 

 

**Amenities + Entertainment-**

Well, what can I say—they don’t call it “the place of plenty” for nothing!

Within the first two hours of our very first game drive at Little Mombo, we had already seen almost all of the Big Five (there are no rhinos here sadly post covid) —plus a few bonus surprises! One of the absolute highlights was an incredible wild dog sighting. A pack of about 11 wild dogs was on the hunt, and trailing them was a group of hyenas, waiting for a chance to swoop in. You could feel the tension building—and then came our first-ever Ferrari Safari!!!!

 The wild dogs spotted a male impala, and just like that, the chase was on—and so were we, flying across the bush in hot pursuit. While the dogs didn’t get the kill, the adrenaline rush was unreal. Hands down, one of the most thrilling experiences I’ve ever had in the wild and man, what a way to feel ALIVE! 

And it didn’t stop there. On our final game drive, we had another Ferrari Safari, this time with two male lions. A territorial dispute escalated, and one male suddenly chased the other at full speed across an open plain. I’ve never seen lions run like that in my life—and the best part? We kept up with them stride for stride. For a moment, it felt like we were running with the lions.   I will never ever forget that moment or that feeling.  

ALSO!  We saw a pride of lions swimming which was a total treat. 

All of these special moments wouldn’t have been possible without our phenomenal guide, ND. He was knowledgeable, passionate, and deeply invested in making sure every single drive was exceptional. He genuinely cared about our sightings, doing everything in his power to ensure we had the best experience possible each time we went out. ND made our safari unforgettable, and we’re so grateful for the incredible memories we made because of him.

Worth noting: because Mombo is located inside the Moremi Game Reserve, night drives aren’t allowed due to park regulations. That also means no walking safaris, no boating or mokoro activities, and no off-roading(*technically).* In practice, we were told that when a major sighting was happening—think big cats or something really special like wild dogs hunting—guides were allowed to go off-road to get us the best viewing and sightings. It wasn’t a free-for-all, but it did allow for some truly unforgettable moments

If things like mokoros or walking are high on your wish list, it’s definitely something to keep in mind—and another reason I always recommend pairing Mombo with a another camp for contrast and balance.



Dining-

 On our first night at camp, after returning from our evening game drive, we were treated to a boma dinner—it was something truly special.  I am not usually a huge boma dinner fan (having done them quite a bit) but it is important to go test them out for clients.  THIS one was worth every moment.

For those unfamiliar, a boma is traditionally an enclosed area used to protect livestock or serve as a communal gathering space in villages across Africa. At safari lodges, it transforms into a magical open-air dining experience, where guests gather under the stars and are welcomed into the heart of African culture and cuisine.

This particular boma dinner was one of the most heartfelt and memorable I’ve ever experienced. (I even have a video to prove it!) The food was served braai-style—that’s barbecue, the African way—and it was fresh, homey, and absolutely delicious.

But what really made the night shine was the staff’s warmth and spirit. They sang, danced, and shared stories about Botswana’s peaceful tribal history, where conflicts are resolved not through violence, but through dialogue—sometimes even over the course of weeks. It was so moving-it was so clear how proud each and every one of them were to be from Botswana and to welcome us personally..   It didn’t feel fake like other’s I have been to in the past—instead it felt precious --and because of that it was extremely touching and incredibly meaningful. 

And the thoughtful touches didn’t stop there. In the mornings they pack you a to-go breakfast called “jaffles”—essentially toasted sandwiches, but so much better. Hot, crispy, and filled with deliciousness, they were the perfect bite to enjoy out in the bush while watching the sun come up.  They were simple but SO satisfying and much more my style to be honest.  I love being able to grab coffee and go in the morning in the bush, I don’t like to waste a moment. 

 Not to be forgotten:  the lodge’s pizza oven! Yes, you can order pizza even if you're staying at Little Mombo—a brilliant touch, especially if you’re traveling with picky eaters who crave something familiar.



**Service-**

The service at Little Mombo was great—warm and personal. There was even a dedicated wine and beverage expert at the lodge, bursting with enthusiasm and ready to whip up anything you wanted.   I do think we bored him a little as we really just stuck to our normal sauv blanc and rose…. But he did create and AMAZING cocktail for us on the last night that blew us away.  

 Edward, the assistant manager, was fantastic—always present, helpful, and genuinely attentive. 

Housekeeping was quick—you'd head out for a drive and return to a perfectly refreshed suite without ever seeing anyone. 

One of my favorite parts? Making friends with a few of the lovely ladies on the property, who were determined to teach us how to ululate—that long, trilling, high-pitched sound that echoes through African celebrations. We gave it our best shot… and were hilariously bad at it. But it wasn’t for lack of trying, and the laughter we shared made it a highlight of the trip.

I truly loved every minute of my time here. I’m already dreaming of coming back with my family and couldn’t recommend it more highly.  The Mombo magic is not to be missed!!!!

\- I really love the new ""open map"", the zone is fun to explore, there are many rewards in it and it never feels samey imo (I think that the miasma adds a lot of character to the map), I hope they are going to add a ""mini zone"" every patch or 2  
\- Yi xuan is sooo cool, her gameplay is incredible and I hope every new dps character has the same complexity and feel she has (my main is harumasa btw lol)  
\- Hz storyline is very good and interesting, and the new threat after geppetto and nineveh seem interesting too (also orphie is cute)  
\-There is a loooooooot of stuff to do, I didnt even complete 30% of all the stuff to do, very happy about this, especially after 1.7 content drought  
\-Final boss is really fun and cool, also cool voice  
\-Free standard and engine are cool (thanks for the M2 lycaon for my hugo team)  
\-Mhhh porykroms

GOOD:  
\-Bangboo mecha event is really fun and I hope they continue doing experiments in event like this  
\-The new city area is very pretty and reminds me a lot of ""old"" hong kong and the hub is really well made without any loading screen, also the npc design is good  
\-The new character personalities are charming and the designs are pretty  
\-Cinema event seems really nice but its a bit too early to put it in very good  
\-New hz content is a lot and the revamped gears system adds more complexity to a previously very linear mode  
\-The Hz miasma dmg modifier is fun and makes healers viable in HZ  
\-The end of the story was really cool  
\-Miasma is fun and I dont get the negativity around it, it makes you learn the boss moveset so that you know when to dodge and gives me a dopamine rush every time I break it and I see that big chunk of dmg  
\-New enemies are cool and thank god they are different from the old ones and not a stupid reskin

MEH:  
\-The Hz time limit modifier is meh, maybe I wouldnt mind it if the resonia were better than they are rn, they really need to update the resonia (Withering Garden was better)  
\-Update UI is a mixed bag, the map is cool, the 3d map is awesome, but there are problems with the minimap on mobile, the wheel menu is pretty much useless and I cant see the trust events on the old menu (I can see them in the 3d map but still)  
\-New shiyu boss is ok? Nothing crazy but nothing bad either  
\-Dont like or hate the voices of the grunts in unvoiced dialogues so meh it is  
\-Don't really like the astra rerun with a strong character like yi xuan but I guess is a mix of greed and make astra available to the new player so...meh

BAD:  
\-Who tf had the idea of putting all those tutorials mid story, geez. I get it, there are a lot of new player that may skip 1.x and start from 2.0 so you need to tell them about the coffee, video store and you need to give them a ""city"" progression like the old video store but mid story? really? bruh, put a skip button there plz  
\-Its clear that the open map took a lot of the devs time, the early story has a lot of black screens and not many comic strips, I wont complain so much this time but I hope that it was bc of all the new additions to the game, I hope that 2.1 has more comic strips and maybe cutscene, but in general less black screens  
\-Performance issues, nothing that cant be fixed but...come on hoyo lol  
\-No story replay function from what Ive seen

STORY SCORE: 6/10  
ENDGAME SCORE: 8/10  
EVENTS SCORE: 8/10 (A bit early though)  
EXPLORATION SCORE: 9/10  
PERFORMANCE SCORE: 4/10  
REWARDS SCORE: 10/10

OVERALL EARLY FINAL SCORE: 7,5/10

I picked up a used ECP3630 on facebook marketplace and I'm having troubles with it. I can't get any flow from it at all. Even without the filter attached and just running water, it won't flow through, only drip. The steamer seems to work normally. Here are the things I've done:

Cleaned the water holder

Full descaling

Cleaned the diffuser - I unscrewed and removed it, it was heavily caked in coffee grounds. I scrubbed it until it was clean and put back in. Didn't make a difference.

This leads me to believe that it's an internal clog somewhere. Is that possible? Maybe I'm missing something? I'm pretty new to the espresso world and was trying to enter it cheaply - but if this isn't salvagable let me know!

1l6ehqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1l6ehqd/i_started_selling_drug_at_15_out_of_my_parents/,I started selling drug at 15 out of my parents house now turning 20 I’ll give you some content before you AMA,"I began selling weed at the age of 15. At the time, I was getting it for a decent price—$180 an ounce. The person I was working with fronted me two ounces to start and simply said, “Bring me back $350.” I sold it gram by gram, made $500, paid him back, and just like that, a business relationship was formed.

That arrangement lasted for about a year. Eventually, my parents found out. They weren’t furious—likely because they already knew I smoked—but they warned me not to get involved in anything harder. I listened, for a while. But tensions at home started building. We began fighting regularly, mostly over money they were taking from me. At the same time, they began letting strangers—mostly young men my age—stay in my room. At the time, I didn’t think much of it. Later, I’d learn the truth.

Frustrated, I started staying at friends’ places, bouncing from couch to couch. One night, I was with a friend who sold cocaine. He needed rest because he had school the next day, and asked if I wanted to “work his phone”—take care of his clients. I agreed, assuming it was just weed.

He handed me a bag, gave me prices, addresses, and told me what to expect. My first drop-off was just down the block. A customer pulled up, handed me a crisp $100 bill, asked where the regular guy was, took the bag, and drove off. That moment changed everything. I returned to my friend’s place, looked at that hundred, and knew I wanted more.

I worked the phone that whole night and made $1,500. I kept going for two more days until my friend had to leave town. Before he left, he gave me an ounce of coke and told me to do what I could with it. I started selling grams for $100 each and quickly realized how fast money moves in that world. Eventually, I began operating out of my parents’ house.

That’s when my mom started questioning how I had money for takeout every day. I told her the truth—I couldn’t keep lying. She told my dad, and that conversation changed everything. That’s when I learned my parents were addicted to crack. The people staying in my room weren’t just random guests—they were dealers sent from the city to trap out of our home, paying my parents in crack for a place to stay and work.

Then, my father—my actual father—taught me how to cook crack. He pulled out a small coffee pot, poured the cocaine in, added water, and waited until it turned crystal clear. Then he added baking soda. It instantly turned white. That’s when my coke turned to crack, and my role in the game changed.

He kept teaching me. One day, I tried cooking on my own, bragging about what I’d learned. I messed up—didn’t use enough baking soda—and lost a whole ounce down the sink. A painful lesson.

This life continued for about a year: cooking, selling, making money, and constantly getting robbed by my own parents. I had no stable place to go. My home had become a trap house. I was making $2,000 a night, $20,000 a month. But behind the money was chaos, betrayal, and no peace. Eventually, I had a serious falling out with my parents and walked away.

Now, I'm still in the game, still selling—but things are different. I’m $100,000 up. I work smarter, more discreetly, and deal with regular, functional clients instead of addicts. I’ve learned a lot—about business, survival, and the streets—but I also know this lifestyle comes with consequences. I’m not glorifying it. I’m just telling the truth. There so much more I could say but I don’t wanna open a whole story on it made another time

You stupid bitch, you ruined my life! Mrs. Sands, wait!"" Zoe cried, holding her hands in front of her face as she desperately tried to back up in her small cubicle only to bang into the cheap off-white colored plastic wall, leaving her with nowhere to go and a seriously pissed off woman holding the extra large iced coffee Zoe bought ten minutes earlier, coming her way. ""Please don't .Her words were cut off by a stunned gasp as twenty-four freezing ounces of her much needed caffeine fix hit her in the face, neck, and chest, instantly drenching her. You'll pay for what you did!"" Mrs. Sands screamed, pulling her hand back to slap Zoe. Thankfully someone, probably Mr. Sands, already called security and the two large burly guys that she passed every morning in the downstairs lobby grabbed Mrs. Sands and yanked her back before she could make good on the murderous glare she was sending Zoe's way. Bitch!"" Mrs. Sands screamed, kicked, and screeched as she was carried off the tenth floor. With a shaky hand, Zoe reached out and grabbed her wobbly office chair and carefully sat down, making sure to keep most of her weight off the front left side wheel. When the chair didn't collapse and deposit her ass on the floor, again, she counted herself lucky. I told you to keep your mouth shut,"" John, the office ass\*\*le, said in a bored tone as he walked past Zoe's cubicle. Yeah, he really had and she was kicking herself for not listening to him when she had the chance. With a groan she dropped her face into her hands and wondered if anyone would notice if she left work a little early today. Of course they would, she thought miserably. The penny pinching management watched their employees like hawks, never missing a thing and ready to swoop in and attack at the slightest blunder.  
  
  She'd lost count of how many times she'd been written up for ""excessive office supply waste"" for not reusing paper clips, leaving her computer running for two minutes while she used the bathroom, throwing away paper that could be used again no matter what was printed on it, and her absolute favorite, using more than one staple on a packet. If she tried to leave even one minute early they'd know and for the next week they'd double her workload to get back the time they believed she owed them.  
  
  After three long years she was too tired to argue or care. At this point she was resigned to come in at eight-thirty on the dot and put in eight and half hours and work through her unpaid lunch break as was required and then go home to the new hell that she was beginning to hate.  
  
  Two months ago when her landlord unceremoniously evicted her so that his eighteen year old daughter and her thirty-two year old boyfriend could have her apartment, she'd been desperate to find a decent apartment that she could afford on her meager salary.  
  
  When she found a beautiful two level townhouse located in a decent neighborhood for two hundred dollars less than her old apartment she'd been ecstatic and snatched it up quickly, hoping that it was a sign that maybe things were going to start looking up for her. Of course she really should have known better since nothing in life ever seemed to go her way.  
  
  The first clue should have been when she found out the other tenant in the two family townhouse was the landlord's nephew. Over the years she'd dealt with that situation enough that she really should have known better. In her experience landlord's relatives were ruder, louder, and had a huge sense of entitlement, making the rest of the tenants' lives a living hell. She learned early on not to complain to the landlord when his or her kid had all night parties, had shouting matches until three in the morning, or when their grandkids detonated water balloons in her mailbox. The result just wasn't worth it.  
  
  So when her new neighbor, Trevor Bradford, parked his pickup truck halfway into her parking spot, leaving her with no choice but to park on the street and risk a parking ticket, she shut her mouth and sucked it up, knowing complaining would do little good. Whenever he did something to piss her off like steal her paper, blast his television, or track mud into their small hallway and all over her cute welcome mat with puppies, she bit her lip and kept her mouth shut, reminding herself that even with the jerk next door the townhouse was still the best place she'd ever lived in.  
  
  ""What are you still doing here?"" a harsh voice demanded.  
  
  Zoe looked up, half-afraid that she'd find Mrs. Sands standing there ready for round two. Instead she found the woman's husband, Mr. Sands standing in her cubicle opening, glaring at her with open disgust. That was a little unexpected considering she was the one who realized that five million dollars had been embezzled over the past six years and found the proof that linked Mrs. Sands to the theft. Then again she could certainly understand why he was in such a pissy mood since his wife had just screwed him over.  
  
  ""I asked why you're still here, Miss. O'Shea. Your employment was terminated an hour ago. I expected you to leave immediately,"" he said coldly.  
  
  ""W-what?"" Zoe asked, jumping to her feet quickly, too quickly. Her chair fell back with a loud groan and two of the wheels popped off and rolled off somewhere beneath her desk. ""Why am I fired?""  
  
  It didn't make any sense. Most bosses would appreciate finding out that someone had stolen from them, right? She didn't expect them to be happy, but grateful wouldn't exactly hurt, especially right now.  
  
  With a drawn out sigh, Mr. Sands gestured for one of the security guards who'd dragged Mrs. Sands away to step forward. Zoe automatically took a nervous step back.  
  
  ""Please remove her before she destroys any more company property,"" Mr. Sands ordered, stepping away.  
  
  Destroying company property? With a frown she looked down at the chair that had given her nothing but problems over the past three years and by this point consisted mostly of duct tape. Before she could tell him that the chair was given to her already broken the large security guard had her by the arm and her worn black purse in the other hand and was dragging her towards the elevator.  
  
  ""Hey!"" she said, desperately trying to dig her feet into the cheap paper-thin carpet. ""Why am I being fired?"" she asked, reaching out to grab the wall of one of the cubicles only to have the security guard yank her away. She grabbed another wall. Damn cheap plastic walls, she thought as her hand slipped off the cubicle wall. ""I don't understand why you're firing me. I'm not the one that stole!"" she cried as she was dragged into the elevator. She reached out and slapped her hands against the edge of the elevator door to stop the doors from closing so she could get her answer.  
  
  Mr. Sands shrugged. ""Because you should have found it sooner,"" he said, leaving her absolutely stunned.  
  
  Her hands dropped away, allowing the elevator doors to close and her world to crumble.  
  
  What the hell was she going to do now?  
  
  ""I would have kept my mouth shut,"" the security guard mumbled.  
  
  Zoe sighed unhappily. ""I really am an idiot. ""  
  
  ""Yup. ""  
  
  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
  
  ""Please, please, don't be in my spot,"" Zoe chanted softly as she slowly turned the corner, wishing she knew how to change or at least temporarily fix her windshield wipers as she did her best to squint through the heavy downpour.  
  
  A moment later she slowly stopped in front of her house. . . . at least she thought it was her house. With a small groan, she pressed the button to roll down the driver's side window and tried not to cringe when the window emitted its usual grinding noise. Once it was down, Zoe leaned out the window and tried to make out the color of the townhouse, pale blue, not hers, but at least she now knew that she only had two more houses to go.

 Just as she was pulling back, a car sped past her, crashing through a large puddle and further soaking Zoe. This day could not get any worse, she thought, wiping mud out of her eyes and jumping when somebody behind her blasted the horn. With a resigned sigh she started driving once again, but apparently not fast enough for the people behind her, who accompanied her twenty yard drive with continuous horn blasting.  
  
  After the day she had she wasn't too surprised to find Trevor's pickup truck parked in the middle of their short double wide driveway. With a groan she did her best to park across the street, trying to ignore the cars that sped past her, telling her off, and adding a special blast of the horn just in case she didn't quite get the message the first time.  
  
  When she tried to close the window she received another little surprise when the window slid up noiselessly. Well, that's a relief, she thought, grabbing her purse and climbing out of the car. She was really afraid she'd have to pay three hundred dollars to have her windows fixed, again. She closed the door and turned to walk across the street when an odd swooshing sound caught her attention.  
  
  Praying that is was just her imagination, Zoe turned around and frowned. Why did her window look weird? She pushed her wet hair out of her face and leaned forward to get a better look. It didn't take long before she realized that her window had come off its tracks.  
  
  She wiped her wet hands on her soaked skirt and gripped the edge of the window and tried to pull it up only to have the window slip through her hands and slide further down.  
  
  ""Oh no you don't,"" she muttered, dropping her purse and grabbing the window and doing her best to yank it back up. The last thing she needed was for the window to slide down into the door where it would have to stay until she could scrounge up the money to have it fixed. With no job and no prospects that wasn't happening any time soon and since there was a very good chance that she'd be living out of her car soon she wanted to keep it dry and mold free.  
  
  It took several minutes, but she managed to pull the window up several inches. One last pull should do it, she decided, gripping the window tightly and pulling as hard as she could. When the window slid up easily she couldn't help but chuckle. Finally things were-  
  
  Her hands slipped and before she could grab the window it slid down quickly into the door and if the noise that followed was any indication, cracked. She stared numbly at the empty window for a long moment before she picked up her purse, not at all surprised when the strap broke off, or when the heel on her left shoe snapped off a minute later.  
  
  Clutching her ruined purse to her chest, she wobbled towards the front door, only getting stuck in the mud twice and losing one shoe, the right one, before she found herself on the front stoop, searching her purse for her keys. By the time she found them she was shivering violently from the cold and close to crying for the first time in five years.  
  
  She opened the door, spotted her now mud caked puppy welcoming mat and let herself into her apartment, praying that her next door neighbor took it easy on her tonight since she really wasn't sure that she could handle much more.  
  
  Doing her best not to ruin her landlord's carpeting, she made her way over to the phone, deciding that she needed the ultimate pickup after the day she had. She knew she shouldn't, especially since she would have to live off what little savings she had, but she just couldn't help herself. She called up Black Jack's Pizzeria and ordered the special, a two liter bottle of Coke, a large order of chicken fingers with extra honey mustard sauce, and an extra large, extra thick Chicago style pizza called, The Monster.  
  
  For once the customary one hour wait for delivery didn't bother her. She pulled off her mud soaked shoe and stockings and made her way upstairs to her bedroom and grabbed a change of clothes as she headed for the bathroom, praying that her surprisingly quiet neighbor remained that way.  
  
  She quickly pulled off her soaked, coffee stained, and mud splattered skirt suit and looked it over. As long as she pretreated it and got it into the wash tonight it should be fine, at least she hoped it would. She didn't exactly have the funds needed to go out and buy a new suit for job interviews. This one, with the aid of many interchangeable blouses, had lasted for three years and she'd been counting on it to last another two.  
  
  After a five minute search she found her bottle of generic stain pretreatment behind the box of condoms she bought, what was it now? Three years ago? Or was it five? The realization that she hadn't had sex in over five years was rather depressing, she thought, tossing the condoms back under the bathroom sink so she wouldn't have to look at the depressing reminder that her love life, social life, and professional life just plain sucked.  
  
  She liberally sprayed her suit, only wondering if the pretreatment chemical would harm her suit after she sprayed it. Knowing her luck, the chemical would probably chew through the imitation silk shirt and stain the suit jacket with large weird shaped polka dots.  
  
  With a resigned sigh, she left the suit on the sink counter and climbed into her bathtub and turned on the shower. For the first time all day she felt herself relax. She stood beneath the hot spray for several minutes just enjoying the hot water before she applied shampoo to her hair.  
  
  A loud squeal escaped her as the water pressure suddenly dropped and the water went from comfortably hot to excruciatingly hot in seconds. Startled, she jumped back, slipped, landed on her butt, and cringed as shampoo seeped into her eyes.  
  
  ""Ow, ow, owie!"" she mumbled frantically as her eyes began to burn and her butt throbbed. She wasn't entirely sure which one bothered her more at the moment, but she knew which one she could fix.  
  
  Taking a deep breath, she shoved her head under the hot water, silently cursing the low water pressure that was actually pushing more soap into her closed eyes. At least the water began to cool, she thought on a sigh before she squealed again seconds later when the water went ice cold and she was forced to stand up, hoping that would help the still low water pressure rinse her hair out faster.  
  
  It didn't.  
  
  Gasping, she ran her fingers through her long thick hair and tried to hurry the process. Minutes later she was jumping out of the shower and cursing the bastard next door for not only flushing the toilet, but for taking a shower at the same time as her. The least the jerk could have done when he realized that she was also taking a shower was wait for her to finish.  
  
  Still grumbling five minutes later and thankfully dressed in warm clothes, Zoe grabbed her basket of dirty laundry, a roll of quarters and her damn near empty bottle of laundry detergent and headed downstairs. Unfortunately she didn't have a private entrance to the basement so she was forced to balance her basket of laundry while she did her best not to step in one of the dozen or so mud splotches that decorated the hallway floor.  
  
  She walked to the door at the end of the small hallway and flicked on the light switch for the stairs all while hoping that the jerk hadn't tracked mud down the stairs, because she really didn't need to fall on her ass again tonight. Zoe sighed in relief when she spotted the clean pine stairs and headed down them to the small laundry room.  
  
  It wasn't until she placed her basket on the washing machine that she realized that she'd forgotten her suit. She half-debated leaving it for another day, but she didn't want to take the chance of landing an interview tomorrow and having nothing to wear but jeans.  
  
  With a tired sigh, she left her basket and headed upstairs. At least she had Black Jack's pizza to comfort her later, she reminded herself.

Sometimes I’d literally be on my way to see her and she’d tell me, “Don’t come, my room’s messy.” [Part 2]","Second part with more details? Do you still have the same opinion?

Since the beginning, when I first met my ex, she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. After some time, we had a video call, but she didn’t want to show herself—she never did—always saying her hair was messy. Later, I found out from her that she had autism.

Our conversations were kind of one-sided. We once planned to meet at the park, but she canceled, saying she had hurt her leg. She also said I was treating her differently after she told me she had autism. She told me her ex had abandoned her, and that she had been seeing another guy who ended up replacing her.

One day, after I got robbed and almost lost her number, I noticed she didn’t seem to care much—she was indifferent and even told me she wouldn’t message me if I didn’t message her first. She used to talk to me about her cats and how her nephews had autism. She once got really mad when her cousin said she used to drink with her ex.

After a while, I invited her to go to the movies because she had said we never did anything together. At first, she said she wouldn’t go because she was embarrassed. But after I insisted, she agreed—only to later say, “Wouldn’t it be better if we were just friends?” Still, we ended up going. We met there, bought some candy, kissed during the movie, and spent the afternoon being affectionate.

She never let me see her phone, was always very reserved, and didn’t give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall and she gave me a chocolate. We ended up going to a motel, and when we got there, she said she was embarrassed and couldn’t have the lights on. I told her it was fine, but she quickly became reactive and her mood changed. We stayed there anyway and then went home.

Before that, we had gone to the park, kissed a bit, and when she was about to head home, I offered to walk her back. It was weird because she made it pretty clear she didn’t want me to meet her family. I walked her anyway and went home afterward.

Another episode happened when her sister came to drop her off at my place. I said something like “we never go out because she always makes excuses,” and she got really angry with me that day.

We once played a game together, and when I criticized it, she got mad and stopped playing. Still, she brought me chocolate afterward, we spent time together, and then she started talking about breaking up.

She invited me to a party, said we’d go together, then changed her mind and said she wouldn’t go. Later, she changed her mind again and said she would go. I got frustrated and asked if she didn’t want me there. I told her I’d go anyway and asked if I could arrive a bit early. She made it very clear I could only show up at 6 PM.

I arrived a little earlier, and her sister saw me on the street and invited me up. We ended up going to one of her friend’s parties, where she introduced me as her boyfriend. Then out of nowhere she said, “Let’s download an app to find you a hot girl?”

After that, we went back to her place, and she wanted me to sleep over, but I ended up going home.

After all of this, I called her and broke up. She started crying and blocked me. Later, she told me I had sent her into a mental health crisis (CAPS, in Brazil) and took away her happiness. But after some time, she messaged me saying she missed me more than she thought she would. So, we started talking again.

While we were reconnecting, I found her on a dating app. When I brought it up, she told me to “just find someone else.” I got angry and questioned her. She said she was looking for her friend’s ex on the app.

In the end, I told her I loved her. She replied that she had gone somewhere and wished I had been there. Then she called me and invited me to her mother’s birthday party. I didn’t go. Her mom called me afterward and asked if I loved her. Then she invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again, but she told me her dad was really mad at me. I got upset and ended up venting online. She saw it and accused me of deceiving and using her. She said she only acted the way she did because she was insecure and autistic, that she had prayed for me every day, and then she blocked me again and disappeared.

I would like to thank anyone who can provide advice.

1l6ebj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episcopalian/comments/1l6ebj9/went_to_my_first_episcopal_service/,Went to my first Episcopal service,"And it sucked. For me, anyway. 

I simultaneously did and did not want to be there. Why? Well, I’m a drunk who’s only two days sober and everyone in the AA meetings I go to is religious (or, at the very least, spiritual and believe in some form of a higher power) and always urges people “If you can’t get to a meeting, go to a church and pray”. Well, there’s none around me that are open on days other than Sunday. But I did want to at least try something. 

So why choose an episcopal church over all other denominations? Well, I guess it’s mainly because their values and general progressiveness tend to align with me pretty well, being open to literally everyone and all that. I see it as a diet version of Catholicism, and I know I would never fit in as a Catholic. 

I wouldn’t say I’m glad I went, but also wouldn’t say I regret it. I didn’t participate at all and just sat there quietly. I didn’t even stand up for singing and prayer. Just sat like a lump on a log and wanted to drink more than anything. That, and my frustration slowly built up as the toddlers around me kept complaining about whatever bullshit a toddler can even complain about, making it hard to focus on the sermon (although, I did sit in the back so maybe that’s on me). And then when the service ended and everyone was gathered for a free breakfast and coffee and all that, I walked out without talking to anyone. I also didn’t feel anything holy or spiritual (though you’ll all probably say that’s also on me for not “opening my heart”). 

I don’t know. This is a pointless post, I know. I don’t even know if I’ll stick to sobriety as I don’t really want to stop anyway. I don’t want to be here and am only living for my family’s sake. And as for the church, even if I did get involved and volunteered with stuff, I wouldn’t get close to anyone and would only be doing it to fill my time or stay away from home and from booze.

I’m on 25mg of XR adderall. I don’t take it every day, probably 4-5x a week. Sometimes, I feel like it’s working. I’m super motivated and focused. But other times it’s like I don’t feel it at all, and it’s more like I had a cup of coffee. And on rare occasions, it sometimes feels like too much to the point where food repulses me and I’m anxious. Im prescribed IR too and have similar experiences where the effects seem like they vary.  What gives? Why don’t I have a consistent experience with the same medication I’ve been taking for ~5 years? I’ve never really had a consistent sleep schedule for a number of reasons, does this play a role? What can I do?

Honest review 
I’ve only cruised one other time with NCL on the joy. So I don’t have much to compare too. 

Embark was easy - we arrived at 10 and we were on the ship by 11:30. 
We were Aurera however when we checked in and got cards the agent didn’t realize this (due to being new and training) and failed to give us our priority boarding info and about  the lunch at Waves. 
Muster was a shit show. They have you watch the video, call the number and then everyone has to go and meet at their spots. Kind of mayhem and some inconsiderate people literally stopped in the middle to take pics and hug. Like what? 😭

Food- everything I had I enjoyed and or loved. Buffet food was actually very very good. The pizza is as good as people say. The only meal I hated was breakfast at the buffet. But I don’t love breakfast so don’t go by me on that. You have to get to buffet when it opens or you will be in literal hell any other time. Again people stopping in the middle or taking forever to scoop their chicken 😂. 
We did Butchers Cut - very very good. Filet Mignon was amazing. It was my bday and they even sang to me lol. 
We also did Hola! Not worth a speciality meal credit, but ok other wise. 

We did the wine and cheese pairing. Not sure it was worth the money, but we got wine and cheese out of it.  

Vibe and atmosphere -
Modern and fun. The night parties very fun. White night had to be the best one. The silent disco is so fun but it gets very very crowded and the line is insane to get headphones. It moved pretty quick. 
I’ll never ever understand why they try to put 3600+ people in one small-ish area for these big parties. Only Tropical and white were at the pool. 

Bars - a lot of them! Edge and sky lounge were my vibe. Edge has the best iced coffee which made our drink package even more worth it. Sky Lounge was a great night time chill vibe. I liked it because it’s adults only and nice after a day full of kids and chaos. They had excellent bar tenders and a piano player nightly. 

Shows- all shows at Broadway theatre were excellent. Carousel although not free is worth every single penny I believe. We did both shows and loved them both. The Comedian was excellent as well. We did the adults only and they were making under age folks show ID and I saw them turn down anyone not of age - even if with a parent. 

The last night was really fun. The cast and crew are all around to take pics, get everyone’s name who you loved so you can remember them when doing your review. 

Disembarking was kind of a 💩 show and I swear this morning always makes me anxious. We had Aurera and were off by 7:45 and home by 9. 
Finding our bags wasn’t terrible. 
If you like to fight crowds and have more patience buffet was jam packaged. I just skipped. 

Overall I’d give this a strong 7.5/10. We weren’t too happy with embarkation and the people signing us in as Aurera when we paid for it. The doors being broken and waiting hours for it to be fixed was a tad annoying. Once the bumps were taken care of it was a great cruise. People will be people - but the staff and entertainment was really amazing. I’ll book MSC for sure in the future. ",4,1749394954.0,Cruises,0,1.0,False

I (M/26) had been with my fiancée (F/26) for almost three years. We had our ups and downs, but I think she was toxic from the start or has other deep-seated problems. I hoped that would change, but it never did. During arguments, it eventually became “normal” for her to deeply insult or humiliate me; “id\*ot” was still a mild insult. She used the concerns and feelings I shared with her against me during arguments and made fun of them. The worst was when she used physical violence against me; she kicked me, hit me, and ultimately dug her fingernails into my arm. I still have scars on my arm from that. Of course I couldnt really defend myself, because then I would be the ""bad man"" that ""hit"" a woman or something like that. In general, everything was my fault, I was “incompetent,” “unmanly,” or even “annoying.” The arguments could escalate extremely on her part, but then she would cool down and come back in tears and say she would change when I said I couldn't take it anymore. After a short time, everything was my fault again... At some point, I kept my mouth shut so that I could just have some peace and quiet.

Sometimes she would quickly lose her temper because of “her life” and hit herself (but we don't live badly by any means and we very rarely have money worries).

The argument where I said I was ending the relationship escalated so much on her part that she packed all my clothes into garbage bags, soaked my shoes, threw her engagement ring in the trash, and salted my coffee things (and other things). Then she drove away and didn't come back to our shared apartment until the next day. Before I said I didn't want any of this anymore, she texted me that the relationship was over and blocked me everywhere. The reason for this was that I had to put my family up in the apartment for a few hours (hotel checkout was at 11 a.m., their train left at 6 p.m.) the next day because a storm was forecast. She wouldn't accept that, saying I was crossing her “boundaries.” After that, she cried terribly and wanted me to take her back. She did all this while my family was visiting me and I was staying with them in their hotel room. My family saw everything when I was at the apartment and said that things couldn't go on like this and that it was all a sign that she didn't care about anything.

Now the problem is that we have a shared apartment and I'm afraid that she might do something, at least during the “break-up” phase, even though she's still hoping that I'll change my mind. I can't just go to my parents' house because my work prevents me from doing so and they live far away.

How can I get out of this relationship as smoothly as possible, as well as out of the situation with the apartment? I don't know what to do.",27,1749394745.0,Advice,66,0.97,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best silicone keyboard covers boast a combination of durability, precision, and comfort, each contributing to an enhanced user experience and superior protection.

**Material Quality:** The quality of silicone used is paramount.Premium silicone is flexible, durable, and resistant to tearing. It should have a smooth, non-sticky surface for comfortable typing. In the best covers, the silicone is also treated to be anti-static, preventing dust accumulation. High-grade silicone should also be non-toxic and odorless.

**Precision Fit:** A well-designed keyboard cover precisely conforms to the contours of each key, ensuring minimal interference with typing. This requires accurate measurements and molding techniques to match the specific keyboard model. A precise fit prevents the cover from shifting during use and maintains the keyboard's original tactile feel.

**Thickness and Elasticity:** Optimal thickness provides sufficient protection without substantially altering the typing experience. Too thick, and the keys feel mushy. Too thin, and the cover offers inadequate protection. High elasticity allows the cover to stretch slightly, conforming perfectly to the keyboard and ensuring a snug fit. It also contributes to the cover's resistance to tearing or deformation over time.

**Transparency and Visibility:** A high degree of transparency is crucial for maintaining the legibility of the keyboard's characters. Clear silicone allows the backlighting, if present, to shine through, enhancing visibility in low-light environments. Some covers also feature printed characters that match the original keyboard layout, further improving clarity.

**Washability and Maintenance:** Silicone keyboard covers should be easily washable with soap and water,allowing for speedy and convenient cleaning. The material should be resistant to discoloration and degradation from cleaning agents. Proper maintenance ensures the cover remains hygienic and extends its lifespan.

Key features that can be expected from the best Silicone Keyboard Covers in 2025 include:

* Premium-grade silicone construction
* Ultra-thin profile for minimal typing interference
* Anti-static and dust-resistant surface
* Precise molding for specific keyboard models
* Washable and easy-to-clean material

I’ve just moved to Germany from Czech and currently living not far from Regensburg and I’m trying to find a job, but I only speak very basic German. I can understand some things and say simple phrases, but I’m definitely not fluent yet.

Does anyone have tips on:
What kind of jobs might be available for someone in my situation?
Which websites or agencies are best for finding these types of jobs?
Is it better to just walk into places and ask in person?
How much German is usually needed for basic labor jobs?

1l6e0nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1l6e0nq/i_hope_youre_happy/,I hope you're happy,"All I've ever wanted was your happiness and health. I was always so afraid on the days you were feeling low, that I was contributing, or not doing enough to pull you out of it. I asked what I could do or if it was me and you always reassured me it wasn't. If it had been me, I want to believe i would've worked hard to change what I was doing, because even though i wasn't an easy partner at times, my love for you was so genuine and real. 

No longer being with you has been incredibly painful, but not nearly as painful as thinking that perhaps you look back and feel relief from being away from me. I certainly remember the hard times, but they are dwarfed by the feeling I had when you'd come up behind me and hug me while I cooked. They pale in comparison to being woken up by your kiss and the smell of coffee. They dissappear when I think about the times we laughed so hard we couldn't breathe for minutes. Someone says your name and I think of you dancing like no one is watching in the middle of a crowd of people, and me standing watching and thinking, ""she's so beautiful"".

I hope I'm wrong, I hope you have fond memories too and I wasn't just all the reasons you weren't happy. If I was, then I wish I was communicated with so I could be given opportunities to fix that. I wish I had been given time to change or show you that I cared. I still care, and if there was nothing I could've done other than not be with you, then I'm glad you got away from me. I love you more than you'll ever know, and I want your happiness no matter what it costs me in return. Please take my happiness so you can have yours.

Been practicing writing a lil bit so I thought I'd share this here :)  
  
I’ve spent years letting “organise the flat” sit on every Sunday’s to-do list, only to watch my ADHD brain treat it like background noise. Last month I decided to run a little experiment: combine James Clear’s Atomic Habits micro-change philosophy with Todoist’s labels, filters and reminders.

Here’s what actually worked:

1. **Shrink the habit to two-minute clean-ups.** Clear says “make it obvious and easy”; I created a “🎯 2-Min Tidy” label. Any task that can be done during a kettle boil goes here.
2. **Stack the cue onto an existing routine.** “Put mugs in dishwasher” now lives right after “brew coffee” in my Morning filter, so the app pings the moment steam hits the cup (it doesn't have to be this granular but it serves as an example for sequential tasking / task stacking).
3. **Use visual scores for dopamine.** I built a “Streaks” filter that shows only tasks tagged `home` AND `completed <24 h`. Watching the list shrink is increasingly satisfying lool.
4. **Automate “out of sight” zones.** Once-a-week recurring tasks for drawers, cables and that evil junk basket mean I never rely on memory (which, being honest, is on permanent lunch break).
5. **Celebrate loudly, reset quietly.** When I hit 7 clean days the project board turns green; if I miss, it just resets no shame spiral n all that.

I wrote up the full picture on my blog if you fancy a deeper dive: [Full breakdown here](https://baizaar.tools/adhd-home-organization-todoist/).

**Early results:**  
• 20 minutes saved per day hunting for stuff, which I find a stressful mode to be in.  
• Zero “where’s my charger?” meltdowns in two weeks, thank fuck.  
• A partner who now calls the desk “surprisingly civilised”—I’ll take that win.

**TL;DR**: By grafting Atomic Habits’ small-change framework onto Todoist labels & filters, I turned home organisation from an ADHD nightmare into a low-friction routine. ",8,1749394121.0,BettermentBookClub,3,0.91,False

I've been approached by a designer who wants to use the 20 mm Taj Mahal on the island. The island is 5m long. It will be a joint in there... But they want to have it as a wave-type of join. like in the photo. The blue wavy line. I'm very tempted to say F\*\* off to them, but first wanted to know if you guys have ever done anything like that. Cutting, I don't see a problem, but it's a question of how risky when transporting and joining...   
Thanks in advance for all your input.

This weekend I am helping my mom with her moving sale. Shes got a TON of items she's bought and saved in the last 6 years for when I ""finally have a kid"". She is putting them in the yard sale because she's ""waited long enough and its time to move on"". (Mind you there are two other grandchildren  my sibs have given her...)

She got absolutely confrontational and flabbergasted when i pulled out a book im reading called ""Living the life unexpected"" which is a book my therapist suggested I pick up and read. Its clearly a book about living past infertility and finding meaning in life again. We are still TTC but feel like we are near the end of the journey. I caught her flipping through it a couple times. 

This. Whole. Weekend. Has been very triggering. Going through my.old baby items and helping pack. Pulling out baby items to sell. Everything. 

I finally lost my shit over a pack and play. I went to set it up and couldn't figure out how to open it. It taunted me. It felt like the universe screaming ""YOU CANT FIGURE THIS OUT BECAUSE YOU WOULD NEVER MAKE IT AS A MOM""

My cousin with three kids came over and flicked the pack and play open in 10 seconds after she saw i was struggling. My mom made a comment about my cousins ""experience"" with little kids. I just started crying and said I needed coffee. I got in my car and left for an hour. 

I am usually pretty good at protecting my peace. Yesterday I just lost it. Completely.

1l6dvyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Discussion/comments/1l6dvyw/20_early_review/,2.0 Early review,"Just finished a good chunk of the early 2.0 content, my opinions on it:

VERY GOOD:  
\- I really love the new ""open map"", the zone is fun to explore, there are many rewards in it and it never feels samey imo (I think that the miasma adds a lot of character to the map), I hope they are going to add a ""mini zone"" every patch or 2  
\- Yi xuan is sooo cool, her gameplay is incredible and I hope every new dps character has the same complexity and feel she has (my main is harumasa btw lol)  
\- Hz storyline is very good and interesting, and the new threat after geppetto and nineveh seem interesting too (also orphie is cute)  
\-There is a loooooooot of stuff to do, I didnt even complete 30% of all the stuff to do, very happy about this, especially after 1.7 content drought  
\-Final boss is really fun and cool, also cool voice  
\-Free standard and engine are cool (thanks for the M2 lycaon for my hugo team)  
\-Mhhh porykroms

GOOD:  
\-Bangboo mecha event is really fun and I hope they continue doing experiments in event like this  
\-The new city area is very pretty and reminds me a lot of ""old"" hong kong and the hub is really well made without any loading screen, also the npc design is good  
\-The new character personalities are charming and the designs are pretty  
\-Cinema event seems really nice but its a bit too early to put it in very good  
\-New hz content is a lot and the revamped gears system adds more complexity to a previously very linear mode  
\-The Hz miasma dmg modifier is fun and makes healers viable in HZ  
\-The end of the story was really cool  
\-Miasma is fun and I dont get the negativity around it, it makes you learn the boss moveset so that you know when to dodge and gives me a dopamine rush every time I break it and I see that big chunk of dmg  
\-New enemies are cool and thank god they are different from the old ones and not a stupid reskin

MEH:  
\-The Hz time limit modifier is meh, maybe I wouldnt mind it if the resonia were better than they are rn, they really need to update the resonia (Withering Garden was better)  
\-Update UI is a mixed bag, the map is cool, the 3d map is awesome, but there are problems with the minimap on mobile, the wheel menu is pretty much useless and I cant see the trust events on the old menu (I can see them in the 3d map but still)  
\-New shiyu boss is ok? Nothing crazy but nothing bad either  
\-Dont like or hate the voices of the grunts in unvoiced dialogues so meh it is  
\-Don't really like the astra rerun with a strong character like yi xuan but I guess is a mix of greed and make astra available to the new player so...meh

BAD:  
\-Who tf had the idea of putting all those tutorials mid story, geez. I get it, there are a lot of new player that may skip 1.x and start from 2.0 so you need to tell them about the coffee, video store and you need to give them a ""city"" progression like the old video store but mid story? really? bruh, put a skip button there plz  
\-Its clear that the open map took a lot of the devs time, the early story has a lot of black screens and not many comic strips, I wont complain so much this time but I hope that it was bc of all the new additions to the game, I hope that 2.1 has more comic strips and maybe cutscene, but in general less black screens  
\-Performance issues, nothing that cant be fixed but...come on hoyo lol  
\-No story replay function from what Ive seen

STORY SCORE: 6/10  
ENDGAME SCORE: 8/10

We recently started a small local film group – Filmfreunde Osnabrück – for anyone who enjoys watching movies in their original language (OV/OmU) and wants to chat about them afterwards over coffee, cake, or a beer.

The idea is simple: go to the cinema together (like Arthouse or Hasetor), watch a film in OV, then hang out and talk about it. Just movies, conversation, and good company.

We’re just getting started and planning the first meetup soon.
If you’re curious or want to stay in the loop, feel free to follow us on Instagram:

Nag work diay ni siya sa laing lugar here in the Philippines (let's call it Pashnea City para ma conceal ang place and di ma trace nako) 

So everytime mo ari siyag Cebu mag catch up jud me and everything. Ako mag plan and all unsay buhaton pero of course kkb. That's all good kay kasabot ko dugay na siya wala naka anhi Cebu. Pero born and raised gud here sa Cebu ni siya. 1 year and a few months na siya sa Pashnea City and muuli siya every other weekend. 

Until slowly naka notice ko na kada kita namo kay mag phone siya, mag cater og calls etc. dili ni siya ing-ani before and mao jud ni ang reason why nagka close mi kay pareha mi og love language which is quality time. And sa iya sad ko nakat-on ani na behavior to keep my phone inside when spending quality time. 

Pag around this month kay niuli na siya sa Cebu for good and nagplan mi magkita. And mao to ni suggest ko magkita mi quick coffee lang to hangout kay I also missed her napod. Pero ni rain check siya kay wala na daw siya budget and all kay naa pa siyay lakaw sa weekend. So ni-ana ko ""okay, cge but ikaw na plan sa next meet up nato ha hahaha. "" (Kay gikapoy nasad jud ko na ako nalang cgeg plan and everything.) 

So ana siya: okay2 

A few days after ni invite ko niya if free ba siya sa weekend and ana siya na ""let me ask permission sa ako parents sa"" 

Like what? That never happened before and let me tell you 28 years old nani siya. 

""Wala ko sugti kay i-save sa daw nako akong laag points"" WTF??? laag points???? Anyway nisabot nalang ko kay basin diay ni strict gyud Iya parents x2 pagbalik niya Cebu

A few days after, one fateful Friday night nikalit siyag chat og quick dinner daw. Ako kay gi prepare jud nako and everything. Like nag make-up pako and all. So siya ako gipapili, so nagkita mi sa SNR and I have a feeling najud ug asa ni padung kay sa iyang text palang daan ka sense nako na nagdali2 siya.

 in my head I was thinking na basin busy gyud diay and because na konsensya siya na cge ra siyag postpone or cancel nako, she tried to fit me in her schedule. These were my thoughts. So ni go rapod ko. 

Pero mao jud ni ang pinaka na offend ko, nagpakuyog siya nako sa grocery kay gipapalit siya og chorizo sa iyang friend sa Pashnea City kay wala daw chorizo adto na pareha kalami sa Cebu city. 

Ako first few thoughts kay mo NO kay lagi nag expect ko the night will end sa SNR na and we will do our own errands. Pero ni go ko because you know, quality time. 

Ang ending is, iya ko gipalinya while nipalit siyag chorizo. 

Haysss pero cge, ako nalang pod ni gipatawad maski na down nagyud ako expectations and everything. 

Niya after namo palit og chorizo nagpa kuyog siya kay nagpapalit iya parents og donuts so sige, nikuyog pod ko. Adto didto naka talk rapod mi a little bit. And then ni-ana siya: ""daghana nato errands today oi."" 

Niya ni-ana ko: ""ikaw ra oi. 

Guys, ganahan jud ko ug grocery dates and everything esp. sa people na ako close jud kaayo. Pero ayaw sad nang wa ta nagkita for a looooongtime niya kapila ka ni cancel, niya katong gipa-plan naka kay igo rata nikaon sa SNR and nagpalit og chorizo sa Pashnea city.
 

Also di tika I-unfriend over this kay grabe so small na reason. Pero mangluod jud ko nimo until you finally plan a hangout na thoughtful.

temperate weather- we like going for hikes, walks with our dog. I’m more heat tolerant due to growing up in Texas, so I will still go outside in 100+ weather… not so sure about months of freeze.

quality of life- I can maintain a middle- upper middle class lifestyle as an RN in Texas. I don’t want to move somewhere like Denver where my salary won’t keep up with COL. 

basic things to do- we like walking around, independent coffee shops, and having a regular bar to grab a drink at.

Sleek, minimal, and effortlessly elegant. It’s the kind of watch I absolutely would love wear to a meeting, a dinner date, or even just on a random coffee run.

1l6dn7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1l6dn7e/i_finally_get_the_importance_of_grinders/,I finally get the importance of Grinders.,"I would like to start by apologising to you absolute gigachads. I was a non-believer of the importance of Grinders. i thought grinders aren't that impressive. I thought everyone here just liked spending money. I have learnt my lesson.

For context, i have never used pre-ground beans. Even when I started with a v60, I bought a cheap Agaro burr grinder. I then ""upgraded"" to an Instacuppa Battery powered electric grinder, a moka pot and a cheap Morphy Richards 4-cup ""espresso""/drip machine which I use when I need more cups of coffee. Still, even with such inexpensive stuff, I got coffee that I enjoyed most of the time, and consistently. 

However, recently I decided to order the Blue Tokai trial pack pre-ground to use for my moka pot. I had already tried the whole beans for the same packs, and I knew i liked it. I'm saving up to buy a Flair Pro 3, and in a way I wanted to prove that buying an expensive grinder makes no sense while mine already does the job. Plus, people keep saying you need very good grinders for espresso, and i thought that was drivel.

I have never had 3 such horrible cups of coffee in my life. The same coffee either tasted extremely bitter, extremely burnt or extremely sour on any random use. It's never the same. On the bright side, I could differentiate all 3 coffees very well as each was so differently horrible from the other. Mind you, I never changed the method for a single one of them. I followed every single James Hoffmann advice for the moka pot. Could not get a single thing working here. Sometimes the extraction time took 5 mins, and I even got it at 1 min once. 

User error? Definitely is possible. But it's the first time ever since I've started being enthusiastic about speciality coffee that I feel so let down. And it's the first time that I've treated my grinder with such respect. I have a newfound love for it, and if such a cheap ceramic burr grinder can give me results that I've enjoyed so much, I can see why everyone here says an even better grinder is life changing. And I genuinely believe those people who proclaimed that buying a grinder was the best decision they made and it's even more important than the coffee machine. Looks like I'm gonna start saving up for a 1zspresso now.

TLDR: Had bad coffee, used pre-ground beans, should've listened to you geniuses. ",5,1749393352.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

🎞️ A good story to hear — before it’s made into a film
🎤 A behind-the-scenes peek at how a script is narrated
🤝 A chance to chat, connect, and maybe collaborate in the future

This is not a paid assignment, just an informal, relaxed session to share a story and get your honest thoughts.
If you're passionate about films, this could be a fun hour well spent.

📩 DM me if you’re interested. I’ll coordinate based on time and location that works for both of us.

I’m looking for alternative ways to break the lease without having to pay penalties or it going on my record etc. But until then I did something bad- something I have never ever done before and idk how to feel about it. 

I’m diagnosed ADHD and PTSD and he knows this, and because he knows this, I feel like he’s gotten better with his insults and manipulation to get me to snap. I have been sooooo good at it lately because I got a new routine where I’ll wake up at 8am (I previously used to wake up as late as noon thanks to him), I make my breakfast hit the gym, come home shower, make my coffee and get to work (WFH) all before he’s even awake. This way, by the time he does wake up I’m already working in my office and can’t be bothered. He leaves for work at 13:30 and gets home around 00:00-00:30 so I’ll already be asleep by the time he gets home, effectively never needing to see or speak to him. He’s also blocked on my phone. 

Well, I made the grave mistake last Friday (not this past one but the one before it) of going out with my girlfriend and having a few drinks. Every single time I go out it’s a problem for him and he gets mad despite me being home with the dogs all day, even when I used to cook and clean, and buy everything for the house, and take care of the dogs all after working 8+ hours he was still mad whenever I did anything for myself of course. 

Well anyway, I got home and he immediately starts picking fights with me because he notices I’ve had drinks and am therefore more easy to trigger. Having adhd already makes it difficult to keep my mouth shut, along with the PTSD, but alcohol just causes one to lose all their common sense and I bit the bait. We got into an argument and a shouting match and he pressed record while I was peeing where I said “your father’s birthday has nothing to do with me, it does not affect MY life” (he got mad I went out with my girl on his father’s birthday.. his father passed away a month ago from old age/stroke/diabetes so it wasn’t sudden). 

I didn’t feel good about the fight obviously, I was angry with myself for engaging and I was disappointed at some of the things I said. But he was ecstatic because now he had “proof” that I’m the crazy unhinged one etc. Of course he only pressed record when he drove me to the edge, and it’s difficult to get proof of their manipulation, triangulation, their mind games and psychological wars.. it’s difficult. But it’s so easy to get on video me yelling and being angry in response. 

Well, I figured out his passcode and deleted the videos.. I also deleted them from the “recently deleted” so it’s gone forever but I feel like it’s only a matter of time before he finds out and causes another fight.. what should I do then? How should I handle it? I don’t regret it since it was absolutely taken out of context and I was half naked and in a compromising situation, and idk what he’d do with those videos, but I feel bad I invaded his privacy and now I’m scared of his reaction once he finds out..

My life was structured, logical, full of joy and sorrows, but it was real, without all this confusion I feel now, or this feeling of lack. I was happy with my life. 

And then, Her. 
I don’t know her. I have never met her. I don’t know if she exists or if she is a figment of my imagination, or even a general archetype. But I know I’m not a dreamer. Never really been. 

She haunts me. She feels so precise, more than just a “type”. 

She is my opposite and my complement. 
We are both women, that’s probably the only thing we share on the surface. 

She’s not easy to explain. Not because she’s complicated (though she is, to most people) but because there’s something about her that slips through language. You can’t reduce her to a “type”, even though people might try. Or my brain just can’t put into words what I’m sensing. Maybe all of it. 

She is American, I am French. I have never even been to the US, I have only spent a week in London, and yet I learnt English at 12 like my life depended on it.

When I say she is American, I mean it not in a cliché way. It’s in her rhythm, in the way she talks with her hands, her language, her culture. 

She’s beautiful, in the “f***, you’re real” kind of way. You see her at her worst and you still want to be there.

Not always happy, not always coherent but…present. She feels things before she thinks them. She acts, then asks questions later. She writes because there’s too much inside her not to. She doesn’t post her drafts. She writes them on notes, in phone memos, in coffee-stained journals she forgets at strangers’ houses.

She’s the kind of woman who feels alive. Really alive.

She has a softness that isn’t loud. It’s the gentle kind but not the one that tries to soothe or fix, it’s the kind that just is. In her voice, low and calm, like a balm to your soul, when she speaks. Like she knows what she wants to say but her mouth sometimes can’t structure it in words. In the way she smiles, like she doesn’t even know she’s doing it.

There’s something in her presence that slows you down. It’s quiet. Intimate. Almost unbearable. That’s the thing, she doesn’t try to be soft. But she is. And maybe that’s why it hits so hard.

I know I’m describing her like one would describe a zodiac sign, vague enough to fit everyone.
But this isn’t a horoscope. This is a... pulse? Like, you don’t know who you are describing until she is right in front of you and it hits you : yes, that’s her. 

It is so strange. I know no one in my life like that, and yet, she is on my mind. She came out of nowhere, and I have no idea what to do with it. 

Dating feels weird now, I can’t help but compare. But compare to whom? I don’t know. 

I’m not religious and I don’t believe in soulmates or anything that’s trendy. 

Maybe, she is just a blueprint of my ideal partner. Maybe a fictional character my subconscious integrated. Who knows. A part of me kind of hope it’s that, just so that I can stop chasing after ghosts. 

But, the weird thing is that she is already making me do things I’ve never done before. I’ve never journaled before, and yet, here I am, writing an entry on the internet. 

Why? I don’t know. A part of me hopes she exists and will read it. The other hopes it will be a catharsis and just get it out of my system for good so I can go on with my life. Words are usually good for that. So here I am. 

It feels almost too… big, to post it, to me. I’m not the type to post on social media, ever. Even less talking about something so intimate. No one in my real life knows about it, and here I am, writing it on the internet. But I kind of feel like it’s the right thing to do. Logic has left my life it seems like when it comes to this, so better go all in, I guess.

I’m sitting there – coffee half empty, messages already buzzing and then it drops.

**The Message.**

*""Hey, can you launch a new campaign today? We need leads. Fast, ideally.""*

No briefing.  
No goals.  
No concept.  
Nothing.

Just that one sentence, burning in neon lights straight from marketing hell:  
**“Just run some ads.”**

And suddenly, it’s clear:  
They’re not looking for a performance marketer.  
They’re looking for a magician.  
A therapist with Meta access.  
A miracle worker for their KPI coma.

I open the ad account:  
✅ Brand new, zero data  
❌ No tracking  
❌ No pixel  
❌ No plan

The creative? A PowerPoint slide smashed into a JPEG.  
The funnel? A one-pager with the sex appeal of a government form.

And then, the cherry on top:  
*""We’ve already spent 1,000 euros. What are we getting back?!""*

The real answer:  
**Disappointment.**

  
Because they believe performance is something you can just ""order.""  
Like a cleaning service. Or pizza.

Then comes the final blow:  
*""We love speed.""*

Yes, you *love* speed.  
But performance loves:

* Data
* Signals
* Creative iteration
* Funnel logic
* Audience understanding

In short: **Systems.**

But what you *really* want is a one-click miracle.  
The myth of “3 leads on day one.”

You want to scale – without foundation.  
You want to sell – without a story.  
You want trust – without proof.

And then you're surprised your “performance marketer” isn’t delivering...  
Even though they’re holding your entire digital disaster together with spit and Canva.

You know what doesn’t work?  
**Wishful thinking under budget pressure.**

Performance isn’t gambling.  
It’s analysis. Structure. Psychology. Testing. Focus.  
It’s craft – not hocus pocus.

So stop calling us your last resort when you never invested in a system to begin with.  
And most of all: Stop acting surprised when chaos doesn’t scale.

**Bottom line:**  
If you truly want to grow – build a foundation.  
If you just want someone to blame when it flops – save us both the time.

1l6djyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1l6djyz/are_there_everyday_obligations/,Are there everyday “obligations”?,"I’m European and discussed this with my American husband recently. I was surprised that he thought “obligations” was a “dirty, negative word” with no everyday relevance beyond distant relationships. 

In my culture, there are many positive and also everyday “obligations”, like…

- You keep your garden well and mow the lawn so your neighbours don’t have to look at the long grass or be embarrassed to live next to you (the garden being well-kept is a bonus for you); 

- You attend family events in good spirits, regardless of your view of said family members and the quality of their company;

- You help each other out constructively, like putting dishes in the right place and maybe helping rinse out your coffee mug, and split chores not because it’s easier but because you sort of owe it to your partner; —and so on.  

My husband’s reaction to the word “obligation” made me curious if this is a male perspective (we’ve all heard of the “mental load” that women suffer), or if it’s an American perspective (that there are no positive or everyday obligations and they’re all bad); or if this is just a “him” perspective. 

What do you think? Are there everyday obligations? If not, how and why do you do things that don’t really affect you but that impact other people? ",22,1749393117.0,AskWomenOver30,27,0.92,False

Those days are officially behind us. In 2025, the no-code revolution has completely transformed how we build digital experiences, making professional website creation accessible to absolutely everyone—from your tech-savvy teenager to your grandmother who still prints out emails.

The numbers tell an incredible story. **By 2025, a staggering 70% of new applications will be built using no-code or low-code technologies**, up from less than 25% in 2020. The no-code website builder market alone is projected to explode from $1.97 billion in 2023 to $3.58 billion by 2031. This isn't just a trend—it's a fundamental shift in how we approach web development.

Whether you're a small business owner needing an online presence yesterday, an entrepreneur testing your latest idea, or a creative professional showcasing your portfolio, this comprehensive guide will walk you through the best no-code website builders available in 2025. We'll explore their strengths, weaknesses, and help you choose the perfect platform for your unique needs.

# What Are No-Code Website Builders?

Think of no-code website builders as the digital equivalent of those modular furniture stores where you can see exactly how everything fits together before you buy it. Instead of writing lines of code that might as well be hieroglyphics to most people, these platforms provide **intuitive visual interfaces** where you can literally drag and drop elements to create your website.

The magic happens behind the scenes. While you're busy arranging text boxes, images, and buttons on your screen like you're decorating a room, the platform automatically generates all the complex code needed to make your website function properly. It's handling everything from responsive design that looks great on phones and tablets to search engine optimization that helps people find your site.

The real game-changer here is **democratization**. Previously, building a professional website required either years of technical training or a significant budget. Now, someone can go from idea to live website in a matter of hours, not months. You're focusing on what matters most—your content, your message, and your business—while the platform handles the technical heavy lifting.

These builders typically offer pre-designed templates that serve as starting points, but don't mistake them for cookie-cutter solutions. The best platforms provide extensive customization options, allowing you to create something that truly reflects your brand and vision. It's like having a professional designer's toolkit without needing the professional designer's degree.

# Top No-Code Website Builders in 2025

Let's dive into the platforms that are leading the charge in the no-code revolution. Each has its own personality and strengths, so think of this as finding your perfect digital partner.

# Webflow: The Designer's Dream Come True

If website builders were cars, **Webflow would be the Tesla**—sophisticated, powerful, and ahead of its time. This platform has earned a cult following among designers and developers who want the flexibility of custom coding without actually having to code.

What sets Webflow apart is its **visual-first approach to web development**. When you design in Webflow, you're not just moving elements around—you're actually building the underlying structure of your website. The platform generates clean, semantic code that developers would be proud to write themselves. This means your website loads faster, ranks better in search engines, and provides a smooth user experience.

Webflow's **built-in CMS capabilities** are particularly impressive. You can create dynamic content structures, manage blog posts, product catalogs, or any type of content collection with ease. The platform also includes robust e-commerce functionality, allowing you to build everything from simple product showcases to full-featured online stores.

The learning curve is steeper than some competitors, but Webflow University provides comprehensive tutorials that make the journey manageable. Reddit users consistently praise Webflow for its clean code output and professional results, with one user noting, ""Webflow has the power of custom coded web development but the accessibility of a visual interface.""

**Pricing starts at around $12-16 per month** for basic sites, with more advanced plans available for growing businesses.

# Wix: The People's Champion

**Wix is like the friendly neighborhood coffee shop** of website builders—welcoming, reliable, and designed with regular folks in mind. With over 200 million users worldwide, it's proven that you don't need to be a tech wizard to create something beautiful and functional.

The platform's **drag-and-drop editor** is genuinely intuitive. You can literally click on any element and move it wherever you want on the page. Want that button to be purple instead of blue? Click and change it. Need to add a photo gallery? Drag it from the sidebar and drop it into place. It's that simple.

Wix's **AI-powered features** have become particularly impressive in 2025. The Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) can create a complete website based on a few questions about your business and preferences. While the results might not win design awards, they provide an excellent starting point that you can customize to your heart's content.

The platform excels in **versatility**. Whether you're building a restaurant website with online ordering, a photography portfolio with stunning galleries, or an e-commerce store with integrated payment processing, Wix has the tools and templates to get you there. Their App Market offers thousands of third-party integrations, essentially turning your website into a powerful business hub.

**Plans start as low as $17 per month**, and there's even a free tier if you're comfortable with Wix branding on your site.

# Squarespace: Where Aesthetics Meet Functionality

**Squarespace is the art gallery of website builders**—everything looks sophisticated, polished, and effortlessly elegant. If your brand values visual impact and you want a website that makes people stop scrolling and say ""wow,"" Squarespace is your go-to platform.

The platform's **template library is genuinely stunning**. Each design feels like it was crafted by a team of professional designers who understand both current trends and timeless appeal. More importantly, these aren't just pretty pictures—they're functional websites with thoughtful user experience design baked in.

Squarespace particularly shines for **creative professionals and lifestyle businesses**. Photographers love the way it showcases images, restaurants appreciate the seamless integration with reservation systems, and bloggers enjoy the platform's superior content management features. The built-in SEO tools are robust, and the platform handles technical aspects like site speed optimization automatically.

One area where Squarespace truly excels is **e-commerce**. The platform provides everything you need to run a professional online store, from inventory management to abandoned cart recovery. The checkout process is smooth and mobile-optimized, which is crucial when you consider that over 50% of online purchases now happen on mobile devices.

**Pricing begins at $16 per month**, positioning it as a premium option that delivers premium results.

# Bubble: The Web App Powerhouse

While most no-code builders focus on traditional websites, **Bubble is designed for creating functional web applications**. Think of it as the platform for building the next Airbnb, not just a website about vacation rentals.

Bubble's **visual programming interface** allows you to create complex workflows, user authentication systems, and database interactions without writing code. You can build marketplace platforms, social networks, SaaS applications, or any web-based tool you can imagine. The platform handles everything from user registration and login systems to payment processing and data management.

The **learning curve is significant**, but the potential is enormous. Many successful startups have used Bubble to build their initial product, validate their market, and even scale to hundreds of thousands of users. The platform's ability to handle complex business logic makes it perfect for MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) and rapid prototyping.

Reddit discussions about Bubble often highlight its **cost-effectiveness for startups**. Instead of hiring a development team that might cost $100,000+ to build a custom application, entrepreneurs can use Bubble to create sophisticated web apps for a fraction of the cost.

**Plans start at $29 per month** for launching your application, with various resource limits and features included.

# WordPress + Elementor: The Ultimate Flexibility Combination

**WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet**, and when combined with Elementor's visual page builder, it becomes an incredibly powerful no-code solution. This combination offers the best of both worlds: WordPress's flexibility and extensive ecosystem with Elementor's user-friendly design interface.

The **WordPress + Elementor combo** is particularly popular among users who want complete control over their website. You're not limited by a platform's restrictions—if you need a specific feature, there's likely a plugin for it. The WordPress repository contains over 60,000 plugins, covering everything from advanced SEO tools to complex e-commerce functionality.

Elementor's **live editing capabilities** let you see changes in real-time as you make them. The platform includes a rich set of widgets and design elements, and its template library continues to grow. Professional web designers often use Elementor because it doesn't generate messy code like some other page builders.

The main advantage is **ownership and portability**. Your website isn't tied to a specific platform—you can move it to any hosting provider, customize it extensively, or hand it off to a developer for further enhancement. This flexibility makes it ideal for businesses that expect to grow and evolve over time.

**Costs vary depending on hosting and plugins**, but you can get started for as little as $5-10 per month for hosting plus $59 annually for Elementor Pro.

# Key Features to Look For

When evaluating no-code website builders, certain features separate the good from the great. Understanding these capabilities will help you make an informed decision that supports both your current needs and future growth.

**Template quality and variety** matter more than you might think. A good template isn't just pretty—it's built with proper information architecture, optimized for conversions, and designed responsively. Look for platforms that offer templates specifically designed for your industry or use case, but also ensure you can customize them extensively.

**Mobile responsiveness** isn't optional anymore—it's essential. With mobile traffic accounting for over 50% of web browsing, your website must look and function perfectly on smartphones and tablets. The best platforms automatically optimize your design for different screen sizes, but also give you control over the mobile experience.

**E-commerce integration** has become increasingly important, even for businesses that don't consider themselves ""online stores."" Whether you're selling physical products, digital downloads, services, or accepting donations, having robust e-commerce capabilities built into your website builder saves time and money.

**SEO tools and performance optimization** directly impact your website's visibility and success. Look for builders that offer customizable meta tags, clean URL structures, fast loading speeds, and integration with analytics tools. Some platforms even provide built-in SEO guidance to help optimize your content.

Finally, consider the **hosting and security** provided by the platform. Reliable uptime, fast global content delivery, SSL certificates, and regular security updates should all be included. These technical aspects are often overlooked but can make or break your website's performance.

# Market Trends and Statistics That Matter

The no-code movement isn't just growing—it's exploding with unprecedented momentum. **The global no-code development platform market is projected to reach $187 billion by 2030**, rising from just $10 billion in 2019. This represents a staggering compound annual growth rate that reflects fundamental changes in how we approach software development.

Perhaps most telling is that **84% of enterprises are now adopting low-code or no-code tools** to bridge the gap created by developer shortages. Companies aren't just using these platforms for quick prototypes—they're building mission-critical applications and websites that serve millions of users.

**Artificial Intelligence integration** has emerged as a major differentiator in 2025. Leading platforms now offer AI-powered design suggestions, automated content optimization, and intelligent layout recommendations. Some builders can even generate entire websites based on a few simple prompts, though human creativity and strategic thinking remain essential for truly effective results.

The **democratization impact** extends beyond just businesses. Educational institutions are using no-code tools for 15% of their administrative processes, while individuals are building personal brands and side businesses at unprecedented rates. **By 2025, citizen developers will outnumber professional developers by 4 to 1**, fundamentally changing the technology landscape.

# How to Choose the Right Builder for Your Needs

Selecting the perfect no-code website builder requires honest assessment of your current situation and future aspirations. Start by defining your **primary purpose**—are you creating a simple informational website, an e-commerce store, a portfolio, or a complex web application? This determines which platforms you should seriously consider.

**Budget considerations** extend beyond monthly subscription fees. Factor in costs for premium templates, third-party integrations, additional storage, and potential migration expenses if you outgrow the platform. Sometimes paying slightly more upfront for a more capable platform saves money and headaches later.

Consider your **technical comfort level** realistically. If you enjoy learning new tools and don't mind watching tutorial videos, platforms like Webflow or Bubble offer incredible power. If you prefer intuitive interfaces that work immediately, Wix or Squarespace might be better fits.

Think about **scalability and future needs**. Will you need team collaboration features? Advanced e-commerce capabilities? Custom integrations? Choose a platform that can grow with your ambitions rather than forcing you to rebuild everything later.

Finally, take advantage of **free trials and testing periods**. Most platforms offer ways to explore their capabilities without committing. Build a simple version of your intended website on multiple platforms to get a feel for their interfaces and capabilities before making your final decision.

# The Future is No-Code

The no-code revolution has fundamentally changed what's possible for individuals and businesses wanting to establish their digital presence. We're living in an era where your ability to create, launch, and iterate on digital products is limited only by your imagination, not your coding skills.

The platforms we've explored represent the current leaders in this space, each offering unique strengths for different use cases. Whether you choose Webflow's design flexibility, Wix's user-friendly approach, Squarespace's aesthetic excellence, Bubble's application-building power, or WordPress + Elementor's ultimate customization, you're joining a movement that's democratizing web development.

The statistics speak for themselves—**70% of new applications will be built with no-code technologies by 2025**. The market is projected to reach **$187 billion by 2030**. These aren't just trends; they represent a fundamental shift in how we build digital experiences.

Your perfect website is waiting to be built, and you already have everything you need to get started. The question isn't whether you can build a professional website without coding—it's which no-code platform will help you bring your vision to life fastest and most effectively.

1l6diuk,https://i.redd.it/mwv9vns4pp5f1.png,"""impatient"" roast curve?","I'm new to roasting and trying to figure out a general way of thinking about roasting. For this bean, I feel like I should be starting at a higher temp and let the bean soak so that my turning point is at around 1:15. 

The thought I'm going after is like a rocket launch. you need enough drive and momentum to get you to orbit (don't stall) but not so much you blow past your orbit (scorching). In this analogy, the heat is applied at 100% during drying and slowly declines as fan speed increases approaching 1rst crack.  
  
My goal for today's roast is to shift the TP to the right and basically flatten the RoR peak a little. Start off at a higher charge temp 395F maybe (hopefully no tipping) and have the beans absorb the heat from the drum before ""firing the main engines""!!! 

The coffee doesn't taste bad, the bean is telling me it's got more to give. Any advice?

1l6dh0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1l6dh0g/tealike_flavour/,Tea-like Flavour,"HI friends!

  
I've had cups from Pallet in Vancouver, and Monogram in Calgary that were so incredibly tea-like in flavour. It's like you can very clearly taste tea leaves in the cup, it's almost hard to believe it's coffee. That first cup at Pallet was what set me on my pour over trajectory. I've been chasing these cups for a while, but can't get very close, even when I buy the same beans. I'm hoping someone can offer some guidance!

  
I have a V60, and a B75. The grinder I use is a ZP6, usually between 4-5. I've been using TWW light profile with distilled water, full packet/gallon.  


Here's my standard V60 recipe:

\-15g beans, 250g water @ 195F

\-Bloom pour of 50g, 45 seconds  
  
\-100g pour  
  
\-100g pour  
  
\-Final drawdown of \~2:30, I don't pay much mind to the time for each pour. I generally pour when I see the water drawing down below the top of the bed. My pours are circular, starting from the centre, moving outward, and moving back to the centre.

  
I find that my cup is usually quite sweet, somewhat juicy, some florals, a little bit more acidic than I'd prefer, but never even close to that tea-like flavour and clarity I had in those cups I'm chasing.



I've been keeping agitation to a minimum lately, but have played around with stirring, swirling, shaking, etc.. I've used higher temps, but I find the lower temp allows the florals to shine through. I've tried higher and lower ratios, and different pour structures, but neither has achieved what I'm aiming for. I haven't ground much coarser than 5, because of the acidity in my cup, but that might be a direction I should test. I also haven't tried TWW at half dilution. Obviously there are lots of variables to test, so I'm hoping someone here may have a pointer or two so I can really make the most of my beans.  


Speaking of beans, here's what I'm drinking today:

Jindo Lavender Lounge

Colombia

Thermal Shock, Washed

Caturra

Descaling indicator light has not flashed for a while. Unit is used moderately, \~5 to 10 espresso/coffees a week.

One morning, woke up and ECO light was flashing, and unit wouldn't turn on. Called Support and tried  a couple resets; 1. Steam + Double coffee buttons & 2. ON + Single espresso. Neither reset worked. Turning steam to complete ON position does nothing. Checked infuser and it seems fine.

After the call, I played around and noticed a couple things: 1. During reset #1 (Steam + Double coffee), water pumps into the water reservoir below the drip tray, and doesn't stop until the water tank is empty. When water tank is empty and removed, the pump continues to try to pump water. Filling water and inserting tank into machine causes it to pump water into the reservoir again. 2. Turning steam to 50% of the way leads to water streaming out the wand. Unfortunately I didn't notice either of these occurring during my call with Support; Air Pod Pros really do block out external noise! :(

She said yes, so I went outside with her. (Please don’t give me any props for helping this lady because it’s just basic human decency.) As we were saying our goodbyes, she said, “Can I give you a hug?” Well, I’ve been a little hug starved lately and so I said, “Of course!” That woman gave me the best hug that I’ve had in a long time.

We talk well with each other. We talk so much non sense too. We are too liberal that we speak topics that usually a male friend with female friend would avoid. This guy said I look good. I too genuinely complimented him saying that he looks good.
But this guy always teases me saying that i have to get married. I thought he was just fun to talk. But of late he kept bringing up about other women in conversation. He keeps saying I tease that other woman A also the same way. Or he keeps saying that there is a woman who made me feel things coz I liked her eyes a lot. He didn't talk to her anyway as she is leaving the place when asked him why don't he go and talk to her, he said it's okay as she is going and once he said that that he has no courage and the other time he said he is feeling bad that she is leaving. What is his behaviour?
When people see us talking they think we are pretty close. But i feel he is so superficial. I once shared something emotional with him and i really thought he would be as vulnerable before me and just coz I asked why doesn't he open up, he keeps saying other women treat him like that too always caring about him.

Even worse he kept saying I have small eyes though I don't have just to tell that the girl he liked has big eyes. I said some guy complimented me and he said that the other guy is just performing and nothing else. I mean if he likes a woman it is about refined taste. but if somebody likes me, it's just performance.

When we sit together or when together, only when I keep engaged in some work or I'm busily looking somewhere else he keeps looking at my face and if I ask what he says it's nothing. I don't know if he does this with his other female friends too. But I it really feels weird. He keeps talking about other women all the time and keep saying they look like that and this .

We both commute at times. Of course i go early at times for his sake and if I ask him to stay back, he stays back. But i feel like this guy talks to me only coz he needs somebody to commute home. But yes there are days i don't take him to his home, he asks somebody and goes. He says that he has so many friends and someone would help him go home. But when I ask him to stay back, he does. We keep having coffee on the way home. The thing I don't understand is, he never feels anything sitting too close even when shoulders touch or legs touch. How can a man feel like that? Is it because he doesn't even care a little about me?

We landed at Orly around 4pm, picked up Navigo Découverte weekly passes (a bit of admin but worth it for getting around, especially if you're there Monday to Sunday), and headed into the city. Our apartment in the Marais was in a great spot, quiet but central. After settling in, we walked to a bistro near the Pompidou, Paris Beaubourg, for dinner.
Afterwards, we strolled to Notre Dame, then down to Square du Vert-Galant, the exact spot my wife and I got engaged 20 years ago. A bit surreal bringing the kids there. We finished the evening with a Seine boat tour at sunset. The light over the city was stunning and it was the perfect way to ease into the trip.

Tuesday
Started the day with a stroll for croissants and coffee in the Marais. The girls were instantly hooked on the pastries.
We packed up and caught the RER from Les Halles to Disneyland, about 45 minutes. Checked into the Disney hotel around 1.30pm and were lucky the room was ready. Quick bag drop and straight to Disney Studios Park.
The Avengers coaster was a big hit, intense but fun. We also did Ratatouille and Tower of Terror, which they loved. The park had a great energy and wasn’t too crowded.

Wednesday
Full day in the main Disneyland park. We arrived for opening to make the most of it. Indiana Jones was the family favourite, a proper rollercoaster thrill.
Unfortunately, Big Thunder Mountain and Hyperspace Mountain were both closed which was a bit of a letdown.
We didn’t go for any dining packages or buffets, just grabbed food at the stands and brought plenty of snacks. It kept things flexible and saved a bit of money.

Thursday
Back to the parks first thing for a final go on some favourites, including Tower of Terror, Indiana Jones and Ratatouille again.
Checked out of the hotel around noon and caught the train back to Paris. Our second apartment was also in the Marais, small but comfortable.
We took it easy that afternoon, then headed to the 17th to visit friends for the evening. Great to relax over some wine and chats while the girls crashed on the couch.

Friday
Early start at the Louvre with 9am tickets, so we got straight in. A real highlight. The girls were more into it than expected, especially the Greek and Egyptian sections. And yes, we saw the Mona Lisa.
Lunch at Kodawari Ramen afterwards. The place looks like a Tokyo market and the food was fantastic. The kids didn’t eat much though, so we followed it up with a couple of Happy Meals at McDonald’s.
In the afternoon we climbed the Arc de Triomphe for amazing views, then took the metro to Trocadéro for a stroll around the Eiffel Tower. We didn’t go up, just walked around and soaked it in. We ended up down at École Militaire before heading back to the Marais. Dinner was at 1745 République, a great modern French spot with a relaxed atmosphere.

Saturday
Final morning. One last walk for croissants and coffee, taking it slow and soaking up the neighbourhood. Then metro back to Orly for the flight home.
Tired but happy, and already talking about when we’ll come back.

How to Legally Stay Long-Term in China (Student Visa vs. Starting a Business),"Struggling to land an English teaching job due to passport/degree issues? Don’t give up on your China dream yet! As an international recruitment consultant, here’s your roadmap to staying legally long-term without a standard work visa.

# ⚠️ First: Avoid Risky ""Solutions""

* **NO overstaying visas** – Fines, detention, or 10-year bans apply.
* **NO illegal work** – Crackdowns intensified post-COVID.
* **NO ""visa runs""** – Border hops no longer reset tourist stays reliably.

Instead, pursue these **two 100% legal paths**:

# 🎓 Path 1: Student Visa (X1/X2)

**Ideal for:** Language learners, degree seekers, or those buying time for job hunting.

If you need helpnavigating the applicaiton process, we can refer you to trusted education concultant specializing in China admissions.

# How It Works

1. **Enroll in a recognized program**:
   * **Chinese language courses** (e.g., HSK prep): Cheapest option. Many universities offer 1-2 year programs (e.g., BLCU in Beijing).
   * **Degree programs**: Bachelor’s/Master’s in English-taught fields (Business, IR).
2. **Apply for admission**:
   * Minimum HSK 4 for degree programs (varies by uni). Language courses: zero prerequisites.
   * Required docs: Passport, academic transcripts, bank statement (proving \~$5,000 USD savings).
3. **Visa perks**:
   * **Part-time work allowed**: Up to 15 hrs/week *after* 1st semester (with school permission).
   * **Long stays**: X1 visa covers 1+ years; renewable.
   * **Path to work**: Internships → job offers → convert to work visa.

# 💰 Costs & Tips

* **Tuition**: 15,000–35,000 RMB/year (language courses); 20,000–80,000 RMB/year (degrees).
* **Scholarships**: Apply for CSC (Chinese Govt Scholarship) or Confucius Institute grants.
* **Pro tip**: Tier 2/3 cities (e.g., Chengdu, Qingdao) have lower living costs + generous uni subsidies. 

# 🚀 Path 2: Start Your Own Business (Entrepreneur Work Visa)

**Ideal for:** Freelancers, consultants, or those businessmen.

# For personalized guidance on WFOE registration in China, comment below or contact our experts directly: Email: [vivian.qi@atglobalconsulting.com](https://mailto:vivian.qi@atglobalconsulting.com/)

💼 Business Ideas with Low Entry Barriers

* **Consulting**: Education, marketing, ESG.
* **E-commerce**: Export Chinese goods (toothbrush factories need you!).
* **F&B**: Coffee shops/bars in expat-heavy areas.

# ⚖️ Reality Check

* **Taxes**: ≈25% corporate tax + VAT (varies by sector).
* **Hire locals**: Mandatory for visa renewal (2+ employees).
* **Profitability**: Most WFOEs break even in 12–18 months.

# 📌 Key Considerations

|**Factor**|**Student Visa**|**Entrepreneur Visa**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Upfront Cost**|Low (tuition + living)|High (capital + legal fees ≈50k–200k RMB)|
|**Income Potential**|Limited (part-time wages)|High (but risky)|
|**Visa Stability**|High (renewable with grades)|Medium (tied to business performance)|
|**Best For**|Under 30s / career shifters|Mid-career professionals / investors|

# 🛑 Critical Warnings

* **Consult professionals**: Hire a China-registered agent (e.g., Appletree Global Consulting) for WFOE setup. DIY risks rejection.
* **Student visa limits**: Working over 15 hrs/week = deportation.
* **""Green Card"" option**: Apply after 4 consecutive years of work visas + stable income/taxes (extremely rare).

1l6da8w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l6da8w,Off Grid Cabin In The be Woods UK,"Introducing the only off grid woodland cabin currently on the market in the whole of the United Kingdom. Current planning restrictions prohibit building in woodlands in the U.K. This cabin was built in approximately 1910. Please share our listing and spread the word so we can find the right buyer for our pride and joy.

This property consists of two stunning fully off grid cabins situated in an ancient woodland in Northumberland. It is classed as an ancient woodland because it is over 400 years old. In the springtime the woods is blanketed with blue bell flowers, wild garlic and snowdrops.  The woodland is teeming with wildlife such as newts, toads, red kites, badgers, hedgehogs, rabbits, hares and deer. The area has lots of foot paths for endless dog walks. 

The cabin site consists of 10 cabins. This is the first time one is being advertised on the open market, before now they were sold behind closed doors privately. 

The dawn chorus every morning is simply breathtaking. The cabins are turn key ready for you to move in and getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is conveniently located 10 miles drive away from Newcastle upon Tyne, 5 hours from London or 12 mins walk from the train station. 

Although you’re surrounded by nature, the property is also close to various amenities such as a supermarket which is only is a short 5 minutes drive away, a good local pub and a village store is just 10 minutes walk from the cabin. If a pub within walking distance is not your cup of tea you could join the local fishing or canoeing club. 

The larger cabin comprises of a main living area, a kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms and a porch with a log store fully stocked with firewood for next winter. The smaller cabin is a one bedroom guesthouse with a shower and canter lever double bed. The garden space is very generous at 10 x 40 meters, it has lots of established willow trees and is lined with cobble stone paths. We have strawberries, cherry, apple and pear trees plus blackberry and raspberry bushes. To the right of the property there is a 5 meter wide geo dome which is ideal for growing vegetables, herbs and other plants. It can also be upgraded into a green house to grow a wider variety of food. 
Between the larger and the smaller cabin there is a decked area  which we use to exercise and has a fire pit. The is also an outdoor compost toilet as well as a tool shed for extra storage. 

The cabins are fully off grid and were professionally wired and signed off by an electrician with 240 volts plugs in every room, 12 volts lighting and plenty of usb sockets all running off 4 large solar panels powering 2 separate battery banks with a backup 3000 watts electric start Honda generator. The cabins are equipped with a Netgear internet router and an Ariel on the roof providing 24/7 5G broadband. Both cabins are fully plumbed in with hot & cold running water throughout provided by two Calor gas boilers. The cabins have large log burners which thump out the heat on cold winter nights.

The kitchen in the larger cabin is equipped with gas powered hobs, a blue tiled back splash, raw living wood countertop, a stainless steel sink as well as plenty of cupboard & shelving space. 
The living room is spacious and is centred around our stunning red combo log fire and oven. It has a comfy blue vintage ercol sofa, a six seater dining table and a storage cupboard.  
Bedroom 1 has floor to ceiling windows where you can often see deers and squirrels running past. It has a double bed with lots of under bed storage space aswell well as a wardrobe. 
Bedroom 2 has a top bunk double bed made of raw living wood, and an under bed wardrobe. 
The bathroom has a large roll top bath with floor to ceiling windows, it has a sink and a fully functioning compost toilet. 

The smaller cabin is furnished with a stunning canter lever bunk double bed made with living wood beams. It has an overhead rain shower, breakfast bar and kitchen space. There is a log fire and outdoor decking for lounging or your morning coffee. 

After a 100 years of private ownership, the woodland has recently been purchased by the Woodland Trust so now cabin owners have multigenerational security in their lease. The Woodland Trust is the UK’s largest woodland conservation charity, dedicated to protecting, restoring, and creating native woodlands.
The current lease for the past 100 years has been a rolling annual lease.
The lease states that the cabin is suitable for use all year round except for one week so it’s classed as a holiday let and is therefore eligible have no council tax bills. You’ll also be pleased to hear that the running costs and bills are refreshingly low. 

My husband has lived here for 5 years and got the keys just before lockdown. He love the off-grid lifestyle, but I don’t, especially now that we’ve also just had a baby — so we’re letting the cabins go as we prepare for a new chapter together. 

Proof of funds will be required before viewing. £165,000 or highest offer.

Honestly, across all the restaurants and food spots on the island, this is one of the best. Everything is made from scratch — even their hash brown patties, which is super rare in a touristy town. No microwaved eggs (huge pet peeve of mine). Real maple syrup.

Coffee-wise, I think it’s easily one of the best on the island. They use Variety Coffee (great NYC roaster), organic cane sugar syrups instead of the usual artificial ones, and their prices are the same as everywhere else — maybe even a better value since they give you 4 shots in a large latte with no extra charge.

Honestly, for both food and coffee, it’s hard to beat for quality and price.

I don't like being stoned often or acting impaired. I get selfconcious and only at home doing nothing is comfortable. Often I'll smoke more with another person because they are rather than actually caring to for my own reasons.

For medicinal purposes, I use weed for heavy duty panic attacks, anxiety and nausea. It works well for panic attacks and nausea especially. No other medication has helped either as quickly and effectively as weed does. My panic is gone in minutes and nothing is going to do that for intense panic without IV medications. 

When I try to smoke it recreationally, half of the time it will bring on anxiety to some degree or a sudden and big panic attack. Like right now it's a Sunday morning so I had a little by myself with my coffee. Not nearly a whole joint but just some puffs off of one. I'm not freaking out but I have anxiety that wasn't there before smoking. Doesn't matter the mood I'm in beforehand. It can happen any time I smoke. I become nervous, sweaty, nauseous and I'm panicking like it's the first time I've ever smoked. 

Anyone have a good explanation? It's definitely not just the strains I use. It can happen off of the same weed I used yesterday. Maybe I'm smoking more when I do it recreationally? Is it my panic disorder not liking it certain times? Is this not just a me thing?

On one hand, I'm really proud of myself because I managed to get out of my comfort zone. On the other hand, I can't help but think it's sad that I'm happy with myself, as talking to women in a casual way is supposed to be normal, everyday stuff that most men can easily do.

When talking to other men, I can talk without thinking and easily make a conversation last. However, talking to the baristas was hard as fuck, I was constantly thinking about what to say and how to keep the conversation going.

If it wasn't for one of the women mentioning a certain video game, I genuinely have no idea how I'd start the conversation.

Despite everything I've mentioned, I'm still really proud that I managed to keep the conversation going for around 20 minutes (on and off).

1l6d5re,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1l6d5re/the_weight_of_what_stays/,The Weight of What Stays,"Brother Lee stood in the kitchen at four in the morning, holding two pieces of paper that felt heavier than the cast-iron griddle. The deed to Flora’s Diner was typed on county letterhead, official and cold. The other was handwritten in Flora’s cramped script: *For Brother—the only one who never asked me where I’m heading.* 

Two weeks since Flora died, cancer eating through her lungs like acid through metal until she couldn’t draw breath. One day since the lawyer handed him thirty years worth of letters, all addressed to Sarah Brennan in Portland, Oregon. All unsent.

Brother struck a match, lit the pilot. The coffee maker gurgled to life, a sound Flora used to say reminded her of an old man clearing his throat. Now it sounded like drowning.

He pulled the first letter from the manila envelope, yellowed and brittle as corn husks.

*Dear Sarah,* *Your birthday was last week. Twenty-three now, if my math holds. I wonder if you still like chocolate cake or if you’ve moved on to something more. I made one anyway, devil’s food with buttercream, sat it on the counter till the frosting went stale and the flies claimed it.*

*The tire plant laid off another twelve men this month. Families packing up, moving south where the work is. Town’s getting smaller by the season, shrinking like a dried apple.*

*Your mother (I still don’t know what else to call myself),* *Flora*

The bell chimed. Jory pushed through, guitar case in one hand, thermos in the other. Kid looked older than his nineteen years, but then everyone in Millhaven aged fast.

“Coffee ready?” Jory asked.

Brother poured two cups, black. “Been thinking about your music idea.”

For weeks Jory had been suggesting they clear out the back room, set up a small stage.

“Flora left some things. Letters. Might be that I understand now why she kept this place going.” Brother sipped his coffee, winced. “Music might help.”

Brother pulled out another letter, this one stained with coffee rings and what might have been tears.

*Dear Sarah,* *There’s a man who comes in here, calls himself Brother. Real name’s Lee, but he wears his mistakes on his knuckles like a badge. Came here running from something, stayed because he found something worth staying for. He’s got the kind of heart that holds people together when everything else falls apart. The kind that knows how to carry weight without breaking.*

*I think about that sometimes. About the difference between running from something and running to something. About whether love can grow in the cracks of broken things.*

*Wondering about you,* *Flora*

Brother’s hands shook. 

Donny Finch, the writer, showed up around two, notebook under his arm. “Quiet day.”

“Flora always said quiet days were for thinking.” Donny accepted coffee. “What you thinking about?”

Brother found himself telling Donny about the letters, about the weight of inheriting something he’d never expected.

“Flora was a keeper of stories,” Donny said. “Every person who came through that door, she remembered something about them. This place isn’t just a diner. It’s a memory bank.”

That evening, Brother sat with the last letter, paper so fragile it threatened to crumble in his hands. Flora’s handwriting was shaky here, morphine and pain making the words struggle across the page like wounded animals.

*Dear Sarah,* *I’m giving these letters to someone who understands the difference between holding on and letting go. The cancer’s in my bones now, eating me from the inside like rust in old metal. But I’m not afraid. I made my peace with dying the day I gave you life.*

*I don’t know if you’ll want to hear from an old woman who gave you away before she learned how to love properly. But giving you up was the hardest thing I ever did, and keeping this place going was the only way I knew how to honor that sacrifice.*

*Every person I fed, every story I heard, every small kindness I witnessed, it was all for you. All love given in your name to the family I chose instead of the one I couldn’t keep.*

*Your mother, finally,* *Flora*

Brother walked to the register, looked behind it for the first time since Flora died. There, tucked between expired health certificates and old receipts, was a small photograph: a young woman with Flora’s eyes and a smile that could light up a room.

He pulled out paper and pen, began to write:

*Dear Sarah,* 

*My name is Lee, though most folks call me Brother. I run a diner in Millhaven, Ohio that your birth mother left to me when she died. She also left me thirty years of letters she wrote to you but never sent.*

*Your mother loved you every day of her life, even from a distance. These letters tell the story of a woman who made a home from broken things. They’re yours now, if you want them.*

*If you ever find yourself driving through Ohio, there’s always a cup of coffee waiting.*

*Brother Lee*

He sealed the letter with the thirty others, walked through the empty diner to the front door. The neon sign flickered, still missing that N.

Outside, snow fell like ash from some distant fire, dusting Millhaven in temporary beauty. Brother walked to the post office, dropped the letters in the slot, listened to them fall into darkness like stones into a well, then went back to the diner.

Tomorrow would bring customers who couldn’t afford to tip, equipment that needed fixing with baling wire and prayer. It would bring all the weight of keeping something precious alive. But tonight, it was enough to know that somewhere in Portland, a woman named Sarah might soon learn that she’d been loved across thirty years and two thousand miles by a mother who’d given her everything by giving her away.

Brother fired up the grill, started prep for the morning rush.

Last year I met a girl while we were both visiting our parents abroad. Our families were next-door neighbors, so we spent a lot of time together. We were never alone at first, but I started to like her. One night I asked her to go out, she agrees and we had a great time and got closer. We tried planning more outings, but bad weather got in the way.

One day we went biking, then sat on a bench by a pool. She kept glancing at my lips, so I put my arm around her expecting a move, but she didn't even flinch. I guess we were not on the same page at all. So i assumed she wasn't into me and would distance herself, politely, since were still living so close, and our parents are very good friends, but instead, over the next week she opened up more, started calling me by name for the first time and even flirted about my hair in front of our parents.

We went out again and had another fun time. She asked if I had a girlfriend ""back home"" and kept pushing me (3-4 times) to try her drink from her straw if I was not ""disgusted"". I finally sipped from the glass, but out of fear or rejection or to not be ""pushy"" I avoided the straw on purpose. Later on the bus, I gently put my hand on her back to guide her and she suddenly sped up like she wanted to get away. I figured that was the end.

A few days later she kept loudly talking to her mom about wanting to bike clearly hinting for me to ask her (and yes, it really was like that, I'm not over analyzing, you had to be there to know). I did, and before we left, she went home to ""grab something"" and came back with chewing gum. That felt like another hint, but I wasn't sure, so I stupidly invite our mom with us, and of course nothing happens.

Our last ""notable"" moment was at a water park, a week before she flew back home. Her whole family and only me. We were scared to go on the slide, so I jokingly said we should go down together. After a few minutes standing there hesitating, she asked ""So are we going together or what?"" I thought this was finally it, i sit on the slide, scoot over to make place for her and said lets go. But she sort of panicked and said ""no no, ill go alone"", and without hesitation she jumps in the slide and goes down. So I said ill finally leave it.

2 weeks after she got home, and on the day before mine and my mom's flight, her mother was on a video call with her explaining to her how I made sure her bank transfer from her parents went through, and told her she should take me out and pay for my coffee, to which she says ""when he comes back"" When I got home, I waited until she was back from a trip to text her. Unlike before, she was slow and dry in replies. She was also avoiding me on 2 occasions, she was supposed to drop off a book and something else, we lived 10 minutes away on foot, but she made sure she didn't come by and dropped my of at my mom's workplace.

Now, a year later, I found out she recently got a boyfriend and it got me thinking for some reason if I was just too afraid of rejection and was acting ""too cool about it"" and missed my chance, or maybe she never was interested in the first place. That 2 day late reply and rejection felt like she absolutely didn't want anything from me, even though it didn't feel like it when we were together really.",1,1749392036.0,Advice,2,1.0,False
