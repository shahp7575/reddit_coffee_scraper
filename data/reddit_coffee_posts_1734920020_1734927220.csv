1hkfp5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1hkfp5q/i_want_to_confess_to_my_crush_by_the_new_years/,I want to confess to my crush by the new years but I am scared of ruining our friendship. ,"I am 20 year old male, and I have been friends with this girl I like for 3 years. She’s also 20 years and bisexual. I was crushing massively on her when we first started talking and we talked pretty consistently throughout my second semester of college. Before Valentine’s Day, she attempted to flirt with me using these cat memes, but I wasn’t sure if she was being serious or just sending them for fun. I asked if she was serious, but she was like “no I do this to my other friends”, but a part of me believes her response was because I sounded like I was uninterested when I asked “were you serious?”. We hung out with during Valentine’s Day. We went to the movies, got coffee, and browsed around stores. On paper, it seems like a date, but it wasn’t. During the this time, I was very much blinded by love. I had a certain idea of her in my head, and as I got to know her throughout the semester, I started to recognize her flaws and issues. But we all got flaws and issues, but my point is she wasn’t as perfect as I was making her out to be originally. During this time, I was acting very superficial, like your stereotypical “nice guy”, and I think it showed. I dropped the facade quick. 

During the summer she ended up getting a girlfriend. They were together for about a year. During that year she became a bit more distant from me, but I was still good friends with her. But my interactions with her were a bit more limited. I don’t really know anything about their relationship other than her girlfriend is a massive activist. They eventually split up for reasons I don’t know about. From what I know she seems to be not very phased by it. The moment she told me she got a girlfriend, I pretty slowly lost interest in her romantically. I remained friends, but I never really thought about her romantically. And so I thought I basically moved on from my crush. 

Fast forward to my 5th semester, which is close present. Me and my friends planned a formal event for ourselves, where we dress up nice and walk around a town center and eat at a fancy restaurant as a celebration for the end of the semester. I asked the girl if she was down to come join and she said yes. She looked very beautiful that evening, and she even complimented me as well. Throughout the whole evening, she stuck very close by my side, and wanted to get many pictures with me. I even drove her home and stayed at her house till 12 watching tv and chatting with her parents. Ever since then, she has been texting me very consistently about every little thing that goes on in her day and even FaceTiming. I feel like I’m even closer to her now than I was when I initially started talking to her. I also am way more open and have less of filter than when I initially was talking to her. She is currently on a family vacation for winter break, but we have so much hangouts planned when she comes back. 


As of right now, she is my best friend and I am her best friend as well. All my other friends whom I consider my closest friends are in relationships, so subsequently, they’ve been a bit distant. I really appreciate the friendship and bond we have with each other right now. We are well aware about one another’s flaws, insecurities, interests, and aspirations. I really enjoy talking to her, but I also really love her. I really want to confess to her, but I don’t want to ruin my friendship with her. I want what we have to last a bit longer, but at the same time I don’t want to make the same mistake I made two years ago of not being honest about my feelings. She’s all I’ve been thinking about, and I’m glad the semester is over or else I wouldn’t be getting much done. I fear if I don’t tell her, I’ll remain friends, but she might end with someone else without her never knowing about my feelings like it did 2 years ago. But if I do tell her, it’ll be awkward between us and the friendship may sizzle out. I have other friends I can fall back on, but I also don’t want to lose her. I’m very conflicted.",2,1734926887.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1hkfofo,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1hkfofo/all_because_i_liked_a_boy/,All because I liked a boy.,"Hey everyone, this is my first time posting, and I really need some perspective on this situation. Deep down, I know what I probably need to do, but I need to hear it from others.

So, I (17F) started talking to this guy (19M) about three weeks ago. We met because he randomly added me on Snapchat. One night, I jokingly told him he should come say hi (it was 2 AM), and to my surprise, he actually showed up. We had a really fun time together, and after that, we decided to keep seeing each other.

Early on, he told me that he had just ended things with his ex but that he really liked me and could see us having a relationship in the future. I thought that sounded promising, so I kept seeing him. We quickly started spending time together almost every day. After about a week, we kissed, and a week later, we slept together.

Yesterday, we had plans to go to the Christmas market together, but he texted me saying he’d be late because he was helping a friend fix his car. I decided to grab some coffee while I waited. But while I was walking around, I saw him with his friend buying supplies for the car. At that moment, I felt reassured because I’d been a little paranoid he might be seeing someone else, and this confirmed he wasn’t lying—at least, so I thought.

Fast forward: I waited for him in the cold for three hours. I called and texted him multiple times, but he didn’t respond and had even turned off his location. Eventually, I gave up and texted him that I was heading home. He later replied, apologizing, which was nice, but I was still upset.

After dinner, I decided to meet some friends at a café, but they ended up being at a friend’s house instead. On my way there, guess who I saw? The guy I’ve been seeing—walking with his arm around another girl. I was shocked. This was the same guy who told me he was “fixing a car.” I didn’t see them kiss or anything, but I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.

I panicked and called him again. No answer. So I left him a *very calm and understanding voicemail* (just kidding, it was not calm). I went to my friends’ house, crying, and told them everything. In the heat of the moment, I drank half a bottle of wine in about five minutes and called him again. This time, he picked up. I said, “Should I tell her, or are you going to?” He started apologizing, but I demanded he come over and explain everything to me in person.

When he showed up, he admitted that the girl I saw him with was his ex. He said they had broken up two weeks ago and that being with me was his way of trying to move on from her. He apologized and said it’s been hard for him to let go. Despite everything, I told him I still wanted to see him (yes, I know how dumb this sounds now) but warned him that if he lied to me again, I’d be done.

Later that night, I found his ex’s Instagram and decided to DM her. She told me that they had actually broken up just *two days ago* because she caught him texting me and other girls. I told her that he and I had slept together the day before. She was furious and immediately called him.

He then called me, begging me not to tell her we’d slept together. I panicked and lied to her, saying I made it up just to get a reaction out of her. I apologized to her, but I feel horrible about it.

Somehow, after all this, I ended up at his house again. We talked and decided we were going to keep seeing each other, but I told him that I’m done if I catch him lying again.

I know how ridiculous this sounds. I know I deserve better. Tomorrow, I plan to set firm boundaries with him, but honestly, I need to hear from you all—please don’t hold back. I need to know why I shouldn’t keep seeing him and why I need to move on for good. Be brutally honest.",1,1734926816.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're dreaming of a radiant smile that turns heads and brightens your day, consider the advantages of using a teeth whitening pen crafted by dental professionals. These pens provide a convenient way to achieve whiter teeth without the need for complicated procedures. Here’s how a made-by-dentists teeth whitening pen can transform your smile.

### Effective and Quick Results

One of the standout features of a dentist-created teeth whitening pen is its effectiveness. The formula is designed to target stains caused by coffee, tea, wine, and everyday foods. Most users report noticeable results within a few applications, which is a huge benefit if you're preparing for an event like a wedding or reunion.

### Easy to Use Anytime, Anywhere

Whitening pens are incredibly user-friendly. Here’s how simple it is:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Twist the base:** This action dispenses the whitening gel onto the brush tip.
- **Apply:** Paint the gel directly onto your teeth, focusing on stained areas.
- **Let it dry:** Just wait a few minutes! There’s no need to rinse.

This portability means you can whiten your teeth during your lunch break, while commuting, or even right before a big date. It’s a discreet and straightforward solution that fits into any lifestyle.

How to Choose the Right Teeth Whitening Pen for Your Dental Needs
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening pens are convenient tools for achieving a brighter smile. However, with so many options available, it can be tricky to find the right one for your dental needs. In order to make an informed choice, consider several key factors that can impact your whitening experience.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understand Your Tooth Sensitivity

Before selecting a teeth whitening pen, assess your tooth sensitivity. Some individuals experience discomfort with whitening products due to strong ingredients. If you have sensitive teeth, look for pens specifically designed for sensitive teeth. These products usually have lower concentrations of active whitening agents, making them gentler on your enamel.

### Ingredients Matter

Examine the ingredients in the teeth whitening pen. Most pens utilize hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide as the active whitening agents. Here's what to consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This is commonly found in professional whitening treatments and is very effective. However, it can be harsh on sensitive teeth.
- **Carbamide Peroxide:** A more stable option that breaks down into hydrogen peroxide. It is often gentle and takes longer to take effect, which can be ideal for individuals who prefer a milder approach.
- **Natural Ingredients:** Some whitening pens utilize natural ingredients, such as baking soda or activated charcoal. These may be preferable for those looking for chemical-free options.

### Whitening Strength

The strength of the whitening agent is another essential factor. Depending on your current tooth shade, you may need a stronger pen for noticeable results. If your teeth are mildly stained, a lower concentration may be sufficient. However, if they are deeply discolored, you'll want to opt for a pen with a higher concentration.

### Ease of Use

The design and application of the pen can greatly influence your experience. Choose a pen that you find easy to use and comfortable to handle. Most whitening pens feature a twist mechanism or a brush tip for application. Make sure that the pen allows for precise application, especially if you’re targeting specific areas of your teeth.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Check for ADA Approval

When selecting a whitening pen, look for any endorsements or approvals from the American Dental Association (ADA). While it’s not mandatory, ADA approval indicates that the product has undergone rigorous testing for safety and effectiveness. Products that hold such marks often provide more reassurance about their claims.

### Read Customer Reviews

Customer reviews are invaluable when evaluating whitening pens. By reading experiences shared by other users, you can gain insights into effectiveness, ease of use, and any potential side effects. Look for pens with a high number of positive reviews, paying attention to comments about results and sensitivities.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Consider Your Lifestyle

Your lifestyle plays a crucial role in which teeth whitening pen you should choose. If you’re constantly on the go, look for a portable option that you can use anywhere. Some pens come in compact sizes that fit easily in a purse or pocket, allowing for quick touch-ups. Conversely, if you tend to forget to apply products daily, consider a pen with longer-lasting effects for less frequent application.

### Price vs. Quality

While cost shouldn't be the only factor, it's important to balance price with quality. Cheaper products may seem attractive but could lack effectiveness or contain harmful additives. On the other hand, pricier options aren't always better. Research various products and find one that fits within your budget while maintaining high quality and safety standards.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Follow Instructions for Best Results

Regardless of the teeth whitening pen you choose, following the manufacturer's instructions is key to achieving the best results. Overusing products can harm your enamel and cause sensitivity. Stick to the suggested application times and frequency specified on the product packaging.

By considering these crucial factors—sensitivity, ingredients, strength, ease of use, customer feedback, and lifestyle—you can confidently select a teeth whitening pen that meets your dental needs. Remember, the ultimate goal is a brighter, healthier smile you can be proud of!

### Conclusion

When considering a brighter smile, using a made by dentists teeth whitening pen can be an excellent choice. These pens are designed with professional insights and formulated for effective results, ensuring that you are investing in a product that prioritizes your dental health. The convenience of a teeth whitening pen allows you to easily incorporate it into your daily routine, enhancing your oral care while providing noticeable results over time.

Selecting the right teeth whitening pen tailored to your specific dental needs is crucial. Always look for pens with active ingredients that suit your sensitivity levels, and pay attention to the application process for the best experience. Some pens are designed for quick touch-ups, while others may offer longer-term treatments. Understanding your goals—be it a special event or simply maintaining a bright smile—will help you make an informed choice.

Ultimately, achieving that dazzling smile you’ve always wanted is within your reach with the right knowledge and product. A made by dentists teeth whitening pen can dramatically improve the brightness of your teeth, boost your confidence, and transform the way you feel about your smile. So, explore your options, consult with your dentist if needed, and take that confident step towards a brighter future—after all, your smile deserves to shine.

1hkffv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GridDownGuide/comments/1hkffv1/what_are_the_most_effective_natural_water_filters/,What Are The Most Effective Natural Water Filters?,"The Most Effective Natural Water Filters: Options and Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------------

Water is essential for life, and ensuring that you have access to clean and safe drinking water is crucial. Many people are turning to natural water filters as a sustainable and effective way to improve water quality. With a variety of options available, understanding the most effective natural water filters helps you make informed decisions for your health and environment.

### Understanding Natural Water Filters

Natural water filters work by utilizing the natural filtering properties of certain materials and plants. These filters can remove contaminants, impurities, and harmful microorganisms from water. Whether it's for home use or outdoor adventures, these filters are valuable tools for ensuring clean water. The key benefits include their affordability, sustainability, and ease of use.

### Popular Options for Natural Water Filters

1. **Sand and Gravel Filters**
This common method uses multiple layers of sand and gravel to filter water. The larger gravel particles trap larger debris, while finer sand particles remove smaller particles and contaminants. Building a simple sand and gravel filter can be done with ease using buckets or barrels.

3. **Activated Charcoal**
Activated charcoal is known for its ability to adsorb impurities and toxins from water. You can create a filter by placing activated charcoal in a container with holes at the bottom. It's effective at reducing chlorine, sediments, and organic compounds.

5. **Plant-Based Filters**
Certain plants, like specific types of ferns and grasses, can purify water. These plants absorb and filter out pollutants. A simple way to use this method is by creating a biofilter, where plant roots are combined with sand and gravel.

7. **Clay Pot Filters**
Clay pot filters have been used for centuries in many cultures. The porous nature of clay allows water to pass through while trapping bacteria and other impurities. This natural filtration method is effective for household use and is easy to maintain.

9. **Bio-Sand Filters**
Bio-sand filters are an advanced version of sand filters. They contain a top layer of active biomaterials, which helps in the decomposition of bacteria and viruses. Constructing a bio-sand filter at home can provide ongoing access to clean drinking water.


### Benefits of Using Natural Water Filters

There are numerous advantages to using natural water filters instead of traditional air purification systems. Here are some key benefits:

- **Cost-Effective:** Many natural water filters can be built using inexpensive materials found around the home or in nature, making them accessible for everyone.
- **Environmentally Friendly:** Natural filters often have a lower environmental impact compared to manufactured filters, which may require electricity or produce waste.
- **Health Benefits:** Using a natural filter can reduce your exposure to harmful chemicals and contaminants, promoting better health.
- **Improves Taste:** Natural water filters can enhance the taste of water by removing chlorine and other unwanted flavors, offering a fresher drinking experience.
- **Easy Maintenance:** Most natural filters are simple to maintain and can last for a long time with minimal effort.

### How to Choose the Right Natural Water Filter

Selecting the right natural water filter depends on various factors, including your specific needs, location, and the quality of your water source. Here are some tips to help you choose:

- **Assess Water Quality:** Test your water to understand what contaminants are present. This will guide you in selecting a filter that effectively reduces them.
- **Consider Usage:** Determine how much filtered water you will need on a daily basis. Larger setups might be necessary for households, while smaller filters could work for camping trips.
- **Research Options:** Look into the different types of natural filters, read reviews, and consider the maintenance requirements for each option.
- **Location Matters:** If you’re filtering water from a natural source, such as a river, ensure your filter is robust enough to handle the specific contaminants present.

Natural water filters into your daily routine can lead to healthier drinking water and a cleaner planet. By exploring the options and understanding the benefits, you can find the best solution tailored to your needs while maintaining a sustainable lifestyle.

How to Set Up a DIY Natural Water Filtration System at Home
-----------------------------------------------------------

Setting up a DIY natural water filtration system in your home can be an enjoyable and rewarding project. You can ensure that your drinking water is clean and fresh. With a few materials and a little effort, you can create a simple yet effective system. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

### Materials You Will Need

- Plastic container or bucket (with a lid)
- Activated charcoal
- Sand (fine and coarse)
- Gravel (small stones)
- Cheesecloth or a coffee filter
- Drilling tool or knife (for making holes)
- Clean water (to test your system)

### Building Your Filter

Follow these steps to build your natural water filter:

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Container

Start with the plastic container or bucket. This will house your filtering materials. If your container does not have drainage holes at the bottom, use a drill or knife to create several small holes. This allows the filtered water to exit. Ensure that the holes are big enough to let water flow freely, yet small enough to keep the filtering materials from falling through.

#### Step 2: Layer Your Materials

After preparing your container, it's time to layer the filtration materials. The order of layers is crucial for effective filtration.

1. **Cheesecloth/Coffee Filter:** Place a piece of cheesecloth or a coffee filter over the holes at the bottom of the container. This prevents the other materials from falling through while letting water pass.
2. **Gravel:** Add a layer of small gravel. This layer helps to filter out larger particles from the water.
3. **Coarse Sand:** Add a layer of coarse sand on top of the gravel. This layer captures finer particles.
4. **Fine Sand:** Next, layer fine sand to catch even smaller particles.
5. **Activated Charcoal:** layer activated charcoal at the top. This is the key ingredient as it helps remove contaminants, odors, and bad tastes from the water.

#### Step 3: Adding Water

Once your layers are set, it’s time to test your system. Slowly pour clean water into the top of your filter. Allow it to seep through each layer and collect in the container below. Be patient, as the water will take some time to filter through all the materials.

### Cleaning and Maintenance

To keep your DIY water filtration system effective, regular cleaning is necessary. Depending on your usage, consider the following:

- Replace the activated charcoal every 2-3 months, as it becomes less effective over time.
- Change the sand and gravel layers as they can accumulate impurities.
- Clean the container regularly to prevent bacteria or mold buildup.

### Testing Your Filtration System

After setting up your filter, it's recommended to test the filtered water. You can use a water testing kit available at most home improvement stores. Look for common contaminants such as:

- Bacteria
- Chlorine
- Heavy metals

Ensuring your water is safe to drink is critical. If your initial filtration results are not satisfactory, consider adding more layers or different materials.

### Additional Tips

Be mindful that while a DIY filtration system can greatly improve water quality, it may not remove all harmful substances. Always research local water sources, especially if you plan to use the filter for well water or untreated water.

If you want to enhance filtration further, you could explore adding other natural materials, such as crushed shells or specific stones known for their filtration properties. Experimenting can help you find the most suitable combination for your needs.

Creating your own natural water filtration system at home not only encourages self-sufficiency but also teaches valuable lessons in sustainability. Enjoy the process of building and maintaining your filter, and take pride in the fresh water you will enjoy!

### Conclusion

Choosing the most effective natural water filters for your home is not just about convenience, but it's also about ensuring clean, safe drinking water for you and your loved ones. From sand and gravel filters to activated charcoal systems, each option offers unique benefits that align with different needs and preferences. By considering factors such as water source, filtration rate, and maintenance requirements, you can select the best natural filtration method for your household.

Setting up a DIY natural water filtration system at home is an empowering choice that allows you to take control over your drinking water quality. It’s both a rewarding and educational experience that can deepen your understanding of water purity. Utilizing simple materials, like sand, gravel, and charcoal, you can create a filtration system that effectively removes contaminants while remaining eco-friendly. This hands-on approach not only simplifies the water purification process but also fosters a sustainable mindset toward resources.

Remember, implementing these natural water filters can significantly improve the quality of the water you consume, making it clearer and safer. As you explore these natural filtration options, take the time to experiment with DIY setups that cater to your needs. Not only will you ensure a continuous supply of clean water, but you'll also contribute to a healthier environment. Embracing these principles of natural filtration empowers you to enhance your quality of life, one sip at a time.

If you romance Lucanis, on your first coffee date with him, you can answer his question to ""what a first kiss feels like"" or what not, with stating you don't know, as you don't have much experience in first kisses. Which felt to me like a subtle way of saying Rook is on the younger side and hasn't had time for romance.

And then from my understanding, the Emmrich romance goes out of it's way to tell you it's an age gap romance. That he is much older.

You breathe in the cool air.

Start heading towards the pine trees in the back,
Looking like Christmas trees all covered in white.

Your favorite person to be with.

The person you want to enjoy this season with 

Experience all that it will bring with them by you,
By your side, creating lasting memories.

They come over and take your hand 

Their smile fills you with joy and excitement,
You just know inside today is going to be special.

You two take in the beauty of this day

This past May, however, it was happening so frequent I had to bite the bullet and make an appointment with my PCP. Ran a lot of different tests (No diabetes, no kidney/thyroid issues, no utis, etc). 

I'm currently seeing a urologist, as well as a gastroenterologist to help with constipation (urologist suspects the constipation and frequency are directly correlated).

Im on meds to deal with the constipation + metamucil but it really isnt making a super noticeable difference. And when I do have a movement, I feel it irritates my bladder 100x worse.

I have my next appointment with urologist in January. I got to my breaking point today when I was doing my voiding diary (tracking how much I'm drinking + peeing). I drank about 60 fl oz today (14 of those being a coffee) and have already peed about 62 oz. It's not even time for bed yet. I just feel so hopeless.

If you are sensitive about gender identity this isn't for you, Shes a staunch feminist and her thwacked out rants WILL cause distress. ( i haven't seen or spoken to her for years) \*\*\*\* This takes place in the early 2000s

 This leg beard has to be taken in small doses, or we will be lying next to Funky P Beard in a daze of nastiness that even Vinceys wholesome memes can fix. I wouldn't be surprised if she was in an devils 3 way somewhere with Mori and Chris Trucker on a truck lot looking for meth. (you can read about Chris Trucker on reddxreads.  These stories aren't in any particular order as I have 20 years of them stored in this ADHD brain. Gather close \*motions to sit by the campfire\* Everyone here? Good, lets get into the Chronicles of: 

Meth Beth, the Psychic, Vampire, Leg Beard 

  CAST: Beth, typical budget Victorian style goth chick, overweight and built like Crash Bandicoot, she sported snaked bite earrings embedded in crusty, over picked lips. She had large, green, glassy, (heavily lined) eyes that rarely blinked. Black, greasy, frizzy, hair that usually hit her shoulder blades, and oily, sticky skin. Shes able to amass followers easily because beards and incels exist. Self-proclaimed psychic, healer, and apt to banishing evil......

Sunny: Beths childhood friend. to describe her, she is a labrador reincarnated as a human. She basically gets along with everyone, loyal to a fault, naive, kind of slow on the uptake, nice girl in the making. Shes a very pretty girl, tall, medium length blond hair and blue eyes, very Scandinavian looking and LOVED the perfume Hollister August.  her antics were freaking hilarious. Sunny also was a cosplayer, into anime, president of the RPG club in high school. Beard bait is an understatement.

 I'm OP: I was friends with this beard,  i have no excuse. I didn't keep good company, like many undiagnosed neurodivergents we miss red flags, even if its a bright red LED one. I'm female, snarky, average build, emo at that time and very much into MCR. I love people watching. I looked like your typical assembly line ""rawr means I love you in dinosaur"" Emo girl

 Tweedle Dee and Dum: The stink weasels I lived with at the time. They looked so alike that they figured they're reincarnated twins or something with lore.  They look the ACTUALLY meme guy. They were complete cretins, they lived off of student loans, gamed in their rooms and took online courses. This was college apartment housing and rent was cheap because of the odiferous Tweedels. I wasn't home enough to care too much. They always smell like greasy hair, juicy farts, and stale ketchup                                                                                                                                                           

Book One: The Vampiress

 It was one of those rare days off I got so I happened to be at the coffee table working on a project. \*\*\*\*\*I shall let you in on a secret of KILLING beard odors is a mixture of cheap vodka and water. You mix, spray in the bottle and there you go. Use it on carpets, upholstery, THEM: it dries quickly and kills bacteria and mold otherwise id be living in Febreze scented dumpster\*\*\*\*\*\*\* I usually stay in my room because i don't eat or cook in common areas. I have a mini fridge in my room, and I usually eat at work so that E. coli station can stay as is.

As I was working on this animation project second guessing my life's choices that led me to think this was a good career path when entered the Tweedels to the kitchen excitedly warbling at each other as their fat, pube encrusted, waddles beneath their jaws were jiggling with each facial movement. Their twitchy beady eyes were unblinkingly looking intently on a laptop screen while Dees oily, bratwurst fingers typed quickly on the crunchy keyboard, with each distinct, sticky, crunchy sound I died inside. I then was horrified to see that these idiots were getting aroused, and they didn't seem to notice I was there!!!

Enraged, because their excitement was starting to make itself uhhhh ""visible"". I bellowed in a voice that would make even Odin take heed. ""Guys, can you take your hentai to one of your rooms, I don't need to see your Vienna sausage sized boners."" Both beards snap their heads towards me with Dee with a mighty REEEEEEE he screeched at me ""THIS ISNT PRON!!!! Our QUEEN is coming tonight for ritual! I just blinked slowly. ""Queen?"" I asked dumbstruck. This time it was Dum who took over as Dee was close to having a coronary on my quip towards them. Dum showed me the laptop, I dared not touch it, for all the jizz that compact machine endured Id become pregnant by proxy. ""VampireFreaks....."" I said in monotone. ""So y'all are freaks who think they're vampires?"" I continued in the same monotone voice.

This earned another outburst from Dee while Dum went ""dude chill, we need to meditate and be ready for ritual at midnight."" Dee looked he wanted to reenact Homer choking Bart with me playing the role of Bart. The only good side of living here is messing with Dee the Degenerate, Dum is the beta to Dees ""Alpha."" and a bit more levelheaded, though he's still gross. ""We are new members for HER coven"" Dum continued, ""but with the ritual, she will be able to see our powers and make us permanent members."" Dum said with pride. I for once didnt have a clapback to that, i just stood there from the stupidity that my brain processed. ""You guys are aware that this place reeks and is filthy right?""

 Dee was no longer red in the face but purple. I have the master room so its pristine in there as is the bathroom. I picked up my laptop, went into my room, put on my noise canceling headphones and indulged in some edibles. If people who are out of their minds are congregating at my place I might as well join them in being out of my mind. It was nearing 8pm and these eddies has me higher than Snoop Dogg, I was watching Music Videos (I'm emo remember gosh) when the door bursts open; the Mexican cleaning lady looked just as startled and mortified as I was. Here is this blazed, emo, goblin, huddled on her bed surrounded by munchies and Dr. Pepper with wide, unblinking red eyes staring at a laptop. I legit think I hissed at her like Gollum.

This poor abuela slowly backed out and shut the door with a pardon as I message Dum ""WTF!"" The response that I got was basically him saying that they hired a cleaning lady, that he and Dee are getting essentials for tonight's Lunar Ritual. The stink weasels are really serious about this, they NEVER clean! I was musing to myself when I heard a distinct, heavy, gag followed by a door slammed and a ""Dios Mio."" I wondered which beard lair she encountered first; I don't dare to venture to their section of that home, even Balerion the Black Dread would not venture there, but this amazing, tiny, descendent of the Mayans tied a cloth over her nose and mouth and went to war.

I saw her throw out a stiff comforter out of the room. it landed with a thud as clouds of dried cum, skin, and mites mushroomed up. Our eyes locked, I nodded to her as the Queen nodded to Kind Leonidas before he kicked that infidel down the well, she stopped. It was a biohazard, and I will rather burn alive than let someone's granny deal with, with THIS! She was ranting the whole time and her exclamations of disgust, horror, or bewilderment. As if the remarks of vitriol and sheer disgust was a summoning spell for the wonder weasels, the front door opened.

It wasn't the summoning spell for the stupendous stupids, this bag lady in a cape swept in like she owned the place. You know year 1 potions meeting Snape for the first time? Yeah, that's how she entered the apartment, with a self-implied grandiosity. Then the sweaty snatch smell hit, that and bath and body works body spray is her signature scent. You wouldn't want to tousle with her, she's built like Octoberfest bouncers named Olga. She opened her crusty mouth to inquire ""Leviathan? Damien? with a raised, hastily drawn on sharpie eyebrow.

I will leave this here. I will continue when I have a chance, enjoy!",0,1734924566.0,neckbeardstories,0,0.33,False
1hkf1jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/JockoPodcast/comments/1hkf1jr/wake_up/,Wake Up,"Gentlemen,  

Jocko Willink would like you all to believe that you can grindset your way to self actualization, or that you can buy it in one of his books.  

Here’s the truth.  It isn’t something you buy, it isn’t something you earn.  Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn’t.  That pre workout and 5am workout isn’t going to fill that wife and children sized holes in you.  

James Stockdale didn’t have a podcast.  He just had his head kicked in by the NVA for eight years and then lived the rest of his life the best way he knew how.  Manhood to him wasn’t a sweaty fucking kettlebell or chewing glass or whatever else you sad fucks think it is.  I doubt he gave much thought to “being a man.”  He was too busy doing the best he could.  

On the other end of the spectrum my Dad was never a POW and he was never in combat.  He was just a peace time Soldier trying to raise a family doing the best he could.  He’s now sixty four and he takes MS medication and since his brain surgery he’s kind of a laconic asshole and I think sometimes he drinks more crown royal then he should.  He was a dick to me as a kid sometimes.  But you know what?  He was a great father, he taught me that it’s okay to cry.  He gave his family everything he had so we could have decent childhoods and have some kind of jump off point as an adult.  I got equal measures of ass kicking and pats on the back from him.  

Where am I going with this?  

Being a man isn’t spending four hours a day in the gym or reveling in life’s misfortune or having a six pack or any of the other dumb shit that Jocko or Andy Elliot or Goggins is trying to sell you.  It’s the quiet, fucking boring ass work of trying to not be a piece of shit to your siblings or your parents or coworkers.  It’s raising a family.  It’s turning 30 and realizing your twenties were fucking crazy and trying to not be that guy anymore while simultaneously realizing that a small part of you will always be that guy.  

Work out, take care of your body, all that shit.  

If you want to cultivate your mind don’t read any of Jocko’s gay books.  Read Cormac McCarthy or CS Lewis or Toni Morrison or some good non fiction.  Read The Kite Runner.  Read Guns of August.  Stay the fuck away from the shit that’s trying to convince you that discipline = freedom.  Self discipline is great but real life isn’t a fucking Jean Claud Van Damme montage.  

If you want a wife get a Match.com account or if you’re in your thirties go find a single mom or teacher or nurse and for God’s sake don’t be afraid to be vulnerable.  

Real manhood isn’t sleeve tattoos and Garmin watches and black coffee and guns and whisky.  All those things are fine.  Real manhood is mostly dull.  Mostly boring.  There’s very little exciting in this life.  But we do it because it’s our job.  ",4,1734924562.0,JockoPodcast,2,0.64,False

1hkeyyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/arushi/comments/1hkeyyc/the_list/,The List,"[\[WP\] You are just a normal office guy; until you published the government names of all top villains including the address of their hideout and their weaknesses. You gave a deadline to the hero association, or their list comes next.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1hej5zt/wp_you_are_just_a_normal_office_guy_until_you/)

  
The list has shaken up the country. Some of the villains are famous people. I don’t know why people are surprised. It’s usually the wealthy that have the spare time to cause havoc for no reason. Some of them are normal people, with nine to five jobs and two-point-five kids, living in suburbia. For the moment, they have only been ostracized by their neighbors. Those villains whose families did not know of their hidden lives have left them, and they’ve lost their jobs. 

I go to my computer. I’m sitting in a coffee shop, because in case they try to trace me, they’ll only get to this place, which is five miles away from my apartment. I’m wearing a surgical mask, coughing frequently to show that I’m just a good person, trying to not spread my cold to other people. They probably won’t be able to match my face from the occasional seconds I lower the mask to drink my coffee, but I’m not the only one here who’s wearing one. 

The whole shop is filled with people and their laptops, some getting their work done, some not. A few of them look far more like criminals than I do. I’ve realized that now, that criminality does not have any defining physical trait. One of the villains was a swimsuit model, another a beloved childrens’ TV show narrator. Evil comes in all shapes and forms, whatever will get it through the door. 

It has been a few days since the list has been announced. There is no proof, true. The villains were very good at covering their tracks. I suppose they had some headquarters I wasn’t aware of, and decided to all collectively deny their villainy. Some of them own media organizations, and the news has been stifled. 

Now, I’m onto the second step of my plan. I release the letter. It’s a letter I drafted carefully, that took hours to perfect. I wanted no loose threads, no loopholes for them to exploit. 

Every time the villains wreak havoc, people get hurt. Sometimes, people die. They return to their hideouts and plan their next as if they haven’t destroyed a family, sent someone into crippling medical debt. The heroes, too, in their chases cause damage. They destroy entire buildings in their game of cat and mouse, and for some reason, we all cheer for the lesser of two evils. 

I hit send, and the letter uploads onto the website. I’m clear. They have one week to eliminate all the villains on the list. No innocents can die in the process. It doesn’t matter if the villains are outside of the city, or even if they escape to the international space station. By the end of the week, midnight at the IDLW time zone, every one of them must be dead.

Over the next week, I wait and watch. The news channels not financed by the villains start airing the news of deaths. Eventually, other news sources follow. After a certain amount of time, they too realize that it is useless swimming against the tide. The news dominates everything else. People see the heroes and the villains for what they truly are. Monsters. They realize the thing I knew for months. Some things are too dangerous to be allowed to exist freely. Debates begin, from politicians and philosophers, questioning curtailing the power of heroes. The only difference between a hero and a villain is their intention, and intentions can change. 

On the last day, the heroes search frantically for the last person on the list. A small, almost inconsequential villain who had mostly done mischief more than harm. She robbed banks, she stole paintings and precious jewels from art exhibits, and otherwise lived an unobtrusive life. She wasn’t the type to have many resources to hide, and despite her thieving, she wasn’t extremely rich. But they could not find her. 

The clock ticked towards midnight in the IDLW time zone, the last time zone on earth, and the heroes grew desperate. Finally, they found her death certificate. Dead during a fight between a hero and villain a few months before, her apartment torn apart brick by brick by the impact of both of them crashing into it. The news uploaded her obituary. Her face was splashed all over the internet. 

See? The heroes were saying. She’s dead already. The list has been cleared. 

I’m in a train station when my phone rings with the alarm, on my way to work. I ignore the TV screens showing my late girlfriend’s smiling face. Lucia was a villain, a criminal, but she should have been caught, not killed. The news spoke of her death almost compassionately. She was almost a Robin Hood. She had stolen from the rich, and gave some portion of it to the poor. In a sane world, she would be in jail. 

I stopped the alarm on my phone and moved to another app. The new list was filled with names, addresses, and even more details. I hit send. The government would take care of the rest. ",1,1734924295.0,arushi,0,1.0,False

1hkeufl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkeufl,"Another tourist food diary in NYC, how did we do? ","In no particular order, here’s what my partner and I ate this week in NYC. We have been a handful of times before, and we travelled with my family who are pretty picky eaters so most of these were my partner and I only. Tried to prioritize places with seating because… it was FREEZING this week. Partner always craves Asian foods and I always crave Mexican and Mediterranean… so here is our summary of the week! We shared most meals since we wanted to try a lot of places over the course of the trip. 

Spot dessert bar
Harvest- 10/10
Cookie skillet- 10/10 
Golden toast- 6.9/10 
This is a repeat for us as we come every time we are in town. Partner is obsessed with the Harvest dessert. We are both obsessed with the cookie skillet. It is the cutest little place and always has fun music and great energy. The golden toast is meh, not bad but not nearly as good as the other two. We always join the waitlist online before going in person because it’s relatively accurate and we always go at night when it’s busy. 

Omar’s Mediterranean
Chicken Shwarma plate with rice, salad, hummus, with the free pita and Baklava- 10/10
Died and went to heaven. Service was amazing, portions huge. Perfect lunch spot. I could’ve eaten this every day and been happy.

Devoción
Cappuccino- 9/10
Guava Cappuccino- 7.8/10
Banana bread- 8/10
Mocha- 9/10 
Best cappuccino I have had in the city, and my partner loved the mocha. Their pastries in my experience are nothing insanely good but not bad either. We always pick one or two. This trip we had the guava croissant and banana bread, both were decent. They never have any seats available but very cute in the inside. This is a repeat for us, we have gone to Devoción on previous trips and continue to come back as we are coffee addicts and they have never failed us.

Shukette
Frena bread- 8.5/10
Not your average Hummus- 6.5/10
Areyas- 10/10
Really enjoyed the bread and hummus, but just think my expectations were really high.. and I thought the hummus was indeed elevated, but average. The Areyas however…. AMAZING, no notes. The sauce that came with it was somehow even better. Wanted to try so much more but we were full since we ate before this. Want to go again with a bigger appetite! Atmosphere was very chic inside.

Serendipity
Sunday Chicken Dinner Sundae- 5/10
Nachos- 8/10
Was okay, this was my family’s choice so we got roped into this one. Kinda cute on the inside and great service. If you ever have to go here… the nachos are actually pretty darn good. Chicken sundae was not close to worth the calories or money. 

Levains
Cappuccino- 7.2/10
Original chocolate chip walnut cookie- 10/10 
The cookie was soooo good and warm. Not much seating inside and it was packed. Cappuccino was nothing to write home about but not bad at all. 

Joe’s Pizza
Pepperoni pizza- 8.5/10
Supreme- 8/10
A repeat for us as well. Easy consistent slice. Would love to try more but we always end up near at some point on a trip so we end up continuing to go. It’s definitely great but I always wish it had a little more sauce. Always end up finding seating and not waiting long. 

Koba Korean
Build your own bowl with the spicy chicken and Bulgogi- 9.5/10
Definitely affordable for the sheer amount of food they gave us. My partner and I split a bowl and we were both filled to the brim. I’ve had better Korean but rating it so high considering the quality of food (we were dying for veggies and protein) for the price we were stoked. Still reallly great Korean, astonishing at the price point in my opinion. 

Sugarfish
Don’t think, just eat tasting menu- 9.5/10
Tuna w ponzu and scallion- 10/10 
Nigori- 9/10
Partner did the highest tier of tasting menus for around 70 dollars. It was really high quality fish. I am not much of a sushi lover but my partner is. I loved their tuna with ponzu and scallions. We also had their nigori which was great. Experience and service was lovely and so was atmosphere. Edamame was standard, my partner honestly loved everything except for the pink lobster nigiri he was served. Would also order the Nigori alcohol again if we were in the mood, very sweet but lovely. This was affordable high quality sushi in my opinion, as we didn’t want to spend for an expensive omakase but I didn’t want to do a cheap place either.

Carmines
Spaghetti- 7/10
Chicken carbonara- 8/10
Garlic bread- 9/10
 Touristy pick by our relatives who joined us but honestly…. Kinda enjoyed it. We went with a group of 7 and it ended up being so affordable and we ordered the spaghetti, chicken carbonara, and the garlic bread. The garlic bread was a big hit. Spaghetti was basic but decent to me. Chicken carbonara was surprisingly yum. Was just expecting given how touristy it is that it would be bad but was pleasantly surprised. Wouldn’t necessarily take myself there for Italian but not opposed at all to going again. 

Electric burrito
Pollo Asada burrito- 9.7/10. 
Only note is I felt the burrito had a tad bit too much rice. The flavors were amazing, portion was huge, price was very fair. Was not busy both times we went and was rather quick service. Feel like if I lived here I would be ordering this often. We went twice because it was that convenient and yummy. 

Ess a bagel
Morning classic on everything bagel- 9.5/10 
Mr Nova Lova- 7/10
Strawberry cream cheese- 10/10
Cappuccino- 2/10
Ordered the morning classic (just a BEC I believe) and my partner ordered the Mr Nova Lova (a loaded salmon and cream cheese style bagel). The wait was a bit extreme but I personally enjoyed the bagel a lot. It really kept me full nearly all day. The salmon bagel was good but my partner did mention he would’ve taken a few things off as it was a lot going on for his tastes. Also I ordered a side of the strawberry cream cheese and YUM. My sister ordered a vegetable cream cheese bagel and she also enjoyed! However… their cappuccino tasted so watered down. I couldn’t even finish it. My sister loved their hot chocolate though.. but her food tastes are questionable so take that with a grain of salt. 

Best Bagel and Coffee
BEC bagel- 7.5/10
Cappuccino- 5/10 
We got a BEC bagel and a cappuccino. Coffee was average. Would get again if I was in a rush. The bagel was small for the price which was my largest complaint and the flavor didn’t make up for it. 

Honorable mentions/additional details: 
- Canes is so mid up here. It’s so much better in the south I promise.
- Valerie cocktail bar is somewhere we went on a previous trip and loved it! Enjoyed the waygu bao buns and truffle fries. Forgot what else we ate. 
- If you have to eat in Times Square we always go to the O’ Donahues steak sandwich and onion rings and malt vinegar. I don’t love when the steak sandwich is fattier, and it has happened 1 out of the 4 times I’ve been. But I still go if I am hungry in the area! Bonus points for the Christmas decor. 
- Russian Samovar, went on a previous trip and I thought it was a very unique experience. Wonderful atmosphere and great Russian food. 
- Angelina Paris- We stopped by and had hot chocolate. Basic maybe, but I thoroughly enjoy.

This means you can power things like laptops, phones, small appliances like a coffee maker, and even some power tools while you're on the road.

The inverter also comes with a carrying case, which makes it easy to store and transport. I did find that the inverter can get a little warm when it's under heavy load. However, the cooling fan does a good job of keeping it from overheating. Overall, I am happy with the Walfront Car Inverter 1000W. It is a reliable and affordable way to power your devices on the go.

I recently used the Walfront Car Inverter 1000W for a camping trip. I was able to use it to power my laptop, phone, and a small refrigerator. I was also able to use it to charge my drone battery. The inverter worked great and I was able to stay connected and powered up throughout my trip. I would definitely recommend the Walfront Car Inverter 1000W to anyone who needs to power their devices on the go.

1hkerva,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1hkerva/df54_variability/,DF54 variability,"I ordered a DF54 from Turin Grinders on 12/10 to pair with my first ever espresso machine, the De'Longhi Dedica Maestro Plus that I picked up earlier this month. It's on backorder and has not shipped yet, so I've been doing a lot of research online here on Reddit and elsewhere, and while overwhelmingly the consensus is very positive, especially at its price point, one common theme seems to be variability in manufacturing tolerances, specifically related to burr alignment and the zero point. How prevalent is this problem and if the one I get is not aligned, should I send it or attempt to align it myself? I've seen the 3D printed dials you can get to adjust the zero point location on the dial, but I'd rather get the burrs aligned to have the zero point at its proper 6 o'clock location rather than changing the dial pointer which seems like more of  a workaround for an improperly aligned burr set.

I know I'm sounding OCD, but curious to hear feedback from users here.

Regardless, I'm looking forward to receiving it as I'm getting tired of using preground coffee in pressurized baskets and am looking forward to getting into the art of espresso making.",1,1734923572.0,espresso,5,1.0,False
1hkeqaf,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hkeqaf,INCH Bag 2.0,"Thank you to everyone in the community who commented on my previous bug out bag. There was a lot of great advice which I have incorporated into this new setup. I'm posting this new INCH bag for you to critique. Let me know what you would do differently given the scenario below:

This bag was assembled with the intention of being able to sustain myself for weeks or perhaps indefinitely. The bag with food, guns, and ammo is 63lbs. I am 6'5"", 230lbs, in shape. I can carry this bag but not easily and not very far each day. The weight is a big problem so please provide input on what could be cut. 

The scenario that I'm preparing for is if the power grid were to go down for 3 weeks+. I understand many in the community favor the bug-in strategy, but this is not tenable for me as I live in a densely populated apartment complex in a large city. I figure once food and water runs out for the majority of people nearby (2-3 weeks), then things would start getting ugly.

My bug out plan is essentially to throw my bag and as much guns/ammo/food as possible into my F-150 and head to a family member's homestead outside of the city. If the road is blocked then I take the bag and start walking. I would shadow the roads from the nearby woods/ fields and head to the homestead. 

I appreciate the ""Gray man"" perspective, but I'm not too concerned with looking innocuous in an urban setting. My goal would be to avoid people whatsoever. If threatened I would use my handgun to pop off a few rounds and hope my offender reconsiders the risk vs reward of trying to take my shit. Depending on the perceived danger of the journey, I may swap the Henry AR-7 for my AK. 

See photo breakdown below:
1-2: front and back of the backpack. The pack is an Alps Outdoorz. I could remove the pack from the frame and use the frame as a meat carrier. 

3-4: overview of the bag's contents

5: (6) MREs in a 13L dry bag

6: dehydrated food including four servings of Mac n cheese (delicious)

7: mess kit, instant coffee, sugar, fire starting kit including tinder matches and lighters, roll of moleskin for blisters, gas stove

8: electronics. Elecom nestout battery, lamp, and solar panel. Baofeng radio with a telescopic Nagoya antenna. Kindle (with a ton of books about survival, tracking, hunting, fishing, trapping, maps, knot tying, ect. Please provide book recommendations. I also have a few dozen books from a fantasy series I enjoy). Ultra light headlamp. Rechargeable electric lighter. All in a SLNT Faraday drybag.

9. Medical kit including foot powder, trauma bandage and bleed stop. Tools like forceps and tweezers. Medications such as anti diarrhea, aspirin, painkillers, burn cream. Alcohol swaps, gloves, antibiotic ointment. Trauma shears and a tourniquet holder. Apparently my pervious tourniquets were fake so I still need to purchase a proper one. 

10: admin kit. Emergency mylar blanket, head net for bugs, sewing kit, three rolls of tape, deck of waterproof cards, scouring pad, write in the rain notepads, mechanical pencil, small flashlight, lockpicks.

11: water filtration kit. Sawyer squeeze filter, 8L collection bag, two smaller bags, filter accessories, chlorine purification tablets, iodine purification tablets, heavy metal test kits. 

12: toiletries. Microfiber cloth, tp, dude wipes (cringe whatever), toothbrush, toothpaste.

13: clothes. Long sleeve shirt, cold weather pants, two pairs of wool socks, underwear, shemagh, poncho, gloves.

14: water storage. Grayl titanium filter bottle with cook lid, Nesting pot and case for the grayl, 2L plastic insulated canteen, 3L camelback.

15: fishing kit. 4 fishing yoyos for passive fishing, fly kit with extra hooks, fishing line. I need to add weighs and have been considering carrying a compact rod. 

16: sleep system. Crua duo tent, thermarest sleeping pad, and a 100% wool blanket (being used as backdrop). I know everyone says to drop the tent and use a bivy instead. If I'm living out of this bag indefinitely then I do not want to sleep in a bivy. 

17: tools. Machete (a lot of people said to drop this but I really enjoy this machete. Brush is impassable without a machete, and this one is 3/16"" steel so I can use it to baton logs or use it as a draw knife.), sven saw, knife, ferro rod, compass, diamond knife sharpener pen, titanium trowel, titanium spork, multitool, 550 paracord.

18. Pew pew. Polish P-64. Basically a makarov. Will probably swap this for a .22 handgun so that my handgun and rifle will share ammo. 

19. Pew pew. Henry AR-7 survival rifle chambered in .22 lr. The action/ barrel take down and fit into the stock. See the overview photo at the beginning to see it taken down. I may switch this out for my AK chambered in 7.62x39mm if I determine the situation to be particularly hot. 

20. Ammo. 1000 rounds of .22 and fifty rounds of 9x18mm. Cleaning kit oil, rod, swabs, and brushes.

This might be a long read, so I apologize in advance. I’ve been reaching out to various support groups, but I feel like I’m getting nowhere and may even be singled out in some cases. Hoping the Reddit community can provide some insight or support.

I’ve been dealing with GI issues since early October and have seen six different doctors so far. I’ve been told it could be GERD, gastritis, or ulcers. While I understand the basics of each, I’d love to hear from people who’ve actually been diagnosed with these conditions.

Here’s what’s been going on:

My symptoms started with a persistent pressure in my upper left side, right below my rib cage, just under my breast area. Sometimes it caused pain, but the pressure was the most bothersome. It disappeared for a bit, but it came back in early October, followed by a host of new symptoms: indigestion, reflux, loss of appetite, vomiting bile, upper stomach pain, and nausea.

After about two weeks, things improved somewhat. Now my main symptoms are a persistent lack of appetite, occasional nausea, burping, and off-and-on stomach pains. I’ve undergone a CT scan, X-rays, a full blood panel, and tests for food allergies, H. pylori, liver and kidney function, thyroid, and hormone levels. Everything came back normal except for a mildly fatty liver (ALT 80).

Some other odd symptoms:
	•	My bowel habits have changed—softer, mushy stools once a day, sometimes with a yellowish hue (though this seems to be improving).
	•	My periods have been shorter, around 2-3 days instead of my usual 5.

As for my GI issues, I think I’m slowly getting better. The nausea happens less often, and I’ve gone days without stomach pain. But my loss of appetite hasn’t improved much. I haven’t been following a strict diet and eat things that GERD sufferers are told to avoid (fast food, soda, coffee, chocolate, alcohol). Most of the time, these don’t seem to make my symptoms worse, though I occasionally get indigestion or stomach pain after eating. It’s hit or miss.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Could this still be GERD or gastritis even if I’m able to eat these foods without consistent issues?

Everyone keeps saying it’s just stress, but I’ve been stressed my whole life and never dealt with symptoms like this.

Any help, advice, or similar stories would mean so much.  Thank you. ",2,1734923223.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

However, sometimes if I really like a girl, for example if we matched and have been texting for more than a few days and have great banter, I might ask them out to dinner for a first date because I already have a feeling that they'll be worth it. Or if it's someone I met in person either at an event or through a friend group, dinner seems like a safer bet since we've already determined that we have chemistry IRL, so going to a nice restaurant would be more sincere than just asking for a coffee or a drink at that point.

So basically the more I like a girl, the more likely I am to take them out for dinner on a first date. Drinks are for girls who I'm not so sure about, but I still want to give a chance to. I know a lot of redditors say the first date should never be dinner because it's too much of an investment. But personally the first dates where I've taken the girl to dinner have always ended up being more enjoyable than simply meeting for drinks late at night and then having to leave after a couple of hours, because I already know that I like them enough to want to have a full meal with them.",8,1734922363.0,dating,27,1.0,False

I also finally started the keychain I'm making for my Aunt as a Christmas gift, she has cockatoos. It is speedrun time baybee.

So, I have taken some suggestions from comments on my original post and picked up some items to make up a VIA Rail style guest amenities bag for passengers that ride along in my transport truck.

I got a 3 piece towel set, body wash, shampoo, mouth wash, deodorant stick, and ear plugs.  

Unfortunately I wasn’t able to find any  eye masks or pillow chocolates, as I was in a bit of a rush.  I’ll see about getting them at another time.

If anyone else has any other suggestions, I’d love to hear them.

And since some commenters seemed interested in my truck’s sleeper berth set up, I figured I’d include some pictures.

On the upper berth: Switches for door locks, and overhead compartment lights, a reading light, 2x 12v DC power ports, a USB charging port with cable for a cell phone, a cup holder with bottled water included, a tray for wallet, phone, glasses, etc… extra storage, and amenities bag.

On the lower berth: Switches for door locks, and overhead compartment lights, a reading light, 2x 12v DC power ports, a USB charging port with cable for a cell phone, 2 cup holders, a tray for wallet, phone, glasses, etc…, alarm clock, controls for HVAC, power inverter, and diesel heater, amenities bag Keurig coffee maker, and 24” 1080p hd smart tv.",20,1734921700.0,ViaRail,5,0.95,False

1hke73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hke73n/aita_for_defendidng_my_fiance_from_his_mother/,AITA for defendidng my fiance from his mother?,"Hi, my name is Kate and I'm 30 years old. My fiance (30) has a mother who is becoming more and more unbearable. I want to ask the reddit users if I'm so terrible for defending myself and my partner. The situation is like this. (T apologize for any mistakes, English is not my native language.)  
Before Christmas (about a month before), we called his mother to see if she wanted to come with her husband for Christmas. His mother is 60 years old this year. That's when they told us they couldn't, that they had arranged with her ex-husband to visit him. Yes, I know how strange it sounds. She and her husband are best friends with her ex-husband. After a week, we called them again to see if they wanted to come at least for coffee in the afternoon. Especially since her ex-husband lives two doors down in the block of flats next to us.

Last week, she and us called again that we were going on a trip to see my family there on Saturday morning and back on Sunday early evening. The conversation on the phone was exceptionally pleasant and we ended it saying that after Christmas we would visit her and give her birthday presents or go to her ex-husband home and wish her a happy birthday there. After an hour from the end of the call, her husband texted my fiance something like this: How can you allow yourself to treat your mother like this? You're crazy, you treat her terribly and she's supposed to be 60. We're not at home for you, so don't call us and don't visit us.

My fiance wanted to reply to this message to her husband, but before he could, my mother's husband blocked him on Facebook from where he wrote to him. We immediately called him and wanted to ask what was going on. Instead, he picked it up and immediately put it down. We let the situation calm down, I thought it would calm down like all these manipulative episodes of hers. Instead, a few days later, she wrote this in short: I don't want any handouts and a loving play. We live twenty minutes from you, but you don't come, and if you do, you rush back home and only stay for a while. And that you need to rest after work? I won't be here forever and you act like this. You are a snob and behave terribly. You said yourself that you have a new family. So don't bother.

To put things in perspective. I am a teacher and my partner works 12 hour shifts at work. My fiance's mother still complains that we don't visit her enough. We visit my family 4 times a year, always for 2 to 3 days. There is no other way because of work. We go to his mother's house at least once a month, and during the summer break this year we visited their garden at least 6 times. His mother has health problems with her spine and is at risk of two surgeries. She was on drips and taking many medications. I understand that she is worried about her health, but she is exaggerating. Every time we want to come to them, she starts making excuses for not coming. For example: Don't drive Kate works in education. (Children have germs.) Don't go, we're not well. Don't go, you were on a trip in a bigger city and you will bring covid home to us. Etc.

On the other hand, she constantly blames us for not going to see them, when they themselves prevent us from doing so, and when we invite them, they don't come even though they are two doors away. We didn't do anything to them and yet we are always the bad ones. Even after we both celebrated our thirtieth birthdays this year. My fiance had a party planned that got canceled three times because of them. First because they were sick, second because mother's husband went to work abroad (they had debts and needed money) and third because they couldn't make it that weekend. Eventually we gave up and stopped asking. On my birthday they were invited to my family for a family celebration of my thirtieth birthday. A few days before leaving, they called us that mother's husband had health problems and they could not go with us. It even pissed me off and I'm a pretty calm person. They were supposed to go on vacation a week later. The day before leaving for my family, we went to their garden and asked them how they were doing and so on. We were told that on Friday (the day of my our travel) they would bring pebbles between the flower beds and that she and her husband would somehow transfer it to the flower beds. And again we were the bad ones for not helping them because we were going away. In the end, their vacation didn't work out because their dog got sick. (My fiance sad me that it was carma. :D)Ever since I met his mother, her health has gradually deteriorated and even her doctor has prescribed medication to calm her mental state. (She didnt take it.) She hasn't had an easy life, I understand that, but she can't treat us like this and expect us to shut up and not fight back.

Today, despite their warning (we are not at home for you), we went to wish her a happy birthday. We wrote to her that we were waiting in the parking lot and if we could come. We were actually standing below the house and waiting for what she would write. We heard the text ringing on her cell phone through the open window. They were at home, there was a light. We heard them talking about it upstairs, and after about 5 minutes, a text message written by her husband arrived saying they were not at home. (We recognized it because it was written in his language. He is from a different country than us.) We collected about $130 worth of gifts and went home. My fiancé couldn't stand it at home and wrote to her husband that he was writing to his mom and not to him and why is he still answering messages for her. And then he blocked his number to repay him for blocking him on Facebook. We went to see a netflix movie and that's when I started getting messages on my cell phone.

She wrote to me how can we afford to treat her husband like this and who wrote the SMS. That now they are arguing at home about it and that she wasn't home. She said she was at the pharmacy for her medication and he wrote the message for her. That she is not well, etc. Instead, I looked at her stories on Facebook, how she is smiling with a cake, taking pictures of a flower and a gift from him and looking very well and not sick as she constantly writes to us. During our relationship with them, we found out that his mother lies very often and chooses when she has time and when she doesn't want to go or do anything. We figured it about her due to the fact that when she was with my fiance's brother and his girlfriend she was gossiping about us and when she was with us she was gossiping about them She just didn't understand that we were having fun together and we would tell each other everything. She slandered her brother's girlfriend that she was a gold digger and that her son was under her influence. On the other hand, his mother claimed that I made up my nut allergies. (I choke and throw up after eating nuts and have other food allergies.) That I don't clean and my house is a mess and the worst part is that I'm fat. After my knee injury I gained 20 kilos and unfortunately I am not that lucky to lose it even if I try.

After I defended myself for the first time and shoved it in her face very politely that even if we try, we are still the bad ones and that we want to visit them but they always discourage us, she was silent for a while and then started again. No confession I did this and that. Instead, the same again, who wrote the message and how can we insult her husband like this. At the same time, he was the first to write us and threaten us not to go to them. Subsequently, I objected that half of the things she says are not even true, that they have changed and not us, and I have no idea what happened. And that if she wants something to my fiancé, she should write to me, because she is hurting him and I will not allow her to treat him like this. Subsequently, about an hour later, she wrote to my fiance this: Since you have been with Kate, you have changed and you are acting rudely to them. I hope you are not unreasonable and you can have comunicate with me as much as you want.

When threats didn't work, she tried questions, and when those didn't work either, she tried to destroy or disrupt our relationship. So what do you guys think. Am I really that terrible for standing up to this callous and toxic mother?

I counted my calories again and lost the weight, then I had mouth surgery (wisdom teeth removal) and lost weight tremendously bc I was addicted to the numbers going down (liquid diet) before then I gained 5 pounds bc it was mostly from muscle gain (I was very fit, at the time I cut my hair short to celebrate how strong I was) but I got scared of the numbers dropping too fast (I was at a normal healthy weight) so I let myself eat a burger… I became protein obsessed.. ate way too much beef.. I gained it all back and am officially obese.. I wasn’t allowed to go outside alone (I used to walk up hills for two hours a day and lift weights before the incident).

I had the UFE and a post-procedure nerve blocked performed.

Background: I'm a 31 y/o woman, never had kids, with 10+ subserosal / submucosal fibroids with the largest sitting on top of my uterus at 10cm+. Heavy periods that have gotten as long as 8-10 days.

Night Before Prep: I was told to not eat or drink (not even water) past midnight the night before the procedure. I shaved ""down there"" else they will do it for you if they are accessing through the groin. If your doctor is going to do radial (wrist) access don't worry about this but keep in mind nurses will still see you down there because they will place a foley catheter. I was told to not wear any jewelry but I took it with me for my mom to put on me afterwards because I hate being without it.

In-Hospital Pre-Procedure Prep: Arrived to the hospital 2 hours before the procedure time for prep. They told me to expect to stay overnight (I didn't - more about that later). My mom was with me and they let her come back to the overnight room with me. 

They did the following in the room that I was told I would be staying in overnight:

* Drew my blood. Since I hadn't eaten, I nearly passed out needed to lay down.
* Had me change into a hospital gown and put socks and a warm blanket on me.
* Placed a foley catheter. I tried to refuse this but they said it was necessary. 
* Placed an IV. Nearly passed out again. 
* Placed a anti-nausea patch behind my ear (more on this below)
* Took my blood pressure.

Procedure: 

* They rolled me in the bed I was already laying in in the overnight room to the OR. They had me scooch onto the operating table and strapped me in and put a warm blanket on me. They made me so comfortable. 
* The attending doctor, the fellow (5th year student), a nurse and two techs were in the OR.
* The attending doctor spoke to me before they sedated me and they did a safety time out. They should read off your name, birthdate and the procedure to be performed. If anything doesn't sound right, speak up.
* They told me they were going to sedate me and injected through the already placed IV port. I immediately felt relaxed.
* My memory went in and out after this. I felt no pain until the very end (next bullet) I do not remember them making the incision. I do remember speaking to the fellow doctor as he was performing the procedure. I remember also speaking to the attending doctor and asking him if the fibroids had started feeding off my ovaries (something I was afraid of since I had a bigger fibroid) and he said they had not.
* After the procedure was done (1.5 hours) I remember a third doctor walking up to me and introducing himself as the doctor that would perform my nerve block. As was told to me, the past 150ish procedures they have been doing this nerve block so that you are completely numb to any pain in my abdomen for about 6-8 hours after the procedure. They use a needle and inject some medicine below your belly button. I remember this hurting and me crying, but it was quick and then I felt no pain.

Post-Procedure:

* I was rolled back to my room where my mom was waiting for me. I felt high and happy, must have been the drugs. My mom got me my first coffee of the day and some food. I felt so good. I was texting and calling people. I saw the messages after and didn't remember them lol.
* They put me on bed rest for 4 hours. I asked them to immediately remove the foley catheter and they did then gave me a bed pan just in case.
* They gave me a PCA pump with Dilaudid for pain but I didn't feel the need to press it. 
* The attending and fellow checked on me a few times. The attending said I looked so good that I could go home same day if I wanted to. They gave me some prescription pain meds and made sure I could pee on my own.
* I was just given medications (listed below) with no pain management plan other than the recommended doses on the bottles
* **I went home. It was a mistake.**

First Night:

* After getting home and going to bed, the cramps started coming on after the nerve block wore off. The pain was so bad. I've never had a kid but I imagine this is what labor pains are like. I was crying and sobbing. My only relief was the heating pad and I took one Percocet. Barely slept.
* Had I stayed in the hospital, I would have had the PCA pump and not had any pain.

Day 1 Post Procedure:

* I was in moderate to severe pain most of the day. I took another Percocet and alternated with 800 mg ibuprofen.
* I had the heating pad on me constantly. The cramps were in my abdomen, sides, inner thighs. Be careful because I got a mark on my skin from using the heating pad so much.
* Could not stand for more than 1 min. Went from bed to couch to toilet.
* Little to no appetite.
* Barely slept at night, woke up in a lot of pain in the middle of the night, cramps were so bad. Crying again.

Day 2 Post Procedure:

* Woke up with blurry near vision, couldn't read anything. Freaked out. Turns out I had touched the anti-nausea patch and then touched my eyes. Don't do that. It resolved on its own a day later.
* **EXCRUCIATING PAIN**: This is when the pain got BAD about midday. I got to the point where I was gonna lose my mind if I wasn't given more pain medication. I felt like an addict. Finally got on the phone with the doctor and he said I could take 2 Percocet and 2 Toradol and then 1 - 2 Percocet and 1 Toradol every 6 hours. I immediately felt stable and could lay down comfortably.
* Pain woke me up again at night but it was not as bad. 

Day 3 Post Procedure:

* Woke up with cramps but pain started to decrease. I was worried because I was running out of Percocet, but I started alternating Tylenol 1000mg and Toradal 10mg every 3 hours and that worked well. 
* Pain was on and off all day.
* Couldn't stand much. Felt very tired. Appetite was starting to come back.
* Slept ok but pain woke me up at 6 am. Was not as intense as previous nights but it was bad enough to make me doubt if I was gonna ever start feeling better.

Day 4 Post Procedure:

* Continued alternating the Tylenol and Toradol every 3 hours. Worked so well. 
* Finally got my appetite back and ate a proper meal. 
* First shower in 5 days. Detangled my hair with a spray bottle and spray conditioner while sitting on my bed and then sat on a chair in the shower as a precaution in case I got light headed. Made sure someone was in the house before taking a shower. 
* **Spontaneously, the pain subsided**. I was in a good mood again. I could walk. I even felt like cooking so I did. I was feeling so good and couldn't believe my pain was gone.

Medications Prescribed:

* Percocet 5-325 mg (lowest dose)
* Toradol 10 mg
* Zofran for nausea
* Ibuprofen 800mg
* Acetaminophen 325mg

**Summary**: Assuming the procedure was successful, I don't regret it. If I were to do it again, I would definitely stay the night in the hospital and make the doctor give me a pain management plan before leaving. I would also not leave without the doctors cell phone number (it was very hard to get a hold of him when I was dying of pain). Make sure there is someone who can be with you post recovery. Plan on not leaving the house for 5 days at least. 

I will post an update in 3 months after my followup visit!

**TL;DR**: I am 4 days post UFE procedure, procedure was painless, I was given a nerve block post procedure. I should have stayed the night so that I could have access to a PCA pump for pain once the nerve block wore off but I went home and it was a mistake. The first 3 days were excruciatingly painful with cramps and I had barely any appetite and slept very little. Make sure your doctor gives you an adequate pain management plan before you go home. Day 4 and I feel almost no pain and was able to walk around the house and cook today.",6,1734921188.0,Fibroids,2,1.0,False

I’m going through a bit of a rough patch and just wanted to get this off my chest. It’s been one thing after another lately - caught a bad cold few weeks back, had my money stolen, and then just yesterday, the girl I was dating broke up with me 💔 It’s been... rough, to say the least.

I know the holiday season is supposed to be cheerful and uplifting, but honestly, all the festivities around me are making it harder to deal with everything. I’m feeling pretty low right now, and I guess I’m just looking for a bit of connection.

Subjects I like drawing are usually woman, dogs, older senior citizen age men that are a bit stylish in dress, people doing something mundane like drinking coffee/reading newspaper, trains and urban landscapes.

Most of those are easy to do but I don't like like to approach woman randomly in the street so I'd rather hire someone and I know there various people hire services in Tokyo. Which would be the most appropriate hire service if there is one?

It would just be the person sitting for a portrait for about 15 minutes in a coffee shop or something then have a quick photo taken holding the drawing but I'd be happy to pay for an hour or two to make it worth their time.

I'd imagine it would be a bit time consuming and not simple to hire from a model agency and I'm just in Tokyo for 6 days, and I don't need a professional model. Is there a more straight forward service that you know of? Thanks.",1,1734921049.0,TokyoTravel,0,1.0,False

I went to target to get two items. After I checked out I remembered that I had some money on my starbucks card, I waited in line, ordered, then waited for my drink. I ordered a grande, blonde vanilla latte with oak milk. 

After I ordered, I saw there were four drinks ahead of my order. Those four drinks were made and the people got their order. So my order should be next. No, it was not. The five orders placed after my order were all made and those people got their drinks, there were eight drinks between the five orders. I’d been waiting there for fifteen mins now, and twelve drinks had been made. 

 (About five minutes waiting for my drink, I started getting nauseous and very unwell feeling. I realize now afterward that it was sensory overload: colognes, perfumes, excessive noise. It was so overwhelming that I couldn’t move, so I wasn’t able to put my ear plugs in)

The barista started making a thirteenth drink and then the barista who originally took my order got back from their break. When the barista saw the other barista get back from break, they immediately started making my drink. 

When they finished making my drink, they slid the drink away from their work area and started cleaning the counters. The other barista stared at them for a moment and then immediately called my name out to pick up my order. After I picked up my order, the barista stopped cleaning and returned to making drinks. The barista who had been on their break seemed to be genuinely confused at why I had just gotten my order. 

I’m so confused why this happens to me so often. I had my order placed quickly after it was my turn, I practiced my order silently to myself and knew what I was getting, I knew how much it was going to cost and was prepared to pay immediately after ordering. I was kind and spoke clearly to the barista when placing my order, I didn’t stand too close to anyone in line, I waited my turn without any complaints, and I was still somewhat punished for some reason. I get so much anxiety when I’m overlooked that I can’t speak for myself, I just go nonverbal and freeze. 

After I left I was gaslighting myself into believing they’d run out of supplies or something else. That was completely false, more than half of the orders requested oat milk and they’d plenty in their fridges. The cups were stocked, they didn’t have to wait on coffee, espresso, all ingredients were stocked and available. ",2,1734920941.0,autism,1,1.0,False

For the last year, I've had elevated liver enzymes. They're not so high I'm being referred to anyone to address them. 

My provider told me that energy drinks can cause this. She told me after taking pre-workout for a month, she saw her own liver enzymes become elevated. Is this right? 

I drink one energy drink a day. On rare occasions I'll have a second one or a coffee in the afternoons. Three or four days a week, I take a pre-workout. I'll still have the energy drink for those days. 

I'm curious if this is a reasonable cause. It's a VA provider, and I'm not very confident in her. I don't feel like I'm abusing either substance. 

This post is to satisfy my curiosity until I can schedule an appointment with a dietitian. Along with elevated liver enzymes, my A1C is trending up, so I want to get a handle on my diet before it gets any worse. 

I don't believe there are any other reasons for my liver to be elevated. I drink alcohol monthly or less, never more than two drinks in a sitting. I didn't have any alcohol in the days leading up to any of the three blood tests that have flagged high liver enzymes.

1hkduul,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1hkduul/boss_stealing_wages/,boss stealing wages,"Hi Legal Reddit,

I started working at a Chinese owned coffee shop in Philly a little over a month ago, and I can safely say my boss has no idea what the labor laws are. When I first started working there, they had a “policy” where they take $20 from your paycheck if you are 15 minutes late and $50 from your paycheck if you are over 30 minutes late (we only get $8 an hour to begin with). They have done this to their Chinese-American employees many, many times, and they stole almost $400 from my roommate for late fees. I feel really bad because the Chinese international college students that work there likely do not know their labor rights. I have a working proficiency in Chinese, so I explained to them that this is illegal, and the boss repaid my roommate her stolen wages, but she has likely not done this for the other workers. 

I thought everything would be fine after that, but I got my paycheck for 94 hours and was not paid overtime for the 14 hours over 80. I asked my boss about it and said to her that if she can’t pay me and her other current employees backpay for the overtime wages we are due, I will quit by Feb 1st. She called me in a panic saying that she can’t afford to pay us overtime, and if we don’t want to work more than 40 hours we don’t have to. She said employees work overtime because they can’t afford their living expenses on just 40 hours, so she allows them to work more than that. I explained to her that that is fine, but she is legally required to pay 1.5x the base pay for anything over 40 hours a week. She said she can’t afford to do this. 

To my understanding, it’s not about whether the overtime hours are voluntary or mandatory, they still have to be paid time and a half. She will likely not be paying me or anyone else overtime. Also, I am concerned for the labor rights of my coworkers because they only get paid via Venmo and do not receive paystubs, so they can’t report the wage theft if they wanted to. What should I do? Should I report this to the Philadelphia department of labor?  Would I need a lawyer?

Thank you for your help, and I can provide the “employee handbook” if needed. (It’s really just a random document that their one employee/manager/college student typed up.) 

EDIT: I feel the worst for the woman who makes the sandwiches at the shop. She works every single day from 7 AM - 4 PM, and I know for a fact she isn’t getting overtime pay for hours over 40/week. I tried to talk with her earlier today and tell her I don’t think the boss pays her enough, but she refused and said $8/hour is good, and it’s hard to find a job for her. She is being taken advantage of the most. If anything comes out of this, I want the boss to have to pay her more. ",7,1734920401.0,legal,4,0.89,False

La Grande Orange is one of those places you go when you want a fun dining trip. It's a pizzeria restaurant connected with a bakery/coffee shop and a niche market. It's a lot to take in, but it's super cute. They have a ton of great desserts and a case of gelato on the bakery side. The restaurant menu consists of pizzas, salads, and similar foods. You can order food to-go or dine in. The market has gift items, toys, trinkets, books, and the works. It gives me the vibes of a kichy tourist store for sure. But it's kind of buried in the Scottsdale/Biltmore/Central region, which is not exactly an easy drive-by for visitors. It's the kind of place you go to if you've heard of it or know what it is. It's pretty unassuming by the exterior, I wouldn't stop by to check it out just driving by. I found this place when I was deep dive searching for different pizzerias in the valley. The pizzas are really good. Greasy as all get out, like where you might wanna dab a napkin on it beforehand. And if you don't let it set just a bit, the weight of the toppings will laugh at the thin crust. My friend says the best way to judge a pizzeria is by its cheese pizza. At $17, La Grande's cheese pizza is good, not great. The rest of their pizzas, loaded with a good spread of toppings (they don't skimp with the toppings, we love to see it) are priced around $19. I'm not sure why a simple base model cheese pizza would be only $2 cheaper than the rest of the artisan pizzas. For like $12, it would be a great cheese pizza. At $17, it's a cheese pizza. I had a seasonal pizza with goat cheese, sundried tomatoes, artichokes, another thing or two, and I added fennel sausage. I don't remember everything that was on it but that pizza alone made the entire bill and trip worth it. I felt how Ratatouille must've felt eating the cheese and strawberry together. The flavors sang in my mouth and the world faded away. It was actually that good. From the bakery side, the gelato was good and the red velvet cake was phenomenal. Expensive, but worth a trip.

Holy Cow, this place. So many things to say about this place. First of all, the parking is abysmal. Definitely recommend parking in the front part of the lot or a neighboring lot. If you try and park behind the building everything gets real tight and you'll ask yourself if this is actually a parking spot or not. Awesome, you found decent parking and walked up to the building. Good luck getting inside. For the life of me, I could not find the front door. Maybe I couldn't decipher the door because it was dark and during the day it's easier to find? The front of the building is covered in vines and leaves and such. The door is also covered in vines and leaves. If you look hard enough, you'll find the door handle sticking out. The space inside is relatively small. The area in the above photo, there's a bar top area with a couple of tables to the right of this photo on the other side of a wall, and there's some seating outside. We were greeted by Daniel who informed us it would be an hour and 45 minute wait. It's a popular place, we had suspected there would be a wait. Daniel took our name down and I asked if he wanted my number to call me when it was ready. To which he informed me that they don't call patrons when a table opens up. He recommended that most guests wait at the bar next door. When a table opens up, they walkie-talkie over to the bartenders, then the bartender will call your name out and let you know a table is ready. I was flabbergasted. What an interesting concept. Not bad by any means, quite genius if you ask me.  You can't just get onto the waiting list and then disappear. Glai partners with their neighbor to create a unique specialized user experience. They communicate with the bartenders via walkie-talkie? Are you kidding me? That's so sick. We ended up going somewhere else and when we got back, we went in to see if our table was ready. Daniel immediately recognized us and we got sat. Our waiter, Will, was fabulous. Their menu is very small, great to alleviate that decision paralysis. I asked Will if he could surprise me with a dish that didn't have dairy or spice in it. He brought out Pad kee mao, a noodle dish with fried pork belly that was delicious. It did have a chili in it, but I just pulled it out. My friend got Panang curry, a chunk of braised beef with a side of rice. We also got the mango sticky rice. The rice was pretty much the consistency of oatmeal but tasted like rice. It was rice and a slice of mango in a little coconut milk. It was so good. The mango was perfectly ripe and the flavors were just fabulous. I get the hype now. The staff was all super nice, the food was banging, and the exclusivity factor made me feel fancy.
