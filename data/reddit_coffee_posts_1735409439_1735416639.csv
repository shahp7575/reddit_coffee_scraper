1hoe0xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hoe0xw/i_just_want_to_be_nap_trapped_again/,I just want to be nap trapped again,"My daughter is 8 weeks and 2 days old. The first seven weeks she has slept on my chest or her father’s or her siblings for hours at a time every day. We have been patting our backs congratulating ourselves for her being such an easy baby thinking this is because she gets so much closeness and safety. She would spend all morning until noon asleep on me while I lied on the couch watching shows and eating sandwiches, drinking coffee from a thermos not to spill on her. Perfection. And the last week it has all unraveled. She has been increasing harder to soothe and get to sleep and slept for shorter and shorter intervals. Yesterday was awful and today was worse. She hardly slept at all not even in the stroller or car. Just for 5 or 10 minutes. Definitely not in my arms no matter what. Not at the breast, she just gets hysterical, not latching and kicking and flaying her arms like crazy. And tonight she cried like she never has before, inconsolable. I have no idea what’s wrong, how long it’ll last or what to do. It’s like she has become too aware of everything around her to turn her attention off and relax, but she is only 8 weeks old, how can she have outgrown contact naps when I see videos of people contact napping their five year old still? I don’t know how to help her get the sleep she needs. Even if she is so full of milk it is basically squirting out her ears and she’s so tired she’s all red around her eyes, and I’m rocking her in my arms for an hour, she won’t sleep. And she used to just fall asleep on my shoulder while I was just sitting on the couch or walking around the house. I feel so useless for not being able to help her and all sense of accomplishment as a parent just flew out the window. ",1,1735416418.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

1hodye3,https://www.reddit.com/r/EatTheRich/comments/1hodye3/blue_cross_blue_shield_of_arkansas/,Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas ,"This was originally posted to r/Healthinsurance and quickly was removed.

About 15 or so years ago I was working on a construction project at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arkansas which is strangely located in Rhode Island (or at least I thought it was strange at the time).

The project lasted at least several weeks, but I was only there for a few days.

The building was occupied at the time, with a sheet of black plastic separating the construction crew from the insurance employees.

They could hear us and we could hear them but we couldn't see each other.

They would speak to each other about the claims they denied, and the fact that they knew the sick and the injured were in fact entitled to the care they were denying with such a disregard to human decency that we were shocked.

They would pick randomly perfectly fine claims and deny them as some sort of game and then talk to each other about it as casually as your average person would talk about how they like their coffee.

It seemed like they would receive some kind of compensation for their efforts to cause physical and financial pain and suffering among their membership, but that was not confirmed.

Looking back, it made perfect sense that they were located far away from Arkansas. If the employees thought of their members as their neighbors, they would be less likely to deny their claims.

To those of you that are working on this industry, we ARE your neighbors.  We see and feel what you are doing to us and the ones we care for.

And we have had enough.

1hodww3,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1hodww3/sending_this_to_an_friend_i_wish_to_reconnect/,Sending this to an friend I wish to reconnect? After 3 years ,"Hi Stephanie,

I know it’s been a long time, but this really is me—Over the past few years, I’ve been working hard on my physical and mental well-being, and those changes have led me to reflect on a lot, including our connection. Recently, I came across an old photo you sent me, and it brought back so many memories of our unique friendship.

I’ve waited this long to reach out because I wanted to respect your need for space, and looking back, I can see why taking a break was necessary for both of us. I cared about your well-being then, and I still do now. I’m reaching out because I feel the timing is finally right, and circumstances have changed—like the distance, which was a big factor in our past challenges. I’d really love the chance to reconnect, to catch up, and to get to know each other again—this time without the barriers that made things hard before.

Before anything, though, I want to apologize for how I handled things back then. I know I overwhelmed you, and I regret that deeply. I wasn’t fully aware of how my words and actions affected you, and I see now that I put unnecessary pressure on you. My feelings were genuine, but I didn’t communicate them in a healthy way, and that’s something I’ve worked hard to understand and improve.

Looking back, I realize I craved a deeper connection with you, but instead of building it the right way, I pushed too hard and made things harder for both of us. For that, I’m truly sorry. Taking time apart gave me the chance to reflect and grow, and I now see how important it is to truly listen and approach relationships with patience and understanding.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to meet up for coffee or lunch sometime to reconnect and catch up. No pressure at all—just an invitation if it feels right to you

  
Is it too long or just right.. she's an infj btw. I really would like to start fresh start but I feel like i needed to apologize.. context for letter we where friends in hs lived in separate cities only texted for 6 years til she requested space.

The recipes I found online said to use 1 vanilla bean per 1 cup of sugar. Since I wanted to make quite a bit, I poured 10 cups of sugar into an airtight container and added 10 chopped up vanilla beans. I shook it up a few times a day. I opened it this morning and it doesn't smell nice. It smells....I dunno...medicinal (?) 

Anyway, I put it in the coffee bean grinder to chop up the vanilla evenly and added some to my morning coffee. It tastes fine. Sweet and vanilla-y. But smells not so great. Is this normal? I was expecting to smell like vanilla - not vanilla flavored medicine :P 

Can I salvage this batch somehow?
Is that just too much vanilla? Wondering if I can fix it by adding more sugar. Vanilla beans are kinda pricey and I really hate to waste stuff.

Is it too soon to know if the relationship is viable long-term?,"So I met this guy on a dating app on the 5th this month. We went on our first date and everything was great, just a normal coffee date. The second and third dates went well, and about 10 days in we decided to snooze the dating apps. In retrospect, I think it was a little too fast to do so. 

Last Sunday he asked if he could be my boyfriend and I said no because I needed more time (at that point I had only known him for 16 days). He's currently out of town for the holidays and we've been calling every night. 

He's really kind, we get along well, and we have similar interests. There aren't really any negative qualities that I've noticed, I just feel like our energies/“the vibe"" could align better. 

We do banter a little bit and things like that but his energy is a little more laid back whereas mine can be a bit more chaotic at times. We're both introverts so that might contribute to it. It's not that he's hard to talk to it's just the energy is very chill and that's fine, I just feel like we could mesh better if that makes sense?

In past relationships I really enjoyed roasting each other, bantering often, inside jokes, things like that. It's only been a few weeks but I'm still unsure of if I want a relationship with him at this point and I'm just trying to decide.

TL;DR
Been talking to this guy for less than a month and I like him but I'm not sure how viable a long-term relationship would be due to our different energies. I'm trying to figure out if something long-term would work out",2,1735415829.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

Best feeling ever because I have struggled with hair loss due to pcos and thyroid. The only thing I added to my diet is Hibiscus tea. 

I ordered very high quality hibiscus tea from Etsy just for the love of tea not expecting anything more and so glad I did. 

I think how I make the tea is a big part of its effectiveness. I bought hibiscus flower petals whole which I grind in the coffee grinder in very small batches (2-3 time use). I boil water, add the tea and let it boil for a min then add the same amount of cold water to the pot and then let the whole thing sit overnight. Then I drink that big batch throughout the next day. I think this process brings out all the goodness of the tea (no scientific proof, just my feeling)

Viva la Dirt League has officially Skycraftmon Evolved into.... VIVA+!

No longer a scrappy little comedy troupe scrambling to make skits amid rock and rubble, VIVA is now an established, award winning  production studio with their very own VIVA+ app!

But with these new changes, there have been so many more changes on top of those changes! So many upgrades! So many new stories and one shots and genres - all in a single year!

So what came out in 2024?

So many series including ADHD+Me, ADHD+Me Podcast, Between Two Turns Season 3, Bored, Cost of Living, D&D Logic Season 2, DEV, Epic NPC Man, Office Logic, PUBG, Survival Logic S2, Tales of the Misfits, We Were Told.... Podcast, and so many Wildcards, shorts, streams, and one-offs.

PLUS

VIVA+ with all of these VIVA+ shows including Backstage, Bloopers,  Honey I Shrunk the Peasants, ImproVIVA, Ryoko, Techtown Middle Ages, Voice Over Actor/Berry Season 2, etc.

2024 is a list and a half.

During the past year, VIVA fully utilized the green screen WITH wire work,  dabbled in Improv, dropped kick ass merch, experimented in new genres, published the successful Hero Outage comic book, attended their first US con at New York Comic Con, Adam's pink shorts and stripper heels, created sentient life in cyberspace, created the White Shirt Saga, played Where's Alan during the White Shirt Saga, birthed Li'l Greg, hunted vampires, did multiple collabs and crossovers, won awards for the ADHD+Me podcast...

AND dropped the VIVA+ app.

Not a bad haul for an entire year's worth of work.

To all of the VIVA workers, helpers, friends and supporters, thank you for helping creating amazing, funny, poignant, silly comedy skits that entertain and help people around the world. 

None of this happens without you guys. 

It's all hard work, it's all crazy nonsense. Whether it was rendering CGI, created costumes and props and weapons, helped with stunts and safety, fixed bugs, typed out subtitles, edited scenes, answered phones, replied to emails, answered questions, delivered lunch, made tea/coffee/hot water, fixed fandom problems, set up scenes, moved furniture, typed lines, taped tape somewhere, spooled and unspooled wires, and everything else...

We might not see all of you, but we see your amazing accomplishments and hard work at VIVA, and the fandom appreciates all of it.

And with that, 2025 is upon us in a few days. As great as 2024 has been, 2025 will be even better! 

Over the next year, VIVA will drop the Witcher Logic Season 2, FPS Season 2, Mental Health Season 2, Sims Logic, We Were Told.... Podcast Season 2, brand new D&D series, AND finally the fan favorited and fan demanded: The Quest for Greta Series!

VIVA+ will also be getting a massive upgrade along with new exclusives including fan favorite Techtown Middle Ages Season 2, Voice Booth Season 3, and so much more!

There will also be new merch, books, dice, songs, extras, perks, bonuses, maps, bag, and the brand new Epic NPC Man: Nice Day for Fishing Video Game will be coming out soon! 

With this year-in-review of 2024, VIVA has created yet another banner year of great and wonderful shows and things, lots of laughs and love, lots of goofiness, lots of fandom celebrations and milestones hit. We in the fandom look forward to more experimenting, more jokes, more pushing boundaries, more expressive moments, more improv, more highlights, and positive growth, and can see that 2025 will be VIVA's best year yet.

1hodgj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1hodgj0/led_lights_triggering_seizures/,LED lights triggering seizures?,"Hi all,

This is my first time posting here (or on Reddit at all haha). I would be really grateful for some advice regarding what is triggering my seizures, as I was only recently diagnosed and still feel quite in the dark about it, and anxious as I don't know what situations/triggers to avoid. I'm a 22 year old woman and had my first seizure (tonic clonic) this July while at work-- I work as a barista/waitress at a fairly busy coffee shop. I have since had three other seizures, all tonic clonic, and all at work. I am taking lamotrigine, 200mg a day. None of my seizures occurred on especially stressful days or when I was very tired or anything. I started this job in June, so shortly before my first seizure, and have never had a seizure outside work.

I had my most recent (fourth) seizure yesterday, and I'm starting to suspect it's the lights in my workplace that are the trigger. The reason for this is that, weirdly, all my seizures happened in the exact same place (as in, like two square feet) in my workplace. I work under very bright, naked LED lights and have had all my seizures while working at the coffee machine (rather than on the cafe floor or in the kitchen, where I would say I spend an equal amount of time) which is almost directly under a very bright light, so you can kind of see it while looking ahead. I often glance up and down while working in order to greet customers or grab mugs from a shelf above me. Two people who witnessed my seizures on different occasions said they started while I was looking up. 

So I suppose my question is: can seizures be triggered just by looking into a bright LED light? Has this happened to anyone else? Could it be that on these four occasions I had been catching glimpses of the light at intervals that triggered some kind of photosensitive reaction? It's all a bit weird, as I have obviously got through hundreds of work days where I'm doing the same work but don't have a seizure, and I have encountered LED lights pretty much every day of my life until this year without having a seizure. 

Sorry for the long anecdotal post! Like I say, I'm feeling quite shaken at the moment what with the new diagnosis and the lack of clarity surrounding the trigger, so I would be grateful to know if anyone has experienced anything similar or thinks this sounds plausible at all.

1hodd2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstatePicMarket/comments/1hodd2n/living_room_preparation_fluff_straighten_and/,"Living Room Preparation – Fluff, Straighten, and Declutter for Maximum Impact","The living room is often the heart of the home. It’s where buyers picture themselves lounging after work, hosting friends, or spending quality time with family. In real estate photography, the living room has to feel warm, inviting, and—above all—clutter-free. Let’s face it: no one wants to imagine themselves in a messy space.

Today, we’ll walk through the essential steps to getting that perfect living room shot. Spoiler alert: it involves a lot of fluffing, straightening, and removing those everyday items that make a room look, well, *lived in.*

# The Living Room Prep Checklist

1. **Straighten the Furniture** You might think that furniture already looks fine, but remember: photos exaggerate every little detail. A slightly crooked couch or uneven armchair arrangement will stand out more than you think. Make sure all the furniture is aligned just right. If you need to shift pieces to make the space look more open, go for it! The living room should feel spacious and functional in photos.
2. **Fluff Pillows & Fold Blankets** Think of pillows and throws like the accessories of your living room—they add style and personality, but only when used thoughtfully. Pillows should be fluffed and arranged symmetrically (or with just enough asymmetry to look deliberate). Blankets should be neatly folded or, better yet, stashed away. You want your seating areas to look inviting, not like a blanket fort gone wrong.
3. **Free of Pet Hair & Personal Items** We love our furry friends, but potential buyers don’t want to see evidence of pets when they’re browsing photos. Use a lint roller on upholstered furniture to remove pet hair, and make sure toys, food dishes, or scratching posts are out of sight. The same goes for personal items: TV remotes, half-read books, and family photos need to disappear, at least for the shoot. The goal is to make the space feel universal so that anyone can picture themselves living there.
4. **Clear & Clean Surfaces** Coffee tables, end tables, and shelves should be free of clutter. If you’ve got magazines, knick-knacks, or random décor pieces taking up space, they need to go. Less is more in real estate photography. A clean, open table or surface gives the illusion of more space and keeps the viewer’s attention on the room’s best features.
5. **Clean & Tidy Floors** Whether it’s hardwood, carpet, or tile, your living room floor needs to be spotless. Sweep, mop, vacuum, or do whatever it takes to remove dust, pet hair, and debris. If you’ve got area rugs, give them a good shake or vacuum and make sure they’re perfectly positioned.
6. **Light Fixtures in Working Order** Good lighting is the key to great photos, so make sure all bulbs are working and at their brightest. Dust off lamps, ceiling fixtures, and fan blades to avoid distracting smudges or cobwebs in the background of your shot.

# Real-World Example: When Decluttering Saved the Day

We once had a client who was prepping their living room for a shoot but couldn’t bear to part with all their personal items. The coffee table was stacked with magazines, remotes, and even a bowl of half-eaten cereal (yikes!). We gently explained that clutter not only distracts but also makes a room feel smaller and messier than it actually is. After a quick decluttering session, the room looked twice as big, and the photos practically sold the house by themselves.

# Activity: Stage Your Living Room Like a Pro

Take 10 minutes and stand in your living room. Pretend you’re a buyer walking into the space for the first time. What catches your eye? Is there too much stuff on the coffee table? Does the couch look slouched? Write down three small changes you could make to create a cleaner, more inviting space. Then, put those changes into action and see how it transforms the room!

# Discussion Question: Why Does Clutter Make a Room Feel Smaller?

Clutter has a way of making even the largest rooms feel cramped. Why do you think that is? Discuss the psychological effect of clutter on buyers and how it impacts their ability to imagine the space as their own.

Fast forward we match again on the same dating site and he messaged me to meet up and catch up! I think great, why not we had lots of things in common last time we spoke. 
We end up meeting up for coffee again and it’s great. Theirs physical attraction and good conversation. He ends up in outing me over that night 8pm to his place to watch a movie to which I decline since it’s too late and last minute. The next day I agree to come over to watch a show together and hang out. We lay down and he ends up getting touchy feely to which I ignore his advances. The night ends and I end up saying goodbye and going home. We are still texting at this point and two days later he invites me over to his place and orders us dinner and same story we end up watching a movie and he gets touchy feely again and I ignore his advances but end the night by giving him a kiss to let him know I’m interested but at my own pace. 
Again a day later I come over to his place and he gets us dinner and we hang out to watch another movie. This time same story but I end up giving in and we make out on the couch. He did begin to slide his hand down my cheeks to which I said no and he respected my answer. We end the night chatting having tea all is well… 
Anywho this is where it gets weird… we’re still texting and Christmas Eve rolls around and no text.. so I take the chance and text him at 6ish pm Merry Xmas eve and he replies with a nice answer and responsive. I text him back the following morning and I haven’t heard back since. It’s been 4 days since he’s texted me and I think I’m going crazy.

By day, it’s buzzing with life—call centers, tech hubs, cafes. But by night, the buildings loom like silent giants, their lights flickering as if they’re alive. And in one particular building, **Tower 13**, people whispered stories.



I never believed in ghosts until I took the night shift at **Tech Solutions**, a BPO in Tower 13. As a Team Lead, I was used to managing late-night shifts, calming irate clients, and boosting my team’s morale. But this night? It was anything but ordinary.



It started with the **disappearing coffee cups**. You’d make yourself a cup, turn around for a second, and it’d vanish. Then came the **whispers**—indistinct murmurs in the break room even when it was empty.



“Just tricks of the mind,” I told myself.



But then, Ravi, one of my team members, burst into the main office looking pale as chalk.



“Bhai… there’s someone in the server room,” he stammered.



We checked the cameras. Sure enough, there was a **figure dressed in white**, walking around aimlessly in the server room. But here’s the twist: the **building was locked**, and our ID access logs showed no one entered the room.



“Let’s check it out,” I said, trying to sound braver than I felt.



Ravi and I grabbed a cricket bat (because, of course, Indian solutions to everything) and headed for the server room. The corridor leading there felt **colder than usual**, the fluorescent lights flickering ominously.



When we opened the door, the room was empty—but not entirely. A foul stench hit us, and the air felt… heavy. I turned on my flashlight, scanning the room, when suddenly, the door slammed shut behind us.



Ravi screamed. “What the hell, man?!”



Before I could reply, the lights in the room started flickering violently, and a **shadowy figure materialized** in front of us. It was a woman with hollow eyes, her face twisted in rage.



“LEAVE THIS PLACE!” she shrieked, her voice echoing unnaturally.



Ravi fainted. Great.



I’m not exactly a fighter, but adrenaline makes you do crazy things. I swung the cricket bat, but it passed right through her. She laughed, a chilling sound that made my skin crawl.



“You think you can fight me?” she sneered.



I noticed something. Every time she moved closer to the servers, the temperature dropped further, and the systems started glitching. Whatever this ghost wanted, it was tied to the servers.



Then I remembered the old chaiwala’s story. He once mentioned that **Tower 13 was built over a graveyard** and that a young woman had died there under mysterious circumstances. Could it be her?



I had no plan, but I started talking. “Who are you? What do you want?”



The ghost paused, her anger flickering for a moment. “They took everything from me… my life, my peace. This place is cursed.”



Piece by piece, I got her story. She was **Aarti**, a software engineer who had worked in the same building years ago. She had been wrongfully fired and later died in a car accident near the office. Her soul, she claimed, was tied to the servers where she had spent countless nights working.



I needed to end this. But how?



Then it hit me: **the servers.** If her spirit was connected to them, maybe shutting them down could sever the tie.



I called for backup. The remaining team rushed to the control room. Meanwhile, I stayed in the server room, stalling the ghost as she grew more aggressive.



“Do you think killing us will bring you peace?” I shouted.



“Silence!” she roared, her shadow form growing larger.



Finally, the servers powered down. The room plunged into silence. The ghost let out a terrible scream, her form starting to fade. “You… have freed me,” she whispered before disappearing into a wisp of light.



When the lights came back on, the air felt lighter, the room warmer. Ravi woke up, groaning, “What happened?”



“Just another night at the office,” I said, laughing nervously.



The next day, I filed a resignation. No way was I staying in that building. But before I left, I made sure to light a diya and say a prayer for Aarti.



Now, whenever I pass Tower 13, I wonder if she’s truly at peace—or if she’s still watching over the servers, waiting for someone to listen to her story.

  


**TL;DR**: Took a night shift at a BPO in Gurgaon’s infamous Tower 13, only to encounter a ghost haunting the server room. Turns out, she was a wronged employee tied to the servers. After shutting them down, her spirit was freed. Resigned the next day. 👻

Don't leave, stay and ride it out,  you owe it to your family and the man's family. Etc....

Mga GEN X naman, hay nako, my mom is a GEN X and let me tell you, growing up, she was never around. We lived in the province and she worked in Manila. She had her parents (my Lolo and lola) raise me. She was emotionally unavailable for me. I had to discover a lot of things by my self. When I started having children of my own, she's very quick and often gives me unsolicited advice on how to raise my children. I can't even effing defend my self or my personal choices in life because no matter what I do or say, her opinion is always superior.

As a millennial naman, being anxious is my toxic trait. I always think the worst will happen and I actively avoid the public and people because dealing with the general population is exhausting. I can't keep friends because I always over think and doubt their intentions. I'm way too critical of my self.

1hod3rq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hod3rq,1940s Blatt Chicago A3,"This one is very dear to me.

This is an A3 style bomber jacket made by Blatt of Chicago. I don't have an exact date for it, but I know it's post-war 1940s. Front quarter horsehide throughout, all the original hardware still intact. 

It once belonged to my great-grand father's best friend. He was in the Canadian airforce, joining up right after the war. He was a mechanic and as the story goes he bought this for himself as his ""air force jacket"", when he wasn't issued one (apparently mechanics didn't get them). When he died, the jacket went to my great grandfather, who then passed it to my grandfather, and then down to me. 

She isn't in mint condition, but that's to be expected from an eighty year old garment. There is some wear in the lining and on some of the pocket stitching. I've avoided doing much of anything to this jacket. I won't condition it, it doesn't need that as the leather is still soft and supple. Besides which, I'm in love with the patina. 

I appreciate so many things about this jacket. The cuffs and trim are handwoven wool, as it predates ribbed cuffs. The pockets are hand stitched into the inner lining to keep them in place. The entire back panel is one single piece, and is the softest leather I have ever felt.

I actually wear this from time to time. It's a good jacket and it deserves some fresh air and dappled sunshine. Even if it's only for quick walks to the coffee shop, it deserves to be seen. Now, it can be seen here.

1hod3al,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibroids/comments/1hod3al/ufe_recovery_pretty_textbook_experience/,UFE recovery - pretty textbook experience,"I had the UFE outpatient procedure the day after Christmas. I had a 9cm intramural fibroid and two smaller ones around 2x3cm, also intramural, plus many other tiny ones. I asked how many ended up getting treated and the Dr said we will see when I get another MRI in 3 months. 

The procedure itself wasn’t hard or even painful besides a few stings from needles. They went in through the wrist and I was extremely drowsy, feeling nothing but just hearing voices. I was at the facility a total of 3 hours, most of it in prep and recovery. They gave me oxycontin and some other pain killers for the procedure and immediately after I had only mild cramping, around a 3 level pain. They seemed concerned about the incision on the wrist and I was advised to be careful with it. Nothing went wrong there either though - everything seemed very textbook and normal. Was advised to wait 24 hrs to shower. Was given crackers and apple juice before leaving. 

Day 0 - My wonderful fiance drove me home and got me coffee on the way. I slept a lot at home at first and ate a little of his homemade chicken soup around noon. About an hour later, nausea hit me and the rest of the day I couldn’t eat without vomiting, no matter what anti nausea meds I took. I had no appetite anyway. I drank tons of water and that stayed down. The cramping became horrible, at least a pain of 8, not the worst of my life but close. I was prescribed norco and took it every 4 hours as directed but there was no letup. I had been instructed by the nurse to take one last oxy before bed in order to sleep. It didn’t help at first and I wondered if I could take norco too… so my fiance called the on-call doctor around 9pm and he said keep taking the norco and take it every 2 hours as needed. Throughout the night, every 2 hours I took it and finally the pain subsided enough to sleep a bit. 

Day 1 - Felt immensely better so long as I kept up the norco. However I felt very loopy from it. I also took an antibiotic and started the anti-inflammatory Naproxen (aka prescription aleve). Still crampy and sore, but back down to a pain level 3.  Was able to eat a few bites of plain oatmeal with apple and then later a whole bowl of soup. Nausea was mostly gone but I took anti nausea meds before eating and standing for a shower. Standing or walking a lot still felt unsteady. Started feeling very bloated in the evening and took gasx before bed. Started spacing norco out again - every 3 hours and didn’t get up in the night to take it, but slept through 6+ hours. 

Day 2 - Taking less norco, I woke up feeling way less loopy today but still had minor abdominal cramps and now pressure.  I took a senna laxative since I didn’t have a bowel movement for 2 days. 

Besides the first day, it’s not that bad. I think I should’ve called the Dr earlier on day 0 when the cramping became horrible despite taking norco every 4 hours, but I kept thinking it would build up and take effect eventually. 

**I will not know for 3 months how successful the procedure was, but as noted, everything seems textbook and I anticipate good shrinkage**. Ironically, my fibroid symptoms are similar to the recovery symptoms — persistent abdominal pain, frequent bloating, feeling of constipation and sometimes actual constipation — but also pain during sexual intercourse and a constant pinching lower back pain.  The most immediate relief is back pain, which is entirely gone, but also I am on pain meds, sooo…. Happily, I have easy periods already.

I will return to post any updates. I have found this sub very useful for what to expect, so hopefully I can contribute to that myself.",2,1735413875.0,Fibroids,1,1.0,False
1hod2uv,https://i.redd.it/ajj2ilbc4n9e1.jpeg,"53 years old, 5’11, 80 kgs","Lots of young guns here, so thought I’d post a pic of myself to represent gen X. 

I’ve been working out my whole life, basically since I was 15. I ran track for my school in Madras and also for my university - UT Austin. Back then my focus was on speed and endurance, so my gym sessions focussed more on lean muscle and plyometrics. 

After I stopped running, I struggled to gain muscle. I blamed it on my Indian genetics. I could never go over 65 kgs, but eventually I reached 70 kgs at age 50. 

But a year ago when I was 52, I used a calorie counter to see how much I was eating and I was appalled. I was barely eating enough to cover my basal metabolic rate. 

I immediately raised my caloric intake from about 1800 calories a day to about 3200 calories a day. I started working out LESS but with more intention. I’ll explain that later. 

These days I box 1 day a week and train with weights 3 days a week. My split is 

Day 1: chest, shoulders
Day 2: back, biceps, triceps 
Day 3: legs and core 

I do about 3 exercises for each muscle group, and 3 or 4 sets of 10 for each exercise. The focus here is to really make a mind muscle connection and feel the muscle work, rather than just lift weights. I also focus on a full range of motion, and slow eccentrics. (This is what I meant by intention)

For my diet :

Breakfast: a pinch of turmeric with a glass of water as soon as I wake up. This has helped me with inflammation and joint pains. 

1/2 a bowl of oatmeal with blueberries and whole milk

30 gms of unsweetened whey protein with 200ml of cacao milk. I add a 1/2 teaspoon of Creatine here. 

Lunch: 6 eggs with some kind of chilli sauce. Maybe a slice or two of bread and butter. 

Dinner( at 7 pm): some kind of soup, a fish or chicken, some rice. 

Post dinner ( 9 pm) another whey protein/cacao milk/creatine shake like I had for breakfast. 

I avoid sugar except for a daily black coffee, which I drink with 3 level teaspoons of brown sugar. 

I try for 8 hours of sleep a night, but usually end up with 7 if I’m lucky. 

This routine has really packed on the muscle for me. I put on 10 kilos this year - I’m at 80 kgs now. I might try to get to 82 and then stop there. 

I hope this motivates more Indians especially of my age to workout and get serious about fitness. 

This sub is very heartening - so many young Indians are getting serious about health and fitness and that’s a wonderful thing. God bless ❤️🇮🇳🙏",90,1735413842.0,Fitness_India,13,0.99,False

1hod0ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/AddictionAdvice/comments/1hod0ki/in_need_of_advice/,In need of advice,"
Hi everyone,

I (F31) just ended a 9 year relationship with my boyfriend (M37) - an addict in recovery. He has been sober for 11 months, but his emotional immaturity really made it hard for me to keep coping. He gets angry for really small things since his sobriety (for example : being extremely angry when making a joke with a mutual friend that he always wants to leave very early when we need to go somewhere).

I believe it has to do with his low self esteem that is coming to the surface. He acknowledges this too, but still he feels that I don't understand him. The last time he was very upset when he made coffee for everyone on a trip with friends, and the last day of the trip a friend asked if we bought the coffee ourselves or if he got it from the cupboards in the appartment. He told her he found the coffee in the cupboards, which she replied to that they never take anything from the cupboards (appartment rented from a family friend). He took this very personal and was so upset and angry about it. It took an hour or longer for him to feel okay-ish again and act normal.

Afterwards my friend told me she and her BF felt like they had to walk on eggshells the whole time and she never knew this side of him. She found it 'admirable' how I could deal with this behaviour on a regular basis.

I tried to talk to him about it because I felt his reaction was unfair and disproportional towards our friends, but he felt as if I was worried more about our friends feelings than his feelings. He though I should just support him no matter what.

Eventually I gathered all my courage and asked him to start relationship therapy, but again he felt very attacked (""I worked so hard on myself this year, you want perfection,...""). Afterwards he calmed down and told me he was okay with starting therapy. But something in me already snapped. I just felt so tired and left our house the next day. Initially to find some peace for myself, but I just did not want to go back home to him. So after two weeks at my dad's house I broke up with him.

It's been a couple of weeks now and he really hopes that I change my mind and give our relationship another shot. He says he wants to grow old with me. He believes we can work on it together, but I feel like I can't fix his low self esteem issues and it is affecting my happiness and my mental wellbeing (I feel small in the relationship and I constantly adjust myself so I don't make it harder for him being in sobriety).

I don't know if I am making a big mistake by ending things now that he is sober and trying to work on himself.

I do feel like I have codependency tendencies. I am realising that I fall for men who are struggling with addiction and  I adjust to this 'saviour' role. I'm scared we can never get out of this pattern after 9 years and that I can only develop a healthy relationship when I have done some serious soul searching.

What do you think?

This was my unexpected winner, I loooooove the coffee in this. It’s sweet in a rich way, like fresh brewed coffee with a few bites of milk chocolate rather than a mocha Frappuccino. The whipped cream isn’t prominent, i think it just adds some light-fluffy creaminess to cut away from the richness of the mocha. 

This is perfect for a morning shower, I feel like Im cosplaying as someone who brews really yummy coffee every morning. I’m tempted to try this in the oil format.  

Thai Iced Tea (linen spray):

I’m kind of revolted by this one : ( It smells like there’s a start to a really nice Thai ice tea scent but something about it is very soapy. It isn’t pleasant soap either, it reminds me of the soap they use at hospitals or at the piercing shop. And it’s soooooo strong oh my god, I accidentally got some on my hair and a whole day later I woke up in the middle of the night and briefly wondered why it smelled like I was trying to lick tea off a hospital floor. 

Indian Donuts (silky soft body oil):

Ok, I’m going to admit I smelled this with very high expectations. I crave scents that accurately represent elements of my culture SO BAD and gulab jamun is godly to me, so I wasn’t going to settle. 

On first impression I was like hmmm, but the more I smell it the more I like it. It’s definitely not 100% gulab jamun, I almost feel like it’s missing out on that “fried” smell. Which is odd to want from a perfume, but the rest of it I really like. The rose water and the spices are dead on, while also being pretty dynamic. Everything has seeped together gorgeously. My only qualm is that the scent doesn’t last long, so I’m definitely going to either buy a perfume of this. Im 50/50 on if I should go for oil or edp. 

(Also I’d love any suggestions for gourmand scents from other cultures : ) !!)    ",2,1735413614.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

So we all know the story, right? Some goat herder named Kaldi notices his goats going absolutely nuts after eating some berries, and boom—coffee is born. Cute story, fun visuals, but honestly, total BS. Or at least, not the whole truth.  

The real origin of coffee? Way cooler and a lot messier. It actually starts with the Oromo people in Ethiopia, who figured out how to use coffee long before Kaldi and his goats got all the credit. From there, coffee made its way to Yemen, then the Ottoman Empire, and eventually Europe. But that journey wasn’t all fun and goats. it involved trade, culture, and yeah, some exploitation too.  

What really bugs me is how the Kaldi story became THE story. Like, why do we love oversimplified, sanitized versions of history so much? It feels like the real roots of coffee, especially its Islamic and African origins, just got erased in favor of something more “palatable.”  

So I’m curious, why do you think this happens? Why do we cling to these cute little myths instead of telling the full story? And is there a way to enjoy the fun legends while still honoring the real history?  

I made a video digging into all this, including the wild stuff you don’t hear about in the Kaldi story (hint: it involves monks panicking and Europeans calling coffee Satan’s brew). It’s up on YouTube now, and I’d love for you to check it out and let me know what you think.  https://youtu.be/n3v9LH_6NKY?si=pfdVZX9x2lqdm9kN

1hocp3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hocp3f/the_man_in_the_letling_room/,The Man In The Letling Room,"I first heard of the Letling Room nine years ago. I was a detective then, investigating the death of a brilliant physicist. Or should I say, former physicist. She had once studied dark energy at one of the top universities in the country. Yet one day, she had abruptly quit with zero notice and never published again. In the chaos of her apartment, there was, haphazardly placed amidst piles of papers with crossed out equations and diagrams I couldn't even pretend to understand, a hastily scribbled note,: *The Man In The Letling Room is the ONLY answer*. I had flipped through her diary, curious if it had any clues as to who this mysterious man might be.

In her diary, she wrote of a place called the Letling Room. She described it in precise methodical detail:

*It is not large, about seven by five meters, dusty, dimly let yet there is no lamp, candle or any light source whatsoever to be seen, and no window or any means to let light in from outside. In fact there is no door or any disruption in the smooth walls to indicate an entrance or exit. On the dusty wooden floorboards are piles of books and ornaments with strange writing on them, but the closer one looks, the blurrier they become, so it is impossible to say for certain what is in the books or what the ornaments depict. It is absolutely silent. There is but one piece of furniture in the room, a dusty, high-backed armchair facing away from me. I can't see who sits there, but it is axiomatically obvious to me that someone does, and he is the answer to every question I've tried to answer and failed: The Man In the Letling Room.*

She had, according to her diary, never been to the Letling Room, and seen it only once in a dream, right before she quit her job, and then never again. But I sat down to read through the diary, and sure enough, she wrote about the Letling Room constantly, in increasingly long and unhinged entries, trying desperately to derive an answer to various physics problems, a chaotic sea of matrices and numbers and Greek letters. But every single time, it would all come back to the same answer, repeatedly circled and underlined, sometimes with such vigor that it tore the page: *The Man In The Letling Room.* The final entry was comparatively short and to the point, a few days before her body was found: *11/04/2015. I give up. I've spent my entire life trying to understand why the universe is the way it is. It's the only thing I've ever had. The only thing that makes me happy. And the only answer that can ever make any sense is the man in the fucking Letling Room. FUCK HIM and fuck all the therapists who just repeat 'He's not real' like a broken record. Forget it. I'm done wasting my life.*

That physicist's death was officially ruled a suicide, brought on by paranoid schizophrenia. It was, I suppose, a fairly open-and-shut case. There was a note, an empty bottle of pills, no signs of foul play. Life moved on, and the Letling Room drifted to the back of my mind as newer cases piled up, especially after I got married, moved across the country, and went private--less mindless bureaucracy, more interesting cases that way. Not to brag, but I even managed to crack a couple of high-profile cases  that had been cold for years. And I suppose I forgot about The Man In The Letling Room. For a while, in any case.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Three years later, I was at a bar, three beers in and chatting with some random guy, an older gentleman named Ross who was an archaeologist from the local university. He'd had a few more than I had and seemed all too happy to ramble on about his students and his work--he'd apparently spent over twenty years studying some Bronze Age tribe in the Caucasus and trying to figure out why they'd suddenly disappeared, 3200 years ago. ""But that's all in the past,"" he told me, ""Today was my last day! I'm retiring and heading up north to my cousin's farm.""

""Okay, congratulations. But why now? Weren't you just on the cusp of figuring out what happened to the Karganians?"" I said.

""On the cusp?"" said Ross, ""Nah man, I've figured it out completely. Hell, I've figured out why everything that's happened in human history has happened. You could even say I've solved History itself. No need to keep working on it. I got into this field to understand it all, and now I do.""

Something seemed off  about that, especially the passion and conviction he said it with. Could just be a drunk guy rambling in a bar, but you don't get far as a PI by shrugging off clues as just drunk ramblings. ""So tell me. Why has all this shit gone down the way it has?"" I said.

He grinned broadly and clapped me on the shoulder. ""Why, The Man In The Letling Room, of course,"" he said with a hearty chuckle.

*Bam*. It hit me in an instant, like a bucket of ice water to the face. I remembered the details of that one case from three years ago and three thousand miles away. Dead physicist. Suicide. The haunting, eerie description of the place she called the Letling Room. I narrowed me eyes. ""And who the *hell*,"" I said slowly, ""is The Man In The Letling Room?""

""He's the answer to everything I've been trying to figure out,"" said Ross. He downed the rest of his beer, belched, and continued, ""See, a couple weeks ago, I was smoking a blunt and started hallucinating, which is weird 'cause weed doesn't normally do that to me, y'know? But I saw this creepy little room where I couldn't tell where the light was coming from, it was silent as a grave, and there were these books and figurines all over the floor, but any time I tried to look at one, it was just blurry gibberish. And the only furniture was--""

""An armchair?"" I ventured. I became vaguely aware that my heart  was racing and I was clenching my beer way too hard.

""Huh. You're damn right"" he said, ""Anyway, so it was facing away from me so I couldn't see who was in it, but I just had this *feeling* that The Man In The Letling Room was sitting in that chair, I *knew* he was there, and *he* was the answer to all of it. Not just the Karganians, but everything that's happened that that we don't know why. He didn't say anything, I didn't see him, but that's okay. I've found out everything I've always wanted to know!""

He paused, ordered another drink, then turned to me, seeing the look on my face. ""Say, how'd you know about the armchair? Have you seen the Letling Room too?""

""I...well...I knew someone who did,"" my drunk brain managed to stutter out, ""She told me about it once.""

""Oh!"" he chuckled, ""Well, good for her!""

""She's dead,"" I said quietly.

Ross's face fell. ""Well, I'm truly sorry to hear that,"" he said. He pushed his stool back and stood up. ""Anyhow, I'd best be going, I'm leaving early tomorrow. Have a good evening.""

""Wait!"" I said, ""You're just walking away from, what, forty years as an archaeologist because you hallucinated some weirdo in a chair? Giving up on your life's work?""

""I told you,"" he said, ""I've just *finished* my life's work."" And with that, he was gone.

I couldn't sleep that night. After a few hours of tossing and turning, I gave up and sat in my study thinking until the sun rose and my wife Sara brought coffee. Two seemingly random people, across the country, who saw the same eerie vision, described it the same, and spoke of The Man In The Letling Room. One quit her job, fell into a deep depression, and killed herself. One quit his job, seemed to be in bright spirits, and wasn't dead, at least not yet.

There had to be a connection. There always was. I pulled every stop, called in every favor I had, spent weeks trying to find any connection between these two people, putting all my other cases on the back burner. But there was nothing. No sign either had ever posted about the Letling Room online. No sign they'd ever exchanged private correspondence, or even knew each other. Two people had genuinely seen the Letling Room, completely independently of each other, then uprooted their lives because of the mysterious Man In The Letling Room, whom neither of them saw, but insisted was real.

If there were two, perhaps there would be others. I turned all my energy to scouring the country, and even the world, for more people who saw the Letling Room. My work suffered greatly for this, and in a few short  months, I was fired from my firm. Sara, sweet and supportive to a fault, hugged me, gave me a gentle kiss, and assured me that we'd get through this together, even took a second job to make ends meet.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

With her taking care of us, I continued my work. My true work, my real calling, finding The Man In The Letling Room. And I made real progress. I did track down a number of other people who'd seen the Letling Room. My notes and diagrams and photos filled every wall of my study, and slowly I began to piece together patterns. I was pretty good at that, you see, it's a big part of why I ended up as a PI.

No one ever says they've actually *been* to the Letling Room, or even know where it is. They just see it in dreams in visions, or simply, inexplicably know about it without ever having been told by anyone, and are always alone, except for that mysterious presence in the chair that they cannot see. They always describe the exact same thing and always know it as the Letling Room, even if they have never heard of it before and never seen or heard that name. It doesn't even matter what language they speak, it's always  the Letling Room. Believe me, I should know: I even interviewed--entirely through Google Translate--a despondent former mathematician in Uzbekistan who had burned his life's work, dismissing it as ""trivial and flawed, broken proofs"" and turned to herding goats in the mountains, and even he called it the Letling Room and referred to that presence as The Man In The Letling Room, and said he was the true answer to all his conjectures, and he no longer felt the need to study mathematics. Described that damn room exactly the same as everyone else, too.

But not just anyone knows of the Letling Room. Those who have seen it are those who obsessively study the deepest mysteries and the hardest questions known to humanity, in many different fields, almost always truly brilliant luminaries,  who have devoted their lives to knowledge and made sacrifices and difficult choices to be where they are. Those who have embraced their obsession and become one with it. That is their typical profile.

Yet after they see the Letling Room, they inevitably cease their work and stop seeking to understand the universe. They quietly feel, in their hearts, that this, truly, is what the answers they seek all boil down to. Some, like Ross the archaeologist, give up the pursuit of knowledge in exaltation because they believe that all their questions have been answered, and that answer is The Man In The Letling Room. Some give up out of despair, feeling that they will never find an answer other than simply The Man In The Letling Room. And some give up out of sheer weariness or fear or many other reasons, but invariably, those who see the Letling Room in their mind's eye have made their final contribution to the tapestry of human knowledge. Many people do kill themselves as a result, perhaps a quarter of those who have seen it. But not everyone dies or is even directly harmed by their experience. It depends a lot on their personality. But one thing is constant: when they see the Letling Room and feel the presence of The Man In The Letling Room, they forever abandon the pursuit of knowledge that once drove every fiber of their being.

In spite of these successes, I never drew any closer to my ultimate goal, to find out where is the Letling Room and who is The Man In The Letling Room. And I must admit, I was far from the best husband during those years. While Sara worked long hours, waitressing by day and working in a warehouse at night, I was holed up in my office all day and well into the night, searching for clues, or else hitting the road to investigate witnesses of the Letling Room and their families and friends. And when she was home, I was always either wrapped up in this great mystery, or sound asleep in my office chair, or scarfing down a meal before racing back to my office.

And she too started to grow cold and distant in turn. I think on some level, I must have seen the signs.  She stopped massaging my shoulders, stopped bringing coffee in the mornings, stopped calling me ""my love"". Somewhere along the line, there was a last time we slept together, a last kiss, a last meal we shared together. If I hadn't noticed any of those, perhaps I could've noticed her crying herself to sleep alone in our bed, or the open tab on her phone with a Google search for divorce lawyers. Perhaps I could've realized that she was--understandably--coming to resent me, suffering through long hours of backbreaking labor while I obsessed over some strange mystery instead of working as most people understand it. That with my long hours locked in the study until late into the night, and my constant random trips to interview witnesses, she would start to think there was another woman, or perhaps even several. But I brushed it all off, for solving this mystery, finding The Man In The Letling Room and putting a stop to whatever he was doing to people was more important than work, more important than love.

It all came to a head one night three years ago, around 2 AM. I was expecting a call from a lead, the daughter of a German neurologist who had woken up one night raving about the hard problem of consciousness and ""Der Mann Im Letling-Zimmer""; he was now missing, presumed dead. But I had dozed off and I suppose Sara had heard the buzz of my phone and pounced on it, and seen the WhatsApp photo of my lead--a blonde, busty twenty-something. Sara had grimly marched into my study, barely holding back tears, and shaken me awake, thrusting the phone in my face without a word.

I blearily glanced at her face, stroking my beard--it had grown unkempt and scraggly in the three years since I was fired--and tried to devise the most optimal response. ""I know how it looks, but don't worry,"" I said at last, ""She's just a lead. I think she might know someone who has more info on The Man In The Letling Room.""

Sara reacted faster than I could've expected, dropping my phone with a clatter and slapping me in the face. It hurt more than it logically should have, and not just physically. In that moment, it felt more like she'd slapped my soul. ""Man In The Letling Room, my ass! More like the woman in your hotel room!"" she snapped.

I sighed heavily, took a sip of lukewarm coffee, and glanced at a case report: some Harvard philosopher who'd abruptly walked away from his job to start a new life in South America. ""Sara, I promise I'd never. You know me,"" I said softly.

""No, I don't, Jason. Not anymore,"" she retorted. She sank to the floor, her back to the wall, no longer able to hold the tears in. ""You know, it was my birthday today, and you didn't even say anything. After *everything* I've done for you, the three *years* I've stood by your side while you did fuck-all and didn't even give a shit about me, let me work myself to the bone, weren't even there when my grandma died, and THIS is how you fucking repay me?!""

""I'm...I'm so sorry,"" I said at last, ""And, uh, happy birthday.""

""You have to go. Get out,"" Sara said shakily.

She locked herself in the bedroom the next day while I packed my things, didn't respond when I said goodbye through the door. I spent the night in some seedy motel, staring at the ceiling tiles and fantasizing about crashing through the wall of the Letling Room, tipping over that stupid chair, and beating the shit out of The Man In The Letling Room, whoever or whatever he was.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It was clear there was only one path forward now, and  that was to continue my calling with redoubled energy. So that's exactly what I did, wandering from place to place to investigate whatever leads came up and working odd jobs for spare cash. Sometimes couchsurfing, sometimes sleeping out of my car, sometimes stopping by a random library to add info to my ever-growing Google drive filled with profiles of those who have seen the Letling Room.

There must have been hundreds of witnesses by that point, at the very least. I was starting to find more and more of them. I don't know if that's because I was getting better and better at finding them--to be fair I was, but I still had my fair share of false positives--or if more people are actually starting to encounter The Man In The Letling Room. But I have noticed that knowing about him tends to increase the probability that one will eventually, well, not visit, for I increasingly don't think it's a place you can find on a map, but somehow have a mental picture and memory of the Letling Room, and feel the mysterious presence in that chair. At least for those with the risk factors, the thirst to answer hard questions and the drive to sacrifice it all for the answers.

Some of the living witnesses have speculated about the nature of The Man In The Letling Room. Some say he's God. Some say he goes far beyond that. Some say he wants to hurt humanity, some say he wants to help, some say he simply doesn't care. Some swear that if they could somehow see just go to that room for real and look at that armchair...that it would be *empty*. But for most, he's simply The Man In The Letling Room.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

About a year ago, I was at a rest stop on some godforsaken stretch of highway somewhere in the Midwest, with nothing but the highway, thinly populated with trucks, slicing ruler-straight across endless flat fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. The bitter cold sliced right through my thrift-store coat, too thin to provide any real protection, and flurries drifted in the air. I had just interviewed a fellow disgraced PI, now slowly drinking himself to death in a trailer in the middle of nowhere, who'd insisted that The Man In The Letling Room was responsible for every case he'd ever failed to crack, and was on my way to investigate a dead quantum physicist in Boulder, apparently a suicide, and speak with his family.

It was getting towards sunset, and I'd been driving across past these never-ending fields all day, so I figured I would pull over and take a nap before continuing. And as I ate my ham-and-cheese sandwich and sipped my coffee, staring morosely into the distant fields, I suddenly remembered something. Sitting there, in that rest stop, out of nowhere, *I remembered seeing the Letling Room*.

I don't know when or how, but the memory was just as vivid as if it had been yesterday, and I remembered seeing it *myself*, not just imagining it from other peoples' descriptions of it. It was like all the hundreds of people had described it: a small room dimly lit from an unknown source, with piles of books and ornaments on the floor, and that mysterious armchair, facing away from me because of course it fucking was. I somehow remembered picking up one of those books, only for the contents to melt away to an illegible blur as soon as I focused on them. I remembered realizing with absolute certainty that The Man In The Letling Room, whoever or whatever he was, sat in that armchair. I remembered hurling the book at the back of the chair in a fit of rage, and that The Man In The Letling Room did not react in any way whatsoever, nor was the absolute silence broken as the book hit the chair and fell to the floor. I remembered wanting to step forward and see what was in the chair.

And that was all that I remembered of my experience with the Letling Room, regardless of whenever and wherever it may have been, or if it even truly happened. But it was enough. In that moment in the rest stop, I was absolutely, unshakably certain that this was as good as it was ever going to get, that this was the closest I would ever come to an answer, no matter how much I tried, no matter how hard I thought, no matter how much evidence I gathered. This was it. The Man In The Letling Room is the explanation for all that is inexplicable and the answer to all that is unanswerable. That's all. A pity I wasted all these years and ruined my life, only to arrive at that conclusion.

That night, I burned all of my case files in an empty field. There was no more need for them. That revelation in that random rest stop was the end of the line, the furthest I or anyone else  was ever going to get towards solving the mystery, I knew that  with absolute confidence from the moment I felt the presence of The Man In The Letling Room. The next morning, I stopped in the first town I came across and settled down there.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It's been a year since that fateful day. I'm doing alright now, I suppose. I mostly keep to myself now, eking out  a living flipping burgers in this random town. Sometimes I think about my old line of work, or about trying to track down Sara to apologize and explain myself. But what's the point? I and countless others have tried and failed to search for answers and explanations to the deepest mysteries time and again. It's not worth it. The only thing you'll ever find is The Man In The Letling Room.",3,1735412792.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

 Good Morning, Soulmate!
	Another late night? I do hope you’re getting enough sleep. Is the sleep you are getting at least good? I’m beginning to find pros to being up and down all night. I had 2 more dreams with us last night! These ones were wild adventures man! Oh, and I finally got to start true Vault Hunter mode last night. So I’m one step closer to getting you that pink skin. Won’t be too long now!

	So dream #1. We’re both high schoolers but this time at a Japanese high school. I’m a part of a club and I don’t think you were a part of any. Did I mention we have powers? I didn’t find out yours till the end but mine were healing, super speed, flight, and rebirth which was disguised as future vision. The story begins in the school’s cafeteria which looks like a whole ass restaurant. I had been reborn into this exact moment to try to stop the impending destruction of the world. Every rebirth I get a new power so this must’ve been rebirth #3. This time though you had somehow found out about the coming destruction and were already trying to stop it however neither of us had any idea that the other was doing the same thing. This mid-section is kind of a blur for me at some point during it we end up teaming up and becoming friends. On our way to the final area where the world ending begins, we ended up not making it in time because we stopped to try and save someone. This is when I found out about your powers. You have flight and also the ability to manifest and manipulate universal superhuman healthy/healing blood within someone’s bloodstream. The blood would be black in color and would disappear from the person once you were done healing them. Anyway as The world begins ending around us I fall to the ground using all my strength and power to manifest a rebirth portal large enough for the both of us to go through. When you saw me fall you dove down to my side and held my hand as if trying to give me your strength and power too. The portal appeared and before I woke up I saw the two of us go through hand in hand. 

	The next one is very fantasy. The setting is definitely very early Game of Thrones reminiscent. It begins with both of us in the slave trade. You and I were in different groups so we never really were near each other to interact. After watching countless people die or be murdered I summoned all my courage and prayed to whatever entity was listening to give me the power to free the people. The Norse goddess of magic, Freya answered. You and I were the only people who could see her despite our separate groups. I used my newfound magic to free my group, then yours, and then the whole camp. Although you did point a bow at me during our first meeting as you have mad bow skills in this dream. After the camp’s liberation, they appointed me the leader of this revolution and you the second in command. My first decision was we were going to all travel and find a place to colonize. When we were almost to this new place a massive army appeared from behind us intent on eradicating us. Freya decides the only way we both survive is if she inhabits my body till the day I die. With a goddess now within me I enchant your bow and we defeat the army’s heads causing the army to join our revolution. The final party is silly as fuck. We get to the new land which has a massive river going through the center of it. The colonization begins and we decide to name this colony America. The first building built is the HQ and our home. We’re roommates. Do you know what the building looked like? It was a mini white house built beside the river. Laughing my fucking ass off right now. My dreams are wild, right?

	Here’s your Pinterest quote of the day: “Do not let anyone come and go into your life as they please. You are so much more than someone’s second option, an afterthought when things change. You deserve to be the first person they think of, no matter the moment or who is in front of them. If you are truly important to someone, you will always be their first choice. Just as they are yours.”

	For my like and dislike of the day. I really like Sweet Tart Ropes. I think it was back when I was in middle school that they were first introduced as Kazoozles. My grandpa and I were obsessed and we’d buy a crap ton every time we saw them. For my dislike; I’m not a huge fan of coffee. I like coffee ice cream, the scent of coffee, and espresso in baked goods but other than that I don’t like the taste of it.

	I hope the rest of your day is wonderful. I’m here for you always and I hope you find something that makes you smile today. I miss you, Sunshine. Always and Forever! 🩷

	P.S. My stepdad found these breakfast pizza rolls and they’re really fucking good. Also thinking I might start a new Spotify Playlist. Our original one was meant for our Steven Universe characters so I’d like to have one where we add OUR favorite songs or songs we think we’d both like.

1hockpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestIndia/comments/1hockpl/looking_back_at_2024_a_year_in_retrospect/,Looking Back at 2024: A Year in Retrospect,"I was thinking about all my actions in 2024 and I realized I've been a bigger as\*\*\*le than before. Last year, I had a pretty bad divorce. I was mindfucked and everything kinda messed me.  In the end I moved continents for my mental health & some career growth. I grew up in India, moved abroad and moved back to Bangalore, India after 12yrs.

Beginning of 2024, like every stupid single guy I made a M4F personals post and someone replied. She was a talker just like me. Within hours, we moved to another app. Talked for hours almost everyday for over a week and at some point we decided to meet. We had a good time, we discussed so much in terms of life, our views, our past experiences and our expectations from possible partners etc. We kinda vibed to another level. I've a bad habit of making sexual jokes and comments pretty often. Not about the person, but just in general. I didn't hide it or pretend to be someone I'm not. After all, I'm a divorcee and I know my flaws and I wasn't trying to cover it up. I was talking about all this from day 1 and everything seemed to be fine. After the meeting, the situation kinda flipped. She started to become a little clingy and some of her actions reminded me of my ex. I kinda freaked out and ghosted her. Looking back at it now, I feel so stupid. That was such a cowardly act on my side for not explaining myself. I'm a little to embarrassed about myself to text her and explain myself and apologize for my actions.  
  
 A few months later, same thing happened again. M4F personals post --> texting --> Vibing to another level and deciding to meet. This time, it was a little too adventurous and it happened so fast. Like after a day of chatting & talking, we decided to meet. It was blind date, we didn't know how either of us looked but our views matched and we could talk without thinking twice. It was easy and comfortable. I was stupid, I had mentioned I was single in the post. Technically I'm not wrong, but the girl was looking for someone who was never married. She didn't ask and I didn't tell. Without discussing this we went on a date and it was fun. Lots of beer and fun conversations. Luckily, we ended up on the topic of divorce and I mentioned my status and clearly explained  myself. Eventually, she said it was not gonna work out between us, since being a divorcee was a dealbreaker for her. Again, the as\*\*\*le in me popped out of nowhere, telling me if she dumped you, you better ghost her and don't confront her. And yes, I did the same.

A couple of days later, I met a woman from my office. She's also a divorcee like me and we kinda hit it off. This time, we met at a party hosted by one of our colleagues. We spoke a lot and we were able to relate to each other. Gradually friendship turned into dating and then the surprise, she had applied for a role in my team and I had no clue about this. She was interviewed by some of my teammates and she cleared the interview. I was on vacation for a couple of days while this happened. She had no clue, that I was gonna be promoted as a manager and she'd be reporting to me in the next couple of weeks. As soon as I got to know this, I confronted her and she wanted to keep our dating news a secret from the rest of the team. A friend of mine knew about us dating and made fun of it in front of my manager. He rescinded her offer and that started the same sequence of actions. We fought and neither of us could explain ourselves to each other and finally ended up mutually blocking each other.   
  
After all this, I decided I was done with dating and I replied to a F4M post on reddit. It was for a platonic friendship and we both were in different cities anyway. We started chatting and after a couple of days it was becoming more than platonic. Like I mentioned, my bad habit of making sexual jokes was turning into flirting and she was also responding back. We were kinda into each other and I was traveling from Bangalore to Mumbai for work. We met for a coffee and she invited me to her place. As soon as I entered her house, I see a picture from her wedding. Surprise -- She was a married woman. I confronted her and she agreed she was married. I panicked and left without a second thought. I ghosted her and blocked here everywhere. I know we all have reasons to do things, but this was a dealbreaker for me. I regret not giving her a chance to explain herself but  I had just gotten out of a messy divorce and I didn't want to add more drama to life.

I went on another date from reddit. It was pretty quick, like after a night of texting we decided to meet. It was fun but her expectations and mine were not aligned. She wanted to be friends but I didn't want to look/sound desperate and be friends with her and ended up blocking her.   
  
All along, I didn't look back and think about my actions. Today, I feel I've been a bigger as\*\*\*le than ever. I've had some painful experiences in the past but that doesn't justify my actions. I could've been more reasonable and acted like an adult.  I want to apologize to every one of them,  but I'm so embarrassed to take accountability for my actions.  I only hope to fix this behavior in the days to come and be more mindful and responsible adult. 

Thanks for your time and Happy New Year guys. ",1,1735412483.0,OffMyChestIndia,0,1.0,False

Chapter 1: Time Police



Jacob Swing awoke to chaos. The remnants of a half-eaten bag of chips crinkled under his shifting weight, while a sticky puddle of spilled soda spread across the once-white rug, turning it a grimy black. Beside him, the nightstand lay overturned, its two wooden legs splintered and broken, a casualty of some unknown nighttime calamity. The soft morning light poured in through the open window, highlighting the wreckage. Outside, the distant cacophony of chirping birds clashed with the impatient honks of traffic below, a symphony of life he felt wholly detached from.

Groggily, Jacob groped under his body and fished out his phone. Squinting at the screen, he checked the time: 6:50 AM. Relief washed over him—he had an hour before work. Enough time to linger in the comforting embrace of his memory foam mattress. It clung to him like a lifeline, urging him to stay cocooned in warmth and forget the world outside.

But the universe had other plans. Right on cue, his alarm blared, jolting him from his brief reverie. The familiar opening theme of his favorite video game filled the room, a melody that usually brought joy but now grated against his fatigue. Groaning, he slapped at his phone to silence it, muttering under his breath. Even cherished tunes were unbearable when faced with the cruel demands of the morning.

With a resigned sigh, Jacob sat up, peeling the blanket away. His eyes landed on the broken nightstand and the mess littering his floor. Rubbing his temples, he tried to piece together the events of the previous night. Bits of memory surfaced: a bar outing with friends, laughter turned to shouting, the metallic taste of cheap beer. The pile of empty bottles near his bed confirmed the rest. He’d been drunk, again.

Navigating his room was the first challenge of the day. It was a battlefield of discarded food containers, paper plates, and empty soda cans. Each step was a calculated maneuver to avoid the shards of broken glass or other hazards hidden beneath the chaos. For a fleeting moment, the idea of cutting his foot and skipping work seemed appealing. But today was non-negotiable; he had conferences to attend.

He shuffled out of his room, the floor creaking under his weight. The bathroom was just a few paces away, one of the few perks of his cramped apartment. Standing before the mirror, he took in his reflection. It was not a pretty sight. His once-bright green eyes were dulled by exhaustion, framed by dark circles that hinted at sleepless nights. His shoulder-length hair hung limp, begging for a trim. He stared at himself with a mixture of disdain and pity.

“This is my life,” he muttered, turning on the faucet to splash cold water on his face.

Jacob was in his mid-twenties, a tall, wiry figure with more regrets than accomplishments. He had no girlfriend, no diploma, and a dead-end job teaching math to teenagers who barely cared. Yet, beneath the cynicism, there was a flicker of hope. His laptop, perched on a makeshift desk in the living room, held the draft of a fantasy novel he’d been painstakingly crafting. It was his one escape, his ticket to something better.

After a quick shower and a haphazard attempt at grooming, Jacob dressed in his usual work attire: a suit jacket and tie over blue jeans. He looked marginally better but felt the same hollow ache inside. As he poured himself a cup of coffee, he turned on the news, letting the monotonous drone fill the silence. He didn’t care much for current events but watched out of habit, convincing himself it was the responsible thing to do.

Settling into his beanbag chair, he sipped his coffee and opened his laptop. The words of his novel greeted him like old friends, offering a brief reprieve from reality. He scrolled through a few pages, tweaking sentences and jotting down ideas. This was his passion, the thing that kept him going. But time was not on his side. A glance at the clock showed it was already 7:20. With a sigh, he closed the laptop, downed the rest of his coffee, and grabbed his keys.

The drive to work was unusually calm. No music today, just the hum of the engine and the swirl of his thoughts. He mulled over his story’s characters, their struggles, and triumphs, wishing he could trade places with them. The blaring honk of a car behind him snapped him back to reality. The light had turned green, and he hadn’t moved. There was enough bad drivers in Jacksonville, Florida already. He didn’t need to add onto that. Muttering an apology to no one in particular, he pressed the gas pedal and continued on.

Morning sunlight sliced through the windshield, casting fleeting patterns across the dashboard as Jacob navigated the usual traffic. The low hum of the engine was the only companion to his thoughts until the Bluetooth system buzzed to life. A name flashed across the screen: *Mom*.

He tapped the button to answer, just as he signaled to turn left into the faculty parking lot.

“Hello? Jacob?” Her voice crackled through the car’s cheap speakers, warm yet distorted by static.

“Ma.” Jacob’s tone softened as he glanced around, searching for an open parking spot.

“Jacob, are you driving?” Concern laced her words, even though she already knew the answer.

He smiled despite himself. “Yeah, heading to work.”

There was a pause, a sharp inhale that betrayed her hesitation. “Well, I can call later if you’re busy—”

“No, it’s fine,” Jacob interrupted, finding a spot near the faculty section. He turned off the engine and leaned back in his seat. “I just parked. No need to worry.”

Faint yelling and muffled voices echoed from her end of the line—his brothers, undoubtedly stirring chaos even at this early hour.

“Alright then,” she said after a moment. “I just wanted to let you know your father’s planning to stop by later today. What time do you finish work?”

Jacob’s hand froze mid-reach for the door handle. His father? That name carried weight—questions and memories he wasn’t ready to unpack.

“I’m done at four,” he replied cautiously. “But… Dad? Why? I thought he was still working that case in Chicago.”

“He was. But he called last night, saying he needed to talk to you in person. Didn’t say why, and I didn’t push. You know how he is.”

Jacob frowned, his mind racing. His father’s cryptic nature had always been both frustrating and fascinating, but this sudden visit felt... off.

“Why didn’t he just call me himself?” he asked, his voice tight.

She chuckled softly. “That man and his secrets. It’s why I married him, you know. Always keeping me guessing.”

Jacob swallowed, his throat dry. “Alright, Ma. I gotta head in. Love you.”

“Love you too, sweetie. Have a good day.”

Ending the call, Jacob stepped out of the car. He adjusted his tie as a cool breeze swept through the lot, carrying with it the faint scent of morning dew. The school loomed ahead, a familiar structure that suddenly felt heavy with an unknown weight.

 

He sat at his desk, writing up a few emails as the clock struck 8:05. Teaching math was the easy part of his job; the hard part was the kids that followed. At 8:10, students would flow through his classroom, and he’d have to teach. Today felt weirder than usual—his mind still caught up in his own writing, as well as the matter of what his dad could be doing showing up at his place later.

 

His dad worked as a detective and had been all the way in Chicago a few weeks ago. Something about a new breakthrough in some case he was working on. Every time Jacob prodded the man, he’d shoo him away. What felt like minutes passed as he wrote up emails, all while thinking about what was going to happen. What plot point to add next for one of his main characters, if he should go to the store after work or not, the case his father had been working on for the last few years.

 

All this time passed. Yet… 8:05. He raised a brow as he got sudden goosebumps. No time had passed. He wearily looked at his computer time, then at the clock. For a minute, he waited… No time ticked up. 8:05.

“How are they both broken?” he muttered to himself, standing up to go check the clock on the wall. He pulled out a chair, planning to stand on it and check it himself. That’s when it happened.

He felt someone standing next to him. A puff of hot air blew across his face as his hair swept right. He barely had time to see the man, but got a good look. Wearing what looked like metallic armor—no, it was like the armor was integrated into the man’s skin, as if he glowed silver. He wore a gas mask and goggles, as if he was ready to snowboard down a hill. His physique was round as well. And what is that he’s holding—

A shotgun.

Bang.

His entire being fell apart. Time seemed to move slower for some reason, as he felt his eyes push deeper into his skull until his brain exploded with a crimson pop.

Darkness.

Thoughts… Thinking. He thought. He saw darkness. What just happened? Did he die? A million thoughts went through his mind as he saw nothing but a black screen. If he was dead, how could he think? Thoughts blurred together in an uncomfortable mesh of noise.

Then light. Too much light; it surrounded his entire being, as if he was being born for the first time. So much light that it physically hurt him to look at it. He put an arm over his eyes until the light slowly seeped away. Within moments, he put his arm down and saw blue sky. Clouds. He was sitting on the top of his school building. Surrounded by fat, dead bodies, scattered about the building in piles. He didn’t blink for a good second, taking it all in. He only blinked when he realized he got his head shaved off by a shotgun. After he realized that, it felt surreal—he had eyes. He immediately felt at his head, touching it as his entire body went through a sense of relief.

“God’s— you are going to get me so in trouble,” a voice sounded in front of him. Sitting up and looking, he saw a short woman, with blood streaked across her face, and her large, oversized tan cloak she wore over her body. She had gold pupils, with long peach-colored hair. She looked straight out of a fantasy story.

Pacing back and forth, she bit at her fingernails, only now noticing him when he was gawking at her. He didn’t realize how much of a fool he probably looked—his mouth wide open, hair all messed up. Before he could speak, his mouth absurdly shut, as his head began to ache. An excruciating pain emerged out of his brain, causing him to hold his head with both hands and grunt.

“What are you— Oh, right. Head got blown off.” She clicked her teeth, waving it off as if it was nothing. The pain, after about a minute, was eventually subdued. He knelt on the ground, sweat dripping from his forehead. He remembered it all now. The fat man with the creepy mask, shotgun pointed right at him. Buckshot to the face—he couldn’t avoid it. Nobody could—his entire head was blown clean off.

He looked up at the girl, who was now sitting cross-legged on the railing of the roof. She sighed. “You done, bud? I got things to say.” He gawked again. He wanted to speak, but the words didn’t come out. He grabbed his suit tie, yanking it out and pounding on his chest. With the fourth pound, the words flew out of him like a bullet train.

“AM I DEAD?” he yelled out. He didn’t even mean for it to be a yell, nor was that what he wanted to say. But that’s what he was thinking; after such a rough encounter, that’s all he could think about in the first place. The cloaked girl sighed again, as if annoyed. As if she was the one who just got their head blown off.

“Uhm…” She put a finger to her lips, eyes looking up at the sky as she began to think. “Yes… And no.” He raised a brow, staring at her with frustration and now confusion. “What do you mean? I can’t be dead and alive at the same time, can I?” He said that with a condescending tone, one she didn’t seem to pick up on.

“Actually, you can. Let me explain.” She cleared her throat. “You died in your time. Your body is lying in that classroom right now, bits and pieces of your brain probably reaching all the way back to your desk. But I managed to snag your body and consciousness and transport it to another timeline, one where this school isn’t even open yet.”

He stared. The words seemed to process slowly to him, every single syllable hard to digest. His lips quivered as he knelt there, staring at her. She stared back.

“What are we doing? Staring contest? I’m down,” she said, sitting up, opening her eyes more as he started a staring contest. He blinked a second after. Just as she was about to make another witty remark, he barked up a response.

“So… I died?”

“Yep. But you’re alive here, so… no!”

He sunk deeper. He thought about his life, the countless attempts at suicide in the past. This was what he wanted, right? This was what he always wanted. But then he thought of his mom, and of his dad, and of the people that genuinely cared for him. What would they hear? That their son’s head randomly exploded in the middle of a classroom?

“Listen, I know this might be rough for you, but we kinda gotta hurry. Any more questions before I move on?”

He stared at her again, nodding in agreement. His mind wandered from the past to the present. And to multiple other questions he still had that were bugging him, making his head ache even more for answers.

“Well, uh… I guess who shot me? And why and— who are you?”

She rolled her eyes, uncrossing her legs and standing up. The girl looked early twenties and was admittedly easy on the eyes. Her peach-colored hair blew as a gust of wind blew west.

“Well, that’s simple. I’m God.”

His eyes widened.

“I’m just kiddin’,” she grinned, mustering out a little laugh as she adjusted her cloak. “Actually believed me, didn’t ya? Guess nothing is off the table after what happened.” He sighed, this time rolling his eyes. “Get on with the answers.”

“Jeez, fine.” She stretched, sitting back down on the ledge. While keeping eye contact, she pointed to the dead fat men that lay on the roof next to them with her thumb.

“Where do I even start…” She took a deep breath, as if she was about to give him a heavy lore dump. “Okay. Mostly every timeline is controlled by an unknown, all-seeing god. That god controls every event, controls every person, and weaves life through its image. Basically, free will doesn’t exist.” She stopped to give herself a breather, then went on.

“Those fat dudes? Called Time Police. Whenever someone goes off script, they show up and take care of ya. You went off script somehow, and they took your head for it.” He nodded, kind of understanding it but also not having a clue what she just said. Judging by the look on her face, she recognized his confusion.

“So… nobody has free will, I went off script, and died…? Then now what? And who are you?”

“Name’s Kalaf. I’m a paladin. Basically, I jump around timelines fighting against Time Police and saving people from them. Or—more like salvaging them.”

Jacob couldn’t help but put a hand to his face and laugh. This all seemed so ridiculous. One minute he was living a normal life, the next he’s caught up in this. His brain asked him many questions, ones he didn’t want to dwell on for long or else he’d never leave this roof. His writer brain nagged at him as well—this was straight out of a game story or some kind of fiction.

“So now what? You leave me here in this other timeline?"" She shook her head, standing up once more. “Won’t be long before more Time Police show up. I got to take you back home.”

“And home is?”

“Mega city. Or, better known as universe 0. The only universe with free will.”

Jacob stood; legs weak as he almost collapsed. But then again, he’d rather get shot in the head again rather than fall flat on his face in front of a girl.

“You probably got more questions, and I’ll answer them all soon, but we seriously gotta go.”

He nodded, wanting to question more and more until he understood everything. Now he just felt tired though, ready to be done with all this. It all felt like a weird fever dream. “One more thing- what do I do once I get there? You can’t just leave me someplace I’ve never been.”

She walked over, touching his chest. “I’ll introduce you to my squad of elites. The jumpers.”

Before he could pry any further, she grabbed his wrist and strapped it on a large, mechanical clock- one that had four hands, all of them being small. Instead of the usual time it had small little lines, with one long black line being at the center. She twisted the knob on the side until it hit the long line, then pushed a button on the same side.

Reality deconstructed. He felt himself fading- his matter decomposing into absolute nothingness. As if he was a PowerPoint presentation, and he was simply transitioning into a new slide, everything came alight again. He stood in the same exact position, with Kalaf’s hand still on his chest. This time she opened her eyes, stepped away and took a long breath.

“We made it.”

He looked to his left, and what he saw was truly spectacular. Sprawling skyscrapers, flying vehicles, neon roads and holograms filling the sky. The neon lights and other worldly effect left him grasping at the concept of it all. He then looked towards a sign close up, which read off four words.

F 25 located in CST (12:45 PM) interested in swinging back into my writing life. The big bad depression bug bit, but I’m trying to climb out. I’m frequently described as quirky, sensitive, kind, thoughtful, playful, and a bit of a hippie.  Writing recently has been kind of hard, but I’m slowly finding my motivation again! I’m craving an AMAZING story to get the juices flowing again.

I’m most interested in finding someone that I can chat with ‘out of character’ just as easily as I can send a roleplay reply to. One of the more important deciding factors of my partners for me is how I click with them on a personal level. I like to be friendly, chat about nonsense and have fun with each other. 

Please be 23+, within 6 hours of CST, at least decent grammar and spelling capabilities (I get everybody makes mistakes), romance is pretty important to me within the roles.  slow burn is preferred! 


Ideas: 
A mischievous (enter fantasy race) woman is adventuring in a nearby forest and has some kind of accident.  She is injured and unable to get herself back out of the woods. A (healer, wizard, mercenary, etc.) finds her shortly after and carries her back to their cabin. They help with her injuries and spend a bit of time together before realizing that feelings have sparked.  Will they go back to their old lives? Intertwine them? or start something entirely new. 
Desired tropes: stuck together, grumpy/sunshine, unique pairing

*Somehow* a woman encounters a dragon shifter (traveling merchant, runaway princess, dragon rider, etc.). Fairly quickly they bond with each other and then go on to have many adventures with each other ransacking local towns, saving the kingdom, or simply traveling in the world we’ve created. 
Desired tropes: fated mates 

A woman is an artist in a district near the castle.  After several interactions with the high lord, an affection forms between the two of them.  Despite their difference in status, they continue a secret relationship until it is eventually found out and decisions have to be made. 
Desired tropes: status imbalance, unique pairing

ACOTAR and The Vampire Diaries are universes I’m always happy to create around. 

Open to your suggestions! I’m always down for pretty much anything fantasy related!

1hocdje,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1hocdje/stuck_and_unmotivated/,Stuck and unmotivated ,"You read it..... I am stuck and unmotivated. In March, I signed a lease to open my shop. I was on top of the world, after 2 years of planning with a S.C.O.R.E. mentor, I received a grant for my main machine, I had all my equipment, my suppliers, my location, and had an open date for 4/1/24. Our open date was planned to coincide with a large semi annual even across the street from our shop. Everything was finally coming together. One moment I was flying high, and the next, the ground was gone. 

  
Literally everything seemed to fall apart, all at once— 

Our location included 2 buildings. Building A was the main shop with seating. Building B was going to be used as an office/storage - future use will be for take out/drive thru. 

Less than a month after I signed the lease (paying deposit + 3 months rent), I wanted to give myself a a couple month cushion. We got huge amount of rain, and both buildings flooded. The flooding went on until end of May early June. Now we are 2 months past our open date. We live in a small rural area, local businesses rely of annual events for good revenue. Then next event was going to be July 4th. 

June 19th - My nephew (2M), that had been with our family for the last 18 months (long story), was picked up and taken by his biological mom, despite her absence, lack of communication, and against advice of our local sheriff's office. Legally I was stuck - my brother has no intention on being a father or making sure my nephew is safe. When this happened, I remember trying to file guardianship papers, the court clerk wouldn't file them for me, talked social services, begged her to do it gradually so he can get to know her. I don't really remember much of anything between then and mid- September. It hurts me to say that now because my fiancé and our 3 kids (12F,14F,15M) feel the pain and loss just as much as I do. (As an update, bio mom keeps saying we can plan visits, etc, but always finds a way to not show up.)  It's been 192 days.  - Ok back to business. 

July 4th - had no business even trying but we did anyway, we were going to open come hell or high water.....  instead it was ended up being electricity giving us the shock. building A wasn't fully ready so we utilized building Bs large open front area - until not a single electrical outlet worked in that room (there was around 10). Determined to salvage this disaster we move all our coffee pots, warmer, supplies into the empty future ""office area"" very small about 6 outlets but they at least worked! Until they didn't. Between breakers, confusion, and mayor AND BUILDING OWNER trying to talk to me in the midst of this mess I'm pretty sure I checked out and told everyone to shut everything off and go home. 

August - I reach out to the building owner because I know I haven't paid July or August rent yet. At first he seemed fine, and willing to work with me, than he started becoming very persistent about me paying him, I was getting multiple texts daily asking for the money (knowing I still hadn't opened, and with all the BS with the buildings). September I told him I did not want to continue with the lease, he made me feel very uncomfortable, not only emotionally but physically (he would literally look into the shop windows while i was working) instead of coming inside the unlocked front door of his building. It gave me the creeps. Also our county has zero building or health codes ( I know, WTF). 

Now it's almost 2025, my machine I got with the grant, was taken back (because) opening was one of the stipulations), so when they found out I wasn't going to open, they came and took the machine. All my other equipment, supplies, furnishings, inventory are stored in my garage at home.  

I've spent the last 6 months just trying to keep going, trying to manage, the business blocks, muddle through the grief, help hold our family somewhat together though all this, that I lost myself and my goals. Which is ironic bc I usually have about 3 plans, for each decade, for the next 5 decades constantly running through my head. Some days I feel like we are finally getting our groove back and will be able to move forward, than some days, I still spontaneously cry for hours because I pickup up one of my nephews toys or outfits. 

I have no clue what I am even trying to get out of writing this.  I am so grateful for having great kids, the best sister, a safe home. 

I can handle my shit. Always have. I will find a way through it.  Nobody tells you how lonely grief is, or just can't explain it.  ",1,1735411951.0,startups,1,1.0,False

Tea Burn has completely transformed my life in ways I never imagined. A few months ago, I was stuck in a rut, feeling sluggish, battling with my weight, and losing confidence with every glance in the mirror. No matter how hard I tried to stick to a strict diet or push through another grueling workout, the results just weren’t showing. I needed something to kickstart my journey—something to give me that edge—and that’s when I found Tea Burn.

At first, I was skeptical. We’ve all seen products promising miracle results, right? But something about Tea Burn stood out. Maybe it was the simplicity—a tasteless powder you can add to your tea? No fuss, no drama. It seemed too good to be true. But the reviews were glowing, and people were raving about how Tea Burn had helped them finally shed those stubborn pounds. I decided to give it a shot.

The first week of using Tea Burn was eye-opening. I started mixing it with my morning tea, as suggested, and immediately noticed a difference. My energy levels shot through the roof. I didn’t feel jittery or over-caffeinated; instead, it was this steady, consistent energy that carried me through the day. Suddenly, I wasn’t dragging myself to work or needing that mid-afternoon nap. Tea Burn became the fuel I didn’t know I was missing.

And then, the real magic started. Within two weeks, I noticed my clothes fitting better. My face started to look slimmer, and the stubborn fat around my belly—my biggest problem area—began to shrink. I wasn’t just losing weight; I was gaining confidence. For the first time in years, I felt like I was in control of my body.

What amazed me most about Tea Burn was how easy it was to incorporate into my life. I didn’t have to overhaul my routine or follow some complicated regimen. One simple packet a day, mixed with my tea, and I was good to go. I even started looking forward to my tea time—it became a small but significant ritual that set the tone for the rest of my day.

The ingredients in Tea Burn are the real deal. The green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and L-carnitine worked together like a dream team, boosting my metabolism and helping me burn fat without feeling like I was depriving myself. The L-theanine kept me calm and focused, while the chromium helped curb those pesky sugar cravings that used to derail my progress. Everything about Tea Burn just made sense, and it delivered on every promise.

Fast forward three months, and the changes are undeniable. I’ve lost 25 pounds, but the numbers on the scale aren’t the only victory here. Tea Burn gave me my life back. I feel lighter, more energetic, and genuinely happier. My workouts have improved because I finally have the stamina to push myself. My diet is better because I’m not constantly fighting cravings. And most importantly, I’m proud of the person I see in the mirror.

People around me started noticing, too. Friends, family, even coworkers began asking what my secret was. I tell them it’s Tea Burn—and it truly is. Sure, I still make healthy choices and stay active, but Tea Burn gave me the kickstart I needed to make those habits stick. It’s like having a secret weapon in your corner, working with you every step of the way.

If you’re reading this and wondering if Tea Burn is for you, let me say this: don’t hesitate. I know how hard it is to feel stuck, to want change but not know where to start. Tea Burn is more than just a supplement; it’s a game-changer. It’s helped me break through barriers I thought were insurmountable, and I’m confident it can do the same for you.

This isn’t just another product—it’s a true success story. Tea Burn has become a part of my daily routine, a catalyst for change, and a reminder that sometimes, the simplest solutions are the most powerful. If you’re ready to take control of your health and start living the life you deserve, Tea Burn might just be the answer you’ve been searching for. It certainly was for me.

## Tea Burn Ingredients 

The magic behind Tea Burn lies in its ingredients. Each one plays a vital role in helping you lose weight and feel better than ever. When I first looked into the components, I was impressed by how thoughtfully they were chosen. These aren’t just random fillers—they’re scientifically backed ingredients that work together to support fat burning, boost energy, and improve overall health. Let me break down how they’ve helped me transform my body and my life.

First up is **green tea extract**, which is the cornerstone of Tea Burn’s formula. Green tea is well-known for its ability to boost metabolism, thanks to its rich supply of catechins and caffeine. These compounds work together to increase your body’s ability to burn fat, especially during exercise. I noticed that within days of starting Tea Burn, I felt more energetic and lighter, and I’m certain green tea extract played a big part in that. It felt like my body’s engine was running smoother, burning calories even when I wasn’t actively working out.

Then there’s **green coffee bean extract**, another powerhouse ingredient. This contains chlorogenic acid, which has been shown to reduce the absorption of carbohydrates in the digestive tract. In simpler terms, it helps your body process food more efficiently, so fewer calories turn into fat. For someone like me who used to struggle with stubborn weight around my midsection, this was a game-changer. Green coffee bean extract doesn’t just burn fat—it helps prevent it from forming in the first place.

**L-carnitine** is the ingredient that gives Tea Burn an extra edge. This amino acid is like a personal chauffeur for your body’s fat stores, transporting fatty acids to the mitochondria, where they’re burned for energy. The result? Not only does L-carnitine help you burn fat, but it also gives you a noticeable energy boost. I used to hit an energy wall by mid-afternoon, but with Tea Burn, I found I could power through my day with ease. It’s a small shift that makes a huge difference.

The inclusion of **L-theanine** was a pleasant surprise. It’s not just about losing weight—Tea Burn helps you feel good while you’re doing it. L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea leaves, promotes relaxation without making you feel drowsy. When combined with caffeine, it provides a smooth, balanced energy that keeps you alert and focused. This meant no more energy crashes or jittery feelings, which was a massive win for me.

Finally, there’s **chromium**, the unsung hero of Tea Burn. This essential mineral is often overlooked, but it’s a game-changer when it comes to curbing cravings. Chromium helps regulate blood sugar levels, which in turn reduces those uncontrollable sugar and carb cravings that can derail your progress. For someone who used to give in to afternoon sweets almost daily, this was life-changing. Tea Burn didn’t just help me lose weight—it helped me gain control over my eating habits.

What I love most about Tea Burn is how these ingredients work in harmony. It’s not just about losing weight—it’s about creating a healthy, sustainable lifestyle. I didn’t feel like I was forcing my body into overdrive; instead, it felt like Tea Burn was gently nudging it in the right direction, helping me achieve my goals without stress or struggle.

As the weeks went by, the results spoke for themselves. The weight I’d been trying to lose for years finally started to melt away. I felt more energetic, more focused, and more in control than ever before. And it wasn’t just physical changes—I felt a shift in my mindset, too. Tea Burn gave me the confidence to believe in myself and my ability to stick to a healthier routine.

The best part? Tea Burn’s ingredients are all-natural, which gave me peace of mind knowing I wasn’t putting anything harmful into my body. It’s a clean, effective formula that delivers on its promises. Whether you’re just starting your weight loss journey or looking to break through a plateau, Tea Burn is the perfect ally to have in your corner. It worked wonders for me, and I’m confident it can do the same for you.

I miss the woman with BPD who discarded me so much. We were friends, then lovers. I truly \*don't\* believe she ""didn't exist.""  I don't think she was a mask. But this fall, she had a horrible and understandable  trauma response to being raped by a guy she knew and trusted. Part of that trauma response was to discard me, and a few other people in her life (including one of her oldest friends and maybe even her mom, but I'm not sure). Even factoring in her trauma,  I can't fathom how the sadist who broke up with me could possibly have been the same person I loved. The cruelty was incredible, and of course, she inverted and twisted everything I said to make me the monster/villain in her version of the story. It's possible that the person who broke up with me was/is the trauma-inspired construct or mask. I'm not sure. But the trauma of her rape was devastating. I tried supporting her and comforting her. It didn't work. It all went to shit. She won't get therapy for it, because she's had terrible experiences with therapy.

I'm coping OK with the loss of my lover. It hurts. Oh, God... it hurts so deep. But I'm coping, through therapy. I happened to go into the place of business where we met and became friends. She quit working there about year and change ago because of... yes... an emotional blow-up with her boss. I passed the bulletin board and there were funny/cute things she'd posted there still up. Pics of her cats, jokes, sketches, etc. And I fucking imploded. Because I remembered the friend I loved so much before we became lovers. I remember laughing with her. Her warmth. Her kindness. It destroyed me. That was 10 days ago, and I feel like I have an opened wound in my chest. I miss my friend so much. I miss walking around with her. Getting tacos and beer. Going to movies. Making coffee. Hanging out at her place watching movies with her cats on our laps.  My therapist is away until well after the Holidays. This wound goes down to the bone. And I hate to know that she is still hurting, because of the rape. I can't help my friend. And I miss my friend. And I want to be there for her. But it can't be.",2,1735411625.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

However I have always loved IT for my own home and had the chance to setup a friend/clients security cameras, network (wired and wifi), vpn and company laptops . It was a lot of fun doing it and a nice change of pace compared to web development. I do have some concerns though as I am not certified in this field. 

So it got me curious how many individuals in this group that have been working for larger IT companies that have really given them a ton of real world knowledge have gone on their own?  Do you feel like you couldn’t have done a business if you hadn’t worked for these previous employers? What certs do you feel apply most to a business that sets up IT infrastructure for small local businesses (coffee shops, trade businesses, etc). From the web side I have loved working with clients to build and maintain their sites so I would hope the same moral follows for line of work if I get into it but it’s hard to gauge how people treat IT companies given all the complaining on this Reddit channel lol.

Can a hobbyist who takes their homelab serious transition into this field pretty easily or is there just too much to learn without these certs everyone talks about out.

Also from web development I use azure quite a bit so I was going to build my business around that for a lot if stuff( azure ad, servers if needed, etc). Is that a bad approach or is on premise typically what small business need to save on costs? And is that more fun given you get to buy equipment which for home is slightly addictive

I could just be naive thinking I could just switch from web development to adding this as a branch of my business offerings. What’s everyone opinion on doing this given my background and your experiences.",0,1735411429.0,sysadmin,20,0.4,False

Potluck Cookery, 1955

Found this curiosity in a “vintage” shop. It appears to have never been opened or used. I bought it not for the recipes, but only because my family has a couple funny stories about our experiences with potato latkes & Welsh rarebit. This book contains recipes for both. I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually use any of the recipes in the book. But I thought I’d share these here nonetheless.

——

POTATO LATKES

Nothing in the house but:
Potatoes, 8 large, peeled and grated. 
Egg, 1 or 2 separated and Flour, 1 tbsp.
Grated onion, 1 small (optional),
Butter or shortening, 3-5 Tbsp.
Applesauce or sour cream. 
Salt and pepper to taste. 

Mix grated, then well-drained potatoes with egg yolks, flour, onion, salt, and pepper.  Fold in stifly beaten egg whites. Heat butter or shortening in frying pan. Drop in potato mixture from a spoon. Flatten. Fry until golden brown on both sides. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve hot with either applesauce or sour cream, sugared or not as preferred. 

SERVES 4.

Suggested: Add bacon and coffee and you have a wonderful lunch or late supper menu. We say 8 large potatoes but even 10 would not be too many.

——

GOLDEN WELSH RAREBIT

Nothing in the house but
American cheeses, 1 cup grated, ¼ pound
Butter or margarine, 1 tbsp.
Milk, ½ cup, or ¼ cup plus ¼ cup white wine
Salt, 1 tsp.
Dry mustard, ½ tsp.
Paprika, ¼ tsp.
Worcestershire sauce, ½ tsp.
Slightly beaten eggs (optional), 1-2
Bread, 6 slices
Substitute: Any sharp cheese.

Beat butter, milk, salt, mustard, paprika, Worcestershire, and egg together until well mixed. Stir in grated cheese.
Butter bread slices. Cut in half to form triangles. Arrange around edge of shallow pie plate point side out. Place remaining slices on bottom of plate, butter side down.
Pour cheese mixture over all. Bake in moderately hot 400° oven 25 minutes. 
THIS CAN BE SUPPER MAIN COURSE FOR
2. OR AN APPETIZER OR SIDE DISE FOR 4.

Suggested: Wonderful with cold dry white wine.",9,1735411361.0,Old_Recipes,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone, please bear with me as I try to piece this together! I read this book about four or five years ago, so it was definitely published before 2020. The story starts with a human woman who somehow gets transported (possibly accidentally) into a fae realm. Once there, she’s bought (or claimed?) by a fae king who explains that he and his twin brother are in desperate need of a mate to stop them from fading away and dying.

The twin we meet first seems stronger and more dominant, while the other twin (who we meet later) is more sensitive and fading faster. They take her to a cottage where she gets to know both of them, and I definitely remember the story having some spicy moments!

One detail that really sticks out is that she interacts with goblins at some point, and they respect her as a strong queen—something to do with her drinking coffee, like they do? There’s also an evil witch (or some kind of antagonist) in the fae town who’s involved with the less sensitive twin.

At some point, the human woman returns to her own realm but realizes she doesn’t have a mate there. It becomes clear she’s meant to be with the twin fae kings in their realm. The central theme revolves around her being their destined mate and saving them from fading entirely.

Unfortunately, I can’t remember the names of the characters or the book title, but I’d love to track it down as I’m trying to compile a list of books I’ve read. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Thanks for any help!",0,1735411272.0,whatsthatbook,0,0.5,False
1hoc45q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hoc45q/creepy_fedora/,Creepy Fedora,"Do you ever get that weird feeling like you’re being watched? Like you are not alone? Like someone... or someTHING... is out there? Usually, it’s just that, a feeling. You look around and quickly see a familiar, friendly face waving at you. But what about that similar feeling, with shivers running down your spine, with a small voice in your head telling you that something is off. Telling you that, when you look around, you are not going to see a friendly face. 

...  

It was sometime between seven and eight in the evening and, since it was winter, it was already dark outside. I was at the gym in Ljubljana with two of my closest friends. Clever fit in Situla. That was probably my favourite gym. Since they opened another Clever fit gym in Bežigrad the one in Situla usually wasn’t too busy, the equipment was in good condition and there was plenty of space. On that day however, it was pretty crowded. After arriving and meeting out front, we entered through the main entrance, scanned our RFID bracelets and looked around.    
“A lot of people.” I said. “What do we hit first?”    
“A woman.” Tim answered my question with no hesitation.    
We looked at him with a slight smile and look in our eyes that said, there was something wrong with him.    
“A g\*psy?” Tim broke the five seconds long pause.   
“We need to find a girl with the biggest and sweatiest ass and just follow her.” We looked at Denis with confusion and laughed.   
Suddenly I got that creepy feeling I spoke about in the beginning. I felt like someone was watching me and that it wasn’t just a cute girl checking me out from across the room.    
“What’s wrong with you?” Denis asked after noticing I’d stopped following them towards the changing room and seeing the weird expression on my face.   
“Ehh nothing.”    
I chose to ignore it. I had gotten that weird feeling quite often recently. Ever since that night when I couldn’t sleep and decided to go for a walk. 

I woke up suddenly, all sweaty, from a weird dream that... I couldn’t really remember. All I could recall were some freakishly long, pale arms and fingers. The fingers were grotesquely pointy. There was also another thing I could not get out of my head for days. A fedora. It looked... normal. Nothing out of the ordinary. But there was this weird feeling that accompanied it. The more I thought about the hat, the more uneasy I felt. I tried to fall back asleep but couldn’t. So, I got dressed, put on some shoes and went for a walk before it was time to leave for work. It was around two am so I had about three hours until my alarm clock was supposed to ring. I didn’t get far before I got that same uncomfortable feeling. I stopped and looked around. Where I was standing, was the beginning of a very badly lit park. Because I could not make out anything out of the ordinary anywhere around me, I kept going. Just... on higher alert. There was no rational reason for me to worry, at least from what I could see or hear, but I also did not want to ignore my instincts, so I decided to take a turn towards the main street with more traffic. Well. As much traffic as you can get in the middle of the night. I returned to the apartment at around 0330 hour, had a normal breakfast for once, drank a cup of coffee, showered and drove to work. Even though I had gotten that feeling again, time to time, I didn’t think much of it. I sort of got used to it and wrote it off as a probable stress side effect. Until that evening. The evening, I went to the gym with Tim and Denis.  

We changed into our sportswear, locked our bags into lockers and stepped back out of the changing room. We took just a couple of steps looking around and trying to make a workout plan based on unoccupied equipment. That is when I felt it again. The feeling of being watched. The shivers. The goosebumps and the hair standing up on the back of my neck. This was the shortest amount of time between two separate incidents until now, not to mention this one was by far the more intense I have ever felt. It stopped me dead in my tracks. I looked around with a look that probably resembled that of a deer in front of a pair of headlights, if the deer was also pretty annoyed at this point.    
This time it did not take me long to find him. I just started staring, I could not look away. The awful feeling got even worse. And the man... the... thing... was staring right back at me. Even though I had never seen him before, I immediately recognised him by the long, thin arms and fingers... and the fedora. He was tall, wearing a dark grey woollen coat, his arms were as grotesquely long, like were his fingers, as in my dream. I couldn’t even see the end of his long, pale pointy fingers through the crowd from across the gym. Even though he was on the other side of the gym, it was like he was right in front of me, a meter (about three feet) away. I could clearly see the buttons on his coat, the long, slender, unnaturally pale neck leading up to... the face...   
The face had only one really noticeable feature. A long thin slit across, that I could only assume, was his mouth. It went from where one ear was supposed to be, to where the other one was also missing. I couldn’t even see the eyes from under the fedora, but I could feel his... or its... look. I was staring at the fedora, I got dizzy, the room started to spin slightly and everything else in my vision around the entity got blurry. Must've been seconds, but it felt like hours to me before I could finally get a sentence out of my mouth.   
“Are you guys seeing this?” I stuttered quietly without breaking eye contact.    
Tim slowly leaned towards me looking in the same direction.   
“Black people, am I right?”   
“What?”   
“What?”   
I looked at Tim with a confused look and as I turned back, the entity was gone. I noticed a large, muscular black man, roughly in the same direction. He was bench pressing the weight of a small car.   
“That one would’ve been pretty expensive back in the day.” Tim added.   
“You’re telling me you didn’t see the guy in the coat.”   
“Nope.”   
“What are you guys doing?” Asked Denis as he stepped closer to us.   
“Luka is watching dudes in coats.”    
“Gay.” Was Denis quick with his response.    
I let out a nervous laughter, as I still hadn’t completely shaken the dizziness, but genuinely found their comments funny, and told them to go fuck themselves. Denis then quickly informed me about the general lack of clothing of the female population and the appealing figures, as well as about his desired action, had he come into closer contact with one of the attractive females. I immediately wanted to erase that interaction from my memory.  

I was still shaken from the encounter with the materialization of my nightmare. I had a feeling this was not the last time that I had seen... or heard... of the creepy fedora. I had no idea, however, ... how right... I was.

I would like to upgrade my current setup, a saeco aroma nero + kingrinder.

To set you into situation, I live in France and my budget is relatively modest, but a rancilio silvia or something of the style could be accepted if I found a good deal second hand. But for the past weeks, I can only see rather aged machines for almost 400€. To which, I would quite soon have to add a grinder to ease the workflow sooner than later.

So the situation now is, I have a person willing to sell his ECM Classika + Eureka Mignon Specialità for 1000€, with a nice set of accesories. Its close to where I live and seems in good shape.

Here is where I'm having my doubts:

* I know I would spend almost that if I were to buy a similar grinder with another machine. I'm happy to add a PID to a rancilio, but I fear I would spend the same in the end.
* I don't particularly seek the E61, it seems cool, but 25 mins to heat up is a lot more than the 5 I wait now. Yes, a Home Assistant plug solves the morning situation, but not a sudden need of coffee.
* It's just so much money for coffee, I didn't get any christmas present and can afford it, but my income is not the US Standard.

Usage is:
50% espresso - Profitec Go
30% aeropress - grind into glass jars to take to work
20% pourover - slow days for relaxed Hario V60 switch.

Currently have an inherited Barratza/Mahlkonig Vario. There is a risk the original owner may require it back. Not a fan of the adjustment style on the Vario.
I single dose into the hopper always, change beans a lot. 

I am early days, finding my way in espresso, usually drink espresso, long blacks or very poorly poured flat whites.

Grinder recommendations welcome:
Seeking grinder capable of grinding for espresso and pourover:

(Probably) Electric
Flat Vs conical (not sure)
Under £750
Quiet if possible
One for each (?!)
If one - easy adjustment between the two

Ideas so far are:
Niche Zero
Eureka specialita
Barratza Sette
DF54
DF64
K-Ultra (maybe)


Potentially even getting an espresso grinder then a hand grinder for pour over...

Wondering whether I should have taken the blue pill and stuck with my humble french press and pre-ground...
Help me wade through the unending variable and delightful dismay in the rabbit hole of coffee.

I was one of the younger attendees there, everyone else was a bunch of middle aged adults. When it was my turn, I had to stand up to the front and use a big touch screen to answer the question. The question had something to do with ""Which nozzle setting is best for a medium cup of coffee on a Keurig machine?"" I remember trying to answer it to the best of my ability and answered something like ""The 8oz setting.""

After answering that, the screen showed that I was completely incorrect, and that the actual 'correct' answer was a random fact about medieval weapons that knights used, which was totally unrelated. The screen then showed a bunch of cgi animated medieval visuals. I felt really confused and came to the conclusion that the game was clearly rigged and meant to humiliate people. The dream took an even worse turn and all the middle aged adult attendees belittled and mocked me in a very patronizing way like I was really stupid. I felt very ashamed in the dream. I woke up right about there.

And yes I am on the spectrum, so I feel this dream mirrored my inner struggles and how I feel about myself sometimes. It also mirrored how unfortunately some people treat us on the spectrum in real life. What are your thoughts on this dream I had?

1hobt8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/1hobt8h/2024_perfume_collection_reflection/,2024 Perfume Collection Reflection!,"I thought it would be fun to reflect on how my collection has changed this year!  I made a similar post a year ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/FemFragLab/comments/18vfg05/reflecting\_on\_my\_perfume\_journey\_over\_the\_past\_12/) and it was interesting to look back on and see how my tastes have changed since then...

Link to my current full collection: [https://www.parfumo.com/Users/PurpleKat/Collection/I\_have](https://www.parfumo.com/Users/PurpleKat/Collection/I_have)

**Current Top 10**

This is so hard to do, but it's nice to see my top favourites from last year remain true!

**1. Dior Pure Poison**

**2. Initio Musk Therapy**

**3. YSL - Libre EDP**

**4. Byredo -Bal d'Afrique**

**5. YSL - Libre Le Parfum**

**6. BDK - Gris Chanel**

**7. Initio - Rehab**

**8. Nishane - Hundred Silent Ways X**

**9. JHAG - Not a Perfume**

**10. BDK - Pas Ce Soir**

\-

**Perfumes that have left my collection this year: 19** (4 used up / 15 sold)

I'm kinda shocked at this! I've listed them in the order they were gone.

**1. Lancome - La Nuit Tresor Nude** *(Decant / Used up)*

**2. Dior - J'Adore** *(Mini / Sold)*

**3. Escentric Molecules - Molecule 01 + Mandarin** *(Decant / Sold)*

**4. Kayali - Vanilla 28** *(Mini / Sold)*

**5. D&G - Dolce Garden** *(Full bottle / Sold)*

**6. Katy Perry - Indi** *(Full bottle / Used up)*

**7. Narciso Rodriguez - Pure Musc for Her** *(Mini / Sold)*

**8. Carolina Herrera - Good Girl Legere** *(Decant / Sold)*

**9 . Narciso Rodriguez - Cristal** *(Mini / Sold)*

**10. Kayali - Musk 12** *(Mini / Sold)*

**11. Armani - Acqua di Giola** *(Mini / Sold)*

**12. Mugler - Alien Goddess** *(Mini / Sold)*

**13. Ariana Grande - REM** *(Mini / Used up)*

**14. D&G - L'Imperatrice**  *(Full bottle / Sold)*

**15. Aerin - Hibiscus Palm** *(Mini / Sold)*

**16. Lalique - Amethyst** *(Decant / Sold)*

**17. Kayali - Wedding Silk Santal** *(Mini / Sold)*

**18. Kayali - Wedding Velvet Santal** *(Mini / Sold)*

**19. Replica - Coffee Break** *(Decant / Used up)*

None of these were / will be repurchases and anything I sold was because I fell out of love with them. Kayali perfumes were the major casualty of my tastes changing this year. I suddenly couldn't stand any of them, so I was glad I had only bought the minis!

**Newcomers to my collection this year: 13** (2 full bottles / 11 decants/minis)

Listed in the order I bought them.

**1. Kajal - Lamar** *(Decant / Won't repurchase)*

**2. The 7 Virtues - Coconut Sun** *(Full bottle / Would buy again)*

**3. EL - Bronze Goddess Nuit** *(Mini / Won't repurchase)*

**4. Initio - Paragon** *(Decant / Undecided)*

**5. BDK - Bouquet de Hongrie** *(Mini / Would buy again)*

**6. Chanel - Coco Mademoiselle EDT** (*Decant/ Undecided)*

**7. Mancera - Holidays** *(Mini / Undecided)*

**8. Maison Margiela - Mutiny** *(Mini / Would buy again)*

**9. Carolina Herrera - Amethyst Haze** *(Decant / Would buy again)*

**10. Byredo - Eleventh Hour** (*Decant/ Undecided)*

**11. Kilian - Angels' Share** (*Decant/ Won't repurchase)*

**12. Nishane - Hundred Silent Ways X** (*Decant/ Would buy again)*

**13. Alexandre.J - Oriental Enigma**  *(Full bottle / Undecided)*

In addition to the above, I also upgraded to full bottles from decants/minis of the following:

**1. Initio - Musk Therapy**

**2. Byredo - Bal d'Afrique**

**3. Byredo - Gypsy Water**

**4. Initio - Rehab**

**5. YSL - Libre Le Parfum**

I feel like I'm in a really good place with my collection now, and mostly love everything. My ultimate goal is to only own absolute loves by the end of 2025 though. With that in mind, these are the perfumes on the chopping block that I'll be looking to use up or sell ASAP:

**\* Narciso Rodriguez - For Her EDT** *(Mini / Not my style)*

**\* Byredo - Mojave Ghost** *(Decant / Fell out of love)*

**\* JPG - Scandal Le Parfum** *(Decant / Not my style)*

**\* Valentino - Donna Born in Roma** *(Decant / Fell out of love)*

**\* Zadig & Voltaire - This is Her!** *(Full bottle / Fell out of love)*

**\* Jimmy Choo - Fever** *(Mini / Bored of it)*

**\* Replica - Beach Walk** *(Full bottle / Bored of it)*

**\* Montblanc - Signature** *(Full bottle / Bored of it)*

My overall realisation is that I've been too hasty adding new perfumes to my collection this year and have decluttered a lot more than I had realised! I'll definitely be sticking to the sample > decant rule more in 2025 and will resist buying too many more full bottles (20 is my self-imposed max).

**Wishlist for 2025**

Full bottles, in order of priority:

**1. Dior - Pure Poison** *(Replacement as I've almost used my bottle up!)*

**2. Nishane - Hundred Silent Ways X** *(I've been through a few samples and decants of this and still absolutely adore it, so it'll likely be my birthday present to myself!)*

**3. Juliette Has a Gun - Not a Perfume** *(This is a staple, must-have easy-wear/layering scent for me, and I've been through 3 x travel sizes!)*

**4. Carolina Hererra - Amethyst Haze** *(She's pricy, and the performance isn't amazing, but I'm addicted to the scent, and the bottle! I'm in no rush to buy though and will only do so if I find a really good deal!)*

**Summary**

It's been an interesting year for me and I feel like I've been on a real journey of discovery with perfume! I've had a lot of fun but most importantly I finally understand after two years of intensive scent sniffing what I really like. In 2025 I plan to sample WAY less new perfumes, have longer trial periods of samples/decants before committing to bigger volumes and enjoy wearing what I already own much more.

I hope at least some people have found this interesting to read. If anyone has any questions about any perfumes listed I'd be happy to answer them the best I can!

I'd love to hear how others' collections have changed this year and any goals/wishlists for 2025!",6,1735410444.0,FemFragLab,0,0.88,False

It’s 8am on a Sunday, and you just left Club Space in Miami. You’re still wearing the same mini dress with glitter smeared on your eyelids. You smell like sweat mixed with the perfume you applied to heavily the night before and the various fragrances of the people that were crammed around you all night.
The sun is shining. People are on their way to church. Families are walking to their favorite brunch spot. The air smells like sun, a stark contrast to yourself. Hungry from the night spent dancing only fueled by illicit substances, you and your friends decide to go to little havana for a coffee and food. You’re immediately engulfed with the intoxicating scent of the cafecito and pastelitos, bringing you wholesome memories of your abuelita preparing cafe cubano and pestelitos de guayaba in the early morning to fuel your abuelito as he sits on the porch and enjoys a cigar all day. Memories so wholesome in contrast to your not so wholesome night.

Perhaps a bit over the top, but isn’t perfume supposed to tell a story?

Why not get instant coffee or some creamers??? Seriously what a dumb idea to pair a huge bottle of vodka with a fucking coffee mug. It pisses me off because now we have this bottle in the house that I personally feel should have never came with the gift anyway.

1hobnir,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hobnir/how_people_have_time_to_do_it_all_long_post/,How people have time to do it all (Long post),"Time is tricky. It’s both valuable and slippery, and many people struggle with carving out time for what they care about.

You’re also not going to feel good about yourself If you know or see someone who seems to do it all.

I want to show you how those people do it, and how the answers are much more underwhelming and accessible than you might think.

(The person you know/admire may do some or all of these things, but these are the patterns I have noticed)

**They spend less time on more things:**

It doesn’t take much to cross the beginner stage and impress people. If you spend 20 to 30 minutes on something three times a week and keep at it for a couple of years, people will think you’re decent at it.

This means you can spend one hour on three things, three times a week, and be seen as decent in all of them by most people.

Meanwhile, someone else spends one hour on one thing and only earns one trophy. The diminishing returns of expertise don’t help much either.

The illusion comes from this: because you’re not an expert in the hobbies of the person you admire, you assume they are more competent than they are and therefore you make the conclusion that they must have had more time.

In reality, they spend less time on more things.

(In some cases, they are competent as you deem them to be, but they also spent 5 years' worth of effort on it spread out over 10.)

**They had years of practice:**

This is really important to understand. Being able to maintain a habit, hobby, or side project that takes 10 to 30 minutes a day in its maintenance phase probably took years of messy, unproductive trial and error.

Any project demands an order of magnitude more time and resources at the start than in its maintenance phase.

Sure, it only takes them a short amount of time now, but it didn’t before, now they have efficient systems in place.

If you have 5 to 10 years and you want to be good at 3 to 5 things, you can start with one thing and reach its maintenance stage in a year or two. Then you add the second thing, and so on.

Before you know it, you’ll be a “master of time management.” where you can do all these things without breaking a sweat, and someone looking from the outside won’t understand how you perform that way.

**They delegate/automate:**

If you can spend one to two hours automating something you’ll never have to think about again, like bill payments or subscriptions, why not set it up?

You can get groceries delivered and drastically reduce your trips to the store. Keep a list of the items you care about and get those yourself, but let someone else handle the rest.

Also, get a roomba!

If you think this is too much, you’re right, it is. But people have sacrificed even more. They hire nannies, virtual assistants, and services of all kinds. What I suggested is just the tip of the iceberg.

If someone seems to be “doing it all,” maybe they’re doing one or two things they care about and is visible to the masses while delegating or automating the invisible, less impactful tasks. It’s more common than you think.

**They had minimal starting conditions**

Let’s say you want to write, draw, learn a language, or lose weight. Chances are you’ve set conditions that you think are “reasonable” for starting.

For many productive people, the starting conditions are much simpler (and sometimes dirtier). Most of our conditions are luxuries in disguise.

You may want a quiet place to write; they started writing on their phone while on the subway. You may need decent materials to draw; they used a regular notebook during lunch breaks.

At first, these setups are sneaky, messy, and barely functional. You’ll question if they’re even worth it.

But that’s only the case in the beginning. Over time, the process becomes more convenient, but that convenience only comes after starting under unfavorable conditions.

**They cared more than the pain**

This isn’t a motivational post. It’s about the basics of how the human mind makes a decision. Caring isn’t enough, you need to care more than the cost of the action.

Are you okay with spending money you don’t have to automate something you think is a luxury, just to carve out enough time to do something small and “pathetic”?

For some, the answer is yes. You need to care enough to tolerate the cost. Not everyone has that clarity or drive, but it’s important to view the person you admire within the context of their life, not yours.

This is not to paint their motivation in a good light, sometimes it’s healthy, other times it’s not, because they may dread or deeply dislike the situation so much that the pain of change pales in comparison.

If you were running for your life because a bear was chasing you, you wouldn’t care much about how tiresome running is, right?

**They follow a structure, sometimes blindly:**

I don’t want to talk too much about this but the general idea is this: the person knows exactly what to do and when to do it. For example, piano practice for 30 minutes at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That’s it.

The focus isn’t necessarily on how well they perform during the practice, it’s about going through the motions. Simply having a clearly defined routine cuts out so much of the guesswork and friction that can derail action. The simpler the structure, the better.

Motivation and discipline will always fluctuate, but the brain thrives on routines and cues. A solid routine provides stability and consistency, even when your willpower is low.

Think about how much of a hassle walking would be if you had to consciously plan every movement. Sometimes, blindly following a set routine works in your favor.

**They're not that good at managing their time:**

This might seem weird, but many people who seem to do it all, don’t really do it all, sometimes they’re procrastinating in a different way than you do.

A common example that you may relate to is procrastinating on the work you need to do by doing work that is more appealing.

The same principle applies here, Maybe they’re neglecting crucial areas for others, maybe that's their way of coping with their emotions.

Everyone procrastinates, maybe not in the same way and to the same extent that you do it, but everyone does it in some way.

**Energy matters more than you think**

You can cut down a lot of effort just by eating right, sleeping right, and exercising right. Ask the person you admire what their energy levels are like.

Low energy is insidious. You might take twice the time to finish a task, only to realize it didn’t need to be done at all. Your priorities can become a mess, your patience gets halved, and your ability to learn, think, or articulate becomes impaired, you also need twice the amount of time to rest and catch up. A cup of coffee won’t fix all that.

Time management is rarely just about time. Energy always plays a role. You don’t have to take my word for it, just think about how much you got done on a day you felt rested. How pleasant was the experience? How “locked in” were you?

Your best day is some people’s default state.

That's it, that’s the underwhelming trick.

A good day where you sleep well, eat well, delegate the things you hate, and focus on the things you enjoy suddenly feels incredibly productive and you end the day motivated for the next.

Now that we've got that out of the way, let me tell you a bit about the three prompts I have in mind!

<The Wolf, the Lion, and the Sheep>
A princess elect finds herself earning the throne after a dangerous yet brave act of self sacrifice to save her beloved student. When the king of Alderon passes and leaves the former peasant to lead his country she is tossed into the bitter world of politics, war, and manipulation. She's aided by the general of her army (OC #1) as she navigates the pressing issue of their rival attempting to conquer her lands. The king of (kingdom) (OC #2) extends an offer: marry him or declare war between their countries. The Queen is stuck between her growing feelings for her general and her duty to her people, drawn to the mysteriousness of the King despite his threats. What does her reign have in store for her and can she navigate the betrayal from those around her? 

I am looking for someone to play OC 1 & 2, these characters are entirely up to you. Should the general have pure intentions with the young ruler, or does he have an nefarious reason for charming her into caring for him? Is the king truly evil, or does he wear the facade of a merciless ruler in order to instill fear and obedience in his people? You decide.

<Betrayal>
When her parents disappear in a tragic attack, Princess Deowin is crowned queen. With an oncoming war between her country and the next, she is torn between finding out what happened to her parents and negotiating terms to end the rivalry. Your character is the commander of her rival's army, sent to protect the Royal Advisor and intimidate the young queen into accepting a deal no matter the risk and reward. Yet, something inexplicable pulls the two together. A shared bond, one neither can explain yet fight tooth and nail to avoid. In this world, only those with gifts ruler over the lands, but will they find that the general has these gifts too? Will they give into their desires and risk the collapse of any possibility of peace? What web of secrets will be unwraveled to shed light on the truth behind the King and Queen's death?

I am looking for someone to play the commander as well as the royal advisor, though romance is not planned for the latter. Though I have plans for the Queen and her family, I give you full reign to develop your own country as you see fit. 

<Sleeping Beast>
In a world where dragons used to roam the earth, only tales of their existence remained. The long standing army named the Vipers remain the protectors of the realm from the fire breathing beasts. When a soldier comes face to face with one of these beasts, he barely escapes with his life and the predator's head. His bravery spreads from coast to coast until his infamy earns him an offer her cannot refuse: the hand of high lord's daughter and a title of his own. Should he reject the generous offer, the soldier knows that the politician will not take it lightly. Forced to leave his life of dedication to the sword behind, he finds himself married to a woman known for her strange appearance. She is the last of the lord's daughters, never married because of the people's speculation that she was inhuman. The two are forced to live in the cold mountains of the north, just beyond where the dragon was slayed. Perhaps the lord sent him to this estate to ensure the dragon slayer will be the first to know of any remaining beasts, or perhaps he believed the man was perfect for his imperfect daughter. But, the family harbors a secret. One that could change the fate of their world forever.  

For this, you will be playing the soldier. From enemies to lovers, the two will find out that the daughter isn't entirely human. This revelation promises danger, uncertainty, riches, power, and more. Will the new couple have what it takes to overcome their peculiar circumstances?

I’m incredibly confident and love what my body can do now and really am happy with the way that I look and feel. I’ve been single since July and had coffee with one guy that I went to high school with… But it didn’t go anywhere despite him wanting to take it further. we just were not a good match and I don’t want to string someone along if I really can’t see it going anywhere… So it had nothing to do with my concerns about my body. I keep wondering if all of my loose skin is going to really put a damper on things once I do find someone I click with.

I’m very physically fit and have built quite a bit of muscle… I work out 3 to 5 days a week because I love it, but there is just no getting rid of loose skin without surgery. I’m hoping that will happen a few years down the road, but I’m not waiting a few years to search for someone special to spend the rest of my life with.

Has anyone here had the experience of dating after bariatric surgery whether you were the person who had the surgery, or you were the person dating them? I’m really afraid that it is going to be a major turn off for someone and I keep telling myself that the right person won’t mind… But that doesn’t really change the fear that I have. 

For the most part, and clothes I look really good and you can’t tell. Even though I’ve had the weight off for years I still get compliments on how good I look and I feel like I can be pretty objective in saying that my body looks good despite the loose skin… But when the clothes come off 😬 if it’s relevant, I wear a US size 10 and a size small or medium shirt. I really appreciate any responses… There’s no one that I’m involved with at the point of going to date at this point… Conversing with someone else on a dating app but we will see 🤷 just started thinking about this and thought I would ask.",3,1735409918.0,datingoverforty,19,1.0,False

1hobk6g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hobk6g,Moving tv from bedroom into open kitchen/living area ,"I would like to move my tv out of my bedroom. I am seeking suggestions on how to arrange my living area with the addition of my tv. It makes sense to me to create separate zones with furniture, but all of my attempts so far have resulted in awkwardly breaking up the flow of the room, feeling like I have to walk around my furniture, or feeling uncomfortable on the couch if my back is not to the wall. I also feel as though the entryway coming straight into the living area makes things a bit less comfy, as you can almost always hear traffic and voices from outside, so I have been trying to take that into consideration when arranging. I have tried having a smaller desk in my bedroom and the tv out in the living area, but I do work from home fairly frequently and it feels worse to me than the tv to have my office in my bedroom. I realize I’m constrained by space, but I am also considering that I may be overlooking something. Please feel free to suggest your best case scenario solutions (I realize there is no perfect solution in this space). Layout map (nearly perfectly to scale) included for your reference. 



What’s important to me:

1) TV out of bedroom

2) Office setup stays out of bedroom

3) Physical and visual “flow” of space through front room optimized

4) Feeling secure and cozy (especially when at couch and also at desk if possible)

5) Prefer that windows are not blocked by something like the tv but willing to consider it



Options I’m open to/have considered:

1) Adding a coffee table or a chair or two somewhere to further “block off” area with couch

2) Mounting TV high on wall behind desk

3) Getting rid of TV and investing in some kind of projector setup for wall behind desk

4) Putting piano in basement storage for now (really don’t play as much as would justify having it take up as much real estate as it does)

For this, you will be playing the soldier. From enemies to lovers, the two will find out that the daughter isn't entirely human. This revelation promises danger, uncertainty, riches, power, and more. Will the new couple have what it takes to overcome their peculiar circumstances?


If you've read this far, thank you! I hope to hear from you. If you decide to inbox me just send me a little about you and mention the word ""coffee"" so I know you've read to the end. This just helps me weed out those who aren't interested in what I'm looking for. Can't wait to talk to you!",3,1735409621.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

They talk like it's an easy job but I feel like making coffee is one of the hardest things.,"I work in a tech company and people act like programming is one of the hardest jobs out there. I'd disagree, it's child's play compared to making coffee. V60 tastes absolutely different if you pour it at a slightly different angle. I even fuck up the french press, the supposedly ""easy"" way. Baristas nail all that, and more. Not only they understand which process brings up what flavor, they can communicate all that to you in simple terms. Every barista I've met appeared to be studiously enthusiastic about their art.

If you fuck up code you can always follow your own trails and fix the problem. If your coffee's fucked it's fucked. God knows why.

Yet every time I see baristas mentioned online it's implied that it's a low-skilled, low-paying job anyone can get. It's one of those jobs you get when you couldn't find a job in your usual industry. I'm having a hard time reconciling that. Can anyone explain?",0,1735409577.0,TooAfraidToAsk,13,0.41,False

And I get a slight amount of redness (made worse in the areas I scratch). I find this weird bc I’m not allergic to anything ese with caffeine in it. Suppose my throat is a bit tickly too. I wonder what is causing this.

1hobhh8,https://i.redd.it/y0u6howkrm9e1.jpeg,Clarified (and slightly spiced) New York Sour,"[Repost because the first was removed for incomplete recipe] I know this was such a trend on this sub, but I do clarified milk punch every year around the holidays and this was my best so far!

(For 3 servings)

- 4oz Suntori Whiskey (chosen mostly for color)

- 2oz Lemon Juice

- 2oz Cinnamon-Cardomom Syrup (1:1 simple steeped with whole spices over the stove)

- 2 dashes each of angostura and orange bitters

- 2 oz of Whole Milk

1. Combine whiskey, lemon, syrup and bitters in a mixing glass

2. In a separate container, add the milk. Slowly pour the cocktail into the milk and wait for the mixture to curdle (~20 mins)

3. Wet a coffee filter (I used chemex) and place it over a mesh strainer. Strain the cocktail into a smaller bowl at first, set aside a larger container.

4. The first bit of liquid will not be clear, so move the strainer the larger container and add the liquid that filtered through back into the strainer.

5. Once cocktail is fully filtered, serve over large ice with a red wine floater!

I was very happy with how this turned out. Not too sweet or strong like my previous attempts have been. The only thing I’d change is the wine used because I only had some cheap red on hand. I would want something that had a slightly sweeter or more subtle profile.",29,1735409553.0,cocktails,7,0.92,False
1hobhaw,https://i.redd.it/z90p5xqjrm9e1.jpeg,Help for Delonghi Magnifica S,"I just bought a Delonghi Magnifica S ECAM21113B, but the coffee is very weak (see picture).
It barely grinds coffee (the sound is very fast).

Do you know if the settings are wrongly put?

I tried adjusting the coffee grind from coarse to thin, and also adjusting the coffee quantity, but to no avail.

My life has been hell. In particular when I decided to seek therapy but we dug too deep and I've spiraled into psychosis. That psychosis ruined me. I felt not in my body and still dont. I couldn't make for myself not even a cup of coffee. I couldn't listen to people's conversations. It was a disaster. After that I tempted suicide just to get hospitalized and in two years and a half I had 15 hospitalizations. I entered the psychiatrist loop, where I would hurt myself just to get hospitalized. There I feel safe and taken care of. The point is that after an hospitalization I end up feeling worse when I get home because I don't have all the care I had. I've realized that care is just an illusion. I need to change this loop. What can I do? ",1,1735409510.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False
