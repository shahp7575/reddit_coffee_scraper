• I have made more savings in a month than I expected

• My cravings have reduced

• I enjoyed intentionally made purchases way more

But the biggest change?

This felt like quite a big moment for us (not literally), mostly because we are usually very organized people (organized meaning “good at B2B things”).

Admittedly, we had not done a huge amount of research into the tools already available out there (research meaning we Googled a bit, clicked around, sighed, and made coffee). The first four tools we looked at were either very expensive (numbers with commas) or did not have pricing listed at all, which always makes us feel slightly nervous (financially and emotionally).

A bit of background (this may help, or it may not): we are historically B2B people. Enterprise-y. Dashboards. Long sales cycles. That sort of thing. Recently, however, we decided to do an app (an actual app, for actual people), which meant dipping our toes into B2C waters. The water was colder than expected (metaphorically).

Because of this, we needed something simple to track influencers. Who we contacted. Who replied. Who said “sounds great!” and then disappeared into the digital fog (not literally). We assumed there must be a lightweight tool for this already. There probably is. We just didn’t find one that felt right (right meaning affordable, clear, and not yelling at us with too many features).

So we built a small internal tool instead. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Then we looked at it and thought, “Other founders might find this useful” (founders being people like us, slightly tired, mildly optimistic, and trying to keep track of things).

We decided to open source it.

2) The first photo was my 1st print. The first print failed due adhesion failure of the magnet attachment stuck onto my build plate. I tried put super-glued it back and ran it 2nd time.   
The 4th photo is my 2nd print and i noticed the suction in between the fep plate and the printing part is too high, hence causing it to detach from the build plate. What kind of setting are there to resolve this if i want to remain the same design?

It's just way too much and I've tried so much already and I just can't get it to taste right. 

The coffee I'm using is 120Hz from kram.store (roasted by 19grams in Berlin on 5.11.2025) and I know that I do like it because I've used it before in my DeLonghi Magnifica S fully automatic machine. 

My parameters:
18g dose
Grind setting 3.0
Brew temp: 96C
Pressure is around 8-9 bars
Out weight: 37g (Aiming for 36g but I'm still figuring out when to press the button exactly)
Brew time: 28s

I have already wasted 300g or so making some of the worst coffees of my life trying to figure out what is wrong here. The coffee tastes kind of too much and sour, Bitter I wouldn't say at all. 

What I've tried already:
- Grind finer (up to the point of choking the shot)
- Just grind coarser (makes it very sour)
- Grind coarser and yield more (3:1 ratio), also makes it sour
- Increased the temperature from 94C (previous) to 96C (current)
- Step down to 17g dose with the same grind setting

I'm at my wits end here because I like this coffee but I can't get it to taste right on my new setup. It tasted so round and fruity and the mouthfeel was amazingly light and smooth on the DeLonghi.

1pzea27,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pzea27/is_it_disrespectful_or_am_i_being_controlling/,Is it disrespectful or am I being controlling/ coming from an insecure place.,"Okay, so my husbands mum is still friends and actively hangs out with his exes’ parents. I’ve said multiple times that I don’t appreciate it and that I find it weird. (They have no reason to be friends other than the fact their son and daughter dated. )

Even in the past with his last ex girlfriend, she came home with him once and his ex’s parents were literally in the kitchen having coffee. His last girlfriend cracked the shits about it and honestly, I would have too.

On top of that, his mum accidentally called me by his ex’s name (the same ex whose parents she’s still friends with). 

When I tried to explain how uncomfortable this makes me feel even as a mistake, she said, “What do you expect me to do, not be friends with them?” I didn’t want to come across as possessive or controlling, so I said no but that I just think if she puts that much effort into her relationships, maybe it should be with my parents, not her son’s ex girlfriend’s parents.

Like… don’t you think his ex would find it funny knowing his parents still invite her parents over and all hang out together? And that I have to sit there with them all night? It just feels humiliating. Although This could just be me overthinking and being insecure. 

Now here’s what has annoyed me: she’s hosting her birthday coming up. Last week, my partner and I joked saying, “Imagine if she invited them,” thinking that was far fetched and that she would never actually do that.

Well… today he found out that she has invited them.

Am I the asshole for not even wanting to go anymore? 
I’ve expressed how uncomfortable I am with this situation multiple times, and she just does not respect my opinion, hear me, or even take into account how the last girlfriend before me felt about it too. His mums also only ever had 1 man (her husband) so I feel she also doesn’t understand? Idk. 

OH and just reading this back I want to add his ex lives in another country and has a new man!! So he’s defs not with her behind my back or anything lol😂😂😂

Just to address the pushback before it starts : I’m not trying to control who she’s friends with or ask her to cut anyone off. I understand people can maintain friendships. What I am asking for is basic respect and boundaries. I’ve expressed multiple times that this situation makes me uncomfortable, and instead of that being acknowledged or adjusted, it’s continued and escalated to inviting them to her birthday. I don’t think it’s unreasonable to feel uncomfortable being expected to sit at family events with my partner’s ex’s parents, especially when this has already caused issues in previous relationships. She can be friends with whoever she wants. 

I want nothing more than a close mother/daughter in law relationship and I just feel like this puts such a spanner in it. If you’re reading this and you’re a mother in law would you do this to your daughter in law?

Hey,

Two more days before this year ends. Virtual hugs to those who are still alive and kicking. 🤗

Let’s have a time-out first, sip some coffee ☕️ and have some honest reflective self-assessment 📝. Here we come 2026! 🤔

About me: 35 yo, 5'3"", nerdy and confident enough to hold any variety of topics (from philosophy, psychology, even if we reach multiverse topics). But I also very much appreciate silence (if you are like me who can be contented by just observing people and things around even without talking to anyone). I live in QC but works in BGC. IT by profession, decent and with a sense of humor.

About you:

• Hoping for someone who has the same chill and light vibes (no negative vibes) 👊🏻

• No height preference

• ⁠no age requirement (I love to talk to varieties of people)

• ⁠decent

• Confident in herself 

• ⁠great smile and great eyes (just a bonus) 🤩

• ⁠working professional (but dont worry the coffee date is on me)

• don't be problematic, we can rant about some stuffs just to let it off our chests

I have sets of interesting topics and questions to ponder on, so no need to prepare. Just be yourself. We know, maybe this is the plot twist we've been waiting for.

I also have 360 view of QC if that’s what you are looking for.

1pze9yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1pze9yi/a_moment_of_love_that_i_will_always_remember_and/,A moment of love that I will always remember and treasure forever,"Sometime last week, one sunny afternoon, I witnessed what is, without question, one of the sweetest, most beautiful, and most profoundly romantic moments of my life. I genuinely thought it would be just another ordinary, uneventful day, mundane at best, but fate clearly had other plans. Even now, I realize I have not fully processed everything that happened. In the moment, I was carried entirely by excitement and a rush of elation that made time feel suspended. I am sharing this simply because I have never felt loved in this way before.



For context, we have all been at home during the Christmas break, settling into that familiar rhythm of rest, family time, and quiet days that gently blur into one another, especially during the afternoons. Everything felt calm, ordinary, and comfortably predictable, which made what happened next all the more unexpected. Completely unannounced, my significant other (SO) and my SO’s mom dropped by our house. They brought some of my favorite treats, along with dessert and coffee for my parents. I assumed it was simply one of their usual thoughtful visits.
I was wrong.



After greeting them, we stayed and settled into the lanai for snacks. Once everyone was seated, my SO sat across from my parents. He was calm and composed, yet visibly emotional. Then, with quiet resolve, he asked for their permission and blessing to marry me.



He explained that he does not have the ring yet and is not proposing just yet. He wanted to ask for their blessing first because, to him, that was the most meaningful step. He then turned to me, eyes glistening, and said that he could not imagine a life or a future without me in it.



He turned back to my parents and promised that he would always choose me, love me, take care of me, and work hard to give me the kind of life I have always known. He admitted that he might not be able to offer that life immediately after marriage, but he vowed to build it with me, steadily, faithfully, and wholeheartedly. He wanted them to know that I would never regret leaving behind the princess-like life that I have been accustomed to, because he would do everything in his power to make sure I am happy, secure, and deeply loved. Then, with a sincerity that stilled the entire space, he vowed to be faithful and true to me, persistently, perennially, and perpetually.



That was when my mom broke the emotional stillness with her trademark humor. Laughing, she said, “Are you sure about this? This is no return, no exchange raba ha!” The lanai filled with laughter, instantly easing the intensity of the moment.
My dad followed with a smile and added teasingly that he was glad my SO promised to love and choose me through all my moods and moments, even when I can be such a maldita. Laughter rippled through the group once again, and even my SO, still teary eyed, could not help but laugh along.



After that, my SO’s mom spoke. Her voice was warm and sincere. She shared that she had found me endearing from the very first time we met and that she had already welcomed me as her son’s life partner from the beginning. She reassured my parents that I would be in good hands and spoke openly about how deeply she admired the love my SO has for me. Her words felt like a quiet benediction, gentle, affirming, and deeply meaningful.



By then, my tears would not stop flowing. I was overwhelmed, grateful, and completely speechless. All I could manage to say was that I love him with everything I am, and that I do not care about leaving behind the life I have been accustomed to, because having him is more than enough.



Before my SO came into my life, I never truly believed that someone could love me in my entirety. Not just the polished and presentable version I showed to the world, but also the flawed, uncertain, and sometimes difficult parts I tried to hide even from myself. I had grown used to the idea that love always came with conditions, that people would admire fragments of me but never the whole. I believed affection was something you had to earn, not something freely given.



Then my SO appeared, and everything I thought I knew about love quietly unraveled. He saw the contradictions within me, the softness and the stubbornness, the calm and the chaos, and he did not flinch. Instead, he embraced them, as if every part of me made perfect sense to him. For the first time, I felt seen in my entirety, not as an idea or a projection, but as a human being worthy of love without pretense or justification.



It is almost unsettling, that kind of love. The kind that asks for nothing but truth. And yet, it is the gentlest thing I have ever known. He loves me in the spaces I once thought were unlovable, in the silences I believed were empty. In doing so, he has taught me that unconditional love is not a fantasy. It is a quiet, steady miracle that happens when two people choose to understand rather than fix each other.



I am still over the moon. Out of excitement and my usual curiosity, I asked when he plans to propose. He simply smiled and kept it vague, saying he would surprise me sometime within the first quarter of 2026.



Even now, I can hardly believe all of this happened. It felt intimate, sincere, and almost unreal, like something lifted straight from a dream. My SO is, in every sense, the answer to the prayer I never dared to speak aloud.",1,1767088792.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

He had a child at the age of 15. His son’s mother and whole family moved to across the country 5 years ago and and we both currently live in California. He will go every summer to pick up his son and stay there for 3 days when picking him up and dropping him off. She recently came back for 7 days with her son and my boyfriend is so happy to see his son. I am too, but I feel very strange her being here. I told him I’m happy his son is here but that if out of respect for me if he not go out to coffee or food or spend time one one one with her even with his son present. He said that they are both grown adults and that if the chance arises he will. I told him I don’t feel comfortable with that and if he does I’ll have to rethink our relationship. He got upset but we kept talking as usual after. The very next day I find out through his cousin that he went out with her and his son and his little brother to see Christmas lights.
When I confronted him he lied to me and said he didn’t but his cousin has so reason to say she was there if she wasn’t. I can see why he lied though because I’ve made it very clear I wasn’t okay with that. 
Am I in the wrong for being upset or feeling some type of way about this? 
He currently lost his job so I gave him my whole weeks paycheck so that he has money for his son while he’s here and I feel bad my money going to feed or taking her out. 
I talked to his mother about it and she said she believes it’s disrespectful of him to go out to eat or invite her to coffee or go out in general with her. 
I talked to my mother and she said there is absolutely nothing wrong with him inviting her to food or coffee or catching up because they share a child together.

I 23F have been with my boyfriend 24M for 4 years. His son lives out of state and this week his son and mother of his son came to visit. I asked him not to invite her out to eat or coffee or catch up one on one even with his son present. The very next day he does so and lies to me about it.

If you pull the lever, the single guy dies, otherwise the five die.

But ever thought about why there is someone working all alone on his own track while everyone else is together? Obviously, that's a fellow introvert! While the extroverts are busy bonding over coffee breaks, small talk and ""team morale"", this guy deliberately chose the quiet track so he could actually get work done, without stupid chit-chat.

Because of that, he's also most likely the super efficient draft horse of the whole railway company (and the only one who actually read the safety manual). Remove him and the company implodes in a matter of days, leaving those poor five survivors without a job and starving.

So here's the real question for the utilitarians in the room: How do you justify an ethical framework that consistently sacrifices introverts simply because they refuse to participate in forced workplace camaraderie?

Next year I’ll be starting my **5th year of Medicine**. I’m currently studying at my home university in Spain, where I’ve lived all my life, and I feel like I really need a change of scenery.

My plan is to go abroad for **one semester**, and I’ve applied for **both Erasmus and ISEP**. If I were lucky enough to get accepted into both, I’ve even considered doing **one semester with each program**.

• Is that a good idea?  
• Has anyone done something similar?  
• Is it manageable academically in Medicine, or too much?

**Please keep in mind that I’m a girl who doesn’t really enjoy partying or nightlife.**  
• I prefer **quiet activities**, such as going on relaxed trips or excursions, exploring new places, trying local food, walking around the city, having coffee, and **meeting people in a calmer way**.  
• **Partying is definitely not a priority for me**, so I’d really appreciate perspectives that take this into account.

# Erasmus (probably the most realistic option)

Right now, Erasmus seems more feasible. I’m choosing between **two destinations**, although I’m currently leaning slightly towards **Timișoara**.

# Ferrara (Italy)

From what I’ve seen:

• Ferrara is a **smaller city**, and it looks charming in a classic Italian way.  
• However, a big drawback for me is that **classes are taught in Italian**.  
• I speak **Spanish, English, and French**, but I’m not sure how realistic it is to **study Medicine in Italian**, even if it’s a Romance language.

Things I’d like to know about Ferrara:

• How hard are the **exams**?  
• Are there **adaptations or facilities for Erasmus students**?  
• What’s the city like for **traveling around Italy and Europe**?  
• Is the university organised?

Also, the **Ferrara website absolutely hates me**:

• I can’t see **timetables or schedules**.  
• The curriculum took me two days to find, and it’s split in a very confusing way because they recently changed the study plan.  
• Some courses belong to the old plan, others to the new one, and I honestly don’t understand how that works or if I can combine them.

• In **Ferrara**, I would be able to go for the **first semester and then extend my stay**, so that’s something to take into account.

# Timișoara (Romania)

At the moment, Timișoara might have a slight edge for me:

• Classes are **taught in English**, which is a huge plus.  
• It seems **more international**.  
• I’ve already been to another part of Romania (Iași) for a short summer course, and I **loved the country**.

I’d especially like to hear from anyone who has studied at **Victor Babeș University**:

• How is the experience for **Erasmus and international students**?  
• What are the **classes and exams** like?  
• How are the **hospital rotations and clinical practice** in Romania?  
• Do Erasmus students feel integrated?

• **Do they actually enforce the 80% attendance requirement** mentioned in the fine print on their website?  
• **Is it a problem if some subjects overlap in the timetable?**  
• Right now, I can only see the **first-semester schedule**, and my home university only allows me to go abroad during the **second semester, so I cannot extend my stay**.



# Practical questions (for both cities)

• How easy is it to **travel around Europe** from each city?  
• What’s the **realistic monthly budget** (rent, food, transport, travel)? (Romania offers like 2000-2500 for 5 months, and Italy doubles it, but it's also more expensive to live there - I guess)  
• Are there **student residences**? Especially interested in this for **Victor Babeș**. (I found some in Timisoara, but for other Universities)

• How much are **student residences? Do they offer food within the budget?**  
• How active and helpful is the **ESN** in each destination?  
• Are there **other exchange programs or opportunities** I should consider?

• How flexible are professors with **attendance and exam dates** for exchange students?  
• Is it easy to **fail exams**, or are Erasmus students usually treated more leniently?  
• How heavy is the **academic workload** compared to Spain?  
• What’s the **social life** like for medical students specifically?  
• Any regrets choosing one destination over another?



**ISEP doubts**

About **ISEP**, I’m honestly a bit lost:

• I can’t find clear information about **which destinations are compatible with my medical curriculum**.  
• The website that my university redirects me to doesn’t show **subjects, syllabi, or equivalencies**.  
• I’m not sure if **all ISEP destinations are available for my profile**, or how you’re supposed to check that.

If anyone has done **ISEP in Medicine**, I’d really appreciate knowing how you figured all this out.

It started with a phone call.

I work nights, remote customer support for a small logistics company. The hours are quiet, mostly emails, occasional calls from drivers who can’t find a warehouse at 2 a.m. That Tuesday night was no different. Coffee gone cold. Apartment silent except for the hum of my fridge and the ticking wall clock I keep meaning to replace.

At 1:17 a.m., my phone rang.

Not my work line. My personal phone.

The number was unknown, but local. I almost ignored it. Then it stopped ringing after exactly four rings. No voicemail. I shrugged it off.

Two minutes later, it rang again.

Same number. Same four rings.

I answered.

There was breathing on the other end. Slow. Controlled. Like someone trying to sound calm.

“Hello?” I said.

A pause. Then a click. They hung up.

I checked the call log. Both calls were listed as incoming. Normal enough. I blocked the number and went back to work.

At 1:26 a.m., my phone rang again.

Same number.

Blocked numbers don’t do that.

I felt that small pinch of unease in my stomach, the kind you brush off because nothing *actually* bad has happened yet. I answered again, keeping my voice neutral.

“Who is this?”

This time, there was no breathing. Just silence. Not static—clean, digital silence.

Then I heard my own voice.

“Who is this?”

It was unmistakably me. Same tired tone. Same slight rasp I get at night.

I pulled the phone away from my ear and stared at it like that might change what I was hearing. The voice repeated again, perfectly synced with how I remembered saying it.

Then another pause.

And then, quietly:
“I didn’t mean to wake you.”

My skin prickled. “How did you—”

The call ended.

I didn’t sleep after that. I told myself it was some kind of prank, maybe someone recording calls and playing them back. Unsettling, but not impossible.

At 3:04 a.m., I received a voicemail.

No missed call. Just a voicemail notification.

I almost didn’t listen to it. I wish I hadn’t.

It was eight seconds long.

I could hear my apartment. The fridge hum. The ticking clock. And my voice, whispering:

“He’s still awake.”

I live alone.

I unplugged my phone and sat in silence until morning, heart pounding so loud I was sure it would carry through the walls.

The next day, I checked my apartment obsessively. Locks. Windows. Closet. Under the bed. Nothing. No sign anyone had been inside. No missing items. No disturbances.

I convinced myself stress was getting to me. Lack of sleep. Too much caffeine. I went to work that night anyway.

At 1:17 a.m., my phone vibrated.

Unknown number.

I didn’t answer.

It rang again. Four rings. Stopped.

Then my laptop chimed. An incoming work chat message.

From my supervisor’s account.

“Can you check your phone?”

My chest tightened. I typed back, *Why?*

Three dots appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again.

“Because I just got a call from you,” the message read.
“You sounded scared.”

I stared at the screen. My call log was empty. My phone was still unplugged.

I typed, *I didn’t call you.*

A few seconds passed.

“You did,” she replied.
“You said you think someone is in your apartment.”

I didn’t finish my shift. I packed a bag and drove to my sister’s place across town. I didn’t tell her everything—just that I hadn’t been sleeping and needed a couch for a night.

At 1:17 a.m., her landline rang.

She doesn’t use it. No one does.

She let it ring once before answering. I watched her face change as she listened.

She covered the receiver and whispered, “It’s you.”

I shook my head, already backing away.

Into the hallway mirror.

I caught my reflection for just a second. My face looked normal. Exhausted, pale—but normal.

Then my reflection smiled.

I wasn’t smiling.

Behind me, my sister was still on the phone, nodding slowly, like she was being reassured.

She said, “Okay. He’s right here.”

I’m writing this from my car. I don’t know where to go. My phone keeps lighting up with missed calls that don’t leave records. Voicemails from places I’m not at. Voices that sound exactly like me, saying things I don’t remember saying.

If you get a call from a number you don’t recognize, and it sounds like someone you trust—

Don’t answer it.

And if it sounds like you…

Hang up.

I work remote and lately the second my laptop wakes up, my chest tightens a bit. Nothing dramatic happened, no big fight, no crisis. It’s just months of small stuff piling up: messages coming in before I’m even dressed, “quick” calls that eat half an hour, the feeling I should be grateful so I shouldn’t complain. The worst part is my home stopped feeling like home. I’d make coffee and already be thinking about what i missed overnight. I’d avoid leaving for a short walk because what if someone pings and i look offline. Last week i caught myself opening Slack on my phone while standing in line at the grocery store, like a reflex, and it freaked me out. So I tried one tiny change for a week: I made a separate user account on my computer for work only. Different wallpaper, no personal tabs, no socials, nothing. When i log out, work literally disappears. I also moved Slack off my phone and told my team “text me if it’s urgent”. It didn’t solve everything, but the edge came off. I can be in my kitchen again without feeling like I’m at my desk. If you’ve had that low level remote stress where it’s not a meltdown, just constant tension, what helped you the most?

I’m 24F, and this situation has been bothering me, so I’d really appreciate some outside perspective.

I have a close male friend (24M) whom I’ve known since high school, we’ve been friends for about 8–9 years. About a year ago, he got engaged to a woman his age. I met her for the first time at their engagement, and at that point she seemed polite and friendly to me and my best friend (24F), whom I’ve known for over 10 years.

However, after the engagement, my best friend mentioned that she felt something was “off” about the fiancée energy toward us. I didn’t feel the same way at the time and didn’t think much of it.

Fast forward to just before the wedding: my friend and I met for coffee when he came to give me his wedding invitation. Everything felt normal, he was excited, and I asked about the wedding schedule so I could plan around my exams (I’m a student). As we were leaving, he casually told me not to mention to his fiancée that we had met.
That caught me off guard. When I asked why, he hesitated and eventually admitted that his fiancée doesn’t like me or my best friend. This confused me, because we’ve barely interacted and live in different countries. Still, I didn’t push further and decided to respect his request.

At the wedding, my best friend and I attended because we were invited and genuinely wanted to be there for our longtime friend and be part of his big day. However, the bride completely ignored us no greeting, no acknowledgment, just cold shoulder despite eye contact. I even tried approaching her, but she walked away. The atmosphere made us feel genuinely unwelcome.

I told my friend that maybe we should leave early because I didn’t feel comfortable or wanted there. My best friend felt we shouldn’t let this affect our friendship with him and encouraged trying to talk things out later.

She did try reaching out to him afterward, but he hasn’t responded. At that point, I felt exhausted and uncomfortable with the situation. I don’t want to be involved in anything messy or cause tension in his marriage. If our presence makes his wife uncomfortable, I’d rather step back.

I’ve told my best friend that I personally don’t think I can continue the friendship the way it was, though she’s free to do what she feels is right. I’m hurt, angry, and disappointed because we were genuinely excited to celebrate his big day, but instead felt excluded.

Asking for advice that is it reasonable to let go of an 8–9 year friendship after something like this? Should I try harder to reconnect and ask what’s really going on, or is stepping back the healthier choice here?

So we went to different colleges a few months ago. Before then me and her had been as tight as possible, I considered her a sister. I was close to her family, and sometimes was over at their house when she wasnt home. Our friendship was great, and I always went out of my way to do whatever I could for it. I stood by her during all of high school when things got rough for her, socially, family wise, romanticly, etc. 
I've never been someone who liked showing my vulnerability to others, its one of my biggest flaws/insecurities. I dont cry in front of others. I ignore harsh words. I've always been the person to just keep moving. 
When we got to college, I found myself having doubts about my relationship. I would text her some of my worries and feelings. I did bring it up a few times because it had been over a span of time that this lasted. It was the biggest ""thing"" I’ve shared with someone. 

For the past two months, Ive been messaging her. Things that happened in my day or random stuff I wanted to talk about. The relationship above. A good coffee store close by. The only communication I got back (in early November) was ""sorry I've been busy"" when I was asking why she hadnt responded. (In which, shes had time to post multiple things to different socials and is very used to having close long distance friends for years). I kept texting her because I believed she was busy or going through something and wanted to keep up contact and be there for her. 
Yesterday I broke and told her how I was hurt that she wasnt responding. I asked if I had done something and for any kind of answer. 
I got this:

""Hey I wanted to take a minute to figure out what to say. Throughout the last year I feel that we’ve grown apart and going off to school has unfortunately added to that. I’ve felt the distance when we started talking about schools and I reiterated the fact that I was leaving [our city]. When this started coming up I felt that your demeanor changed and shifted negatively. After our last conversation I felt that deserved more from someone I considered a best friend and needed time. I think right now we might be in different places in our lives and I’m not saying I never want to talk again because I care about you and I feel that a little bit of distance could be good for both of us. When we both come home in the summer maybe we could reconnect and see how we feel."" 

I responded:
""I understand what you're saying and I'm willing to give that space to hopefully mend our relationship later on. I get how I could have seemed a lot more negative, a lot of what I spoke was probably complaints or my own worries. I do wish you would have spoken to me when this first started to be a problem, so that it could be addressed then or at the very least told me you wanted space. Getting ghosted by the person I considered my very closest friend hurt a lot. 

I hope everything in school and life goes well for the rest of the year.""

I wont say I havent been negative, a LOT of what we've talked about over the years was negative. The conversation she's referring to is when she called and was telling me about an insecurity she was having, and was putting herself down because of it. I was a bit rough because shes a wonderful person and was comparing herself in an unfair way to others. I tried to use the logic of ""if I was saying and thinking it, you would see what bs it is."" I dont think I did it well, and I dont hold any hard feelings on her for being upset about that conversation. 

I'm upset because I would never treat her how she treated me. If something she did hurt me, I would tell her. If she was getting to negative and was effect me, I would tell her. If I thought that I need some space from her, I would tell her. 

Any advice on what I should do next? All is appreciated. I'm not gonna message her, she wanted space and I'll give that. I dont think ive cried this much since I was 6.",1,1767087136.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

A Boxing Day to forget for Federica Albarello, 48, of Cologna Veneta. Four days ago, she had decided to enjoy the beautiful sunny day by stretching her legs along the Guà riverbank with her beloved four-legged friend Ciaky, a friendly, sweet, and lively 5-year-old red mutt. At 10 a.m., the Veronese woman, who lives with her partner Simone Zeba, had parked her car in Bagnolo and decided to ride up the bike path to the city center, with Ciaky on a leash. Shortly before reaching the fork in the road to the Lidl supermarket, Albarello saw a black and white male pitbull, without a leash or owner, coming towards her. Noticing the animal aiming for the little dog, Federica picked up Ciaky. The other dog reared up to reach its prey, causing Albarello to lose his balance. Having fallen to the ground, Federica was no longer able to protect Ciaky, who was mercilessly mauled. The large dog even dragged him off the embankment. Meanwhile, Albarello was screaming in desperation, but few people were walking along the bike path at the time. The first person to stop offered to shield her, but advised her not to defend her dog, who would have been helpless anyway. Another passerby offered to carry her and little Ciaky into the car and take them to the vet, who ruled the dog dead ""due to bite wounds from another dog.""

The search for the pitbull and the confrontation with the owner

Zeba, immediately alerted, returned to the Guà embankment and began the search for the pitbull. ""Two dog guards had been alerted and were looking for him,"" he says. ""I agreed with them to lend a hand."" It took the three of them two hours to find the dog and apprehend him. At a certain point, perhaps tired of wandering, the pit bull returned to a courtyard near the embankment, where the guards rang the bell, alerting the owner of what had happened. At first, the dog's owner seemed surprised, but faced with the evidence and the veterinarian's report, he had to admit his responsibility.

Consequences and Reflections

Federica, despite having already been treated at the Lonigo emergency room, returned to the hospital in San Bonifacio because she was experiencing severe pain in her left hand. She was discharged with a five-day prognosis. That same day, she also went to the police station in Lonigo to report the dog's owner for negligent assault. What saddens her most is having lost ""a faithful friend, who often accompanied us for coffee at the bar, or to the mountains when we picked mushrooms,"" Zeba recalls.

""Now Federica is scared and asked me to buy some pepper spray because she doesn't trust herself to go out alone: ​​I'll accompany her, at least until she recovers."" While the fear of assault can be mitigated by the company of her boyfriend, the void left by Ciaky cannot be filled.

My 9yr old daughter invited her friend for a sleepover. I said great! They played with the dogs, watched movies, did each other's make up, talked about boys, all the normal girly stuff. I was happy that even if I have to do PD we can still have a sort of normal life. Well that feeling didn't last long. I put the girls to bed so I could get PD started and told them we could get donuts in the morning. They were excited and quickly drifted off. The next morning I finished up PD, woke the girls and it was donut time! They finished getting dressed and I took my morning meds and we headed out. I spoiled them, they each got 3 donuts! They were all excited. We got home, they rushed out of the car, and headed to the kitchen to devour their donuts. I was just watching them smiling to myself. Then I got my coffee, stepped out of the car to join them and the next thing I know there's police officers hovering over my face. 

I'm freaking confused as hell. I keep blinking like I'm trying to wake up from a dream. Then I feel the floor beneath me. I'm on the floor!? What!? I try to move but the officer stops me. My head is spinning as I try to put things together. The officer says ""The medics will be here soon don't move. You hit your head pretty hard."" What!? He's right though I can feel sharp pain in the back of my head. What the hell happened??? Then I remember the kids and I ask where they are. They're with officers outside but they're fine. The paramedics show up and take my vitals. BP 100/50! I had passed out due to low blood pressure! WTH!? 

So apparently I stepped out of the car and got as far as the kitchen counter and boom, I hit the floor. My daughter ran over, and called out to me, when I didn't respond, that smart little girl called 911. I'm super proud of my kiddo, but damn PD! I'm sure calling 911 on your dad slamming to floor in front of you is going to be a therapy session later. My poor kiddo. 

So IDK why my blood pressure dropped so low that Sunday morning. I didn't do anything different from any other day. Same PD regimen, same solution strength, same time, same meds. Now I'm nervous. I mean what if I had passed out while I was driving. The kids could have been seriously hurt. I have a 30 min commute to work everyday. What if I pass out then? I did contact my PD nurse and told her all about it and she thinks they may have to adjust my something with my weight. I'm going to see her and my doc on Friday and they said they'd explain everything. This day was a bad one for me guys.",1,1767086399.0,dialysis,0,1.0,False

I do feel emotional hunger and sometimes cramps, but i realises i dont feel the hunger rumbling in my stomach.

 Now i have fasted 24 hours and still not hungry. I drink plenty of fluids, calory free ofcourse. Do i drink so much that i wont get hungry? Today i have been awake 6 hours by now, and drank 1 litre of sugarfree electrolyte water and 1 sugarfree sprite. And two black coffees.

I've noticed through the years that there's a difference between planning social encounters way ahead of time, and the social stuff that end up happening on the day of, sometimes randomly.

Many people I know have always tended towards the former; planning coffee dates way ahead of time and things like that. It's easier when you're massively busy of course, but it really does seem like it's the main sort of socializing some of my friends do.

But I realized the other day that, for some reason, I just thrive with and enjoy spontanious planning way better; not because I can't plan, because I've got a packed schedule as well, but because there's some sense of maintaining community to it.

I do local musical, and there's something wonderful about meeting the same people often, even if it's not explicitly to socialize. There's no need to catch up, and no requirement that we have to find topics to talk about, because we're just... Around. Same idea when I was at university; because most people lived close by in town, someone going ""Hey, let's hang at the harbor and maybe go eat?"" was easy.

As I grow older I'll have to make peace with the fact that that type of socializing isn't as common for people my age. People are busy, have kids and such, so planning is essential. I just make sure to savour it when something spontanious comes around!",1,1767086314.0,CasualConversation,2,1.0,False
1pzdm7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/FIREUK/comments/1pzdm7f/10_year_update_mistakes_and_learnings/,"10 year update, mistakes and learnings","1/1/26 is exactly 10 years since I started my FIRE journey, here’s my update and learnings. 

It began with 

\- £832k which came from 3 pensions and redundancy/salary I put into a SIPP/ISA/VCT/off shore bond.

\- House equity 378k.

\- Since I’ve added £163k from house downsize and £78k from savings and a small workplace pension. 

\- So in total I put in £910k. I’ve had £87k out in VCT tax relief and dividends. 

\- So net I put in £823k (with the downsize and extras going in over the last 18 months). 

My approach (which came from a IFA friends advice) 

Have a clear goal, mine was £3m wealth across SIPP, investments and property by the time I was 50, so I can then take net after tax £6k out per month for life, growing by 2% pa and help my kids with a house deposit. 

The process I followed 

\- Have a london/SE six figure job and live somewhere a lot cheaper I’m in the east midlands. 

\- Every year fill up the pension and isa, and then pay off more on the mortgage. So I maximise the pension assistance for the Gov and employer. I know this may not be financially optimal, but I like sleeping at night knowing I own the house outright. 

\- Consolidate all the pensions, I had 3 smaller ones, all had minimum level fees and all were very poorly invested, and if I had left them they would have made around 30% return over 10 years with high fees I’m guessing. 

\- Buy another house with a 100% mortgage, in an area that’s up and coming, something that’s a wreck in a nice road, and spend your weekends doing it up. So you can sell or rent this asset. I created my own 100% mortgage by funding the deposit from my main house equity (which has a offset mortgage). I now have two houses with no mortgage. 

\- Don’t waste money, I have a home coffee machine at home with a choice of syrups and milks. I spend about 15p on a coffee that is Starbucks quality, and I would not dream of paying their prices. On the other hand I have paid £600 to stay in a hotel that was one of the most memorable days of my life. I spend on things that I value and don’t waste money. I also took the spare toilet roll, pens, paper etc home from the amazing hotel and used it to save money. When I go to corporate conferences they often give away sweets, biscuits, pads etc, at the end of the conferences i hoover up anything not taken and give them to my kids for snacks and their school work. This is a mindset, make saving money fun and a challenge. Not because you have to save but because you enjoy the challenge. My partner and I laugh about the things we do to save money and have a competitive spirit on who is the tightest!

\- Keep learning, for example this Reddit group, I’ve learnt so much. Thank you. 

I was motivated by seeing my dad work very hard all his life and die a few months after retirement in his late 60s. He hadn’t done much for himself and was about to start living. So I also keep very fit and hope to live longer, semi retire and pass on wealth to my kids. As I never left home with a penny from my parents, and I would like to help my children. I didn’t get a degree education so this has been very hard.

My top learnings. 

\- Don’t trust investment to others, learn and consider who and where it’s going. I’ve paid over £80k in fees and probably could have achieved similar in a FANGS or all world tracker for small fees! I made a big mistake early on. 

\- Always have contacts and a plan for the days your face doesn’t fit at work. This has happened twice in my career. 

\- Consider part time retirement options, I’m at 4 days per week now and enjoy what I do, I wouldnt want any more retirement at the moment. I enjoy the travel and social side, but I can feel the brain slowing down, so it will come. 

\- Start building the part time after retirement income, I have a plan as to how I will work about 5 days a month to cover my bills, keep my brain working and pay for some decent travel, and social interaction. 

Today I’m at £2,355K portfolio and I estimate about £830k on the properties. So the original plan to have £3m split in thirds (pension, investments and property) has worked albeit im over in pension versus the other two pots. 

Best of luck with your journey. ",29,1767086300.0,FIREUK,8,0.89,False

Bit of an explanation for each one.

My favorite gemstone IRL is Amethyst, and it's my favorite shade of purple, next to Lavender.

I find Peridot a bit more on the annoying side, and some of her scenes make me want to throw a block of sharp cheddar at her.

Wasn't so fond of Yellow Diamond when I first saw her but quickly grew to be my favorite of the Diamonds.

The Rutile Twins are a pair I would love to know more about, come the release of Lars of the Stars.

White Diamond be like in Change Your Mind: ""You're my friend, now. \*takes over Blue & Yellow Diamond\* We're having soft tacos later!""

I love the cape that Jasper has in this episode, she just feels like a Cockroach with too much orange in a way.

I'm all for Nephrite, I just like the more centipede-like version more than the little acid doggo.

I find myself relating to Future Steven, with a lot of what has happened in my life.

Ruby & Sapphire. A perfect pair, like Peanut Butter & Jelly, or Coffee & an apple strudel. 

Lapis & Jasper to me feels like less of a ship, and more of them being trapped by Lapis, in fusion, and the fallout all that, that involved Jasper being Shoryuken'd all the way to the arctic from a boat.

I would love to be friends with Amethyst. She feels like someone I could talk to about everything, and someone I would love to hang around, doing whatever it is we love doing.

I feel like if I tried to become friends with Spinel, she would become either VERY clingy, or I might end up on the receiving end of a giant hand, either slapping or crushing.",1,1767086156.0,stevenuniverse,1,1.0,False

I’ve been playing low stress games before bed to help me wind down and I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations for games like Fruitbus and Lake? I guess games where you drive in an open world to complete tasks? Preferably without timers or death? I’ve thought about trying trucking games but I’m worried they might be too complicated. 

Some other games I’ve played before bed:
Cozy Grove
Animal Crossing
Coffee Caravan (car vibes)
Fantasy Life
A little bit of Bear & Breakfast
Cult of the Lamb
Fallout 4 & New Vegas (these are a little too stressful atm but are favorites of mine)

i was with my little brother who is 11, and she asked us both what our weights are and said that we look smaller than our weights are. she said my weight is more than she thought and she kept asking me to repeat it like she couldnt believe it. she said that im tall so that ""makes up for it."" she's also asked me about my weight before. i was showing her a picture of my friend and she said that my friend and people who are chubby can't wear crop tops. she asked my weight and i told her, and she told me i can still wear crops tops because even though my weight is more than she thought it would be, i still ""look good."" it's like.. she's no longer saying the obvious inappropriate things that she used to say when i was younger and moving on to this. it just makes me more confused about her intentions.

i guess my question is, what do i do? it's been around two years since she's left as our nanny, but i've not been able to let go of this for more than that time, and i haven't been able to stop seeing her either. i never see her with my brother, but my brother wanted to this time. i also noticed that before i see her, i get ""excited"" but i just feel.. like very anxious even though im excited. like my hands were shaking. maybe its because i had coffee

I really like lisbon’s specialty coffee scene, but i keep failing at finding places where it feels normal to open a laptop for a bit. not trying to sit there all day or take calls, just do some quiet work with a good coffee. for example, i went to Liberty. great coffee, nice place, but i couldn’t really tell if laptops were actually welcome or just tolerated. some people had them out, others didn’t, no signs, no clear vibe. i ended up closing my laptop because it felt a bit awkward.

This has happened a few times now, so i’m wondering:  
Am i just bad at finding the right spots? Or is it kind of normal here that most (specialty) coffee places are more coffee-only?

In the morning I normally take Vyvanse and I switched to half caff coffee after hearing about the effect of Luvox on the half life of caffeine. The amount of caffeine makes no difference, I’ve tried regular, decaf, half caf, no coffee, no change in my sleep. 


It really, really sucks because Ive been on a bunch of meds (Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Prozac, Cipralex- all with poor results), but Luvox has been like a miracle except for the insomnia. I can’t believe what a difference it has made. But I also am a SAHM and I can’t function on this little sleep, especially when I’m afraid to add more caffeine into the mix.

I'm new here. Looking for others who are pationate about the mystery genre who might be interested in beta reading my first novel, ""Something Old, Something New, Something Deadly, Someone's Blue"". I'll drop some quick info and a bit of the first chapter below. If you'd like to read the whole manuscript and share some feedback please reach out. I'd be extremely grateful!

  
What it's about:

Maggie Baker has seen a lot in life. She's been married, raised children, and laid down roots in a small East Texas town she calls home. How does she now find herself divorced in her sixties and living alone? Accompanying her friends to a wedding is not exactly what she would prefer to be doing, and yet, here she is. She has no idea that this extravagant destination wedding in a scenic coastal lodge and spa, will turn into a deadly disaster! Will this proper southern church lady discover new ways to put her curious nature to use? Is she about to discover the next chapter in her life? Will she even survive long enough to do so? Follow Maggie's adventure in ""Something Old, Something New, Something Deadly, Someone's Blue""!

What I'm hoping for:

- General feedback! (Did you like it? Was it easily readable? Was there a good mix of likeable and unlikeable characters? Was the ending too easy to figure out?)

- Do you feel like Maggie had understandable growth during the story?

- Was the pacing good? Was there enough going on pre-murder to peak and keep interest?

- How does the accent play? (I'm a prolific comicbook reader and accents are usually portrayed phonetically which is what I've done as well to make sure her accent comes across to the reader.)

- Is it offensive in any way? I DO NOT wish to offend ANYONE, of any background. I don't believe there's anything of the sort herein but I'm one person of a particular background and not versed in everything and everyone so I know I can and will mess up at times. (I ask this because: My main character is older but very forward thinking and accepting. Still I try to keep her realistically behind the times in some ways. Other characters are intentionally off-putting or misunderstood. I want to be realistic without inadvertantly writing something that may cause offense.)

Some notes/warnings for prospective betas:

- Some adult language. (Infrequent uses of D\*\*\* and Sh\*\*)

- Brief non-graphic descriptions of crime scenes and bodies

- The views of the characters in this work do not necessarily reflect the views of the author. (Some do, some don't. You'll propbably get the sense of me but I try not to directly state my views and stances, preferring to let my work speak.)

I've posted the first couple of pages below. Please reach out if you're interested! Let me know you're preferred format and I'll be happy to direct message the manuscript to you. I have no strong set timeline but I would like any feedback sooner than later so I can get started on revisions.

Thank you SO MUCH for your interest and willingness to look over this post.

Mack :)





The first couple of pages:

Getting divorced will really ruin weddings for you. At least, that was Maggie’s theory as to why she was suddenly so frustrated. Not only was she having to travel halfway across the country for two people she barely knew, but she suspected she’d be subjected to memories of Jeff all weekend. She really wasn’t in the mood. “Damn it! Aw hell!” she mumbled to herself as she dug veraciously through her bags in the DFW Airport terminal. “Must’a left it at the house.” she murmured in her signature East Texas drawl.

 

Magnolia Baker, or Maggie as she’d insisted on being called, practically since birth, was always losing things. She chalked it up to menopause, but here she was, years later, still scattering bits and bobs across airport bench seats. Without her iPad, she’d have to find a mirror in a powder compact or use her phone to check herself, which would be just fine if she wasn’t going blind. Of course, she was all primped and ready to go when she was picked up earlier that day, but airport security is always hectic, and something always ends up going astray. She pulled out her phone and got the camera facing forward, which may have taken longer than she cared to admit.

 

First the hair. It was shorter with a little wave, dark brown with auburn highlights, and not a grey in sight. It looked just like it always had, at least as far as anyone remembered anymore since she’s had it done that way for over twenty years. There wasn’t a single thing wrong with it. Still, she took out her travel brush and ran it through the sides to make it just so. 

 

The camera also reminded her that she left her red cheetah print readers on her head. She put them on to check her face. ‘Good on blush and powder.’ she thought. ‘Lips?… Ugh.’ She never liked how wide her mouth was; her mother used to tell her that’s why she talked so much. She told herself dark red lipstick helped. Still, it never looked just right, so she touched it up a little and popped her lips a couple of times for coverage. Her brown eyes were always squished into a squint by her round rosy cheeks that never rested with the little smile she always seemed to have.

 

“Enough of that. Now, where is he with the coffees?” she muttered again to herself. She looked around but didn’t spot him. She sat back in her chair in the cold muggy airport terminal, watching planes come and go on a dreary rainy day, waiting for her plane that she wished wouldn’t arrive. She was dreading this trip for months. Weddings weren’t the easiest for her since her husband Jeff left her. She never expected to be divorced at all, much less in her sixties, and thinking about it made her feel like she wasn’t much fun, and the last thing she wanted was to rain on two naïve and innocent kids’ parade. Seeing the two happy young people, and the dresses, and the tuxedos, and the flowers just made her feel like a stick in the mud. She was especially dreading this wedding, in particular, though.

 

The bride wasn’t the problem. She’d only met her once in passing and didn’t remember anything about her, but Maggie knew the groom, Nate Lachey, pretty well. He was a sweet, gentle, and quiet young man who was close to her ‘shirt-tail’ nephew Zack.

 

Nate wasn’t the problem either though, it was his parents, Tom and Lillian Lachey. Tom was the ‘Bathroom King of Crystal Ridge Texas’, at least according to his many TV and radio commercials. Lillian had a very exclusive and expensive holistic medicine and chiropractic clinic. Maggie knew them from church; on the rare occasion they’d actually show up. Tom was tall and broad shouldered with giant baseball mitt hands, and a big pumpkin head. He was nice enough, until you poked the wrong button. He had a temper and when he’d pop off, you’d better plug your ears and run for high ground. Lillian could only be described as a witch with a capital ‘B’. She had the sourest face in the county and a look from her would send you straight to hell in a handbasket. They weren’t older than 45, but she looked ten years older at best.

 

Lillian was one of those women who didn’t wear make-up or dye her hair and wouldn’t think twice before giving you a passive aggressive little dig about it. She loved to insinuate that she was morally superior in some way, like being more of a feminist because she wasn’t a stay-at-home mom, or that she loved her kids more because she never took them to a doctor or to get a vaccination. Maggie had gotten onto Lillian’s bad side when she tried to intervene, after her old friend Eileen Braithweight spoke up one Sunday in Church. Lillian was regaling the other young mothers with her more modern parenting decisions like using herbs and oils instead of medicine and letting the child choose if or when to take a bath. Eileen, in her well-worn condescending tone, stated disingenuously, “You really shouldn’t say that so loud, darling. I don’t put my nose in other people’s parenting, but the Sheriff and his wife are right over there, and I believe the police take kids away for neglect.”

 

Funny enough, Maggie was traveling to the wedding with Eileen herself. The thought of the two women seeing each other and going at it again was exasperating.  “Help me Jesus…” Maggie muttered under her breath yet again, only this time, catching the attention of one of her traveling companions.

 

“What was that?” Eileen asked, thinking Maggie had said something to her.

 

Maggie turned to look at her friend sitting there next to her. Eileen was well into her seventies but aged very well. Her snow-white hair was curled up onto her head the same way it had been since they met. Her brows were penciled on with marksman-like precision. Her nails were a topey pink color that Maggie called ‘nursing home pink’. However, no one could question that the manicure was perfectly done, as always, by Michelle in the little salon behind the Target. Eileen was big boned. Truly. That’s usually the nice way to say fat, but Eileen was truly big boned, tall, and a bit imposing if you got her worked up. She was of course, dressed to the nines as she was known for, being a mainstay of Crystal Ridge society.

 

“Eileen, I was askin’ the lord to help me keep you and you-know-who as far away from each other as possible all weekend.” Maggie explained.

 

“Don’t worry. I’ll keep my distance… I can’t say the same for my cane though.” she replied, carefully holding her mouth open and applying her signature red lipstick. They both chuckled knowingly to each other, while Eileen continued to check her makeup in the small mirror of her compact. She mimicked swinging her cane like a baseball bat and they laughed even more. They always did have fun. 

 

“You’re awful sometimes! I tell you what!” Maggie said.

 

“Oh, hush up Maggie Baker. You might give my grandson the idea that I'm not a proper lady!” Eileen joked back.

 

Zack walked up carrying coffees for the three of them. “Grandma, I haven’t thought that since… ever, actually. Especially since you had a beer at family dinner and told us all what you would do to Chris Hemsworth if you ever met him.” he said. Eileen blushed and then the two women broke into a full cackle.

 

“Well now you’ve done it!” Eileen said as she suddenly rose from her chair, “I laughed so hard I peed a little. I’ll be right back!” She walked off, cane in one hand, purse hung on her folded other elbow.

 

Maggie and Zack sat sipping their coffee and staring out the window for a moment. Then Maggie decided to end the silence. “So, what’s she like?”

 

“Who?” he asked.

 

“The bride! I haven’t met her yet. Well, not really. I know your little friend of course. He’s a sweet boy. What’s she like though? All I know is she cleans for your grandmother.” Maggie chimed.

 

“She’s great. She’s really good for Nate. He hasn’t been this happy and confident… well, ever.” Zack replied.

 

“Aw. That’s real cute. Have I seen her around?” Maggie asked.

 

“You haven’t seen her at Grandma’s?” Zack questioned back.

 

“You say that like I’m always at your grandma’s house. Tell me, when is Eileen ever home to visit?” Maggie retorted.

 

“True, true.” he admitted. “I don’t know if you’ve ever seen her around then. You run in different circles.”

 

“Not even at church?” she asked.

 

Zack scrunched up his nose. “Nah, she’s not a church type. She’s more into, like, crystals and stuff.”

 

“Ohhh. Interesting... You know, they say boys always marry their mother…” Maggie insinuated.

 

“No, no. Naomi’s sweet and kind. Not… like Lillian. You’ll really like her I think.” Zack replied.

 

“Oh good.” Maggie accepted.

 

A bit of an awkward silence sat in, so Maggie continued. “Is her family from Crystal Ridge? I used to know everyone but it’s growin’ so fast lately.” she asked.

 

“Nah, they’re from Dallas. Nate and Naomi have been up there a lot more lately.” Zack replied.

 

“Mm… and they get along okay? I’d be more than a little irritated if I was forcibly related to Tom and Lillian.” Maggie knew she shouldn’t pry or be nosey. She just couldn't help it sometimes.

 

Zack pursed his lips in a little knowing smile and looked up at the ceiling. “Yeah… I’ll just say, from what Nate tells me, they have their own issues. When you have a lot of money, you’re relationship with your kids gets… weird.”

 

“With the bride to be?” she asked.

 

“No. No. Naomi’s very chill about that stuff. She has a sister…” He shifted awkwardly in his chair. Maggie nodded. The gossip had shifted to people she didn’t know so she didn’t feel the desire to keep pressing. Silence set in again which was odd. Zack usually couldn’t stop talking.

 

Maggie wanted to know what was up. “Well, are you excited? You’ve never been in a wedding before, have you?”

 

“A little.” Zack replied, “Tell you the truth, I’m kind of dreading it.”

 

“Yeah,” she thought to herself, “I knew there was somethin’ up, and whatever it is, I can tell it’s juicy.”

 

“What?! You sound like me! And I’m an old divorcee! You’re a young handsome guy. Be excited! It’s gonna be fun. Weddings are a great place to make new friends, baby boy...” Maggie insinuated strongly in her perky drawl.

 

“I just feel like there’s going to be drama.” Zack replied.

 

One thing about Maggie Baker, is that she knows how to get things out of people. Whatever he was skirting around was clearly getting to him. However, this wasn’t her business and she knew that, so she decided to throw him an out. “Don’t you worry, I’ll watch your grandmother. I can tell she just loves that little Naomi from all the talk about her. Eileen won’t start anything with Lillian on her big weekend.”

 

“Not that drama. I’d love to see Lillian take a cane to the back of the head... It’s other stuff.” he admitted.

 

“You wanna talk about it? You know I don’t gossip… much.” Maggie said with a wink, and a smile that’ll make you feel like you just got a warm hug from your mom.

 

“You’re joking but I’ve seen y'all yapping away, getting your hair done.” Zack replied.

 

“Oh fine. I promise. Not a word to your grandmother.” she said.

 

“Fine.” he acquiesced, “But seriously. She’ll flip out.”

 

“Fine. Fine. Now spill it son.” she said, raising her eyebrows as she sipped her coffee.

 

“There’s this girl that’s going to be there this weekend who’s been flirting with me… and I’ve kind of been flirting back.” he seemed to admit.

 

“You don’t have to hide that from her! You think she’ll embarrass you?” Maggie asked.

 

“No, no… Well yes, she’d definitely embarrass me. But that’s not the thing.” Zack replied.

 

“Oh well then what?” she asked further.

 

“I found out she’s…” he trailed off.

 

“What? One of them LGBTs or somethin’?... Not that I have a problem with all that, I just don’t know how to talk about it correctly.” Maggie admitted.

 

“No…” he said, exhausted by her old generation sensibilities, “it’s nothing like that Aunt Maggie.”

 

“Well, what then?” she pushed.

 

“…She’s married. To a man.” he admitted, throwing in a little joke to cut his own guilt.

 

“She’s married!?” Maggie exclaimed in shock.

 

“Wha-t?!” Eileen squawked in concerned confusion as she returned to the seats.

1pzd8fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1pzd8fm/mental_gymnastic_news_after_a_break_up_from/,Mental gymnastic news after a break up from twenty years ago,"Hi all, 

Throwaway account because my main is tied to me. 

I have a story and it does have some adult content and triggers (talks of suicide, depression) I’ll keep out descriptors as best as I can. 

Back in January 2002, I, 19 years old at the time, had just graduated high school and was taking a break from post secondary to work to earn extra money before I went to university. 

Her, a 16 year old girl I met on a local gaming forum. We had common interests in video games (Final Fantasy, Ragnarok Online, Phantasy Star Online etc) and our friendship started with a lot of back and forth on AIM which lead to phone calls every day. Some would go well into the evenings. We had exchanged photos online and eventually gained the courage to meet up in person a month later for coffee at Starbucks at a local mall in February. We were both taken by one another in person. It was a really cold morning and had previously snowed so we walked around the local park and settled on a bench to kill off the rest of our drinks. 

I had never been asked out by a girl before so when she asked me what I thought of her, it was the first time I was stumbling on my words. She asked me if I’d want to go out with her and I said yes. Sure enough, she kissed me right there. We huddled on the bench for a little while longer and made plans to hang out the next day as I had to work and she had a project she was finishing up. 

The relationship was surreal at the beginning. We went out together. She was initially always happy and encouraging - just new sensations and experiences I’ve never felt before. Not long after, I lost my virginity to her and the love making was incredible. She was fantasizing about certain scenarios and would try on outfits or want to try new positions. We were both happy. Or so I thought… 

During our relationship, we shared a similar background of not having dads in our life. Mine left when I was 13 and hers left more recently due to his alcoholism and abusive ness towards his wife and kids (she had two siblings) 

As the months passed by up to the end of the year, she ended up moving in with me and my family as her and her mother had a major falling out and she was thrown out of her place. Her uncle came to pick her up and help her collect her things like clothes, school stuff, games, essentials. We had no idea what was going to happen next. She was also a smoker but she was going through more cigarettes at this point due to stress. 

Living with her was more ups than downs. We were still very intimate but we had to be a bit more quieter in terms of that and our gaming between PC and our consoles. I began to see cracks forming where she’d expressed certain thoughts and tendencies such as saying she was damaged, had dreams I left her, that she sometimes wished she didn’t live - mind you, not all at once. Her darkest thoughts came over a year into our relationship. As a young, stupid kid I had no idea what to say or do. I asked her if she wanted to talk to a therapist but she refused and at certain points would lash out at me. She’d apologize later for it but the more it happened the harder it was for me to endure as I was getting frustrated and didn’t know how to help her. 

At some point, her and her mom decided to try and reconcile. She expressed she wanted to try to get back on her moms good side again (albeit her mom was a condescending narcissist as I learned and as my own mother had pointed out) she seemed to have wanted to try and make it work. At that point she had started dating this new guy and she seemed happier - until one day her mom accused me of using their phone to place bets on horse races (which I guess was a thing but I had no idea) and even after accusing me for two days, asking me to pay her back, her boyfriend fessed up and said it was him and he’d pay her back. 

I got zero apologies for it. Re-enter the narcissist once again… there were other incidents of blame as well but I didn’t come around the house much to give her any kind of reason to blame me. Though one time when her mom was out of town she wanted to get revenge by having sex on her bed. This was a big deal because her mother was an insane neat freak and wouldn’t even let anyone in her room because she was a major germaphobe. 

Our relationship was still very stable at the time and she seemed to have gotten a lot better. It was her graduating year (2004) at this point (she’s 19 and I’m 22) her grad was a cruise on the water where her graduating class celebrated by dinner and a dance on a decently sized rented yacht. It felt like that point things were lining up. I was in my 2nd year at uni and she was planning on her next steps. 

Two weeks later, her and her mother had a falling out once again, but this time about rent money and her not being able to find work. She ended up coming back home with me - this time hauling her PC I had purchased as well as her usual stuff.. this wasn’t an issue to me because I was working while still going to school and my family and I were still well off that it wasn’t a big deal. 

She expressed to me at the time she wanted to take a break from school for a year like I did and I told her I’d support her and she can figure it out. Her uncle even offered to help her out financially but I did my best not to burden him. 

At this point we were playing an MMORPG with a bunch of local friends and a few out of towners. That summer after her grad and when she moved back in with me, we all got together from our guild including the out of towners and ended up doing a big bbq at one of our friends place. One of the nights I couldn’t go because of work and told them to have fun without me - this part will be important later. 

She called me that night saying she was going to go to one of the girls house to stay over for the night and I can just pick her up in the morning, which I did. We all got together that night again for another bbq dinner and it was a good night. 

We had some downs in between summer and Christmas. Once again, negative thoughts were clouding her judgement and that was when she expressed at one point she tried to take her own life before we met. She told me that if we hadn’t met then she didn’t know if she’d have the strength to carry on. The way she said it to me felt different this time… and this was after the party. We were also spending a lot more time in game, specifically with one of the guys who was visiting from a town four hours away. 

Fast forward to Christmas of the same year - she finally found a job starting in January and at that point, she wanted to once again reconcile with her mom and since she was going to earn money, wanted to move back home. Again, we were fine (or so I thought) I asked her if she was sure she wanted to move back in with her and she said it was important to her. I didn’t argue or plead with her, I wanted her to stay as her mom was just not doing her mental health any favors - even her own uncle suggested staying with me but she was adamant. Something just didn’t sit with me but I supported her decision. 

New year. 2025. Night of my birthday. We went out with friends to see a movie, dinner, bowling and drinks. Her mom was away again as well as her siblings so we went back to her place. Work had been going well for her and she got me what would have been my final gift which to this day I still technically have, but after the break up, I stored photos and mementos hard to throw away into a tin cookie box and gave it to my mom to put in storage. 

We got half way into the hallway to her room when she stopped me before the turn where the vanity mirror was, asked me to turn my back towards the mirror and began to make out with me, to the point we made love right in the hallway facing the mirror. She wanted to see herself having sex and made this unexpected move. 

She told me she wanted to have a baby. She took my condom off and told me again she wanted to see herself getting pregnant and was serious about it. I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with this girl and I wanted kids eventually. So, we went for it. We ended up starting back at each other in the mirror for twenty or so minutes talking about what we just did and what our next steps were. She said she wanted to move out and get our own place together. I had the finances - though at the time before the housing market was nowhere near as insane as it is today, I was saving for a down payment on a condo which at the time I didn’t tell her I had about 15% that was needed for approvals. I wanted to surprise her with this as I was already speaking to a financial advisor and already hit pre approval. 

A few weeks after everything, she changed in a short time. I know she was gradually going through something but it got to a point where she’d stop calling or texting me. She was not online and she never had the cell phone I was paying for with her. 

April 22nd, I’m at work and I get a call. It’s her. 

“We’re finished. I need you to take your stuff today” 

My heart had sank into my stomach. I was trying to plead with her why she was breaking up with me. No answer. Just “pick your stuff up today or I’m throwing it all away” and then hung up. My boss asked me if I was okay which, I wasn’t obviously. I had no idea what the hell was going on. He told me to take the rest of the day off and go get my stuff. I called a friend of mine to come with me as I didn’t think it was a good idea to go alone - it was a mutual friend of ours and she also had no idea what was going on. 

We get to her place and I call up the buzzer. Her moms boyfriend said “we’re coming down with your stuff - just stay there” 

About 10 minutes later of heavy pacing and my friend trying to calm me down, my now ex girlfriend with her mom and her boyfriend put down three boxes and a backpack of my belongings. I tried to talk to her asking why she was doing this but I ended up getting grabbed by the throat while she’s standing there watching this with literally the most stone cold expression that sent me chilly. My friend rushed to my side and grabbed his wrist and arm and threatened to break it if he didn’t let me go. Her mom just said that this was it and to leave. All three of them just went back in and didn’t even do a double take. I was an emotional wreck at this point and just slumped against the trunk of my car and just cried and confused. My friend did her best to console me and just said “look, let’s grab your shit before someone else does and regroup and figure this out” 

My friend ended up driving us while I sat in the passenger seat trying to get ahold of my now ex girlfriend’s uncle. He told me to come by to talk to him because he was confused about the whole situation. 

He heard about what was about to go down but she never gave a reason and it was her mom that was basically exclaiming that “this is how it’s going to go now” almost like it was her plan or she was handling it. Her uncle said that she’s generally not THAT controlling and apparently this was my ex’s decision but there was no reason given. 

Fast forward to summer. A few months after our break up. We still had mutual friends from our game. By this point, the guild had broken up as we were co leaders and I didn’t want anyone taking sides. I was invited to hang out for the day with another one of our mutual friends because she was supposedly worried about me. I was getting better and was getting ready for year three at university. 

We ended up getting to our destination with the friends and I. And this is when she let something slip. 

Recall the year before at one of our bbq parties. The night I couldn’t go because of work, my ex stayed overnight at the friends place (the one who I was with) and she had let it slip that my ex and the guy from out of town had shared a bed together that night, that she even admitted they looked good together. 

I had a moment to think of this. Because the next thing she told me was that they ended up hooking up after my ex left me. The friend must of had some kind of mental lapse because she basically let it slip that they hooked up at that party while we were still together. At that point her friend tried to backtrack but I told her that she literally said what she said. 

She ended up confessing that her and the other few friends thought they looked good together. That he was collected, already in a career and could take better care of her without her, my ex, needing to worry about things financially. The friend told me that she still loved me even up to the end, that I did her no wrong, but she wanted certainty in her life and with me working and going to university, I was not in a place in my life where she felt comfortable. 

It was at this point, my heart sank into my chest again. All I could think about were how she could do this to me and, because of my medical background, all I wondered was if I needed to take blood and STD tests. I ended up telling them they were all dead to me and ended up leaving them and headed back home. I never saw them again. 

I reached out to her uncle the next day and asked if he knew. He found out shortly after all that day when my friend and I picked my stuff up. I guess because he was more enticing (clearly more well off than me) her and her mom felt reconciling worked as her new boyfriend was handling her expenses and all that. 

For the longest time I was in a mindset that I never thought I’d experience. I thought about suicide. I was depressed. I felt these feelings of uselessness that I lived with. I tried to get counseling through the university but it was tough and I ended up pausing my studies on my last year. My grades at this point were slipping and I couldn’t think of anything else. 

Three years later, after being single for so long (tried to date but nothing worked out and I wasn’t in the game/content to just die alone at this point) I met a girl who showed me a friendship that was similar to how my ex and I met. This kind of warmness. We ended becoming friends and stayed that way for awhile until one day, about a year into our friendship if she’d ever consider dating damaged goods like me. She laughed and said “no refunds, right? I can live with that!” 

We married four years later. 

Fast forward to today. I mean literally today. Life is good. I don’t have many complaints aside from little things like forgetting to pick up certain things for dinner the next day. 

I ran into my ex’s uncle while grocery shopping of all places. The last time I saw him was 10 years ago after I had moved out of the city. He pats me on the shoulder and tells me I look amazing. Just complementing me. Still a sweet guy. I asked him if he had time for coffee and he said he could use a drink. 

We caught up on life and avoided talking about my ex until the end when he told me there was something that I needed to know. 

He told me that after we broke up, my ex was exhibiting what was morning sickness. It turns out that the day she broke up with me she did a pregnancy test and she was positive. From what I understand, she was torn between me and this other guy. Her mom convinced her to go with him, that he’ll be so much better for her in the long run. She also said she could continue to live at home but she needed to abort the child. Which… she did. 

Just to appease her mother and this narrative. 

I found out that my ex and the guy didn’t last very long. Turns out he was a manipulative scumbag (would explain why her mom liked him so much I guess) and that she ended up moving on, meeting someone and having a kid with that guy a short time later. 

As I write this long novel out, the more I write it, the more I realize that I dodged a long term issue. What I guess still kind of hurts the most was that she had given in and took something precious away from both of us. Even if she had carried it to term, I would have stepped up hard. I told my wife tonight about this and she said that she would have supported me raising a kid from a previous relationship. No questions. 

Unfortunately for me today, cancer had a hand in making a decision on having kids with my wife - to which we cannot. Which is something we have accepted as we are blessed with a gorgeous god daughter and two young nephews from either side. I’m always with a car seat so we are definitely not missing out on the experiencing of helping to raise a kid. The benefit is we can give them back. (Insert evil laughter here) 

There’s a point to me writing this long thing out. Mainly for therapy. I hope that my story somehow offers some solace that things find a way of working out provided you help yourself first. Life goes on. There’s uncertainties and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t fond of the time I spent with my ex. It wasn’t a waste but definitely a life lived and many lessons learned. I hope nothing but the best for her as I have no desire to ever see her again. 

If I can and still live my best life, there’s hope for everyone who has had their heart broken. 

Thank you for reading this.

1pzd83g,https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/comments/1pzd83g/lara_late_evening/,Lara - Late evening,"Chapter 0: Lara \~ Late Evening

Lara glanced briefly at the clock. It was already past ten.  
Her reflection was faintly visible in the window: tired eyes, messy hair, her back hunched in a posture that would give any orthopedist nightmares. She looked like her mother, always escaping into work while her private life quietly fell apart. Lara had sworn she would be different. Life had long since proved her wrong.

Here she was, alone in an empty office, while everyone else had been gone for hours, probably stretched out on their couches watching shows. Tonight was worse than usual. The new boss didn’t like her, she was sure of it. From the very first introduction, when he’d greeted her with that fake smile and squeezed her hand just a little too hard, she’d known they wouldn’t be friends. And she’d been right. He was never satisfied—not with her work, not with her motivation, not even with her clothes. One could only guess what his problem was, and why he’d decided to latch onto her in particular.

She was sick of being picked apart by him every single time. But she was too stubborn to quit.

Tomorrow she had another one of those awful review meetings, and of all days, there was an error somewhere in her calculations that she just couldn’t find, no matter how hard she tried. If she didn’t fix it, it would be a gift-wrapped feast for him. And she was absolutely not going to give him that satisfaction.

The rest of the office lay silent. Only her monitor glowed in the darkness. The harsh light made her eyes ache. Between the desks, the rolling cabinets stood like mute blocks; everywhere the same Post-its, the same mugs, the same half-empty glasses of water. Somewhere in the distance, the ventilation system hummed. Nothing else. No creaking chairs, no murmurs, no footsteps. No other person.

Lara yawned, arched her back, and tried to breathe the exhaustion away. The fourth coffee hadn’t made her more alert, just shaky. Her concentration was gone for good. Even if the error in the spreadsheet suddenly started flashing red, she’d probably miss it.

Maybe cold water would help. And a few minutes of movement.

The hallway was empty. The motion sensors switched on with a slight delay as she passed. A row of fluorescent lights flickered briefly, then steadied. She didn’t like the building at night. The familiar corridors suddenly felt foreign, too long, too quiet. Her thoughts grew louder the quieter everything around her became. She wondered where her ex was right now. She hoped karma would eventually get around to him.

In the women’s restroom, she turned the faucet only halfway. She held her hand underneath, waited until the water was properly cold, then leaned forward. The icy splash against her face was like a slap—but the good kind. Goosebumps crept over her arms and neck. She looked into the mirror: sallow skin, red eyes, flushed cheeks. No surprise after fourteen hours.

Maybe it would be best to just give up and look for something new after all. Starting over was annoying, sure, but maybe there was even more money somewhere else. Why was she putting herself through this, anyway?

She pulled the last paper towel from the dispenser, patted her face dry, and tossed it away. When she opened the door again, the hallway felt even quieter than before. The ventilation was still running, but softer now, as if the pressure were missing. Lara paused for a moment, irritated, without quite knowing why. Then she continued toward her office, telling herself she was just working herself up over nothing again.

After a few steps, she heard a sound.

A dull thud, not loud, but so unexpected that she stopped instantly. It sounded like something had tipped over. The noise came from the end of the hall, where the small janitor’s closet was located. It had been sealed off for a week—renovations.

“No one is allowed in there,” they’d told her. “Not even the janitor.”

She listened. Nothing.

Then, after a few seconds, there was a faint scraping sound.

“Mr. Schubert?” she called down the hallway.

No answer.

Great. She definitely hadn’t imagined that noise. But who would still be in the building at this hour?

She hesitated, then started walking down the corridor anyway. The carpet ended, linoleum began, slightly springy beneath her steps. The yellow caution tape in front of the closet hung loose, as if someone had simply pushed it aside.

“Hello?”

She pushed the door open. The light was on, a single fluorescent tube on the ceiling, flickering slightly. The room was barely three square meters: two metal shelves with cleaning supplies, a bucket, a stack of rags. The smell of chlorine stung her nose.

A shallow puddle spread across the floor. The water came from a leaky hose under the sink, drip by drip, always in the same spot, until it formed a small trail leading toward the wall.

“Well then,” she muttered. “So much for ‘sealed off.’”

She crouched down and tightened the tap until the dripping stopped. For a moment, water still trickled out, then only a thin thread, and finally nothing at all.

She straightened up; some vague sense of duty had been fulfilled, and she was just about to leave when her gaze caught on the shelves. The back panel didn’t seem to merge directly with the wall behind it. Between metal and concrete was a narrow gap, almost invisible, but deep.

Lara squinted. There was no plaster behind it. No concrete.

Just darkness.

She leaned closer, a draft brushed against her. It didn’t smell damp.  Not like chlorine, really, it didn’t smell like anything at all.

A dull clatter made her spin around.

Just the stupid broom that had tipped over.

Still, her heart was racing now. “Damn it.”

She took two steps toward the door and peeked into the hallway. The lights out there were flickering more strongly now; entire rows went out briefly, then snapped back on. The motion sensor reacted as if something were standing in the corridor—something she couldn’t see.

“Is anyone there?”

No answer, just the hum of electricity.

But the tingling at the back of her neck grew stronger.

Lara stepped back into the janitor’s closet, and a sound behind her made her whirl around on the spot.

There was nothing. Just shelves, cleaning supplies, a bucket.

She looked again at the gap behind the shelf. Something was different. The shelf stood slightly farther into the room, as if someone had pushed it forward just a bit.

She pulled her phone from her pocket and switched on the flashlight. The beam cut through the gap—and revealed an opening. After just a few centimeters, the light was swallowed by black depth.

“Okay…” she murmured.

She stretched out her hand, placed her fingers on the edge, and felt along it. Her hand slid farther in than she’d expected, into empty space, without hitting brickwork or pipes.

The light in the closet began to flicker. Once. Twice. Then it grew dimmer, as if someone had turned down the color setting. The fluorescent tube was still on, but the light was warmer now, yellowish, making the room look old and unfamiliar.

This building really deserved a complete renovation.

She took a step back. Her back bumped into the other shelf; bottles clinked softly. A brief electrical click sliced through the air. Lara held her breath.

She should just leave. This definitely wasn’t her problem.

But curiosity edged past reason. Why hide a passage in a janitor’s closet of an office building?

She leaned forward again and shone the light deeper inside. The draft grew colder. Her phone’s flashlight began to flicker slightly, as if the battery were suddenly weakening.

Just a quick look, no one has to know.

She grabbed the shelf with both hands and pushed it aside. It squealed across the floor, then stopped, just far enough for her to squeeze through sideways.

Lara took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness.

Above her, a weak light flickered on: a trembling strip along the ceiling. She stood in a long, gray, old corridor. Bare concrete, cold floor, walls without paint. Nothing exciting.

So much for that.

She turned around to go back and froze.

The janitor’s closet was gone.

Behind her was nothing but a smooth concrete wall.

Her phone flickered once more and went out.

She has to comment on EVERYTHING no matter how small or insignificant it is. 

I was making some food over the stove and without hesitation she starts playing with the controls and turning the heat down and leaning across me saying; “well, this is going to burn to a crisp if you’re not careful”. 

It is 100% a control thing. She doesn’t want me to do my own thing because she thinks that her input is important. This is despite the fact I live on my own and I am more than capable at the age of 30 of making a bowl of rice. 

Another day I was making breakfast and she was tidying up AROUND ME while I was cooking. I had made basic eggs on toast or something and she’s like “You are so messy, I can’t believe this, what a mess”. “There’s crumbs everywhere”. “There’s egg in the pan”. I’m literally just making food. Chill out woman.

She needs to get a life. 

I just want to enjoy my food in peace. FOR ONCE. It is impossible. Can I please just sit down without somebody hovering around me…. forcing me to shovel down my food because I just want to get out of there as soon as possible. 

It’s got to the point where I’ve stopped cooking food at her house. I just order stuff in because it annoys her or I just to out for breakfast away from her prying eyes. And she’s like “that’s a waste of money”. And I’m like “Oh no, I don’t care”. She’s only annoyed because she isn’t getting any food and because she can’t control what I have. 

I LOVE food. But around her it just makes the thought of eating anything stressful. 

The most annoying thing is making a drink. 

We have kettles here that you have to boil water to make tea or coffee. 

The moment I turn it on, she instantly appears out of nowhere. I won’t even know she’s in the house and like the bat signal she appears behind me and will be like; “IS THERE ENOUGH WATER IN THERE FOR ME”. 

No, I wasn’t boiling it for you, you muppet. I was making a drink for myself. Please just wait your turn. 

She then stands right next to me while I am putting coffee in a cup and will budge your arm so you spill coffee granules. She will then try and slam her mug down really quickly and get a tea bag out the cupboard to steal the water. 

I have never met a more annoying person in my life. 

She does nothing all day. But HAS to save 2 minutes because waiting for the kettle to boil again would be the end of the world and ruin her day. 

The other day she did it for about the third time and I lost my temper and literally shouted;

“Please can you f-cking wait a minute for once in your sad f-cking life”. 

She then starts playing the victim but fortunately my siblings were in the room and were like; “yeah you are being really annoying”…. She thought they were going to stick up for her….. then had a massive strop and wouldn’t speak to me for a solid day and a half. 

The entire thing is just so unnecessarily draining. 

Savour your tea and coffee when the narc is not around…. my god. It is fucking bliss just being in silence and not having a lunatic hovering 24/7. ",2,1767084846.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False
1pzd7fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1pzd7fw/we_took_a_detour_and_found_a_diner_that_shouldnt/,We Took a Detour and Found a Diner That Shouldn’t Exist,"We called it the trip of the year, a chance to break free from the suffocating grind of college life, an impulsive decision born over too many late-night study sessions and caffeine highs. Our destination was supposed to be an adventure, a cabin in the mountains where we could forget about exams and papers, at least for a weekend. But what we got was something else entirely.

The three of us had always been close, each of us playing a part in our peculiar little trio. There was me, Jason, the designated driver and unofficial planner. I liked to think of myself as the one who kept us grounded, the one who knew how to read a map or change a tire when things went wrong.

The others liked to joke that I was born thirty years too late, that my knack for analog solutions and my mistrust of GPS meant I was more suited to road trips of the '80s than the tech-filled caravans of today.

Then there was Leah. Leah was the spark, the reason this trip existed in the first place. She was always the one with the ideas, the kind that started with “Wouldn’t it be crazy if…?” and ended up with us sneaking into the campus library after hours or setting out at midnight for a spontaneous drive to the coast.

Leah had a wild spirit, the type that made you believe anything could be fun as long as she was around. She was impulsive, unpredictable, and exactly the kind of person you wanted next to you when life started feeling too routine.

And finally, there was Eric. Eric was the quiet one, thoughtful, skeptical, but always game once Leah managed to convince him. He was the kind of guy who preferred stability over chaos but found himself often choosing chaos simply because Leah and I were his friends.

He kept a book in his backpack at all times, claiming you never knew when you might get a chance to read. Leah teased him about it endlessly, but deep down, we both knew that Eric’s bookish demeanor kept us from wandering too far into dangerous territory, at least most of the time.

The trip had started out smooth enough. The plan was simple: leave campus Friday afternoon, drive for a few hours, and reach the cabin by nightfall. We were armed with snacks, a playlist Leah had curated called “Songs for Escaping Reality,” and Eric’s stack of travel guides and trail maps.

“I swear, this playlist is going to change your life,” Leah said, grinning as she cranked up the volume. The first notes of a classic rock song blared through the speakers, and she started nodding her head to the beat.

Eric rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Yeah, yeah, until you play that one weird techno track that you always sneak in.”

“Oh, come on! It’s all part of the experience,” Leah shot back, winking at me in the rearview mirror.

“As long as it keeps us awake,” I said, keeping my eyes on the road. The sky was blushing with the colors of sunset as we left behind the sprawling cityscape and ventured into the countryside.

Everything was perfect until it wasn’t. A detour sign appeared on the road where none should have been, and our GPS lost its signal somewhere in the rolling hills.

""Uh, that's weird. Was this detour here last time?"" I asked, frowning as I slowed down.

Leah leaned forward, squinting at the sign. ""Who cares? It’s an adventure, right? Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"" She flashed a grin, her enthusiasm infectious as always.

Eric, sitting in the back, sighed. ""I don't know, guys. Detours that aren't on maps tend to end up in horror movies,"" he said, but there was a hint of a smile on his face.

""Oh, come on, Eric. Don’t be such a buzzkill,"" Leah teased. ""I promise, if we end up in a horror movie, I’ll save you first.""

""That’s reassuring,"" Eric replied, rolling his eyes.

We weren’t worried, not at first. I had maps, after all, and Leah had a sixth sense for adventure. We laughed about it, teasing each other as the sun dipped lower, the horizon melting into a deep, inky blue. The mood was light, Leah making jokes about the ""mystery road"" and Eric reluctantly joining in.

""Maybe we'll find buried treasure,"" Leah said, her voice tinged with excitement.

""Or a cult,"" Eric added, shaking his head. ""Hopefully not a cult.""

We passed fields and forests, the headlights cutting through an increasingly lonely road, the kind where you started to forget you were even part of the world anymore.

It was Leah who first pointed it out... the flickering neon sign glowing faintly in the distance.

“The Last Stop Café,” it read, in faded letters.

Leah was thrilled, immediately insisting we pull over. She called it a “classic roadside experience,” her enthusiasm spilling over into her voice as she spoke of milkshakes and greasy fries served in places just like this.

Eric sighed, a small reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. “Might as well. We’re lost anyway,” he muttered, glancing at me.

I hesitated.

“Come on, Jason, where’s your sense of adventure?” Leah’s voice broke through my thoughts. She leaned in, her eyes sparkling. “I bet they have the best milkshakes.”

“Yeah, the kind with extra mystery ingredients,” Eric said drily, but he was already unbuckling his seatbelt.

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as we pulled into the lot, the diner standing solitary under the night sky, its windows glowing an eerie yellow. The place seemed oddly empty.

“Anyone else getting a weird vibe from this place?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

Leah laughed, already halfway out of the car. “You always think too much, Jason. It’s just a diner!”

Eric shrugged. “Let’s just grab something to eat. It’s probably fine.” He paused, looking at the darkened road behind us. “Though it is kind of… isolated.”

“But that’s what makes it an adventure!” Leah declared, stretching her arms. She turned to me with a grin. “Besides, I’m starving. Let’s go!”

I followed them toward the entrance. The door creaked open and we stepped inside. The diner was small, with red vinyl booths and a long counter lined with chrome stools. A lone waitress stood behind the counter, giving us a polite smile.

""Welcome in, folks,"" she said, her voice warm. ""Sit wherever you'd like.""

Leah immediately pointed to a booth near the window. ""That one! It’s got the best view,"" she said, practically bouncing over to it.

Eric and I followed, settling into the booth. I couldn’t help but notice how empty the diner was, just us and a few other patrons who seemed lost in their own world.

As I looked closer, I noticed the other patrons more carefully. There was a man sitting alone at the counter, staring into a cup of coffee.

In the corner booth, an elderly couple sat side by side, neither of them speaking. The woman was looking out the window, her expression blank, while the man seemed to be fixated on a spot on the table, his lips moving as if he were muttering something under his breath.

Eric followed my gaze and raised an eyebrow. ""Not exactly the liveliest bunch, huh?""

Leah shrugged. ""Hey, it’s late. People are tired. Besides, it’s kind of nice to have the place mostly to ourselves.""

The waitress approached our table. She handed us the menus without a word, her demeanor far less welcoming than before, and left without waiting for a response.

Leah opened her menu first, her eyes widening. ""Whoa, guys, check this out. There are actual rules in here. Like... rules for eating at a diner?""

""Rules?"" Eric asked, raising an eyebrow as he flipped open his menu. ""What kind of rules?""

I glanced at my own menu, noticing a laminated page right at the front titled 'House Rules'. Leah cleared her throat dramatically and began reading aloud.

""Rule 1: Do not ask the staff about the diner's history,"" she said, pausing for effect. ""Oh no, we can’t talk about the mysterious past of the creepy diner. What a shame.""

Eric snorted. ""Yeah, right. Like anyone actually cares about that.""

Leah continued, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm. ""Rule 2: Do not enter the restroom alone. Well, I guess I'm on my own if I need to go. Thanks for nothing, guys.""

I chuckled. ""Maybe they’re just really big on safety. Or maybe they just don't want anyone wandering off and getting lost in their haunted bathroom.""

""Rule 3: If the neon sign outside flickers, close your eyes until it stops,"" Leah read, her eyebrows shooting up. ""Close your eyes? Are they worried about seizures or something?""

""Rule 4: Avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if you hear someone calling for help,"" I read aloud, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, that’s oddly specific.""

Leah grinned. ""Maybe they just don't want us to steal their secret recipes.""

""Or maybe it's where they keep the bodies,"" Eric added, his tone deadpan.

""Rule 5: If someone sits in the booth across from you with a blurry face, do not speak to them,"" I read aloud, glancing at Leah and Eric. ""Blurry face? What does that even mean?""

Eric laughed. ""Maybe they just don’t want us talking to strangers.""

""Rule 6: If the power goes out, stay seated and do not speak until the lights return,"" Leah read, her smile fading slightly. ""Okay, that one’s just creepy.""

""Probably just a gimmick to make the place seem spooky,"" I said, trying to keep the mood light.

Leah nodded, then read the next one. ""Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder.""

""Rule 8: Do not answer if your name is called by someone you don’t recognize,"" Eric read, his voice taking on a mock-serious tone. ""I guess no new friends for us tonight.""

""No complaints here,"" I said, chuckling.

Eric flipped to the next rule. ""Rule 9: Do not look under the table for any reason.""

""Okay, now they’re just messing with us,"" he said, shaking his head.

I took a deep breath before reading the last rule. ""And finally, Rule 10: Under no circumstances should you leave the diner before 3:00 a.m.""

""I guess we’re stuck here for a while,"" I said, attempting to lighten the mood but failing to hide the unease. ""Hope they really do have good milkshakes.""

Leah waved her hand dismissively, her grin still intact. ""Oh, come on, Jason. It's just a cool marketing gimmick. You know, like, come for the creepy rules, stay for the food.""

Eric nodded, though he seemed to notice my tone. ""Yeah, it’s definitely giving off haunted attraction vibes. They probably get a lot of late-night thrill-seekers in here. I just hope the food lives up to the hype.""

We turned our attention back to the menus, scanning through the classic diner options. Leah tapped her finger against the table, deciding between a burger and a milkshake. ""I think I'll go for the double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. You can't go wrong with the classics, right?""

""I'm getting the pancakes,"" Eric said. ""Breakfast for dinner never disappoints.""

""I guess I'll go with the burger, too. And maybe some fries to share,"" I added.

The waitress approached again, her demeanor just as cold as before. She pulled out her notepad and asked, ""Ready to order?""

Leah smiled up at her. ""Yeah, I'll take the double cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake.""

Eric nodded. ""Pancakes for me, please. And a coffee.""

""Burger and fries, and a coffee for me,"" I said.

The waitress scribbled down our orders without a word, her eyes barely meeting ours. As she turned to leave, Leah spoke up, her tone playful. ""So, about these rules... Are they just for fun, or do you actually have people trying to break them?""

The waitress paused, her back still to us. Slowly, she turned, her expression more serious than ever. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" she said, her voice cold and unwavering. ""You should follow them. Every one of them.""

Leah laughed, clearly amused. ""Wow, you're really committed to the bit. It definitely keeps the creepy vibe alive.""

Eric nodded in agreement. ""Yeah, it adds to the atmosphere. Very immersive.""

The waitress didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away, her footsteps echoing again in the empty diner. I couldn't help myself. I called after her, a smirk on my face. ""Hey, what about the history of this place? Any ghost stories we should know about?""

The waitress froze mid-step. Her body stiffened, and she turned her head slightly, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes... wide, almost terrified.

Suddenly, the lights in the diner flickered, dimming until they cast only the faintest glow. The air grew heavy, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt it... a presence, a sensation of someone breathing down my neck.

The laughter from Leah and Eric seemed to fade, and suddenly, I realized the diner was silent, too silent. My eyes darted around, and to my growing horror, I saw that Leah and Eric were no longer there.

The booth across from me was empty, as if they had never been there at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I slowly turned my head, feeling the intense pressure of something right behind me.

I turned fully. Inches away from my face was a figure, a blurry, pale face staring straight at me, its eyes wide and hollow. It was there for just a split second, but it was enough to send a jolt of fear through me. I gasped and jerked back instinctively, my body colliding with the table. I lost my balance, falling hard onto the floor, the sound of the crash echoing in the empty diner.

Suddenly, the lights flickered back to full brightness, and Leah and Eric's laughter filled the air again, as if nothing had happened.

""Nice one, Jason,"" Leah said, still grinning. ""Really going all in on the creepy vibe, huh?""

Eric chuckled, shaking his head. ""Bravo! I like how you're getting into character. Keeps things interesting.""

I forced a smile, but my eyes darted around the diner. Something had happened, something real. I could still feel the lingering coldness, and a sense of wrongness gnawed at me. I leaned forward, lowering my voice. ""Guys, I'm serious. There was something behind me. I felt it. The lights, everything just went... off.""

Leah rolled her eyes, still grinning. ""Oh, come on, Jason. Don't try to freak us out now. You're just adding to the atmosphere, right?""

Eric shook his head, his smile not quite fading. ""Yeah, man. I gotta admit, you're doing a good job keeping the creepy vibe alive. But seriously, relax.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but Leah nudged me playfully. ""Bravo on the acting, by the way. Really sold it. Now let's just enjoy our food when it gets here.""

I tried to shake off the feeling, but the cold dread settled deep in my chest, refusing to leave. It felt like something had changed, and I couldn't quite put it out of my mind.

A few moments later, the waitress returned, balancing a tray with our orders. She set down Leah's cheeseburger and milkshake, Eric's pancakes, and my burger and fries. The food looked surprisingly good, steam rising from the plates, and for a moment, I almost forgot the strange encounter.

""Finally! I'm starving,"" Leah said, rubbing her hands together before diving into her burger.

""Pancakes look decent,"" Eric added, pouring syrup over them. ""Not bad for a creepy diner in the middle of nowhere.""

I nodded, though my appetite had waned. I took a bite of my burger, the taste barely registering as I kept glancing around, my eyes flicking to the other patrons and the shadows in the corners of the room.

""What's up, Jason?"" Leah asked through a mouthful of fries. ""You still on edge?""

I hesitated, then spoke. ""I can't shake it, Leah. When the lights went out... I swear, there was something behind me. I saw a face. It was inches away.""

Leah and Eric exchanged uneasy glances. Leah's smile faltered for a moment. ""Jason, seriously, enough. You're really starting to freak me out now.""

Eric set his coffee down, frowning slightly. ""Yeah, man. If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Just... stop, okay?""

I forced a smile, trying to brush off their reaction. ""I'm not joking, guys. It felt real.""

Leah shook her head, her expression torn between amusement and discomfort. ""Okay, well, can we just drop it? Let's try to enjoy the food.""

Eric nodded, his gaze shifting to his pancakes. ""Yeah, let's just move on. This place is creepy enough without us making it worse.""

We ate quietly for a while, and surprisingly, the food was actually really good. Leah was halfway through her cheeseburger, her earlier unease replaced by her usual enthusiasm. ""I have to admit, this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time,"" she said, her voice cheerful again.

Eric nodded, his pancakes already half gone. ""Yeah, pretty solid""

I tried to relax, taking a bite of my burger. It was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were perfectly crispy.

Leah wiped her hands on a napkin and then got up, glancing towards the back of the diner. ""Alright, I hate to say it, but I need to break one of those scary rules,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Restroom time. Guess I'm going solo.""

Eric gave her a look, half-amused, half-concerned. ""You sure about that, Leah?""

She laughed, waving him off. ""What, you think I'm going to get sucked into the haunted bathroom? I'll be fine. Just keep my milkshake safe.""

I watched as Leah made her way towards the restrooms, her confidence unwavering. But something in my gut twisted with unease, and I found myself unable to look away until she disappeared behind the restroom door.

A few moments passed, and I tried to distract myself, picking at my fries. Eric was scrolling through his phone, oblivious to my anxiety. The diner felt quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead suddenly grating.

Then, a scream pierced the air. My head snapped up, and I saw Eric's eyes widen as he turned towards the restrooms. Without thinking, I jumped up from the booth, my heart pounding as I rushed to the restroom door. I slammed it open, the door crashing against the wall.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the small, tiled space.

Leah was on the floor, her hands covering her face. She was trembling. I kneeled down next to her, my hands hovering just above her shoulders. ""Leah, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?""

She shook her head, her voice barely audible. ""There's... there's something in the stall. I saw it.""

I glanced towards the stall she was pointing at, my stomach churning. Carefully, I stood up and moved towards it, each step feeling heavier than the last. I reached out, hesitating for a moment before pushing the stall door open.

It swung wide, revealing nothing but an empty stall. I turned back to Leah, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at me, trying to get a glimpse inside.

""There's nothing here, Leah,"" I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm. ""It's empty.""

She shook her head again. ""No... no, I swear, Jason. There was something. It was there.""

I helped her to her feet, her hands still trembling as she clung to my arm. We walked back to the table, Leah leaning heavily against me. Eric stood up as we approached, his expression a mix of concern and confusion.

""What happened?"" he asked, his eyes darting between us.

Leah sank into the booth, her face still pale. ""There was something in the stall, Eric. It... it was crawling towards me.""

Eric frowned, shaking his head. ""Leah, come on. Jason already freaked me out earlier. If you're trying to do the same thing...""

""No!"" Leah snapped, her voice trembling. ""This isn't a joke. There's something weird going on here. It's not just a marketing scheme.""

I nodded, my eyes meeting Eric's. ""She's right. Something's off about this place. We need to take this seriously.""

Eric hesitated, the doubt still evident on his face. ""Alright, fine. But... what exactly did you see, Leah?""

Leah took a deep breath, her eyes still wide with fear. ""It had four legs, like... like an animal, but no head or body. Just legs. And it started moving towards me from the stall. I screamed, and then Jason came.""

Eric stared at her for a moment, his expression shifting from confusion to discomfort.

He sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Okay, enough. This is getting way too weird, guys. I don't know if I believe it, but... it's really starting to freak me out. Can we just stop and try to chill for a bit? I need some air. I'm going outside."" Eric pushed himself up from the booth, grabbing his jacket. He shook his head, his expression a mix of skepticism and unease. ""I don't care about the rules or whatever is supposed to happen here. I just need a cigarette.""

""Eric, wait,"" I said, my voice urgent. ""You can't just go outside. The rules...""

""Forget the rules, Jason,"" Eric snapped, his frustration clear. ""I'm not staying in here. It's too much."" He turned and headed towards the entrance, not waiting for Leah or me to respond.

Eric reached the entrance door, pushing it open, but as he stepped halfway through, he froze... literally frozen mid-step, his body rigid between the diner and the outside. His hand still held the door, and his whole form seemed almost like a mannequin stuck in motion.

""Eric?"" Leah called out, her voice shaky. ""What are you doing?""

I stood up, my heart pounding. ""Eric, come on, man. Stop messing around."" But there was no response, he was utterly still. Leah and I exchanged a nervous glance, both of us unsure of what to do.

""Is he... okay?"" Leah whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

I shook my head, slowly stepping away from the booth. ""I... I don't know. He looks like he's stuck."" I moved closer, my eyes darting around the diner. The other patrons were no longer lost in their own worlds; instead, they were staring at Eric, their eyes unblinking, their heads fixed.

""Leah... they're all staring at him,"" I muttered. She turned her head, her breath catching in her throat as she noticed the other patrons' fixed gazes.

I moved cautiously towards Eric. Just as I was within arm's reach of Eric, his body jerked violently, as if some unseen force had pushed him back. He flew into the diner, crashing onto his back and sliding several feet across the floor.

""Eric!"" I shouted, rushing to his side. He was gasping for breath, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. I grabbed his arm, helping him sit up. ""What happened? Are you okay?""

Eric's eyes darted around wildly before locking onto mine. His voice was shaky. ""They're there... outside. They're there!""

I glanced towards the open door, but all I could see was darkness beyond. I helped Eric to his feet, and together we made our way back to the booth, Leah's face stricken with fear as she watched us approach.

""What the hell happened?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling.

Eric collapsed into the booth, his hands shaking. He took a moment to gather his breath, then began speaking. ""I stepped outside, okay? I needed air. I moved around the side of the diner and lit a cigarette.""

Leah's eyes widened, and she interrupted. ""Eric, no, you didn't. You were just in the doorway. You were frozen there.""

We all exchanged glances, both terrified and confused. Eric shook his head, bewildered. ""No, I swear I stepped outside. I was out there. While I was having my cigarette, I started hearing something calling me from just around the diner. I went to the corner and peeked around it, but there was nothing.""

He paused, his eyes darting between us as he continued, his voice trembling. ""I looked closer and started noticing movement in the dark. It was like... a face, detached from anything, just staring at me. Then the darkness seemed to get even thicker, like it swallowed everything else.""

Eric's voice dropped to a whisper. ""I turned back towards the entrance of the diner, but it was dark there too... pitch black, like nothing was there. And then I heard it... this shushing noise, closing in on me. I can't explain it, but it was like something was surrounding me. I felt this sense of dread, like nothing I've ever felt before. Suddenly, I felt a hit to my chest, and the next thing I knew, I was on the diner's floor next to you, Jason.""

I nodded, my stomach churning with dread. Whatever was happening, it was real, and we were in the middle of it. The carefree vibe from earlier was gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling fear that none of us could shake.

We sat there in silence for a moment, each of us processing what Eric had just said. I glanced around the diner, my eyes landing on the other patrons. The elderly couple in the corner booth had turned their heads slightly, their eyes now focused directly on us, their expressions blank.

Leah shifted uncomfortably, her eyes following mine. ""Jason... do you see that?"" she whispered. ""They're... they're staring at us.""

I nodded, my pulse quickening. ""Yeah, I see it.""

Eric looked up, his face still pale. ""What is wrong with these people?"" he muttered, his voice trembling. ""It's like they're not even real.""

The waitress, who had been standing behind the counter, suddenly moved. Her head turned towards us with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto ours. Leah gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Did you see that?""

I nodded, my throat dry. ""Yeah. Something's really wrong here.""

Eric's eyes darted to the clock on the wall. It was just past 1 a.m. ""We can't leave until 3 a.m. We literally can't leave.""

Leah's face paled as she stared at the clock. ""That's two more hours... what are we supposed to do?""

I took a deep breath. ""We stick to the rules. No more trying to test them. We just stay here, stay calm, and get through this."" My voice sounded more confident than I felt, but it was the only plan we had.

Leah nodded, her eyes still wide with fear. ""Okay... okay. But we need to keep an eye on them. Something is seriously wrong here.""

Eric looked at the patrons again, his eyes narrowing. ""They’re watching us. All of them. And I don’t think it’s just for show.""

Whatever was happening here, we were trapped, and we needed to be careful.

Feeling the oppressive eeriness of the situation, we all got up for a moment, as if movement might help break the tension. I started pacing around our booth, back and forth, my thoughts racing as I tried to make sense of everything. Leah and Eric stood close by, their eyes darting anxiously around the diner.

As I walked, my back turned to them, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder. My first thought was that it was Eric. I spun around, but when I looked towards where they had been standing, I froze. Two strangers were standing there, their faces blurry and their eyes locked directly on me. My stomach dropped as I remembered Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder. It was too late now.

The strangers stared at me. Panic surged through me, my chest tightening as I struggled to understand what was happening. Their gaze felt invasive, as if they were looking straight through me, seeing something I couldn’t comprehend.

""Leah? Eric?"" I called out again, my voice cracking, but there was no response... just the heavy silence of the diner.

The strangers took a step closer, their movements jerky, almost puppet-like. My pulse pounded in my ears. My eyes darted around the diner, catching sight of the other patrons, all of them were now staring at me, their heads turned in unison, their eyes vacant.

I freaked out. Panic clawed at my throat, and without thinking, I turned and started running through the diner. I reached the other part of the counter, my eyes wild as I scanned the room, not knowing where to run anymore. The strangers were closing in, their steps slow but relentless, like they knew I had nowhere to go.

My back hit the corner of the diner, and I slid down until I was crouched on the floor, my arms wrapped around my knees in some sort of a fetal position. My entire body trembled with terror as the lights began to flicker once more. Each flash of light revealed the strangers inching closer, their faces still blurry.

Suddenly, cold hands wrapped around my forearms, gripping me tightly. I gasped as a sharp, searing pain shot through my skin, like their fingers were burning into me. I tried to pull away, but their grip was ironclad, lifting me slightly off the ground. My vision blurred, the room spinning as the pain became unbearable, radiating up my arms like fire.

The lights flickered again, then returned to full brightness. I still felt hands on my forearms, trying to lift me up. Leah's voice broke through the haze of fear. ""Jason! Jason, it's okay. We're here. Calm down.""

I looked up, my friends' worried faces coming into focus. But the pain in my forearms was still there, a dull throb. I glanced down and saw deep red marks, finger-shaped bruises imprinted on my skin.

""It's okay,"" Leah repeated, her voice softer now. ""You're okay. We're here.""

I took a deep breath. ""They were... they were coming for me,"" I whispered.

Leah shook her head slightly, her expression growing more serious. ""Jason, there was no one there. It was just us. You... you looked like you were in some kind of trance. Then you suddenly started running, like you were terrified of something.""

Eric nodded, his eyes meeting mine with concern. ""We tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen.""

Leah's grip on my shoulders tightened. ""But you're okay now. We're going to stick together, alright?""

We slowly made our way back to the booth, settling in with a shared sense of unease. Just as I started to catch my breath, a new sound broke the silence... a muffled noise coming from the kitchen.

It was faint at first, like someone crying, the sound almost getting lost in the hum of the diner lights. Then it grew louder, more distinct... someone was crying for help.

Leah tensed beside me. ""Don't listen to it,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""It's trying to trick us. We stick to the rules.""

Eric nodded, his eyes fixed on the kitchen door, which was barely visible from our booth. ""Yeah, we can't let it get to us. It's what it wants.""

The cries grew louder, more desperate, but we held on, refusing to move. The kitchen door remained slightly ajar, and shadows seemed to dance behind it. The voice called out again, pleading, but we all sat still, determined not to be fooled.

Suddenly, I blinked, and everything changed. The booth was empty, Leah and Eric were gone. My heart dropped as I looked around, the diner now barely lit, with only a few flickering lights casting shadows across the room. The cries for help were still coming from the kitchen, but now the voice was unmistakably Leah's.

""Jason! Please, help me!"" Leah's voice echoed, filled with fear and pain. The diner was empty, every booth vacant, the air heavy and cold. The lights flickered again, making it even harder to see.

""Leah?"" I called out, my voice cracking. There was no response, only her screams growing louder, more frantic. ""Please, Jason! I'm in here!""

I took a step towards the kitchen, my mind racing. The rules said to avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if someone called for help. But Leah's voice was so real, so desperate. Each plea tore at me, making it harder to think straight.

I approached the kitchen door, the cries now almost deafening. The door was slightly open, revealing nothing but pitch darkness beyond. My hand hovered near the door handle.

""It's a trick,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's trying to trick me."" Leah's screams continued, pleading, sobbing. My entire body was shaking, my instincts screaming at me to do something.

But I didn't go inside. I couldn't. The rules were clear, and deep down, I knew this wasn't Leah... it couldn't be. I stepped back, forcing myself to look away from the darkness of the kitchen.

""I'm not falling for it,"" I muttered. The cries suddenly stopped, leaving an eerie silence that filled the diner.

I turned away from the kitchen and looked around the empty diner, hoping, praying to see Leah and Eric again.

Suddenly, I heard a faint shuffle coming from the far end of the diner, near the entrance. I turned to look. In the dim light, I saw a silhouette standing by the door. Relief washed over me as I recognized Leah's familiar frame.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the stillness. She didn't respond, but she moved towards me, her steps slow and hesitant. As she got closer, I noticed something was off. Her movements were jerky, unnatural, like she was struggling against something.

""Leah, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice trembling. She stopped a few feet away from me, her head tilted slightly as if she was listening to something I couldn't hear.

""Jason..."" she finally spoke. ""You... you have to come with me.""

My stomach twisted with unease. ""Where's Eric?"" I asked, taking a cautious step back.

""He's... waiting,"" she said, her voice flat, devoid of emotion. She reached out her hand towards me, her fingers trembling. ""Please, Jason. You have to come.""

I shook my head, my instincts screaming that something wasn't right. ""No... Leah, we need to stay here. We need to stick to the rules.""

Her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw something flicker in them... fear, desperation. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Instead, her expression twisted into one of panic, her eyes widening as if she was trying to warn me.

Suddenly, the lights flickered again, plunging the diner into darkness. When the lights returned, Leah was gone.

Panic surged through me. I spun around, searching the empty diner. ""Leah? Eric?"" I called out. There was no response.

I felt a presence... something watching me. My eyes were drawn back to the kitchen door, still slightly ajar, the darkness beyond it seeming even deeper now.

Suddenly, I heard a different sound... footsteps, coming from behind me. I turned slowly, my entire body tense, and saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Eric. He looked disheveled, his face pale, his eyes wide with fear.

""Jason,"" he whispered. ""We need to get out of here. Now.""

I hesitated, the confusion and fear swirling inside me. ""But... the rules. We can't leave until 3 a.m.""

Eric shook his head, his eyes darting around the diner. ""The rules don't matter anymore. It's changing them. It's trying to keep us here."" He grabbed my arm, his grip tight, almost painful. ""We have to go. Before it’s too late.""

The lights flickered again, and for a brief moment, I saw shadows moving across the walls, shifting and writhing as if they were alive. The diner felt like it was closing in on us, the air growing colder, the shadows creeping closer.

Eric pulled me towards the entrance, his voice urgent. ""Come on, Jason. We have to leave. Now.""

I glanced back at the kitchen door, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse.

Suddenly, everything shifted. In an instant, I was back at the booth. Leah and Eric were sitting across from me, and Leah was waving her hand in front of my face, trying to catch my attention.

""Jason, you drifted off for a few minutes. Are you okay?"" Eric asked, his voice filled with concern.

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still pounding in my chest. ""I... I don't know. It felt so real,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""I was alone in the diner, and there was Leah... calling from the kitchen. It was like I was caught in some sort of illusion."" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""This is crazy.""

Leah exchanged a worried glance with Eric. ""Jason, you were just sitting here, staring at the kitchen door.""

Eric nodded, his eyes wide. ""We tried to snap you out of it, but you were just... gone.""

I rubbed my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The fear still clung to me, the memory of the empty diner and Leah's desperate cries vivid in my mind. ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" I muttered. ""We need to be careful. Whatever this place is, it's messing with our heads.""

Leah reached across the table, taking my hand. ""We're in this together, Jason. We just have to stay focused and remember the rules. We can't let it break us.""

Eric nodded in agreement, his expression grim. ""It's trying to divide us, make us lose our grip. We just have to hold on a little longer. It's almost 3 a.m.

As the minutes dragged on, our anxiety grew. The clock on the wall ticked closer to 3 a.m., each second feeling like an eternity. Leah and Eric exchanged nervous glances, and I could feel the tension between us, the weight of the unknown pressing down on us.

Finally, the clock struck 3 a.m., the sound echoing through the empty diner. We all exhaled, a mixture of fear and relief washing over us. Leah nodded towards the front door. ""It's time. Let's get out of here.""

We stood up together, making our way towards the entrance. I pulled the door open, expecting to see the dark road outside, our way out of this nightmare. Instead, all we saw was darkness... a void, empty and endless.

""What... what is this?"" Eric muttered. The doorway led to nothing, just an infinite darkness that seemed to swallow the light from the diner.

Suddenly, a noise behind us... the strange patrons in the booths, the other patrons who had been eerily silent all night, began to move. They stood up, one by one, their movements slow, their eyes fixed on us.

Leah took a step back, her breath catching in her throat. ""They're coming...""

The patrons approached us, their faces expressionless, their footsteps echoing in the stillness of the diner. I felt a surge of panic, my instincts screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to go... the door led to nothing, and the patrons were closing in.

But then, the patrons stopped. In unison, they spoke, their voices overlapping in a haunting harmony. ""The only way to escape is to follow us.""

Leah, Eric, and I exchanged wary glances, uncertainty etched across our faces. The patrons began to move again, gesturing for us to follow them towards the back of the diner. Hesitant but desperate, we had no choice. We followed them...

They led us to a part of the diner we hadn't noticed before... a door at the back, hidden in the shadows, one that hadn't been there earlier. The patrons gestured towards it.

""Through here,"" they said in unison. ""It's the only way.""

Together, we pushed open the door, a cold breeze hitting us as it swung open. We stepped through, and suddenly, we were outside. The cold night air was like a wave of relief, the oppressive feeling from the diner finally lifting.

We turned around, but the door and the diner... were gone. All that remained was an empty road, stretching out into the darkness.

Leah let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""We made it... we're out.""

Eric nodded, his face a mix of exhaustion and relief. ""I don't know how, but we did it.""

I looked around, the memory of the diner's horrors still vivid in my mind. We were free, but I knew that night would haunt us forever.

""Come on,"" I said. ""Let's get as far away from here as we can.""

Weeks after escaping, I sat in my dorm, browsing online forums late at night. I came across a post titled ""The Vanishing Diner - Have You Seen It?"". I read accounts eerily similar to our own. The Last Stop Café... people claimed it had been appearing and disappearing across different states for decades. The descriptions were identical: detours that shouldn't exist, strange rules in the menus, and patrons with blurry faces.

As I read further, I stumbled upon posts from people searching desperately for loved ones who vanished after visiting diners just like this one. The eerie part? The missing individuals matched the descriptions of people we saw that night. A chill ran through me as I realized we might have been witnessing people who were already lost to the diner, trapped in some twisted limbo.

1pzd6hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1pzd6hz/we_took_a_detour_and_found_a_diner_that_shouldnt/,We Took a Detour and Found a Diner That Shouldn’t Exist,"We called it the trip of the year, a chance to break free from the suffocating grind of college life, an impulsive decision born over too many late-night study sessions and caffeine highs. Our destination was supposed to be an adventure, a cabin in the mountains where we could forget about exams and papers, at least for a weekend. But what we got was something else entirely.

The three of us had always been close, each of us playing a part in our peculiar little trio. There was me, Jason, the designated driver and unofficial planner. I liked to think of myself as the one who kept us grounded, the one who knew how to read a map or change a tire when things went wrong.

The others liked to joke that I was born thirty years too late, that my knack for analog solutions and my mistrust of GPS meant I was more suited to road trips of the '80s than the tech-filled caravans of today.

Then there was Leah. Leah was the spark, the reason this trip existed in the first place. She was always the one with the ideas, the kind that started with “Wouldn’t it be crazy if…?” and ended up with us sneaking into the campus library after hours or setting out at midnight for a spontaneous drive to the coast.

Leah had a wild spirit, the type that made you believe anything could be fun as long as she was around. She was impulsive, unpredictable, and exactly the kind of person you wanted next to you when life started feeling too routine.

And finally, there was Eric. Eric was the quiet one, thoughtful, skeptical, but always game once Leah managed to convince him. He was the kind of guy who preferred stability over chaos but found himself often choosing chaos simply because Leah and I were his friends.

He kept a book in his backpack at all times, claiming you never knew when you might get a chance to read. Leah teased him about it endlessly, but deep down, we both knew that Eric’s bookish demeanor kept us from wandering too far into dangerous territory, at least most of the time.

The trip had started out smooth enough. The plan was simple: leave campus Friday afternoon, drive for a few hours, and reach the cabin by nightfall. We were armed with snacks, a playlist Leah had curated called “Songs for Escaping Reality,” and Eric’s stack of travel guides and trail maps.

“I swear, this playlist is going to change your life,” Leah said, grinning as she cranked up the volume. The first notes of a classic rock song blared through the speakers, and she started nodding her head to the beat.

Eric rolled his eyes, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Yeah, yeah, until you play that one weird techno track that you always sneak in.”

“Oh, come on! It’s all part of the experience,” Leah shot back, winking at me in the rearview mirror.

“As long as it keeps us awake,” I said, keeping my eyes on the road. The sky was blushing with the colors of sunset as we left behind the sprawling cityscape and ventured into the countryside.

Everything was perfect until it wasn’t. A detour sign appeared on the road where none should have been, and our GPS lost its signal somewhere in the rolling hills.

""Uh, that's weird. Was this detour here last time?"" I asked, frowning as I slowed down.

Leah leaned forward, squinting at the sign. ""Who cares? It’s an adventure, right? Besides, what's the worst that could happen?"" She flashed a grin, her enthusiasm infectious as always.

Eric, sitting in the back, sighed. ""I don't know, guys. Detours that aren't on maps tend to end up in horror movies,"" he said, but there was a hint of a smile on his face.

""Oh, come on, Eric. Don’t be such a buzzkill,"" Leah teased. ""I promise, if we end up in a horror movie, I’ll save you first.""

""That’s reassuring,"" Eric replied, rolling his eyes.

We weren’t worried, not at first. I had maps, after all, and Leah had a sixth sense for adventure. We laughed about it, teasing each other as the sun dipped lower, the horizon melting into a deep, inky blue. The mood was light, Leah making jokes about the ""mystery road"" and Eric reluctantly joining in.

""Maybe we'll find buried treasure,"" Leah said, her voice tinged with excitement.

""Or a cult,"" Eric added, shaking his head. ""Hopefully not a cult.""

We passed fields and forests, the headlights cutting through an increasingly lonely road, the kind where you started to forget you were even part of the world anymore.

It was Leah who first pointed it out... the flickering neon sign glowing faintly in the distance.

“The Last Stop Café,” it read, in faded letters.

Leah was thrilled, immediately insisting we pull over. She called it a “classic roadside experience,” her enthusiasm spilling over into her voice as she spoke of milkshakes and greasy fries served in places just like this.

Eric sighed, a small reluctant smile tugging at his lips as he nodded. “Might as well. We’re lost anyway,” he muttered, glancing at me.

I hesitated.

“Come on, Jason, where’s your sense of adventure?” Leah’s voice broke through my thoughts. She leaned in, her eyes sparkling. “I bet they have the best milkshakes.”

“Yeah, the kind with extra mystery ingredients,” Eric said drily, but he was already unbuckling his seatbelt.

The gravel crunched beneath the tires as we pulled into the lot, the diner standing solitary under the night sky, its windows glowing an eerie yellow. The place seemed oddly empty.

“Anyone else getting a weird vibe from this place?” I asked, trying to keep my tone light.

Leah laughed, already halfway out of the car. “You always think too much, Jason. It’s just a diner!”

Eric shrugged. “Let’s just grab something to eat. It’s probably fine.” He paused, looking at the darkened road behind us. “Though it is kind of… isolated.”

“But that’s what makes it an adventure!” Leah declared, stretching her arms. She turned to me with a grin. “Besides, I’m starving. Let’s go!”

I followed them toward the entrance. The door creaked open and we stepped inside. The diner was small, with red vinyl booths and a long counter lined with chrome stools. A lone waitress stood behind the counter, giving us a polite smile.

""Welcome in, folks,"" she said, her voice warm. ""Sit wherever you'd like.""

Leah immediately pointed to a booth near the window. ""That one! It’s got the best view,"" she said, practically bouncing over to it.

Eric and I followed, settling into the booth. I couldn’t help but notice how empty the diner was, just us and a few other patrons who seemed lost in their own world.

As I looked closer, I noticed the other patrons more carefully. There was a man sitting alone at the counter, staring into a cup of coffee.

In the corner booth, an elderly couple sat side by side, neither of them speaking. The woman was looking out the window, her expression blank, while the man seemed to be fixated on a spot on the table, his lips moving as if he were muttering something under his breath.

Eric followed my gaze and raised an eyebrow. ""Not exactly the liveliest bunch, huh?""

Leah shrugged. ""Hey, it’s late. People are tired. Besides, it’s kind of nice to have the place mostly to ourselves.""

The waitress approached our table. She handed us the menus without a word, her demeanor far less welcoming than before, and left without waiting for a response.

Leah opened her menu first, her eyes widening. ""Whoa, guys, check this out. There are actual rules in here. Like... rules for eating at a diner?""

""Rules?"" Eric asked, raising an eyebrow as he flipped open his menu. ""What kind of rules?""

I glanced at my own menu, noticing a laminated page right at the front titled 'House Rules'. Leah cleared her throat dramatically and began reading aloud.

""Rule 1: Do not ask the staff about the diner's history,"" she said, pausing for effect. ""Oh no, we can’t talk about the mysterious past of the creepy diner. What a shame.""

Eric snorted. ""Yeah, right. Like anyone actually cares about that.""

Leah continued, her voice dripping with playful sarcasm. ""Rule 2: Do not enter the restroom alone. Well, I guess I'm on my own if I need to go. Thanks for nothing, guys.""

I chuckled. ""Maybe they’re just really big on safety. Or maybe they just don't want anyone wandering off and getting lost in their haunted bathroom.""

""Rule 3: If the neon sign outside flickers, close your eyes until it stops,"" Leah read, her eyebrows shooting up. ""Close your eyes? Are they worried about seizures or something?""

""Rule 4: Avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if you hear someone calling for help,"" I read aloud, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, that’s oddly specific.""

Leah grinned. ""Maybe they just don't want us to steal their secret recipes.""

""Or maybe it's where they keep the bodies,"" Eric added, his tone deadpan.

""Rule 5: If someone sits in the booth across from you with a blurry face, do not speak to them,"" I read aloud, glancing at Leah and Eric. ""Blurry face? What does that even mean?""

Eric laughed. ""Maybe they just don’t want us talking to strangers.""

""Rule 6: If the power goes out, stay seated and do not speak until the lights return,"" Leah read, her smile fading slightly. ""Okay, that one’s just creepy.""

""Probably just a gimmick to make the place seem spooky,"" I said, trying to keep the mood light.

Leah nodded, then read the next one. ""Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder.""

""Rule 8: Do not answer if your name is called by someone you don’t recognize,"" Eric read, his voice taking on a mock-serious tone. ""I guess no new friends for us tonight.""

""No complaints here,"" I said, chuckling.

Eric flipped to the next rule. ""Rule 9: Do not look under the table for any reason.""

""Okay, now they’re just messing with us,"" he said, shaking his head.

I took a deep breath before reading the last rule. ""And finally, Rule 10: Under no circumstances should you leave the diner before 3:00 a.m.""

""I guess we’re stuck here for a while,"" I said, attempting to lighten the mood but failing to hide the unease. ""Hope they really do have good milkshakes.""

Leah waved her hand dismissively, her grin still intact. ""Oh, come on, Jason. It's just a cool marketing gimmick. You know, like, come for the creepy rules, stay for the food.""

Eric nodded, though he seemed to notice my tone. ""Yeah, it’s definitely giving off haunted attraction vibes. They probably get a lot of late-night thrill-seekers in here. I just hope the food lives up to the hype.""

We turned our attention back to the menus, scanning through the classic diner options. Leah tapped her finger against the table, deciding between a burger and a milkshake. ""I think I'll go for the double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. You can't go wrong with the classics, right?""

""I'm getting the pancakes,"" Eric said. ""Breakfast for dinner never disappoints.""

""I guess I'll go with the burger, too. And maybe some fries to share,"" I added.

The waitress approached again, her demeanor just as cold as before. She pulled out her notepad and asked, ""Ready to order?""

Leah smiled up at her. ""Yeah, I'll take the double cheeseburger with a chocolate milkshake.""

Eric nodded. ""Pancakes for me, please. And a coffee.""

""Burger and fries, and a coffee for me,"" I said.

The waitress scribbled down our orders without a word, her eyes barely meeting ours. As she turned to leave, Leah spoke up, her tone playful. ""So, about these rules... Are they just for fun, or do you actually have people trying to break them?""

The waitress paused, her back still to us. Slowly, she turned, her expression more serious than ever. ""The rules are there for a reason,"" she said, her voice cold and unwavering. ""You should follow them. Every one of them.""

Leah laughed, clearly amused. ""Wow, you're really committed to the bit. It definitely keeps the creepy vibe alive.""

Eric nodded in agreement. ""Yeah, it adds to the atmosphere. Very immersive.""

The waitress didn't respond. She simply turned and walked away, her footsteps echoing again in the empty diner. I couldn't help myself. I called after her, a smirk on my face. ""Hey, what about the history of this place? Any ghost stories we should know about?""

The waitress froze mid-step. Her body stiffened, and she turned her head slightly, just enough for me to catch a glimpse of her eyes... wide, almost terrified.

Suddenly, the lights in the diner flickered, dimming until they cast only the faintest glow. The air grew heavy, and a cold shiver ran down my spine as I felt it... a presence, a sensation of someone breathing down my neck.

The laughter from Leah and Eric seemed to fade, and suddenly, I realized the diner was silent, too silent. My eyes darted around, and to my growing horror, I saw that Leah and Eric were no longer there.

The booth across from me was empty, as if they had never been there at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I slowly turned my head, feeling the intense pressure of something right behind me.

I turned fully. Inches away from my face was a figure, a blurry, pale face staring straight at me, its eyes wide and hollow. It was there for just a split second, but it was enough to send a jolt of fear through me. I gasped and jerked back instinctively, my body colliding with the table. I lost my balance, falling hard onto the floor, the sound of the crash echoing in the empty diner.

Suddenly, the lights flickered back to full brightness, and Leah and Eric's laughter filled the air again, as if nothing had happened.

""Nice one, Jason,"" Leah said, still grinning. ""Really going all in on the creepy vibe, huh?""

Eric chuckled, shaking his head. ""Bravo! I like how you're getting into character. Keeps things interesting.""

I forced a smile, but my eyes darted around the diner. Something had happened, something real. I could still feel the lingering coldness, and a sense of wrongness gnawed at me. I leaned forward, lowering my voice. ""Guys, I'm serious. There was something behind me. I felt it. The lights, everything just went... off.""

Leah rolled her eyes, still grinning. ""Oh, come on, Jason. Don't try to freak us out now. You're just adding to the atmosphere, right?""

Eric shook his head, his smile not quite fading. ""Yeah, man. I gotta admit, you're doing a good job keeping the creepy vibe alive. But seriously, relax.""

I opened my mouth to argue, but Leah nudged me playfully. ""Bravo on the acting, by the way. Really sold it. Now let's just enjoy our food when it gets here.""

I tried to shake off the feeling, but the cold dread settled deep in my chest, refusing to leave. It felt like something had changed, and I couldn't quite put it out of my mind.

A few moments later, the waitress returned, balancing a tray with our orders. She set down Leah's cheeseburger and milkshake, Eric's pancakes, and my burger and fries. The food looked surprisingly good, steam rising from the plates, and for a moment, I almost forgot the strange encounter.

""Finally! I'm starving,"" Leah said, rubbing her hands together before diving into her burger.

""Pancakes look decent,"" Eric added, pouring syrup over them. ""Not bad for a creepy diner in the middle of nowhere.""

I nodded, though my appetite had waned. I took a bite of my burger, the taste barely registering as I kept glancing around, my eyes flicking to the other patrons and the shadows in the corners of the room.

""What's up, Jason?"" Leah asked through a mouthful of fries. ""You still on edge?""

I hesitated, then spoke. ""I can't shake it, Leah. When the lights went out... I swear, there was something behind me. I saw a face. It was inches away.""

Leah and Eric exchanged uneasy glances. Leah's smile faltered for a moment. ""Jason, seriously, enough. You're really starting to freak me out now.""

Eric set his coffee down, frowning slightly. ""Yeah, man. If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Just... stop, okay?""

I forced a smile, trying to brush off their reaction. ""I'm not joking, guys. It felt real.""

Leah shook her head, her expression torn between amusement and discomfort. ""Okay, well, can we just drop it? Let's try to enjoy the food.""

Eric nodded, his gaze shifting to his pancakes. ""Yeah, let's just move on. This place is creepy enough without us making it worse.""

We ate quietly for a while, and surprisingly, the food was actually really good. Leah was halfway through her cheeseburger, her earlier unease replaced by her usual enthusiasm. ""I have to admit, this is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time,"" she said, her voice cheerful again.

Eric nodded, his pancakes already half gone. ""Yeah, pretty solid""

I tried to relax, taking a bite of my burger. It was juicy and flavorful, and the fries were perfectly crispy.

Leah wiped her hands on a napkin and then got up, glancing towards the back of the diner. ""Alright, I hate to say it, but I need to break one of those scary rules,"" she said with a chuckle. ""Restroom time. Guess I'm going solo.""

Eric gave her a look, half-amused, half-concerned. ""You sure about that, Leah?""

She laughed, waving him off. ""What, you think I'm going to get sucked into the haunted bathroom? I'll be fine. Just keep my milkshake safe.""

I watched as Leah made her way towards the restrooms, her confidence unwavering. But something in my gut twisted with unease, and I found myself unable to look away until she disappeared behind the restroom door.

A few moments passed, and I tried to distract myself, picking at my fries. Eric was scrolling through his phone, oblivious to my anxiety. The diner felt quiet, the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead suddenly grating.

Then, a scream pierced the air. My head snapped up, and I saw Eric's eyes widen as he turned towards the restrooms. Without thinking, I jumped up from the booth, my heart pounding as I rushed to the restroom door. I slammed it open, the door crashing against the wall.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the small, tiled space.

Leah was on the floor, her hands covering her face. She was trembling. I kneeled down next to her, my hands hovering just above her shoulders. ""Leah, it's okay. I'm here. What happened?""

She shook her head, her voice barely audible. ""There's... there's something in the stall. I saw it.""

I glanced towards the stall she was pointing at, my stomach churning. Carefully, I stood up and moved towards it, each step feeling heavier than the last. I reached out, hesitating for a moment before pushing the stall door open.

It swung wide, revealing nothing but an empty stall. I turned back to Leah, her eyes wide with fear as she stared at me, trying to get a glimpse inside.

""There's nothing here, Leah,"" I said gently, trying to keep my voice calm. ""It's empty.""

She shook her head again. ""No... no, I swear, Jason. There was something. It was there.""

I helped her to her feet, her hands still trembling as she clung to my arm. We walked back to the table, Leah leaning heavily against me. Eric stood up as we approached, his expression a mix of concern and confusion.

""What happened?"" he asked, his eyes darting between us.

Leah sank into the booth, her face still pale. ""There was something in the stall, Eric. It... it was crawling towards me.""

Eric frowned, shaking his head. ""Leah, come on. Jason already freaked me out earlier. If you're trying to do the same thing...""

""No!"" Leah snapped, her voice trembling. ""This isn't a joke. There's something weird going on here. It's not just a marketing scheme.""

I nodded, my eyes meeting Eric's. ""She's right. Something's off about this place. We need to take this seriously.""

Eric hesitated, the doubt still evident on his face. ""Alright, fine. But... what exactly did you see, Leah?""

Leah took a deep breath, her eyes still wide with fear. ""It had four legs, like... like an animal, but no head or body. Just legs. And it started moving towards me from the stall. I screamed, and then Jason came.""

Eric stared at her for a moment, his expression shifting from confusion to discomfort.

He sighed, rubbing his temples. ""Okay, enough. This is getting way too weird, guys. I don't know if I believe it, but... it's really starting to freak me out. Can we just stop and try to chill for a bit? I need some air. I'm going outside."" Eric pushed himself up from the booth, grabbing his jacket. He shook his head, his expression a mix of skepticism and unease. ""I don't care about the rules or whatever is supposed to happen here. I just need a cigarette.""

""Eric, wait,"" I said, my voice urgent. ""You can't just go outside. The rules...""

""Forget the rules, Jason,"" Eric snapped, his frustration clear. ""I'm not staying in here. It's too much."" He turned and headed towards the entrance, not waiting for Leah or me to respond.

Eric reached the entrance door, pushing it open, but as he stepped halfway through, he froze... literally frozen mid-step, his body rigid between the diner and the outside. His hand still held the door, and his whole form seemed almost like a mannequin stuck in motion.

""Eric?"" Leah called out, her voice shaky. ""What are you doing?""

I stood up, my heart pounding. ""Eric, come on, man. Stop messing around."" But there was no response, he was utterly still. Leah and I exchanged a nervous glance, both of us unsure of what to do.

""Is he... okay?"" Leah whispered, her eyes wide with fear.

I shook my head, slowly stepping away from the booth. ""I... I don't know. He looks like he's stuck."" I moved closer, my eyes darting around the diner. The other patrons were no longer lost in their own worlds; instead, they were staring at Eric, their eyes unblinking, their heads fixed.

""Leah... they're all staring at him,"" I muttered. She turned her head, her breath catching in her throat as she noticed the other patrons' fixed gazes.

I moved cautiously towards Eric. Just as I was within arm's reach of Eric, his body jerked violently, as if some unseen force had pushed him back. He flew into the diner, crashing onto his back and sliding several feet across the floor.

""Eric!"" I shouted, rushing to his side. He was gasping for breath, his face pale and his eyes wide with terror. I grabbed his arm, helping him sit up. ""What happened? Are you okay?""

Eric's eyes darted around wildly before locking onto mine. His voice was shaky. ""They're there... outside. They're there!""

I glanced towards the open door, but all I could see was darkness beyond. I helped Eric to his feet, and together we made our way back to the booth, Leah's face stricken with fear as she watched us approach.

""What the hell happened?"" Leah asked, her voice trembling.

Eric collapsed into the booth, his hands shaking. He took a moment to gather his breath, then began speaking. ""I stepped outside, okay? I needed air. I moved around the side of the diner and lit a cigarette.""

Leah's eyes widened, and she interrupted. ""Eric, no, you didn't. You were just in the doorway. You were frozen there.""

We all exchanged glances, both terrified and confused. Eric shook his head, bewildered. ""No, I swear I stepped outside. I was out there. While I was having my cigarette, I started hearing something calling me from just around the diner. I went to the corner and peeked around it, but there was nothing.""

He paused, his eyes darting between us as he continued, his voice trembling. ""I looked closer and started noticing movement in the dark. It was like... a face, detached from anything, just staring at me. Then the darkness seemed to get even thicker, like it swallowed everything else.""

Eric's voice dropped to a whisper. ""I turned back towards the entrance of the diner, but it was dark there too... pitch black, like nothing was there. And then I heard it... this shushing noise, closing in on me. I can't explain it, but it was like something was surrounding me. I felt this sense of dread, like nothing I've ever felt before. Suddenly, I felt a hit to my chest, and the next thing I knew, I was on the diner's floor next to you, Jason.""

I nodded, my stomach churning with dread. Whatever was happening, it was real, and we were in the middle of it. The carefree vibe from earlier was gone, replaced by a deep, unsettling fear that none of us could shake.

We sat there in silence for a moment, each of us processing what Eric had just said. I glanced around the diner, my eyes landing on the other patrons. The elderly couple in the corner booth had turned their heads slightly, their eyes now focused directly on us, their expressions blank.

Leah shifted uncomfortably, her eyes following mine. ""Jason... do you see that?"" she whispered. ""They're... they're staring at us.""

I nodded, my pulse quickening. ""Yeah, I see it.""

Eric looked up, his face still pale. ""What is wrong with these people?"" he muttered, his voice trembling. ""It's like they're not even real.""

The waitress, who had been standing behind the counter, suddenly moved. Her head turned towards us with an unnatural jerk, her eyes locking onto ours. Leah gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. ""Did you see that?""

I nodded, my throat dry. ""Yeah. Something's really wrong here.""

Eric's eyes darted to the clock on the wall. It was just past 1 a.m. ""We can't leave until 3 a.m. We literally can't leave.""

Leah's face paled as she stared at the clock. ""That's two more hours... what are we supposed to do?""

I took a deep breath. ""We stick to the rules. No more trying to test them. We just stay here, stay calm, and get through this."" My voice sounded more confident than I felt, but it was the only plan we had.

Leah nodded, her eyes still wide with fear. ""Okay... okay. But we need to keep an eye on them. Something is seriously wrong here.""

Eric looked at the patrons again, his eyes narrowing. ""They’re watching us. All of them. And I don’t think it’s just for show.""

Whatever was happening here, we were trapped, and we needed to be careful.

Feeling the oppressive eeriness of the situation, we all got up for a moment, as if movement might help break the tension. I started pacing around our booth, back and forth, my thoughts racing as I tried to make sense of everything. Leah and Eric stood close by, their eyes darting anxiously around the diner.

As I walked, my back turned to them, I suddenly felt a light tap on my shoulder. My first thought was that it was Eric. I spun around, but when I looked towards where they had been standing, I froze. Two strangers were standing there, their faces blurry and their eyes locked directly on me. My stomach dropped as I remembered Rule 7: Never turn around if someone taps you on the shoulder. It was too late now.

The strangers stared at me. Panic surged through me, my chest tightening as I struggled to understand what was happening. Their gaze felt invasive, as if they were looking straight through me, seeing something I couldn’t comprehend.

""Leah? Eric?"" I called out again, my voice cracking, but there was no response... just the heavy silence of the diner.

The strangers took a step closer, their movements jerky, almost puppet-like. My pulse pounded in my ears. My eyes darted around the diner, catching sight of the other patrons, all of them were now staring at me, their heads turned in unison, their eyes vacant.

I freaked out. Panic clawed at my throat, and without thinking, I turned and started running through the diner. I reached the other part of the counter, my eyes wild as I scanned the room, not knowing where to run anymore. The strangers were closing in, their steps slow but relentless, like they knew I had nowhere to go.

My back hit the corner of the diner, and I slid down until I was crouched on the floor, my arms wrapped around my knees in some sort of a fetal position. My entire body trembled with terror as the lights began to flicker once more. Each flash of light revealed the strangers inching closer, their faces still blurry.

Suddenly, cold hands wrapped around my forearms, gripping me tightly. I gasped as a sharp, searing pain shot through my skin, like their fingers were burning into me. I tried to pull away, but their grip was ironclad, lifting me slightly off the ground. My vision blurred, the room spinning as the pain became unbearable, radiating up my arms like fire.

The lights flickered again, then returned to full brightness. I still felt hands on my forearms, trying to lift me up. Leah's voice broke through the haze of fear. ""Jason! Jason, it's okay. We're here. Calm down.""

I looked up, my friends' worried faces coming into focus. But the pain in my forearms was still there, a dull throb. I glanced down and saw deep red marks, finger-shaped bruises imprinted on my skin.

""It's okay,"" Leah repeated, her voice softer now. ""You're okay. We're here.""

I took a deep breath. ""They were... they were coming for me,"" I whispered.

Leah shook her head slightly, her expression growing more serious. ""Jason, there was no one there. It was just us. You... you looked like you were in some kind of trance. Then you suddenly started running, like you were terrified of something.""

Eric nodded, his eyes meeting mine with concern. ""We tried to stop you, but you wouldn't listen.""

Leah's grip on my shoulders tightened. ""But you're okay now. We're going to stick together, alright?""

We slowly made our way back to the booth, settling in with a shared sense of unease. Just as I started to catch my breath, a new sound broke the silence... a muffled noise coming from the kitchen.

It was faint at first, like someone crying, the sound almost getting lost in the hum of the diner lights. Then it grew louder, more distinct... someone was crying for help.

Leah tensed beside me. ""Don't listen to it,"" she whispered, her voice trembling. ""It's trying to trick us. We stick to the rules.""

Eric nodded, his eyes fixed on the kitchen door, which was barely visible from our booth. ""Yeah, we can't let it get to us. It's what it wants.""

The cries grew louder, more desperate, but we held on, refusing to move. The kitchen door remained slightly ajar, and shadows seemed to dance behind it. The voice called out again, pleading, but we all sat still, determined not to be fooled.

Suddenly, I blinked, and everything changed. The booth was empty, Leah and Eric were gone. My heart dropped as I looked around, the diner now barely lit, with only a few flickering lights casting shadows across the room. The cries for help were still coming from the kitchen, but now the voice was unmistakably Leah's.

""Jason! Please, help me!"" Leah's voice echoed, filled with fear and pain. The diner was empty, every booth vacant, the air heavy and cold. The lights flickered again, making it even harder to see.

""Leah?"" I called out, my voice cracking. There was no response, only her screams growing louder, more frantic. ""Please, Jason! I'm in here!""

I took a step towards the kitchen, my mind racing. The rules said to avoid the kitchen at all costs, even if someone called for help. But Leah's voice was so real, so desperate. Each plea tore at me, making it harder to think straight.

I approached the kitchen door, the cries now almost deafening. The door was slightly open, revealing nothing but pitch darkness beyond. My hand hovered near the door handle.

""It's a trick,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's trying to trick me."" Leah's screams continued, pleading, sobbing. My entire body was shaking, my instincts screaming at me to do something.

But I didn't go inside. I couldn't. The rules were clear, and deep down, I knew this wasn't Leah... it couldn't be. I stepped back, forcing myself to look away from the darkness of the kitchen.

""I'm not falling for it,"" I muttered. The cries suddenly stopped, leaving an eerie silence that filled the diner.

I turned away from the kitchen and looked around the empty diner, hoping, praying to see Leah and Eric again.

Suddenly, I heard a faint shuffle coming from the far end of the diner, near the entrance. I turned to look. In the dim light, I saw a silhouette standing by the door. Relief washed over me as I recognized Leah's familiar frame.

""Leah!"" I called out, my voice echoing in the stillness. She didn't respond, but she moved towards me, her steps slow and hesitant. As she got closer, I noticed something was off. Her movements were jerky, unnatural, like she was struggling against something.

""Leah, are you okay?"" I asked, my voice trembling. She stopped a few feet away from me, her head tilted slightly as if she was listening to something I couldn't hear.

""Jason..."" she finally spoke. ""You... you have to come with me.""

My stomach twisted with unease. ""Where's Eric?"" I asked, taking a cautious step back.

""He's... waiting,"" she said, her voice flat, devoid of emotion. She reached out her hand towards me, her fingers trembling. ""Please, Jason. You have to come.""

I shook my head, my instincts screaming that something wasn't right. ""No... Leah, we need to stay here. We need to stick to the rules.""

Her eyes locked onto mine, and for a moment, I saw something flicker in them... fear, desperation. She opened her mouth to say something, but no words came out. Instead, her expression twisted into one of panic, her eyes widening as if she was trying to warn me.

Suddenly, the lights flickered again, plunging the diner into darkness. When the lights returned, Leah was gone.

Panic surged through me. I spun around, searching the empty diner. ""Leah? Eric?"" I called out. There was no response.

I felt a presence... something watching me. My eyes were drawn back to the kitchen door, still slightly ajar, the darkness beyond it seeming even deeper now.

Suddenly, I heard a different sound... footsteps, coming from behind me. I turned slowly, my entire body tense, and saw a figure emerging from the shadows. It was Eric. He looked disheveled, his face pale, his eyes wide with fear.

""Jason,"" he whispered. ""We need to get out of here. Now.""

I hesitated, the confusion and fear swirling inside me. ""But... the rules. We can't leave until 3 a.m.""

Eric shook his head, his eyes darting around the diner. ""The rules don't matter anymore. It's changing them. It's trying to keep us here."" He grabbed my arm, his grip tight, almost painful. ""We have to go. Before it’s too late.""

The lights flickered again, and for a brief moment, I saw shadows moving across the walls, shifting and writhing as if they were alive. The diner felt like it was closing in on us, the air growing colder, the shadows creeping closer.

Eric pulled me towards the entrance, his voice urgent. ""Come on, Jason. We have to leave. Now.""

I glanced back at the kitchen door, the darkness beyond it seeming to pulse.

Suddenly, everything shifted. In an instant, I was back at the booth. Leah and Eric were sitting across from me, and Leah was waving her hand in front of my face, trying to catch my attention.

""Jason, you drifted off for a few minutes. Are you okay?"" Eric asked, his voice filled with concern.

I blinked, disoriented, my heart still pounding in my chest. ""I... I don't know. It felt so real,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""I was alone in the diner, and there was Leah... calling from the kitchen. It was like I was caught in some sort of illusion."" I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. ""This is crazy.""

Leah exchanged a worried glance with Eric. ""Jason, you were just sitting here, staring at the kitchen door.""

Eric nodded, his eyes wide. ""We tried to snap you out of it, but you were just... gone.""

I rubbed my temples, trying to make sense of it all. The fear still clung to me, the memory of the empty diner and Leah's desperate cries vivid in my mind. ""I don't know what's real anymore,"" I muttered. ""We need to be careful. Whatever this place is, it's messing with our heads.""

Leah reached across the table, taking my hand. ""We're in this together, Jason. We just have to stay focused and remember the rules. We can't let it break us.""

Eric nodded in agreement, his expression grim. ""It's trying to divide us, make us lose our grip. We just have to hold on a little longer. It's almost 3 a.m.

As the minutes dragged on, our anxiety grew. The clock on the wall ticked closer to 3 a.m., each second feeling like an eternity. Leah and Eric exchanged nervous glances, and I could feel the tension between us, the weight of the unknown pressing down on us.

Finally, the clock struck 3 a.m., the sound echoing through the empty diner. We all exhaled, a mixture of fear and relief washing over us. Leah nodded towards the front door. ""It's time. Let's get out of here.""

We stood up together, making our way towards the entrance. I pulled the door open, expecting to see the dark road outside, our way out of this nightmare. Instead, all we saw was darkness... a void, empty and endless.

""What... what is this?"" Eric muttered. The doorway led to nothing, just an infinite darkness that seemed to swallow the light from the diner.

Suddenly, a noise behind us... the strange patrons in the booths, the other patrons who had been eerily silent all night, began to move. They stood up, one by one, their movements slow, their eyes fixed on us.

Leah took a step back, her breath catching in her throat. ""They're coming...""

The patrons approached us, their faces expressionless, their footsteps echoing in the stillness of the diner. I felt a surge of panic, my instincts screaming at me to run, but there was nowhere to go... the door led to nothing, and the patrons were closing in.

But then, the patrons stopped. In unison, they spoke, their voices overlapping in a haunting harmony. ""The only way to escape is to follow us.""

Leah, Eric, and I exchanged wary glances, uncertainty etched across our faces. The patrons began to move again, gesturing for us to follow them towards the back of the diner. Hesitant but desperate, we had no choice. We followed them...

They led us to a part of the diner we hadn't noticed before... a door at the back, hidden in the shadows, one that hadn't been there earlier. The patrons gestured towards it.

""Through here,"" they said in unison. ""It's the only way.""

Together, we pushed open the door, a cold breeze hitting us as it swung open. We stepped through, and suddenly, we were outside. The cold night air was like a wave of relief, the oppressive feeling from the diner finally lifting.

We turned around, but the door and the diner... were gone. All that remained was an empty road, stretching out into the darkness.

Leah let out a shaky breath, her eyes wide with disbelief. ""We made it... we're out.""

Eric nodded, his face a mix of exhaustion and relief. ""I don't know how, but we did it.""

I looked around, the memory of the diner's horrors still vivid in my mind. We were free, but I knew that night would haunt us forever.

""Come on,"" I said. ""Let's get as far away from here as we can.""

Weeks after escaping, I sat in my dorm, browsing online forums late at night. I came across a post titled ""The Vanishing Diner - Have You Seen It?"". I read accounts eerily similar to our own. The Last Stop Café... people claimed it had been appearing and disappearing across different states for decades. The descriptions were identical: detours that shouldn't exist, strange rules in the menus, and patrons with blurry faces.

As I read further, I stumbled upon posts from people searching desperately for loved ones who vanished after visiting diners just like this one. The eerie part? The missing individuals matched the descriptions of people we saw that night. A chill ran through me as I realized we might have been witnessing people who were already lost to the diner, trapped in some twisted limbo.

The realization left me cold, we might have become just another entry in those threads.

So, if you ever find yourself on a detour and see The Last Stop Café, just keep [driving.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepyStoriesArchive/)",1,1767084694.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

1pzd499,https://www.reddit.com/r/cfs/comments/1pzd499/a_lifetime_of_unexplained_fatigue_only_in_my_50s/,A lifetime of unexplained fatigue. Only in my 50s did I realise it was CFS.,"I want to share my experience of living with mild CFS. 

As a school boy, I first felt fatigue even while talking. My friends could talk for hours, study, play and run errands. I would get tired after an hour of casual conversation. One trip to the market would end my morning or evening. My father tired fast too, so I assumed I was like him. He once told me, “We are people with less nervous energy. Just accept it.”

Continuous cold and sinus trouble added to this. Till 35, I avoided exercise because of sneezing and headaches. Since I wanted to study and take a degree, friendships became the first casualty. I withdrew from social life. “I cannot meet you… I cannot attend this wedding or party.” I preserved my energy by being alone, attending college and rushing home to study. Even this gave me pain in the feet, a tired body and a back ache. I spoke to only one person. Other friends became telephonic friends. The only benefit of this automatic adjustment was academic: I completed my postgraduate degree with an A grade. I needed thrice the effort others needed, even when they had hobbies and extra‑curriculars. I had none. Life stayed this way till I became a professional at 25.

I began working at the prime of youth, but could work for only four hours after a forty‑five‑minute commute. Breathlessness, red eyes, yawning, body ache and muscle fatigue followed. People made fun of me for stretching at my desk and yawning in meetings. This was the late 1990s. I had not heard of CFS. I blamed myself: laziness, lack of workouts, persistent sinus, unhealthy food. Strangely, my workplace image was the opposite. People saw an introverted, focused finisher who completed work before deadlines. Few noticed that I sacrificed fun, socialising, outings and dating. In spite of a tired body, I became known as a punctual, reliable worker. I turned my weakness into a strength.

A huge opportunity came later. I got admission to one of the top American universities in the world. I had a chance to pursue a PhD. I went, but my condition made coping impossible. I completed a Master’s with an A grade and decided against the PhD because it required studying and working together, something I could not do. I returned to my job with a new realisation: something was wrong with me. By then, sleep irregularity had begun. I fell asleep quickly but only for four hours, and then struggled to sleep again.

My attempts to manage these symptoms began with regular workouts. I started at 37, and today I am 53. Exercise helped a little but not much. Protein, B12 and iron helped initially, then stopped helping. Fatigue, red eyes, yawning and lack of vigour returned. I coped by sacrificing social life, outings and movement. People joked again: after office work, he goes home and stays inside four walls. I could not take extra assignments to earn more. Many times, people postponed meetings because I looked tired, yawned and had red eyes even at 11 am. They noticed swollen eyes and a puffed‑up face. (I do not drink alcohol.)

Meanwhile, even with limited income, I got married and had two children. I bought a house and a car. I studied further and achieved some small things, but nothing unusual. Many people say my life is wasted because I am not hardworking or because I lack social connections. All this comes from the choices I made to manage my energy.

What all I tried: black coffee, protein supplements, other supplements. No effect. Steroid shots gave about ten percent improvement in joint aches. But the biggest adjustment was sacrificing social life and extra work. I stick to basic routine, essential professional and family tasks, and finish them quickly before fatigue sets in.

For the last year, homeopathic treatment has helped me somewhat, but the effect is erratic. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not. I do not know what the medicines are. The doctor keeps trying different ones.

Mine is a mild case of CFS, managed through sacrifices in social life, professional growth and financial gains. For the wider world, I remain a lazy underachiever who avoids risks, avoids stretching himself and avoids challenging tasks.

I feel bad for my family. They want me to laugh loudly, talk to people, stay awake for late‑night shows and travel to enjoy life. But that has not happened, and will not happen. They bear with me. “You go inside and rest. Do not worry. We will enjoy ourselves.” I feel bad for them.",0,1767084466.0,cfs,0,0.5,False
1pzd3ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1pzd3ju/to_my_woman/,To my woman,"Dear Caroline,

I miss you! I guess you have already moved on, but I’m still stuck here. Now that the time you’ve been gone is longer than the time you were here, I just want to be honest about why it hasn’t been easy. I didn’t realize how much of myself I had given until it was gone, and that’s why it hurt the way it did. I just didn’t lose you, I also lost the hopes and dreams I carried with you. It’s hard to wait around for some thing that I know may never happen, but it’s even harder to let go of something that I know could be more special. My life was better with than without you. I’m a grateful person and I’m always grateful for the life I’m building. But the grace I had when you were here is always greater than the grace I have now that you’re gone. If I could go back time, I would do it all again no matter how short it was. 

I really wanted to invest in you, and in us - but you broke my heart during your favorite season….I always felt peace whenever I was with you. You were my peace that blurs out the noise of this world. I was so ready to go through all the ups and downs with you because I know you are worth it. If I let my mind wander and get lost, it always finds you… I find you in a thousand small choices I make without thinking. I can't stand the thought of you with someone else and I can't stand the reality that I'm not with you anymore. I still keep your number saved. Not because I'll ever call, but deleting it feels like admitting to myself that you're never coming back...

In Vietnamese, there’s a word: nhớ. It both means “to miss” snd “to remember”. Sometimes when you miss someone, you end up remembering so many things about them - their favorite food, their favorite drink or their favorite routine. You remember the warmth of being close to them: the sound of their laughter, the color of their eyes, the scent of their hair….Everything you can feel in and through the air. And I remember all of it about you - I guess remembering things is my way of missing you. Someday I say: I remember a lot about you, and about those good days when I still had you with me. But you know “I miss you more than I could ever remember you” (Ocean Vuong)
 
I miss you! I miss seeing you excited about all the plans and dates I wanted to take you on and showed you. I really wanted to see you play the piano one day. I really wanted to get you some yarns as your birthday gifts. I really wanted to go hiking/camping with you. I really wanted to see a vogue ballroom with you. I really wanted to show you a dance battle that I’d join. I really wanted to go and see the Nutcracker ballet with you. I wanted to show you Morning Disco where we can all dance to funk/disco music with coffee in hands on a random Sunday. I wanted to plan a getaway trip with you. I really wanted to teach you snowboarding and showed you how beautiful it is from the too of a mountain... Now I’m doing all of these alone as I had been to before you, but empty. Sometimes I found myself saying ""Caroline would love this""...There’s always a part in me aching after you’ve gone, no matter what I do and how I build my life.

I miss you! Every day, every night, there’s this quiet part of me that still reaches for you, still hopes for you, still believes in us. I miss your voice, your energy, the way just hearing your name could calm me down. And I miss the version of me I got to be when you were in my life - proud, fulfilled and the most grateful.

I miss you! I miss cooking with you and all the shows we watched laying in bed next to each other. I miss how I just laid in bed snd fell asleep next to you. You would hold me and stroke my hair, and when I would wake up, you would smile and offer to make me a coffee. I miss your hand on mine walking down all the streets, in a restaurant, on the bus…we never missed a chance to hold hands. And I miss your kiss every single time we say goodbye 

I met you when I was not looking for you and I lost you when I was most sure about you. I would have always chosen you, Caroline. I always wanted it to be you, until I realized you didn’t want it to be me. As much as I wanted us to start over, you wouldn’t have chosen me…

I know this is not the love I am meant to spend my life in, but knowing that does not stop my heart from wanting you. It does not stop me from checking my phone, hoping your name is there. It does not stop me from replaying our best moments like a movie I cannot turn off. It doesn’t stop me from wondering if you were thinking about me too. I wish I could let you go. I wish I could wake up one morning and feel nothing, but instead I feel everything. I’d still get butterflies if I see you. I’d still hold my breath when you walk into a room. I do not want to want you, but I do. I want you in a way that makes no sense. I want you even though every part of me knows you will never give me the love I deserve. Even though things didn’t work out the way we wanted them to, I need you to know how deeply I loved our time together. I wouldn’t be okay if I didn’t tell you how incredible and beautiful in and out of a person you are. I am always going to remember and be grateful for you. 

Caroline, you were the partner I had been looking for. You hold all the qualities that I value in a partner and that I uphold myself to, and I don't think I can find anyone else like you.... And maybe one day, I will be strong enough to choose myself over you, and I won't find someone better than you, but better for me. But right now, I’m still choosing you even when I know better.

We will probably never meet again. So one day when you walk down the aisle and complete the great love story that's yours, I hope you remember that I'm glad to see you win. How can I claim to be on the side of love if I can't even support it in someone I once fell in love with...

Do you miss me like I miss you?

Yours,
Jes.",1,1767084393.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.99,False

I decided to test pinterest hard starting in july because I needed to diversify traffic sources

**Niche:** Home & kitchen products (amazon associates mainly)

**Strategy:** I created a pinterest business account and started posting product roundup pins (best coffee makers, best kitchen gadgets under $50 etc) Im using tailwind to schedule 12 pins per day consistently because manual posting was impossible to maintain. I joined 12 communities in the home/kitchen niche through tailwind which amplified reach significantly.

**Results timeline:** month 1: $143 in commissions (almost quit here lol), month 2: $387 in commissions, month 3: $1,240 in commissions, month 4: $2,100 in commissions

Traffic went from 340 pinterest visitors in july to 4,800+ in october and the click-through rate to Amazon is consistently 2.8-3.2% which is way higher than my SEO traffic.

**Key factors:**  with tailwinds smartpin feature I create 5-6 variations of each pin design quickly instead of spending an hour per pin in canva. The scheduling keeps me consistent even when I'm busy with other projects. Communities exposed my pins to thousands more people without spending on ads. Ghostwriter ai writes decent pin descriptions that are SEO-optimized which saves time

**Metrics that matter:** monthly impressions: 890k in october, pin saves: 2,400+, monthly CTR to my site: 1.8%, amazon CTR from site: around 3%

Biggest lesson is pinterest takes 6-8 weeks to gain traction so you cant judge results in the first month. Also product comparison pins (X vs Y) outperform generic roundup pins significantly. Vertical format 1000x1500 crushes square formats.

For affiliate marketers I'd say pinterest is seriously underrated compared to SEO right now.",2,1767084392.0,Affiliatemarketing,3,1.0,False

WFH day that somehow felt longer than my entire degree. Laptop shut at 6, brain shut at 4:30. Made filter coffee, didn’t help. Scrolled phone, helped even less.

Looked outside and Bangalore is doing that thing where it’s not raining, not sunny, just mildly judgmental. Thought about stepping out to a café, then remembered traffic exists and immediately lost 30% motivation. Classic.

Dating apps opened, closed within 5 minutes. Everyone there is “spontaneous” and “loves late-night drives”. I get tired just thinking about ORR after 7 PM. Instead, I sat quietly, listening to random bike sounds and someone upstairs dragging furniture like it’s a personal attack.

Not sad, not happy. Just very… weekday. The kind where you want human conversation but not enough energy to plan anything dramatic. Bangalore does this thing where you’re surrounded by people yet somehow alone with your thoughts and bad coffee choices.

 What I don't get is why are they so structured and coordinated? The whole point is to have fun but at the same time full of rules and coordination. 

Like not just safety rules , unnecessary rules. The group I was in had a Whatsapp group chat and the way I communicate is half texting half gifs/memes and they had a problem with that. The issue is I feel like I gotta be contained and formal and I can't just be loose which defeats the whole purpose of having fun.

When it comes to safety rules you can't even debate on stuff like let's say lane splitting/filtering and why it should be aloud/not aloud etc. not even advocating for but just debating it lmao. People are also very emotional in general and can't handle a technical convo without resulting to personal attacks. 



Another thing there's really nothing going on at meets for most bike groups all that happens is people will meet talk then leave , if there is a group ride you meet, talk, group ride, then leave. Half the time people are not even riding and meeting as a group to go have coffee and eat donuts lmao then posting it in the group chat(official group events by the way). Like that's the type of shit you do with close friends not people in a shared hobby group unless friendship evolves naturally but even then why have that as an official event lmao. But to each their own I never participated in that shit 

If your a younger rider like me then your going to automatically be disrespected by being called ""kid"" and if there is a disagreement your always going to be the one that's wrong majority of the time.(Disagreement that stemmed from someone not being able to handle a technical argument and then personally attacks your character or usually someone trying to unnecessarily police you and you tell them to basicaly F off) 

I'm prob mostly done with meeting bike groups and meets and will stick to solo riding or riding with the  people I've met and got along with once the season starts back up. 

Motorcycles are fun but the community around them is very boring, rigid , and have unnecessarily controlling leaders. It takes the fun out of it.

It started when I posted a birthday story and he replied wishing me happy birthday and asking how I was celebrating. He also shared details about his birthday and said things like celebrating with friends is nice.

The next day he asked how my birthday went, which I found a little unexpected since we don’t really know each other and even some of my close friends didn’t ask how it went. Most people usually leave it at wishing.

Then on Christmas I posted a simple “Merry Christmas” note, and he replied “Merry Christmas :)” and immediately added: “Should def hang out and do something quick like go for a coffee when we get back to school.”

I said yeah sure, just let me know when.

Later, he guessed I was from Seattle and when I asked how he knew, he replied: “May or may not have looked at your bio 😳🫢”

One more thing: he’s graduating this year (so he’s older) and I’m a first-year.

Only he has been the one initiating contact and suggesting meeting up.

So I’m confused, does this sound like someone just being friendly and social, or someone who’s low-key interested but trying to keep it chill?

1pzczeb,https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1pzczeb/endgame_pc_ghoul_vs_human_summary/,Endgame PC Ghoul vs Human Summary,"This is a short pros and cons summary focused primarily on endgame viability of Ghoul and Human playstyles. There are other factors to consider when considering Ghoulification before the end game that are not taken in account here, such as disguise system and the need for legendary perks to fit Ghoul's perks in.

Preface: both playstyles are viable and powerful, but in their own way. Which way vibes with you the most is something I would like to help you gauge in this post.



**What (endgame relevant) things Humans get that Ghouls don't?**

Access to Hunger/Thirst mechanics (especially AP generation):

* When meters are full (base): +1 Str, +1 End, +35 Max hp +35% AP Regen
* Rejuvenated Perk: up to +3 Str, +3 End, +25 Max hp, +25% AP Regen on top of the above
   * High feral meter Ghouls get only +3 Strength, +3 Endurance, +30 max HP from their meter
* Rejuvenator's 4-star Power Armor effect (up to 30hp and 30AP per second regeneration with full meters and the Rejuvenated Perk

Access to Unyielding low health playstyle:

* 1-star Unyielding Regular armor mod allows humans at low hp to benefit from huge SPECIAL stat bonus that among other things drastically increases XP gains that scale of Charisma and Intelligence

Access to Powerful Endurance perks:

* Most notably Thirst Quencher that allows to increase max AP via Endurance stat. At fairly modest 24 Endurance, this perk grants 107 Max AP
   * Note that Max AP also affects AP regen out of VATS
* Natural Resistance is fairly powerful in certain situations, specifically for poison effects (Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Queen, Ultracite Terror)

What does all of this mean?:

Humans have easier time with VATS playstyle without relying on consumables. Rejuvenator's 4-star Power Armor effect is slightly better than chugging 2 Canned Coffees that are on as long as you have max Hydration. This effect + Thirst Quencher allow one to comfortably stay in VATS for long periods of time during boss fights.



**What (endgame relevant) things Ghouls get that Humans don't?**

More Damage Potential via perks:

* Brick Wall is great both for survivability and damage uptime (Cryptids, Ultracite Terror, SBQ, and Earl)
* Science Monster - rare damage multiplier stacking additively with Taking One for the Team legendary perk
* Faulty Spots - rare damage multiplier stacking multiplicatively with Weakspot Damage bonus
* Wild West Hands - very powerful when combined with Bullet Storm builds for damage multiplier uptime.

Up to double max HP via Glow ""overhealth"" mechanic

* With Glowing Gut perk one can chug toxic goo to rapidly generate and maintain Glow, which enables certain perks and serves and a second hp bar which is great for survivability and maintaining powerful perk effects.

Incredible Melee damage when Feral

* At 0% feral meter, Ghouls get 150% melee damage bonus which is really strong for melee builds.
   * While ""baked in"" 150% melee damage bonus is amazing, it is more modest when you consider in a context of using ""Tasty yao guai roast"" or similar food that with Carnivore and SiN gives you 212% bonus melee damage. So when comparing fully buffed human and fully buffed ghoul, Feral bonus melee damage translates to around 35%-50% more actual damage for the Ghouls, which is still huge.

Immunity to radiation and diseases

* While both are situational and fairly easy to fix for humans, not having to deal with these mechanics saves time and moderately hard to get consumables such as Grape Cola and Disease Cures (Radaway risks trading radiation for diseases)



**How it affects actual playstyle?:**

Optimized humans are more self-sufficient when it comes to ranged VATS builds. They are more efficient with minimal usage on consumables primarily because of how strong Rejuvenator's effect can be. With 5 pieces of Rejuv, full hydration and company tea, you will naturally have 65-75% VATS uptime with Gauss Gatling. Switch to Minigun (surprisingly good!) for less intense fights or when farming world bosses and you will stay in VATS forever. 

Peak damage potential in ranged VATS is reserved for ghouls and Unyielding humans. Both pay for the privilege of doing big numbers damage. 

Unyielding human is risky due to low HP and relies on consumables (no Rejuv on Uny armor and vise versa)

The ghouls, unfortunately, lose a lot of ways to recoup AP and have to rely on consumables even more than Uny humans to realize their maximum potential. This is a huge barrier to entry for a lot of players. Staying at this level requires constant maintenance. If you find farming/buying coffee and using hotkeys to pop multiple consumables mid fight fun, then you will generally do noticeably better in raids when compared to humans.

Alternatively one can use Blood Sacrifice Legendary perk card to do away from AP and manage Ghoul VATS via HP. It is a bit tricky because you get less space for your perks and perks is where a lot of Ghoul magic happens. 

Overall when it comes to high damage VATS, ghouls have less risks and more options and slight damage edge available. However Uny offers a lot other things such as more XP from all sources, extra carry weight, and better server lag tolerance (higher max AP).

But once you remove VATS from equation, Ghouls perform generally better in both melee and ranged combat due to the sheer amount of extra damage multipliers they can slot. Non VATS playstyle is also less involved. 



**Other playstyle consideration:**

Meter management is slightly harder on ranged Ghouls. At first, it appears that ghouls have one less meter to manage (Feral vs Hunger/Thirst), until you realize that Glow is also a meter that needs to be managed to extract its benefit and activate certain perks. 

Both Humans and Ghouls benefit from food/drink buffs in the endgame, but only one of them fills their meters while ""buffing up"".

Feral meter is awkward since both 0% and 100% are desirable in different scenarios. Ranged Ghoul gets to use chems at will, while Melee Ghoul is losing their bonuses when consuming chems.

On the other side Glow meter is awesome. Large bonus HP pool that you can get by chugging 3-4 Toxic Goo is fantastic. The only downside is that once you lose your Glow, you are unable to build it up until you heal to 100%.

For Melee Ghouls you can forget about the feral meter altogether and rampage to your heart's content periodically chugging toxic goo. 



**What Should I chose for endgame?:**

I hate Humans: Ghoul

I hate Ghouls: Human

I want VATS combat, but do not want to lean on consumables too much: Human

I want VATS combat and I don't mind heavily leaning on consumables to achieve great damage: Ghoul.

I want VATS combat, I don't mind heavily leaning on consumables to achieve great damage, and I want to optimize my XP gain: Human

I do not enjoy VATS, but want to build strong character: Ghoul

  
**Final remark on efficiency:**

If it takes one 3 minutes to juggle their inventory and buffs to secure 1 minute boss kill, the time it took to kill the boss is 4 minutes.

If one walks in without a care and takes the boss down in 4 minutes then both are equally efficient in my eyes :D",2,1767083949.0,fo76,6,0.58,False

Woke up for work, not because I wanted to, but because my alarm has more discipline than me. Made filter coffee, opened my laptop, attended a meeting where everyone spoke except the person who scheduled it. Bangalore tech culture is basically a group project with no marks.

During lunch, scrolled dating apps for exactly 7 minutes. Enough time to see people who “love long drives” while I’m exhausted just thinking about ORR traffic. Closed the app, ate alone, stared at the office pantry wall like it had answers.

Post-work walk near my place. Couples arguing softly, single people pretending they’re on important calls. Came back, ordered dinner, Zomato greeted me like an old friend who’s seen my worst phases.

It’s just Tuesday. Nothing bad, nothing great. Life feels like it’s buffering, but the WiFi signal is full.

1pzcwi6,https://i.redd.it/xw5k46fxyaag1.jpeg,💤 What WHOOP taught me about sleep & recovery — what have you learned?,"Over the past 2 years I’ve been using WHOOP to get a better handle on my sleep, recovery and day-to-day strain. What’s surprised me most isn’t the big nights of bad sleep — it’s how often I felt fine, but WHOOP data showed my recovery was actually low.

A few patterns I’ve noticed from my own experiments:
	•	Late eating or alcohol = big HRV drop, even if I still got 7–8 hours
	•	Eating Salmon or omelette for my dinner along with baked potato and broccoli or salad had dramatic improvements in my recovery score
	•	how much emphasis whoop places on getting up the same time each morning
	•	just how much having a slice of toast with peanut butter before my morning coffee reduced my needs for coffee throughout the day

I’m trying to use the data as a guide, not a rule — but it has changed a few habits already (especially evenings).

👉 Curious what others here have seen:
	•	What’s the biggest insight WHOOP / Oura / Garmin has given you about your sleep?
	•	Have you changed any habits because of recovery scores?
	•	Do you ever ignore the data because your body feels different?",1,1767083646.0,HealthExperimentsClub,0,1.0,False

It all started back in August after a long night of edging masturbation. Typical **pain along the pelvis, urine urgency/retention and major pain from the penis tip down the urethra to the anus. Terrible insomnia.** Thought it was UTI, took **antibiotics without effect** and it possibly made it worse. Urine and prostate fluid test all came negative. Urologist believed it was CPPS and told me to do stretches and relax without giving prescription.

**Recovery wasn't a straight road**. There were good days and bad days, basically **every part of my pelvis chose to flare up once** but it always ended up better than before. In early December, I couldn't even sit for over 1 hour without cushioning and got painful hard flaccid. It got away eventually and I now pee for 6-8 times a day compared to 10+ before. My advice is to stay positive even when it hurts and do not think too much about it. **No PFPT in this part of the world, I would have tried if possible**.

**Exercises/stretches**: Paused cycling completely for 2 months, then keep it under 40km once bi-weekly. Kept moderate running or hiking at least 3 times a day, sometime spending whole day outside on weekends. It warms up the pelvis and good circulation keeps pain down. I do the usually reverse-kegel stretches and McGill Big 3 for core. Do not start the core exercises until you get a little better.

**Supplements/medicine**: Early on, cranberry pills helped me to pee (against retention) and took phenazopyridine to ease pain. Do not recommend antibiotics even if it briefly helped. Then I took paracetamol/acetaminophen and later ibuprofen to kill pain. Took valium and zolpidem from family doctor on difficult nights. For supplement, quercetin and pollen seem helpful. Tried saw palmetto but it didn't help much. I was already taking that with vitamin B mix for hair loss prevention before.

**Habit/sexual activities**: Still trying to sleep 1-1.5 hours earlier than before, but insomnia is still frequent and I usually end up falling asleep at the same time. Melatonin helps and I take it the night before a non-working day. It gets me too dizzy for morning work. I am now keeping sex/masturbation until 3 times a week. Only do it when I feel good to. Drink a glass of water to pee afterwards to clean urethra. Keep good hygiene.

**Avoiding triggers**: Strong coffee and tea will hurt after getting peed out, alcohol does the same and spirits (whiskey, vodka) are the worst. Spicy food will do the same. I try to walk around after 2-3 hours of sitting at the office, it helps to relief. Work stress gets thing worse too - I took holiday whenever possible.

Hopefully it will be less of a bother by the 6 months mark (late Jan). Recovery can be slow after the initial 2 months, but keep up the pattern and it will get better. Good luck!",3,1767083552.0,Prostatitis,5,0.81,False

Hello,  
Posting here with full sincerity and mild self-roasting.

I’m 24, Bangalore-based, software engineer. I write code all day and still can’t debug why my dating life returns *null*. Dating apps? Tried. Matched. Chatted. Then people vanished like autos when it starts raining.

About me so you don’t imagine wrong DLCs later:
- Vegetarian  
- Don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t club  
- Peak excitement = quiet café, long walk, deep talks, judging café prices silently  
- Calm, introverted-ish, emotionally available (rare species, I know)

I’m not here for “hi/hey/wyd?” speedruns or trauma-dumping on day one. I’m here for good, human conversations - the kind where replies don’t feel like homework and disappearing isn’t a hobby.

Topics I can talk about without buffering:
- Life in Bangalore (traffic deserves its own therapy group)  
- Work, career confusion, adulting scams  
- Travel dreams I keep postponing  
- Overthinking, but in a funny way  
- Why dating feels harder than cracking system design rounds

Not in a rush to marry by next long weekend. Not into games. Just open to meeting someone kind, curious, and emotionally functional enough to reply after some time without going into witness protection.

If you’re a woman who prefers calm > chaos, conversations > chaos, and filter coffee > chaos (you see the pattern), feel free to message with a proper intro.

Worst case: we have a nice chat.  
Best case: we both uninstall at least one dating app.

    It was always good to see her come home or in the front door or just pulling in the lot to meet me for dinner. It sent a thrill though me like the spark of electricity just did. 
    Having spent enough time in the cold it was time to go in and I opened the front door and welcomed her home. 
      No place like home, ran though my mind as it was a warm cozy place to be but she always made it a place worth being.

This is a vulnerable post to write, but I know I’m not alone and if this helps even one person feel less isolated, it’s worth it. My wife experienced this too, so at least for us, its less isolating :D

Faecal incontinence after childbirth is far more common than people talk about. Pelvic floor trauma, tears, nerve damage, forceps, prolonged labour all of these can affect bowel control, sometimes temporarily, sometimes longer term. And yet it’s still something many mums suffer with quietly, feeling embarrassed or “broken”.

I want to share a few things that have helped me cope. I’ve lived with bowel control issues most of my life, so while the causes may differ, the **day-to-day reality** is very similar.

# A few practical things that genuinely help

**1. You didn’t do anything wrong**  
This is not a personal failure. It’s a physical injury or dysfunction, just like a torn muscle or nerve damage anywhere else in the body.

**2. Pelvic floor physio is worth pursuing (if accessible)**  
Not just kegels but proper assessment. Bowel symptoms are often overlooked compared to bladder ones, so it may take advocating for yourself.

**3. Know your triggers**  
Coffee, rushing, anxiety, certain foods, sudden movements. Patterns do emerge over time. For me its early morning. Awareness alone can reduce accidents.

**4. “Just in case” protection can be life-changing**  
This is a big one. For years, the hardest part for me wasn’t the symptom it was the *fear* of leaving the house, being caught out, or smelling.

Most pads on the market are designed for urine, not bowel leakage. They’re thin, rely heavily on gel absorbents, and don’t always provide the right coverage or containment for stool. Many people end up using nappies, which can feel bulky, noisy, and incredibly demoralising.

Because I couldn’t find anything discreet that actually worked for bowel leakage, I eventually helped create [IB3 pads](http://www.ib3discreet.com)**,** they’re bowel-specific, discreet, and designed around real-world faecal incontinence rather than hospital use or bladder leaks. I’m mentioning this openly because I *wish* something like this had existed for me years ago.

If you’re struggling, please know there **are options**, and needing reassurance doesn’t mean you’re “giving up” on recovery.

**5. Shame makes this harder. Not better**  
You’re still a good mum. A capable adult. A whole person. This symptom doesn’t erase that.

If you’re comfortable, feel free to share what you’re dealing with or ask questions here. Even just reading this and knowing you’re not alone matters.

1pzcpr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Beingabetterperson/comments/1pzcpr0/the_subtle_habits_that_make_people_instantly/,The Subtle Habits That Make People Instantly RESPECT You: Science-Based Psychology Cheat Codes,"okay so i spent way too much time studying this. like actually researching what makes certain people command respect without even trying. read dozens of books on psychology, watched interviews with charisma coaches, listened to podcasts about human behavior. and honestly? most advice out there is recycled garbage.

the truth is way more interesting. respect isn't about being the loudest person in the room or having the fanciest job title. it's about these tiny behavioral patterns that signal competence, authenticity, and emotional intelligence. most people miss them entirely.

here's what actually works:

**stop explaining yourself constantly**

this one hit different when i first learned about it. robert greene talks about this in ***the 48 laws of power*** (yeah i know it sounds manipulative but hear me out). the book is basically a historical analysis of power dynamics, written by a guy who studied strategy under hollywood executives.

when you over explain your decisions, you subconsciously signal insecurity. ""sorry i can't make it tonight, my cat has a vet appointment and also i have this work thing and honestly i've been really tired lately and..."" vs ""i can't make it tonight, but let's reschedule soon.""

people who respect themselves don't feel the need to justify every choice. they just state their boundaries clearly and move on. it's not about being rude. it's about understanding that your time and decisions have inherent value.

**master the pause**

this comes from negotiation research and honestly it's kind of wild how effective it is. chris voss (former fbi hostage negotiator) breaks this down in ""***never split the difference***"". before he was teaching negotiation tactics, he was literally talking people off ledges and negotiating kidnapping releases.

when someone asks you something, especially something challenging, don't rush to fill the silence. pause. think. then respond. rushing signals anxiety. pausing signals confidence and thoughtfulness.

people unconsciously interpret that pause as ""this person's thoughts are valuable enough to require consideration."" sounds weird but it works. even in casual conversation, that extra second before responding makes people lean in more.

**fix your posture but make it subtle**

not like military rigid. just... taking up your space. amy cuddy's research on body language (yeah the ted talk person) found that how you hold yourself literally changes your hormone levels. expansive postures increase testosterone and decrease cortisol.

but here's the thing nobody talks about: it's not about power posing in front of people. it's about training your default resting position. shoulders back, chin level, feet planted. when this becomes automatic, people perceive you as more capable without knowing why.

there's this app called ""posture pal"" that randomly buzzes you throughout the day to check in. sounds annoying but after like two weeks it becomes automatic.

**listen like you're getting paid for it**

most people listen just enough to figure out when they can talk next. real respect comes from making others feel genuinely heard.

practical tip: when someone finishes speaking, pause for one full second before responding. then reference something specific they said. ""you mentioned feeling overwhelmed with the project timeline, what part is causing the most stress?""

the book ""***just listen""*** by mark goulston (psychiatrist who worked with fbi on hostage situations, similar to voss) explains this perfectly. he calls it ""listening with fascination"" rather than listening with judgment or advice queued up.

people will literally describe you as ""so intelligent"" and ""such good company"" when really you just... listened well. wild but true.

**disagree without being disagreeable**

this is from ""difficult conversations"" by the harvard negotiation project team. instead of ""no you're wrong about that"" try ""interesting, i see it a bit differently because...""

you can hold your ground without making someone feel stupid. that's rare. people respect the hell out of someone who can challenge their ideas while still making them feel respected. it signals intellectual confidence rather than ego protection.

**stop apologizing for existing**

""sorry, can i ask a quick question?"" no. just ""hey, quick question.""

""sorry for the long email"" becomes ""thanks for reading.""

""sorry i'm late"" (when you're 2 minutes late) becomes ""thanks for waiting.""

reframing apologies into gratitude shifts the entire dynamic. apologizing constantly trains people to see you as someone who's always in the wrong. thanking them positions you as equals.

there's this concept in psychology called ""self deprecation bias"" where people think constant apologies make them seem humble and likeable. research shows it actually does the opposite. makes people perceive you as less competent.

**follow through on tiny commitments**

this is probably the most underrated one. ""i'll send you that article"" and then actually sending it. ""let's grab coffee soon"" and then actually suggesting a time within a week.

people are drowning in flaky behavior. when you're the person who actually does what they say, even with small stuff, you become memorable. your word starts carrying weight.

the compound effect of this is insane. after six months of being reliable with little things, people start trusting you with bigger things. they recommend you. they want you around.

**own your mistakes quickly and specifically**

""my bad"" is lazy. ""i messed up the timeline on that report, here's how i'm fixing it"" shows accountability and competence simultaneously.

people don't lose respect when you make mistakes. they lose respect when you deflect, make excuses, or pretend it didn't happen. brené brown's research on vulnerability (she's a shame and empathy researcher at university of houston) found that people who own their failures are perceived as more trustworthy and capable.

**stop filling every silence with noise**

comfortable silence is a dominance display in the animal kingdom and honestly? still applies to humans. when you're okay with quiet moments in conversation, it signals security. anxious people fill every gap with chatter.

next time you're in a group setting, notice who's comfortable with silence and who's scrambling to fill it. the comfortable ones tend to command more respect.

**other resources that helped**

BeFreed is an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni that creates personalized podcasts from books, research papers, and expert talks. What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan, it actually builds a structured path based on your specific goals and struggles. You can adjust the depth too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives with detailed examples depending on your mood.

The voice customization is legitimately addictive. There's a smoky, sarcastic option that makes even dry psychology concepts entertaining during commutes. Plus there's a virtual coach avatar you can chat with to ask questions or get book recommendations. Helps turn all these concepts into something you can actually internalize through flashcards and a personal mindspace feature. Worth checking out if you're serious about consistent growth.

real talk though, this isn't about manipulating people or playing mind games. it's about developing genuine self respect that naturally radiates outward. people can smell fake confidence from a mile away. but when you actually value yourself, set boundaries, and show up authentically? that's what creates lasting respect.

none of this happens overnight. took me months to internalize even half of these. but the shift is noticeable. people started asking my opinion more. including me in decisions. taking my time seriously.

Allow me to entertain you by interrupting your meme streak with my experience of great story with happy beginning and sad endings. If you want happy endings skip now and go to those massage centers spread across the city. 

Story 1: the cafe who won too hard

A fancy french cafe opens a beautiful speciality coffee shop in a up town mall. First month they hit huge in revenue in the first month. The mall management's reaction? ""Incredible! Let's celebrate by opening ten identical cafes right next to you."" It's like your mom praising your drawing by hanging it on the fridge, then inviting every kid in the neighborhood to scribble over it. The business model: punish success. Genius.


Story 2:  Real Estate Drama That Needs Its Own Soap Opera

A property company had assets worth way more than its debt.But they forgot to have actual cash to pay the loan. So they went bankrupt. Now the assets are worth triple, and the family is too busy suing each other over a fraction of the value to actually, you know, get rich. This is the financial equivalent of starving to death while sitting on a golden throne. (This get even worse if like to hear more) 

Story 3: ""YouTube of the Middle East"" That Couldn't Figure Out YouTube

A team had the next big video platform.They had the users, the traffic, the vibe. They shut it down. Why? The money people in charge looked at the content creator model and said, ""But why are we giving people free storage?"" They saw a cost center where the entire internet saw a revolution. It's like buying a football team and being confused about why you need to pay for a ball. (I personally had gained popularity on this platform) 

Story 4: The Amazon Rival That Decapitated Itself

A big player bought a cool local e-commerce site.Their brilliant first move? Fire the founders who built the whole thing. Replace them with random ""cheap"" managers. Shockingly, the magic disappeared. They then had to get, let's say, ""legally creative"" to finish off the founders. This is the business version of buying a championship race car and immediately replacing the engine with a toaster.

So, what's the moral for investors chasing the UAE dream?

The potential is real. The money is here. But you gotta look past the glitter.

1. Check the lease. Is your brilliant tenant about to become target practice for their own landlord?
2. Follow the cash, not the asset list. A golden goose is useless if it can't pay its water bill.
3. Make sure the people with the money understand the business. If they think ""content"" is an expense, run.
4. If you buy a company, maybe keep the people who made it worth buying? Wild concept, I know.

This place is a rollercoaster with every down comes adrenaline rush will your competition keeps falling off for good you but that momentum to gain new gains and buckle up for more downs.
