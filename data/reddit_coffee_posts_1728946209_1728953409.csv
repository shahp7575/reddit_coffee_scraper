I have been thinking of moving to Seattle or Kirkland next year when my current lease ends. I have the option for WFH, I don‚Äôt have to commute work but I would like to for few days a week. The office is in Kirkland. I‚Äôm an avid hiker, climber( getting into outdoor), novice mountaineer. I would like to live close to a climbing gym. Is it good decision to move.

I came home from physical therapy earlier today and had some watery bright red spotting. And okay, I‚Äôm 4w+6 and spotting is expected! I had some last week and wasn‚Äôt concerned. But this time there was a kind of bloody sediment in the toilet bowl that looked a bit like coffee grounds or crumbs, but deep red. It‚Äôs that part that‚Äôs the most concerning to me. I also have been having light cramps since then.

Of course I hop on Reddit to see if there are other people who have talked about a similar type of symptom, and I feel like everything I‚Äôve seen is split between ‚Äú‚Ä¶and I have my healthy baby here with me today!‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Ä¶and yep, miscarriage‚Äù. I called my OB and she had me come in to do an HCG test, which we‚Äôll likely do again in two days. And I know that it could very well be totally fine, but I am a WRECK knowing that I have to wait another two days without knowing if things are okay or not!

To top that off, when I tried to drive to the lab for the bloodwork, I discovered that someone tried to steal my car (AGAIN! Dangit, Hyundai!) and now it no longer has a drivers side door handle, and the steering column is wire spaghetti. MAN OH MAN! üòÇüò≠ Today truly is cursed!

Send me your best vibes because I NEED THEM. ‚ù§Ô∏è I am a ball of tears and could use some reassurance over here.",1,1728953213.0,June2025Bumps,0,1.0,False

# Backstory

36M that ran in high school XC and track, then off and on over the years. Nothing structured with a few 5K and 10K races thrown in. I signed up for the 2023 Long Beach Half Marathon on a whim. I proceeded to do zero training until 6 weeks before, where I ran every few days, and a longest run of 6.55 miles. My thought was if I felt like I could do that twice, I would go for it.

Ended up running it in 2:04:45 and had a BLAST doing it. I decided to sign up for the next years half marathon to see how much I could improve in a year. I started doing structured training for a HM in February then did another plan for a HM in May, with 5Ks and 10Ks sprinkled in as fitness tests.

October: 2:04:45 HM  
January: 22:22 5K  
February: 1:14:27 HM  
April: 42:23 10K and 19:49 5K  
May: 1:33:48 HM

I was hitting times I hadn't come close to since high school. I was learning a lot during each race that I took with me to the next event. My race times reflected progress and I was super motivated to train for the 2024 Long Beach Half Marathon over the summer. Given the progress I was making I set a goal for sub 1:30.

# Training

I started a 20 week training program through Runna that started in May. I had previously used Runna for my February and May HMs. I was at 26 MPW peak mileage for the February HM and 36 MPW for the May HM. For this block I decided to run 6 days a week (from 5 previously) and slowly increase mileage to hit 55 MPW. I did this because I had the time to do it and I wanted to see how my body reacted to this sort of mileage in case I wanted to train for a spring marathon.

To my surprise Runna predicted a 1:26:30 time based off my last half marathon. That seemed insane to me at the time (sub 1:30 was daunting enough) but I decided to trust the process and go for it. The plan was HARD. I found myself dreading the (2) speed workouts every week because it was taking everything out of me. The plan was also increasing in mileage and it was rough on my body. The good news is my body reacted very well to 6 days a week of running and I was feeling more resilient in general, but the speed workouts were kicking my butt. The plan was also too long. That was my fault because I set it to 20 weeks when Runna suggested 12 for a HM. Around halfway through I was getting burnt out. I wasn't sure I was progressing and I felt like the plan was a bit too hot. I dialed it back slightly, changing my target to 1:27:30.

This worked WONDERS. I ended up having a great 5K and 10K during full mileage weeks and felt like I was making progress.

August: 19:10 5K  
September: 39:30 10K

Towards the end of the training I was feeling great during the longer tempo work. Garmin updated their race predictor algorithm and was now predicting a 1:25:40 half! I took it with a grain of salt as previously it would predict a slower time for a race AFTER I had just run a faster time, but it still gave me a bit of confidence. I wondered if I could overperform the 1:27:30 goal with a 1:26:XX time. I set that as my new A goal with my C goal as my original sub 1:30 goal I set for myself in May.

I started to have doubts when I got a head cold right as my taper started. I felt like garbage throughout the taper and wondered if I would be able to hit 1:30 let alone 1:27:30. I kept telling myself this was a combination of the head cold and taper tantrums. I had to trust that on race day I would feel ready for the occasion.

# Pre-race

The week before the race the weather prediction was a heat wave with record temperatures on Sunday. Even though it was completely out of my control I found myself getting upset that after 20 weeks of hard training I could be derailed by excessive heat in October! The race organizers shifted the start to 30 minutes earlier to 6:30am. As the week went on the forecast shifted to be cooler and cloudy, with the day of weather being 60 degrees and cloudy!

Unfortunately I slept horribly that night, and did not sleep great throughout the week. I guess the nerves got to me because I could not seem to fall asleep no matter how tired I was. I slept for minutes at a time before finally getting up at 3:30am. I felt like garbage but after getting some food and coffee I felt surprisingly good!

Getting there ended up being a total cluster as downtown Long Beach was shut down without clear direction to the parking lot I prepaid for at the race expo. Fortunately my girlfriend woke up at zero dark thirty to drive me there. I ended up having to get out of the car and do my warmup to the race start with just enough time to use the restroom and get in my corral. Lesson learned to get there much earlier next time. The stress of getting to the start line in time is not how you want to spend the time before the race. Luckily my girlfriend and her parents found me right before the race start so give me my gels I left in the car and wish me luck. Once the dust settled and I was in place I felt ready to go!

# Race

The gun goes off at 6:30am right as the sun is coming up behind the overcast skies. The weather was slightly warmer than I would have liked, but given that earlier in the week we thought it would be in the 80s and sunny during the race I was not complaining. The start was fairly chaotic, with a lot of runners towards the front that were either starting off at a slow pace or decided to sprint out of the start before immediately walking without moving to the side.

The plan was to start with the 1:30 pacers for at least the first mile to not overdue it and pay for it later in the race. I thought I started near them but after the crowd spread out from the start they were a good ways ahead of me. I look down at my watch and see I am going out at a 6:20 pace after a quarter of a mile, so I pull back to 6:40 pace with the 1:30 pacers not getting any closer. I found a guy who seemed to be inching closer to them as well and used him as my target to pick off.

We are a few miles in when we caught up to (more like crashed into) the last wave of the marathon. This became a challenge as they fairly spread out and there was more weaving to get around them. I tried to stay to the left as much as possible but many of the walkers were 3-4 wide. I had to squeeze between a lot of them, which I felt bad about but there was no other way to get around them on the shared course.

Between miles 4 and 5 I finally catch up to the 1:30 pacers. Either I started much farther back than I thought from them or they went out really hot. There is a large group with them that I debated tucking in with for awhile, but I was feeling good at 6:40 and decided to go by them during the uphill segment on a bridge, including the guy I was targeting to pick off. This ended up working as motivation for the next few miles when I was feeling tired because I did not want to risk them catching up to the guy who went by them on an uphill and burnt out later.

I decided to take my one and only gel of the race right at mile 5. I use Maurten for races since they are the easiest on my stomach. I slowly take it over a half mile or so. If I take the gel in one swoop I tend to cramp. I pass my parents and girlfriend cheering a little past mile 6. This gave me a nice little boost (have to look good going by right?) and I took off to the second half of the race. Long Beach has a good 2-3 miles on the beach strand, which is nice and flat. This whole time I am still navigating marathon traffic, but by this point most of the marathoners are at least jogging and are keeping to the right. There are a few half marathoners that I am trying to pick off, but this dried up by the time we turned around to head back the 3 miles to the finish.

At this point the marathoners turn right and the half marathoners continue down the street to the finish. After the past what felt like forever navigating slower marathon traffic it now felt like I had the whole road to myself. There were a few people ahead of me but I could only see 2-3 half marathoners. Long Beach is overall flat, with only a few hills. Unfortunately this is where the hills were. They were not anything extreme, but with only a few miles left they felt much steeper than reality. I was able to slowly pick someone else off, who cheered me on as I passed him. I was so out of it focused on moving forward at pace that I could just muster up a thumbs up. Random stranger who decided to cheer on the person passing you on a hill, I appreciate you. Similar to pace group it gave me motivation to keep pace so he didn't pass me because I burnt out on the hill.

Around mile 12 someone comes up behind me and blows right by me. He also cheers me on, but it felt a lot worse when the guy smoking you (while seeming like he's barely trying) gives you cheers. For a split second I think about trying to stay with him, but he was moving way too fast. Around here is where the marathon course integrates back and is shared until the finish, but no runners popped out. Up ahead is a turn that I know leads to a downhill to the finish. I start picking it up as much as I can before hitting the turn then emptying the tank down to the finish.

I pass one last guy in the chute and look up to see the timer say 1:27:21 as I cross the finish line.

# Post-race

My immediate feeling after crossing the finish line was relief. I had crossed the 1:30 barrier and then some. I was thrilled with my time, which was a 37 minutes improvement over last year! Like the other races I learned a lot from this one that I'll be able to take with me in the future. In hindsight I think I could have pushed a little harder to get that 1:26:XX time, but I ran a smart race that was much faster than anything I've ever done.

Now that this year long goal is finally done I have my sights set on the marathon. I got into the Tokyo Marathon lottery, so that will be my first marathon on March 2nd. I have a month off from structured training before heading into my 16 week marathon block. I am not sure what to expect for the marathon, but with the base I've built over the past year I am excited to see what's possible!

I found it odd that she didn't ask me many questions on the chat beforehand and on the date, which went for two and a halfish hours she was basically talking about herself all the time not really asking me any relevant questions that stated interest in me as a person. She also mentioned her ex which I found kind of annoying, giving me some red flag vibes. It seems to have been over a year but she had a rough time and he apparently has the same name as me. So I told the staff to split the bill. We're in europe so it's not that big of a deal in dating culture I guess, but in that moment I didn't know if I enjoyed the time because my head couldn't keep up with all the information. 

She was flirting with eye contact so she probably found me appealing. I generally found her cute, smart and entertaining with the other stuff she talked about but yeah, the points stated got me thinking.  After that we walked for a little bit talking more, she thanked me for the nice evening and that was it. 

She told me it was her first date ever so I think she was basically a little aflutter. She never used dating apps but she said some female friends found a boyfriend this way so she wanted to give it a chance but she also never met a boyfriend outside of her social circle so she maybe doesn't know the game. 

After that she wrote me on the app ""here's my insta if you want to keep in touch ;)"" which kind of annoyed me a bit more because I hate using socials as a messenger apart from memes. 

After talking to some female friends they said to give her a second chance, so I wrote her on insta that I enjoyed the time and we could do something again when she's back from her holiday if she wanted to and she just liked the message ü§∑ my best bro told me to just go for the next one and now I'm a little torn apart on what to do now. Probably asking her out seeing if I feel better next time but I don't want my time wasted because I'm searching for something serious.

**Prompt:** 

**I** want to make a fragrance. these are the inspiration for this new fragrance: Creed Royal Oud, Creed Viking, Initio Narcotic Delight, and Azzaro The Most Wanted. Give me the formula with ingredient names and amounts for me to make a 50ml bottle of eau de parfum.

**Response:** 

Creating a fragrance inspired by **Creed Royal Oud**, **Creed Viking**, **Initio Narcotic Delight**, and **Azzaro The Most Wanted** requires understanding the key notes of these perfumes and how they blend together. For your 50ml Eau de Parfum, the fragrance concentration typically ranges from 15% to 20%, so the formula will contain about 12.5ml to 17ml of essential oils, absolutes, and aroma compounds. The rest will be alcohol (ethanol) and a small amount of water to balance the mixture.

Here‚Äôs a possible formula, blending the inspiration notes:

# Top Notes (Bright and Fresh)

* **Bergamot** (citrusy, vibrant): 2.5ml
* **Lemon Zest** (zesty, fresh): 1.5ml
* **Pink Pepper** (spicy, sharp): 0.5ml
* **Mint** (cool, fresh): 0.3ml

# Heart Notes (Warm, Spicy, Floral)

* **Rose Absolute** (floral, warm): 1.0ml
* **Cardamom** (spicy, aromatic): 0.8ml
* **Jasmine Sambac** (exotic floral): 0.7ml
* **Oud Accord** (woody, deep): 1.5ml

# Base Notes (Warm, Woody, Sweet)

* **Sandalwood** (smooth, woody): 2.0ml
* **Amber** (resinous, warm): 1.2ml
* **Vanilla** (sweet, creamy): 1.0ml
* **Tonka Bean** (sweet, spicy, nutty): 1.0ml
* **Patchouli** (earthy, woody): 0.8ml
* **Musk** (clean, sensual): 0.5ml

# Solvent

* **Perfumers Alcohol**: 33ml (balance the rest of the liquid)
* **Distilled Water**: Optional, 2-3ml (adjust to desired strength and blend)

# Method:

1. **Blend the Essential Oils and Aroma Compounds**: Start by mixing the essential oils and absolutes in a glass container, ensuring that the oils are well blended.
2. **Add Perfumers Alcohol**: Slowly add perfumers alcohol to the oil mixture, stirring gently.
3. **Rest and Mature**: Let the mixture rest in a dark, cool place for 2-4 weeks to allow the notes to meld.
4. **Filter and Dilute**: After the resting period, filter the fragrance through a coffee filter or fine mesh to remove any sediment. Add distilled water if necessary to achieve the right balance.
5. **Bottle**: Pour into a 50ml glass perfume bottle using a funnel, and let it sit for another few days before using.

This will create a 50ml eau de parfum that blends the citrus and spice of Viking, the oud and wood of Royal Oud, the floral narcotics of Narcotic Delight, and the warmth and sweetness from Azzaro The Most Wanted.

1g3veqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1g3veqp/weight_loss_can_be_a_very_slow_process_and_thats/,Weight loss can be a very slow process and that‚Äôs okay! ,"Just some self-reflection on my weight loss journey thus far. Hopefully this can inspire some of you who have 50 plus pounds to lose! ü§ó

It took me four years to lose 80 lbs. I was averaging a weight loss of 1-2 lbs per month. Four years may seem like a long time to a lot of people. But the reality is that weight loss requires patience. I urge you all to look at the statistics and research out there on weight loss. You‚Äôll find that very few people are successful in their weight loss attempts and maintaining it (1-3%). You‚Äôll also find that most people only lose 5-10% of their body weight. But don‚Äôt let that discourage you because I lost 36% of my body weight. Once I learned about insulin resistance and it‚Äôs link to obesity, that‚Äôs when I started losing the weight and keeping it off! I urge you all to look up insulin resistance. This is probably the reason why you‚Äôre fat. 

Growing up, I wasn‚Äôt overweight. The weight started piling on after high school. Left to my own devices, I made poor lifestyle choices because I lacked the wisdom I have now. I ate like shit and became sedentary. I used to eat a lot of sweets, DoorDash/UberEats all the time, eat out all the time, etc. I went from wearing a size xs to being unable to find clothes that fit. I ballooned to the 220s and it really showed because I‚Äôm short. It‚Äôs so crazy because I was so in denial about my size for the longest time ever. I didn‚Äôt really notice how big I had gotten until I‚Äôd look at pictures of myself someone else took lol.

I did not calorie count for the most part. I did in the beginning of my journey but it got soooo annoying. And it makes me obsess over food. 

Here‚Äôs what I did (not in order. Just a list):
1. I deleted my DoorDash and Uber eats accounts. I had an addiction to food delivery :/
2. I strictly ate home cooked meals unless I was socializing with friends and family. That‚Äôs the only time I would eat out. I eat very healthy. 
3. Absolutely no snacking. I had a binge eating problem and if I snacked, I simply would not stop.
4. I started my meals off by eating a piece of kale or a date or a salad. The point is eating some fibre before your meal is super important because it prevents a blood sugar spike. Super important. 
5. I always got moving after eating. I would clean my kitchen or go for a walk. Also super important. 
6. I didn‚Äôt eat very much. I would eat two meals per day. And the reason why is because I‚Äôm short so I don‚Äôt require a lot of calories and I don‚Äôt really work out.
7. I hate working out tbh. But exercising is super important. So what do I do? I walk! I love walking! I walk every single day and average 10-12k steps per day. I just put on my headphones and listen to an audiobook and get to stepping. EXERCISE IS SO IMPORTANT! If you hate it, then just walk.
8. I heavily reduced my sugar intake. I don‚Äôt eat sweets anymore unless I‚Äôm socializing or if it‚Äôs a special event. I find that if I get in the habit of consuming sugar regularly, I won‚Äôt stop craving it. I drink my teas without sugar now. I drink my coffees without sugar. Diet drinks only. Avoid liquid calories if you can and instead eat a fulfilling meal.

The good news is that I‚Äôm no longer overweight. But I still have a ways to go. The next step for me is to start going to the gym for flexibility and strength. 

You just have to be real with yourself and think about the habits that led you to the size you are now. And you need to think about the lifestyle change required to reach your girl. Just be consistent and patient. I fell of a couple of times in the past four years. I wasn‚Äôt perfect but I was consistent. Good luck!",1,1728952929.0,loseit,0,1.0,False

3. **Rest and Mature**: Let the mixture rest in a dark, cool place for 2-4 weeks to allow the notes to meld.
4. **Filter and Dilute**: After the resting period, filter the fragrance through a coffee filter or fine mesh to remove any sediment. Add distilled water if necessary to achieve the right balance.
5. **Bottle**: Pour into a 50ml glass perfume bottle using a funnel, and let it sit for another few days before using.

This will create a 50ml eau de parfum that blends the citrus and spice of Viking, the oud and wood of Royal Oud, the floral narcotics of Narcotic Delight, and the warmth and sweetness from Azzaro The Most Wanted.

  
Creating a fragrance inspired by **Creed Royal Oud**, **Creed Viking**, **Initio Narcotic Delight**, and **Azzaro The Most Wanted** requires understanding the key notes of these perfumes and how they blend together. For your 50ml Eau de Parfum, the fragrance concentration typically ranges from 15% to 20%, so the formula will contain about 12.5ml to 17ml of essential oils, absolutes, and aroma compounds. The rest will be alcohol (ethanol) and a small amount of water to balance the mixture.

Here‚Äôs a possible formula, blending the inspiration notes:

# Top Notes (Bright and Fresh)

* **Bergamot** (citrusy, vibrant): 2.5ml
* **Lemon Zest** (zesty, fresh): 1.5ml
* **Pink Pepper** (spicy, sharp): 0.5ml
* **Mint** (cool, fresh): 0.3ml

# Heart Notes (Warm, Spicy, Floral)

* **Rose Absolute** (floral, warm): 1.0ml
* **Cardamom** (spicy, aromatic): 0.8ml
* **Jasmine Sambac** (exotic floral): 0.7ml
* **Oud Accord** (woody, deep): 1.5ml

# Base Notes (Warm, Woody, Sweet)

* **Sandalwood** (smooth, woody): 2.0ml
* **Amber** (resinous, warm): 1.2ml
* **Vanilla** (sweet, creamy): 1.0ml
* **Tonka Bean** (sweet, spicy, nutty): 1.0ml
* **Patchouli** (earthy, woody): 0.8ml
* **Musk** (clean, sensual): 0.5ml

# Solvent

* **Perfumers Alcohol**: 33ml (balance the rest of the liquid)
* **Distilled Water**: Optional, 2-3ml (adjust to desired strength and blend)

# Method:

1. **Blend the Essential Oils and Aroma Compounds**: Start by mixing the essential oils and absolutes in a glass container, ensuring that the oils are well blended.
2. **Add Perfumers Alcohol**: Slowly add perfumers alcohol to the oil mixture, stirring gently.
3. **Rest and Mature**: Let the mixture rest in a dark, cool place for 2-4 weeks to allow the notes to meld.
4. **Filter and Dilute**: After the resting period, filter the fragrance through a coffee filter or fine mesh to remove any sediment. Add distilled water if necessary to achieve the right balance.
5. **Bottle**: Pour into a 50ml glass perfume bottle using a funnel, and let it sit for another few days before using.

This will create a 50ml eau de parfum that blends the citrus and spice of Viking, the oud and wood of Royal Oud, the floral narcotics of Narcotic Delight, and the warmth and sweetness from Azzaro The Most Wanted.",0,1728952866.0,fragrance,0,0.5,False
1g3vdt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1g3vdt6/i_have_a_cowork_who_hated_me_since_i_started/,I have a Co-work who hated me since I started working with her,"I (24F) started to work at a coffee place and first day there, this girl (18F) let's call her Lisa, just gave off a weird aura to me. At the time, I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I didn‚Äôt like being around her or why she gave off this aura. Since I was new to making coffee, it took me a couple of weeks to understand how to make different coffee without asking the other coworkers for help. Lisa always gave me the ‚Äúyou should know how to make the drink‚Äù look when I asked what ingredients or how many pumps of syrup a certain drink gets in the first 2 weeks of working with her. I was shocked since Lisa has been working there longer than me and should be nice to help me understand the drinks. But my lovely manager, let's call her Callie, was very helpful in stepping in when I asked questions. Lisa ended up helping me every time Callie was around and stopped when Callie wasn‚Äôt around. I was confused about why Lisa did this but didn‚Äôt question it.¬†

During the second week of working with Lisa, she asked me ‚ÄòHow many hours do you plan to work each week?‚Äô. When I got hired, the high-upper manager, let's call her Terri, told me during the interview, that I would only be a part-time employee until I worked with the company for about a year before becoming a full-time employee. I‚Äôm in college working on my bachelor's online so working part-time is okay for me, but I did tell Callie and Terri, that I do have an open schedule as long I have time to work on my classwork.¬†

So I told Lisa, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care how many hours I work each week, as long I come in and make some money.‚Äô When I told Lisa this, she glared at me and said, ‚ÄòWell, don‚Äôt expect to work more than 15 hours a week. It took me a while to work more than 15 hours a week.‚Äô Lisa has only been working at the company for about 9 months at this time and she just graduated high school. I was taken aback by what Lisa said to me and continued to work making drinks for customers.¬†

After working at the company for a month, Lisa quickly found out I was working about 25 to 39 hours a week and was making more money an hour than her. I soon quickly felt Lisa's aura turn anger to me every time I was around her and she talked about me in Spanish to the other co-workers who speak Spanish. I don‚Äôt understand Spanish, but I know when someone talks about me in a different language because of the tone they use. So, I just stopped talking to her until she asked me to get some more cups or other supplies we needed for work. I know Lisa didn‚Äôt like me but I‚Äôm confused about what I did to her to make her hate me so much.¬†

It soon came to me that Lisa is very self-centered and gets jealous quickly. For example, Lisa's boyfriend also works in the same company as us but in a different section. Every time Lisa saw any young teenage girl customer walk up to her boyfriend to ask a question, she glared at the customer and quietly said, ‚ÄòWhat does that b\*\*\* want from him?‚Äù I see no reason for Lisa to act like this when a customer is only asking a question to her boyfriend.

Another example happened to me. It happened one morning when Terri came to pick up the coffee she ordered online when Lisa and I were scheduled together. Lisa and Terri were talking which I didn‚Äôt pay to attend because I was making drinks, until I heard Terri say my name. Terri told Lisa that I was her new favorite employee and Lisa quickly looked at me. I just stood there shocked since I don‚Äôt talk to Terri a lot but only say hi to her when I see her in the morning or when I ask her to approve a shift cover. I could feel Lisa's aura shift again, and I quickly returned to make drinks for online orders. Lisa asked Terri why I was her favorite employee and Terri only said, ‚ÄòShe (me) always said hi to all the customers and is very friendly to everyone.‚Äô Lisa approached me after Terri left and questioned me about Terri. Like, how long have Terri and you been talking and how have Terri and you got so close? I quickly told Lisa I barely talked to Terri and told her I said hi to Terri and asked for approval of shift cover. Lisa quickly turned away to return to whatever she was doing before Terri showed up.

I soon find out after Terri situation, that Lisa is being trained to be an assistant manager for the coffee place in the company. Lisa did tell me this but also told me she can‚Äôt be fully trained correctly because she started college. I don‚Äôt know why Lisa is telling me this since she knew I was planning to leave the company when I finished my bachelor's degree. I think she is trying to get a reaction from me but I don‚Äôt care if she becomes an assistant manager or not.

It has been about 5 months now since I started working at the coffee place with Lisa. I have honestly told Callie, that I don‚Äôt like working with Lisa. I did say to Callie that Lisa just me a weird aura and she just made me feel uncomfortable being around her, like she watching me. I did have another co-worker tell me that Lisa doesn‚Äôt like me and I told the co-worker ‚ÄòI already know that‚Äô since we were already talking about Lisa being trained to be an assistant manager and how her school is in her way. This co-worker told me I need to be careful when I talk about Lisa since she has a lot of friends at work. Why do I need to be careful when talking about Lisa? It is not like I talking about how bad of a worker she is or anything negative about her at work.

I concluded that Lisa hates me for the following reasons:

* Working more hours than her in the first month of working
* Making more money an hour
* Everyone at work like me including the high-up managers

I could be wrong about why Lisa hates me.

By: Gilliam Hall



Call me Mr. Screwed. For the duration of this tale, this title is accurate enough. I remember the night my life was derailed as though it were the last evening passed. I was sitting in the recliner in my apartment where I spent most of my free hours. Beer in hand I was grumbling, waiting for ‚Äúher‚Äù to finally show. She was always late. We were supposed to meet after I ended my shift at the factory, but as usual, she didn‚Äôt show. It was getting late and I was ready to give up on her. I told myself that many times.¬†

Several times I was ready to give up on her. We were not happy. She always acted as though she were desperate to prove her love for me, but just like every other pathetic attempt, she failed. Why did I stay with her? I guess I just didn‚Äôt want to give up‚Ä¶ again.

I finally wriggled my way out of the recliner and decided to call it a night. Perhaps sleep would rescue me for a pleasant change. My Doctor; Dr. Feelgood I often called him, prescribed me a stronger sleep aid as well as a med. to keep anxiety at bay. This barely worked to stop me from shouting at people. I walked into the bathroom for my usual night‚Äôs ritual of swallowing pills with a glass of tepid water and then turning in for the night. The new bottle of pills the doctor had given me was not where I thought they would be. They were nowhere to be found. ‚ÄúThat woman!‚Äù I thought to myself. ‚ÄúShe moves my stuff around like it is her home and never bothers to put it back‚Äù. Oh well, at least there was still a bottle of the old prescription with a few pills left in it in the back. I ignored the¬†

precaution labels about overdoses and women expecting children as usual.

One great gulp of water and fifteen minutes on the porcelain throne, and I was headed to bed. I stopped for one look in the bedroom mirror to remind myself how sorry I looked. Bloodshot and sleep-deprived eyes stared back at me. A person can only stand so much self reflection so I turned away to crawl into bed.¬†

Out of the corner of my eye, something seemed ‚Ä¶off. My reflection had not moved. It was still there, staring at me. It had a slight grin as though it knew something that I didn‚Äôt and it was about to tell, but it wasn‚Äôt going to make it easy. I gently slapped myself on the face just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt already asleep and dreaming. The slight pain was real. In the mirror, there was still no reflected movement. The mirror image of me just stood grinning and giggling at some hidden joke.

‚ÄúWhat are you laughing at?‚Äù I caught myself asking the nothing in front of me. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it obvious? I am laughing at you‚Äù It replied. My breath caught in my throat and I did not know how to respond to my reflection having a private joke about its owner. ‚ÄúDo you not recognize your reflection when you see it? Pal you seriously need to get in touch with yourself‚Äù It howled with laughter and looked at me as though I were a slow-witted child who didn‚Äôt understand his joke.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?‚Äù I asked, now obviously irritated by the cackling doppelganger. ‚ÄúWhat do I want?‚Äù he asked. Then his hand protruded from the mirror and beckoned me forward. I didn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt trust yourself? That has to suck!‚Äù I stepped closer and just then Me-2.0 reached out grabbed me by the shoulders and pulled me toward the mirror so hard that my head bounced off the glass and the dresser knocked me off balance. I fell to the floor, but not before I hit my head on the dresser and bloodied my nose. Through the twinkling stars in my eyes, I could see the other me laughing and still staring at me. ‚ÄúWhat I want is for you to get hold of yourself. You are a wreck. Your life is almost as miserable as you are and you are barely aware of it. I think it is time for you‚Ä¶ to meet you.‚Äù Another giggle escaped from the nightmare in the mirror. I grabbed one of the stone figurines of a bird, a gift from my mother, and smashed it into the mirror. Nightmare me fell into hundreds of small pieces on the dresser top and the floor. I bent down to pick up one of¬†

the pieces to see only my eye staring back, and then a mischievous wink. From another shard, I saw white flashing teeth behind that same secret smile. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt over Hot Rod! Not even close.‚Äù

45 minutes and three Tylenol later for my throbbing nose, I was headed back to bed. The sleep aids I took were working better than usual and within a few minutes, blackness engulfed me.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke to my evil alarm clock that had somehow been reset to the minutes just before midnight. I slapped the top where the God-sent off button was and rubbed my eyes. I could still get some sleep. I lay back again and rolled over yawning. As I opened my eyes I did not find an empty pillow or my girl asleep next to me. There was a gray figure lying there propped up on one elbow and staring at me expectantly. ‚ÄúWakey, wakey sleepy head!‚Äù came a voice like a child‚Äôs through a running window fan. It vibrated in my ear as though spoken from a whispering distance. I couldn‚Äôt make out his features. It made me think of a young man in his early 20‚Äôs, only seen through a bathroom mirror that has been steamed over by a long shower. He wore the¬†same mischievous, all-knowing grin as the reflection me did. ‚ÄúWe have a lot of work to do and only so much time to do it,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúGet out of my bed!‚Äù I shouted. ‚ÄúAs you wish Maestro!‚Äù came the playful vibrating voice. One instant he was in the bed, the next he was perched on the chest of drawers still watching me. I rose from the bed as though it were filled with venomous snakes and stood beside it rummaging under the bed for the baseball bat I kept there.

‚ÄúLooking for this?‚Äù Shade asked. I stood up quickly and the next thing I knew the bat was swinging at my head. I ducked out of the way and jumped over the bed, or at least nearly over the bed before my right foot caught on the edge and I tumbled out of control to the floor taking the sheets with me. There on the floor with sheets covering my head and wrapped around my foot, the mischievous Shade landed on my back and shouted ‚Äú I like this game!‚Äù and slammed the bat between my shoulder blades. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go for a ride horsey!‚Äù I had had enough at that point. I grabbed the thing's leg and twisted to lay on my back as quickly as I could and tossed the figure off of me along with the sheet¬†blocking my vision. He landed without a sound still standing there. The bat fell to the side of the concrete.¬†

Concrete? I looked around to find that we were standing in a deserted parking lot in front of an old grocery store. ‚ÄúWhere are we?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúBoy you catch on quick, don‚Äôt you Sparky?‚Äù he responded with a chuckle. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt recognize your old stomping grounds? The many hours you spent bagging groceries for little old ladies and women with screaming children? Of course, there were the few perks, such as the pretty little cashiers that you dreamed of dating.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand‚Äù I began to say before the front door of the grocery slid open and out walked a young man with a girl on his arm. I had to blink twice to make sure I was not hallucinating. At this point, it was preposterous to wonder if I was hallucinating now. The boy emerging from the building was the younger me. On my arm was none other than HER. The one that still makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs for the things she did to me. I still lovingly refer to her as ‚ÄúMonster‚Äù. Monster was the reason I stopped dating for years just to get away from women. This was our first date and we were headed for a restaurant. I don‚Äôt remember its name. I only remember the thoughts of passion and young ideas of romance blasting through my head while she spoke sweet words of promise and heated hints that made my ears burn. She was the first one I fell for. She was the one that turned me. ‚ÄúWhy are you showing me this Shade?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you recognize the smiling young face with that pretty young thing on his arm?‚Äù ‚ÄúOf course I do,‚Äù I said with a not-too-subtle hint of irritation. I was still wincing from the pain between my shoulder blades and my nose. ‚ÄúThe pain I caused you was nothing compared to what you felt a few years down the road because of her was it?‚Äù I had to agree. He wouldn‚Äôt catch me saying it out loud though, the annoying little freak. The parking lot around us suddenly fuzzed and faded out like an old Television with bad reception. When I could make out details again we were standing in the bedroom of my first apartment. A couple of years had gone by and I saw myself again. I was standing staring out the window at a stormy night. The storm matched the feelings I was fighting inside. Pain etched a map of my misery on my face. She was harsh, hateful, insulting, and controlling. I was constantly under attack by her poisonous tongue and hateful stares. I still loved her but I was on the verge of breaking. Tonight she had confessed that she had been flirting with another man and he had developed a crush. She swore she had no real feelings for him and it was only for fun, but it had led to a kiss and a few whispered promises. I saw the end coming like a deer sees the headlights of an approaching transfer truck. Like the deer, I was still too afraid and doubtful to move out of the way. This was the first time that I looked over my shoulder and Shade wasn‚Äôt smiling mischievously. He had only a serious look of concern. ‚ÄúThis is when the monster inside you was born.‚Äù I was struck like a bell with a steel hammer. ‚ÄúMonster! She was the monster!‚Äù Shade only gave a small sad smile. ‚ÄúAll those doubts and suspicions I was having about her were only proven true less than a week later. I gave her a second chance and she crushed me with it!‚Äù The shade paused for a moment as though remembering exactly what I was describing. He looked out the window at the rain and flinched at the thunder. The small smile came back and the mischievous glint in his eye returned. ‚ÄúPerhaps you need to see this from another point of view.‚Äù

The room flashed away again, a theatre curtain being drawn up out of sight to reveal the newly set stage before it. Monster was there on her bed crying, speaking to some unknown person on the phone. Through her sobs, I could just make out the words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why I did it. I only wanted him to fight for me like a man. I know I was wrong but I had to know. I treated him like a poorly trained dog, but I only did it because I was afraid,‚Äù Her mother, obviously, on the other end was whispering words of encouragement. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he will come back, Mom. I think this has been coming for a while.‚Äù I looked over at Shade and he was looking at the weeping girl on her bed. ‚ÄúI know right? What a monster!‚Äù He smiled viciously and clapped his hands together. A thunderous noise knocked me from my feet and when I rose again I was back in my bedroom. The rain that was falling that fateful night as I was looking from the window was still falling tonight, years later. I realized one of the raindrops on the window was a reflection of the tear falling from my eye. It was all her fault ‚Ä¶wasn‚Äôt it? I had held a grudge for years against all women. I believed that giving my heart to any other woman would only open me to more pain.¬† I became a coward and withdrew myself from any chance of falling into that trap. Perhaps the only way to avoid this was to find another, but not open myself to pain again.

Shade was gone but the mood he left me in clung to me like a death shroud. I looked over at the clock. There was still time to at least pretend to get some sleep. Though, even if I did it would only be full of nightmares. I resigned myself to going back to the living room and watching some TV alone with my thoughts. At least I thought I would be alone. There in the recliner with one foot propped on his knee waiting for me was another shade. This one was dressed in grays and was wearing a hooded jacket. Inside the hood, I could see a rubber mask of yet another maniacally grinning face. ‚ÄúWhy are you afraid to show your face as the other two did?‚Äù I asked the specter. ‚ÄúThe same reason you hide behind a grin and a joke my good man. Why let people see the pain and hurt inside? Cover it up with a disguise of happiness‚Äù He looked around the room as though looking for someone. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt you expecting a visitor tonight?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat business is it of yours Smiley?‚Äù I asked. He chuckled.¬† ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs my business alright. I‚Äôm in the business of busting your bubble!‚Äù He stood and walked around the room. There were only a few pictures and a flash of lightning illuminated one particular picture. It was the one that had not shown up for our date. In the photo, she was smiling at the camera. I did not take the picture. She never seemed to smile around me anymore. In the refrigerator were leftovers from her last attempt to impress me. She had cooked a meal that we both ate in silence. She only sat staring at me as though expecting me to say something, wanting me to say something. She wanted to hear how nice her dress looked, had she done something different with her hair? Who knows? Who cares? I didn‚Äôt, but I was looking out for number one. No more scars for me to heal.

Smiley came back to the recliner and peered down at the table with my old reading lamp. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this, a love note from your most recent romance?‚Äù I walked over to find a white folded paper written in her hand. On the outside was scribbled only ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù. I unfolded the paper and there was nothing more to read. Just like our relationship. ‚ÄúAnother one bites the dust I guess, huh partner?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt seems that way,‚Äù I said with little emotion. ‚ÄúBut hey,‚Äù he said‚Äù she will get over it won‚Äôt she? You did when you left Monster ‚Ä¶oh wait. You didn‚Äôt, did you?‚Äù I turned to face him with a questioning look on my face. Only slightly concerned. I said ‚ÄùWhat do you mean?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh nothing of course. I mean it‚Äôs not like she would do something stupid over you. That would be silly wouldn‚Äôt it? It would be almost pathetic.‚Äù Pathetic was a word I was using often lately in regards to my so-called relationship. That was when it occurred to me, the missing sleeping pills! ‚ÄúWhat did you do to her?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhoah partner!‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhat did I do to her?‚Äù¬†

I had to know. I raced around the room to find a rain jacket and only found the pink one she had left behind. I couldn‚Äôt find the car keys anywhere and that is when I lost what few marbles I had left. ‚ÄúTake me to her!‚Äù I demanded of Smiley. ‚ÄúAye, aye Cap‚Äôn‚Äù said he in a poorly executed pirate accent. He reached out and suddenly the air was sucked from my lungs. Lightening flashed and blinded me and suddenly I was on my back in the rain. I was looking up at the dark storm clouds and the falling rain when I remembered where I had wanted to be. I was on the roof of her building. Why he took me there God only knows! I jumped to my feet and ran to the door that led to the stairwell but found it locked. I couldn‚Äôt budge it! I ran to the edge to see if I could find a way down and that is when I saw the ambulance. It appeared to have been there for a while and there were men in blue uniforms moving as though there was no more hurry. A stretcher was being pulled out of the building by two burly men. On the stretcher was a still form covered from head to toe with a sheet. The form was female. I knew what it meant.¬†

There were other tenants gathered around outside. Some had umbrellas, others sharing the protection with their more prepared friends. There was one single man clinging onto the bed and following as though chained to it. Smiley snapped his fingers and suddenly we were standing next to the ambulance only feet away from the stranger holding onto the bed. He was crying. ‚ÄúNo! She has to be alright! Don‚Äôt take her!‚Äù he was screaming. The two burly men were forced to physically remove his gripping hands from the bed so that she could be loaded into the ambulance. He fell into the street sobbing and flailing. I had to know who he was and why her death was affecting him like this. I stepped up and offered my hand to him. He took it and stood. He faced me with a pained look on his face as though his world was just shattered. I asked, ‚ÄúWho is the woman under the blanket.‚Äù He took a few seconds to answer. ‚ÄúI loved her. She didn‚Äôt know but I was going to tell her. We met one day while we were both buzzing in to get to our apartments. She needed help with her groceries so I carried them in. She offered me a cup of coffee and we talked for a while. I knew then that I was in love. I was going to ask her to dinner until I heard her answering machine kick on. It was her asshole boyfriend. He was barking at her like a man at a child asking where she was and why she was late again.‚Äù Who would treat a beautiful woman like that?‚Äù Smiley shook his head in agreement. ‚ÄúYeah! What kind of monster would do that to the poor woman‚Äù said Smiley mockingly. The crying stranger acted as though he didn‚Äôt see Smiley and only stared at me waiting for an answer. I swallowed painfully and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Perhaps you should have saved her from him‚Äù The stranger walked off looking after the men with the stretcher and then all faded into gray again. I fell backward into my recliner. I was still wet from the rain and still stung from the words I had heard. ‚ÄúWhat kind of monster? ‚Ä¶Me. I‚Äôm the monster. I killed her‚Äù

I was alone again. The picture of my late girlfriend was still sitting face down from where Smiley had laid it. The note was still there, opened on the recliner. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I could at least go to the hospital and tell them what I know, say goodbye, and make sure her family was called. I found the missing keys in my dirty pants pocket and dressed myself as quickly as possible. I headed for the door. Just then, as though timed perfectly, there came a knock at the door. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three earth-shattering knocks muted the rolling thunder outside. Shaking I took the knob in hand but thought twice and looked out the window. I saw only a shadowed figure in a black derby hat and lightning flashes reflecting off of spectacles. ‚ÄúWh-Whose there?‚Äù I asked. I heard nothing. I hesitantly opened the door and there stood an old man stooped and frail beyond his years. He wore all black and decked out in rainwear. He had a cane designed to look like the body of a snake. The head curled up under his knobby hands. Around his neck was dark cloth. It was covering the spot where a scar would be on an injured larynx. He put his hand to his throat and rasped ‚ÄúWith me. Come.‚Äù Considering all I had been through tonight I was resistant. But perhaps the dream was over. This was one of her family members coming to greet me, but she had never mentioned a mute elderly uncle or grandfather. There was no humor to the man‚Äôs gaze as he stepped to the side, pointed to the stairs leading to the walkway out to the road, and only expected me to obey. I took a step forward coming in line with the man. He looked levelly into my eyes and glared. I walked onto the edge of the porch and stopped. I felt the butt of his cane connect with my lower back and push me with surprising force into the rain. I turned to grab the cane from him but he was gone, and so was my porch.

I was in another parking lot. There was no rain and from behind me, flood lights were casting shadows. I turned and found Old Man Raspy holding a door open waiting for me. We were entering a brick building and my first step into the building brought forth a smell that I was too familiar with. It was the medicinal smell of the place where people are stashed away until they give up their last breath. There were elderly people in wheelchairs and others on rolling beds being wheeled from room to room. This was the place I feared I would end up in my old age. Rotting alone and depressed in a hospital bed.

Old Man Raspy beckoned me to continue past the dead. They were only missing the headstones to proclaim them so. I followed him down two more halls until he finally stopped in front of a door. He turned to me and gestured. He didn‚Äôt need to speak. I understood ‚ÄúAfter you young man.‚Äù I knocked on the door and then came an answer. ‚ÄúGo away! I don‚Äôt need any more of your drugs woman!‚Äù The door opened slowly and there stood an old, beaten down, and angry ‚Ä¶me. He growled through artificial teeth that were stained yellow and he didn‚Äôt bother to close his robe over pale blue pajamas. He was hobbling on an old four-footed hospital cane. If I had to have a cane, couldn‚Äôt I at least have shown a little style like Raspy did? It didn‚Äôt occur to me how pointless that question was at the time. ‚ÄúI thought you were that God-forsaken nurse hear to peddle her poisons on an old man. What do you want!‚Äù I stalled, not knowing what to say. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve‚Ä¶.come to check the heating in here. Cold weather is coming friend.‚Äù He replied ‚ÄúFriend! I choose my friends carefully and I don‚Äôt recall you making the cut, son! But if you‚Äôre here to check the heating, be my guest.‚Äù He thrust his finger into the room. ‚ÄúIn and out boy,¬† don‚Äôt take too long.‚Äù He followed me in wheezing and coughing, paying no mind to the figure in black following me. I walked into a single room with little furnishing. There was a small table with a hospital issue reading lamp.¬† An open book lying face down on the bed. There,¬† also beside the bed was an empty medicine bottle and a single white piece of paper propped on the table as though positioned for someone to find. The elderly me had noticed where my eyes had strayed and hobbled over as quickly as he could to snatch the paper. I tried to stop him, but before I could he had knocked the table over and the note fell to the floor. A glass of water had fallen with it and made a puddle on the floor, slowly creeping toward the note with a single word written on it. I reached for it but the older me‚Äôs hand caught my wrist and then the earth shattered. It felt like I had been sucked into a funnel and forced into a container whose shape I didn‚Äôt recognize. Old age suddenly fell upon me and my bones began to ache with fatigue. I felt dizzy and disoriented as though drugged. I could suddenly recall my entire life leading up to that moment. I never found anyone else after the night of the suicide. I resigned myself to being the lonely murderer responsible for the death of an innocent. I never formed any other attachment to any human being and therefore grew old and feeble alone. No one visited me at the home. No one cared to. The only company I had was haunting memories of my self-induced misery. I felt as though my voice in the world was forever silenced. Through the dizziness and disorientation, it came to me, the elderly man with no voice. He had no voice in the world to be heard. They were all me. The playful young man with the mischievous smile, the man in grey with the grinning mask, and the elderly man with the cane and no voice were all different reflections of me. I was haunting myself. I reached over to pick up the piece of paper from the floor, now half-drenched in water. Written in the hand of a shaky old man was the word ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù. That was when the obvious meaning of the empty medicine bottle on the table hit home to me. I was dying. I began to choke. I fell onto the bed face-first and tried to catch myself but my body was not cooperating. Each free breath came slower and further between. The world was growing black and cold. ‚ÄúNo! No! This can‚Äôt be the end.‚Äù I thought. I looked up at Old Man Raspy. He looked back and with a simple one-handed gesture was waving goodbye. Lights out. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

I opened my eyes not knowing what to expect. Would the Grim Reaper be there to take my soul? God in his white robes greeting me in the world after, or perhaps the other one there waiting with chains in hand to drag me down into the Hell I was preparing for myself in life. None of those were what greeted me. I was staring up into my living room light. My hands were resting on my recliner arms. The TV was quietly playing an old movie based on a famous Charles Dickens novel. That seemed appropriate. I did just have the ‚ÄúDickens‚Äù scared out of me. When I realized I actually could laugh, I let it all out hysterically. I was alive! I stood up from the recliner and the clock overhead was blinking the time ‚Äú9:30 P.M.‚Äù Outside the window I could see dark clouds rolling, a coming thunderstorm. My breath caught in my throat. I looked down at the small table and there was the white paper with one word written on it. It seemed to take an eternity to turn, run to my keys, and dash for the door. But before I left I had to be sure. I went to the bathroom again and there on the counter was the empty spot where my medication should have been. I sprinted for¬†

the door and out to my car. At neck-breaking speeds, I drove to my girl‚Äôs apartment building. I couldn‚Äôt be too late. Please God no!¬† I made it to the front door of her building. I had to be buzzed in but just on the other side was a man heading up the stairs. I banged on the door and shouted for him to let me in. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an emergency!‚Äù He turned from the stairs and let me in. Then I recognized the man as the crying stranger from the previous night ‚Ä¶or the coming night. I sprinted past him up the stairs and headed for her apartment. Behind me, he was shouting ‚ÄúWait, what‚Äôs going on? Does someone need help?‚Äù Then it struck me. It was me she was trying to escape. I drove her to this. It was as though it were my own hands that had stolen the life from her in that nightmarish vision. Could I save her? Even if she survived this was there a chance of putting back together what I had shattered? No, but maybe a knight in shining armor could. I sprinted back down and landed in front of Mystery Man. I then began to tell the best lie I had ever told. ‚ÄúI was walking on the street down there and I looked up at the sky to see if it would start raining soon. I looked up and lightening flashed off of a window. I saw a woman there, in the window holding her hand to her throat as though she were choking and gasping. That was when I came to the door.‚Äù Someone‚Äôs got to help her. He had a fearful look in his eye and barely croaked the words ‚ÄúWhich window?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt was the fourth floor, the last one on the street side!‚Äù His face went white and pale and his feet started to move on their own. From midway up the stairs he shouted ‚ÄúI know who that is. I can get in. Call an ambulance!‚Äù I did as he asked. The ambulance came and found her with him. She had been saved by her secret love. He had made it just in time. Luckily he had some medical training and was able to keep her conscious. I was already gone. I was slowly making my way back home when I caught a reflection in a shop window. That didn‚Äôt make any sense because there was no one there to reflect. I stopped the car at the edge of the street and got out. I walked up to the window and greeted my reflection as an old friend. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I shatter you recently?‚Äù The grin was back on his face. ‚ÄúI told you that you should get in touch with yourself. I didn‚Äôt mean it literally.‚Äù In the reflection, I saw other reflections coming to join him. One was a younger man who had just been hurt. The next was an older man wearing a grinning mask, the other an elderly man with a cane and a black cloth tied around his neck. They all nodded a greeting to me and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, it looks like it's time to say goodbye to all of this don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù said my reflection. I now mirrored his impish smile and spotted a conveniently placed post with a heavy base used to string up the red rope around a theatre entrance. I picked it up and wielded it like a mace. I noticed the mischievous grin in the reflection this time was truly my own. The old man with the cane tilted his hat in a silent goodbye and winked behind his rain-streaked spectacles. With all my strength I smashed the post into the window and shattered my nightmare.

I felt a strong but feminine hand grab my arm and pull me back from the collapsing window. I tripped and fell on top of the figure behind me and dropped the post. I rolled off and heard a sultry female voice say ‚ÄùMay I ask what you think you're doing?‚Äù I finally made it back to my feet and turned around to meet the heated blue gaze of a woman in uniform. ‚ÄúOfficer Grace‚Äù her badge proclaimed her. The rain was soaking her red curls under her cap and doing interesting things to her uniform that fit her well enough to show voluptuous curves. ‚ÄúWhat am I doing? Well, I guess I‚Äôm killing my old man.‚Äù In retrospect, that may not have been the smartest thing to say to an angry police officer, beautiful or not. But as the old saying goes, I lived happily ever after with an arresting beauty at my side keeping me in line.¬† ",1,1728952525.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False

They lived together and she was heartbroken so I told her to move in with me and I would help her get back on her feet. 

I love her but she started pranking me a lot after she moved in. We used to play pranks on each other as kids but it‚Äôs gotten out of hand. She‚Äôs constantly moving my stuff around so that I can‚Äôt find it. I‚Äôll throw my keys on the coffee table and the next morning it will be in the pantry.

A few weeks after she moved in she started messing with my car. She puts the volume all the way up so that when I pull up music it blasts through the speakers. She did it every day for weeks before she stopped. 

There‚Äôs other things she does but these have bothered me the most. 

I want her to stop because it‚Äôs no longer funny but I also know she‚Äôs having a rough time right now and that she‚Äôs probably just trying to relive our childhood. AIO?",1,1728952330.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I'm 27F, and had my gallbladder removed and an ERCP on Aug 14. They only found sludge, and what triggered it was 2 gallbladder attacks within a week that felt like heart attacks (with constant pain between the two attacks). I never had issues until then. 

About a week ago out of the blue I started having intense chest pain with a feeling of heaviness and slight difficulty breathing. This led to a series of panic attacks, which I chalked up to anxiety. But days later I was still havig the pains, so I went to the ER. They tested me for heart problems and for blood clots, and everything came back normal. They gave me an NSAID and sent me home. 

It's been a week now and I still have this pain on and off. Tonight I've had an awful ""attack"" again that feels like I'm dying. This is almost as bad as the gallbladder attacks. 

Please tell me this goes away. I'm desperate and mourning my old life. I never had issues until suddenly in August and now I feel like my life will never be the same. 

Background: I did eat right before this most recent ""attack"". I can't remember for the other ones, the first one that happened all I would've had was coffee as it was in the morning.

We always look forward to breakfasts on Sunday mornings. It's a ritual at our house of having ""Pancake Sunday."" Either cinnamon, buttermilk  or blueberry - my favorite. 

My sister is the chef in the family. I always ask her exactly what she does: how she allows whatever batter she makes rise, so those pancakes are full, fluffy and light inside but still have those nice brown slightly crisp edges. 

She is really fussy. I make sure I compliment her every week on her cooking, and every little touch that she adds. That's only right, and she loves hearing it. It makes her happy.

With some light syrup, some nice hot coffee, hazelnut coffee mate, and a sugar substitute, it makes for a really satisfying breakfast.

1g3v2uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1g3v2uj/how_do_you_know_if_a_relationship_is_worth/,How do you know if a relationship is worth continuing anymore?,"Me (26f) and my bf (26m) have been dating for 4.5 years, met as friends in college and started dating our senior year. We have been through a lot together just growing as individuals in our early 20s during our relationship. We survived long distance early on in our relationship and we even started talking about marriage a couple years ago. We agreed it definitely wouldn‚Äôt be until after I finish grad school since I wanted to get settled with my career first. We both want kids and to start a family, talked about getting engaged/married by 30, and have always envisioned our lives together. Fast forward to now, I am 7 months away from graduation, turning 27 soon, and feeling uncertain about the future. 

There‚Äôs a few things, but for some context on what‚Äôs been going on, essentially my bf has been struggling with his career decisions for the past couple years. He started a job right after graduation that required him to move across the country, so we did LDR for a year before he quit and moved back home to his parents house. He was super depressed at his job, felt unfulfilled, and it was also really hard for him to be away from everyone he knew especially during peak covid. He was unemployed for almost a year, then landed another job with a different company in the same industry and decided to give the industry another try. He tried his best at this company, but started having some of the same issues and feelings he was having at his previous job on top of major leadership changes which ultimately led him to leave this one as well in Nov 2023. 

After quitting in Nov 2023, he was unemployed again and this was probably the time he felt the lowest. He was frustrated and felt embarrassed that he didn‚Äôt have it figured out, and his parents were also pressuring him and not giving much support (we both have strict immigrant parents with high expectations). He had expressed to me that he doesn‚Äôt know if he can give me everything I want in the future or that I deserve more than what he has to offer. This really stuck with me and this was the first time we ever discussed the possibility of breaking up, and I could tell he was feeling defeated about where he was in life. I tried my best to comfort him and told him I had too much love for him to just end it like that. I expressed how much I appreciated everything he‚Äôs done for me because he really does do so much for me. I have emotionally supported him through all of this and was always there for him whenever he was struggling. Never did I think about leaving him just because he didn‚Äôt have his life figured out, most people in their 20s don‚Äôt anyway. And I did communicate all of this to him when he was feeling his lowest. Fast forward a couple months, he decided to work as a barista while he figures out exactly what he wants to do and he‚Äôs currently in the same position now. He enjoys what he does and actually has a huge passion for coffee, but obviously also wants something higher paying and more stable. He is well educated and has great professional experience that is just not being put to use. He has decided to apply for MBA programs, and I supported this decision too if that‚Äôs what he wants to do.

Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling he just wants to give up on our relationship. There have been a few times where he‚Äôs suggested I expect too much from him and that everything he does seems wrong. This came about when I told him it‚Äôd be nice if he cleaned up after himself more frequently since we have a place together. Granted, I probably could‚Äôve communicated it in a nicer way. He‚Äôs told me I could be better at the way I say certain things to him to not make it seem like I‚Äôm nagging or ungrateful. He says he gets enough shit from his parents so that‚Äôs why he feels that way. I‚Äôve taken this into consideration and have definitely worked to improve on this. 

More recently, he did something that really made me upset, and I‚Äôm trying to decide if this is deep enough to consider leaving someone. I won‚Äôt get too much into it but I caught him in a lie about something, I gave him many opportunities to tell the truth, but he continued to lie and I don‚Äôt think he would‚Äôve told the truth if I had not admit to him I already knew. He coughed it up to his trauma with his parents and feeling the need to lie to them about small things because he was afraid of how they would react and says that‚Äôs why he lied. He has never given me a reason not to trust him but I feel this instance was just disrespectful to our relationship. He knows what he did was wrong and has apologized but I just couldn‚Äôt get over why he did what he did. We argued about it and every time I was expressing how upset I was, he just apologized and kept asking how I wanted to move forward. He‚Äôs been saying things like ‚Äúidk why you‚Äôre still with a guy like me‚Äù or will turn it around and say ‚Äúmy concerns are always ignored but you want me to change for you‚Äù. 

From my perspective, it just seems like he is so easily willing to throw away an almost 5 year relationship every time something is brought up. Is it worth it anymore? I care about him deeply and truly thought I found my person and lifelong partner. But am I compromising? Do I wait and ride it out with him to see where he‚Äôs at in another year? I don‚Äôt have any particular rush to get married, but I do have traditional immigrant parents who want to know I‚Äôm taken care of. He has brought a lot of joy and support to my life and it‚Äôs hard for me to imagine a future with anyone else. 

TL;DR Bf of 4.5 years is struggling with what he wants to do with his career after trying two different companies in the same industry and feels stuck. I am graduating with my masters in 7 months and will have a stable job in the medical field. What our future looks like together no longer looks certain, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone‚Äôs been through something similar. Do you end it or do you wait and hope it‚Äôll all work out?

I remember that in passing around to the left of the line on the 21st, a soldier, recognizing me, said in rather a low voice, but yet so that I heard him, ""Hard tack."" In a moment the cry was taken up all along the line, ""Hard tack! Hard tack!"" I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever since the arrival of the troops in building a road over which to supply them with everything they needed. The cry was instantly changed to cheers. By the night of the 21st all the troops had full rations issued to them. The bread and coffee were highly appreciated.‚Äù

# SAO - (1-3)

\[*They call me ‚ÄòAkuma‚Äô which means ‚ÄòDevil‚Äô in their tongue. To many cultures, it would practically mean the greatest of evils, that he is what they need to slay and be rid of in order to create a better world. In Japan, it means another supernatural race that lives alongside them other than their fellow humans. ‚ÄòYokai‚Äô is a catch-all term, and they were no better or worse than other demons and monsters.*

*Since ancient times, the people of Japan have always been closest to death. They personify many natural phenomena, with natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, or twisters as great beings of power like gods.*

*And one does not become pinned on a whim with such an affiliation without its influence.*\]

Kurenai watched a sparrow chirping among trees, as he too rested on a bench nearby.

*Bright flashing light that blinds him.*

He waited as the clouds rolled by, the sun ever present on his face. The wind picked up, bringing the ever chilling breeze of winter with it. Icy, and twitching.

*Tumbling, he felt himself pressed tightly against a surface.*

The water droplets that fall from a thawing icicle hit a small puddle that it made on the ground.

*Rolling, the line snapping as soon he was upside down, hitting against hard cushions.*

His mind was blank, and there it remained. He held a book in his hand, on a page that he has not flipped to change.

*Cras-!!!*

‚ÄúKurenai-kun!‚Äù

‚Ä¶Until a familiar voice called out to him.

Kurenai blinked as all the past memories caught up to him, bringing his hands to rub his eyes from sleeping sand before shifting his head, and watched as his long-time childhood friend walked over. He stood up as Itami reached him.

He and Itami are roughly about the same age, being twenty-five at the year 2015. Itami had, like many other citizens of Japan, black hair and brown eyes. He was well-kept, but in recent times he was beginning to grow a stubble, most noticeably on his chin. Itami‚Äôs voice was more pleasant and jovial than his had been in such recent times.

Ignoring all other weirdness, the main difference between them was that Kurenai was a lot taller.

‚ÄúItami-kun.‚Äù He greeted him back, kindly with a smile. ‚ÄúHow did you know it was me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho dresses up like you while reading a book?‚Äù He answered as he took his book mark and slotted onto his page.

‚ÄúOut here in the park again, huh?‚Äù Itami asked.

Kurenai nodded to his question, which led to his next question. Seeing his blank face, Itami had a good guess as to Kurenai‚Äôs mood.

‚ÄúStill thinking about it?‚Äù He questioned.

‚ÄúNot as much as I used to.‚Äù Kurenai answered softly, as his eyes watched the sparrow leave from sensing Itami‚Äôs presence.

The two began walking as he allowed himself to be easily seen once more. A type of technique that allows those specially trained in infiltration to move practically unseen.

‚ÄúAlthough, the thought still scares me.‚Äù He admitted.

‚ÄúAkuma, being scared of his otouto?‚Äù Itami teased with a grin, both in trying to brighten the mood and the change of subject. ‚ÄúWho would‚Äôve thought that we would need a seven year old kid to handle you?‚Äù

Kurenai chuckled and gave a wry smile. ‚ÄúAfter Sofu, I could never have guessed that I would have to face off another member of my family.‚Äù

Kurenai exhaled, as he cracked his neck. ‚ÄùAnother of my greatest challenges yet. Perhaps some of those prophecies from your manga are true?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo long you weren‚Äôt blanking.‚Äù Itami smiled. ‚ÄúWhat were the words of your Sofu? That very cool line, something like military leaders would say.‚Äù

‚ÄúHai.‚Äù Kurenai nodded. ‚Äú‚ÄòHesitation is defeat‚Äô, just before we left to enlist‚Ä¶‚Äù

Kurenai sighed as his head hung low. Itami, seeing the state of his friend, elbowed his side. ‚ÄúOi.‚Äù

‚ÄúItai! (Ouch!)‚Äù The hit made Kurenai flinch as he rubbed his side. ‚ÄúHai?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain they‚Äôll welcome you back with open arms.‚Äù Itami reassured him. ‚ÄúYour family is a lot better off than mine was.‚Äù

Kurenai‚Äôs eyes hardened for just a moment, from learning after his challenge with Isshin, of Itami‚Äôs circumstances. They softened for his old friend as he nodded with a smile. He, Itami, reasoned enough that he didn‚Äôt desire to drag others in the conflicts of his family. Though he agreed, it wasn‚Äôt really fair for him.

In the times where they had gotten to unwind, where his guard was mostly down that had gotten Kurenai privy to the events. Itami‚Äôs circumstance was that of an abusive father, his childhood being that of an alcoholic that he gained from the circumstance of a difficult time, and when there was about to be an economic depression with the rising rent.

The man was all around a bad father, but there was once a time where he was a good husband. The man‚Äôs life ended prematurely, just when he had gone too far. The very incident that led to Itami‚Äôs mother killing her husband in order to defend herself. When the news came, being shocked was a rather understatement to his close friend.

Itami‚Äôs experience with his father was nothing good, so not much had been lost to the drunkard‚Äôs sad demise. Yet, his mother had another viewpoint. There was disbelief in what she had done to him, then disbelief slowly became disheartening, disheartening became grief, grief became regret. Over the years, her mental health deteriorated where she became delirious, in that she believed that her husband was still alive and she began talking to nothing but air.

Five years after the fact, when Itami had to convince her to face reality, she tried to kill herself. Or in other words; commit suicide by a ritualistic sacrifice by self-immolation, which was stopped by Itami himself.

That was on the day just before he fought his grandfather, and had officially turned eighteen.

It was a cruel thing. Knowing that while he had been achieving what was his own success, his friend was facing a depressing trial all on his own. Matters after that didn‚Äôt help when he too, got slapped by the reality known as life. Aoi and Yukito, his mother and father of this respective world, perished when a truck slammed into them when they had gotten on a quick little trip.

‚Ä¶He was the one who convinced them to go out‚Ä¶

He didn‚Äôt think his will would shatter so easily, staying home with Kazuto for as long as he could. Like any good friend would, Itami helped around and supported him from the loss. Even if he was ordered to have him brought back so that he could continue training.

He would only know of what had happened to Itami himself, after accidentally getting him drunk on drafted beers that made him spill what he had kept hidden.

Something he kept hidden very well.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right.‚Äù Kurenai conceded, seeing his friend‚Äôs point. ‚ÄúThanks for getting me out of my funk just now.‚Äù

He elbowed Kurenai, softer this time. ‚ÄúWhat are friends for?‚Äù Itami recited the words he felt the most about all those years ago.

‚ÄúAfter we get back, you‚Äôre heading to their home?‚Äù He asked curiously.

‚ÄúHai.‚Äù Kurenai nodded with a confirmation. ‚ÄúOji and Oba took otouto in. I sent money to them to help raise him over the years.‚Äù

‚ÄúI talked with Kazuto whenever I had time on the phone. He had trouble speaking any words, but now since I‚Äôm on the reserves, I finally can get back home. I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôll remember me. It‚Äôs been a long time since we saw each other face to face.‚Äù

Another thought crossed his mind. ‚ÄúSpeaking of family. How‚Äôs Risa-chan?‚Äù Kurenai asked.

Hearing his question, Itami couldn‚Äôt help but sigh exhaustively. ‚ÄúAll of her messages are all about food.‚Äù

‚ÄúBusy girl, isn‚Äôt she?‚Äù Kurenai chuckled. ‚ÄùI couldn‚Äôt believe you had gotten married before training. Just what kind of luck is that?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyone catch your eye?‚Äù Itami asked, in a hope to change the subject of discussion.

To Itami‚Äôs surprise, Kurenai went along with it. ‚ÄúNo. My nickname from middle-school stuck with me through all of my life.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, there were some. Some of them had done it on dares by their friends.‚Äù He informed him. ‚ÄúSome were nice, but I didn‚Äôt continue with any of them.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that being?‚Äù He asked for more context.

‚ÄúI am not a delinquent.‚Äù Kurenai muttered slowly. ‚ÄúSofu is a policeman. I would rather die than know that he is on my case.‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh? Didn‚Äôt he retire?‚Äù

Kurenai shot Itami with the stink eye. ‚ÄúHe took a knife to the eye, and he still beat up the man who took it while in his elderly years. Are you telling me, you want to face off against someone who is that stubbornly determined to cuff you in jail? He refused to head into the hospital until he locked the guy up.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid‚Ä¶ He‚Ä¶ N-uhh‚Ä¶ Oh‚Ä¶‚Äù Itami‚Äôs face paled as he realized the implication. ‚ÄúMakes me kind of glad that I am friends with you.‚Äù

Kurenai agreed with a nod. ‚ÄúHai. I am glad he is my Sofu. Makes me wonder why he wasn‚Äôt in a higher ranking position. His name is revered enough to make a man pause. Now with his eyepatch, he‚Äôs easily identifiable. No one else can go strutting around like he can.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù Itami looked at Kurenai‚Äôs pause. His eyes were looking up to the sky. ‚ÄúWondering‚Ä¶ Of what I should get for them.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is it for?‚Äù He asked for confirmation.

‚ÄúWell, obviously for the kids.‚Äù Kurenai answered, as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. ‚ÄúBut also for Oba and Oji. I know Sofu would like expensive sake.‚Äù

Itami hummed. ‚ÄúSo, for the entire family.‚Äù

‚ÄúI would like to.‚Äù Kurenai agreed. ‚ÄúThough, regular gifts are expensive. I want to give them all something to show my gratitude.‚Äù

His head shakes dejectedly. ‚ÄúBut I am running into a brick wall.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we have a couple of hours before you reach their house.‚Äù Itami informed him. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll think of something.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo hentai.‚Äù He added with a pointed finger.

Hands immediately went to grab the scruff of his shirt before he was pulled down, and was forced to stare into a pair of brown eyes. ‚ÄúJust who do you exactly take me for?!‚Äù Itami screamed, incensed.

Kurenai smiled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre an otaku.‚Äù He replied.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt poke at my hobby man.‚Äù He huffed as he released his shirt from his grasp.

Kurenai gave a small laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just forbidding the adult material. Who knows what you had hidden beneath your bed?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know.‚Äù Itami huffed. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you drew me out with something like that...‚Äù

*It was High-Alert in the garrison of Japan‚Äôs Special Forces Group-bootcamp. They were doing a special exercise of what is known as, ‚ÄòHide-&-Seek‚Äô. Otherwise known by the official term as, Escape & Evasion-Training.*

*It was the end of the exercise when they began the roll-call. It had been a long time since Kurenai‚Äôs name had been called, as had everyone else‚Ä¶ Except for one.*

*‚ÄúYouji-san!‚Äù The instructor called out a repeated number of times.*

*‚ÄúYouji-san!‚Äù Another member of the SFG yelled aloud as they went through the forest.*

*‚ÄúYouji-san!!‚Äù A close acquaintance spoke out with them.*

*‚ÄúYouji-san!!!‚Äù They heard the instructor called out once more.*

*‚ÄúKuso.‚Äù Cursed the instructor. ‚ÄúAt this rate, we‚Äôll be late for dinner.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúSensei!‚Äù A voice called out to the instructor as he turned to face them.*

*It was Kurenai, who looked to have ran a sprint marathon, if he were to judge them by the heated breath that could be seen in the puffs out in the cold air. He carried a box beneath his arms as he ran to them. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got just the thing!‚Äù*

*The instructor and the rest of the SFG recruits watched as Kurenai ripped the tape off from the cardboard box and held up a small book for all to see.*

*‚ÄúItami-kun!‚Äù Kurenai shouted. ‚ÄúI got the next volume of Naruto! It shows Madara fighting the Shinobi Alliance!‚Äù*

*‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt come get it now, I‚Äôll burn it and-Wah!!!‚Äù*

*Kurenai cried as he was suddenly tackled from behind by a green humanoid blur.*

*The origin of that green blur had come from a camouflage cardboard box that blended really well with the surroundings of the forest.*

Kurenai chuckled as he looked at Itami, whose face was full of embarrassment at the memory.

‚ÄúYou fought tooth and nail for that volume.‚Äù His head shook in reminiscence. ‚ÄúThat was a good time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere everyone was very wound-up tight. They didn‚Äôt have fun like we had.‚Äù Itami muttered beneath his hands.

‚ÄúHai.‚Äù Kurenai agreed. ‚ÄúI was surprised you were able to convert them to otaku-hood, as lazy as you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat was only after you showed up with the manga box.‚Äù Itami added. ‚ÄúWithout that, not many would have given it a try.‚Äù

‚ÄúMmn.‚Äù Kurenai grunted in confirmation.

Both arrived at a station and catched up on a train ride.

The two sat together as the bullet train zoomed. Itami, focusing on a gaming app on his phone while Kurenai stared at the outside from the window. Watching the sea of trees before the ocean itself came into view.

\[*A minority of people could look beyond the name. Fewer people could still accept such a person privately instead of out among their communities. Lesser are those who aren‚Äôt bothered by such a reputation as my best friend ‚ÄòItami Youji‚Äô was.*

*The two of us have been through thick and thin when we first met in our childhood, and through our training in the military. The man supported me after the loss of my parents, even after what he had gone through. Much like me, people had viewed him to be very sub-par compared to others, not knowing that beyond his laziness and interest that he was wholly competent once he was sufficiently motivated.*¬†

*And as he taught me the greater joys of life beyond my parent‚Äôs passing, I taught him my skills in giving someone the beatdown of their life.*

*Who knew just how priceless the things we shared with each other would benefit us in so many ways?*\]

+-+-+

Souffle pancakes. That‚Äôs what he decided on.

Something light and fluffy, but also with toppings of strawberries and jam. It was a nostalgic taste of his, something which they had gotten for his birthday without fail.

He wasn‚Äôt sure if it was the best choice, but he wouldn‚Äôt doubt that there wasn‚Äôt a person on the planet who didn‚Äôt like pancakes. Still, this was to be treated as a momentous occasion. Where he returns home. It wouldn‚Äôt be long enough to where he had to participate in airborne training with Itami after their break. Just because he was on the reserve didn‚Äôt mean he was meant to slack off.

Although, he had wondered if he should have called ahead?

He made it to his family‚Äôs home. It was still the same address, and the same house when he went to knock on the front.

Answering the door was a young girl. Black hair that had been tied up into twin-tails, and dark gray eyes stared at him with youthful wonder. She was wearing blue kid shorts and a striped orange-white shirt dress.

Unless Midori and Minetaka had another girl he was unaware about, he knew exactly who she was. He felt happy inside, as if something broken is slowly mending again after years of inactivity. He gave her a grin at her presence.

‚ÄúKonnichiwa, Sugu-chan.‚Äù Kurenai greeted her warmly. ‚ÄúDo you remember me?‚Äù

His young cousin stared at him for a few brief moments, before she started to move‚Ä¶

The door was slowly creaking closed, before she shut it, and a lock was turned‚Ä¶

Then he heard her scream behind the door‚Ä¶

‚ÄúKaa-san! Tou-san!! Wake up!!! There‚Äôs a very strange and dangerous looking girl at the front door!!!‚Äù Her rather loud yell reached even beyond the house. He wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if her lungs woke up the entire neighborhood, given how sound traveled.

‚ÄúEh?‚Äù ‚ÄúEh?!‚Äù ‚ÄúEeh?!‚Äù

Instant pandemonium ensued as he heard the kicking off of sheets and the heavy footfalls the signified running.

The door opened once more. ‚ÄúEh?!‚Äù ‚ÄúEeh?!‚Äù

‚ÄúEeto (Umm)‚Ä¶?‚Äù Kurenai muttered, a sweat drop trailing down the side of his head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a boy‚Ä¶‚Äù He corrected her.

+-+-+

‚ÄúGomennasai! Onii-san!!‚Äù His young cousin apologized to him, doing one cutesy bow to him that made him smile.

He had taken off much of his attire. His glasses were taken off, his scarf was brought down as well as his hood. His features were a lot more mature in age, but one feature stood out from his head, his rather long hair that trailed down from the side of his head. Hence, the mistaken *‚Äògirl‚Äô* comment.

The family had gathered and they were seated at a table. Midori and Minetaka were familiar faces to him. It was early morning, and their faces had yet to be properly refreshed. Despite their grogginess they wore smiles as they welcomed him inside.

Midori was the near perfect image of Aoi, so much so that he mistakenly thought his mother had come back to life. It was a near mistake if she wasn‚Äôt beside Minetaka whose hair was slicked back and wore glasses, and who obviously had very different features from Yukito that he would‚Äôve blundered.

Yet his attention was drawn to the two young faces of the family, which he could distinctly recall from their younger age. He knew of Suguha‚Äôs features already, but not quite to that of the newly arrived young boy.

Dark hair, black eyes, and a rather soft face of features that he could mistakenly make for a young girl himself. But he knew better than to misjudge his own brother who was wearing gray gym shorts and a rather simple black t-shirt.

Midori and Minetaka had just introduced him as one part of the family. Hence, the present situation.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, Sugu-chan.‚Äù He eased her worry. ‚ÄúYou were right to not let someone you didn‚Äôt know into your home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlthough, you should‚Äôve slammed the door and locked it so I wouldn‚Äôt have an easy time getting it. In fact, you should‚Äôve woken up haha and chichi so that they could answer the door instead of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhich begs the questions‚Ä¶‚Äù Minetaka interjected as he looked towards the two children. ‚ÄúHow was it that you were awake before us?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you two not go to sleep last night?‚Äù He asked.

The mother sighed as they saw two of the kids froze. ‚ÄúN-no, we did.‚Äù His brother, Kazuto answered.

‚ÄúThen why was the TV on, with it playing Doraemon?‚Äù Minetaka replied.

Kurenai could answer that they did call him early this morning, but he didn‚Äôt want to bury them deeper than the hole they dug.

He wouldn‚Äôt have gotten a chance either way. ‚ÄúAnata, Aoi-Nee‚Äôs musoko.‚Äù Midori quipped as she had gestured her head to his direction.

At the reminder, Minetaka showed himself to be a little flustered as he scratched his hair. ‚ÄúGomen, Kurenai-kun. Right after you just got back.‚Äù He apologized.

Kurenai just waved it off, as he really wasn‚Äôt bothered by what happened.

He only spoke the truth. But there was no reason to add that there were very easy ways to enter such a home if it wasn‚Äôt protected normally. This was a safe neighborhood however, so he wasn‚Äôt worrying about it too much.

Thinking it was any good of a moment, he settled the bag with packed breakfast on top of the table. ‚ÄúI brought food for the morning.‚Äù

Untying it and settling down upon were small boxes that could open up, revealing the treats within. The most verbal and expressful were obviously the two kids, their eyes filled with stars and had awed at the arrival.

‚ÄúOh? Pancakes!‚Äù Minetaka spoke in an enthusiastic tone.

‚ÄúYou bought this for us, Kurenai-kun? Oh-ho\~ You shouldn‚Äôt have!‚Äù Midori cheered. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs yours?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I already had one.‚Äù He answered. ‚ÄúI tried out some stuff to see what would be best to give all of you when I came home.‚Äù

That was a lie. He had only bought for the four of them, and he wasn‚Äôt hungry so he decided to be a little stingy and didn‚Äôt add himself in with the price. He wasn‚Äôt sure if his grandfather Isshin could eat it as well. He very much could, but probably doesn‚Äôt go down as fast as sake would.

As to the reason he lied? Well, he would assume that if his aunt was the same as his mother, then she wouldn‚Äôt make too much of a fuss if he already partook beforehand. No need to make trouble in having to share food with him right now.

‚ÄúItadakimasu!‚Äù They said before digging in.

Compared to the two adults who gave their respects to both the cook and him for bringing it, Suguha and Kazuto were already nearly done, it would‚Äôve been that bigger of a mess than it had been that type of food they were eating. But, it was alright for them as they were still kids, and that they were in the confines of their homes which didn‚Äôt need them to follow social etiquette.

For drinks; Midori had tea, Minetaka had coffee, while Suguha and Kazuto had ramune soda that he had gotten for a cheap-price of drinks-Orange and Grape, respectively-and for himself was a protein shake. Part-way through, his aunt looked towards his direction before beginning talking with him.

‚ÄúHow long would you be here, Kurenai-kun?‚Äù Midori asked curiously.

‚ÄúA few days to at least a week before leaving to do more courses.‚Äù He answered routinely to her. ‚ÄúSame as before, why?‚Äù

Midori nodded. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been recent displays of technology that I think you would be interested to see.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of tech would that be?‚Äù Kurenai‚Äôs eyebrow rose in response.

It was his younger brother who answered him. ‚ÄúThe next level of virtual reality.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe stuff we have now is more or less, just seeing through and using cyberspace.‚Äù Kazuto began informing him. ‚ÄúThe next big thing that is coming is that we‚Äôll actually be able to dive deep into it like the ocean. A totally new different type of space! Even haptic suits won‚Äôt really compare.‚Äù

‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶‚Äù Kurenai spoke in stunned admiration. He had been watching his younger brother who had barely spoken up. He knew the situation this might‚Äôve been for him, and he was prepared for all but the worst case in that Kazuto might not be able to open up. He had just dropped in unannounced, and neither of them had time to prepare or be ready.

Yet, it seems like the age of modern technology seemed to be his weakness. Games also seemed to be a favored topic as well when they switched to it.

‚ÄúV-R-M-M-O, eh?‚Äù Kurenai muttered, feeling at the acronym. ‚ÄúI can only imagine what it would be like, playing Warcraft or Final-Fantasy-Fourteen on that kind of system.‚Äù

‚ÄúIts development only really began a few years ago.‚Äù Midori interceded. ‚ÄúBut they made huge progress, and some of the equipment is rumored that they can be bought at their latest demo.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that safe?‚Äù He questioned, feeling a bit skeptical about it. ‚ÄúEven if it was tested, to sell experimental stuff like that just after the first version of their working product‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt isn't full-diving gear.‚Äù Midori clarified. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mostly goggles and headsets that work to prepare the brain for the foreign experience. I mostly want to get it because those who tested the prototypes said it was very therapeutic, and that it can help with your diet.‚Äù

‚ÄúDiet?‚Äù Minetaka spoke. ‚ÄúTsuma, you never looked a day younger.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh anata\~‚Äù His aunt swooned, as they held hands.

His eyes glanced over to the kids, specifically his younger brother as he made some gagging sounds. He didn‚Äôt let the bemusement inside of him show, but he was still joyful that his aunt and uncles were still flirting around like a young couple.

‚ÄúOnii-chan!‚Äù This resulted in him getting slapped on the back by his cousin, which made him wince, and who pouted at him angrily. ‚ÄúTou-san, Kaa-san, are ours. We barely get to eat breakfast together.‚Äù

Even with a mature response, his cousin couldn‚Äôt stop from the puffed up cheeks from forming into a pout.

Getting reprimanded by his cousin, Kazuto bowed his head towards his parental figures. ‚ÄúGomennasai, Otousan, Okaasan.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is alright, Kazu-chan.‚Äù Midori warmly said. ‚ÄúYou are obviously just not prepared for dealing with this type of stuff.‚Äù

Her attention was brought back to him once again. ‚ÄúIt starts tomorrow. Would you like to come along with us, Kurenai-Kun?‚Äù

‚ÄúI take it the entire family is going?‚Äù Kurenai asked.

To his mild amusement, it was Minetaka who nodded in confirmation. ‚ÄúThe kids have summer break, and just for tomorrow we‚Äôre using one of our days off. Kazuto and Midori will be there at the front of the exhibit, while Suguha and I will be at the stores and food court.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be a nice trip.‚Äù Kurenai nodded back with a grunt. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind tagging along.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs settled!‚Äù Aoi glowed, before something of a look made her blink as if in shock. ‚ÄúKurenai-Kun, did you have anywhere to stay around here? If you don‚Äôt, we can always make room.‚Äù

Kurenai shook his head, finding her worries amusing. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you worry about finding me a place to sleep, Oba-san. I have a place, so I‚Äôm well off.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell if you have that settled, I need to go prepare for work. Don‚Äôt want to be late now.‚Äù

With the pancakes already done, Aoi stands from her seat, maneuvering around the table as she hurries up the stairs to their second-story floor.

Minetaka then takes a look at Kurenai. ‚ÄúI can do my work from home unless necessary, but I have errands to run as well. Would you care to watch over Kazuto and Suguha?‚Äù

Kurenai nodded. ‚ÄúI can. I‚Äôll bring them over to visit my place.‚Äù

‚ÄúArigato, Kurenai-Kun. I won‚Äôt be long.‚Äù Minetaka thanked as he stood from the table.

‚ÄúTake your time, no rush, Otousan.‚Äù Minetaka paused as Kurenai replied, yet still he waved back as Minetaka went back up the stairs.

His gaze went back to the two kids as he looked towards them. Only finished halfway through the gift of food. ‚ÄúAfter you two finish and they‚Äôre done, you two can go get ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo we really have to go with you to your house?‚Äù Suguha asked him.

He nonchalantly shrugs at her question. ‚ÄúNot really. You don‚Äôt have to go with me, I know you‚Äôre not quite that comfortable with me yet. So, we‚Äôll go only whenever you want to.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have games over there?‚Äù His younger brother asked.

‚ÄúI can buy them.‚Äù Kurenai answered. ‚ÄúAnything you play on?‚Äù

‚ÄúComputer.‚Äù Kazuto quickly replied.

He nodded his head as he then looked back to his cousin. ‚ÄúWhat about you? You play on the computer as well?""

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù The very young Suguha hesitated. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you like to play games like your brother?‚Äù Kurenai reiterated.

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt play games, do you?‚Äù Kurenai guessed.

Before she could say anything else, Kazuto replied before she did. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù He answered.

‚ÄúOnii-Chan!‚Äù She shouted, obviously incense.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay! It‚Äôs okay!‚Äù Kurenai quickly interjected before anything more could‚Äôve been said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs stuff you‚Äôd want, we can easily order online.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like that.‚Äù Suguha said, easily taking the offer. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt play games a lot, I‚Äôve been busy practicing Kendo.‚Äù

‚ÄúKendo, huh?‚Äù He brought a hand to his chin, rubbing it in thought. ‚ÄúHow good do you think you are?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I only ever fought Ojii-san.‚Äù

‚ÄúAh.‚Äù He nodded his head in understanding. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs tough, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúVery tough.‚Äù Suguha nodded back before her eyes went wide. ‚ÄúWait, you fought him?‚Äù

He couldn‚Äôt help but keep a wide grin on his face. ‚ÄúI beat him.‚Äù

This time, the two kids looked at him with awed expressions. This made him feel very boastful. ‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt start out like that, but I won against him just before I turned eighteen. It was a very happy moment in my life.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long did you train for?‚Äù His younger brother asked.

An easy answer. ‚ÄúWhen I was training it was for nine years and three months until I could actually match him, but even then I never stopped.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you join in the tournaments?‚Äù Suguha asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, and Ojii-san already has that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Kazuto questioned.

‚ÄúIn order to train, we have to have special shinais‚Äô in order to handle with our strength. I can get it to the point where I don't break things anymore.‚Äù

He makes a wincing face as he taps his own shoulder with two fingers. ‚ÄúNot to the point where I still break what‚Äôs under the bogu. So for everyone‚Äôs safety, I am not in it.‚Äù

His strength was prenaturally strong for someone of his age, and it only grew larger with his training for things beyond normal humans, it made it very much so that he couldn‚Äôt feasible enter in a place that doesn‚Äôt come out of two outcomes: Breaking things, or breaking someone.

Military training for special forces certainly didn‚Äôt help in that regard. He didn‚Äôt learn so much how to hold back, but it taught him how to correctly apply all of that power into a skill of pinning it into one point.

‚ÄúSo I won‚Äôt be able to practice with you then?‚Äù Suguha asked.

‚ÄúNot very so-‚Äù

Suddenly, like a lightbulb being hit by lightning, a thought lights up and strikes him. *'That may work‚Ä¶'*

He nods his head. ‚ÄúYou have your own gear?‚Äù

She nods her head. ‚ÄúOjii-san gave me one.‚Äù

He smiled at her. ‚ÄúThen let‚Äôs head out to the dojo.‚Äù He looked at Kauzto. ‚ÄúYou want to watch?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure!‚Äù

**+-+-+**

After saying farewell to misses and mister Kirigaya, they had swiftly geared up within the dojo to practice in. It was their nearby small dojo, and fortunately as such, they were the only ones within it.

‚ÄúLet me see what you learn.‚Äù He part asked, part ordered as he got into his stance.

It wasn‚Äôt a fight, or even a spar. This was just something to be tested.

Same as how it‚Äôs been done to him, and it was folly to think a person would need to go all out.

What was given to him wasn‚Äôt anywhere crazy, but Suguha was a very good kendo. Her wrist don‚Äôt ever cross when they don‚Äôt need to be, the grip she holds on her weapon could slide off an on for quick deflections and her footwork made her so that any strike that still could‚Äôve touched her was too far. She ought to be when training under their grandfather.

What they‚Äôre doing wasn‚Äôt trying to tag each other. He was finding a rhythm and flow to see how well she can respond.

He swung to the left, and their shinais knocked into each other.

He swung to the right, and the simple swing was parried to where he could‚Äôve faced a stick to the head, not before beating it away.

That act made Suguha blitzing past him, which allowed him the opening he could take to capitalize on her mistake. He wasn‚Äôt gonna do such things yet. She still has an awkward grip and posture on her weapon, and he‚Äôd allowed her a grace period before correcting it. It‚Äôll be easier for her to handle once she grows up and her fingers could easily wrap around it.

His method being a bit unorthodox as he didn‚Äôt just flat out told her. Once the grace period he had given her was up, that‚Äôs when it all began. Feet too close together? A tap against the thigh to have them spread them apart. An arm acting as a chicken wing? A hit down on the elbow made her straight.

Is the back itself not straight? It didn‚Äôt touch, but when she attempted an overhead cut his tip of his shinai was about poking her head. He moved forward and didn‚Äôt stop, which made walk and lean back as she did. The tip of her own shinai hit the wall behind her first way before her back did. The way that she held her sword was almost a lateral line instead of horizontal.

In this small frame of time, he was getting out from where a lot of beginners were struggling.

It wasn‚Äôt the only thing that he was fixing.

*‚ÄòThis works‚Ä¶‚Äô*

Strange as it was to think, he did need to learn how to rein in his strength. If he knew himself as well as he did, then his body would be instinctively holding himself back from hurting her. If he continues doing this, then he can teach himself now with a conscious effort towards everyone else. There may be a time where he would need to take someone unharmed, and they‚Äôre not gonna have this safety-net.

An hour passed. What started off as an easy test became a near grueling workout, it was quite impressive for one so young to do.

Suguha‚Äôs good, but he‚Äôll have to keep working with her in order to ingrain the fundamentals. Otherwise, all such practice they did today would be forgotten.

‚ÄúAlright that‚Äôll be it for today.‚Äù He called to her to stop. Making her go slack as she heaved tiredly. ‚ÄúHow do you feel?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike‚Ä¶ I just‚Ä¶ Ran a marathon‚Ä¶‚Äù She panted between breaths.

‚ÄúI grabbed some water for you two.‚Äù They heard Kazuto speak as he came over. In his hands were two large bottles of water.

‚ÄúOh! Arigato, Otouto.‚Äù

‚ÄúArigato, Onii-chan.‚Äù

Kurenai accepted as he went down to sit against the wall. The contents within were quickly emptied as he took off his men. ‚ÄúYou did great.‚Äù

‚ÄúBah!‚Äù She looked at him just about when she was about to take a sip. ‚ÄúYou really think so?‚Äù

He nodded, Kazuto doing the same as well. Said compliments made her preen brightly.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got the talent.‚Äù Kurenai responded before looking at his younger brother.

‚ÄúAnything *you* want to do?‚Äù This got him a thoughtful hum, as his brother took the time to think of a place. Eventually, he came to an answer.

**+-+-+**

‚ÄúNever thought I‚Äôd see this thing again, I thought they got discontinued‚Ä¶‚Äù

He was in awe, the feeling of nostalgia filling him as he stared at the machine. It was a rather big sizable one, and it was suited for climbing and operating the controls within. The seating pod was like that of a giant marble, surrounded with reddish-orange tinted glass.

A joystick controls each on either side of the seat‚Äôs armrests. Said pod was on an apparatus that would move in the direction by the controls, and what was shown on screen. The newest addition that he‚Äôd not seen before would be the headsets that were overhanged in the pod.

It was both augmented and virtual reality in the basic sense.

‚ÄúHave you played this game before?‚Äù Kazuto asked him with a voice that suggested newfound curiosity.

‚ÄúBack in 2003.‚Äù He replied as he scanned over the machine he hadn‚Äôt seen since his childhood. ‚ÄúOtou-san would have me on his lap as we played this. He wasn‚Äôt really good at dogfighting, but it was something I would never forget.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think you could do that?‚Äù Kazuto asked, easily flowing the topic into the subject.

He wouldn‚Äôt know what his younger brother was thinking, but asking him, a person he wouldn‚Äôt really know, had to take a lot of courage. He could barely ask that with his own father, nevermind knowing how old he really was.

Or he might not just have minded it. There are some things that people will allow children to get away with, for better or worse. This wasn‚Äôt any minor issue.

‚ÄúUmu!‚Äù Was the easy answer. ‚ÄúDo you want to give it a try too, Sugu?‚Äù

The young girl shook her head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if three could fit. That‚Äôd be dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe.‚Äù Kurenai climbed inside. ‚ÄúThis thing was one of the first simulator pods, so it had a lot of redundancies to prevent it from tipping over.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not sure we can try after Kazuto‚Äôs turn.‚Äù He clarified. ‚ÄúStay where I can see you. It won‚Äôt be long.‚Äù

Climbing inside, Kurenai was on the sole seat whilst Kazuto was on his lap. It was a bit small for him as he had to lean forward so that his head didn‚Äôt hit the top of the pod. The headsets were brought down though he forgo the usage of the headset since he was still watching over them. The game was chosen; they were ready to fly.

The game? ‚ÄòCrimson Skies‚Äô on the TsuMo. Or otherwise known as the ‚ÄòTsuMo Multi-Game Motion System.

After showing the mission details, and a brief overview of how the control works, the motion machine was set upright as it started. Since this was the arcade version, it immediately threw you into the action.

The enemies in front of them were marked in red text, and their blood red aircraft that they were using was speeding up to engage. The joysticks vibrated with each trigger pull, and the throttle increased and decreased the acceleration speed of the aircraft, which made the pod lean back or tilt forward. And the pod very regularly leaned on its axis, making his feet push against the bar they had your legs on to secure you from slipping out easily. He‚Äôd had to hold onto Kazuto before that could happen to him.

That‚Äôs where he learned that Kazuto was very good at gaming. It was only three minutes, but he achieved the high score so easily. Thus, he made a new record.

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Kazuto cheered, bumping a fist up in the air in cheer. So happy that he was, he didn‚Äôt realize his actions slammed against Kurenai‚Äôs face, making him frown. ‚ÄúGomen.‚Äù

Kurenai hummed as he patted his head, not really affected by said punch. ‚ÄúSugu, want to give this a go?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt push it when she shook her head no.

That didn‚Äôt mean she didn‚Äôt join in on the other games where all of them could reasonably fit together.

There was the whack-a-moles, large piano tiles, the arcade shooters (*they quickly moved away from the zombie ones when Suguha became rightly terrified of the second boss, Codenamed: Fool, which was a giant man-eating sloth*), the spinning fortune wheel (*by god the levers they had were hard for them to push down*), ski-balls, basket balls, they even got those water guns.

They didn‚Äôt really have pizza, but Japanese food was really good to a great majority of the world. Four words: Chicken Katsu Bento Boxes. But of course, no matter how good it smelled, his mood soured a bit when he was reminded that couldn‚Äôt taste anything when he bit into it. Fizzy drinks be damned.

All in all, they had fun today and Kurenai counted it as a success because the kids of his family didn‚Äôt immediately scorn him.

Not that they were given any reason to, but‚Ä¶ Great fears abound, he just hopes he doesn‚Äôt go do crazy things around them.

\[*That very same day, I enjoyed time with the family. Learning personally on how each carried themselves in the years since I‚Äôve been gone.*

*Those two aren‚Äôt far, but they aren‚Äôt as close as they should be. This was why I didn‚Äôt want to be someone younger. I don‚Äôt believe they know the actions they are doing when they‚Äôre young will be going to have a great impact on when they‚Äôre older. How and what children experience will majorly affect their entire mindset and actions.*

*Suguha is too fixated, acting too responsible and mature than she needs to be. I fear that she will be growing up stern, probably almost too stoic. Kids at her age should be having fun. But her mind is like a razor-sharp edge that could rarely be sheathed. Anything she believes she can do, her will would be insurmountable. Perhaps even detrimental if turned double-edge.*

*Kazuto is too laxed. Although he‚Äôs smart, he is aloof. His work ethic is almost non-existent, but he has skill in electronics and technology far beyond any of his age. Building his own computer without any assistance beyond just tutorial videos on the internet.*

*I would continue wringing out the stains on them, and polishing their greatest qualities, until they shine and sparkle.*\]

Thanks. Still, I hope she‚Äôs allergic to it and breaks out in hives.‚Äù

We had a restless night, but were cautiously optimistic that we had been sufficiently servile to convince Luke to reassume his dominion over Brooke‚Äôs body ‚Äì and over our lives. 

Late morning the following day, he texted Brooke: I‚Äôve decided to give you another, FINAL chance. It was the cuck‚Äôs foot massage and steak, your tits and the perfume that convinced me. I‚Äôm traveling all week, so Kevin will bring my clothes over next weekend. Make sure he feels welcome too. 

‚ÄúThank god!‚Äù Brooke said. We hugged, then she sat down at the kitchen table and actually cried a little with relief. After she settled down, she said, ‚ÄúThank you. It sounds like he wants to come back more because of you than me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be silly. You know he loves having sex with you. That was obvious last night. He‚Äôs just trying to diminish you; he‚Äôs still trying to punish you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou may be right. But I don‚Äôt care why, at this point. The important thing is he‚Äôs coming back. At least he likes my tits,‚Äù she said, with a little smile.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the loveliest, most perfect tits on earth, so no surprise there. Are you sure you really want to go through with this, darling? He won‚Äôt make it easy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know he won‚Äôt. But, yes, I‚Äôm sure. Last night was humiliating, but it was amazing. When he pounds me like that, when he manhandles me, it‚Äôs like I can actually feel the stress leave my body.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHow about a deep tissue massage? It‚Äôs a lot less humiliating,‚Äù I said, only half joking.
 
‚ÄúVery funny. We‚Äôve been through all this before. When Luke dominates me in bed, it‚Äôs degrading, yes, but it‚Äôs liberating at the same time. It‚Äôs like I can lose myself. I guess it‚Äôs sort of sad that I feel the need to lose myself, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot at all. We all want to lose ourselves at times, me included.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not just something I want; it‚Äôs something I need, and need often. Or regularly, at least. And Luke is the only one who can make do that. The bastard.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe problem is that he now seems intent on dominating and degrading you well beyond the bedroom.‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a price that I‚Äôm willing to pay. I need him, Walter.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs long as you‚Äôre sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre happy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes! I‚Äôm happy. A little scared, too, but happy. Let‚Äôs have a drink to celebrate. Make me a martini.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not even noon yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost lunchtime. I‚Äôll heat up leftovers, while you shake. We‚Äôll have a three martini lunch.‚Äù

‚ÄúBrooke, I can‚Äôt drink that much in the middle of the day.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kidding. We‚Äôll have one.‚Äù

So I prepared the drinks and we sat down to lunch. We toasted the quality and creativity of our groveling. We toasted our conqueror. We toasted the resumption of ‚Äúthe game,‚Äù which now promised to be more challenging and unpredictable than ever. She ended up having two martinis. That troubled me, but I consoled myself by my certainty that Brooke‚Äôs drinking problem was not something Luke would abide. For all of his insults and cruelty, I believe he really does care about her on some level. 

Three days later, back on campus, I knocked on Neil‚Äôs closed office door. It was the middle of the second week of the new semester, and I hadn‚Äôt seen him since before the winter break. I knew he and Luke had worked out together at the gym recently, but I had no idea what Luke had told him about his break, and reconciliation (if one could call it that), with Brooke. I suppose it was possible that Luke had told him nothing, but I sincerely doubted it.

Neil opened his door and regarded me with a warm smile. ‚ÄúHey, stranger!‚Äù He shook my hand firmly. ‚ÄúGreat to see you. Come in and sit down.‚Äù 

I sat down on the chair across from his desk and he closed the door. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve come by your office a few times. I even texted you. You haven‚Äôt been avoiding me, have you, pal?‚Äù he said, with a smile, as he sat on his chair behind his desk.

In truth, I had been. I had been very stressed out by Brooke‚Äôs depression and by all the drama with Luke over the past week. I had no idea what Neil knew or didn‚Äôt know, so felt it was simply best to keep my distance from him until things were more clear. 

‚ÄúOf course, not. I have a very light load this semester. I haven‚Äôt been in my office much. Sorry, I meant to text you back. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve been a little‚Ä¶preoccupied lately, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúI understand. Luke filled me in on what‚Äôs been going on. I can imagine it‚Äôs been pretty tough for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶what did he tell you exactly?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, we‚Äôre all friends, here. Luke knows he can trust me. You know that, too, I hope?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, I do. But what did he tell you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe told me that he and Brooke had a big fight before Christmas, that there was no contact between him and the two of you for the last few months. But he said that during that time apart, you and Brooke had an epiphany. He actually used that word. Luke often surprises me. He may be a blue collar guy, but he‚Äôs no dummy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, he surprises me, too. What did he say was our epiphany?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat you‚Äôre both deeply submissive sexually. Even more than sexually. That you begged him to come back and take control of your lives. That you have a weight problem and Brooke has a drinking problem and you both need his discipline. But more than that, he said that you and Brooke have realized that for your lives to truly have meaning, you both really need to submit to him totally. Is that true?‚Äù

What could I say? If I contradicted Luke, that could jeopardize everything Brooke and I had just fought so hard for. And, fundamentally, wasn‚Äôt there truth in what Luke told Neil? It wasn‚Äôt the full story, of course. The full story is that Brooke is sexually dependent on Luke. And I, her chivalrous knight, am hopelessly in love with Brooke and will do anything for her, including enslaving myself to the man to whom she is sexually addicted. And, yes, I find his domination arousing and exciting, too. And, yes, he does instill discipline in our lives ‚Äì with a heavy hand, but nonetheless (or perhaps because of that) effective. And Brooke views sex as a vital part of life and views life as a game and boredom as tantamount to death. And, through her, I have come increasingly to view life as a game, too. And, like her, I have come to appreciate that our lives are a hell of lot more interesting and exciting under the control of this flawed, but magnificent alpha male than without him in our lives. And that the requirement that we submit to him more fully is not our idea, but rather his condition for coming back. And, most crucially of all, that, if he is not a part of her life, my cherished lady may die.

So, I answered more honestly than not, ‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs true, I guess, more or less. It‚Äôs a little more complicated than that maybe.‚Äù I could only meet his eyes for a moment before looking downwards.

‚ÄúLook, pal, when you first told me about the unorthodox relationship between Luke, Brooke and you, I told you that I didn‚Äôt completely understand, but that I wouldn‚Äôt judge you. Remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, and I truly appreciated it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs still the case. One hundred percent. I don‚Äôt judge you and, having watched you interact with Luke these past many months, I‚Äôve gained a much better understanding of the mind of a masochist. I want to help you, pal. In fact, Luke explicitly asked for my help.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Hey, I really hurt my foot hiking in the mountains with Laura when we in North Carolina visiting my parents. I could sure use one of your brilliant foot massages now. Why don‚Äôt you work your magic, while we keep talking,‚Äù Neil said, swiveling his chair so that his feet were pointing out. He looked down towards his feet. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the right one.‚Äù

I looked back to make sure the door was fully closed, then got down on my knees in front of my colleague, removed his brown loafer and black sock, and began pressing my fingers into his arch. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs higher up where it‚Äôs really bothering me. More on the sole of my foot.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that the right area?‚Äù I asked, making the adjustment. 

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù Neil said, sighing contentedly, and reclining back in his chair.  

‚ÄúWhat did he mean by asking you for your help?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúHelp making sure you adhere to your diet, that you don‚Äôt cheat and you get enough exercise. I can see you‚Äôve put back on several pounds since I last saw you. Help with disciplining you.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I thought we were friends.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come on, Walter. It‚Äôs not like this will be something completely new. Remember that time Luke had me paddle you when blew your weigh-in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, how could I ever forget that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe made you thank me after every time I hit you. That was pretty funny. Our friendship survived that just fine. Of course, we‚Äôre friends. But not all friendships are equal. I‚Äôm not a masochist. You are. No big deal.‚Äù

From there, Neil steered the conversation towards academic matters, talk about our respective classes and books. 

After giving me an update on the progress of his book, he asked, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your book coming along?‚Äù 

‚ÄúPretty slowly. I didn‚Äôt get that much done over the break. I feel a little blocked.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe that‚Äôs because Luke hasn‚Äôt been around to inspire you. Now that you‚Äôve passed this new milestone in the relationship between the three of you, I‚Äôll bet the pages will flow like a river. Just you wait and see. That reminds me, I got you something. A late Christmas present.‚Äù 

He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out an old leather-bound book that he handed me: The Poems of Algernon Charles Swinburne.

He said, ‚ÄúI found this in a used bookstore in Asheville, of all places, and thought of you. It‚Äôs an 1884 edition.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Neil. It‚Äôs beautiful. I‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt bring a present for you.‚Äù It was indeed a beautiful, and very thoughtful, gift ‚Äì one that validated his reassurance about our ongoing friendship. Researching on-line after the fact, I was sure the book must have set Neil back at least $200. And I didn‚Äôt think to buy him anything‚Ä¶

He smiled warmly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, pal. You‚Äôre giving me the best present possible with those magic hands of yours. My foot is feeling better already. The other one could use some attention as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù I picked up his other foot and removed his shoe.

As I reached for his sock, he said, ‚ÄúLaura says my socks stink something awful when my feet sweat in these particular shoes. I think she exaggerates to tease me. What do you think?‚Äù He pressed his socked foot up against my nose. Now essentially deputized by Luke to assist in dominating me, Neil was obviously willing to push the boundaries in his interactions with me. Just how far would he be willing to go?, I wondered to myself. His sock was slightly moist, but not truly sweaty, so the odor was faintly acrid but not overpowering.

I inhaled, as expected apparently, and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not too bad. Just a little sour.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell Laura that you disagree with her. Go ahead and take it off now.‚Äù I did as he asked (commanded?) and began massaging his bare left foot. It wasn‚Äôt as large and meaty as Luke‚Äôs foot, but a respectable size 11, I suspected. 

‚ÄúYou know, pal, Luke suggested that I insist you address me as ‚Äòsir.‚Äô I certainly wouldn‚Äôt expect that all the time, of course, such as in front of students or other faculty members, but when you‚Äôre in a clearly subservient position like this or fetching me coffee, I think it‚Äôs appropriate. Don‚Äôt you agree?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúSee, it feels natural, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù And, as ashamed as I felt, I was not lying. As if to second my words, my already hard cock (currently free of chastity) stiffened further beneath my jeans. Looking downwards, I could see a small tent in my jeans, and was hoping Neil would not notice from his state of repose.

He continued, ‚ÄúI had never really read Swinburne before, but his technique is often excellent. He really was fixated on feet and flogging, though. I can see his appeal to you. A kindred masochistic spirit. That Flogging-Block poem is really something, isn‚Äôt it?  It‚Äôs borderline gay S&M pornography, written during the repressive Victorian era.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it wasn‚Äôt published until 100 years after he died. But he did publish some other poems about flogging in boarding school under pseudonyms during his lifetime.‚Äù

‚ÄúFascinating. I guess his psyche was shaped from his time in boarding school. Being punished by cruel headmasters and prefects. It perverted him, didn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess so. People, young men in particular, tend to eroticize traumatic or difficult experiences as a coping mechanism. Swinburne eroticized the floggings he received at Eton, much as young men eroticize their rejection by young women and become obsessed with cuckolding for the rest of their lives.‚Äù

‚ÄúWas that true of you, Walter? The cuckolding part, I mean.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, I believe so. I had it really bad for a girl in my senior year of high school. I was pretty devastated when she dumped me for this arrogant jock on the wrestling team. My cuckolding fantasies began around that time. It probably didn‚Äôt help when he flicked my bare ass with a wet towel in the locker room after gym class shortly after he stole my girlfriend. It really hurt. All of his jock friends laughed at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you start to fantasize about him sexually after that?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot about having sex with him or anything like that. But yes, I started to imagine that I was his towel boy. That I was responsible for picking up and cleaning his sweaty wrestling singlet and jock strap after his wrestling matches, and for handing him towels during matches. I even imagined wiping the sweat off his biceps, back and legs. My ex-girlfriend would always be present in my fantasies, laughing at me, at my subservience to him. But it was different with flogging. Even as a young kid, I was fascinated by stories and pictures of corporal punishment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, Luke and Brooke have sort of brought all that to life for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir. They certainly have.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really fortunate in many respects. Not many masochists get the opportunity to live out their fantasies, I‚Äôll bet. I‚Äôm pretty confident that me helping out here will only deepen our friendship in the long run. Do those toe snaps you do sometimes. On both feet. I like those. So, do them every time from now on.‚Äù

‚ÄòYes, sir,‚Äù I said as I began massaging and snapping each toe individually

‚ÄúAh, that‚Äôs it. That feels good. As I was saying, I think this evolution of our friendship will bring us closer than ever. You would never have shared those details with me about the origins of your masochism the way things were with us before, would you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, sir, probably not.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think so. This will allow for a new intimacy between us. You can really be yourself around me from now on. Go ahead, Walter, kiss the bottom of my foot. You know you want to.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know any such thing. He was my colleague. But I didn‚Äôt know that I didn‚Äôt want to either. It seemed right at the moment, right to obey him. So I placed my lips just under his toes and gently kissed.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said, matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúNow, about your weight. You said that you‚Äôll be on campus only three days per week this semester, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir,‚Äù I said, still slightly in a state of shock at what had just transpired.

‚ÄúAs I said, I‚Äôm loaded up with classes. So, I won‚Äôt have time to walk over the Corner Coffee every day. Besides, I don‚Äôt want to walk that much until my foot heals more. You‚Äôll do it on the three days you‚Äôre here. We‚Äôll work out a schedule. It‚Äôll be great exercise for you. Then we can have coffee together while you massage my feet. It‚Äôll be quality bonding time with one of my best buddies, right pal.‚Äù With that, he smiled and affectionately (?) tousled my hair with his bare foot.

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù 

After I finished putting his shoes and socks back on, he said, ‚ÄúThese old loafers are a little scuffed up. I know you have a shoeshine kit to take care of Luke‚Äôs extensive footwear collection. I don‚Äôt expect you to bring in that big bulky thing here ‚Äì that would raise some eyebrows, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúBut it should be pretty easy for you to stick a can of shoe polish and a polishing rag in your briefcase, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Bring those next time.‚Äù

When I stood up, he glanced briefly at my crotch. My cock was still erect beneath the tight pair of jeans ‚Äì skinny jeans, I believe they are called ‚Äì Brooke had brought me. My paunch showed above my belt. Given Neil‚Äôs semi obsession with my weight, it was difficult to say which of the two protrusions caused me more embarrassment: my paunch or my erection. I detected a slight smirk as Neil resumed eye contact. He then smiled and warmly shook my hand.

‚ÄúReally great to see you, pal. Don‚Äôt forget your book,‚Äù he said, handing me the weighty volume. ‚ÄúSee you around 3 PM on Wednesday. I‚Äôm looking forward to our coffee klatch.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe, too, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot ‚Äòsir‚Äô now, pal. Only when you‚Äôre in a position, or act, of submission. When we‚Äôre interacting normally, it‚Äôs just Neil, as always. Got it?‚Äù

‚ÄòYes, s‚Ä¶I mean Neil. Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù He laughed good-naturedly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take a little getting used to for both of us.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Neil. And thanks again for the book. Really. I‚Äôll see you on Wednesday.‚Äù

That meeting with Neil was my first inkling into how meaningfully things would change for Brooke and me following Luke‚Äôs triumphant return to our lives. There were many, many more to come.

I was scheduled to make my first return visit to Paul and Anna‚Äôs condo the following day. After three months of freedom, it suddenly felt as if the walls of servitude were closing in around me from all directions. 

When I got home that evening, Brooke greeted me with a kiss and said, ‚ÄúLuke called me today. He‚Äôs having a dinner party next Saturday at his house for his whole executive leadership team. He just hired the last member of his team, a new Chief Marketing Officer. Such corporate bullshit, right? Everybody has to have ‚ÄòChief‚Äô in their title nowadays. Imagine that at a restaurant. Chief busboy. Chief dishwasher. Anyhow, he wants to have cocktails and dinner to welcome this new guy and to celebrate that his team is now complete. So it‚Äôll be a bunch of guys and their wives, I imagine. Guess who‚Äôs going to be the wait and catering staff for this grand event?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe professor and Brooke?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou got it. He‚Äôs expecting me to wear my waitress uniform from the restaurant and you to wear the waiter uniform you first served him dinner in.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least he‚Äôs not expecting me to wear what I wore when I served him dinner the other night.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs true. But we have our work cut out for us. We have to plan a three course meal as well as hors d‚Äôoeuvres and cocktails. There will be about 10 guests altogether, so we‚Äôll l be working our asses off. He expects us to call everyone ‚Äòsir‚Äô and ‚Äòmiss‚Äô and to treat them like royalty. I‚Äôm sure he loves the idea of having an English professor and an English major waiting hand and foot on all of his corporate underlings.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be a walk in the park.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, let the game begin,‚Äù Brooke said. ‚ÄúI need a drink.‚Äù

At the time, I couldn‚Äôt figure out why I didn‚Äôt like being around her or why she gave off this aura. Since I was new to making coffee, it took me a couple of weeks to understand how to make different coffee without asking the other coworkers for help. Lisa always gave me the ‚Äúyou should know how to make the drink‚Äù look when I asked what ingredients or how many pumps of syrup a certain drink gets in the first 2 weeks of working with her. I was shocked since Lisa has been working there longer than me and should be nice to help me understand the drinks. But my lovely manager, let's call her Callie, was very helpful in stepping in when I asked questions. Lisa ended up helping me every time Callie was around and stopped when Callie wasn‚Äôt around. I was confused about why Lisa did this but didn‚Äôt question it.¬†

During the second week of working with Lisa, she asked me ‚ÄòHow many hours do you plan to work each week?‚Äô. When I got hired, the high-upper manager, let's call her Terri, told me during the interview, that I would only be a part-time employee until I worked with the company for about a year before becoming a full-time employee. I‚Äôm in college working on my bachelor's online so working part-time is okay for me, but I did tell Callie and Terri, that I do have an open schedule as long I have time to work on my classwork.¬†

So I told Lisa, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care how many hours I work each week, as long I come in and make some money.‚Äô When I told Lisa this, she glared at me and said, ‚ÄòWell, don‚Äôt expect to work more than 15 hours a week. It took me a while to work more than 15 hours a week.‚Äô Lisa has only been working at the company for about 9 months at this time and she just graduated high school. I was taken aback by what Lisa said to me and continued to work making drinks for customers.¬†

After working at the company for a month, Lisa quickly found out I was working about 25 to 39 hours a week and was making more money an hour than her. I soon quickly felt Lisa's aura turn anger to me every time I was around her and she talked about me in Spanish to the other co-workers who speak Spanish. I don‚Äôt understand Spanish, but I know when someone talks about me in a different language because of the tone they use. So, I just stopped talking to her until she asked me to get some more cups or other supplies we needed for work. I know Lisa didn‚Äôt like me but I‚Äôm confused about what I did to her to make her hate me so much.¬†

It soon came to me that Lisa is very self-centered and gets jealous quickly. For example, Lisa's boyfriend also works in the same company as us but in a different section. Every time Lisa saw any young teenage girl customer walk up to her boyfriend to ask a question, she glared at the customer and quietly said, ‚ÄòWhat does that b\*\*\* want from him?‚Äù I see no reason for Lisa to act like this when a customer is only asking a question to her boyfriend.

Another example happened to me. It happened one morning when Terri came to pick up the coffee she ordered online when Lisa and I were scheduled together. Lisa and Terri were talking which I didn‚Äôt pay to attend because I was making drinks, until I heard Terri say my name. Terri told Lisa that I was her new favorite employee and Lisa quickly looked at me. I just stood there shocked since I don‚Äôt talk to Terri a lot but only say hi to her when I see her in the morning or when I ask her to approve a shift cover. I could feel Lisa's aura shift again, and I quickly returned to make drinks for online orders. Lisa asked Terri why I was her favorite employee and Terri only said, ‚ÄòShe (me) always said hi to all the customers and is very friendly to everyone.‚Äô Lisa approached me after Terri left and questioned me about Terri. Like, how long have Terri and you been talking and how have Terri and you got so close? I quickly told Lisa I barely talked to Terri and told her I said hi to Terri and asked for approval of shift cover. Lisa quickly turned away to return to whatever she was doing before Terri showed up.

I soon find out after Terri situation, that Lisa is being trained to be an assistant manager for the coffee place in the company. Lisa did tell me this but also told me she can‚Äôt be fully trained correctly because she started college. I don‚Äôt know why Lisa is telling me this since she knew I was planning to leave the company when I finished my bachelor's degree. I think she is trying to get a reaction from me but I don‚Äôt care if she becomes an assistant manager or not.

It has been about 5 months now since I started working at the coffee place with Lisa. I have honestly told Callie, that I don‚Äôt like working with Lisa. I did say to Callie that Lisa just me a weird aura and she just made me feel uncomfortable being around her, like she watching me. I did have another co-worker tell me that Lisa doesn‚Äôt like me and I told the co-worker ‚ÄòI already know that‚Äô since we were already talking about Lisa being trained to be an assistant manager and how her school is in her way. This co-worker told me I need to be careful when I talk about Lisa since she has a lot of friends at work. Why do I need to be careful when talking about Lisa? It is not like I talking about how bad of a worker she is or anything negative about her at work.

I concluded that Lisa hates me for the following reasons:

* Working more hours than her in the first month of working
* Making more money an hour
* Everyone at work like me including the high-up managers

I could be wrong about why Lisa hates me.",1,1728950943.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I've now been living with him for 4 years, and my mom has still not tried to develop a relationship with him. On the contrary she disrespected our home when she was babysitting once and refused to apologize for it. She also has never respected the boundaries I set regarding my children.

About a month ago, my son asked me to take him to Starbucks to pick up a drink my mom had ordered for him‚Äîa venti pumpkin Frappuccino. It didn‚Äôt sit right with me because my son doesn‚Äôt need that much caffeine and sugar. So I messaged my mom, asking her not to do that again. Last week, she did it again. This time, I refused to go pick up the order  , which caused a huge fight between us.

She insists that in the grand scheme of things, a fight over coffee will be meaningless. But to  me, it‚Äôs not just about the coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs about her complete disregard for my boundaries as a parent. She just doesn't seem to understand that.

Now, I‚Äôm at a point where I don‚Äôt even want to invite her to my wedding. Just the thought of her being there is stressful because she always insists on doing things her way and disregards other people‚Äôs decisions.

1g3unnh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3unnh,Challengers in Black Teacore Horserump from Maryam Tannery ,"**INTRO**

Finally got these in today!! I had some shipping delays just like a lot of others on here but luckily my pair found their way home lol. I placed my order the morning of the 26th but didn't get a proper shipping update until the 10th I believe and that was after some back and forth with customer service. In the end it all worked out and I'm more than pleased with my purchase. These are GORGEOUS boots!!! 

**LEATHER**

I ordered my challengers in the teacore horse rump from Maryam to match my teacore jeans from pure blue japan. The leather is a beautiful oily black over a clean veg tan with slight texture from the grain. No calipers so I can't give a perfect measurement.. But with my tape measure I was able get about 3mm thickness on most parts of the leather. Some spots closer to 2.5mm and some spots closer to 4mm. This is some burly shit. The leather heel stack and welt are dyed and burnished a dark coffee brown for an almost tonal look. One thing I think is cool about the leather is that in direct sunlight they have slight brown tint to them. I'm a big fan of the black/brown combo. Can't wait to see how these patina! 

**FIT**

I ordered these in the same size as my 2017 Captains, size 11D. Oh boy, these fit like a dream! Just perfect right out of the box. Foot slid in with little resistance, heel locked in nicely, and toes can wiggle, I'm a happy camper. The full leather and cork insole/shank/midsole is stiff at first but it feels like it should have some give and mold to my foot properly. The chunky lug sole doesn't help with the stiffness but I'm loving how rugged they are. Definitely not a fashion boot sole. I'm also loving the tall logger heel, helps me feel balanced and stable in my step. The vamp around the forefoot is probably the snuggest part of the boot but I have a high instep so this not unusual for me. Overall I'm so psyched on my pair! Excited to put these to work!

When my grandfather passed away last year, I inherited his old house. It wasn‚Äôt the kind of place you‚Äôd find in glossy magazines‚Äîmore of a sprawling, creaky relic of a time long gone, the kind that seems to absorb every sound and secret over the decades. I hadn't visited the house in years, not since I was a kid, and back then, it had always felt a little too big and a little too quiet, the kind of place where shadows hung around just a second too long.

After the funeral, I wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with it, so the house just sat there, collecting dust, waiting. A couple of weeks ago, though, I finally made the trip back to clear out his things. It wasn‚Äôt an easy task‚Äîhe‚Äôd lived there for nearly 50 years, and every corner seemed crammed with forgotten boxes, old furniture, and memories that had started to fade long before he did.

I spent hours working my way through the clutter, but it was the attic that truly overwhelmed me. It was stuffy and dim, filled with that heavy, stale air that hits you when something hasn‚Äôt been disturbed in years. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to find anything of value, mostly just mementos‚Äîphotos, papers, maybe some old clothes. But then, tucked away in a dusty box hidden beneath layers of yellowing newspapers, I found something that gave me pause: an old, unmarked VHS tape.

It wasn‚Äôt unusual for my grandfather to record things; he had an entire shelf dedicated to home movies and random tapes. But this one was different. There was no label, no date, nothing to indicate what it contained. Just a plain, black VHS, sitting there as if it had been waiting for me all along.

I should have tossed it aside with the rest of the junk, but something about it stuck with me. Curiosity got the better of me, and I brought it downstairs, telling myself it was probably just another forgotten home video. But deep down, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that there was something else to it, something darker that had been left buried for a reason.

I was about to find out why.

I didn‚Äôt have a VCR on hand‚Äîit‚Äôs not exactly something people keep around anymore‚Äîbut I remembered seeing one tucked away in the guest bedroom closet, probably stashed there by my grandfather during his last spring cleaning spree. After digging through old blankets and boxes of random knick-knacks, I found it: a bulky, outdated machine that had probably been sitting untouched for years.

I dusted it off, carried it downstairs, and hooked it up to the TV in the living room. As I worked, I started to second-guess myself. There was no reason to think this tape was anything special. It was probably some boring footage from a family reunion or a fishing trip. But that nagging feeling wouldn‚Äôt let go, the sense that this wasn‚Äôt just a random home video. Maybe it was the fact that it was hidden so deliberately, or maybe it was just my imagination running wild after spending hours in that musty attic. Either way, I had to know.

I slid the tape into the VCR, and the machine swallowed it with a soft mechanical whir. The TV screen flickered to life, but at first, all I saw was static, the kind that makes that faint hissing sound like a distant wind. I was about to fast-forward when the screen suddenly shifted, revealing shaky, handheld footage.

It took me a second to realize what I was looking at‚Äîa normal, ordinary living room. The kind of generic space that could‚Äôve been from any home in the 80s or 90s. There was a man sitting on a couch, his back to the camera, and I recognized him instantly: my grandfather. He was younger, though, maybe in his forties, and he didn‚Äôt seem to know he was being filmed.

I watched as he stared ahead, unmoving, his hands resting on his knees. Something about the way he sat there struck me as odd‚Äîhe was so still, too still, like he was waiting for something. The camera lingered on him for a long time, far longer than felt normal. There was no sound, no movement, just him sitting there in silence.

And then, without warning, the camera swung around, revealing the rest of the room. It was the same living room I was sitting in now, except‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt. The walls looked different‚Äîbare, almost unfinished‚Äîand there was a strange mark on the far wall, something I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. It looked like a dark stain, almost like a smudge or a burn, but it wasn‚Äôt clear on the old tape.

The camera zoomed in on the mark, and for a second, I thought I saw something shift within it, something that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I leaned forward, trying to get a closer look, when the screen suddenly cut to black.

I waited, expecting it to start back up again, but the screen stayed dark. I hit the fast-forward button, and the tape whirred, skipping ahead through several minutes of static. Then, abruptly, the footage resumed‚Äîbut it wasn‚Äôt the living room anymore.

It was somewhere else. Somewhere much worse.

The new footage was darker, grainier, and harder to make out. At first, I thought the camera was pointed at nothing‚Äîjust a dark, indistinct blur. But as the picture steadied, I realized it was filming a basement. Not just any basement, though. It looked exactly like *my* basement.

The angles were different, and the space seemed emptier than it does now‚Äîno shelves full of old junk, no stored furniture. The floor was bare concrete, with only a few stray objects scattered around. There was that same mark on the far wall, though, the one I had just seen in the living room. Except down here, it was larger, more pronounced, almost like it had spread.

The camera slowly panned across the room, the quiet hum of the tape the only sound. There was something deeply unsettling about the footage, a heaviness that made the air feel colder around me. It wasn‚Äôt just the eerie quiet, or the empty space, or even the unsettling familiarity. It was the way the camera moved‚Äîdeliberate, as if it was looking for something. Or *watching* something.

Suddenly, the camera jerked, the screen blurring for a second. When it refocused, I saw what it was pointed at now: a figure standing in the corner of the basement. My breath caught in my throat.

The figure was tall, but distorted by the shadows. It stood perfectly still, facing the far wall with its back to the camera. At first, I couldn‚Äôt make out any details‚Äîjust the outline of its body, draped in darkness. I leaned closer to the screen, trying to figure out what I was looking at, when I saw the figure‚Äôs head begin to move.

Slowly, it turned, just enough for me to see its profile. It had no features. No face. Just a smooth, blank surface where a face should be.

I pulled back from the screen, my heart pounding in my chest. What the hell was I watching? The figure remained motionless, its head now angled slightly toward the camera, like it was aware of being filmed. A low, static hum filled the room, and for a moment, I swore I heard something beneath it‚Äîa faint whispering, like voices just out of reach.

I paused the tape, my finger hovering over the button. My eyes flicked toward the basement door, which was just down the hall from where I was sitting. The house was dead quiet, but in that moment, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was stirring down there. Something I couldn‚Äôt see.

I hit play again, but the tape didn‚Äôt resume where it left off. Instead, it cut to a new scene. The camera was back in the living room, but now it was night. The room was dimly lit, and the only light came from a single lamp in the corner. The figure wasn‚Äôt in the shot anymore. Instead, the camera was shaking slightly, as if being held by someone struggling to stay steady.

And then I heard it‚Äîwhispers, faint at first, but growing louder. It wasn‚Äôt just background noise anymore. The voices were clear, almost like they were speaking directly to me, but I couldn‚Äôt understand what they were saying. The words were garbled, distorted, like they were being spoken underwater.

The camera jerked again, swinging wildly before settling on the front door of the house. My house. The whispers grew louder, more insistent, until they filled the room. I could feel my pulse in my ears, the tension winding tighter with every passing second.

The camera zoomed in on the door, and then‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîthere was a loud *bang*. The screen flickered, distorting for a moment before the image steadied. The whispers cut off abruptly, replaced by the sound of heavy, deliberate footsteps.

I stared at the screen, frozen, as the camera slowly approached the front door. Each step was accompanied by the soft creak of old wood, the sound unnervingly familiar. The door loomed larger and larger, until it filled the screen completely.

And then the camera stopped. The footsteps ceased. For several long seconds, nothing happened. The screen was still. Silent.

Just as I thought the tape was done, the door on the screen *opened*.

But not on its own. It was pulled open from the outside.

And that‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîstanding just beyond the threshold, bathed in shadows, was the same faceless figure. Except this time, it wasn‚Äôt alone.

Behind it, barely visible in the darkness, were more shapes. More figures, watching, waiting.

The whispers returned, louder now, almost deafening. They weren‚Äôt coming from the tape anymore. They were coming from *inside* the house.

The last thing I saw before the screen cut to black was the faceless figure stepping across the threshold, entering my grandfather‚Äôs house.

My house.

And then, from the hallway behind me, I heard a single, slow creak.

Someone was coming up from the basement.

I froze, every muscle locked in place. My eyes flicked from the TV screen to the dark hallway beyond the living room. The old wooden floor let out another creak, slow and deliberate, like someone‚Äîor something‚Äîwas testing each step. The sound echoed in the silence of the house, filling the space between the frantic pounding of my heart.

For a long moment, I just sat there, gripping the remote so hard my knuckles turned white. The whispers from the tape still buzzed in my ears, but they were gone now‚Äîreplaced by the quiet, oppressive weight of whatever was moving down the hall. My mind raced. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, that the tape had messed with my head. But deep down, I knew better.

I stood up, my legs shaky, and slowly backed away from the TV. The screen was black, but the VCR was still running, the tape spinning inside like it had more to show. I didn‚Äôt care. I had to get out of the house. The footsteps stopped, and for a moment, everything was eerily still. Too still. I glanced down the hallway again, but I couldn‚Äôt see anything‚Äîjust the yawning darkness leading to the basement door.

I fumbled for my phone, but my hands were trembling, and I nearly dropped it as I unlocked the screen. I dialed 911, my mind racing. The phone rang once‚Äîthen twice‚Äîbefore cutting off abruptly. No dial tone. Just silence. My heart sank as I stared at the screen. *No signal.* That made no sense. I‚Äôd had full bars earlier.

Then I heard it. A soft, raspy breath. Close. Too close.

It was coming from just outside the living room, where the shadows of the hallway crept into the dim light. I stepped back, my gaze locked on the doorway, barely breathing. The house was old, sure. Noisy, yes. But this‚Ä¶ this was something else.

Another creak. This one sharper, like weight being shifted. My skin prickled as I saw the edge of something‚Äîa hand, or what *should* have been a hand‚Äîwrap around the corner of the doorframe. It was pale, almost gray, like the skin had been drained of all color. Thin fingers, too long, bent unnaturally as they gripped the wood.

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt breathe.

Slowly, impossibly slowly, the figure stepped into view. It was the same faceless thing from the tape, but seeing it here, in the real world, sent an icy terror through me unlike anything I‚Äôd ever felt. Its body was tall and impossibly thin, limbs too long for its torso. The head was smooth, blank, as though someone had forgotten to finish it. It was dressed in dark, tattered clothes that hung off its frame, the fabric barely shifting as it moved toward me.

For a moment, we just stood there, me staring in horror, it standing in silence. Then it took another step. The sound of its foot hitting the floor snapped me out of my paralysis, and I stumbled backward, nearly tripping over the coffee table. My chest tightened, panic surging through me. I had to move. Had to run.

I bolted for the front door, my feet barely touching the ground as I rushed past the figure, my eyes locked on the door just a few feet away. I grabbed the handle, yanked it open, and sprinted outside, not daring to look back. Cold air hit me like a slap, and I gasped, filling my lungs as I ran down the front steps and into the yard.

I stopped once I reached the driveway, breathless, and turned to face the house.

The front door was still wide open, but the figure wasn‚Äôt there. It hadn‚Äôt followed me. The house loomed silently, as if nothing had happened. As if the tape hadn‚Äôt unleashed something ancient, something that had been waiting in the shadows all along.

I stood there, panting, trying to make sense of what I‚Äôd just seen. My mind raced, but there was no rational explanation. There was no way to make sense of the faceless figure, or the tape that had somehow captured things that couldn‚Äôt possibly exist.

But as I stared at the front door, a slow realization crept over me.

This wasn‚Äôt over.

From the darkness of the house, I heard the faintest sound‚Äîa whisper. It wasn‚Äôt from the hallway this time. It wasn‚Äôt even from the basement.

It was right behind me.

I spun around so fast I nearly lost my balance, my heart slamming in my chest. The driveway was empty. The street beyond the house was as quiet as ever, bathed in the dim glow of the old streetlamp at the corner. The wind stirred a few dead leaves along the curb, but nothing else moved. There was no one there.

But the whisper‚ÄîI knew I‚Äôd heard it. Not in my head. It had been real, as real as the cold air now biting into my skin. The faceless figure hadn‚Äôt followed me out, but something had. I could feel it. The oppressive weight, the sense of being watched. It was closer now, closing in on me from all sides.

I backed up, my feet crunching against the gravel as I put more distance between myself and the house. My mind raced, trying to figure out what to do, where to go. I couldn‚Äôt stay here. Whatever had been on that tape wasn‚Äôt confined to just the house anymore. It had crossed over somehow, and it was getting closer with every breath I took.

I had to leave‚Äîhad to get away.

I fumbled with my car keys, my hands shaking so badly it took me three tries to unlock the door. I threw myself into the driver‚Äôs seat, slammed the door shut, and locked it immediately. The silence inside the car felt suffocating, but at least I was away from the house, away from that *thing*. For now.

I shoved the key into the ignition, but just as I was about to turn it, something caught my eye‚Äîmovement in the rearview mirror.

My heart stopped.

There, standing just beyond the edge of the driveway, was a figure. At first, I thought it was just a trick of the light, a shadow cast by the streetlamp. But no‚Ä¶ it was real. Tall, motionless, its head tilted slightly as if observing me. And even though it was too dark to make out any details, I *knew* it had no face.

The faceless figure. It had followed me after all.

I swallowed hard, my fingers frozen on the ignition key. The figure didn‚Äôt move. It just stood there, watching me. Or sensing me. I couldn‚Äôt tell.

Suddenly, I became aware of the temperature inside the car dropping. It wasn‚Äôt just from the cold night air outside‚Äîthis was something unnatural. My breath fogged up in front of me, and a chill ran through my entire body, settling deep in my bones.

And then, from the back seat, I heard the faintest whisper.

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

I whipped my head around, my heart thundering in my chest. The back seat was empty. But the whisper lingered, curling through the air like smoke. I turned back to the front and looked into the rearview mirror again, hoping, praying, that the figure would be gone.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

It had moved closer.

Panic surged through me as I jammed the key into the ignition and turned it, the engine sputtering to life. I floored the gas pedal, tires screeching as the car jerked forward. I didn‚Äôt dare look back as I sped down the road, heart hammering in my chest, hands white-knuckling the steering wheel. I drove as fast as I could, not knowing where I was going, only knowing I had to get as far away from that house‚Äîand whatever had come out of it‚Äîas possible.

But even as I left the house behind, the whispers didn‚Äôt stop.

They followed me, faint but persistent, just beneath the sound of the engine and the wind rushing past the windows. A voice‚Äîno, voices‚Äîrepeating the same phrase over and over.

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

No matter how far I drove, I could still hear them. It was like they were inside my head, or worse‚Äîinside the car with me. I glanced in the rearview mirror again, half-expecting to see the faceless figure sitting right behind me. But the back seat was still empty, and yet, the presence remained.

I didn‚Äôt know how long I drove, or how far I went. Time blurred as the whispers grew louder, more insistent. The road stretched endlessly in front of me, the world outside swallowed by darkness. The same words circled in my mind, wrapping tighter and tighter around me, squeezing the air from my lungs.

Finally, I pulled over. I had to. My hands were trembling so badly I could barely grip the steering wheel anymore. I turned the car off and sat there in the quiet, the engine ticking as it cooled down.

For a moment, there was nothing but silence.

And then the whisper returned, soft, almost gentle this time.

*‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape.‚Äù*

I looked up into the rearview mirror one last time, my heart pounding in my throat.

The faceless figure was sitting in the back seat.

And it was smiling.

My breath caught in my throat. I stared into the rearview mirror, unable to move, unable to think. It shouldn‚Äôt have been possible, but there it was‚Äîsitting just inches behind me. The faceless figure, smooth and featureless where its eyes, nose, and mouth should have been, somehow conveyed the unmistakable sensation of a *smile*. A cold, hungry smile.

I wanted to scream, but my voice wouldn‚Äôt come. My entire body felt locked in place, paralyzed by fear. Slowly, almost mechanically, I turned around in my seat, my heart hammering in my chest. The back seat was empty. Just like before.

I blinked, confusion mixing with terror. There was nothing there‚Äîno figure, no shadow. But I had seen it. I *knew* I had seen it.

And then, the whisper came again.

*‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt escape.‚Äù*

This time, it wasn‚Äôt coming from the back seat. It was all around me. Inside the car, inside my head. I gasped, gripping the steering wheel tighter as the pressure built inside my skull. The whisper was growing louder, the words layering on top of each other until it felt like they were filling every corner of my mind.

I couldn‚Äôt stay here. I couldn‚Äôt just sit and wait for‚Ä¶ whatever this was to claim me. My hands trembled as I reached for the ignition, desperate to start the car and drive again, but the key wouldn‚Äôt turn. I yanked it, but it was stuck, refusing to budge, as if something‚Äîor someone‚Äîwas holding it in place.

The whispers grew louder still, rising to a fever pitch, and then, all at once, they stopped.

The silence was suffocating.

And then I heard it. The unmistakable sound of breathing. Heavy, deliberate, like someone was sitting right next to me.

I turned my head ever so slowly toward the passenger seat. My pulse roared in my ears, drowning out everything else.

There, in the seat beside me, was the faceless figure.

It hadn‚Äôt been in the back seat after all. It was sitting right next to me now, close enough that I could feel the cold radiating off its body. Its head tilted slightly, as if studying me, and though it had no eyes, I felt its gaze pierce through me, deep and unforgiving.

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt scream. My body had completely shut down, trapped in that horrible, frozen moment.

And then it spoke‚Äînot in a whisper this time, but in a voice that reverberated through the air, low and unnatural.

*‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stayed away.‚Äù*

Its hand‚Äîif you could call it that‚Äîbegan to move toward me. The fingers were long, thin, and wrong, like they were bending in ways they shouldn‚Äôt be able to. I could feel the air grow colder the closer it came, like it was draining the life from the very space around it.

I had to move. Had to *do* something. But my body refused to obey, my muscles locked in place, as if some invisible force was holding me there, forcing me to watch as the figure inched closer and closer.

Finally, when its fingers were just about to brush my arm, something in me snapped. With a burst of sheer, primal panic, I ripped the door handle open and threw myself out of the car, crashing to the ground in a heap. I scrambled to my feet, not daring to look back as I stumbled away from the car, my legs barely holding me up as I ran into the night.

I didn‚Äôt know where I was going, only that I had to get away. The whispers had returned, soft at first but growing louder with every step I took. They filled the air around me, curling into my ears, my mind, until they were the only thing I could hear.

*‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stayed away.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve stayed away.‚Äù*

I ran, breathless, until my lungs burned and my legs gave out beneath me. I collapsed onto the cold ground, gasping for air, my vision swimming. I couldn‚Äôt hear anything over the pounding of my own heart, but I knew it was still there. I *felt* it. That presence, lurking just beyond the edge of the darkness, waiting.

The whispers fell silent, replaced by a low hum, like the vibration of something enormous moving just out of sight. I looked up, my heart pounding in my throat, and saw something I hadn‚Äôt noticed before.

I was back.

Back at the house.

I had run in a full circle, and now, standing before me, was the front door to my grandfather‚Äôs house, wide open as if inviting me in. The darkness inside seemed deeper than it should have been, as though it wasn‚Äôt just the absence of light, but something more. Something alive.

From within the house, I saw movement‚Äîslow, deliberate.

The faceless figure stepped into the doorway, standing there, still and silent, waiting.

The whispers returned, louder than ever now, swirling around me like a storm.

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back inside.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

I stumbled to my feet, shaking my head, backing away from the house. But no matter how far I stepped, I couldn‚Äôt escape the pull. It was like the ground beneath me was tilting, dragging me back toward that door, toward the figure waiting inside.

I wanted to scream. Wanted to run. But deep down, I knew it was too late.

I‚Äôd opened the door.

And now, there was no closing it.

I stumbled back, my mind racing for any kind of escape, any way to fight the pull that was dragging me toward the house. My legs felt heavy, as though they were no longer mine, as though the ground beneath me had turned to quicksand, swallowing me inch by inch. I tried to scream, but the sound died in my throat, choked out by the suffocating pressure building all around me.

The faceless figure stood motionless in the doorway, its head slightly tilted, as if waiting for me to give in. The darkness behind it seemed to pulse, alive and hungry. I could still hear the whispers swirling around me, their tone almost‚Ä¶ coaxing now. Less insistent. As if they knew I was weakening.

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

I shook my head, backing away as far as I could, but with every step I took, the house seemed to grow larger, closer. It was as if the distance between me and the front door had collapsed entirely, the whole world narrowing down to that one place, that one moment. The night air felt thick, heavy, like it was closing in around me, and the coldness in my chest had deepened, spreading out to every part of me.

I looked up, desperate, and realized with growing horror that I wasn‚Äôt alone.

There were more of them.

The shadows around the house began to shift and move, figures emerging from the darkness. Faceless, just like the one at the door. They glided toward me silently, their movements unnatural, jerking, as if they were somehow caught between this world and another. There were at least a dozen now, surrounding the house, slowly closing in.

My pulse spiked. This wasn‚Äôt just a nightmare anymore‚Äîit was a trap. The house had *lured* me back, just like it had probably done to my grandfather, just like it had done to whoever had made that cursed tape. And now‚Ä¶ now I was next.

I turned, forcing my legs to move, trying to run again. But before I could take more than two steps, something cold and invisible gripped my ankle, yanking me off balance. I fell hard to the ground, the breath knocked from my lungs. I clawed at the dirt, desperate to pull myself free, but the force held me tight, dragging me back toward the house.

I thrashed, kicked, but nothing I did made any difference. The pull was too strong. I was getting closer to the house, inch by inch, the faceless figure still standing in the doorway, waiting. The others‚Äîthe ones in the shadows‚Äîstood still, watching. They didn‚Äôt need to move. They knew I was already theirs.

My nails scraped uselessly against the dirt as I was dragged closer to the porch steps. The whispers had returned in full force, louder now, echoing inside my skull until it felt like my head might split open. I could feel the cold seeping into my bones, freezing me from the inside out, dulling my senses. The world around me blurred at the edges, my vision narrowing until the only thing I could see was that open door.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

The words dripped with malice now, no longer gentle or coaxing. This was a command.

The figure in the doorway took a step forward.

I screamed‚Äîloud, desperate, and guttural‚Äîas I thrashed with everything I had left, every ounce of energy I could muster. My hand reached out and grasped something cold and solid‚Äîa broken piece of stone lying in the dirt. Without thinking, I swung it behind me, slamming it into the ground near my ankle.

There was a horrible screech‚Äîa sound that didn‚Äôt belong in this world. The grip around my ankle loosened for a split second, and I took my chance. I scrambled to my feet, adrenaline surging through me, and ran.

I didn‚Äôt know where I was going, didn‚Äôt care, as long as it was away from that house, away from whatever had been waiting for me inside. My heart pounded in my ears, the whispers fading slightly as I put more distance between myself and the house. The figures didn‚Äôt follow. They didn‚Äôt need to. I could still feel them. Watching. Waiting.

But I wasn‚Äôt out yet. I knew that. Whatever this was, whatever had been unleashed, it wasn‚Äôt confined to that house anymore.

It was everywhere now.

I kept running, my body numb, my mind racing, until I reached the road. The car was still there, sitting silent and abandoned where I had left it. I fumbled with the door, my hands shaking, but I managed to get it open and collapsed into the driver‚Äôs seat. My fingers trembled as I jammed the key into the ignition and turned it.

The engine sputtered to life, and I floored the gas, peeling away from the house. I didn‚Äôt look back. I couldn‚Äôt.

The whispers, though quieter now, still echoed in the back of my mind. They always would.

I knew then, as I drove through the empty streets, that there was no escaping this. No matter where I went, no matter how far I ran, the house had left its mark on me. It had opened something‚Äîsomething that couldn‚Äôt be closed.

And it was only a matter of time before it came back for me.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

For days after I fled the house, I barely slept. When I did, the nightmares always dragged me back there‚Äîstanding in front of the open door, the faceless figure waiting in the dark. The whispers followed me, even when I was awake, echoing faintly at the edge of my thoughts like a constant reminder that I was never truly alone.

I thought maybe distance would help. I packed a bag and drove as far as I could, not stopping until I‚Äôd crossed into another state. I checked into a motel, far from the house and anything that reminded me of that place. For a moment, sitting in the stark, brightly lit room, I allowed myself to believe that I might be safe.

But the truth crept in slowly, seeping through the cracks of my false hope.

The first sign came that night. I had left the TV on, hoping the noise would drown out my thoughts and help me sleep. But sometime around midnight, the static began. Just a faint buzz at first, but soon, the channels flickered, switching to nothing but snow, the same way they had on the old TV in my grandfather‚Äôs house. My blood ran cold as the screen briefly went black, and for a moment, I swore I saw the outline of a figure standing there, just beyond the edge of the static.

I shut the TV off immediately, heart pounding, but the damage had been done. I could feel it again‚Äîthat creeping presence. The sense of being watched.

The whispers started up shortly after. At first, they were faint, barely audible under the hum of the motel‚Äôs cheap air conditioner. But as the hours passed, they grew louder, persistent. I tossed and turned in bed, pulling the covers over my head like a child afraid of the dark, but the whispers seeped through.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

It didn‚Äôt matter where I went. The house had latched onto me. It had followed me, not just physically, but in some deeper, more insidious way. Wherever I went, it would be there too, waiting for the right moment to pull me back. The whispers weren‚Äôt going to stop. They were only going to get worse.

And then I realized something.

I wasn‚Äôt the first.

My grandfather had been quiet about his past, but there had always been hints. Strange absences. Odd behavior. The way he‚Äôd avoid certain parts of the house as if they carried some unspeakable weight. When I‚Äôd found the VHS tape, I hadn‚Äôt thought much about why it had been hidden, why it was buried so deep in the attic. But now I understood.

He had known. He‚Äôd experienced this too. Maybe not with the same tape, maybe not even with the same whispers. But something had haunted him. Something had followed him.

Suddenly, it made sense why my grandfather had become so distant in his final years, why he‚Äôd stopped inviting anyone to visit, why the house had fallen into such disrepair. He hadn‚Äôt abandoned it. He‚Äôd been *trapped* by it. Just like I was.

And now, the only way out seemed impossible.

My hands shook as I dialed the number of my best friend, Jake. I hadn‚Äôt told him much about the house, just that I was sorting through things, dealing with the estate. He didn‚Äôt know what had happened‚Äînot really. But if anyone could talk me down from the edge, it was him.

The phone rang twice before he picked up, his voice groggy. ‚ÄúDude, it‚Äôs 2 a.m. You okay?‚Äù

I hesitated, staring at the flickering shadows in the corner of the motel room. ‚ÄúJake, I need help. I‚ÄîI don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, slow down. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

I tried to explain, but the words felt hollow, insane, like a nightmare that shouldn‚Äôt be real. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶ I think the house is following me.‚Äù

There was a long pause on the other end of the line, and when Jake spoke again, his tone had shifted from grogginess to concern. ‚ÄúAre you still at your grandfather‚Äôs place?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I left. But it‚Äôs not just the house. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ more than that.‚Äù I was shaking now, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like something came out of the house with me. Something‚Ä¶ wrong.‚Äù

He sighed, and I could hear him sitting up in bed. ‚ÄúLook, man, you‚Äôre freaked out. That place has bad vibes, I get it. But whatever you‚Äôre feeling‚Äîit‚Äôs just stress. You‚Äôve been dealing with a lot. Why don‚Äôt you come over here? We‚Äôll talk it out. You can stay at my place for a while. Clear your head.‚Äù

I wanted to believe him. I wanted so badly for this to be just stress, just some irrational paranoia brought on by the trauma of the last few days. But the whispers‚Ä¶ they were getting louder again, rising in the background of my thoughts, pushing against the thin barrier of reality I was trying to hold onto.

I clenched my teeth, trying to focus on Jake‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll head your way in the morning. I just need to get some sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll figure it out. You‚Äôre not alone in this, okay?‚Äù

I muttered a thanks and hung up, trying to take comfort in his words. But deep down, I knew I wasn‚Äôt going to sleep tonight. Not with the whispers crawling beneath my skin, scratching at the walls of my mind.

I lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling, forcing myself to breathe slowly. In and out. In and out.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

I squeezed my eyes shut.

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

It wasn‚Äôt real. I wouldn‚Äôt let it be real.

But then, somewhere in the room, I heard it. The creak of a floorboard. The faint, deliberate sound of something shifting in the shadows.

My eyes snapped open, and there, standing at the foot of the bed, was the faceless figure.

It had found me.

And this time, I knew there was no escape.

I froze, my breath catching in my throat as the faceless figure stood silently at the foot of the bed. The room seemed to close in around me, the air thick with the cold, oppressive presence of the thing I had been running from. It was no longer just a whisper in the back of my mind‚Äîit was here, in the flesh, waiting for me to make a move.

I didn‚Äôt dare blink, didn‚Äôt dare breathe too loudly, afraid that the slightest sound or movement would provoke it. It tilted its head, almost curiously, as if studying me. Its smooth, featureless face offered no expression, but I could feel its intent. It wasn‚Äôt just here to haunt me‚Äîit was here to *take* me.

For a long moment, neither of us moved. My mind was screaming at me to run, to do something, but my body was frozen in place, locked in the grip of pure terror. I could feel the weight of it pressing down on me, the cold seeping into my bones, chilling me from the inside out.

And then, as if responding to my thoughts, the whispers began again.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

The figure took a step closer.

I scrambled backward, instinct taking over as I tumbled off the side of the bed, my hands slapping against the cold floor as I tried to push myself up. My heart was racing, pounding so hard I could barely think. The room seemed to spin, the walls warping as the figure loomed closer, its presence growing heavier, darker.

I could hear the whispers all around me now, louder than ever, filling the air with a relentless, droning chant. The words blurred together, overlapping, until they were all I could hear.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

I crawled backward, my hands and knees skidding across the floor as I tried to get away, but no matter how far I moved, the figure was always just a step behind me. It was as if the room itself was shrinking, trapping me in this awful, suffocating space.

Finally, I reached the door, fumbling for the handle with trembling fingers. My whole body was shaking, my muscles screaming with the effort to keep moving, to escape. I yanked the door open and stumbled out into the hallway, gasping for air as I slammed the door shut behind me.

For a moment, I stood there, my back pressed against the door, my chest heaving. The whispers had stopped. The motel hallway was empty, eerily silent, the fluorescent lights flickering weakly above me. I took a few shaky breaths, trying to calm myself, trying to convince myself that I had outrun it.

But deep down, I knew better.

The door behind me creaked.

I turned slowly, dread pooling in my stomach as the handle began to turn, ever so slightly. My mind screamed at me to run, to get out, but my body refused to move, paralyzed by the sheer, overwhelming terror that gripped me.

The door swung open.

The faceless figure stepped into the hallway.

And this time, it wasn‚Äôt alone.

Behind it, emerging from the shadows of the motel room, came more figures. Dozens of them, all faceless, all moving with the same jerky, unnatural motions. They flooded into the hallway, their presence sucking the warmth from the air, the lights above flickering more violently now. I backed away, my breath coming in short, panicked gasps as they closed in, surrounding me, cutting off any chance of escape.

I was trapped.

The whispers returned, louder and more insistent than ever.

*‚ÄúCome home.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúCome back.‚Äù*

The figures moved closer, their cold, empty faces tilted toward me. I could feel their gaze on me, even though they had no eyes, no features at all. The cold seeped into my skin, crawling up my spine, freezing me in place. I couldn‚Äôt run. I couldn‚Äôt fight.

And then, from within the mass of faceless figures, one of them stepped forward. Taller than the others, its head tilted slightly in that same unsettling way.

It spoke.

Not in a whisper this time, but in a voice that vibrated through the air, deep and hollow.

*‚ÄúYou belong to us now.‚Äù*

My body went numb. I tried to scream, but no sound came out. The figures moved closer, surrounding me, their cold, unnatural hands reaching out, brushing against my skin. The cold was unbearable now, spreading through me like ice. I could feel them pulling me, dragging me down, down into the darkness.

I thrashed, struggling to break free, but their grip was too strong. The world around me faded, the motel hallway dissolving into a blur of shadows and whispers. The cold deepened, sinking into my bones, pulling me into the void.

And then, as the darkness closed in around me, I realized the truth.

There was no escaping them. There never had been.

I had opened the door.

And now, I was theirs.

I have never had a cavity or any serious dental issues that have required surgery, but after going to the dentist just last week, the doctor doubled down on asking if I really don't smoke (I don't). He said my teeth had enamel staining and decay that looked like it.

One thing I did not tell him is that I have been struggling with bullimia (though I'd say I've been stable and safe since August) for years, and after quick google searches, I'm wondering if that could be the cause of my problem. Outside of this, the other thing I do that could stain my teeth from my knowledge is drink quite a bit of coffee, but I'm not sure if that would cause erosion.

Can this be the cause, and if so, should I be sharing this with my dentist? Is there any way to fix the damage?

Here, I've expanded it to share the origins of my pain. We've all had to deal with them, coming around and telling us how wrong we are and how they can straighten us out, whether they're kooky family members or traveling strangers... 

For background, I lost my Granny to some dumb cult. My oldest and youngest aunts looped her into the shit and convinced her to sell everything she had and run off to the Holy Land with them, to await the coming of the End of the World at some place called ""The Aerie"" (that's an eagle's nest, an aerie). Before this, my brother and I would take turns spending Friday night with her, rummaging through the insanely varied souvenirs collected over a few decades of being a travel agent- tribal masks and weapons from Africa and South America and Asia, snacks from scores of different countries, stories like squat toilets in SE Asia and the first Coca Cola vendors in China who had one glass, repeatedly used and washed, used and washed, for a few ounces of Coke... Saturday morning, we'd eat savory-spiced popcorn for breakfast and watch Saturday Morning Cartoons, starting with the Smurfs. My younger cousins didn't know this Granny; they just knew the kook who turned Every Damn Sentence into some shit about Jesus. She was simply insufferable when the world didn't end and came back to America. I was back from college when she stayed with us for a while (no more belongings, no townhome, no car, no job, just Jesus). And for all of my love for her, for all of the good memories, the reverence for the Grand Mom who divorced the mean bastard Grand Father of the family back when women in this country didn't do that, I just couldn't sit there and have every conversation hijacked to Jesusville. I finally realized that my Granny was gone, that this was a different person now. When I finally snapped, I stopped her in mid-sentence, ""But Jesu..."" with ""Granny, I love you dearly but we don't talk anymore. We don't have conversations or reminisce or tell stories. I say something and you say ""Jesus"". And that's not a relationship. That's not human interaction. So we're gonna do something different now. Anytime, every time you say ""Jesus"", I'm gonna say ""buttsex"". 
And I did. For the next four months she lived with us and forever after that. And I hope to hell she told Jesus about it every damn night!

Second Part: Young Mormons each take a missionary year out into the wilderness to share their gospel with us heathens. At the end of that year, they pass their bicycle and helmet down to the next kid in line.

I worked in a bicycle shop that, for whatever reason, was known amongst these intrepid peckerwoods, so I saw lots of them. And, for anyone who doesn't know a bike geek, we spot specific bikes like cowboys spot specific horses, so I got to recognize a lot of those bikes.

When I moved into my own apartment, I moved to the open-minded part of town (it's been called ""the Gayborhood""), on the ground floor of a small six-plex right on the main drag; I could look out my front door at downtown, with bars, clubs, and pawn shops lining the street along the way. Lots of heathens in my 'hood.

So, with this easy access and this seeming ""need for Jeebus"", my door was an easy mark for missionaries.

Early one hot Saturday afternoon, I got a knock at my door. There were two missionaries outside, uniformly-garbed and identifiable in their short-sleeved white button-up shirts, khakis, backpacks, and bike helmets; I recognized the bikes they were riding and I knew what they were about to say... As they asked their same old question about their same old gospel, I smiled, came outside and showed them how to lock their bikes more securely before shooing them inside, ""It's hot already, boys!"".

I sat them down and got Blue Bell ice cream and bowls and spoons. ""Pepsi?"" I asked from the kitchen; ""Please!"" came the reply (Mormons don't do coffee or tea but caffeinated soda somehow straddles a line for them- some do, some don't).

So I serve them and settle down with my own. For folks that have few indulgences, ice cream and cold Pepsi is just fun for this heathen to watch them with... Big smiles all around. I stifled the urge to play some music, didn't have the TV on, just let them enjoy.

When they finished their scoop of ice cream each (vanilla, natch) and had stopped sweating, they each took a moment to look at each other and then at me.

Sensing what was about to happen, I gently took the initiative; ""Brothers. (oratorical pause) Brothers, where Our Almighty God sees all, what is the one thing that makes every man and woman equal?""

They looked at each other, almost in amazement, thinking their day was about to get productive, or at least interesting. I watched as they processed this stimulus, almost as if I could hear them tingling.

Before the more forward one could answer, I again took the initiative and answered my own question: ""Brothers, under the eyes of Our Lord, buttsex renders equal every man and woman upon His earth.""

And, like Lot's wife turning into a pillar of salt before my very eyes, FWOOSH!! those two chairs were instantly vacated, with naught left behind but two clouds of vapor shaped like sprinting missionaries and a little spilled ice cream.

But that old carpet had seen much, MUCH worse...",40,1728949764.0,pettyrevenge,8,0.82,False

1g3u9p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1g3u9p1/my_parents_disappear_every_halloween/,My Parent's Disappear every Halloween,"I don‚Äôt mean they‚Äôd leave for a party or a night out. No, they‚Äôd vanish‚Äîgone without a trace by sunset, leaving me alone in the house. I‚Äôd search for them, call their names, but they were always gone, like they‚Äôd never existed. It wasn‚Äôt something we ever talked about. The next morning, they‚Äôd be back, acting as if nothing had happened, like it was just another night. But it wasn‚Äôt. I knew that. I learned that the hard way.

It all started when I was six years old. I remember that first Halloween like it was yesterday. I was dressed as a witch, excited to go trick-or-treating. But just as the sun dipped below the horizon, I noticed the house felt different‚Äîcold, quiet, too quiet. I ran through the halls, calling for my mom and dad, but no one answered. Panic set in. I thought maybe they were hiding, playing a prank, but after what felt like hours of searching, I realized they were gone. The front door was locked, the windows were shut, and I was completely alone. 

That‚Äôs when I found the first note.

It was on the kitchen table, written in my mom‚Äôs familiar handwriting. It simply said:  

Rule 1: **‚Äú*****Stay in your room. Do not come out until sunrise. Whatever you hear, ignore it.‚Äù***

I didn‚Äôt understand then. I was scared, confused, and alone. I didn‚Äôt want to stay in my room; I wanted to find my parents. But something about the note made me follow the instructions. I took a flashlight and a pillow, locked myself in my room, and crawled under the covers. I thought maybe it was some kind of weird game. I wasn‚Äôt sure.

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep much. The house creaked and groaned, more than usual. I heard strange noises‚Äîsoft scratching at my door, footsteps in the hallway, whispers that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. I told myself it was the wind or my imagination, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt. Something was in the house with me.

The next morning, when I opened my door, my parents were back. They were sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee like nothing had happened. I asked them where they‚Äôd gone, what had happened, but they just smiled and said I must have had a bad dream.

That was the beginning.

Every Halloween after that was the same. My parents would disappear just before nightfall, leaving me alone with a note. Each year, the instructions got a little more specific, a little more ominous. By the time I was eight, the notes included things like: 

Rule 2: ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look out the windows.‚Äù*** and Rule 3: ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt respond if someone calls your name.‚Äù*** 

And the noises‚Äîthey got worse.

One year, when I was nine, the sounds outside my room became unbearable. There were knocks on the door, not gentle, but loud, insistent pounding. I pressed my hands over my ears, squeezing my eyes shut, but I couldn‚Äôt block it out. The voice on the other side was familiar‚Äîmy mother‚Äôs voice, calling my name.

‚ÄúEllie, it‚Äôs okay. You can come out now.‚Äù She sounded so calm, so normal. For a second, I almost believed it was really her. But the rule had been clear: ‚ÄúDo not open the door, no matter what you hear.‚Äù

So I didn‚Äôt. I stayed under the covers, trembling, until the knocking stopped. I never told my parents about the voice, and they never asked.

The years passed, and the game continued. It became a twisted Halloween tradition. While other kids dressed up and collected candy, I stayed locked in my room, listening to the house come alive with things I couldn‚Äôt see. I became used to the notes, the strange noises, and the feeling of being watched. It was all part of the game, my own haunted ritual.

But when I turned thirteen, everything changed.

That year, the note was different. I found it on my bed just as the sun was setting, but instead of the usual instructions, it said: 

Rule 4: ***‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something new in the house tonight. Be careful.‚Äù***

I didn‚Äôt know what that meant, but the moment I read it, I felt a chill run down my spine. Something new? What did that mean? I locked my door, as usual, and tried to settle in for the night, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.

The noises started earlier than usual. At first, it was the familiar creaks and footsteps. I‚Äôd gotten used to those. But then, there was something else‚Äîbreathing. I could hear it, low and heavy, just outside my door. It wasn‚Äôt human. It was too slow, too deep. I pressed myself against the headboard, clutching my flashlight like a weapon, even though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt help.

The breathing moved away after a while, but then came the scratching. It wasn‚Äôt at my door this time‚Äîit was coming from inside my room. I whipped the flashlight around, scanning the walls, the ceiling, but there was nothing. The scratching grew louder, closer, until it felt like it was coming from beneath my bed. My heart pounded in my chest, my throat dry with fear. I didn‚Äôt dare look under the bed. I was too scared of what I might find.

The scratching stopped abruptly, replaced by a soft, childlike giggle. The sound of it froze the blood in my veins. It wasn‚Äôt me. It wasn‚Äôt my parents. Something was in the room with me.

I backed up against the wall, holding the flashlight out in front of me like it could protect me from whatever was there. The giggling continued, soft and mocking. I whispered to myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real. It‚Äôs just a game.‚Äù But I didn‚Äôt believe it anymore.

Suddenly, there was a loud bang on the door. The whole room seemed to shake with the force of it. I dropped the flashlight, plunging myself into darkness. The breathing was back, but this time, it was right outside my door.

Bang!

Another hit. The door shuddered.

Bang!

The lock rattled. Whatever was out there was trying to get in.

I scrambled to pick up the flashlight, but my hands were shaking so badly I could barely hold it. The banging grew more violent, each hit sounding like the door was about to give in. And then, just as suddenly as it started, it stopped.

Silence. Pure, deafening silence.

I held my breath, waiting, listening for any sign of movement. Then, the voice returned, soft and sweet, like honey.

‚ÄúEllie, it‚Äôs okay. You can come out now.‚Äù

It was my mother‚Äôs voice again, but this time, I knew it wasn‚Äôt her. I didn‚Äôt answer. I didn‚Äôt move. I just sat there, frozen in fear, praying for the night to end.

The voice called out again, more insistent this time. ‚ÄúEllie, don‚Äôt be scared. It‚Äôs just a game.‚Äù

My hands were trembling, and I could barely hold onto the flashlight. The voice kept calling, but I stayed silent. I knew the rules. I knew I couldn‚Äôt open the door. But then, something strange happened. The door... it began to unlock. I heard the soft click of the lock turning, and the handle slowly twisted.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I whispered, pressing myself further against the wall, willing the door to stay shut. But it was too late. The door creaked open, just a crack, but enough for me to see a shadow in the hallway, something tall and thin, its limbs too long, its fingers clawed.

It wasn‚Äôt my mother.

The creature stood in the doorway, unmoving, watching me. I could feel its eyes on me, even though I couldn‚Äôt see its face. My heart was pounding in my chest, and I felt like I might pass out.

And then, just as it stepped forward, the first rays of sunlight crept through the window. The creature recoiled, hissing like an animal, and within seconds, it was gone. The door slammed shut, and the house was quiet again.

I didn‚Äôt leave my room until the sun was fully up. When I finally opened the door, the house was just as it had been the night before‚Äîsilent, empty, as if nothing had happened.

My parents were back, sitting at the kitchen table, drinking coffee like they always did. I stumbled in, shaken and pale, and told them everything‚Äîthe creature, the scratching, the voice that wasn‚Äôt my mother‚Äôs. They just looked at me, exchanged glances, and then my dad laughed softly.

‚ÄúYou must have had a bad dream,‚Äù he said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúNothing like that happened, Ellie. It was just your imagination.‚Äù

My mom smiled that same strange smile and added, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe now. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù

But I knew better. I knew it wasn‚Äôt just a dream. The fear, the things I‚Äôd heard and seen‚Äîthey were real. They had to be. My parents didn‚Äôt believe me, they never did, and that was the most terrifying part.

Now, as an adult with children of my own, I know the truth. Whatever haunted me in that house, whatever played that sick game, it‚Äôs still out there, waiting. And it‚Äôs hungry. I fear for the lives of my children. I‚Äôll never let them go through what I went through. I‚Äôll protect them at all costs, even if it means never celebrating Halloween, never letting the night touch them the way it touched me.

Because I know, deep down, that it‚Äôs only a matter of time before the game starts again. Halloween is coming",1,1728949500.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

No, they‚Äôd vanish‚Äîgone without a trace by sunset, leaving me alone in the house. I‚Äôd search for them, call their names, but they were always gone, like they‚Äôd never existed. It wasn‚Äôt something we ever talked about. The next morning, they‚Äôd be back, acting as if nothing had happened, like it was just another night. But it wasn‚Äôt. I knew that. I learned that the hard way.

It all started when I was six years old. I remember that first Halloween like it was yesterday. I was dressed as a witch, excited to go trick-or-treating. But just as the sun dipped below the horizon, I noticed the house felt different‚Äîcold, quiet, too quiet. I ran through the halls, calling for my mom and dad, but no one answered. Panic set in. I thought maybe they were hiding, playing a prank, but after what felt like hours of searching, I realized they were gone. The front door was locked, the windows were shut, and I was completely alone. 

That‚Äôs when I found the first note.

It was on the kitchen table, written in my mom‚Äôs familiar handwriting. It simply said:    
  
Rule 1: ***‚ÄúStay in your room. Do not come out until sunrise. Whatever you hear, ignore it.‚Äù***

I didn‚Äôt understand then. I was scared, confused, and alone. I didn‚Äôt want to stay in my room; I wanted to find my parents. But something about the note made me follow the instructions. I took a flashlight and a pillow, locked myself in my room, and crawled under the covers. I thought maybe it was some kind of weird game. I wasn‚Äôt sure.

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep much. The house creaked and groaned, more than usual. I heard strange noises‚Äîsoft scratching at my door, footsteps in the hallway, whispers that I couldn‚Äôt quite make out. I told myself it was the wind or my imagination, but deep down, I knew it wasn‚Äôt. Something was in the house with me.

The next morning, when I opened my door, my parents were back. They were sitting at the kitchen table, sipping coffee like nothing had happened. I asked them where they‚Äôd gone, what had happened, but they just smiled and said I must have had a bad dream.

That was the beginning.

Every Halloween after that was the same. My parents would disappear just before nightfall, leaving me alone with a note. Each year, the instructions got a little more specific, a little more ominous. By the time I was eight, the notes included things like: 

Rule 2: ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look out the windows.‚Äù*** and Rule 3: ***‚ÄúDon‚Äôt respond if someone calls your name.‚Äù*** 

And the noises‚Äîthey got worse.

One year, when I was nine, the sounds outside my room became unbearable. There were knocks on the door, not gentle, but loud, insistent pounding. I pressed my hands over my ears, squeezing my eyes shut, but I couldn‚Äôt block it out. The voice on the other side was familiar‚Äîmy mother‚Äôs voice, calling my name.

**‚ÄúEllie, it‚Äôs okay. You can come out now.‚Äù** She sounded so calm, so normal. For a second, I almost believed it was really her. But the rule had been clear: ***‚ÄúDo not open the door, no matter what you hear.‚Äù***

So I didn‚Äôt. I stayed under the covers, trembling, until the knocking stopped. I never told my parents about the voice, and they never asked.

My husband and I have been married for a few months and living together for a year now. He works a lot of hours because he makes good money and gets premium pay, and in the colder months, he works 7 days a week with a few overtime shifts a week. It's not a very physical or mentally draining job so that's why he does it. There's always been mild issues with him being on his phone too much, especially during certain sports seasons. I've complained many times about him sitting next to me but not be ""there"" and I when I bring it up, it usually gets better until the week after where the same thing is happening. 

I'll give a specific example that has happened a few times prior. He's been on afternoon shift for 3 weeks now and I only see him when he gets home at 11:30 pm which by that point, I'm already tucked into bed. This weekend, he got to work a day shift on Sunday and would have to work an afternoon shift on Monday which would give us the whole night to spend together which we were both looking forward to. He got home from work yesterday and went straight to the TV to watch a football game, then we had dinner while he was still watching the game. After it was done, he laid down on the couch and went on his phone. I waited for him to get off it so we can watch a movie. He stayed on it for some time and I just put a random movie on. He noticed that I put a movie on and FINALLY put his phone down. 5 minutes later, he falls asleep at 7 pm and didn't wake up until 11am the next day, which is today. I realized he was tired so I just thought that we could spend the morning together before he goes into work.

Anyway, today, he woke up and didn't cuddle me in bed while I was laying down next to him, he got up and makes us both a coffee then drinks it while on his phone. I kept asking him to put it down and he kept saying that he will in a bit. I told him that he didn't spend the time together last night but it would be nice to go for a walk at the park with out dog which he said is a good idea. He stayed on his and when he didn't get off it, I got very frustrated and started cleaning the house. He noticed that I was upset and finally came to hug me and I started telling him that I'm done asking him for attention and this isn't a good way to start our marriage. He didn't really say much and didn't look at me or talk to me for the next few hours until he left to go to work.

I don't know if I'm overreacting. It's just the little things that matter to me and I don't ask him for much. I just want him to be present when he's with me and I've said this to him many times before. If it's like this at the beginning of our marriage, then who knows how it will be a few years from now.

  
TLDR, my husband is never really ""present"" with me. He's always on his phone and I don't get my needs met.",0,1728949369.0,relationship_advice,4,0.33,False

Every year I go through the pantry and donate anything I won‚Äôt use, bought too many of, things my daughter liked until I bought it in bulk, etc. (I make sure nothing is expired). This year in addition to the typical items, I have several bottles of bbq sauce and wing sauces from a charity raffle basket I won, salad dressings, and multiple big bottles of flavored coffee syrups. I had planned to donate these as well until another school mom made a comment that it was tacky and out of touch, since those are ‚Äúluxuries‚Äù and won‚Äôt help people who need actual food.

At one time when I was much younger, I was in a very bad place in life and frequently relied on food banks to survive. I‚Äôm very fortunate now to be in a much better place in life and in a position to be able to help other people. It was such a dark time for me and made me feel so ashamed and low. If I had gotten something like a bottle of sauce to add to meals or a coffee syrup to make a fancy coffee drink, that would have been such a special treat and added a little bright spot in such an awful situation. Just having something more than bare necessities would have felt incredible. However the comments from the other mom have made me second guess myself. In no way would I want to come across as insulting or tone deaf. What are your thoughts?

Memory transcript subject: Sebastian Northrop, Terran refugee¬†

Standardized Human time:¬†October 17th, 2136  


Void, blackness, slowly the stars came into view, *fuck not again!* This time, closer to earth, closer to *home.* Looking at my feet, I was standing on the moon as it circled earth at quite the breakneck speed If I thought about it. Everything looked to be in order, our little ball of dirt and water looking as pristine as ever. There wasn‚Äôt a single warship in sight, looking down as I passed into earth's shadow I grabbed a handful of the soft sandy lunar soil, it felt like kinetic sand in my hands as I let it fall between my fingers.¬†



As it slowly floated down back to its original resting spot, the tranquility was broken by hellish screams, looking around I couldn't tell where it was coming from. But the screams got louder and more desperate! Looking back up at earth, I saw the lights of our most populated cities‚Ä¶*the screams of agony coming from there!* My jaw dropped as darkness took over the populated areas like a plague, lives were getting extinguished with the lights! I covered my ears and looked away but the screams didn‚Äôt stop, they only got louder, more guttural! ***Fear! Loss! Anger! Sadness! Agony!*** *Every negative emotion portrayed in their screams!* 

Just as I added my own screams to the hellish choir‚Ä¶they stopped without warning,¬†the only sound left was my own whimpering among the stars. Turning around as the moon turned to face the day side, every continent is pocked with mind shattering craters where the cities once were! most of the British-isles, along both coasts of the US and scattered across the Americas, most of Europe, a majority of Asia and India and the Japanese home islands were just gone‚Ä¶***GONE!***



‚ÄúIMPOSSIBLE!‚Äù I screamed in rage, *as if anyone was left to hear me*‚Ä¶no continent was spared, where the fertile crescent once was, is now glass, the African savanna and the amazon where ablaze, I could see the flames lash out towards the heavens from here! The American plains were scorched, the green grass now a dead, sickly yellow, Europe and Scandinavia was nothing but bare rock! the south Asian rain forests, flattened! The only part of Oceania left was the rusty peaks of Australia. A tear rolled off my cheek and hit the lunar soil‚Ä¶it's all gone! Earth is no longer recognizable!¬†



My friends, my family, innocent lives taken indiscriminately, man and beast alike! no trial given, no chance to truly state our case! My sorrow was interrupted when the ground under my feet started shaking and a deafening rumble filled my head. A large crack formed under me! Frozen in fear I couldn‚Äôt move but could only watch as the crack formed into a crevice then a cavern, the moon was swallowing me whole! Screaming as I fell, the sandy soil followed to bury me when I hit the bottom, soon darkness consumed me.



Full of adrenaline I jumped out of bed ready to fight off anything that threatened me and my people. I was in a cold sweat as I slowly came to realize I was safe, Yua looked scared shitless before I relaxed my stance ‚ÄúSeb! Is everything alright?!?‚Äù she asked me, I could feel that something wasn‚Äôt okay, I couldn‚Äôt tell her what but, *something* was wrong, *something* had me fearing for my life! ‚ÄúS-sure, sure‚Ä¶j-just need some water‚Äù I mumbled before shuffling off to the bathroom, I looked at myself in the mirror, it took me a moment to recognize the crazy person looking at me ‚Äúgod, look at you, get ahold of yourself!‚Äù I growled at him before putting a cup in the sink and began filling it with water. As the water poured, I dried my face and neck with the hanging towel. I wanted to call my parents, see if they were alright, my sister and her family probably wouldn‚Äôt get reception in the bunker.



After I downed the cup of water the insane man seemed more like himself now that he had a moment, running a hand over my face. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to withstand my calls going unanswered. It‚Äôs too early in the day for me to have a meltdown. Feeling better now I returned to bed, flipping over my now damp pillow to the dry side. My eyes locked into the distance of the ceiling, how could I put my feelings into words? I guess I‚Äôd have to find a way since Yua asked: ‚ÄúWanna talk about it?‚Äù In reality I didn‚Äôt, but with her small paw on my chest, I'm not sure how I couldn't, she deserved to know what I'm feeling!

‚ÄúScreams‚Ä¶so much pain and fear‚Ä¶then, silence‚Ä¶somethings wrong Yua!‚Äù the more I talked about it the more choked up I got and tears started to form, her other little paw came to my face to wipe them away ‚Äúit‚Äôll be okay Seb, your safe, im safe‚Äù she cooed trying to comfort me *she's right‚Ä¶I'm safe‚Ä¶she's safe‚Ä¶everything's‚Ä¶okay*, I had to repeat that line a few times to myself and gently pull Yua into a hug before I felt comfortable enough to close my eyes again. Throughout what felt like the rest of the night I found myself unable to put the right amount of pressure on Yua, hugging her too tight and I feared hurting her, but too loosely and I feared making her feel unwanted.¬†



I was starting to wonder why she even chose to stay with me. I've been proving nothing to her other than I'm a broken man with insecurity leaking out of every pore and have enough anxiety to make a traumatized rabbit seem mellow! This poor Venlil has only seen me at my lowest and I wasn‚Äôt sure when my next high would be‚Ä¶if there even was going to be one. The more I thought about it the more I wondered why she wasn‚Äôt afraid of me. I don't blame him but that Venlil occupying that smooth talking bastard from yesterday looked like he was ready to jump out the window when I snapped. I hope I didn‚Äôt make him afraid that his own human could flip a switch like that.

I remember how the aliens at the star-port looked at me! Only the doctors seem able to stomach my face and even then it was only the more veternized ones who looked like they wished they‚Äôd retire sooner that were brave enough to get close and personal! By her own admission Yua is a doctor of some degree but she looked much younger then the ones who didn‚Äôt act like I was a living bomb! I couldn‚Äôt help but crack a smile at the thought that she picked me because I was the only human that was as mentally ill and deranged as she is, but still sane enough not to lunge or take a swing at her.



I did find it odd that the choices she gave me when it came to terms of sleeping spots that none of them was her going back to her place, I had to wonder if she was homeless and ¬†***just using me!*** *just to get a roof over her head and some credits in her pocket!* But with how unhinged I was acting, I doubt any housing would be worth having to deal with me for the foreseeable future! I guess some would consider this an abusive relationship if we were using each other, I like to see it as more as symbiosis, she gets a roof over her head and doesn‚Äôt have to worry about a job and she prevents me from‚Ä¶*hmpf, I don't even want to think about that.*



If she really was using me I don't think she‚Äôd be in the same bed with me, hell im sure if she didn‚Äôt care for me she wouldn‚Äôt have gone along in trying the lemon. ***My doubts are getting louder!*** *What if she was just doing that to placate me? What if she‚Äôs afraid of upsetting me and walking on eggshells? For christ sake, Northop* ***man up!*** ***Be real!*** *You're just another patient to her! For total strangers, why are you* *this* *comfortable with each other?* ***Am I really that pathetic?*** *I‚Äôve got* ***no one left****‚Ä¶everyone is probably already* ***dead*** *and the only person I got left is this alien stranger who I only met a day ago! How fucking sad! I let everyone die and now I'm cowering like a bitch! latching on to the first person I saw! I'm just a failure!* ***I should just fucking kil-***



My thoughts where stopped by feeling Yua‚Äôs claws digging at my forearm, I realized that in my downward spiral I lost control of my fine motor skills and was squeezing her pretty hard. Once I gained control I couldn't let go of her fast enough and jumped out of bed. Apologizing as fast as my lips could. She coughed a little and looked at me, I wondered if that was fear or pity in her eyes‚Ä¶I couldn‚Äôt stand this room anymore and made for the door ‚Äúi‚Äôm going for a walk‚Äù my destination was unknown but I couldn‚Äôt stay here, I can‚Äôt hurt Yua any more! When my hand turned the knob, the suns rays breaking out from the hallway hurt my eyes. I had no direction, I just couldn‚Äôt be here, I didn‚Äôt want to hurt Yua again. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt leave the apartment‚Ä¶please‚Äù I heard her call out as *whatever blasted time of day it was*, had its light cover me as I entered the hallway.¬†



I couldn‚Äôt help but pace around the apartment, the more my legs moved *the quieter the voices got!* Guess all those years working in the *death trade* were finally getting to me! Years of lying to myself, that I was ‚Äòdoing the right thing‚Äô that I was ‚Äòpreventing unnecessary death‚Äô what a load of **bullshit!** *I hoped I had at least another year or two before it all came crashing down like this!* ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt run from it forever‚Äù my supervisor told me, bet that old fuck is watching me from the beyond having a vindicated laugh to himself right now! ‚ÄúBleeding hearts don't last long in this industry, kid!‚Äù ‚Ä¶Wonder how many med‚Äôs they were gonna put me on, I could only hope that they worked! The last thing I needed to add to my list of things to do to get my life back on track was juggling therapist meetings!



Eventually Venlil Primes extra gravity was feeling stronger and stronger, soon I crashed on the couch. With one pillow between my head and the armrest, one over my face to block out the sun and the blanket over me I fell back into that inky blackness. To my relief this experience didn‚Äôt seem to involve earth or the moon, I was just out in the middle of god knows where floating amongst the stars. How *many of my damn dreams are gonna be space related?*



Normally I'd hate the silence but with the current events I couldn‚Äôt be happier, it was a little chilly out here in the cosmos, not much to do but it sure beat the last two times I was out here! Realization that these constellations were looking oddly familiar couldn‚Äôt have fully formed by the time I woke up to Yua‚Äôs gentle nudging.¬†

I knew it was her because I wasn‚Äôt sure anyone else with a snow white paw would be daring enough to lift the pillow from my face. After my eyes focused on her, I saw those tall ears perk up and she let out a bit of a whistle ‚Äúwakey wakey sleepy head! it‚Äôs already half-past second claw! depression or not, you're not sleeping your days away whilst I'm here!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but smirk, reaching my hand over, I gently rubbed her head and she seemed to press into it a little ‚Äúbesides, I can‚Äôt fold the blanket if your hugging it like that‚Äù I looked down and noticed that I was holding onto it like my life depended on it ‚Äúheh, sorry Yua‚Ä¶also sorry for squeezing you half to death earlier‚Äù ‚Äúshhh, I know you didn‚Äôt mean it‚Äù If I didn‚Äôt know better I‚Äôd think I was still dreaming.



As I let her take the blanket from me I noticed a dark orange splotch poking through her fur on one of her legs ‚Äúwhen‚Äôd that happen?‚Äù part of me was shot with fear, worrying if it was something I had done whilst having an attack! ‚Äúoh, I whacked my leg going to fast up the stairs‚Äù I noticed she had the slightest limp in her gait as she wandered into the kitchen. Processing the smell. I guess she beat me to the punch on cooking breakfast ‚Äúyou sure? You weren‚Äôt limping yesterday‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†



I feared that maybe I did a number on her and just didn‚Äôt remember and she was covering it up so as to not make me remember! If I was seriously harming Yua, I needed to be put in the nearest padded cell, pronto! ‚ÄúWell‚Äù I noticed her ears went flat and there was some orange on her face, was that the color Venlil blush? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make fun of me‚Ä¶too much, but I may have had a Terran painkiller offered by a human elder‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but roll my eyes, a doctor out of anyone should see how foolish that was.



‚ÄúYou're all too trusting Yua, you know that?‚Äù her ears went back and the orange faded ‚ÄúI know I know, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself, I wondered just how trustworthy humans can be, part of me wanted to know if it was *just* you‚Ä¶and my leg was starting to hurt really badly by that point‚Äù I chuckled as I shifted to sit up. By the time I wiped any sleepiness from my eye‚Äôs Yua was putting a plate food in front of me on the coffee table ‚ÄúYua, your treating me better than I deserve‚Äù I admitted, this was treatment a veteran or a doctor like herself deserved ‚Äútoo bad, your gonna eat for your own sake, or so help me if you make me force feed you!‚Äù I rolled my eyes at that threat.



With a smirk I grabbed the fork before she had a chance to enact her statement ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs next you're gonna baby-proof the place?‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tempt me‚Äù she threatened in a playful tone ‚Äúevery cupboard will have a rubber restraint on it, pup-gates in case you start sleepwalking, locking the apartment from the inside, *the works!*‚Äù I saw her tail wag with more force and it was stiffer as it swayed ‚Äúheh, anything to keep your patient safe huh?‚Äù she sat on the couch next to me and lent against me ‚Äúanything for my number one patient‚Äù ‚Äúnow am I your number one because i'm your *only* patient orrr?‚Äù my teasing earned me getting her tail tickling my nose ‚Äúoh hush you and eat.‚Äù¬†



I wondered if the blandness of the food was due to it technically being war times but looking closer at the Venlil on my shoulder I started to notice something on her muzzle‚Ä¶it‚Äôs completely smooth! ‚ÄúOH!‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt withhold that comment to save my life. She looked at me like I had grown a third eye. I was starting to notice that one ear going down must mean they're curious about something ‚Äúsorry, I didn‚Äôt notice your lack of a nose before‚Äù I had to come clean! No way I was brushing off that kind of exclamation!



‚ÄúYou never noticed?‚Äù she giggled ‚Äúthose beady predator eyes and you didn‚Äôt notice my smooth face?‚Äù ‚ÄúThese eyes we‚Äôre made to judge the distance to the next tree branch not inspect alien faces‚Äù my comment seemed to spark something as she shot straight up ‚Äúthat reminds me!‚Äù She got up and reached into the wool on her hips and pulled out a pamphlet with *thee* drawing of a man on it. *So that's where they keep items!* Her tail wag was more fluid this time and she bounced a little, there was a sparkle in her eye as I got the feeling I'm gonna have to explain everything about human biology.¬†



After answering more than twenty questions throughout my bland meal I found that Yua loved learning a lot! I know I sound older than twenty-three saying this but she reminds me of a younger me and now I felt what my parents had to deal with when I first realized I wanted to know what the world was and all the happenings within. I noticed a few things were omitted and tweaked to fit the narrative the UN and Venlil government wanted to spin. Someday I had to tell her that our hunting style wasn‚Äôt ambushing from the tree‚Äôs and spirting down our prey if we missed. And that we didn‚Äôt eat meat just when we ‚Äòhad to‚Äô, whatever that's supposed to mean. I didn't explicitly tell her that those ‚Äòfun facts‚Äô were wrong but I'm sure she was starting to pick up what my noncommittal groans ment.



When I was coming back from putting the empty plate in the sink, I think she started comparing my expression against the figures between her paws. I decided this day was best spent looking up what I could make for dinner tonight with all these limitations, no meat, dairy or eggs‚Ä¶at least they allowed honey‚Ä¶I'm not sure I could live a life where I can't have honey in my tea or in my fruit salad!¬†



I wondered if the Venlil fully understood how honey is really made or they didn‚Äôt question it when the UN told them it was made from pollen. Ignorance is bliss, but man I hoped I could get myself stable before I had to tell Yua the truth. If both of us went unstable then, I think the next time we share a bed would be in a padded cell.¬†



The lack of nose would make the culinary exchange a little difficult, no wonder the orange and lemon almost floored her! Whilst I read about alien food altogether Yua would paw at my shoulder on occasion and practice a human facial expression, at least the best she could and I had to guess which one she was trying to do, slowly she was starting to get it but she struggled with looking angry without my hands ending up petting her head.



I had to model the expression for her and after a while of trying she ran her paws over my face to feel which muscles were contracting, at least that's what she told me. I began to sense an ulterior motive when she felt my chewing muscles‚Ä¶my theory was correct when I had to stop her playing with my hair! She let out some more of those whistling laughs when I picked her up off me and ploping her back in her cushion.

‚Äúits a grave offense in our culture to play with someone's hair like that!‚Äù I faked sounding offended but she gently swatted me with the pamphlet ‚Äúif it‚Äôs such a serious insult they would‚Äôve put it in this, silly!‚Äù I smirked and rolled my eyes before going back to my own reading ‚Äútrusting a piece of paper over your own human, im heart broken Yua‚Äù thankfully I think somewhere in that pamphlet explained how teasing is apart of the bonding process¬†and how humor is a very common coping mechanism, probably doesn‚Äôt help our case on the galactic stage.¬†



I felt bad about not leaving the apartment all day, lazing about like a bum on the couch but Yua didn‚Äôt seem to mind, picking my brain about any questions that the provided information didn‚Äôt seem to answer, I gotta hand it to the UN, they sure know how to make us humans seem like decent folk! The morality of lying to what felt like our only extraterrestrial friends out of fear they‚Äôd toss us out if they learned what a human can really be like dawned on me a little.¬†



The Venlil population as a whole seemed to be almost jumping out of their wool the moment they get within ten feet of a human or see one of our faces! And that's even before knowing what we‚Äôre really like‚Ä¶Then I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder, what made Yua so calm around me? Was she just really good at hiding her feelings or is the Venlil next to me really that insane? Maybe she was dropped on the head as a kid and it disconnected whatever fear wire her people have.¬†



By the time my hunger was starting to get too distracting I noticed that the angle of the sun's rays were a bit different from when I first entered. Checking the time it would take me a bit to fully rationalize what ‚Äúquarter-past third‚Äù meant but the wording ‚Äúevening‚Äù in plain English did the job. Before she had a chance to snatch the opportunity away from me again I lept off the couch and made for the kitchen. The look she gave me made me realize it must‚Äôve looked like I was about to have another episode ‚Äú*I‚Äôm* the one cooking dinner tonight Yua‚Äù I told her and I saw her relax, guess I shouldn't have acted so sprattic.



Seeing what comforts from home Yua‚Äôs government allowed led to limited options to show off true human cuisine, *that and my less than stellar cooking skills.* At least they allowed pasta, presumably because they didn't know the second ingredient in the two ingredient food item. I had to rack my brain, all that time reading was for naught as nothing really stuck in my head!



My Ex was vegetarian, maybe I could try and copy her eggplant parm‚Ä¶wait no cheese‚Ä¶and did they even give us an eggplant in the first place? Opening the fridge to look for my answer I saw the purple vegetable getting chummy with the carrots and cucumber, the whole fridge was divided vertically into Venlil and Earth food, as much as I hated vegan cheese it was better than nothing, but by its absence in the fridge, I guess that was conversation we didn‚Äôt have time for.¬†



I sighed as I picked up the eggplant, so many foods, gone. For our cultures sake I hope we can talk the Venlil into allowing dairy further down the line, supposedly it should be easier to rationalize that to them then eggs would be. Preparing the pot of water to boil and slicing up the eggplant to bake, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what Yua would think of me if she knew how my diet was like on earth. Every food her people stood against on a moral level were staples of almost every human's daily meals in some way or another, guess I can kiss the deli sandwich and pizza goodbye and hello dry lettuce and onion sandwiches.¬†



Vegetable sandwiches didn‚Äôt upset me, Camila always surprised me with how good meat free meals and sandwiches could be but she mainly used mayo or some other sauce that contained eggs or diary to ensure it wasn‚Äôt just a dry mess‚Ä¶I'm glad that they seemed to allow plant butter at the very least! I‚Äôd be shocked if every human kept it together not only with what was *happening* but we couldn‚Äôt even have our comfort foods!¬†



When‚Ä¶*if* something terrible happened to earth I could see everything we‚Äôve built up going away in a flash. ‚ÄúYou take everything but the bread and we‚Äôre afraid to attend the circus, where does that leave us?‚Äù I mumbled to myself before putting the ‚Äòstakes‚Äô in the oven.



When I looked back up I saw Yua giving me a confused ear signal ‚Äún-nothing, nothing‚Äù I assured her. Deep down, I'm not betting on my fellow man to keep being civilized if the federation so much as gets a single hit on earth. My pondering of how much of that thought was projection was interrupted by my eyes burning, hot steam doesn‚Äôt do wonders for the eyes and I guess the boiling water was sick of me staring! Out of my trance I poured the pasta into the upset water to let it cook.



With the lack of so many human staples I couldn‚Äôt help chuckle a little at how many picky children out there who are ‚Äôshit outta luck‚Äô now that we can‚Äôt have mac‚Äôn‚Äôcheese or chicken fingers, god what a stupid name *chicken fingers*, better hope we show them what a is chicken first.



Whilst serving Yua her portion of dinner the peace and tranquility of our night was quickly halted when there was a scream from whoever lived above us! Yua looked at me whilst I was processing what kind of scream it was. I was getting ready to ask her if she would accompany me to check on our neighbor but I was just able to make out ‚ÄúGET AWAY FROM ME!‚Äù before hearing a crash and a thud of something hitting the floor. No word‚Äôs were needed as she quickly hopped up faster than I looked at the couch, I had to catch up with her at the door as she ripped it open.¬†She tried to tell me to stay but I wouldn't listen.



I was beginning to wonder what was causing such a reaction. When we got to the floor above us, there were more screams and crying! Wailing and fits behind every door! I couldn‚Äôt lose focus on our original mission, honing in on the voice we heard before, Yua tried banging on the door but her paws were just too soft! I must‚Äôve been in more of a panic then I thought as with how much I made that door rattle, I thought it was gonna fly off the hinges! 

The neighbor to my left and behind me came out to check on what all that racket was, they looked just as scared and confused I felt, I tried the handle but it was locked. The guy behind looked at me like I lost my mind until we all heard something hit the wall again. ‚ÄúMove!‚Äù he said and the two of us got out of his path of the door. I watched him march right up to the door and put all his force right above the door knob with his heel, *that* managed to get it to fly open. I looked behind me one more time and saw the man had a family, his kid was trying to comfort a Zurarian or whatever those teddy bears are called who was covering their ears and rocking gently whilst the wife tried to stop the kid from getting too close and stressing out the poor fella even more.¬†



Observations were cut short when I felt Yua pull me by the hand inside the panicking women's room, looking at their kitchen there was a charcoal colored Venlil slumped over with orange liquid coming from their head, Yua let go of my hand as we looked at the wounded creature. The man from before and the neighbor from the left tried to calm the women down. The alien was in a daze and there was a significant amount of orange dripping from their fur ‚ÄúSeb, can you carry him downstairs? I'm calling an ambulance!‚Äù Yua barked at me and I did as she told without question, she ripped a few strains of wool out when she pulled out her holopad and called emergency services whilst leading me to the ground floor, I carried the bleeding space sheep as gently as I could whilst she did the talking on the other line.



When we got to the lobby I looked out the glass double doors and saw that the streets were devoid of humans, only aliens who seemed on edge by all the hystericals. Yua pulled me down and had me gently put the patient on a nearby couch before she ran for an emergency med kit that hung on the wall for such an occasion, and took out the gauze to wrap the head wound up. Yua went full doctor mode as she was checking the guy's pulse as adrenaline was still coursing through my veins, whilst I looked over our shoulders for any threats or anyone that needed help.¬†



‚ÄúI gotta go check on the others!‚Äù I told her, who knows what else is happening! what if there's another alien getting tossed and beaten like they were! I ignored Yua‚Äôs yelling as I bolted towards the stairs as if I had no time to lose! It felt like the end of the world but this time I wasn't going to be a coward! *wait‚Ä¶was that glass crashing I heard?* I shook off any hesitation and pounded on all doors the doors I came across asking if those behind it needed any help, I was mostly met with whimpers and ""no""'s 



I opened any unlocked ones that didn't answer looking for any injured or anyone that could need help! One I door opened led to me tackling someone off a chair before they could put their head in the rope loop that hung from the ceiling!

I wrestled them to the ground, holding their hands behind their back until they gave in. ‚ÄúYou're not doing that!‚Äù was the only thing I could think of to shout at the woman before I brought her up and pulled her to the stairs by the wrist like an angry father and ordered her to go down and wait in the lobby. I guess one good thing came out of panic and that‚Äôs if someone sounds big and mean enough, the panicked are more inclined to listen, not guaranteed but more likely.¬†



Going up a floor. What one of those spiky fellas was doing here, was not my business but what was, was the fact that someone was throwing stuff at them whilst chasing them down the hall! As I ran interference, the poor thing mistook me for charging at it, as it just fell on the floor and put up its spikes! The damn critter swiped at my ankles when stepped around it!. Must‚Äôve been confused when I body slammed into the chaser and knocked him on his ass ‚Äúlobby! Now!‚Äù I barked at the hedgehog xeno as it got up and ran with terror. *I don't think beating people while their hysterical is medicine or really helping, but I had to stop them from hurting themselves or others somehow!* ‚ÄúYou're helping them now!?!‚Äù the scrawny guy screamed at me as he got up in a fury, I had to ready myself as he went to punch me.¬†



I had to remember what tiny amount of fighting I knew and just put elbows together and forearms up, too focused to say anything back but grunts and growls of my own. Only had to shove the bean pole down a few more times before he decided to stay down after he took a hard fall. I turned to go to another floor, but when I looked over my shoulder, I realized that he wasn‚Äôt moving all that much. ‚Äúaw fuck!‚Äù escaped my lips as I went to scoop him up.

 ‚Äúthis one‚Äôs my fault‚Äù I admitted to Yua as I laid him out on the carpet, She scowled at me, most likely for my *‚Äòtough love‚Äô* treatment, but logic escaped me as I pointed to the coward in the corner all curled up in ball ‚Äúhe was casing after ‚Äòem!‚Äù She opened her mouth to say something but I didn‚Äôt want to argue. I could start to feel my muscles begin to give in as the adrenaline started to fade out, *fuck that kid did a number on me!*¬†



By the time I got to the upper floors everyone seemed to calm down for the most part, banging on doors only got me whimpers and unlocked doors revealed only empty rooms or people huddled in the corner and under blankets. I was starting to feel how much I strained myself I started to hobble my way down, must‚Äôve whacked my shin on something as by the time I got to the second floor I was in a bit of a limp.

Thankfully the paramedics seemed to get here. But unfortunately they were there just in time to see me trip on the last few steps and eat shit ‚ÄúMOTHER FUCKER!‚Äù I screamed along with other curses and expletives, all I could feel was pain! I just laid on the floor for a bit, unwilling to sit up as I started my own whimper. On the floor is where I remained until Yua forced me to lean against the wall, she shone a light in my eye which only added to my irritation and I quickly swatted it out of my face.



Happy to see that my brain wasn‚Äôt bleeding from that nasty fall, She stayed in front of me and gently held my face whilst talking to me, I didn‚Äôt understand much as I was too focused on tasting blood, took a bit to realize that it was my lip that was bleeding! ‚Äúsir, you should go to the hospital!‚Äù The paramedic told me ‚Äúpshh, i‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù silly Venlil, I wasn‚Äôt knocked out from the fall and my shoulder seemed in place...*but the pain in my leg only grew by the second!*

‚Äúyour bleeding sir!‚Äù I looked to where he was pointing and brushed aside Yua from blocking the view of my leg ‚Äúfucker stuck me!‚Äù I was more shocked than anything, the amount that was leaking past the puncturing spine shot my system with another hit of sweet sweet adrenaline as I realized that it was more than I should be losing! that fall only seemed to push it in deeper.¬†

Seeing that I couldn‚Äôt just shrug this one off I had Yua help me up whilst a teddy bear pushed a gurney towards me. Reality faded in and out when I got in the ambulance, I mustered just enough energy to reach over and hold Yua‚Äôs paw as I was starting to feel cold. When I saw the fear in her eyes, that's how I knew it was getting bad!¬†

I would be hoping to join some bands and play out. Is there much of a live music scene there? If you‚Äôre a band member, do you tend to travel to SLC or Vegas, etc for shows?

For the hunting crowd, are there any public land opportunities? What hunting is good in that area (eg ‚Äògator‚Äô but not ‚Äòzebra‚Äô)?

Is access to coffee a non-issue or something that‚Äôll get you ‚Äúshunned by the community,‚Äù so to speak. 


The photos I‚Äôve seen are beautiful and I live in an area with Mormons (maybe 15% LDS?), but I‚Äôm obviously somewhat potentially sad/concerned about moving to an area I‚Äôd be wholly incompatible with.

Am I just way off base here? Is there cause for concern on my part?

In line with the community guidelines, I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis or thoughts on whether this could be GERD‚ÄîI just want to know if others have gone through something like this.

Each flare is almost the same: intense stomach pain like I‚Äôve been punched, accompanied by acidic burps, followed by (and in conjunction with) a radiating sharp or hot pain in my mid-to-upper back. The stomach and back pain feel connected, but I‚Äôm not sure why.

The triggers vary‚Äîsometimes it starts with back pain from bad posture or exercise soreness, but more often it‚Äôs an acidic, aching stomach pain from something like black coffee or grilled steak. When it gets really bad, the pain is so intense I can‚Äôt sit or lie down, and it can last for hours or even the whole day.

I‚Äôve found some relief with Pepto-Bismol, ginger candy/tea, or lying on my left side. A few years ago, a doctor suggested muscle relaxers for my back pain, but I never tried them since I think the root cause is more related to my stomach.

Has anyone here experienced something like this? I‚Äôm especially interested in hearing from those who‚Äôve also experienced this strange connection between stomach and back pain.",1,1728948071.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1g3tpw7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3tpw7,How can we save our lemon tree?,"We got a lemon tree in August 2024 and it had some unripened (green) lemons plus several flowers (buds). Week 1 we noticed the buds and top leaves of the tree were eaten by deer and also the spot we chose wasn‚Äôt getting even a full 8h of sunlight, so we replanted and surrounded it with a fence/enclosure to protect it a week later. 

At that point it was receiving a full 12h of sunlight daily, and it has been pretty healthy and several lemons have matured. We water it average once every 3-5 days (whenever the soil isn‚Äôt moist), and spray the leaves every 1-2 days. As of month 1 we‚Äôd picked some ripe lemons but noticed the buds had not started to grow back and leaves were slightly starting to yellow, so we started treating it with plant food (nitrogen), on top of the citrus fertilizer we use once a month.

Now we‚Äôre in month 2 and coming out of a 2 week heatwave that took a toll on the tree. The leaves are withered and have started to fall off, as have the remaining lemons (which aren‚Äôt ripe enough to pluck right off). As of the last few weeks, we have occasionally been adding some coffee grounds to the soil as well.

Can this tree be revived and if so, how?

We've been dating for 6.5 months and he took me for coffee and broke up last week. He said he no longer wanted to be in a relationship with me and he wished me all the best, gave me a hug and left. However, he told me the reason he wanted to break up was because of my past and that I wasn't honest..

When I was sixteen my mother had terminal cancer and then died when I was 20. I told him I took drugs, slept around and drank quite a bit for those years. 

Then, when my mother died, I ran into a relationship and got married immediately. I needed someone in my life. I know it was rushed and wrong but it did't matter at the time. Then I divorced 1 year ago and had two partners for 3 months each before meeting my boyfriend. One of them gave me an STD. 

I told him 1 month into meeting him that I was divorced and a month later I told him the divorce wasnt actually finished. He didn't like that the divorce wasn't finished and said something like: is it not better to take time and finish something before you start something new? He also said he didn't want to get involved or ahve anything to do with my divorce.  

Like actually WTF! He's dating me and its part of my life so why would he not want anything to do with it? I know he was right  about not being honest but that's like in my past so who cares?  

Then I tested positive for an STD but I did not tell him for another 2 months because I was afraid he would get angry with me. But I decided to tell him and then omg, he was so pissed that I didn't tell him as soon as I got tested.  He went to the clinic to test himself and it turned out to be negative, he then literally didn't speak to me for 2 days. 

I've been drinking again because work is really stressful and I know I drink too much.  Two weeks ago I drank two bottles of wine on Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday on my own.  My boyfriend got annoyed and told me to reduce the amount that I drink but I just thought he was being controlling. 

Yeah, and now he just decided to break up. It's so freaking not fair. My past does not matter and who cares? I hate people who have freaking ""standards"" or demand ""accountability"" from themselves and their partners. WTF is that patriarchy shit!

This unit is brand new. My mom just bought it but im assuming she just tossed a kcup in and called it good without doing the cleansing brew (good luck if true what with anti fungal sprays and sterilant causing mutation)

I cant get anything to pump through the unit. I tried priming it with the 8oz button like the instructions say and aside from taking this thing apart and questioning the price point idk what to do.

1g3tkrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1g3tkrf/dog_with_vestibular_disease_wont_pee_help/,Dog with vestibular disease won't pee - help! ,"* **Name:** Bailey, Mr. B., Fuzzbutt McGee, Floofster 
* **Species:** dog
* **Age:** 9 years 11mo
* **Sex/Neuter status:** male, neutered
* **Breed:** Australian shepherd mix
* **Body weight:** 39 pounds
* **History:** 
   * **General History:**Bailey was a very healthy rescue until this year. He had a knack of eating things he wasn't supposed to, but had no major vet visits outside of the ""he needs to barf this coffee / chocolate covered fruit / etc. up asap"" variety) 
   * **Last 6 months:** He had an (ideopathic?) Vestibular event in May. Had nystagmus, very poor coordination, nausea, loss of appetite. He made significant progress days 3-6 & was 90% recovered within three weeks. He still has some issues with balance going downstairs. This led to two instances (one in June & one in August) of significant back pain after taking a tumble. He was treated with Rimadyl and Gabapentin the first time; the Rimadyl caused bloody stools. The second time he was treated with Galliprant (1/2 60mg tab 1x per day) and this seemed to work well. He had very restricted rest (limited to small area of house, outside on leash only for a very short stroll only to use the bathroom) for at least 10 days each time. All of his labs were ""normal"" in August. 
   * **This weekend:** On Friday, his back was arched (like cat pose in yoga) but he was mobile, able to use the bathroom (urinate & defecate) and his appetite was normal. He was panting and shaking Saturday AM so we went to the urgent vet in our area. Prior to going to the vet, he urinated. He refused his regular food but accepted my offering of \~6oz of leftover salmon. He drank water prior to the vet visit.  The vet shared that he showed some signs of a vestibular issue (slight leaning to the left, knuckling on one of his back feet). His temperature was normal (100.8). We already had a follow-up scheduled with our regular vet first thing Monday morning, so we opted for pain management. Bailey received injections of Buprenorphine 0.09mg(0.45ml), Midazolam 3.5mg(0.7ml). He went limp noodle pretty much immediately and we stayed for an additional 45 minutes to have him monitored. His breathing and heart rate were normal. He slept most of the day and refused food. The vet shared that the Buprenorphine would likely wear off in 6-8 hours but he appeared to be very uncoordinated, sleepy, and drugged into the evening. He would drink water if I held the bowl to him. He urinated 1x before we went to bed. On Sunday morning, he was still very uncoordinated and appeared to have a very strong lean to the left. He also had facial twitching. He slept a lot but refused most food and water. I was able to get him to lick peanut butter off my finger & to drink \~1/4 cup of water. He received additional water via a turkey baster a few times because I was worried about hydration. He peed 1x mid afternoon (\~1PM)
   * **Today:** We arrived at Bailey's primary vet for an 8AM appointment. I carried him into the lobby and the client room because he was having significant difficulties walking. He veers strongly to the left, has facial and eye twitching, random bouts of panting, poor coordination, and knuckling of his feet (on one side only). Our vet agreed that this was a vestibular issue versus related to back pain. Bailey has no signs of an outer ear infection and is responsive to pain in all four limbs. Our vet shared that this could be ideopathic or it could be a sign of something happening to his brain. We talked about the pros and cons of an MRI or CT scan and decided to wait and see. Bailey was given subcutaneous fluids to help with dehydration, and a 10mg/ml injection of Cerenia for nausea. We were sent home with several cans of Royal Canine GI Low fat food, Galliprant for pain & inflammation, and advised to start Gabapentin for pain & anxiety (100mg; we had some from the August visit). We got home around 10AM. He drank lots of water and ate 3/4 of a can of food (slowly & clumsily but enthusiastically nonetheless). I gave him Galliprant but not Gabapentin (plan was to start it tonight because it has historically made his coordination worse). I have taken him out 2x to attempt to pee. Balance is hard. He seems very focused on not falling (we use a harness). He has tried to lift his leg to pee but is unable to stand upright. He does not appear to be straining or in pain. He does appear interested in peeing but he doesn't seem to be urgently seeking a spot either. Historically, he has refused to pee without lifting his leg. He continues to drink water independently and when offered. His appetite appears to have decreased again. 
* **Clinical signs:** Vestibular signs: face twitching, poor coordination, decreased appetite, strong lean towards left, some circling. Urination: Not since Sunday afternoon (it is Monday at 6PM here). 
* **Duration: last urinated Sunday afternoon (\~26 hours ago)** 
* **Your general location: Texas USA** 
* **Links to test results, vet reports, X-rays etc:** 

**My question:** I called our vet's office prior to writing this post. One of the techs suggested using an additional leash or towel to support him closer to his back legs. They told me to call back first thing in the morning if he still hasn't urinated. I am taking him to my dad's house (my dad has a very flat backyard with Bailey's preferred type of grass. Also, my dad has two dogs and Bailey likes to pee where they pee) to try again in an hour. I plan to use the second leash for support at that time. If that doesn't work, **are there any other tools or tricks to encourage urination?** 

**Tl;dr: My dog has vestibular disease and very poor coordination. He is very proud to be a boy and refuses to pee without lifting his leg. He seems interested in peeing but is not urgently seeking to go either. Any advice for getting him to go?** ",1,1728947526.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False

She engaged in chats and actually asked questions, and we organically brought up suggestions for a first date. The date went well, went with a classic wine date at my favourite bar, drink took the edge off and we were laughing after not too long.

I then went on holiday for a week and we setup a 2nd date which we had yesterday; it started as just coffee and a long walk through the city parks, which then turned into a couple pub stops and eventually dinner. We setup Wednesday as our next date, I suggested dinner and a romcom (something we bonded over early on) and she suggested my place so it's a date!

Thing is, I've sent myself into a spiral of overthinking. At first I was thinking something neither of us have seen but then that kinda means we'd both _have_ to watch the movie. So I'm trying to think of other classics and I'm spoilt for choice and want something that sets a good romantic tone.

Further context: we haven't kissed yet. I came out of a relationship around 4 months ago, so I haven't done this in over 4 years and I'm terrified of doing anything to make her uncomfortable. BUT I also don't want to go 3+ dates without anything happening or else she might think I'm not interested, and things will turn stale. I'm not banking on her staying over as I typically like to take things slow so I'm not thinking of putting any of _those_ kinds of moves, but if there's some sort of romantic tone in the air after dinner and a couple glasses of wine, it'd definitely help bridge the gap in trying to initiate affection, etc.

#‚ñåMain stories covered:

>- **[NEWS]  Figaro alters name to ‚Äúbroaden brand identity‚Äù...** **Figaro** [FCG 0.86 ‚ñ≤6.2%; 852% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=738dbe1802ac4af1abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] changed plans to change its full legal name from ‚ÄúFigaro Coffee Group, Inc.‚Äù to ‚ÄúFigaro Culinary Group, Inc.‚Äù to ‚Äúbetter reflect its strategic vision and broaden its brand identity.‚Äù FCG said that the new name will ‚Äúoutline the company‚Äôs commitment to quality and innovation as it expands its offerings to include a wide range of culinary products and experiences.‚Äù FCG also confirmed that it is seeking a strategic investor, and is considering a follow-on offering or preferred share sale in the future to fund its three-year growth plan.
>    - ***MB:*** I had myself a [Sensible Chuckle‚Ñ¢](https://tenor.com/search/sensible-chuckle-gifs) because I think that FCG has always been incorrectly named, considering the offering is all about **Angel‚Äôs Pizza**. The ‚ÄúFigaro Coffee‚Äù part of the IPO prospectus was hardly noticeable. It always seemed to me that the name was configured for name recognition of the older crowd most likely to invest in this stock. Figaro doesn‚Äôt have to remove ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù from its name to bring us non-coffee culinary experiences, it‚Äôs been doing that since before it was listed. The Liu Family is great at hype, though, so perhaps this is just one part of selling the new growth strategy to the new strategic investor that they‚Äôre hoping to attract into buying a 20% primary stake. As a former corporate lawyer, I‚Äôd just be relieved at the simplicity of the ‚Äúfind/replace‚Äù needed to make this change. It doesn‚Äôt even alter the company‚Äôs initialism!

>- **[UPDATE]  SFA Semicon shareholders approve voluntary delisting...** The shareholders of **SFA Semicon Philippines** [SSP 2.13 ‚ñº0.5%; 0% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=804a261e0f68178aabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] voted to approve the planned delisting, with at least two-thirds of the stockholders voting in favor, and no shareholders casting votes against delisting. This caused SSP to file its official petition to the PSE to delist, which it hopes will be effective December 12, 2024.
>    - ***MB:*** The tender offer by SSP‚Äôs parent company, **SFA Semicon of Korea** (SSK), will need to attract more than half of the outstanding public float to be successful. SSK owns approximately 90% of the outstanding shares, but it needs to get at least half of the remaining 10% to delist. The tender offer started yesterday, and will run through November 12. I know that there has been a long and bitter campaign by some of SSP‚Äôs shareholders to push back against the tender offer price, but I have not seen any of the complaints being picked up by other media outlets or echoed by other minority shareholders. I honestly don‚Äôt have enough background knowledge to comment, other than to acknowledge that reasonable minds appear to be able to disagree on the valuation, but that this vote indicates that it might not matter.

>- **[NEWS]  SEC wants to boost number of energy IPOs...** The **SEC** [[link](https://qa.philstar.com/business/2024/10/08/2390826/new-sec-guidelines-seen-power-energy-sector)] has said that it is planning to launch a new set of guidelines ‚Äúearly next year‚Äù to create ‚Äúsort of a fast lane where [the SEC] will prioritize registration of investments in the energy sector.‚Äù The guidelines will require the SEC to complete its review of a power company‚Äôs registration statement in less than 45 days, and will allow applicants to bypass the SEC‚Äôs 20% public float requirement to avail of a lower 15% public float minimum. The SEC thinks this will ‚Äúenable faster approvals‚Äù by ‚Äúmaking it easier to comply‚Äù.
>    - ***MB:*** Maybe I‚Äôm reading the information wrong, or maybe the information provided by the SEC is incomplete because this is only at the ‚Äúconcepts of a plan‚Äù phase, but it seems like the only things mentioned to make this ‚Äúfast lane‚Äù were for the SEC to comply with some existing timelines from other statutes and then to allow the companies to circumvent the default minimum public ownership requirement. In the re-development of the REIT Law, one of the key things was lowering the minimum public ownership level for REITs from 40% to 33.33%, but neither of these levels are below the PSE‚Äôs default (they were and are in fact well above it). I‚Äôm not sure what lowering the MPO does to increase the speed of approvals, but I could see how promising to act quickly on an application and then not requiring the company to sell as much of itself to the public could be viable inducements to get more companies to list. From an investing perspective, I think it‚Äôs always better to have more options, but from a trading perspective, I think it‚Äôs better to push public floats up to make sure there are enough shares in the public to facilitate a vibrant market of potential buyers and sellers. The SEC‚Äôs and PSE‚Äôs moves in recent years to lift the minimum public float is a step in the right direction. Let‚Äôs see what the guidelines say in FY25.

A bit about me/some general interests: 

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn‚Äôt?) - I‚Äôm definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done. I love coffee. I‚Äôm very close with my family, we spend a lot of time together. I like to stay active, and exercise daily. [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/h0HFFpQ)

A bit about the type of person I‚Äôm looking for: 
I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I‚Äôm not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I‚Äôm very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific ‚Äútype‚Äù of person! I‚Äôm looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I‚Äôm not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you‚Äôd be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - ‚Äúhey‚Äù does not start a conversation. ",0,1728946413.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

It's a physical expression of my love for and trust in my partner. And I would be very grateful for their love and trust, because to me it's also a two way street.

My own dad once told me ""sex is a selfish act"". The one and only time I ever talked back to that man. ""Then you're doing it wrong"".

Doesn't anyone get bored of robotic responses?

I used ChatGPT o1 Preview for roleplay, and the responses were so smart and well-done, like it perfectly handled SFW roleplays. But after a while, it gets boring because some of us want more than just SFW content‚Äîlike NSFW jokes or something like that.

But when I try NSFW platforms like (I don't want mention but all platforms that allow nsfw) I immediately close them. It feels like I'm talking to a dumb AI (sorry for saying that don't get angry). The responses are robotic and boring, so I go back to ChatGPT o1 Preview. When I hit my usage limit there, I switch to AI Studio from Google since they allow NSFW responses. However, even then, the NSFW content feels repetitive and bad in Gemini. I understand that ChatGPT and Gemini won't focus on NSFW content, but when it comes to SFW, they are nearly perfect.

What I want to know is if there's a possibility that in the future NSFW LLMs will be as smart as SFW ones. Because whenever I try to interact with a bot during a sexual scene, it gives stupid responses, like it's not really paying attention to what I say. For example, if I lick their neck or somewhere unusual, the bot might just say: ""Yes, more"" ""Mmm"" or something generic (you know what I mean) But when I do something unusual in SFW contexts, the responses are so much smarter and more fitting. For example, if I describe an ugly bastard entering my cafe and staring at my employees in a perverted way, and I try to kick him out, he might say: ""I'm just a customer, is it wrong to look wherever my eyes fall? Also, you have all these beautiful girls; don‚Äôt tell me you've never done something naughty with them behind the kitchen, also you know if you made those cute girls work for naughty clubs instead of serving coffees you gonna make a lot of money I'll even pay you to let me grab one of your employees' asses.""

I made the bots responses instead of me, and they were so smart they didn't like what he said

See how smart that response is in an SFW scene?

But when it comes to sex, it goes back to being like ChatGPT 3.5‚Äîjust generic and repetitive., in sex when I do something I Know they won't like it or they gonna see it as something weird in the end they are gonna like it and say more like usual 

Sorry if you don't like what I said but it's comes from someone using ai for long time, that's what I wanted to say. And for the perverted ugly bastard scene, I used 'AI Studio Google.', don't waste ur time in using it wait untill 2.0 release bcs it's bad right now ",5,1728946279.0,JanitorAI_Official,1,0.78,False
1g3t4hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1g3t4hi/im_recovering_from_ed_and_trying_to_enjoy_my_body/,"I'm recovering from ED and trying to enjoy my body, but my family keeps bullying me","edit: i forgor ed had many meanings. i mean eating disorder, in case it's not clear.  
and before anyone says ""it's not thanksgiving!"" yes, yes it is where i am. 

I'm trying to enjoy thanksgiving with my family, and all day I've been hearing comments about me being trans, eating too much, and getting fat. All day. I lost it when I mentioned I wanted to get some ice cream for dessert, and they started hounded me about how much I weigh. When I told them, they didn't believe me, and started hounding me to get on the scale.

This has been recurring for many years. my family knows about my troubles with food. I dropped all the way down to 90lbs in high school. I was 130lbs in college, and after dating my boyfriend I spiked to 150. I am very stressed about it. but I'm trying not to worry about the number. I've been working out, getting at least 5km in minimum three days a week, and before I caught covid, I was working out every morning. I've been trying to eat at least two things a day, and not trying to count calories. I try to eat healthy. I'm chronically low in all my vitamins, so I've been trying to eat more real food. But, somedays I'm lucky if I eat anything in a day. I'm sorry for snacking on thanksgiving, and im sorry for trying not to worry about what I eat, and I'm sorry I can't control my weight

I yelled at them to fuck off and never bring it up again, and now they're talking about how im too sensitive and they can't joke with me. I'm miserable. it's triggered a full panic attack. I'm many hours from home and there's no busses. I want them to never bring it up again but they keep bringing it up, as if they're purposely trying to bring me back to nothing but a banana and cup of coffee a day again. I'm not happy about my weight. im not happy about my body. but i'm trying my hardest to be okay with it and focus on being healthy and rather the number. but they're making it so hard,

  
im so fucking upset. it's not even like i ate a lot today, too. I ate two cinnamon buns for breakfast since that's what was made for everyone, i had one fucking pizza pop and one singular chicken wing for lunch since they were made for me (i didn't even ask!) and i had some beef jerky and a bag of chips that i've been fucking grazing on for the past two days. it's not my house so i can't fucking choose healthier; they're the ones making sugary treats for breakfast. like jeez im sorry grazing on one tiny ass bag of chips over the course of two days is so fucking wrong of me! I didn't know one pizza pop and one wing and two mini cinnamon rolls and a handful of chips are worthwhile fatshaming! on a holiday about food!
