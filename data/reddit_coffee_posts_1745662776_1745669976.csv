1k8bmia,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1k8bmia/unexpected_coffee_shop_date/,Unexpected coffee shop date,"Hi all,

I’ve been feeling a bit down lately about the whole dating thing, however the other day something silly and sweet happened that cheered me right up!

I was downstairs from my office taking a quick coffee break. While waiting in line, I found myself standing behind a nice looking, tall, grey-haired man.  

After paying, I moved to the pick-up area and was lost in thought and didn’t realise I was about to end up smack in the middle of a group of young guys taking a selfie! I only noticed when I caught the same man smiling at me. That’s when I looked around, ( because i wasn't sure he was smiling at me,  lol ) realised what was happening, and practically jumped sideways to get out of their photo.  

He started laughing, and I asked in mock outrage why he didn’t warn me. He just shrugged and said, “Well, maybe they wanted you in their photo?” (for the record, the young guys were completely oblivious to me 🙄).  

When our drinks were ready, he asked if I wanted to get a table with him and I said yes, and we had a lovely chat ( I ended up being late for a meeting 😁).  

Next week we’re planning to grab lunch. I’m really looking forward to it!

TL;DR:
Had an unexpected coffee shop encounter with a sweet man after a funny moment involving a group of young guys taking a selfie. We got along so well that we've planned a lunch date. 

Anyone else have any meet-cute stories to share?",1,1745669882.0,datingoverfifty,0,1.0,False

Since going to uni I've been lonely. It's had a really bad toll on my mental health and I wish I had been more proactive about it earlier. But I'm trying to work myself to be better so I'm here to make friends. I'm open to have a conversation with anyone on here but I am also looking for someone near me to meet up with for a coffee someday soon. 

I have always got on with girls better, maybe it's because I'm quite feminine or maybe it's because I was brought up in an all girl household and that forced me to have a different perspective of female friends. 

I'm a guy but I'm unsure about my gender identity. For now use whatever you like. 

My interests include the last of us, gaming, cooking, reading, coffee, walking, hiking, camping. Many more could be included as I'm happy to talk about anything and am happy to learn anything for the benefit of a friend. ",1,1745669824.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of custom styrofoam cups depends on several factors, including the material used, the printing process, and the available customization options.

**Material Density:** The density of the styrofoam significantly impacts its insulation properties and durability.

A higher density styrofoam provides better insulation, keeping hot beverages hotter for longer and cold beverages colder. It also makes the cup more resistant to crushing and damage during handling. Look for cups made with a density of at least 1.2 lbs per cubic foot for optimal performance. This ensures that the cup maintains its shape and integrity, even with repeated use or accidental bumps. Higher density foam also translates to a more premium feel, enhancing the overall user experience.

**Printing Technology:** The printing technology used determines the clarity, durability, and color accuracy of the custom design.

Modern printing methods like digital printing and heat transfer allow for intricate designs and vibrant colors that won't easily fade or peel. Traditional screen printing is also a viable option for simpler designs and larger orders. Ensure the printer uses food-safe inks that are resistant to smudging or bleeding when exposed to moisture or heat. The printing should also be precise, with sharp lines and accurate color reproduction. A high-quality print enhances the overall aesthetic appeal of the cup and reinforces brand recognition.

**Customization Options:** The range of customization options available allows for creating unique and personalized cups.

Look for providers that offer a variety of cup sizes, colors, and lid styles. The ability to upload custom artwork, logos, and text is essential. Some providers also offer additional customization options, such as embossed designs or textured finishes. Consider the printing area available on the cup to ensure your design fits appropriately. The more customization options available, the greater the opportunity to create a cup that perfectly reflects your brand or personal style.

**Lid Compatibility:** A secure and well-fitting lid is crucial for preventing spills and maintaining beverage temperature.

Ensure that the cups are compatible with tight-fitting lids that won't easily pop off. Look for lids with features like sip openings or straw slots for added convenience. The lids should be made from durable materials that can withstand repeated use. Some providers offer insulated lids that provide additional temperature control. A well-designed lid is an essential component of a functional and user-friendly custom styrofoam cup.

**Environmental Considerations:** While styrofoam is not the most eco-friendly material, some manufacturers are taking steps to reduce their environmental impact.

Look for cups made with recycled content or that are recyclable in certain areas. Some providers also offer alternative materials, such as paper or compostable cups, as a more sustainable option. Consider the end-of-life impact of the cups and choose options that align with your environmental values. While styrofoam has its drawbacks, responsible manufacturing practices can help minimize its environmental footprint.

 ## Core Benefits

Custom styrofoam cups offer a range of benefits for businesses and individuals alike.

**Brand Promotion:** Custom-printed cups serve as a mobile billboard, increasing brand awareness and recognition.

Every time someone uses a custom styrofoam cup with your logo or design, they are exposing your brand to others. This provides a cost-effective way to promote your business or event. A well-designed cup can also create a positive brand impression, enhancing your company's image. The cups can be distributed at events, conferences, or in-house, maximizing their promotional impact.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** Styrofoam cups are generally more affordable than other types of custom cups, such as ceramic or stainless steel.

This makes them an attractive option for businesses on a budget or for large-scale events. The lower cost per unit allows for ordering larger quantities without breaking the bank. Styrofoam cups are also lightweight and easy to transport, further reducing costs. The affordability of styrofoam cups makes them a practical choice for various applications.

**Insulation Properties:** Styrofoam provides excellent insulation, keeping hot beverages hot and cold beverages cold.

This makes them ideal for serving coffee, tea, soda, or other beverages. The insulation also helps to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the cup, keeping hands dry and comfortable. The ability to maintain beverage temperature enhances the overall drinking experience. Whether you're serving hot cocoa in the winter or iced tea in the summer, styrofoam cups provide superior insulation.

**Customization Versatility:** The ability to fully customize the cup's design allows for creating unique and eye-catching products.

From simple logos to complex artwork, styrofoam cups can be printed with a wide range of designs. This allows for creating cups that perfectly reflect your brand or personal style. The customization options also allow for adding personalized messages or event details. The versatility of custom styrofoam cups makes them suitable for various occasions.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about custom styrofoam cups.

**What is the minimum order quantity for custom styrofoam cups?**
The minimum order quantity varies depending on the provider and the complexity of the design. Some providers offer low minimums for small businesses or individuals, while others require larger orders. Generally, you can expect minimums to range from 50 to 500 cups. Inquiring directly with the provider will give you the most accurate information based on your specific requirements.

**What file formats are accepted for custom artwork?**
Most providers accept vector-based file formats such as AI, EPS, or PDF. These formats allow for scaling the artwork without losing quality. High-resolution raster images such as JPEG or PNG may also be accepted, but it's essential to ensure the resolution is high enough to prevent pixelation. Always check with the provider for their specific file format requirements before submitting your artwork.

**How long does it take to receive my custom styrofoam cups after placing an order?**
Production time varies depending on the provider, the complexity of the design, and the order quantity. Typically, you can expect production to take anywhere from 5 to 15 business days. Shipping time will add additional days to the delivery timeframe. It's crucial to factor in production and shipping time when placing your order, especially if you need the cups by a specific date.

**Are custom styrofoam cups recyclable?**
Styrofoam is generally not recyclable in most municipal recycling programs. However, some specialized recycling facilities do accept styrofoam. Check with your local recycling program to see if styrofoam is accepted in your area. If not, consider alternative materials such as paper or compostable cups for a more sustainable option.

And sure, their flat white is heavenly, smooth, rich, and probably brewed with unicorn tears. But let’s be honest: it’s not the coffee that keeps me coming back like a caffeine-addicted boomerang. It’s her.

Now, a little about me: I’m shy. Like, Olympic-level shy. The kind of shy where mild social anxiety is my trusty sidekick, especially when it comes to talking to pretty girls.

But despite my natural talent for panicking over nothing, I try. Every visit, I muster my inner strength and attempt small talk. Usually, it goes something like:
Me: “Nice weather today!”
Her: “Yep!”
Me: “….” (panics internally as the queue of coffee-starved humans behind me grows to an angry mob)

So there’s this girl. Let’s call her the calm barista queen. She’s been working there for about five months now. She’s the embodiment of “serene.” Pretty, grounded, and somehow able to remain chill while steamers hiss, grinders roar, and impatient customers hover like caffeinated vultures.

The big problem?
Well, her workplace isn’t exactly prime romance real estate. She’s always in the presence of her co-workers and around people who just want their fix of espresso, not a live rom-com episode. Which leaves me in a bit of a pickle:

How do you ask someone out for coffee… when they’re literally making your coffee?

It feels like proposing a plot twist mid-transaction:
“Hi, can I get a flat white, and also, would you like to drink a flat white with me sometime?”

Yeah. Not exactly smooth.

Old skilling will remain dead until you give us a better use for these items. It doesn't have to be a pure item>gp sink (that's just the GE with extra steps)  but give us some creative measures.

I was at a colleagues house having a BBQ and all day drinking session last Friday. I was actually taking it pretty chill, not drinking quick, wanting to just enjoy myself and not get too drunk. I was definitely intoxicated at the time of the incident, but my colleagues described me as being alright, lucid and not overly drunk at the time. My colleague has a large plot of land that has a BBQ/Cabin/Hot tub area out of the back of the house. 

The night was winding down and we were just in the cabin, having a chat with the few that were left that were staying over that night. I left them in the cabin to go behind it for a wee. It was at this time I had a fall, around 2am Saturday morning. I suffered a pretty serious cut to my head and I have no idea if I lost consciousness or not. I just remember trying to make myself get up, literally telling myself ""Get up, you've got to get up"". I must have lost my balance on the uneven ground. I suspect that my head may have contacted a fence post, or something similar. 

I got up and went back into the main house and attended to my wound. This is evidenced via the CCTV attached to the back of the house. It was not in range to trigger to know exactly at what point I went around the back of the cabin. My colleagues just presumed I had taken myself to bed at this point and didn't think much of it. I believe I spent some time dealing with the blood and potentially think I was sick, as there was evidence of both on my shoes the next day. I then seemingly put my hoodie up as a blood soaker-upper and feel asleep on their sofa.

I was awoken the next day by my colleague and his wife with obvious concern for me as she had seen blood around the house and must have seen the blood on my hoodie. I felt relatively ok, a little hungover and surprised by the fuss. They stressed that I needed to do something about the cut even if I felt fine otherwise. I went to the toilet and looked in the mirror and realised how right they were. Whilst it wasn't running with blood at this point, it was still bleeding. This was around 8 hours later. So I had a coffee, a sausage sandwich and woke myself up. They tended to the wound, cleaned it up and put a dressing on it. About midday, still feeling pretty normal, I took myself to the minor injuries clinic close by. 

After a bit of a wait, I was seen by Triage Nurse, who asked loads of questions about the incident, none of which I could answer. A lot of the information regarding the timeline and the CCTV only came about days later. She said that I needed to go to A&E as there were too many unknowns about the severity of the head injury and that it was perhaps even too late to close the wound up. In reality at this time, I was only thinking about closing the wound up as I didn't want to keep on bleeding everywhere.

Now, here is where it gets a bit silly. I don't live near where I work. The location of the BBQ was near work, some two hours away from where I live. So I made the insane (in hindsight) decision to drive to the A&E close to where I live. I drove there, with music blaring, no real cognitive issues etc. My car has adaptive cruise control so a lot of the decision making was done by the car and the journey is mostly cruising motorway type roads/speeds. Just FYI, I have subsequently done a blood/alcohol level estimator tool online and found that my blood/alcohol level at this point, based on the drinks that I consumed the day before, would have been below the legal limit.

I get to A&E, book myself in and can't remember my phone number. Even though I have had it for close to 20 years and can recite at ease normally. Again, I get seen by a triage nurse, this time with added ECGs, blood pressure checks, continuous observation etc. But it is a looooong wait. I am obviously the lowest of the low priorities. It's Easter weekend and I have a self inflicted head wound that could have been avoided. I am sat in the waiting room; bored, hungry, tired, hungover, falling asleep a little as I sit. I look at my phone and see I had a phone call at around midday from one of my colleagues, he had left early the night before. I saw that I had answered, and that we spoke for over 2 minutes. I had no recollection of that at all. At this point, with the lack of memory of this call, and my inability to recite my mobile number, I knew that all was not quite right.

So I get seen by a clinician, who wasn't very talkative. He put 14 staples in my head and we go for a CT scan. I bleed over the machine but the main thing is that it's all clear, I get the wound dressed and leave. I don't think about asking any further questions, such as ""Am I concussed?"", ""Am I ok to drive?"", ""When do I get the staples out?"" ""What should I do next in terms of recovery?"". None of that, I am tired, hungry, bored and have been in A&E for 7 hours at this point. So I go back to my car which is parked in an adjacent supermarket car park. I pop in to the shop to get some food. I buy a bag at the self-checkout and place it on the basket side and wonder why the machine wont let me proceed with the checking out. I was utterly befuddled and the assistant comes over with a strange look on her face as she moves the bag over to the bagging side. I return home, eat and go to sleep.

I sleep for 9 hours solid, maybe more. I make excuses for not going to my sisters for an Easter family lunch and tell her why. I go back to sleep. I awake and my sister says she's going to bring over a roast dinner. I ask her not to and to leave me alone. She ignores that and brings my mum over too. I lose my shit at this, I ranted at them as they walk towards my door and hand me the plate. We have a brief chat and they leave satisfied that I am not all that bad. I have another nap before watching some more TV and going to bed.

The next day is much the same, eating, sleeping, watching TV and feeling pretty crappy. Pressure in the skull, fogginess, fatigue, can't concentrate, can't make decisions, generally slow, confused.

I wake up on the Tuesday and feel just as bad, and now with the Easter Holiday weekend over, I decide to ring 111 to ask 1) What should I do with the dressing, it's been a couple of days, do I just have a go at it myself? 2) Should I go back to work tomorrow? (another 2 hours drive required first). The Nurse on 111 suggests going back to the same hospital but the urgent care ward instead and have them take care of everything and give me the advise I should have taken before I left A&E on Saturday.

So I go back, they do some more concussion testing, nervous system checks and look at the wound. Everything seems ok and we decide to not redress it. They advise that I shouldn't return to work or drive until ""I feel normal"". Again, at no point do I get told that I have concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury or anything. I get an info sheet saying how to recover from a head injury that mentions limiting screen time which is something I didn't think about. All I had been doing since Sunday AM, whilst awake, is watch TV or look at my phone as I limited my physical exertion. 

So time passes, II sleep a lot, I feel the fog lift but it gets replaced by a light sensitivity that brings headaches and other discomfort. I limit my screen time, listen to music, take walks, cook healthy food, play a bit of guitar etc. I generally start to feel better apart from the light sensitivity. On Thursday I feel pretty good, I start to think about whether I should be going back to work. My shift should have been Wednesday - Sunday, 7am - 7pm. So I use my access to Bupa and their online GP service, where I get told that I clearly need more time to recover and get signed off for a week and for it to be reviewed at it's conclusion. She seems bemused that I am even trying with there still being apparent symptoms. Fair enough.

  
If you got this far, thanks. I appreciate it. I still haven't been told that I was definitely concussed, but with the size of the cut/impact and with all the symptoms noted above i.e. Possible loss of consciousness and probable vomiting, memory loss, fatigue, confusion, headaches, light sensitivity, irritability, concentration issues, fogginess, decision making and cognitive processing problems etc. I don't doubt that I suffered a concussion.

My questions are; 

1. Why was it so less apparent initially? I may have blacked out, I may have vomited and I was certainly in pain at the time of impact. Yet, in the morning, I was pretty ok. I felt pretty ok. I drove for 2 hours fine. If it wasn't for the mental lapses, I wouldn't have suspected a thing. I've had worse hangovers and in fact, I wouldn't even say I felt that hungover. Nothing a bit of rehydration couldn't fix.

2. Did the driving and the screen time worsen the symptoms and slow the recovery?

3. Is this timeline weird? Mental/cognitive issues apparent before any pain or pain inducing symptoms? 

4. Why did no-one tell me I had concussion? Is it not that definitive? Was it a lapse on their part? Did they just think that I knew that already? Is it not the norm to inform the patient? Or perhaps, did I miss it in my mental fog? I don't believe so but I guess I can't rule it out.

\----

I'm using a hosted Nextcloud (Hetzner 5TB storage share) and migrating from Onedrive and GoogleDrive there. I have disabled ""AI tagging"" in Onedrive and never tried it I think, maybe years ago and the results were mediocre.  
I cannot find a toggle in google photos.. but the search does find pictures based on words (annoyingly it forces me to use german words, english does not work..), the results are quite accurate, but I've no idea if they are remotely complete?

The default nextcloud photos app is completely UNUSABLE for various reasons, but ""memories"" is quite nice, but not without its issues. I was baffled to realize it has no plain search function (it cannot search for filenames? really? how is that possible..), but needs ""Recognize"" to work at all, so I installed that.

I have no shell access on the server but was able to trigger the download of the language models. First I wasn't sure if it'll work but sure enough it started tagging. I only enabled ""Object recognition"" for now.

The result is hilariously bad, it's amazing. It's not even 50% accurate for most tags, some are easy and correct, some are so far off I don't even. I'll link a few examples below.

The question is: Why would you use that?

* If it is not > 98% accurate, you can't rely on this feature to find something you look for in your library, but have to tag your pictures manually?
* If tags are wrong, it just costs you time to delete the false tags?
* Is this a result of limited computing resources? The model size for object recognition is only 1GB according to github, which sounds really really small nowadays.

Use it just for the LOLs? IMO in the present state this is just a waste of electricity.

                               **The blind justice**




Morning light streamed through the curtains of Judge Evelyn Carter's apartment, spilling across the polished hardwood floor in long, golden beams. The soft hum of the city outside, the chirping of birds, and the distant murmur of passing cars blended into a kind of ambient soundtrack. But Evelyn hardly noticed. The world outside her apartment felt far away, as if it was happening to someone else.

Her coffee sat untouched on the table, growing cold with each passing minute as she skimmed the case file for the hundredth time.

State vs. Marcus Hale.

A robbery turned violent. A store clerk, beaten so badly they had been placed in a medically-induced coma. A suspect-Marcus Hale-identified by the CCTV footage, eyewitness testimony, and his fingerprints found at the scene.

An open-and-shut case. Or so it seemed.

And yet, there was something. Something that didn't sit right. Something that gnawed at the back of her mind like a shadow just out of reach, refusing to reveal itself.

The law-she had been a servant to it for years. It was the pillar of truth, or so they said. It was meant to be a beacon, shining through the murk of human frailty and bringing order to chaos.

But Evelyn knew better.

Law was not the truth. It was a machine. Unfeeling. Efficient. Systematic. And above all else-flawed. It chewed up the innocent just as easily as it chewed up the guilty. It didn't care for the little details that fell through the cracks. It didn't care for the whispers of doubt that rose like smoke from beneath the surface. It didn't care about the human cost of the words it spoke. It simply was-a force as cold and mechanical as the gavel in her hand.

Evidence built a narrative. But that narrative could be false.

She had seen it before. Countless times. The system's precision was its greatest flaw. Proof was laid out in black-and-white; facts were presented. But in the silence of the courtroom, the faces of the accused were not numbers-they were people. People with lives that had been reduced to pieces of evidence.

How many times had she seen the innocent condemned because the proof was stacked against them? How many times had she heard the name of a person she would never know, reduced to a fingerprint on a door, a footprint in the dirt, a shaky eyewitness testimony? How many had been locked away in the depths of the prison system while the true criminals-those with enough wealth, enough connections-walked free, laughing behind closed doors because they knew how to play the game?

Her fingers tightened around the file, the edges crinkling slightly under her grip. I'm not one of them. She wanted to tell herself that. To believe it.

But the law-she thought as her gaze lingered on the crisp page-does not care for doubt without basis. The law had no room for emotion. No room for heart. And today, she would be asked to do what she had done for years: decide.

Her heart thundered against her chest, and for a moment, it almost felt as if the weight of the robe she wore had tripled, suffocating her, pulling her down.

~~~~

Evelyn had seen Marcus Hale once before-when he was first brought in, shackled and silent. He was young, barely in his twenties, and yet there was something in his eyes that had caught her attention.

It wasn't fear.

It wasn't defiance.

It was something much darker. Something that sent a chill down her spine. It was the look of a man who had already been judged before he had even spoken. His eyes -dark and haunted-held the resignation of someone twice his age, as if he had already come to terms with the fact that life was a cruel game of fate. His posture was hunched, as if the weight of the world had been placed on his shoulders long ago.

What had brought him here? What had shaped him into someone who could look at the world with such a heavy, unseeing gaze?

And yet, here he was his fate now in her hands.

Was she about to do the same to him?

Was she about to pass her own judgement, to take his life and imprison it behind bars, never once asking why?

To simply obey the law-cold, unfeeling, efficient.

Her pulse quickened. She glanced back at the file, then at the untouched coffee cup beside her. Her fingers drummed absently on the table.

She thought about her father's voice, the way it had echoed in her mind every time she struggled with doubt.

The law is not about you, he had told her, so many years ago. It is not about the heart. It is not about emotions. It is about what is just, what is fair. The law is a machine-and if you cannot serve the machine, then you will be crushed beneath it.

The old man's voice would not leave her. *You'll be crushed.*

Had she become the thing she feared? Had she grown to wield the machine like a weapon, indifferent to the faces of those it cut down?

Her fingers curled around the file tighter, a deep breath escaping her lips as she stared out the window. The city below continued to hum, unaware of the gravity of what was about to transpire. She could feel the weight of everything in her bones-the truth she could not see clearly, the law that demanded an answer.

But what if the law was wrong? What if everything in her gut screamed that something about Marcus Hale's guilt didn't fit the story they were telling?

Evelyn stood up suddenly, the chair scraping back sharply against the floor. She walked to the window, the city sprawling beneath her.

The room was still.

*What is justice?* she wondered silently. Was it the law?

The unyielding certainty that followed a system of rules and order, one that could not afford to stray into the grey? Was that what justice was?

Or was justice something deeper, something more human? Something that didn't just see facts, but saw lives-saw souls? Was justice about knowing when the law had failed and when mercy had to take its place?

The alarm chimed, a soft, insistent sound, snapping her out of her reverie. It was time.

With a quiet sigh, Evelyn turned away from the window.

The world didn't wait for troubled hearts.

And yet, as she walked toward the door, she couldn't help but feel the crushing weight of her role. Her purpose. Her decision.

She had to decide. **What would *she* believe?**

The courtroom awaited her. And with it, the weight of the law. But it was hers to carry.

Her fingers curled around the door handle, and with one last breath, she stepped into the world that had been built to break hearts like hers.

<<Pov shift>>

Marcus Hale sat in a cell that smelled of sweat and despair. The walls, dull and chipped, seemed to close in on him. The faint hum of the fluorescent light overhead was the only sound that accompanied his every breath. The cold metal of the steel cuffs bit into his wrists, a constant reminder of his confinement. His fingers, bound and trembling, rested on his lap, unable to escape the weight of the moment.

I didn't do it.

He had said it aloud. To the officers. To the prosecutor.

To his own reflection in the grimy mirror of the holding cell.

He had screamed it, whispered it, pleaded it. But it never mattered. No one had listened.

The cops hadn't cared. They had their suspect, and that was all that mattered.

The jury? They wouldn't listen either. They had seen the evidence. And that was all they needed.

In the courtroom, truth was nothing but a fleeting notion. The law didn't care about truth-it cared about proof. And the proof?

The proof had been stacked against him from the start.

He had never been inside that convenience store the night of the crime.

He had never stolen anything. He had never hurt anyone.

But the evidence-it didn't care about what he had or hadn't done.

The fingerprints-his fingerprints-found on the glass door, had been left days before. He had only stopped by the store to grab a soda. One time. He wasn't even paying attention when he touched the door. He had no idea that his fingerprints would end up there. That's how fingerprints worked. They lingered, even after the body moved on.

And the security footage?

It was grainy, unclear, barely showing the person's face. A blur. A silhouette in a hoodie.

But that was enough.

It could be me.

The prosecution, the jury-they saw what they wanted to see. They didn't see him. They saw the hoodie. The dark skin. The body shape. They saw enough to fill in the blanks.

And that was the worst part.

But the worst part wasn't the footage. The worst part wasn't even the fingerprints.

The worst part was the witness.

She was a woman. Middle-aged. Nervous. She'd been the clerk at the store. She had been there when it happened.

When the robbery went down. When the man had shoved her to the ground. The way she looked up in terror as he grabbed the money, the way her voice cracked as she tried to describe him to the police.

But her description?

It didn't fit.

Marcus had never been in that store, not that night. He had never harmed anyone. But she had been under pressure. The cops had needed answers. She had been shown his photo, and something in her gut told her it was him.

A man in a hoodie.

And that was enough.

That was always enough.

Her shaky voice had rattled out his name. Marcus Hale.

The one they had all been looking for.

But Marcus hadn't done it.

He hadn't done anything wrong.

And still, here he was.

*I am not a criminal.*

The words felt hollow now. They had lost their meaning.

How many times had he whispered them to himself in the silence of this cell? How many times had he said them out loud, hoping someone would hear?

But no one listened. No one cared.

He could see it in their eyes. The cops who had arrested him. The detectives who had questioned him. The judge who would soon decide his fate..

They all saw him as guilty.

And how could they not? He was the one they had arrested. He was the one the evidence pointed to.

His heart thudded painfully in his chest. A dull ache that wouldn't go away. He had to face it.

No one would believe him.

Not now. Not in this courtroom. Not in this world where truth and justice were secondary to what could be proven.

He was going to stand there today, in front of the judge. And the jury.

And they would see him.

They wouldn't see Marcus Hale, the innocent man who had been at the wrong place at the wrong time.

They would see a criminal.

A man who had committed a crime.

He closed his eyes.

The darkness behind his eyelids was comforting. It was the only place where the world didn't feel so heavy. The only place where he didn't feel the suffocating weight of accusation, of judgment.

But even in the darkness, he could still hear it. The whispers of the guards. The distant clang of metal doors. The echo of footsteps.

*I didn't do it.*

He said it to himself again. It was all he had left. The words were thin, fragile now. Not a cry for help, but a plea for mercy.

He was innocent.

But no one was going to believe him.

°°°°°°°

The air in the courtroom was thick, pressing down on the shoulders of every person in the room. It was the kind of tension that made every breath feel heavier, every thought sluggish and uncertain. The low murmur of the audience was nothing but a hum in the background.

Judge Evelyn Carter sat at her bench, her expression unreadable, her eyes fixed ahead as she scanned the case file in front of her. Her fingers were steepled together, but every so often, her hand would lift slightly, and her fingers would press lightly against her temple-a subtle sign of unease. She had seen countless cases, but this one, it gnawed at her.

The prosecution rose first, speaking with an unwavering confidence that carried with it a sense of finality.

""The defendant's fingerprints were found on the store's entrance. Surveillance footage places him at the scene. A witness saw a man of the defendant's height and build fleeing immediately after the attack.""

He paused, letting the words settle in the air like dust, heavy and suffocating. The prosecutor was tall, with a neatly pressed suit and eyes that glinted with the sharpness of someone who knew they had the upper hand.

Evelyn didn't react. She kept her face neutral. Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly as she listened, but she said nothing. Her fingers, however, pressed lightly against her temple. A subtle but telling sign that something was wrong, that something about the evidence was unsettling her.

The defense attorney stood up. He was younger, his suit slightly too big for his frame, his tie knotted a little too loosely. He was passionate, eager to prove his client's innocence, but there was a sense of drowning in his words. He was fighting against a tide of evidence that seemed insurmountable.

""The prosecution's case is circumstantial at best. My client's fingerprints on the door? He visited the store days prior, well before the crime occurred. The footage? Blurry, indistinct. It's impossible to make out any definitive features. And the witness? Their statement hinges on racial bias.""

The courtroom was still. The defense had made his point, but it had barely landed. The prosecutor scoffed, shaking his head with a chuckle. ""Speculation,"" he spat, his voice dripping with disdain.

The defense attorney didn't falter. ""It's reasonable doubt,"" he retorted quickly, trying to keep his voice steady. ""The entire case is built on assumptions and circumstantial evidence. The burden of proof doesn't rest on my client to prove his innocence, but on you to prove his guilt. And right now, the only thing you've proven is that he was in the store days prior. That doesn't make him a criminal.""

The prosecutor's smile widened, though it wasn't a friendly smile. It was the smile of someone who knew they were about to win. He straightened his shoulders and leaned forward. ""Doubt doesn't erase facts,"" he said, each word carefully measured, designed to land with maximum impact. ""You can spin this however you like, but the facts are clear: fingerprints. Footage. Witness testimony.""

The defense attorney shook his head, his hands trembling slightly as he motioned to Marcus, sitting quietly in the defendant's seat. ""This man's life is on the line. And you want to boil it down to some fingerprints? Some blurry footage? Is that justice? Is that what we call evidence?""

""It's more than enough to convict,"" the prosecutor interjected, his voice cutting through the defense's words like a knife. He pointed toward Marcus, who sat motionless, his hands shackled, his expression a mixture of exhaustion and fear. ""You'd like to claim there's doubt, but that's all it is-doubt. And doubt doesn't hold up in a courtroom. We deal in facts here, not speculation.""

The defense attorney took a deep breath, his hand shaking as he reached for his notes. ""It's not just doubt,"" he said, his voice quieter now, but no less firm. ""It's reasonable doubt. And under the law, that's enough. The law doesn't just convict on the convenience of a few pieces of circumstantial evidence. It demands truth. And the truth is... there's nothing that links my client to this crime beyond a coincidence.""

The prosecutor's voice was low now, his eyes never leaving the defense attorney. ""Is that what you call it, a coincidence? A man's fingerprints, a grainy video, and a witness who identified him with no hesitation? A coincidence?""

""Yes,"" the defense shot back, ""a coincidence. The witness was wrong, and I can't blame them. But the law doesn't convict based on a mistaken belief. We don't punish people for the color of their skin or the clothes they wear. We punish based on the truth, not assumptions.""

The prosecutor stood taller, his eyes flashing with cold fire. ""You're making this about race now? Is that what you're going to use to get him off the hook? Are you going to play the race card when your case is failing?""

The defense attorney's face flushed with anger. ""I'm not playing any cards. I'm saying that we have a system, a system that is supposed to be about fairness. A system that should give every man a fair trial. And that system is telling me that this man is innocent.""

In the back, Marcus sat silently. He had barely moved through the entire trial. His eyes were fixed on the floor, his jaw clenched. He had heard it all. The accusations. The facts. The speculation. But he had never felt further from the truth. The court was a whirlwind, and he was caught in the eye of it, powerless.

His attorney's words reached him, but they seemed muffled, distant. His thoughts were spinning, each one an echo. *I didn't do it.*

It was like a mantra, but it wasn't enough. Not here. Not in this room.

The defense attorney pressed on. ""This man, my client, has been wronged. This is a case built on *suspicion*-not evidence. No weapon. No clear connection. No motive.""

""No *motive*?"" the prosecutor cut in sharply. ""The motive is clear! Robbery! Violence! You want to claim there's no motive, but the truth is simple: he was at the scene. He fled. His fingerprints are all over it. We can't ignore the facts.""

The defense raised his hand in protest. ""We *can* ignore the facts when those facts are misleading and incomplete. We can't let fear and racial bias dictate what happens in this courtroom. If we do, we are failing the very principles that our justice system is supposed to protect.""

It was the prosecutor's turn to raise his voice. ""This is not a time for philosophical musings. This is a trial. We have the evidence. We have the testimony. We have the law on our side. Your client's fate is sealed.""

The defense's voice was low but firm. ""You speak of the law, but what about justice? What about the truth?""

The prosecutor's face twisted into something cold and calculating. ""What is truth if it can't be proven?"" he asked, his voice dripping with contempt.

The defense's voice shook with frustration. ""What is justice, if it can't see the difference between a criminal and an innocent man?""

Evelyn sat at her bench, watching the debate unfold. Her fingers were still pressed lightly against her temple, but the tension in the room was almost unbearable. Every word, every argument weighed on her shoulders. She had to decide. She had to make a call.

What was justice if not truth? But what if the truth was obscured? What if the law-designed to bring justice-was as blind as the scales of Lady Justice herself?

Her fingers curled into her palm, the weight of the gavel in her hand feeling like a weight on her chest.

It was time.

**""Guilty.""**

The word echoed, final and absolute.

Marcus exhaled shakily.

The prosecutor nodded. The defense clenched his jaw.

Judge Carter... didn't move.

As they led Marcus away, she looked at him.

And for the first time he saw something in her eyes.

Regret.

But regret did not rewrite reality.

*And justice had never been about fairness.*

But then, out of the blue, my partner decided to surprise me. Even though he was busy with his own work stuff, he took the time to swing by my favorite coffee shop and brought me my usual, a good ol' cup of joy. He handed it over with a little note that just said, ""You got this, babe. 💪""

Honestly, it was a small gesture, but it meant the world to me. That act of service, knowing he cared enough to make my morning a bit brighter, was everything.

1k8b6o3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k8b6o3,HELP! territorial older female Roomate with cultural and language barriers.,"
Hi all. I need help. I am a 23f living in a completely Chinese household. I moved in a few months ago and at first things were great. House smelled good at least twice a day. Roomates were quiet and kept to themselves. Things were really great. 
    But then things started to turn sour when it comes to one of the only other women in the house (probably 40-50). There is one more but she’s only here every other weekend. 
   It started off small with the community shoe rack. I had gotten a pair of spring heels that I had placed on one of the mini open spots on this shoe rack. My shoes ended up on the stairs leading to my room the next day. I figured I put my shoes in somebody’s spot so I just put them in a different open spot on the shoe rack. back on the stairs the next day. And now all of the spots are filled with women’s shoes. That’s fine I can grab my own shoe rack. I needed my coats out of my room anyway.
   I will throw in everyone and then when I would either come home around the same time as her, see her in the house, grab food or whatever she would stand in the kitchen yelling in mandarin. I’ve never translated it as it took me a while to realize she only started yelling if she saw me/ or I made a noise like walking through my room that’s above the kitchen.
   A few days ago I was cooking dinner. Goulash and prepping a pot roast for the next day. It was actually Easter Day. While I’m about finished with my goulash and about to put together the pot roast she comes out of the kitchen. (Next paragraph I describe the L shaped layout on the kitchen) she comes out of her room and stands in the center on where I’m cooking, between the stove and where I dry my dishes, and starts fucking cutting vegetables. Before this she came out and just looked at me for a second. Then went back into her room. Came back out in a towel and again stared at me. Then paced from the downstairs bathroom through the kitchen back to her room just in loops. And then of course she started to yell in mandarin. She goes to the bathroom and stands in her towel yelling while peeking around the corner at me. And then came and started chopping vegetables next to me. Basically naked. So weird. I’ve lived here 7 weeks and have never heard or seen her cook. Okay. Maybe I have a stick up my ass and it’s a coincidence? 
   And then it was the dishes. As pictured I leave my dishes to dry on the countertop on a towel. The cupboard above, below, and at top and bottom right sides are all mine. Sink is to my right also. I won’t add them all but there are several other appliances or stacks of dishes that are permanent spots in the kitchen as you can see directly behind my dishes there is a pile that’s not mine. 
   The other day I receive a message with a picture of my dishes to a group chat of the Roomates and landlord of someone complaining about my dishes being out to dry. A few times already my dishes had been moved to the other side of the kitchen. I let it go and just continued to dry them where I do. The complaint was that my dishes alone are taking over the kitchen. I then pointed out to the landlord that everyone else has dishes, and it’s only one person complaining about and touching mine. So the landlords solution is nothing on the counters. Nobody is happy but so be it. She even came over to talk to a few of us. 
   The very next day is picture number two. Guess whose dishes those are along with an appliance out of frame. I’m petty so I send a picture and reminder of the new rule to the group chat. If it’s gotta be upheld for me it should be upheld for the one who put it in place right? Anyway the landlord starts to ask who’s they are. Nobody says anything. She now says if you don’t want to abide by the rules you can move out. Here comes the kitchen banshee saying she forgot to put them away. 
   And then this morning. I wake up at probably 5 am due to the neighborhood roosters and some horrific cramps. At 6:30 I decide to make bacon and eggs. I know one Roomate starts to make coffee at around 7:30 so I try to be as quiet as possible. I’m finished up and rinsing off my dishes as my best friend the Banshee comes into the kitchen. She tells me to turn on the fan when I’m cooking. I just side eye her and say sure because I am not good with confrontation. I either roll belly up or I’ll put my hands on you. I cannot put my hands on her so that’s the best I could come ip with. 
   I have had several Roomates. I know when one is reaching for and creating problems. But I’ve never had to deal with a women who is near the age of my mother doing this. Let alone someone I can’t even speak to. I get she might be insecure, or bored or whatever. I don’t have an option to move as this place was a miracle to find after being homeless due to dv. What am I supposed to do? I already avoid her as much as possible. All of the conflict never even happens face to face. ",2,1745668366.0,badroommates,19,0.6,False

It was one of those uneventful days. There were many uneventful days, but this one was significantly uneventful, and the climate was moody enough to make you sleep.

Yet, I was gripped by *The Dolphin Hotel* and Murakami for his choice of words and the way he weaves his magic, dragging you into his surreal world of characters. You are in their world.

Still, at that time, this blue-eyed blonde—was she blue-eyed? I don’t know; it was dark. Was she at least blonde? I think I was sure that she was blonde, but blue eyes? I don’t know. I was half asleep. I told you, the weather should get its fair share of blame for my sluggishness. On other days, I’m alert. Am I? I don’t know.

I was on a call at that time, and the book was lying down. It was *Dance Dance Dance* by Murakami. I think I already told you about that. She gave me a look, as well as the book. Did she look at me or only at the book? Was it my imagination? When the phone call ended, she was nowhere to be found.

Then I immersed myself in the book and ordered ginger lemon honey. As a traveler, I ought to have this. You know the code, don’t you?

Again, the angel, with or without blue eyes, reappeared. She asked my permission to take some sugar from my table. I would have given her the entire table if she had asked, yet she just wanted the sugar. I passed it over.

Now she was looking at the book, so I asked her, “Are you a fan of Murakami?” Have you ever seen a flower bloom in a close-up shot on a Canon with a 600mm focus? That’s how her face lit up. Mind you, you don’t need a flash to capture that moment.

She spoke about the books of Murakami, and I was under her spell. I acted as if I had listened intently, but I could hear nothing. When angels speak, you don’t need to listen. You just need to be there, in that moment, and lose yourself. That’s what I did.

I suggested she read another book, *Before the Coffee Gets Cold* by another Japanese author. I didn’t remember the author’s name, but I loved reading it at the Delhi airport. Then she left, and I focused on the book. I thought I would gather the courage to go to her table and ask her out for a cup of coffee.

I turned around and saw her with another guy in front of her. He looked at me; he did have blue eyes for sure, as he was staring at me.

I turned back, and I could see Murakami laughing at me and *Dance Dance Dance*—once again, fate. Dance, dance, dance.

I got up, paid the bill at the Snow Lion Cafe, and walked out. Next time, I hope to see her without the villain. Or will I?

Takes about 30-60 minutes to get home depending if I take Uber or the train. 

I used to go to sleep around 10-11pm, wake up at 7:00 am to get coffee and relax in bed til 9am. My sleep started getting better along with more sobriety. Now with my new job and new living arrangements that’s changing and my sleep schedule has been all messed up. 

Now even if I get home at 1:00, I am still up til around 3-3:30. I will set my alarm for 10am or so, but will sleep till 11, 12, 1:00 in the afternoon. Then go to work from 6pm to 2am. 

I also have two roommates in my bedroom at my recovery house and they……. Tbh are loud and inconsiderate sometimes. I’ll get woken up at 6am to this girl talking on the phone then not be able to fall asleep again at all. Then still have things I need to do outside of the house from 10 or 11am to 2am straight so there’s no room for a nap. I don’t usually nap anyways. Even if I try to nap for an hour or two before work, they will be loud and keep me from napping. 

Sooo I rly need to figure out a new sleep schedule. I drank some melatonin tea from the grocery store one night and I got the best sleep ever. The next night it didn’t do anything. I suppose I can just try a regular melatonin pill. But I’m wondering more like what else can I do to get myself to fall asleep as soon as I get home from work? I’m trying to cut back on caffeine at work. Though if I’m up at 10am I need to stay awake til 2am without a nap, I need at least a soda or a coffee when I arrive there. 

Even my days off, I will still stay up til 1am and sleep in so I am used to being awake later than I was before I got this job. I rly need to figure out a good sleep schedule at least til I find a job with different hours earlier in the day cuz I’m not getting any sleep it feels like. Or I’m being woken up consistently. Any suggestions or thoughts would be so helpful. I’m typing this with basically 0 sleep now so, sorry if it’s all over the place. I’m desperate to get some restful sleep after being woken up over and over early this morning. Got a long day ahead of me. I can’t even sleep in on my day off tmr cuz of stuff I have to attend for the recovery house I live at. I can’t even take a nap today again bc of things I need to do before work 80% of my day. 😒😒

I heard like if you sleep 4 hours, wake up for a while, then sleep 4 hours it’s better for you than sleeping 8 hours straight? Is this true at all? I suppose it would take a few nights to start retraining my body on its bedtime but I need a solution. 😔😮‍💨😭


I may have an opportunity to move to a diff bedroom. With 1 person who isn’t loud as shit rather than 2 who are. And a new girl is coming so I could have 1 roommate instead of3 which would be a blessing! Maybe that’ll solve my issue just being in a quieter room. Ok, that’s all.

* Heavy smoker (2 packs/day, for real).
* Constantly drinking coffee (up to 5 cups/day).
* Sleeps at 5 AM almost every day.
* His room is full of trash, but our parents clean it for him.
* His body is getting extremely skinny, bones visible (he wasn’t like this before).
* Extremely toxic social circle: illegal street racing, often bullied, used, and extorted by his peers.
* All of this has been happening since he was 14.

Even before 14, he had:

* Stolen around 10 million IDR from our parents to top up games.
* Bought out a whole food stall to treat his entire class, etc.
* No academic achievements — or any achievements at all.

About our parents:

* Not a broken home. Communicative and financially stable (but planning to retire in a few years).
* They're enablers: they let everything slide, thinking “he’ll change eventually,” and even plan to send him to work abroad later.

About me and my older brother:

* Older brother is already settled with their own family.
* I am working and financially just independent.

What we have tried:

* Talked nicely to our parents → didn’t work.
* Talked nicely to our brother → didn’t work.
* Tried being hard → he became even worse, and our parents blamed us.

My questions:

* What’s wrong with him?
* What’s wrong with our parents?
* How to cope?

1k8ayx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1k8ayx2/why_choose_nostalgia_bst3rr_retro_breakfast/,Why Choose Nostalgia BST3RR Retro Breakfast Station Review for Space-Saving Kitchen Needs?,"The Nostalgia BST3RR Retro 3-in-1 Breakfast Station immediately caught my eye with its vibrant red finish and nostalgic design. It’s a unique and compact appliance aiming to revolutionize breakfast routines. As someone who juggles a busy schedule but loves the concept of tasty homemade breakfasts, this product seemed like a lifesaver. Combining a coffee maker, a non-stick griddle, and a toaster oven into one appliance, it sounded like the Swiss Army knife of morning meal preparation.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The retro aesthetic isn’t just a gimmick—it’s functional and solidly built. The appliance feels robust, though the lightweight nature of its 11.88 pounds makes it easy to maneuver on the countertop. It’s compact enough to fit nicely on small kitchen counters, yet spacious enough to deliver on its promise of being a breakfast hub. The stainless steel dropdown door on the toaster oven feels sturdy, and the dials have that satisfying click when twisted. That being said, while the red certainly adds personality, it might not suit every kitchen color scheme, but hey, it’s retro!  

**Good Aspects**  
- Compact design saves valuable counter space.  
- Multi-functional, eliminating the need for three separate devices.  
- Easy to clean, thanks to the non-stick griddle surface and reusable coffee filter.  

**Coffee Break**  
Some mornings just start better with coffee, and the 3-cup coffee maker integrated into this station is a star player. A glass carafe, reusable filter, and coffee scoop come included, simplifying the entire brewing process. While three cups might not suffice for a caffeine junkie, it’s perfect for my moderate morning fix. I paired it with the toaster oven to toast a bagel while my coffee brewed, and the timing was seamless. However, just something worth noting, compared to standalone coffee makers, the brew takes slightly longer.

[Check Nostalgia BST3RR price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b07wfhz8rm/)

**Family-Sized Griddle for Big Breakfasts**  
As a proud breakfast enthusiast, I loved the large non-stick griddle that came with this station. Cooking bacon alongside eggs and pancakes was effortless, though the griddle’s heat distribution wasn’t perfectly even. Pancakes browned more on the edges than in the center, but the result was still delicious. Cleanup afterward was a breeze since nothing stuck to the surface, and the included glass lid helped manage spatters. With plenty of room for multiple items at once, the griddle lends itself well to family-sized breakfasts or entertaining multiple guests.

**Functions Matter**  
The toaster oven, arguably the hero of the trio, accommodates up to four slices of bread or a small frozen pizza. It toasts bread evenly, though cooking times seemed marginally longer than my dedicated toaster oven. Its versatility is impressive, and I even used it to bake a small batch of cookies for an impromptu dessert. One downside is the lack of pre-set options or digital functionality—it operates purely on knobs, which might feel limiting for those accustomed to modern appliances.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Uneven heat distribution on the griddle.  
- Coffee maker’s small capacity might disappoint coffee enthusiasts.  
- Slightly longer cooking/toasting times compared to standalone tools.  

**Cooking for a Crowd or Just for One**  
This breakfast station is ideal for singles, couples, or small families. Students, dorm residents, or tiny home dwellers would especially appreciate its multifunctional nature. As someone who appreciates a hearty but home-cooked breakfast, I found this machine practical yet whimsical. That said, if you’re an aspiring chef with elaborate breakfast ambitions, you might prefer individual high-performance appliances instead.

**Product Alternatives**  
When comparing this breakfast station to individual appliances, it’s clear that its strength lies in the space-saving combo. However, if you prefer dedicated tools, the Cuisinart Compact AirFryer Toaster Oven offers more cooking features and faster toast times. Similarly, the Breville Bambino Plus espresso machine brews coffee to perfection but doesn’t offer multi-functionality like this retro appliance. The Nostalgia Retro 3-in-1 sacrifices the finesse of individual devices but wins in its ability to operate as an all-in-one.

**Money’s Worth**  
This appliance delivers good value if you consider both its space-saving design and multi-functionality. While it might lack the precision or advanced features of standalone appliances, the charm of having three breakfast essentials combined in one machine is hard to argue against. Perfect as a gift for college students or anyone living in smaller spaces, it’s an appliance built to simplify mornings without breaking the bank. Whether you live alone or are part of a small household, its light price point makes it reasonable for what it delivers.

The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.

“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.

Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.

“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.

She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”

“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”

Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.

The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”

“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”

I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”

As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.

In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.

My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?

“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”

But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.

After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.

‘Mate.’

The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.

‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’

The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.",1,1745667366.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1k8awto,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1k8awto/gravity_paused_to_tie_his_shoelaces/,gravity paused to tie his shoelaces,"i didn't pin Gravity to be the clumsy type

but one thursday morning, he tripped right in front of me, landing with a dull, cosmically uncharacteristic thud and sending a faint cloud of dust in his wake

if it was fate instead, i probably would've laughed a little bit. but laws of the universe are not to be messed with, so i lent Gravity a hand and pulled him back up to his feet

he seemed flustered and breathless - embarrassed, almost

and then, muttering something about ""orbital balance sheets"", he crouched over in the middle of the street to tie his shoelaces

and as he knelt, everything shifted

people suddenly in the air instead of with their feet planted on the ground, like some sort of pseudo space simulator

the rain refused to fall

leaves floated upwards, instead of down, like all those ideas that never quite landed

birds hovered in the air, mid-flight, wings flapping uselessly

a sip of coffee stalled in a throat, heat & caffeine suspended between intention and consequence

everything shook along with Gravity

your goodbye text got lost in the web of the internet, floating into an unknown realm i didn't even know Gravity kept it from going into

your hand, suddenly unsure of how to wave, wasn't able to make that final, parting gesture

your tears, too, unable to drip down your cheeks

if i paused this exact moment, you'd still be here

but then Gravity stood up - dishevelled and grinning, shoelaces secure

and just like that, the sky righted itself

the rain fell, the leaves dropped, birds resumed flight

Gravity gave me a nod, shot me a knowing look

of course he knew. he's Gravity, after all

he'd seen the way i try to keep myself grounded, like the laws of the universe i'd built up so highly in my head

but here he was, his smile said, tripping over his shoelaces just like me

that was three years ago, and somewhere in the middle of that show of orchestrated tripping Gravity put on for me,

i caught the universe in its moment of weakness

like looking into a mirror of stardust

i think we all have more in common with Gravity than we realize

I find myself up early this morning, at the start of a rainy day with a warm cup of coffee and some music. Finally actually able to hear the rain hitting newly formed leaves on the trees this spring season. Thought chatting with some of you fine folks would be a great idea as well.

I'm a communication connoisseur of all types, chit chat, small talk, real talk, deep inquiries, and of course I'm a pretty good ear for those who need to vent or just need to get something of your chest. So come on, try me.

We could have similar or different interests but just to give you an idea of mine, I enjoy being outside and camping and hiking, I read a lot, watch some TV and movies, all that mostly in the sci-fi, fantasy, and horror genres. I also read and collect comics and some manga. And yes I do watch some anime though most of it I do not like. Also enjoy listening to pretty much every kind of music and even try to play some instruments. Also enjoy history and learning about local lore and legends from all over the world. I'll stop this here because it definitely looks like it's getting long but if you feel like some conversation throughout the day or just an occasional check in, feel free to drop me a line! Hope to talk to some of you soon!

Alpha Bram Thorne.

I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.

He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.

My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.

I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.

But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?

When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.

‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.

“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.

He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.",1,1745667171.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

Here comes the FOURTH SEQUEL

After the whole spoon-pie disaster, things were normal for a few hours. That was, until my house became sentient and started calling me “Jerry” for no reason. It demanded I explain the plot of Shrek 2 in full, using interpretive dance. While I was busy looking for a sock puppet to assist in my explanation, Bill Cipher (still partially a spoon-pie hybrid) appeared again, but now he had the power of a haunted coffee machine.

In an attempt to fix things, Bill made a portal to a dimension where ""everything was soup"" — and by soup, I mean soup made of soup, like the entire world was made of various kinds of soup and vegetables with the personality of a middle-aged man going through a mid-life crisis.

Suddenly, a terrifying noise came from the distance, and out of nowhere, a battle-ready waffle with laser eyes appeared. And the only thing it screamed was “I WILL DESTROY ALL NON-BELIEVERS IN WAFFLES.” So, naturally, we started running, but then Gumball and Darwin showed up again, only this time they were driving a car that was also a sentient loaf of bread with an existential crisis.

Meanwhile, Bill — now more pie than spoon but still part eldritch nightmare — decided to summon the entire cast of Scooby-Doo to help us, but instead of Scooby, we got Scrappy-Doo, and he proceeded to scream about “destroying the Waffle Empire” until his words made the entire planet explode like an overcooked pancake.

As the apocalypse unfolded, I realized that I couldn’t escape. My only option was to perform a ritual involving a rubber chicken and a jar of mayonnaise while singing “Take On Me” in a voice only dogs could hear. But before I could finish, Bill screamed in agony, “I'M TURNING INTO A TUNA SANDWICH!” and then, just like that, everything turned into the world’s largest Jenga tower made of spaghetti.

The universe started bending like an Instagram filter, and suddenly, I was in an alternate reality where everyone was just really into alpacas. The alpacas were holding council meetings on how best to implement mandatory napping schedules for all human beings.

Oh, and the mayor of Gravity Falls finally got back to me, demanding that I ""explain the fate of my left shoe,"" or the war would continue.

**Smart and Well-Designed Aesthetics**

The first thing I noticed was how perfectly the sleek gray finish blended with my modern living room décor. With dimensions of 55 x 16 x 24.5 inches, it's not too bulky, yet it offers enough presence to anchor the space. The X-shaped structures on the sides not only add a touch of sophistication but also contribute to its solid framework. I found the vintage-chic design refreshing, compared to standard, characterless TV stands available elsewhere.

**Functional Storage with a Thoughtful Layout**

Storage is often a sticking point for me when it comes to TV stands, but I was pleasantly surprised by this setup. The middle shelf fits my streaming devices and gaming console perfectly, while the side compartments comfortably hold my collection of DVDs and a speaker. With every item neatly arranged, my living area feels both tidy and stylish. Plus, it's accommodating enough to double as a coffee table in smaller setups.

**Ease of Assembly**

If you’ve ever bought furniture that turns into a five-hour DIY project, you can imagine my hesitation when putting this together. Thankfully, this stand didn’t give me that headache! The instructions were clear, and the provided tools made the process smooth. My son even commented on how fun it was to help (he mostly handed me the screws, but it counts). Within about an hour, the new stand was ready for its starring role in our living room.

**Stability That Inspires Confidence**

What truly sets this apart is the stability. The five thoughtfully designed adjustable feet (four at the corners and one in the center) are a small detail with a big impact. They keep the stand level, even on my slightly uneven hardwood floor, and prevent it from wobbling under the weight of a 50-inch TV, which was very reassuring. Not to mention, the engineered wood and iron construction lend even more heft and durability.

**Pluses**

- Flexible and stylish for different interior styles.  
- Compact yet ample storage for gadgets, books, and decor.  
- Stable build with adjustable feet for uneven surfaces.  
- Suitable for TVs up to 65 inches with an 88 lb weight limit.  

**Negatives**

- Lacks integrated cable management, which means cords can look messy without extra effort.  
- The 16-inch depth might feel limiting if you have larger components or prefer a more spacious surface.  

**Competing Products**

When weighing this product against popular alternatives like IKEA's TV stands or those from Walker Edison, the Yaheetech model stands out on a few levels. It's almost as affordable as IKEA offerings, but its X-frame design and storage compartments give it a creative edge. Compared to Walker Edison units, which tend to be chunkier and heavier, this stand remains more lightweight and manageable—ideal if you like to rearrange furniture frequently. On the downside, competitors often come with pre-installed cable management systems, which is a glaring omission here.

**Bang for the Buck**

The value factor is undeniable. Considering its solid build, multi-purpose functionality, and striking style, I'd say it delivers well beyond its price tag. Even higher-end pieces haven't offered me this kind of stability and ease of use. While it’s not perfect, you'd be hard-pressed to find this combination of quality and affordability elsewhere for a TV stand catering to larger screens.

My heart pounded as I sat up and then I saw Elara already awake. As an omega, I’m basically a servant to the pack. Thankfully, Alpha Nicholas assigned me to be a companion to his only daughter. Because if I hadn't been assigned to Elara, I might have ended up being used by the warriors in Wild Heart.

As an omega, they naturally looked down on us and they believed that the life of an omega was worthless. To the members of the pack with higher rank, they believed we only exist to serve them. Thanks to Elara and her father, I didn't experience what other omegas went through. No man has ever dared to disrespect me!

“It must be Daddy…,” she mumbled as if she had an idea what caused the commotion outside her bedroom.

“Let’s check outside,” I proposed, and we hurriedly pulled on our robes before rushing outside.

And because we were in a hurry, we almost bumped into the Beta. He immediately glared upon seeing me as if I was nothing but trash! He was covered in blood, and there were bruises on his arms and face. When our eyes met, I immediately shifted my gaze on the floor. In the entire pack, it was only him who seemed to despise me!

“What happened, Beta Dominic?” Elara asked. “Where’s my father?”

Beta Dominic gasped for air, and his voice was breaking between breaths. “Rogues… they attacked Alpha Nicholas… and he fell off the cliff!”

“He was attacked and you’re here?” I asked and he glared at me.

“Omega, shut the fuck up! You’re not allowed to interfere!” Beta Dominic scolded me in front of everyone.

“Don’t you dare use that tone with Arabella, Beta. I am warning you! Apologize or I will not let her help you with your wounds!”

“I’m sorry, Omega.”

“Her name is Arabella, you shouldn’t forget that, understand? Apologize again,” Elara demanded.

“I apologize for being rude to you, Arabella.”

“It’s okay, Beta. Let’s treat your wounds first,” I offered because I am familiar with treating wounds.

“Thank you, Arabella,” he said before he led the way toward his quarter.

His room was dark, and the air felt thick. When I opened the first aid kit to treat his wounds, I sensed something that didn’t feel right. However, I pushed the thought aside because Beta Dominic was bleeding so I should just focus on treating his wounds.

""Please sit down, Beta. Let me take care of this,"" I said while grabbing a cloth to wipe the blood on his arm.

But, before I could turn back to him, pain shot through my head. He hit me! I stumbled forward as I clutched the back of my head and I couldn’t believe it! I was just trying to help him but Beta Dominic had struck my head!

""Beta!"" I gasped in a quivering voice. When I glanced at him, I saw that his face was full of anger toward me.

""You think you’re safe, Arabella?""

His words were cold, and his eyes narrowed as he moved closer to me. I stepped back, but the room was too small until I was pressed against the wall. I panicked with the way he was looking at me, as if he wanted to devour me in whole! He was furious and all of his anger was directed toward me!

What should I do now?

""You think just because you're an omega and close to Elara, no one can touch you?"" he asked again and I frowned.

“B-Beta, why are you being like this?”

“Shut up, wench!” he shouted.

""Why are you doing this?"" I asked and he laughed. Then, he stepped closer to me, and I felt my back hit the wall already. ""Please,"" I whispered as fear was creeping into my voice. “Just let me go if you don’t want my help,” I begged him but he wasn’t listening. Then, his hand gripped my arm tightly! I shrieked in pain and tried to break free from him.

“Now, I am going to teach you a lesson!” he said as he dragged me toward his bed.

At that moment, I panicked at the thought of being sexually abused. In the pack, it wasn’t unusual for an omega to be treated like that, and I was terrified I would end up like the others. I shook my head in defiance. I couldn’t allow it to happen. No way!

Over my dead body!

Thankfully, before Beta Dominic could do anything to me, there was a loud knock on the door. We both froze. My heart was pounding, but I was relieved when I heard Elara’s voice outside his room.

“Damn it!” he cursed.

Silently, I thanked the Moon Goddess for sending her just in time. As Elara continued to knock outside, Dominic’s grip on my arm loosened a little bit. Then, he looked toward the door and he was clearly frustrated. He knew he couldn’t do anything now that Elara was just outside waiting for me.

“Arabella, are you in there?”

Elara’s voice called again. I pulled my arm free away and then, without looking at Beta Dominic, I ran toward the door. She looked at me, then at Dominic.

“What’s going on? Why was the door locked?” she asked.

Dominic forced a smile and said, “Nothing, Miss. Arabella was just helping me with my wounds,” he lied.

“Very well, Beta, but keep the door open while she’s helping you,” she instructed and I was relieved.

Then, she excused herself to speak with an elder who was in the hallway. When I looked at Beta Dominic again, he was glaring at me and his gaze warned me to behave, or else, something terrible would happen.

“You’re lucky this time, Arabella,” he said but I didn’t respond.

I just focused on the task at hand, and did it swiftly. After helping the beta with his wounds, I went to look for Elara, and found her talking with an elder. I just waited until they’re done before I approached her.

“Is there a problem?” I asked as soon as I noticed the frown on her face.

“You saw that guy, right? He wants to marry me,” she told me, and I chuckled.

“Really? But why? He’s older than your Dad!” I remarked and Elara was even more pissed.

“He is, but he’s worried that someone else might take the pack now that Dad is missing!”

“What are we going to do now? If the others would know we don’t have the Alpha, they might attack Wild Heart in the middle of the night!” I expressed my concern.

“The incident shouldn’t be made public before I have my husband, or else, the pack wouldn’t be safe, Ara.”

“Then, what is your plan now? Don’t tell me, you’re going to marry that dirty old man, Elara!” I cautioned him.

“No way!” she exclaimed and I was glad that she wasn’t so desperate. “Why should I marry him when I already have a fiance? I am already engaged to Alexander Demakis, remember” she reminded me.

“That’s right,” I said, but then the Beta joined us, and he asked to speak with Elara in private.

I was worried but Elara assured me it’s alright. So, I stepped away to give them space, and then I went to the kitchen to get some coffee. I knew Elara needed a cup because she didn’t have enough sleep. We just slept for a couple of hours or so before the commotion happened.

“Where’s the Beta?” I asked when I returned with a tray filled with mugs of hot coffee.

“He went to help the warriors in looking for Dad, but he said something I didn’t wish to hear from him, Arabella,” she said.

“Such as what?” I was curious especially when it’s about Beta Dominic.

“He wants to marry me as well. He explained we can just do it for convenience, like a contract marriage or some kind,” she said and I narrowed my eyes while listening to her speak about the beta’s marriage proposal.",1,1745666628.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1k8akvv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k8akvv/could_the_elite_gourmet_ccm035_coffee_urn_review/,Could the Elite Gourmet CCM-035 coffee urn review reveal perfect brewing for large groups?,"Testing out the Elite Gourmet CCM-035 Maxi-Matic Coffee Urn over the past few weeks has been an experience both rewarding and, at times, mildly frustrating. Designed to serve large groups, this stainless steel coffee urn is purpose-built for events, office break rooms, and parties where caffeine flows as freely as the conversation. Whether you're brewing for a small group of 15 or a thirstier crowd of up to 30, this gadget claims to have you covered. Here are my thoughts, observations, and a few quirky anecdotes from my own usage.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me upon unboxing the coffee urn was its sleek stainless steel design. While not overly flashy, the brushed metal finish lends it an air of premium quality. There's a durability to the build, and at 4.1 pounds, it feels solid yet manageable to carry around. The heat-resistant handles are a nice touch—a small but welcome detail that saved me from a few close calls with hot surfaces. Its cylindrical form allows it to fit snugly on most counters, and the locking lid adds another layer of security. I had to transport the urn once to my cousin’s birthday party, and thanks to these features, there were no messy spills or complaints from the backseat passengers.  

**Ease of Use**  
Setting it up for the first brew was relatively intuitive. The internal water level markings make it easy to fill just the right amount of water for the desired number of cups. I’m glad they included this feature because, without it, I would have been guessing how much coffee my daughter’s book club would down in one sitting. The two-way dispenser came in handy during that same meeting. Guests could flip the lever up to fill a single cup or push it down for larger containers. However, there’s a minor learning curve with this mechanism—several guests ended up with spills because they weren’t used to the way the lever worked.  

**Performance and Brewing Time**  
The Elite Gourmet coffee urn is advertised as brewing roughly one cup of coffee per minute, which held true during my testing. I tried brewing 20 cups one morning as my co-workers trudged into the office, and like clockwork, the entire job was done in 20 minutes. The consistency of the taste was impressive—bold, hot, and fresh, just like a proper percolated coffee should be. But I noticed a slight snag. It’s not the quietest machine I’ve come across. While percolators are inherently noisy, the bubbling sound made during brewing can be oddly distracting in quieter environments.  

**Advantages**  
Here are some strong points I appreciated during my usage:  
- Durable and stylish stainless steel design.  
- Heat-resistant handles for added safety.  
- Quick and efficient brewing for large groups.  
- Easy-to-read water level markings for convenience.

**Clean-Up and Maintenance**  
No one enjoys cleaning up after large gatherings, so I was particularly excited about the claim that certain parts of this coffee maker are dishwasher safe. True to its word, the coffee filter basket cleaned up nicely in the dishwasher. For the rest, like the stainless steel interior, I used a damp soapy cloth to wipe it down, followed by a rinse with fresh water. While cleanup wasn’t what I’d call a breeze, it wasn’t overly burdensome either, which counts as a win in my book.  

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite its many upsides, a few shortcomings became clear:  
- The dispenser’s lever mechanism takes some getting used to.  
- Slightly noisy during the brewing process.  
- The lack of an automatic shut-off feature could be a dealbreaker for forgetful folks like me.  

**Competitive Options**  
When comparing this coffee urn to others in the same category, a couple of things stood out. The Hamilton Beach Commercial Coffee Urn offers similar features but with the added benefit of a dripless spout, which eliminates spills entirely. However, it lacks the stainless steel build quality of the Elite Gourmet. Meanwhile, West Bend’s large-capacity urn is a strong competitor, boasting an automatic temperature control system that keeps coffee warm without overcooking it—something this model doesn’t offer. Still, I’d argue that the Elite Gourmet has a better balance of price to performance, making it a decent choice for frugally minded coffee enthusiasts.  

**Value Assessment**  
At the end of the day, what makes or breaks my decision to recommend a product boils down to one question: Is it worth the investment? For its feature set, including easy cleanup, speedy brewing, and a large capacity, the Elite Gourmet coffee urn delivers respectable value for its cost. Sure, it has areas where it could improve—mainly in noise reduction and an automatic shut-off—but for the purpose it serves, it holds its ground admirably.

1k8aju7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k8aju7/will_the_ember_smart_mug_cm191000us_truly/,Will the Ember Smart Mug CM191000US Truly Revolutionize Coffee Drinking? Review Inside!,"The Ember CM191000US is an intriguing piece of modern technology that I have had the opportunity to use consistently over the past few weeks. As someone who thrives on caffeinated inspiration while working, the phrase “every degree of difference matters” perfectly sums up the allure of this smart coffee mug. By merging sophisticated design with advanced functionality, this smart mug has transformed how I approach drinking coffee.

**Aesthetics and Build Quality**  
From the moment I unboxed the Ember smart mug, its sleek, black, minimalistic design made an impression. The solid exterior is complemented by a scratch-resistant finish, which is great since I handle my mugs a little recklessly sometimes. Weighing in at 1 pound, it's slightly heftier than a typical mug, but the robust feel immediately reassures you of its build quality. The handle is ergonomically designed, ensuring a comfortable grip even if you hold your coffee for extended ones-on-one Ponder Sessions at work.

**Temperature Control and Practical Use**  
The standout feature is, of course, the mug’s ability to maintain your chosen drink temperature. This functionality brought a layer of control I didn’t even realize I needed. I prefer my coffee at 135°F, so pairing the mug with its companion app was incredibly easy. Once set, the mug kept my drink perfectly heated for nearly 80 minutes, which is impressive for battery-powered temperature control. Alternatively, I discovered that placing it back on the charging base extended this runtime even further, particularly useful during those all-day brainstorming marathons.

**User Experience and the App**  
The app experience was seamless during the initial setup. It lets you fine-tune the temperature and even creates presets for different beverages—useful for someone like me who switches between coffee, tea, and the occasional hot chocolate. The app isn't strictly necessary, though, as the mug memorizes the previously set temperature. Yet, not everything about the app is perfect. For instance, disconnecting and re-pairing the mug every so often was a bit of a quirk that left me somewhat frustrated. It’s not a dealbreaker but shows room for improvement on the software side.

**Advantages**  
- Keeps beverages consistently hot for up to 80 minutes when charged.  
- Intuitive app with customizable temperature settings.  
- Stylish and scratch-resistant build.  
- Automatic sleep and wake-up functions save battery life intelligently.  

**Battery Life and Charging Time**  
The battery performance can be a mixed bag. While the mug manages to keep beverages heated for a commendable duration of up to 80 minutes, recharging takes quite a bit of patience—over two hours for a full charge. I made it a habit to place the mug on its charging coaster after every use to avoid waiting the next time I needed it. This charging-to-usage ratio might deter impatient people or those who expect longer battery performance.

**Flaws**  
- Lengthy recharge times can disrupt its convenience.  
- Occasional Bluetooth disconnections demand app pairing again.  
- No physical control options for room-temperature liquids, which the mug does not recognize as “full.”

**Design Challenges for Left-Handed Users**  
A quirky observation from my left-handed coworker is that the LED indicator—which provides feedback and status—is positioned for right-handed individuals. It’s a minor inconvenience unless you need to monitor the setting regularly.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this smart mug to its market rivals, it notably outshines basic thermos-style mugs, which lack temperature personalization features and tend to let coffee cool within 30 minutes. Brands like Zojirushi and Contigo might offer stellar insulation for longer durations, but they lack the modern smart features Ember provides. On the other hand, the Ember stands on relatively equal footing with others in its price range, like the Cauldryn smart mug. However, Ember’s superior design and user experience do give it an edge despite its quirks.

**True Value**  
With its sleek package of app-controlled technology and thoughtful auto-wake abilities, the product does feel worth investing in for tech enthusiasts or coffee aficionados who hate lukewarm sips. Granted, it isn’t the cheapest insulated mug out there, but its design-forward approach makes it a functional luxury. Reviewing the value feels subjective—if rapid charging or budget-friendly alternatives are your priority, this might not rank as high.

Her trip was such a flop and people were so tunes off - she got 29k views, and that’s with 250k+ subscribers. Barely 10%. 

The next video got more views most likely because she added the *car chat catch up* and that’s usually when INTERESTING creators talk about what’s going on in their lives. For Amanda it was probably a curly hair routine, reset after cutter and that’s it. 

Her already infamous fertility journey video has not even been up 24 hours, and it’s got 111k views. A topic she vowed NEVER to discuss.

As others have pointed out- there hasn’t been a single creator who has taken you on their “fertility journey” who didn’t end the series or topic happily pregnant. So clearly she is already pregnant. 

The video has more adverts than usual, which also adds to the fact it’s all for money. 

It’s also a distraction from the long discussed topic of them still using Sephora and Amazon despite the boycott. That will become old news as all the fans will be posting comments of sympathy rather than calling out her actions.

As someone always in need of more ice—whether it’s for a party, keeping drinks perfectly chilled, or just having cold water on a hot day—I was genuinely intrigued by the **DUMOS Ice Maker Countertop 8342**. After spending a few weeks testing it nearly every day, I have plenty of thoughts. It’s a neat little machine with some impressive features, but like all devices, it’s not without its quirks.

**Sleek and Convenient Design**

The compact design stole the show right from the unboxing. Its dimensions—11.5""D x 8.9""W x 12.4""H—make it small enough to fit on almost any kitchen or bar counter. The portability factor is a big win. Weighing only about 16.95 pounds and boasting a carry handle, I was able to move it between my kitchen and the patio for an evening barbeque with zero struggle. Its clean black finish and transparent window on top give it a modern vibe, so it doesn’t look out of place anywhere. The window lets you see the ice-making process, which, let me tell you, became an oddly satisfying feature for everyone in the house.

**Fast Ice Production**

The speed at which this countertop ice maker churns out ice cubes is no joke. In just six minutes, nine perfectly-rounded bullet-shaped ice cubes are ready to go. This was a game-changer during my cousin’s housewarming party when the ice supply ran out mid-event. Having the ability to make up to 26.5 pounds of ice in 24 hours means there’s no need to rush to the store for overpriced party bags of ice anymore. It handles gatherings efficiently without breaking a sweat.

**Advantages**

- Produces ice quickly, with the first batch ready in six minutes.
- Compact size and lightweight design make it easy to move and store.
- Transparent window allows for a fun visual of ice production.
- Fits perfectly in a variety of settings: kitchens, bars, RVs, and even during camping trips.  

[Check DUMOS Ice Maker Countertop 8342 price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0drdbqvbq/)

**Ice Size Versatility**

This machine lets you choose between two ice cube sizes: small and large. I found the smaller cubes to be excellent for keeping seafood chilled on a tray during dinner parties, while the larger ones cooled drinks rapidly without watering them down too fast. The bullet-shaped ice is noticeably smooth, and it didn’t chip or hurt my teeth when I unconsciously bit into one while sipping an iced coffee. That level of thoughtful design honestly surprised me.

**Self-Cleaning Made Easy**

The self-cleaning function is such a relief for someone like me who dreads appliance maintenance. Turning on the clean cycle was as easy as holding the on/off button for five seconds. The process cut down on the hassle of manual scrubbing and made me feel confident knowing the ice would stay hygienic and free from mineral buildup. Plus, the removable ice basket and included scoop made fetching ice super convenient and mess-free.

**Smart Operation with Quiet Performance**

The control panel couldn’t be simpler to operate. With just three basic steps, fresh ice is ready before you know it. At one point, I accidentally left the ice maker running too long, and the ""ice full"" indicator lit up on time to prevent any overflow. The ""add water"" alert was also quite handy when I forgot to refill it. What impressed me equally was the low noise level—it runs at less than 40dB, which is quieter than my refrigerator. I ran the machine late at night without disturbing my light-sleeping roommate.

**Negatives**

- May occasionally struggle to keep up with very large, fast-paced gatherings.
- Small water tank (1.5L capacity) needs frequent refilling during heavy use.

**Rival Brands**

Over the years, I’ve tried my fair share of portable ice makers. When pitted against names like Euhomy and Igloo, this compact gem held its own. For instance, the Euhomy models I’ve tested tend to have slightly larger capacities, but they’re often bulkier and harder to move. The Igloo ice makers boast slightly larger ice storage bins, yet they take longer to produce ice in my experience. On the flip side, the DUMOS ice maker feels like the balanced middle ground—fast, portable, and effective without leaning too far into one extreme.

**Cost Efficiency**

With the compact size and extra utility features it offers, this machine proves to be a smart investment, especially for anyone who regularly entertains guests. While you might find cheaper options, they often lack extras like the self-cleaning function or multiple ice size settings. The price point feels fair for what it brings to the table. For its versatility and convenience alone, this product punches above its weight and justifies the cost.

During my college years at Lords Institute of Engineering & Technology in Hyderabad, I stumbled upon a lesson that would quietly rewrite the course of my life.  
Not through any grand event or sudden breakthrough — but through something deceptively small: **spending one hour a day on myself**.

Back then, life was loud and chaotic. Assignments, classes, exams, and endless chatter filled my days. Like many students, I floated through it all, feeling half-present, surviving more than thriving. Dreams felt distant, buried under the weight of day-to-day busyness.

But there was a voice inside — stubborn, persistent — whispering that I was meant for something more.  
I didn’t know what that “more” was. I just knew I had to try.

One evening, after another long day of lectures and mindless scrolling, I opened my laptop and made a quiet decision:  
**One hour a day. For me. For building my future.**

No matter how busy, tired, or distracted I was, I promised myself I’d dedicate one solid hour every single day to learning something useful — **writing** or **coding**.

# The First Struggle: Fighting Old Habits

The first week was painful.  
Setting aside that one hour meant wrestling against years of lazy habits.

There was always an excuse:

* “I’ll start tomorrow.”
* “Today was exhausting.”
* “What’s the point? One hour won’t change anything.”

But somehow, I kept coming back to that chair every evening, laptop open, notebook ready.

Sometimes I wrote short reflections — random thoughts, college memories, silly dreams.  
Sometimes I attempted basic coding exercises — messy, frustrating, full of errors.

It was hardly glamorous. No big achievements. No followers. No applause.

But something small and invisible was happening inside me.  
**I was showing up for myself.**

# The Magic of Compounding

Weeks turned into months.  
Without realizing it, that single hour began to weave itself into the fabric of my identity.

I noticed it first in my writing — ideas that once felt jumbled now flowed smoother. I started blogging casually, sharing small articles about student life and tech.  
A few likes, a few comments — not much, but enough to fuel my fire.

In coding, the journey was even slower.  
Every bug felt like a mountain.  
But after dozens of hours, syntax errors became manageable.  
I could build basic websites. Then slightly better ones. Then slightly better still.

It was around this time that I discovered freelancing platforms.  
“Maybe,” I thought, “someone out there would pay for what I’m learning.”

I created simple profiles, nervously listed my services, and waited.  
Days passed. Then weeks.  
Then — a tiny gig. Writing a product description for a local brand. Paid just ₹500.  
I will never forget that feeling: not because of the money, but because it proved something to me.

**This was real. This was possible.**

# Hyderabad Nights: My Silent Witness

Living in Hyderabad gave the perfect backdrop to my journey.  
The city itself feels like a mix of old and new — a place where centuries-old markets stand next to glass towers of tech startups.

Some nights, after finishing my one-hour ritual, I would walk around the neighborhood.  
The cool breeze carried the aroma of street food — biryani, samosas, Irani chai.  
The hum of conversations, the distant honk of auto-rickshaws — all of it felt alive, electric.

I often thought about how many other young people, just like me, were dreaming quietly in this city.  
Working silently on invisible futures.

# Growth Beyond Expectations

By my final year in college, things had shifted dramatically.

* I had completed over 30 freelance projects — both writing and basic web development.
* I was earning side income that helped me pay for personal expenses.
* More importantly, I had built confidence — the kind that no degree or classroom could give.

It wasn’t just about skills.  
It was about knowing that I had the power to shape my own destiny, bit by bit, hour by hour.

My professors noticed the change.  
Friends started asking me for tips on freelancing and productivity.

The boy who once procrastinated everything was now the one encouraging others to start.

# Lessons I Carry Even Today

Today, as I continue my career — writing, building digital products, collaborating on bigger projects — the one-hour habit still lives inside me.

Sure, life gets busier.  
Some days are packed with meetings, deadlines, endless notifications.

But the rule remains sacred:

**One hour for growth. No matter what.**

It doesn’t have to be heroic.  
It doesn’t have to be perfect.

Some days I read.  
Some days I brainstorm ideas.  
Some days I simply sit and plan.

But I always honor that one hour, because it reminds me who I am and how far I’ve come.  
Final Thoughts: Why Small Habits Matter

Looking back, I realize something important:

**Big changes don’t come from big decisions.**  
They come from small, boring, consistent ones.

One hour a day may seem insignificant.  
But over time, it compounds into something extraordinary:

* New skills
* New confidence
* New opportunities
* New life

If you’re reading this and feeling stuck, let me tell you — you don’t need to change everything overnight.  
You don’t need a perfect plan.  
You don’t need endless motivation.

You just need to start.  
**One hour. One commitment. One act of faith in your future.**

The rest will take care of itself.

## Understanding the Value Proposition: Why Consider AppleCare+ for AirPods?

AirPods are convenient, sleek, and sound fantastic. But let’s face it: they're also small, easily misplaced, and prone to accidental damage.

This is where an apple airpods extended warranty like AppleCare+ steps in, offering a safety net against these unpredictable situations.

This is an example of a prompt for a living room I wrote:   
  
Inside a serene, Mediterranean-inspired luxury hotel suite living room, crafted with cast-in-place microcement floors and walls in soft, sandy beige tones. The room embraces a sculptural, monolithic aesthetic where architecture and furnishings flow seamlessly into one another. A built-in sofa, upholstered in natural sandy beige fabric, runs along one wall, blending quietly into the surrounding microcement. Layered with accent pillows in toasted yellow, deep indigo, soft turquoise, and natural sand hues, the sofa adds gentle vibrancy to the otherwise calm, earthy palette.

Soft, sheer linen curtains, loosely draped over expansive **floor-to-ceiling sliding glass doors that cover the entire wall**, allow more daylight to filter into the living space, bathing the sandy textures and natural materials in a delicate, shifting desert light. Beyond the glass, a beautifully framed **outdoor lounging deck** extends directly into the open desert basin, with **no perimeter walls**, allowing for an **uninterrupted, seamless view of the vast landscape**. The deck is furnished with sculptural lounge chairs and low tables arranged atop a **large outdoor woven rug** in muted earthy tones, adding a layer of softness and definition to the space. Cozy, textured **blankets are casually draped over the outdoor furniture**, inviting guests to linger and relax under the changing desert sky.

At the heart of the indoor seating area, a **pair of sculptural, refined nesting coffee tables** anchor the room. Each table features an organically shaped, asymmetrical top with an elegantly slim, tapered profile, crafted from hand-finished hardwood in a warm toasted clay tone. The matte, mineral-pigmented surface reveals subtle hand-tooled textures, evoking wind-sculpted desert stones. A delicate brushed bronze inlay traces the outer rim of the larger table, adding a restrained metallic signature. The tables rest on three slightly inset, slender faceted legs, hand-carved to reference traditional desert craftsmanship, giving the composition a light, floating architectural quality. Both tables are grounded by a large **handwoven jute rug** with terracotta and blue accents, which layers additional warmth and visual anchoring beneath the sculptural forms.

Above the sofa, a framed art piece created with natural earth pigments — in tones of sienna, rust, and mineral blue — displays minimalist, abstract forms inspired by desert cartography and ancient trade routes, honoring Ras Al Khaimah’s cultural heritage. A hanging textile art piece woven with repeating mashrabiya motifs adds another layer of crafted texture to the environment.

Nestled discreetly near the glass doors, a sleek, polished telescope stands ready for guests to use at night, inviting contemplative stargazing across the desert basin and offering a poetic connection between the interior’s stillness and the infinite sky beyond.

Indirect lighting washes across the microcement walls, casting soft relief shadows, while a sculptural wooden ceiling fan floats overhead, enhancing the organic materiality of the room. The golden-hour light enriches every element — the microcement, the woven textures, the artisan-carved tables, the glint of the bronze inlays — evoking a profound sense of timeless, quiet desert luxury deeply connected to Ras Al Khaimah’s roots.

**Camera position**: The camera is positioned at a seated eye level, drawing the viewer into the living room’s heart. It frames the built-in sofa, the sculptural custom coffee tables resting on the textured rug, the warm layering of natural materials, and the expansive view toward the outdoor lounging deck and the endless desert beyond. The composition feels immersive and contemplative, emphasizing handcrafted detail, cultural resonance, and the seamless indoor-outdoor flow of desert life.  
  
The result is quite good. Not perfect but does the job.

About Me (aka: Who’s This Guy?)

29 | Based in Europe | Functioning Adult™
I work with people (sometimes the tiny kind, sometimes the chaotic kind) and it’s a job that’s taught me empathy, patience, and how to survive on zero sleep and too much coffee.

I’m an introvert by nature but warm up fast. Once I feel comfortable, I go from quiet thinker to “here’s a playlist I made that accidentally tells you too much about me.”

Here’s what keeps me going:

Music – My playlists go from soft indie ballads to aggressive boss battle themes and then back to lo-fi in under 3 tracks.

Movies – I’ll happily dissect a masterpiece or watch the worst rom-com on Netflix just for fun. Bonus points if you can quote bad dialogue with a straight face.

Gaming – I lean toward story-rich single-player adventures, but if you want to team up for something chaotic and hilarious, I’m in.

Books & Writing – I love getting lost in good fiction or oddly specific Wikipedia holes. I write when I can, even if it’s mostly half-finished Google Docs for now.

Creative things – Drawing, brainstorming, daydreaming. I'm in my “figure-it-out” era and loving the process.

Curiosity – I will absolutely watch a 40-minute video essay on a topic I’ll forget by next week—but I’ll be very passionate about it in the moment.

Who I’m Hoping to Meet:

I don’t have a long list or a rigid “type.” Honestly, I just want to talk to someone kind, curious, and open-minded—someone who wants to connect beyond “wyd.”

Bonus points if:

You enjoy silly, deep, or totally random conversations (or all three in one sitting).

You’re a fan of movie nights, music swaps, or virtual hangouts.

You can handle sarcasm, witty banter, and occasional existential spirals at ungodly hours.

You’re open to a relationship if the vibe’s right, and maybe even the idea of a family someday (no rush, no pressure—just openness).

You’re cool with exchanging pics when it feels natural, not weird.

You’re down to move to another chat platform if Reddit starts feeling like a weird third wheel.

Why Message Me?

Because you’re tired of talking to bots, dry texters, or people who vanish mid-convo.
Because you want someone who actually reads your replies.
Because you want to connect with someone who listens, laughs, and is willing to see where things go.
Because you're secretly a cat in human form. Or you just like cats. That works too.

At the very least, we might have a fun, thoughtful chat. At best? Well... let’s not spoil the ending just yet.

Users across Amazon use fast visuals to choose between numerous items and make well-informed buying decisions.

 The combination of visual aids through Amazon comparison images presents a major advantage to Amazon FBA sellers in the marketplace. Through clear presentation of differences and advantages and leadership attributes your images make customers identify your product as the superior choice instantly.

 Correctly implemented Amazon comparison images create immediate attention which leads to both higher credibility in your listings and more conversions along with separate listing positioning. 

The time has come to convert undecided shoppers into devoted customers. Your product listings can reach higher heights through well-planned comparison images.

# Make the Design Simple and Neat

It should not be very difficult for you to figure out the easy comparison image. Amazon shoppers make purchasing decisions in a snap, literally, given they make purchasing decisions in seconds after viewing a product listing.

 Too much text, flashy graphics and distracting background in your comparison image make it hard for buyers to pick out the important differences between your product and the others.

It is about maintaining only the needed information in a structured manner to create a clean design. For instance, if you are selling a stainless steel water bottle, you have three main points that you could beat compared to: durability, insulation time, and leak proof design.

* Take away long descriptions under each feature and just simply write short, direct text like ‘Keeps Water Cold for 24 Hours’ instead of ‘Using high quality insulation our bottle keeps water cold for the whole day.’

It also makes the file more readable with a structured layout. Sections should be evenly spaced, and comparison points should be visually different from one another. 

The best side by side layout works best in this case as shoppers will be able to quickly differentiate between two products. Place no more than a few elements into a single image at once, so as not to overload the viewer.

* For instance, if you are comparing your water bottle to a plastic alternative, your comparison image should be so clear that there is visual cue on how different they are. 
* For instance, after dropping both a dented plastic bottle and your undamaged stainless steel bottle, you could show a real life image of the bottle on your left. Text based comparison of these graphs is much less effective than this kind of visual storytelling.

Also, try to stay away from colors, shadows, or decorative fonts that decrease the readability. Go for a minimalist design, use the white or light colored background where the product and the key text should easily be focused on. 

# High Quality Image for Professional Look

High quality images are associated with high quality products. It’s important that your comparison image is not blurry, pixelated or has low resolution product photos because it reflects unprofessionally and your brand as an unreliable one. 

Good images to communicate makes a customer feel that they can trust and also feel more credible which will persuade them to choose your product above a competitor’s product.

Make sure you always use high resolution product photos of your comparison images in order to look professional. Using your own professional product shots instead of stock images is the preferable course. 

* Take the screen protectors for a smartphone as an example; their comparison images will include close up, high resolution photos of two phone screens (with and without the protector). There should be a visual difference in clarity, brightness and sharpness to the buyer.

Image quality also depends on lighting. Well-lit images showcase the details of your product more effectively. When photographing your own products, use natural lighting or a lightbox to take the shadows out of your image and have evenly distributed lighting throughout the image.

Image format and resolution is another vital thing in keeping a professional look. Amazon suggests that images have at least 1000 pixels on the longest edge so that the zoom works properly. A comparison image should include all elements that are sharp and legible even when zoomed in.

Lastly, don’t use heavily edited, unrealistic visuals because this can have customers think they’re misled. When your product is a kitchen knife, don’t show a metal cut if your knife is not made for this. False or overly hyped visuals can result in disappointed customers, bad reviews which would hurt your products reputation.

# It’s Important To Highlight Key Differences You Have That Matter To Buyers

When creating a comparison image it should not be remembered to make comparison on the characteristics influencing the buying decisions. However, some [Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/what-are-some-training-videos-for-new-amazon-fba-sellers/) often make a mistake of including details that matter little in the buyer’s choice. 

So for instance, if you are talking about the ergonomic office chair, do not say ‘it comes in various colors’, because it is a matter of personal preference. Instead, highlight differences in:

* Lumbar Support: Is lumbar support adjustable in your competitor’s chair, which they don’t do otherwise?
* The chair material quality: Do you have a breathable chair mesh, that you don’t? Some are made from cheap fabric.
* Weight Capacity: The amount of weight the chair can support often determines its durability, especially when it comes to a longer period of use.

Shoppers don’t want to just see real benefits, but rather, they expect real benefits that matter to them as they use products in their daily life. 

* For instance, if a better lumbar support available in your chair alleviates the back pain, share the comparison image of a user sitting on your chair with the proper posture and compare this to your competitor’s chair in which the user is not comfortable. Marked improvements in user experience are easy to articulate in comparison to a simple textual depiction on how your product makes a difference.

Also, side by side numbers or statistics help the customers understand the superiority of the product. An effective comparison image for your product, if it were a portable charger, could look like:

* Your charger: 20,000mAh – Charges Phone 5x
* Competitor: 10,000mAh – Charges Phone 2x

Since these numerical differences are clear, shoppers can easily tell why your product is the better choice.

# Contrasting Colors Are Better For Better Readability

Color contrast is critical when designing Amazon comparison images. Choosing the right colors helps to highlight important product features and thereby make it easier to read for the buyers.

Readability is achieved with white text on a black background or with dark text on a light background. Bold, contrasting colors such as red and green can be used in a strategic manner as well. An example is to use:

* Green checkmark for strengths
* Red cross for weaknesses

In doing so, this instantly communicates which product has better values. Comparing your earbuds which have 20 hours battery life with one of your competitors which most probably has 8 hours of battery life in either bold text or green and red highlights will assist shoppers in making a decision in less than a second.

Nevertheless, avoid vivid neon colors and rich backgrounds that will impede readability. Use professional, Amazon approved colors such as:

* White or light gray backgrounds
* Black, blue, or dark gray text for clarity
* Green for positive features, red for disadvantages

The most crucial component of your comparison image should be a well-balanced color scheme that ensures the important points in the image are easily usable without distracting the viewer from your product.

# Use Check Marks and Crosses to Simplify Comparisons

It is quite common for shopping clients to make decisions in a matter of seconds after seeing a product listing. To communicate your product’s benefits quickly to the client, one very effective way to achieve this is by using green checkmarks (✅) and red crosses (❌) in a comparison image. 

This way of doing product comparisons very simply demonstrates how you are a better provider than your competitors thus making it easier for a customer to decide on something to buy.

* For example, suppose you offer a robot vacuum; a comparison picture may include the main functional differences of self-charge capability, HEPA filter inclusion, and runtime. What do you think about a simple yet effective design like “Self-Charging: ✅ | Competitor: ❌” and “HEPA Filter: ✅ | Competitor: ❌” with a straightforward layout? Online buyers usually browse rather than read every word, so such a straightforward visual format is meant to understand at a glance.

To reach the desired outcome, it’s essential that the written content is larger than or at least equal to the font size of one “capitalized” typeface, in capital letters. The distinctiveness of being “bold” will be mainly in its physical dimension.

 The reason for requiring such a big font is that people usually do their Amazon-related work on their mobile phones. The readability factor thus remains a critical factor. 

Firstly, you should care that the difference between your text and symbols and those of your competitors are their smallest and recognizable proportions, don’t you think? 

People will not send this part of the process directly to the product page if it is too small. In addition, enhancing the clarity of differences using clean and uncomplicated designs is the other side of the “comparison” sword, proceeding to the purchase is very expensive.

# Keep Text Short and Direct

Shoppers on Amazon are not usually the type of users who do thorough investigations of attributes in lengthy product descriptions among various images. In fact, they tend to look for important straightforward information to quickly confront the fact and buy the product. 

Conversely, putting an image with many, long sentences as well as non-related and elaborated points in one area would not probably be the best approach. Preference should then be given to short phrases which would instantly take in the substance of the advertisement.

* For instance, in the case of a smartwatch, an excellent comparison image should highlight crucial differentiators, like battery longevity, water resistance, and the ability to monitor heart rates. A simple and focused method such as “Battery Life: 24H vs. 8H” or “Waterproof: Yes vs. No” will allow customers to be able to compare the quality of various products without further explanation. 
* Instead of saying that “Our smartwatch lasts 24 hours on a single charge, whereas the competitor’s only lasts 8 hours”, using “Battery Life: 24H vs. 8H” makes the image more powerful.

This approach is particularly advantageous for mobile users as it does not drown them in excessive text. By ensuring that the most pertinent selling points are clearly visible right away, Amazon FBA sellers can improve user engagement and encourage conversion.

# Ensure Accurate and Honest Comparisons

Nevertheless, while pointing out the benefits of a product is important, overestimating its functions or making deceptive claims can have a negative effect on the brand in the long run. 

Customers prefer honesty, and if they feel misguided, it can cause bad reviews, returns, or even grievances that might damage the [Amazon FBA seller’s](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-mws-keys-essential-for-fba-sellers/) integrity. Furthermore, Amazon has strict regulations against misleading statements, and non-compliance can result in suspension of the listing.

* For instance, if a running shoe weighs 200 grams, proclaiming it as the “lightest shoe ever” without any industry-wide data can be a gamble. Instead, it is better to make a comparison image that shows some factual differences such as “Weight: 200g vs. 300g”, where customers’ opinions on which one is better would be based on real differences seen by them.

 Moreover, by providing actual, verifiable disparities, sellers build credibility and maintain their account status with compliance with Amazon policies.

# Use Side-by-Side Product Shots for Visual Impact

One of the limitations with plain words is that they seldom can communicate all the beneficial features or characteristics of a product. By showing side-by-side photos of the real things, one can note the outstanding differences in a zealous and persuasive way.

 That is one of the best techniques that one can use to show a product’s features like its robustness, size, or any improvements in the quality of the product.

* So for instance, when advertising a water-consuming appliance, it will be quite effective to place an illustration of a water bottle filled through a filter and a competitor’s one that is cloudy from hard water minerals besides it. 
* The customer can see the good performance of the filter the product has by just looking at the pictures. Likewise, a stain removal agent could also be promoted using a picture taken before and one taken after the cleaning process to depict how effective it was on the surface.

For the most impact, it is crucial the pictures of the product to be of high resolution and well-illuminated so that it is very easy to observe the differences. This method helps in enhancing credibility and creating an entertaining experience for the participants, thus building strong connections with potential customers.

# Incorporate Real-World Use Cases

When customers get a real-world example of a product’s usage, it makes them connect with it better. You can draw stronger emotional and rational appeals by not just stating features but by also having everyday demonstrations.

* For example, when demonstrating the product of noise-filtering headphones, you could use two people: one who is totally enjoying his music in a busy café and the other who is unable to hear any sound and only the noise of the other customers is visible. This transformation in the product’s evaluation is a clearer way for them to see how it can benefit them in the actual world.

Incorporating applicable use cases into comparison visuals allows sellers to forge a more substantial relationship with their customers, thereby rendering it simpler for them to picture how the product can make a difference in their existence.

# Highlight Warranty or Customer Support Differences

Warranties and customer support for products remain two significant parameters that affect the purchasing process, particularly, in the case of electronic or major appliances where the price tag is higher.

 In the forefront, comparison images should disclose the ability of the product to be one of those for which have longer warranties or also good customer support especially when the product is of high price.

* A comparison wherein the seller is offering a 2-year warranty as an advantage against the competitor’s 6-month warranty should be emphasized. A comparison image that proclaims “Warranty: 2 Years ✅ | 6 Months ❌” instantly assures customers that they are investing in a safer product. The difference in the support features stated like “24/7 Customer Support ✅ | No Support ❌” would give an extra layer of trust.

The strategy of this could not only make the product more trustworthy but also help to place it as a better option increasing the rate of conversion.

# Optimize for Mobile Viewing

A great many Amazon consumers search for and buy products through their mobile phones. Abiding therefore by a mobile-friendly design is the most paramount element of a comparison image. 

Comparatively, smaller text, over-crowded designs, and too many details can all make it difficult to discern the images on a smaller screen making them much less effective.

[Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-does-the-new-seller-guide-affect-amazon-fba-sales-in-90-days/) should come up with mobile-friendly comparison images by using bold font types, uncomplicated graphical representation, and not against resizing the words for a smaller screen to accommodate more stuff in a photo. 

* For example, by the occasion of selling pet brushes that groom the animals, one can make an infographic with the headings, “Yes, Gentle Bristles: ✅ | No, Harsh Bristles: ❌” and “Yes, Pain-Free Grooming: ✅ | No, Causes Discomfort: ❌.” The consideration of increasing clarity on mobile platforms and involvement will in the end increase customer interaction and comprehension.

# Showcase Certifications and Safety Standards

The importance of certifications in the perception of the credibility of a product is appreciated. This is one of the three important factors by which the shoppers mainly judge the quality.

 The comparison images should be the ones with a big size for the products that have all the certification such as USDA Organic, FDA Approved, or CE Certified.

* If you are selling organic baby lotion, a comparison image that states “USDA Certified Organic: ✅ | No Certification: ❌” instantly distinguishes it from non-certified alternatives. The majority of safety-conscious consumers prefer certified goods instead of those that are not.

Inclusion of certifications in comparison images enhances the product’s credibility and establishes potential buyers’ trust in the seller.

# Demonstrate Durability Through Visuals

When the feature of durability is a significant selling point, it should be presented visually, and not only in textual form. Being exposed to a product that demonstrates its ability to resist severe conditions has a more persuasive impact on a potential client than reading about it.

* For instance, if shockproof phone cases are sold, putting a strong comparison image in the selling process that one phone case survives a drop test while a competitor’s case like a cracked one under the same conditions. It is marketing through visual proof that suggests the reliability of the product and plays a vital role in the purchase decision.

# Use Infographic-Style Comparisons for Clarity

Network products are quite different and there is often confusion caused between them. [Amazon Infographics](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/) style comparison comes in handy here. And it helps the tech industry, especially with multiple feature comparisons, to be easily digestible.

* For instance, in the case of a fitness tracker one could create a comparison infographic that would showcase battery life, heart rate monitoring, and GPS tracking sections in an organized table manner. A well-structured layout allows customers to determine the principal distinctions without any ambiguity.

# Align with Amazon’s Image Guidelines

Amazon has very stringent rules about [product images](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/are-your-amazon-product-images-speaking-directly-to-buyers-needs/) and any violation could lead to either a listing of the product being withheld or taken down. Competitors’ brand names or logos must not be included in the images.

 The comparison images must also have at least 1000 px resolution and they must not contain unreasonable assertions.

By strictly following Amazon’s regulations, sellers can use their boldness to produce persuasive, rule-adhering comparisons using images which will thus create product exposure and recommend an increase in sales.

# Displaying Before-and-After Results in Comparison Images

# Showcase Real-World Scenarios for Relatability

Before-and-after images can be made more useful by letting them reflect real-life situations that customers can relate to. If the comparison looks so set up or unrealistic, it can lead to the possible buyers getting disconnected from your promotional material.

 Realistic body language will highlight the vital aspects of the customer’s lifestyle in which the product fits in a way that the user easily simulates, increasing the purchase likelihood.

* For example, a vacuum cleaner brand may display a “before” shot of a carpet almost fully covered with pet hair, real dirt, and crumbs which is later by the perfect clean “after” photo showing the same rug. This not only gives an account of the proficiency of the product but also resonates with the comparison best with the pet owners and family-tied households. Instead of merely declaring boldness as a capability of the vacuum, the practical approach shows the action of this feature.
* Another example is a furniture polish brand that shows an old wooden table with scratches, stains, and dullness in the “before” image, followed by a brilliant, polished surface in the “after” image. This comparison allows clients to project their product usage scenarios and visualize, instead of just being mere assumptions made on generic claims the polarity of which is not real.

More specifically, the consumers of the day are often the same people portrayed in the before-and-after visuals of the campaign. For example, a teeth-whitening product may feature the “before” image as the stained teeth of a coffee drinker and the “after” image as those of the person with noticeably whiter teeth. 

This directly addresses the teeth discoloration problem of coffee consumers, making the change more relatable.

To increase credibility, applying real client photos in before-and-after images tends to fortify the aspect of relatability. The product’s genuineness is increased when shoppers see others like them achieving the goals that similar products promised.

 To boost the feeling of credibility and the fact that many others like them are also in the same boat, you may want users to submit actual before-and-after images with brief testimonials of their own.

By making sure that the transformations are talking through common matters and solutions, the before-and-after images become useful and allow for more emotional connections with buyers. In other words, a person is more likely to try a product if they can imagine themselves getting similar results.

# Guarantee That Differences Are Noticeable at a Glance

This is the way that a before-and-after comparison becomes successful, that is when the difference is perceptible right from the start. If shoppers have trouble telling which one’s the before and which one’s the after, the whole image is wasted.

 The change should be evident enough that the viewer, even if he just glances at the photo, can catch the improvement.

* For example, a weight-loss supplement can utilize an approach in which the data is shown in the way of a graphic. The initial state before the product is applied is shown to the side of the new dimension after its use with a clear decrease in the size. If the difference is insignificant, then focusing on the specifics of the change, such as an apparent reduction in the waist circumference, can help to realize the transition more obviously. In the absence of a general change, users may not believe in the power of the item they would like to buy.
* Likewise, a car headlight restoration kit would require a photo of a uniformed, yellowed headlight in the “before” scenario and a clearly seeing bright headlight in the “after” one. If the two images are not contrasting enough, then the effect of the enhanced image will be equal to none. Such instances as the angle change, the lighting change, or finally the cropping of the image in a way that it highlights the difference can be smart options to take up.

In such cases, the creators of e-commerce mobile platforms must take extra care to build satisfactory transformations. A shopper uses their mobile device for inquiring and once they find what they are looking for, she or he instantly moves on to browse other items. 

The devices differ significantly in size and resolution; therefore to guarantee the overview finishes fruitful one should see the image sizes supplied in the mockups with.

If the users are to trust the product, the changes should be shown visibly as in normal circumstances; For example, a kind of wrinkle remover should clearly reveal the difference between being untouched and treated. It is the only way to ensure that customers are aware of the improvement.

Optimized before-and-after shots give a significant lift in click-through and [conversion rates](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/7-tips-to-increase-amazon-conversion-rate-2022/) on Amazon. They would be inclined to try the product if they immediately recognized the difference with no hassle. This fact orders customer beliefs about product effectiveness and their actions of purchase. 

* For example, creators can use the above case. Just like normal people, these objects look different when they are in other places due to a lack of recognition. The maturation machines are repeated after such phases. A sample of before and after putting it on very dry skin showed it healing. The product should not be assumed to promote huge miraculous changes in the users that look not at all ordinary. 

Rather, it should look like it’s for women who had not sun-tanned. And such an easy job becomes difficult for them to believe. Because of that, they will not use it. If the user is afraid of being straight then she/he decides to purchase a product that facilitates this task. 

The only way to give her safety is to show her “Here I am, a girdle. Therefore, let someone see this ugly chair.” The message is unclear. And psychological factors are at play.

# Limit Over-Editing or Misleading Enhancements

Manipulating photos by correcting colors or cropping is standard procedure. Continuing with excessive manipulation can lead to disbelief. 

When customers feel that before-and-after photos are excessively altered, they immediately get suspicious and reject the product. This is the main reason they would not buy such a product. 

For customers, genuine representation is most important, and anything that implies digital alteration can result in doubts about the product’s reliability.

* To illustrate, the ideal image of a stretch mark removal cream must clearly display the way the stretch marks become lighter than before, rather than removing them completely through Photoshop. Too perfect transformations would make people think that the results are not true but rather artificial and not really achieved by the product. More of a realistic strategy is when stretch marks are less noticeable but are not totally gone and thus are more trustworthy.
* For instance, a teeth-whitening product that brightens the “after” image to an unnatural level can create the perception of manipulation. Instead, keeping the lighting and exposure levels of both images consistent so it appears real is possible.

Amazon’s rules are very strict about posting a fake image of a product and over-altering images can cause compliance problems. If customers feel misled, they can report the listing or write a bad review that deteriorates the brand’s credibility.

Utilizing images taken by actual customers can also help mitigate doubt. If real users post pictures of their results that are not changed, the authenticity ensures potential buyers. Having a disclaimer like “Results vary according to individual usage” also assists in managing expectations while retaining transparency.

By ensuring the representation of real life through [before and after](https://medium.com/@rochelle.ellul/before-and-after-c2f8119ebf29) images, customers will build trust and see the product’s claims as the truth. When transformations are represented truthfully, customers tend to be assured and make purchases confidently.

# Use Split-Screen Images for Direct Comparisons

The split-screen image layout combines before and after images into one easy-to-view format that has more impact.

 Instead of asking customers to scroll through two separate images, the split-screen format presents the “before” and “after” comparative states together, thereby making the comparison immediate and effective because of its visibility.

* For instance, a shoe cleaning product displays one half of the sneaker with dirt and the other part untouched. With this technique, viewers easily recognize the transformation while their focus is not diverted.
* A similar thing can be achieved for the cleaning spray brand by choosing a greasy stove top on the left and a clean, shiny cooking surface on the right. This way of comparison is visually simple, and makes the product’s cleaning power clear.

Split-screen images have a unique connectivity for mobile shoppers, hence, easy comparison is possible without the need for several clicks or extensive zooming.

 Customers are not only more likely to be inclined toward the product when they can see the change instantly but they will also tend to be more convinced by the product’s effectiveness.

# Use Clear and High-Quality Images for Instant Recognition

The image quality is what either hinders or helps a shopper notice a product’s transformation process. Vague, pixelated, or poorly lit images do not hold attention, thus making communication of the intended message difficult. 

Sharp and clear images help to ensure the buyer’s attention is captured at its fullest as the contrast of “before” and “after” is straightforward enough to see even if we are scrolling through the listing fairly fast.

* Consider, for example, the functionality of an acne treatment serum being sold by a brand in the online marketplace. It should be guaranteed that the images show and are representative of the color, texture, and impurities of the skin before and after treatment. 
* In case the customer’s skin in the “before” image was blurry while the “after” image was sharp, it is likely to cope with their doubts that the transformation is real. Professional photography is indeed important in this regard. An improvement in the results of before-and-after photos is guaranteed by using the right high-resolution camera, light, and a plain background.

Mobile shoppers require images that are much more detailed and perfect for lighting in order to distinguish those small changes. Numerous people shop on their phones on Amazon, so it is easy to miss an unclear before-and-after comparison, which diminishes its effectiveness. 

The clarity of product images, in addition to engaging users, is also instrumental in demonstrating a user’s product trust. 

* Having the right light settings helps in showing the subtle difference like hair color or night cream, for example, which ensures the transformation is evident and customers don’t have to zoom or squint to see the change.

In addition, optimization of the file size guarantees that the images load rapidly without any loss of quality. Prospective buyers might leave the webpage before proceeding with the product, which will ultimately frustrate them when the images are gradually appearing. 

Amazon, however, states that images are best presented with a white background, as they are more visible and professional. Following these tips could largely increase the conversion rates since the customers will prefer the products that are visually powerful and show good quality.

It is also vital that [Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/whats-an-amazon-fnsku-how-to-create-an-fnsku-for-fba-sellers/) make sure their products are in alignment with the Amazon guidelines as misleading enhancements or over-editing are to be avoided.

 If the overly touched photos look suspicious customers will suspect them to be fake and eventually leave negative comments if the product does not match the experience they had. 

Rather than an overly edited product, the brand should take genuinely photographed before-and-after pictures and let the viewers be the judge of the effectiveness.

By allowing imagination to be king and that interesting stories that truly shine and draw people to their image are kind of captivating, excited talking to their images too, more are becoming the bestsellers in the world of Amazon. 

Good strategy like this should be effective on its own anyway, while its customers are doing the heavy lifting, giving it a stunning smile and spotting it on a shelf. This type of marketing builds trust and also generates engagement leading to sales and favorable customer reviews.

# Consistent Background and Angle for Authenticity are Crucial

When it comes to playing after the quality of the picture, it is one of the most critical factors. Any change in the background, the light or the angle of the camera, can be misleading and create doubts in the mind of the buyer about the women and eventually product but not by them. 

Using an identical background allowed buyers to believe in the change brought about by the product instead of showing them just the different angles of the pictures.

* For instance, the model of a teeth-whitening product, in both “before” and “after” images should have the same background, lighting due to conditions, and the subject being in the same position. If the “before” photo has to be shot in low light while the “after” photo, even in daylight, is very different; customers may think that this change is due to artificial light and not the product itself. 

This can lead to distrust and prevent conversions. An environment where one has control over the light conditions would remain the same to produce an image representing the product at its true effect.

* One of the most frequent blunders made by Amazon FBA sellers is employing different angles for the “after” image. In case the angle of a customer’s grin in the teeth-whitening kit “before” image is very different from that in the “after” photo, it might look designed to manipulate the transformation purposely. The customer can assess the transformation with the assurance that the angles are equal.
* A skincare brand, presenting a dark spot removal cream, should be the same in positioning the model when showcasing the product. If the model in the “before” and “after” images turns their face differently, the real effect may not be obvious; thus, the power of a visual comparison may be lost. 

Keeping the subject in the same pose makes it look more relevant and the change more believable. Consistency of the before-and-after images can be guaranteed through the use of a tripod and constant lighting equipment. 

Professional product photographers usually work in a controlled studio environment in which the lighting is always the same, thereby ensuring that the same conditions are assigned to each image round. 

When it comes to capturing images submitted by customers, sellers should include clear instructions on how to take identical background images and angles to ensure authenticity.

# Highlight the Transformation with Visual Cues

Successful before-and-after comparisons depend primarily on how easily shoppers can see the difference. Whereas some alterations can be readily detected, others need extra help to make sure that prospective customers see the variations.

 Including visual aids like arrows, outlines, labels, or contrast in colours directs the attention to the improvement made, reinforcing the impact of the transformation.

* For instance, a car scratch remover brand can use dashed outlines to highlight the scratched area in the “before” image while leaving the “after” image clean and without markings. This way, even the tiniest imperfections or scratches are visible which lets shoppers appreciate the effectiveness of the product. 

Without these pointers, subtle changes can be overlooked, and the image would lack uniqueness which would ultimately make it unpersuasive.

* Text labels can help the before and after images serve their purpose through the provision of context. A wrinkle-reducing serum can include an annotation such as “Before: Notable Wrinkles” and “After: Smoother Skin in 4 Weeks.” 

Such markers serve to buttress the desired effect making it easy enough for casual shoppers to get the transformation at first sight rather than through reading long product descriptions.

 Additionally, these indicators also minimize any confusion from potential customers misinterpreting what was changed in the photograph since they would accurately pin down information from the labels.

* Another [way Amazon FBA sellers](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/5-ways-to-step-up-your-game-as-an-amazon-seller-this-2023/) can depict transformation is by applying split-screen effects strategically. Online retailers may opt for an operator-controlled swipe process on the website where a whole vertical line divides the two parts with one of them retaining its original state while the other side displays an improved model where necessary changes have been made.

 This technique is especially useful for items like wood polish that require a photograph showing both a neglected side and the newly polished side side by side.

I'm currently using the Peak Design everyday messenger sling bag. I like the build quality and clever features but: I'm kinda tired of the form factor and it gets kinda awkward if I I need to carry something 'chunky' of something that's thick. I really dig the brand so I've been looking into their everyday backpack and backpack zip, but I am willing to buy any good quality brand
I live in Argentina, so it's kinda hard to get access to every brand, but friends regularly travel to the US and Europe, so they could buy it for me

It doesn’t make a person weak at all) nobody knows what anyone truly goes through behind closed doors. 

Just someone who’s laid back, caring, respectful, very trustworthy, kind, thoughtful, understanding, genuine, self aware, humble & down to earth (because that’s what I bring to the table) 

I don’t like drama, I don’t like gossip, I just want positive vibes (unless ur going through a hard time, I can be a shoulder to lean on, listen and give advice (if it’s wanted) cuz i go through my own personal struggles and understand how it gets). 

I don’t want someone who’s self absorbed, thinks their opinions and views are always correct and everyone else is always wrong. It shouldn’t matter, that’s your views and I have mine and that should be fine.

From the taker of copious \\\*Stupid little walks for my stupid mental health\\\*, I bring you this silly little post for my silly mental health. Available right now, on a phone in front of your face.

I’ve done a fair bit of thinking over the past months, and I realised I’ve mostly been living life on autopilot. Get up, work late, cook, eat, read or game, and repeat. When family or coworkers ask me what I’ve been up to, I don't really have anything to share.  I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely.

I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!

You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again.

I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

As a professional skeptic (and part-time overthinker), I figured, why not test how bad it can be?

Turns out, it’s actually pretty impressive.

I asked it to build a personal task manager — user accounts, reminders, basic UI, nothing crazy.

Instead of spitting out a random template, it asked smart questions like:

""Should users get deadline notifications?""

""Mobile-first or desktop?""

""Do you want authentication, or do you trust the internet way more than you should?""

By the end of the chat, it generated a real app skeleton. Not just lorem ipsum nonsense — a legit starting point I could actually deploy, customize, and expand.

Quick facts they don't really scream at you from the home page:

Free accounts get 5 credits every 24 hours (each credit = 1 feature you generate).

Paid plan is $25/month and gives you 100 credits daily (a lot if you’re feeling ambitious or just really indecisive).

No credit card needed just to poke around.

What I liked:

Super conversational, not robotic or painfully rigid.

Actually thinks a little before building, not just dumping code at you.

Good base to build on without crying yourself to sleep over setup.

What’s missing:

It’s not full-on AI magic. If you want fancy stuff, you'll still have to get your hands dirty.

UI design options could use a glow-up. Right now, it’s more IKEA starter kit than Apple showroom.

Bottom line:

If you want to throw an idea at an AI and see it turn into something real (without selling your soul or your free time), it's honestly a pretty cool tool.

Yes, it's an affiliate link. No, you don’t have to use it. (But if you do, you’re not just trying a fun tool — you’re also helping fund my completely reckless coffee consumption habits. Everyone wins.)",2,1745663850.0,GrowthHacking,0,1.0,False

I walked with my wife and kids and stopped for a quick coffee. While inside, I noticed a lady who looked like a Christian sect activist: She was approaching guys outside, showing them some books - you know the type. Clearly, she had seen us inside and waited for us for 5-7 mins. When we walked out through the doors, she fell to her knees, blocking our way forward, and tried to kiss my daughter's foot. We drove her away, everyone is fine, and nothing happened. But now I wonder - what was that?

* A simple explanation would be that she is just crazy, my kids look like angels, and she really wanted just to kiss a baby's sneaker. But I don't buy it because I would not expect these kinds of people to wait outside.
* I could assume that someone else was stealing from us while she had our attention, but there was no one in the cafe except us and the barista I knew.
* She might have expected that I would kick and hurt her so she could demand some compensation afterwards. Well, I didn't. 
* Or maybe I am missing something.

So, what do you guys think? Has anyone experienced something like this?

This may get a little long and be a little over the place. For context, growing up my mom worked and my dad was home. My dad was very strict and very hard to please. He was that parent if I brought home a “B” it was “well why wasn’t it an A.” My dad has put me on a pedestal I will never ever reach and it has taken a huge toll on me. My entire life I’ve never felt enough or anything I did was enough. Fast forward to me turning 14, my brother joined the military and my parents turned all their attention onto me. Like even more so, that it drove me to an addiction. At 15 years old I started drinking and popping pills and this soon turned into an every day thing trying to get out of my body. I was sexually assaulted when I was 16, my parents went through my phone and seen some messages between me and friend. Instead of asking what happened my dad assumed I gave it up willingly, threw a coffee cup into a wall, smacked me across the face and screamed only whores without fathers sleep around. Trauma trauma. When I was 22 I started doing fentanyl and it was a matter or days before I felt like I would enter down the path or no return. I checked myself into rehab because I knew I needed to be better than that. In rehab we focused a lot of the trauma with my father, my therapist told me to speak with him. When I told this man how I felt his exact words were “I will never change myself for you,” okay in that moment I had to make a decision to either cut him out or accept and move on. I accepted and moved on. Our relationship hasn’t been the greatest but it is what it is and I felt like I was decently close with my parents and could talk to them about stuff. As you can imagine my brother has not had it easy with my dad either and he decided to go no contact. He actually decided this around my wedding and he texted me the week before telling me he couldn’t come. My brother going no contact is killing my dad and it makes me sad. My dad though for some reason keeps grouping us together. Like talking about how we are not what he hoped for and he’s embarrassed and they failed as parents. My brother and I are both first gen college students, live on our own with our spouses, and ask no body for help. We both put ourselves through school with no help from our parents. But my dad feels the need to shit on our career choices and how he doesn’t understand why we think we can do what we do (we both work in mental health). My dad is a narcissist who cannot take accountability. Now let’s move ahead to the now issue. I graduate on Thursday and this is a moment I have been looking forward to my whole life. More so than my wedding. He had a stroke about a month ago and he’s just become even more negative. The comments about my brother and I not being what he hoped for and he’s embarrassed and stuff happened yesterday and I feel sad. I normally would have cried and told my dad how what he said was fucked up but I tried to be reasonable and get out of there fast. I literally went to checkup on him to see how he was doing and he hits me with this, the day after I finish my classes. Now I’m sitting here, I can’t sleep and I don’t know if I want my parents at my graduation. This is something I worked my ass off for, working multiple jobs, having no life, so I can make something of myself. I’m worried his negativity will seep through my day and take my spark away.
