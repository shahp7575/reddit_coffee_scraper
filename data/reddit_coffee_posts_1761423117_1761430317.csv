1og42p5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaFSD/comments/1og42p5/an_aussies_experiences_after_first_week_of_fsd/,An Aussie's experiences after first week of FSD,"Hi all, I recently got FSD in Australia (we're currently on 13.2.9 here) and wanted to share my experiences and hopefully get some input from my FSD peers from across the pond. 

Just to give some context, my car is a 2024 Model 3 Highland (LR); cameras were calibrated a week ago on the day I got FSD, and I also got the service centre to conduct the optional 'precision cleaning' of the front camera enclosure just to be sure; at the same time, they confirmed that all cameras were 100% calibrated and fault-free. All drives so far have been conducted in clear weather at night or day, with the cameras being clean each time. 

**#Current Positives**

* Navigation in all road conditions (including dirt roads) has been faultless
* Acceleration and deceleration are seamless - I could probably rest a coffee on the dash without worries of it tipping
* Negotiation of emergent situations is excellent;
   * Navigating around cyclists, scooter users and at one point a cow
   * Dealing with vehicles pulling over, reversing out of driveways, motorcycles lane-splitting and so on
   * Slows down gracefully for smaller animals such as birds crossing the road in front of it
* Handles speedbumps perfectly
* Outside of the issues listed below, the system feels incredibly competent and assertive

**#Current Issues**

* In highway driving, after the car has overtaken someone, it will merge back into their lane about 2 car lengths ahead of them, whilst both vehicles are going 100kmh (62mph)
* Sometimes attempts to commit to unprotected turns at very poor times, which would have lead to oncoming traffic having to slow (at best)
* At roundabouts (traffic circles/rotaries), the car will often move to pull out in front of a vehicle which is oncoming and already in the roundabout
* The car doesn't appear to have context on upcoming navigation requirements; often sitting in a lane opposite to the side of the road that it needs to exit from, which then forces it to try and get across multiple lanes within 100m (often impossible in peak-hour traffic)
   * This is exacerbated by the fact that it seems to have a great deal of impatience, changing lanes constantly (on the occasions that it isn't itself going way too slow)
* The one instance where it's come to a pedestrian crossing, a lady was showing clear intent to cross with her pram/stroller, but the car was showing no sign of slowing down, forcing me to disengage just before it got to the point where I would have needed to slam the brakes on
* The car sometimes tries to go straight from a turn-only lane
* The car often has trouble keeping up to the speed limit, even when there is a substantial gap to the vehicle in front
   * This requires constant micromanagement with the accelerator, however after tapping the pedal, the car will reach the speed limit, then almost immediately begin to decay by 1km/h at a time, until it settles 10-20kmh below the posted speed limit

It's worth noting that FSD has only been available to the public for a month here, so we have yet to have a proper training run with ingested fleet data/interventions. 

In my opinion, if the above issues can be resolved, I will be happy to use the system for basically all of my drives - currently though, to my frustration, it handles a lot of situations extremely competently, and others downright dangerously.

My question to those in the US is, do the above issues mirror what you have experienced yourselves in V13? If so, were they solved in V14? I'm trying to gauge whether these issues are due to a lack of training data here, or whether they are inherent to the current model as it stands. We are well and truly in uncharted territory with FSD in Australia at the moment. 

Apologies for the long post, but there was a lot to unpack‚úåÔ∏è

1og42k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1og42k9/how_can_i_deal_with_the_frustration_of_being/,How can I deal with the frustration of being rejected?,"I am a 28 year old guy who is extremely romantically unsuccesful. I never had a girlfriend and I am still a virgin. Dating apps don't work for me at all. I didn't have a single like since more than two years now. I also asked out/confessed to quite a few girls that I like but I faced rejections each time. There were many times where I tought the girl I like was interested in me but whenver I confessed to her or made her understand that I like her, I got rejected.

At this point it is quite frustrating. I am so tired of meeting a girl, starting talking to her, thinking she is interested but whenever I think I will finally stop being a lonely dude, she tells me she is not interested or she is not ready for a relationship or any kind of excuse.

About a month ago, I met a 25 year old girl. She actually approached me and we met twice to have coffee together. She is a waitress and she offered me food at the restaurant where she works at. The last time we met (last Sunday), she told me very nice things which I tought were signals. She told me I have a very good looking face, she usually doesn't accept people in her life but she really felt a connection with me and was touching me.

I know I was probably stupid not to confess to her that I like her at that time but I tought I could do it next time. So I texted her on Thursday evening ""How are you?"" and she replied to me on Friday evening with something such as ""Good and you?"". Then I asked her if she was down to meet again and she still didn't answer my message. She changed her Whatsapp profile picture, was online all the time on Instagram and even posted a story on Instagram but didn't reply to me.

I feel quite upset that I tought I was so close to finally have a cute girlfriend but now I am brutally ghosted. I can surely consider this as a rejection. Should I totally forget about this girl or maybe text her again after a while? I am also sick of hearing things such as ""There are so many girls"", ""Plenty of fish in the sea"". I am just very tired of being so enthusiastic about a girl but then suddenly being ghosted/rejected. I feel very sad and tired at the moment. I hate this pattern. How can I deal with these feelings?",1,1761430026.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1og3zmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/1og3zmz/is_it_worth_the_risk/,Is it worth the risk?,"In Kampala‚Äôs vibrant streets, where boda-bodas weaved through bustling streets and neon lights flickered, Barry, a GIS officer, led a quiet life. In January 2023, he met Angellina, from a random WhatsApp group, a fashion designer with a small shop on Kampala Road. Still healing from a painful breakup she never shared with Barry, she poured her heart into crafting bold dresses for women in her close circle, friends, church ladies, neighbors. Their WhatsApp chats grew warm, her stories of fabric and faith pulling him in, but her guarded heart kept things slow. They met on one Independence Day, October 9, 2023, a Monday night, at a live band spot in Kololo, afrobeat and saxophones setting the mood. Her curly hair and cautious smile drew him in, but Angellina‚Äôs trust was fragile, and after that night, life pulled them apart. Barry‚Äôs projects and her shop‚Äôs demands. Silence hit until March 2024, when they reconnected, their bond growing over late-night whatsapp texts and calls. By February 2025, after another quiet spell, they rekindled; though Angellina‚Äôs unspoken past kept her reserved. Finally after a tearful opening up to Barry, he made up his mind ready to settle, Angellina became his haven, her gospel tunes and steady presence, his anchor.

A year ago, at a friend‚Äôs kwanjula in Kira, Barry met Rhoda, a young nurse at a modern Nakasero medical center. Her curvy body, chocolate skin complexion, sharp wit bold eyes, and trendy dress blending modern style with her youthful vibe caught his eye. They chatted briefly, her energy electric, but Barry, tied to Angellina, let it pass. Rhoda lingered on Instagram, her posts flipping from hospital shifts to Kampala‚Äôs trendy bars, tagged #LiveFree #YouOnlyLiveOnce.

At his lowest, scraping by in his tiny Kisaasi muzigo, Angellina became his anchor and close by friend who reminded thay things will eventually get better. As life moved on, Barry got lucky. A contract at a surveying, tech firm, with good pay, health insurance, and bonuses. He finally saw light and things started to fall into place. He finally moved to the ""rich neighborhood "" Namungongo in a 2 bedroom apartment.
As his work gained buzz and money lingered his pockets, Rhoda reappeared. One  very hot afternoon, she showed up at a tech symposium in Munyonyo, her nurse scrubs swapped for a chic outfit. *‚ÄúYou‚Äôre making waves, Barry,‚Äù* she said, her smile stirring something restless. Her WhatsApp texts started as casual, then flirty, hinting at coffee dates or late-night hangs with Kampala‚Äôs cool crowd. Instagram buzzed: Rhoda was back, her stories jumping from clinic life to rooftop lounges, tagged #ComeBack.

Barry‚Äôs heart was torn. Angellina was his everything; two years of patience, her dress sketches pinned in her shop, her humming as she sewed. Her quiet strength, even with her unspoken pain, made him want to protect her. He‚Äôd rather die than hurt her. But Rhoda, young and bold, slipped into his thoughts, her texts painting a wild life city lights, loud music, her by his side. Was it just a spark? Her messages grew vague, hinting at that kwanjula night, a moment he couldn‚Äôt recall. Was she after his success? His mind questioned!

On one of the stormy nights of October 2025, as rain pounded Kampala, Rhoda texted an address; a lively bar in Kabalagala. *‚ÄúOne drink, Barry. Let‚Äôs talk.‚Äù* In their Namugongo flat, Angellina slept, her latest dress,a gift for a friend draped under soft bedroom lights. Barry‚Äôs phone buzzed, Rhoda‚Äôs words pulling hard. A faint sound, Angellina‚Äôs soft breath, or his guilt? The city thrummed outside, rain blurring the streetlights. His fingers brushed his keys. Go, and he risked breaking Angellina‚Äôs fragile trust. Stay, and Rhoda‚Äôs shadow might linger. Heart pounding, Barry stood at the door, torn between the love he‚Äôd earned and a spark that could unravel it all. What waited in the rain?

She 31-33F and i never really chatted much over the past year of working together. Through a mutual female coworker, the three of us have been hanging out a little more often during work lunches or coffee outings.

Recently our mutual friend was out of office for a while. My coworker randomly asked me if i brought lunch one day and i said i did, but maybe id think about it and let her know. She the proceeded to invite a few others but they all declined. She messaged me again to circle back and asked if i wanted to join. So i went. A few days later i asked her to get coffee with me. She joined even though she had brought her own. A few days later i asked her out to lunch, she went with me even though she said she wasn‚Äôt getting anything. Just joined me to talk i guess

I got curious and snooped her socials. Not a single picture of her and another guy. The facebook relationship status said in a relationship since 2020 though which was a shocker.

I‚Äôd also like to say that one day we were talking about music and she told me she used to date a guy that listened to that music, but that was way back then. Not sure if that meant anything. 

Her bday was last week and she showed me pictures and stuff but no mention of a boyfriend.

Any opinions?

1og3rwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubers/comments/1og3rwz/how_youtube_autodubbing_almost_killed_my_channel/,How YouTube Auto-Dubbing Almost Killed My Channel (and How I Fixed That Mess),"Hey folks,  
old (and nearly bald) lurker here finally crawling out of the cave.  
Wanted to share my¬†*‚Äúwhat the hell did I just do‚Äù*¬†story ‚Äî maybe it saves someone a few brain cells.

So, I‚Äôve been making educational Shorts for a while.  
Nothing crazy, but decent: about¬†**$1‚Äì1.5k/month**¬†from ads and small brand deals.  
The problem: zero growth. Flat line. I figured my stuff translates well (pun fully intended), so‚Ä¶ time to go global, right?

Enter YouTube‚Äôs new¬†**auto-dubbing**¬†feature.  
Looked like a godsend.  
‚ÄúInstant multilingual reach without effort.‚Äù  
Right?  
Wrong. üòÇ

\--------------------

First upload went fine. Second one ‚Äî quoting people's comments:

>‚ÄúThis sounds fake AF.‚Äù  
‚ÄúCan you turn off this robot voice?‚Äù  
‚ÄúJust use subtitles, dude.‚Äù

By week three,¬†**watch time cratered**. Subs dropped.  
My ‚Äúexpansion‚Äù actually¬†*shrunk*¬†my channel.  
While I was¬†*still paying for ads*.  
So yeah ‚Äî panic mode engaged.

\--------------------

Switched to paid tools (figured HeyGen was best at that time).  
Voices were better, but:

* Still off
* Too pricey
* Added 4+ hours/day of manual fixes

Ok, I can understand ""pricey"" if quality worth it. But it doesn't!

Translating scripts, re-syncing audio, fighting timing issues ‚Äî it became a second job, thank you very much. My hobby channel basically turned¬†**a chore**.  
And the creative side? Gone.  
Videos got repetitive, energy dropped, and I started hating the thing I actually enjoyed.

At some point, a friend hit me with the line:

>‚ÄúEither fix it or stop whining and enjoy your plateau.‚Äù

Fair enough.

# The ""screw it, I‚Äôll do it myself"" phase

Armed with¬†ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok¬†as my questionable life coaches,  
I went full goblin mode.  
Weeks of debugging, coffee IVs, and way too many late-night Huggingface experiments later ‚Äî I had something that actually worked.

Here's the breakdown of what¬†*finally*¬†didn‚Äôt explode and what can do you, too:

* **Translation & Dubbing:**¬†
   * **OpenAI Whisper**¬†for transcription for speech-to-text/transcription
   * ElevenLabs¬†(or similar) for voice cloning ‚Äî trained it on¬†*my own voice*, so it actually sounded like‚Ä¶ me.
   * No YouTube‚Äôs auto-dubbing ‚Äî generic as hell.
   * Machine translators (Google Translate etc.) are trash for this. They butcher idioms and tone. Only use AI for translation!
* **Diarization is the king**: If you‚Äôve got more than one speaker, you‚Äôre in for pain. One of the biggest challenges. It's not a problem to clone voice or even post-prod it later. But when you want automated pipeline and near-perfect result, you need to BE SURE you preserve identity of your speakers right.
* **Lip-Sync Magic:**¬†with a help of kind soul, genius AI magician and just a good guy from Huggingface community, I've got customly tuned to perfection model built on top of Wav2Lip ‚Äì for syncing lips to the new audio. Key insight was pairing visual speaker detection with audio diarization, so if you have two or more guys in a shot, you detect right speaker to move his lips properly.
* **Automation:**¬†Wrote the workflow in Python + TypeScript. Will mention holy FFmpeg for pre- and post-processing ‚Äì just out of respect, F. Added a self-healing check: if sync drifts or audio glitches ‚Äî it reprocesses automatically. I can basically drop in a video and walk away.
* **Workflow now:**¬†
   1. Drop final video
   2. Wait \~40 minutes
   3. Get dubbed versions (Spanish + Portuguese for now). Manual work: \~20 min/week max

Pro tip: chose Spanish & Portuguese audiences for a reason, they engage¬†*way*¬†more than expected, even if smaller overall. Way less competition definitely plays its role.

# Results:

* Views up \~35% globally
* No ‚Äúrobot voice‚Äù comments anymore :)
* I actually have time to create again
* Burnout ‚Üí gone

# Stuff I learned the hard way:

* Don‚Äôt scale before you automate.
* Test dubbing on throwaway videos first (best ‚Äì smaller channel).
* Lip-sync is not optional ‚Äî even good voices feel weird without it.

So yeah.  
YouTube‚Äôs auto-dubbing nearly tanked my channel, but building a custom AI pipeline actually revived it.  
Took months, some gray hair, and mild insanity ‚Äî but worth it.

Anyone else tried auto-dubbing or gone international on a tight budget?  
Would love to exchange notes on scaling  
(If there‚Äôs interest, I can share more ideas about setup logic and where to direct with this ‚Äî no code dumps here tho.)

**TL;DR:**  
YouTube auto-dubbing = channel death.  
Paid tools = pricey time-sink.  
DIY dubbing + lip-sync pipeline = sanity restored, growth back.",9,1761429243.0,youtubers,0,1.0,False

We finally decided to meet up for coffee, and I was way more nervous than I wanted to admit. I showed up early (because apparently I like suffering) and decided to order a drink while I waited.

That‚Äôs when the chaos began.

As soon as I got my latte, I somehow managed to spill half of it all over the counter. The barista looked at me like I‚Äôd just committed a crime. And right on cue, he  walks in and catches the entire thing.

They just laughed and said, ‚ÄúMaking an entrance, huh?‚Äù which honestly saved me from evaporating on the spot.

We got new drinks, sat down, and ended up talking for hours. It was actually really fun ‚Äî once I stopped being a human anxiety attack. We never even made it to the movie we‚Äôd planned, just kept walking and talking until it got dark.

At the end, they said, ‚ÄúNext time, maybe try not to baptize the coffee shop.‚Äù So‚Ä¶ yeah, there‚Äôs gonna be a next time üòÖ

Person B: Hunter‚Ä¶Hunter Williams, sir‚Ä¶
 
Person A: So, can you go into detail about what happened?

Hunter: Y-...yes, sir‚Ä¶ December 9th, 2005.

The day is snowy, you can‚Äôt even see 5ft in front of you, the winter blows hard, and the trees are covered in the white blanket I often step on during long walks. It‚Äôs the type of weather that goes most well with tea or coffee, the type of harsh weather that goes to your ankles. It‚Äôs calm and peaceful, but the real reason i am out during this weather is for my hobby, call it weird, or even a little illegal, I often go out to abandoned malls, parks, or even houses to take pictures and hang out, it can be really fun, especially with a friend, you‚Äôll never know what you‚Äôll find, it‚Äôs like a treasure hunt in a way, especially if you find a really cool place, the place I found was cool, well at least it looked cool, with it‚Äôs white walls, and stairway that looked like it went on forever, I remember finding it strange that a small shack like building was just in the middle of the woods, it looks so out of place. Lucky for me, the door was unlocked when I first opened it, so I let curiosity take over and lead me downstairs. As I kept going down, the smell of a hospital and something rotting kept getting stronger, but for whatever dumb reason, I convinced myself to keep going. Then, that's when I heard someone scream for help, so naturally I went to the noise. As I walked, I could see mess after mess, paper and documents scattered, spilled chemicals, lots of rooms with no one inside, just mess after mess, and the smell of a very thick odor of sweet and metallic smell with a pork or beef-like scent, it smelled terrible, the smell almost made me vomit, but I kept going, I don‚Äôt even know why I did, It just felt like I was being forced in, step by step, I felt like a magnet being pulled in with another magnet, after passing some empty rooms, I started getting closer to the noise, but the more closer I got, the more blood I saw, there was so much of it, so many bodies, until I got to the noise. The first thing I saw was a burnt corpse; everyone in the room was dead, and yet, the screaming still continued. I looked everywhere for the screaming women, and yet, the noise just followed. I was scared to check behind me. Of course I was. I didn‚Äôt want to see what had been screaming behind me, screaming for my attention, but after a while I began to think it was all just a nightmare, I mean, who would think they would just randomly stumble upon a massicer, so I looked behind me, hoping what ever I saw would wake me up, but I didnt, instead, I saw, a thing, it didnt look fully human, it looked like its skin was to small and tight for its long, skinny body, it‚Äôs jow looked broken and long, and it‚Äôs eyes were big and bulging looked as if they were popping out to see me, it had no eye color, just black diolated pupils, with a permint smile like a dog happy to see me. Its pale white body matched perfectly with its dull white crooked teeth. I couldn't move at this moment, and after a while of me looking at it, it stopped mimicking a woman's screams of terrar, and just started opening and closing its mouth loudly, then grinding its long, misshapen teeth, I was so scared i didnt notice it walking up to me, slowly, before it grabbed onto my arm and held it with both hands like it was corn on the cob, before slowly bitting down, the pain was unbearable, it was eating my arm like it was corn, it even ate the bone, by the time was done eating my arm, it started licking its sharp spider leg like fingers, finally my brain snapped out of the shock and fear, and all I could think to do was run, but as soon as I started, it chased, as it mimicked the sound of a the laughing sound track you would hear from a old commity show, as if this is some sort of entertainment to it, as if my pain and fear is funny part in a game show as i run for my life, my legs are in pain, it hurts so fucking much, i just want this to end already, it kept chaising, even as i made it into the woods, but it finally stopped as i got to an ally way, as the edrenillen wor off, I passed out duo to blood loss, when i woke up I was in the hospital, I guess someone must have found me not too long ago and called the cops or something, but honestly, I wished they would have just left be, because that thing, what ever the FUCK that thing is‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs still following me, no matter where i go, it finds somewhere to hide, I see it outside my house, EVERYWHERE I go, it stalks, just waiting for me to be alone so it can finash eating me, I can hear it at night, i can hears it‚Äôs stomach growling always, as if trying to guilt me for running away, for ruining its fun, mocking me. It won't stop, it just chooses one person at a time, playing with its victims like toys‚Ä¶ No‚Ä¶ no no no no no no no! Why is it here when I'm with someone else!

Person A: Who is here, Hunter? No one is here with us, there is n-

As the detective begins to try and calm Hunter down, it bites off their head, blood spraying everywhere in the room, as it slowly chewed on the head as it made eye contact with Hunter, it knows he has nowhere to run this time.

We haven‚Äôt spoken to each other for more than a decade now, and yet I still yearn for you.  Sometimes, I wonder if you think about me. That yearning keeps me up late at night from time-to-time it hurts knowing you‚Äôre living your best life without me being part in your circle. We knew each other since high school, but it wasn‚Äôt until in college when we became friends, I don‚Äôt if you ever felt the same way, but I treated you as my best friend. Eventually, I developed a fond feeling for you, I didn‚Äôt understand it at first, but whenever you were there it made me happy just to be next to you. I hate myself knowing I still have love for you after all these years, even if you betrayed me a long time ago. I cut you off instantly, made it seem as if I was cold, but deep down I was just so confused with my emotions, the hurt stung badly I couldn‚Äôt function. Before I knew it, that hate that I pent up inside, was love all along, I loved deeply, and it was already too late. Eventually we grew apart, moved in different directions in life, made new friends, and yet the yearning was still here hiding somewhere in my mind. I‚Äôve come to the realization that I like boys just as much as girls, and I‚Äôve accepted that part of me. I never thought you‚Äôd be my ideal type, and yet you showed me that I could fall in love with a man. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt brave enough to tell you. This is trying to unburden myself. Tanggap ko yung pagka tao mo kahit gago ka (lol) I remember I saw you at a coffee shop three years ago, you were talking to your friend and I caught a glimpse of you. I walked out of there, but I knew you saw me. You were standing there looking at me. I felt you wanted to talk to me, pero di ko kaya. In truth, at that moment I wanted to hug you, but I just couldn‚Äôt. I just want you to know, I‚Äôm not angry anymore, I‚Äôm just hurt. I‚Äôm so proud of what you‚Äôve achieved in life, I‚Äôve always been an admirer from afar. I hope with this confession I can find more clarity. I don‚Äôt want to look back now. I want to have a fresh start in life. This is me finally letting go. There‚Äôs a world out there waiting for me to explore. Deserve ko rin maging masaya L.

It was barely 5 AM, but I'd been awake for an hour already, the words flowing from my fingertips as I revised my article pitch. This flat had become my sanctuary‚Äîfar from Portland, far from the Thompson house, far from Sarah's toxic presence. I stretched, feeling the pleasant ache in my shoulders from hunching over my laptop.

My phone buzzed with a text from Chloe.

*You actually awake at this ungodly hour or did you forget to sleep again?*

I smiled, typing back: *Creative genius never sleeps. Also, jet lag is my permanent state of being.*

*Ready to conquer Seattle next week? Literary world won't know what hit them.*

The Seattle Writers Conference. My first major speaking engagement. I glanced at the framed photo of Ethan and me by my bedside‚Äîhim with his arm protectively around my shoulders, both of us laughing at something long forgotten. Five years together, and he still looked at me like I was the miracle he'd discovered in a Portland playground when we were kids.

*Born ready,* I replied to Chloe. *Though I might need you to talk me down from a panic attack before my panel.*

*That's what best friends are for. Wine and pep talks on demand.*

I set my phone down, smiling. This life I'd built felt surreal sometimes‚Äîlike a dream I might wake from to find myself back in that house, with Sarah's footsteps approaching my door. But it was real. I was safe. I had Ethan, my career, friends like Chloe who knew nothing of the broken girl I used to be.

The day passed in a blur of productivity. By evening, I was curled on the sofa with a cup of tea, waiting for Ethan to call. He was in New York for meetings, but we'd planned to finalize our travel arrangements for Seattle. When his call was twenty minutes late, I frowned. Ethan was never late.

I dialed his number, but it went straight to voicemail. Unusual. I sent a quick text:

*Everything ok? Call when you can. Love you.*

Ten more minutes passed. My tea grew cold. The old anxiety‚Äîthe hypervigilance that never fully disappeared‚Äîbegan to crawl up my spine. Something wasn't right.

Then I remembered: Ethan had given me his backup phone password for emergencies. I could check his calendar, see if a meeting had run long.

I opened his account on my laptop, navigating to his messages to find his schedule. That's when I saw it‚Äîa thread of texts with a name I'd spent years trying to forget.

Sarah.

My fingers hovered over the keyboard, suddenly numb. This had to be a mistake. Ethan wouldn't‚Äîhe couldn't‚Äî

I clicked the thread, and my world collapsed.

*Thanks for coffee today. It means so much that you're willing to listen. ‚ù§Ô∏è*

*Of course. Small steps, Sarah. Maya will come around eventually.*

*You're the only one who understands how sorry I am. If only she would give me a chance...*

The timestamps stretched back months. Secret meetings. Plans. Heart emojis. Half-apologies that Ethan accepted on my behalf.

My tea cup slipped from my hand, shattering on the hardwood floor. I didn't move to clean it up. I couldn't breathe. The room spun as I scrolled through message after message, each one a fresh betrayal.

Ethan‚Äîmy protector, my safe harbor‚Äîhad been meeting with Sarah behind my back. The same Sarah who had made my childhood a living hell. The same Sarah who had destroyed my Stanford application and laughed while I cried. The same Sarah who had pushed me down the stairs and convinced our parents it was an accident.

And Ethan knew. He knew everything she had done to me.

Within an hour, I had packed a small bag and booked a red-eye flight to New York. My hands shook as I typed a simple message to Chloe: *Emergency. Going to NY. Will explain later.*

The seven-hour flight passed in a blur of rage and betrayal. Each minute that ticked by crystallized my fury. By the time we landed at JFK, I was no longer the calm, collected Maya who had boarded in London. I was someone else‚Äîsomeone with fire in her veins.

I grabbed my carry-on and stormed through the terminal, hailing the first taxi I saw.

""Manhattan. 52nd and Park,"" I told the driver, my voice steady despite the storm inside me. Ethan's office building. Where he would be working, oblivious to the fact that his carefully constructed betrayal was about to come crashing down around him.

Doesn‚Äôt seem like the hospital cared one tiny bit to match dietary needs based on the reason I was there after the first day. I was happy for that based on my appetite, but it may have done more harm than good.","Even with all this food, I lost over 10 pounds during my stay and I‚Äôm not a heavy person.

Technically day 1 I didn‚Äôt get food, I was waiting for a room for 7 hours and didn‚Äôt get settled until midnight.

I didn‚Äôt get day 1 breakfast or dinner‚Äôs photo. I was in bad shape at the time, but breakfast and dinner were pretty much the same as lunch, but different flavor broths.

Photo 1 - Day 1 lunch - chicken broth, strawberry and orange gelatin, lemon Italian ice (I had to drink this because it was left out so long before it got to me), and grape juice. I was on a clear liquid diet at this point. I made sure the receipt didn‚Äôt have important info displayed, but I got better on my photos and not showing receipts as the days went on. 2/10 (broth was cold, dessert was melted, and clear liquid diet is awful in general)

Photo 2 - Day 2 breakfast - turkey sausage, eggs, breakfast potatoes, ‚Äúoatmeal,‚Äù and fresh fruit. With milk and coffee. 1/10 mainly cause of that poor excuse for oatmeal. But also I wasn‚Äôt able to have coffee or too much dairy so the drinks were all a waste. The sausage was the redeeming quality.

Photo 3 - Day 2 lunch - tomato soup, grilled chicken sandwich, glazed carrots, fresh orange slices, and chips. Water to drink. 5/10, the chicken was super dry but was a welcome change to what I‚Äôd been served before, carrots were good, I couldn‚Äôt eat the orange cause it‚Äôs too acidic for my stomach.

Photo 4 - Day 2 dinner - braised beef over pasta, side salad, Mexican corn, and a dinner roll. Chocolate pudding parfait for dessert and iced tea to drink. 7/10 the braised beef was really tasty and I ate the salad even though I shouldn‚Äôt eat raw veggies. The pudding parfait was my favorite dessert I had while there.

Photo 5 - Day 3 breakfast - French toast, eggs, vanilla yogurt, apple slices, coffee, and milk. 6/10, the French toast was delicious and eggs were good, I ate the yogurt although I shouldn‚Äôt have cause of dairy and had to skip the coffee and milk again (I told them I wasn‚Äôt going to drink them but they kept bringing them)

Photo 6 - Day 3 lunch - I think grilled chicken marinara over pasta, broccoli, vegetable soup, and a banana. Water to drink. 3/10 the chicken was super dry and again, every food they served should not have been given to a patient with the reason I was there.

Photo 7 - Day 3 dinner - salmon, asparagus, home fries, dinner roll, and a side salad. Angels food cake for dessert with iced tea to drink. First protein they‚Äôve served that actually was good for my stomach sort of (it was still citrus-glazed, but I tolerated it okay) 8/10

Photo 8 - Day 4 breakfast - pork sausage patty, scrambled eggs, pancakes, oatmeal, and grapes. Grape juice to drink. I didn‚Äôt care at this point and ate whatever they put in front of me, whether or not it was good for my stomach. 8/10 the pancakes were so good, the oatmeal not so much

Photo 9 - Day 4 lunch - pepperoni pizza, French fries, and a sugar-free lemon lime soda. 9/10 so not good for me and probably did so much harm to my stomach, but the pizza was so good. They gave me pizza 3 times while there!

Photo 10 - Day 4 dinner - cheeseburger, side salad, tres leches cake, and Gatorade to drink. 7/10 burger was tasty and the cake was delicious

I used to believe I just lacked discipline I would start strong for a weekthen crash hard, eat everything in sight, and promise to try again on Monday. It wasn‚Äôt laziness it was my ADHD brain craving dopamine while I kept trying to diet like someone without it.



Here‚Äôs what finally helped me stop going in circles:



1. Make boredom the enemy, not yourself.  

When my workouts became boring I quit. So I stopped pretending I could do the same thing every day. Some days I walk, other days I dance, and sometimes I just clean while blasting music. The goal isn‚Äôt perfection it‚Äôs keeping my brain engaged enough to show up again tomorrow



2. Use hyperfocus when it happens.  

When that rare wave of motivation hits, I use it as fuel.I cook in bulk, prepare meals, pack my gym clothes whatever future me will appreciate. The crash always comes, but if I build momentum during the high, the low feels less painful.



3Make bad habits annoying.  

I don‚Äôt keep junk food at home anymore. If I really want chips, I have to go out and buy them. That extra step is usually enough for my ADHD brain to lose interest.



4. Lower the bar but show up more often.  

Some days I only walk for ten minutes, and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not about huge effort; it‚Äôs about showing my brain that doing something matters. That tiny bit of trust I build each time starts to stick.



5. Reward yourself immediately.  

ADHD hates delayed results. So I started giving myself small rewards for minor wins: a good playlist, a fancy coffee, or new gym socks. My brain doesn‚Äôt care about someday goals it wants satisfaction now.



6. External structure helps me every time.  

Reminders, alarms, notes, and visible gym clothes all matter. It‚Äôs not childish to need cues ADHD doesn‚Äôt rely on memory; it operates on triggers.



7. Stop expecting perfect consistency.  

You‚Äôre going to slip up and start over again. That‚Äôs part of the pattern, not a sign of failure. Restarting is our form of consistency.



Once I stopped trying to act like everyone else, I finally started to make progress. Weight loss with ADHD isn‚Äôt about willpower. It‚Äôs about creating systems that actually work with how your brain functions.",3,1761428301.0,ADHDers,0,1.0,False
1og3ey8,https://i.redd.it/0gnpnsliubxf1.png,Everything you`ve might missed in Dispatch trailers!,"I\`ve compiled every scene from three main Dispatch trailers to see what is waiting for us in the coming weeks.

All scenes are from Official Reveal Trailer, Release Date Trailer, and Official Launch Trailer. I sorted it based on interconnectivity ‚Äì some scenes obviously are actually one scene that got cut in multiple pieces, others seem to be connected due to some additional context.

**Malevola vs Invisigal**

One big fight scene is present in almost every trailer ‚Äì and it‚Äôs a brawl between Malevola and Invisigal. Well, less of a brawl, and more of a puppy kicking ‚Äì Invisigal is clearly outmatched.

\- We see Malevola trip and fall in an alleyway because of a chain.

\- Next thing we know ‚Äì Invisigal is dodging Malevola\`s sword attacks like her life depends on it.

\- In one of Dispatch minigame shots we see Waterboy replaced Coup√© in the bottom right corner. More importantly, Robert has to help Sonar fight Invisigal, who tries to mess with his super hearing!

**Monday meeting**

We have a lot of snippets from what I presume to be Episode 3, where Robert introduces himself to Z-Team. It goes as well as you can expect.

\- Sonar in his Monster form screaming at Robert.

\- Prism launching herself across the table to threaten Punch Up with a knife.

\- Malevola is late to this meeting, as per tradition.

\- Robert throws a chair at Golem during briefing. Why?

\- Monday meeting isn't going great. The meeting room has been turned upside down. Phenomenaman is here to play Magic.

**Firestarter**

A lot of time in trailers is dedicated to long battle between Mecha Man in his suit and a superpowered person fully engulfed in flames. In Episode 1 we learned that, although Flambae can control fire, he can just as fast lose that control (and lose his hair due to said fire). This person is on the similar power level with Toxic. My suspicion that this Firestarter is not Flambae.

\- Mecha Man in his suit walks past police car blockade. We see a building destroyed by fire and a menacing silhouette. Mecha Man rushes in.

\- Mecha Man in his suit steps inside the destroyed building, engulfed in flames.

\- Someone with fire powers attacks Mecha Man in said building. Mecha Man has to use his boosters, laser cutter and a shield to fight this entity.

**Beef the office worker**

For whatever reason, Robert brings his adorable pet dog to the work. Work suffers due to the cuteness overload. It may also be a part of Episode 3, but I can‚Äôt be 100% sure.

\- Robert wakes up, gets dressed, and travels to his job. In the foyer we can see Beef running around.

\- Robert on a public transit or in an elevator with other Superheroes... and Beef!

\- Some kind of briefing. Robert in the centre, Blazer and Chase are besides him. Chase is holding our dearest Beef.

**Phenomenaman is depressed**

I like the idea that our #1 superhero is not a villain, just on the spectrum. And, for whatever reason, he isn‚Äôt doing very good.

\- Phenomenaman is laying down on someone's car. Car is crushed under him.

\- Phenomenaman starts a conversation with Robert in the showers. Our #1 Superhero have massive black circles under his eyes.

**Repairing the suit**

Robert with the help of Royd and some emotional support from other characters is fixing up his suit. Some scenes are in Robert\`s apartments, some ‚Äì probably at SDN. With how bare-bones his flat is ‚Äì I have no idea how to differentiate.

\- Robert and Royd looking at digital blueprints of Mecha Man's suit.

\- Invisigal makes some dirty jokes at Robert\`s expense while he and Royd are fixing the suit. 

**Training montage**

SDN has a gym in the basement. Heroes and former villains spend a lot of time here.

\- Robert is training.

\- Punch Up is also a regular here.

\- Flambae mocks Robert in the gym. Audio implies Flambae knows that Robert is Mecha Man.

\- Flambae demands from Robert to leave a bench press.

¬†\- Sometimes later, Flambae rushes towards Robert, possibly is getting ready for an attack.

**Shroud gang**

We have a little glimpse at a fight scene between at least one augmented Shroud Goon against Z-Team. They have actual teamwork!

\- Punch Up is sent through Malevola\`s portal to help Invisigal apprehend some punk with Shroud augmented arms.

\- Then Punch Up punches this punk in his stomach!

**The Red Ring**

We don‚Äôt have a lot of visuals, but Chase and Robert are talking about something or someone named The Red Ring. Sound dangerous.

\- Chase and Robert are talking about The Red Ring while inside Robert‚Äôs flat. Chase advices caution.

\- Blazer mentions The Red Ring (audio only)

¬†**Additional scenes**

I have no idea what is happening, so these are scenes without enough context going for it. Yet.

\- Z-Team is posing for a photo. Notice how Punch Up has a bandage over his arm, Flame lost a tooth, and Invisigal doesn't really want to be here. Something or someone, probably Golem, is moving in the reflection.

\- Robert sleeping on a plastic chair. Before going to sleep he read the book ""Outcome Over Output.'. This scene is almost definitely connected to \[Beef the office worker\] storyline.

\- Z-Team are in high spirits celebrating something in the office. Robert is not in high spirit.

\- Z-Team celebrates something in a bar. Robert meets snake- or dragon-like superpowered person. I think this is our Firestarter.

\- Prism is putting up a show!

\- Something is disturbing SDN network, so Robert is having a hard time at work.

\- Invisigal dodging lightning strikes in what looks like either a museum or a jewelry store.

\- Taxi are getting blown up!

\- Royd breaks through a barricade towards something with a worried look.

\- Blazer activates her powers, and her eyes glow!

\- Mecha Man suit is repaired and Robert takes it on a test drive flight!

\- Malevola shows us her middle finger.

\- Someone throws a coffee mug at Robert. What the f-

\- Powered-up Blazer beats the living crap out of armed people with. We see broken steel fence and a school bus. You can even catch a glimpse of Phenomenaman in the background.

**Altered scenes**

We can see a lot of altered choice bubbles in multiple trailers. For example, I have a feeling some scenes with Firestarter is actually scenes from a fight with Toxic, I just can‚Äôt prove it.

So take everything we saw in trailers with a peck of salt.

**My leading hypothesis**

My leading hypothesis is this: SDN is working with Shroud and are responsible from breaking out of prison. SDN is not a charity, they are selling subscriptions! And Shroud makes villains. Shroud makes them more dangerous. More dangerous villains - more fear, and more fear means more subscribers for SDN!",6,1761428298.0,DispatchAdHoc,2,1.0,False

The coffee itself isn't bad, and if there was any ass in it at any point during the manufacturing process, it was undetectable. Thank all that is good & holy for that. Unfortunately it only makes about 6 ounces per packet, and one box of 10 ""teabags"" of coffee is around $22 so I doubt I'd buy more of it. 60 ounces of coffee is barely enough for one typical morning, so the whole box would be gone in half a day. No thanks!

Still hilarious. I know some people I'd want to get this as a one-time gift for -- including my (adult) son. It's more than I'd spend for my own caffeine habit, but that's not a bad gift price as far as I'm concerned.

I used to believe I just lacked discipline I would start strong for a weekthen crash hard, eat everything in sight, and promise to try again on Monday. It wasn‚Äôt laziness it was my ADHD brain craving dopamine while I kept trying to diet like someone without it.



Here‚Äôs what finally helped me stop going in circles:



1. Make boredom the enemy, not yourself.  

When my workouts became boring I quit. So I stopped pretending I could do the same thing every day. Some days I walk, other days I dance, and sometimes I just clean while blasting music. The goal isn‚Äôt perfection it‚Äôs keeping my brain engaged enough to show up again tomorrow



2. Use hyperfocus when it happens.  

When that rare wave of motivation hits, I use it as fuel.I cook in bulk, prepare meals, pack my gym clothes whatever future me will appreciate. The crash always comes, but if I build momentum during the high, the low feels less painful.



3Make bad habits annoying.  

I don‚Äôt keep junk food at home anymore. If I really want chips, I have to go out and buy them. That extra step is usually enough for my ADHD brain to lose interest.



4. Lower the bar but show up more often.  

Some days I only walk for ten minutes, and that‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not about huge effort; it‚Äôs about showing my brain that doing something matters. That tiny bit of trust I build each time starts to stick.



5. Reward yourself immediately.  

ADHD hates delayed results. So I started giving myself small rewards for minor wins: a good playlist, a fancy coffee, or new gym socks. My brain doesn‚Äôt care about someday goals it wants satisfaction now.



6. External structure helps me every time.  

Reminders, alarms, notes, and visible gym clothes all matter. It‚Äôs not childish to need cues ADHD doesn‚Äôt rely on memory; it operates on triggers.



7. Stop expecting perfect consistency.  

You‚Äôre going to slip up and start over again. That‚Äôs part of the pattern, not a sign of failure. Restarting is our form of consistency.



Once I stopped trying to act like everyone else, I finally started to make progress. Weight loss with ADHD isn‚Äôt about willpower. It‚Äôs about creating systems that actually work with how your brain functions.",2,1761427933.0,ADHDUK,0,1.0,False

It feels like just yesterday but also a lifetime ago. I remember waking up that morning with my head on his chest, feeling dread and panic about the state of our relationship but also hopeful that maybe, just maybe the tide was finally turning then I looked up at him and could see something was wrong. I asked him, ‚Äúis something wrong?‚Äù He said ‚Äúyes‚Äù and paused, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been having an affair.‚Äù I went numb, I didn‚Äôt believe it honestly. I felt nothing, I just asked with who and then the flood gates opened. I could barely get my words out, I felt so unbelievably hurt, angry, confused, shocked, everything gone in an instant.

10 years together and our marriage‚Ä¶over just like that. I think back at all the tears, all the conversations, the utter agony and hell I was in for so long trying to make sense of things, trying to get answers, just consumed by it all. The bottomless pit of despair I couldn‚Äôt crawl out of. It felt like a hole had been ripped open in me and I couldn‚Äôt stop the bleeding; I couldn‚Äôt stop the pain and yet no one could see it but me. His betrayal has been the most painful thing I‚Äôve ever been through.

While time, as slow moving as it can be during moments like this, helped little by little I‚Äôm still struggling. I‚Äôm in so much pain, full of doubt, fear, confusion, anger, it‚Äôs all still there but I‚Äôm trying my best to fight through it. I still have so many feelings; it‚Äôs been so messy and chaotic over the last 12 months. I think there‚Äôs many things I could have done differently; I leaned on him way too much in the months following D-day. I didn‚Äôt want to reconcile, but I needed support, I needed him to witness the destruction, to help pick up the pieces of me. I was in a total free fall and I was desperately holding onto anything I could to survive, second by second sometimes.

We spent a lot of days together, crying and holding each other, he made some efforts and I wanted to believe they were sincere; I wanted to believe so badly that he was truly remorseful and willing to do whatever it takes to make things right especially after all the lies, secrets, betrayals, abuse, and all the trickle truth that damaged me so deeply. I begged him to stop; it made everything that much harder. I didn‚Äôt need perfection, I just needed to see consistency, humility, raw honesty and real effort. I needed him to follow through with the things he said but also the things I asked him for, to keep his word when he made promises to me but he kept falling short and every time another opportunity to build safety and trust faded away and we moved further apart.

I told him it was over, the marriage was dead when he told me about the affair and I never re-considered reconciliation or the divorce but I did want healing, clarity, some closure, anything to honor the 10 years we spent together. Yes, of course, there was a part of me that whispered ‚Äúwhat if he blew you away, what if he gave 110%, what if you started to see the man you always deserved, what?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if that would have been enough to reconsider reconciliation, but I know it would have meant something to me regardless because then I could see destroying me meant something, that he was genuinely remorseful and committed to repairing what he broke, my heart, me, and also a commitment to finally repair himself because that is the right thing to do, not just in hopes of winning me back, but because that is what you do when you‚Äôre truly sorry‚Ä¶you take accountability, responsibility and you change so you never hurt anyone ever again.

I wanted him to be a unicorn, I wanted the man I choose, the one I believed in, the man I spent 10 years with, that I married, that I had fallen in love with to make things right‚Ä¶even if we never got back together. I saw the good in him, I really did and it was painful to watch the mask slip over the years, to see the cracks form and him turn into someone else. I felt like I didn‚Äôt even know him the last few years of our relationship, but I kept holding on and I really believed he would rise to meet me, that he would grow up and do the work, that together we could be so strong, that we could do anything together.

It‚Äôs so hard to see someone you love so much, someone you can see is in pain and needs help to continue to choose to run. I know he‚Äôs struggling, I do believe there‚Äôs a war inside of him, but I also know that he keeps making choices to avoid the hard, grueling, awkward, lonely, boring, agonizing work that is needed for him to finally peace. I reached out after about 6 weeks NC when the divorce was final, I was struggling and felt a surge of confusion, panic, fear bubble up. It felt surreal and I felt like things were undone and I wanted to explore couple‚Äôs therapy for some structured clarity and closure because I wasn‚Äôt in a place for it mentally before and he had asked for so many months for CT and he said he whenever I was ready, but I don‚Äôt know now if that was ever real. He spent 9 or 10 months after D-day telling me he wanted healing, he wanted reconciliation, he wanted CT and then started to slip back into some old patterns.

I found out a few things that were quite devastating after I reached out, he recently started talking to someone new and then proceeded to lie and trickle truth me about it, only being honest after I kept pressing. It wasn‚Äôt jealously I felt or that he isn‚Äôt allowed to date, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs emotionally reckless for him to do so, it‚Äôs that he swore for so many months he wasn‚Äôt interested in dating or even entertaining anyone because he needed to finally be alone and do the work. It‚Äôs that he knows deep down, he‚Äôs not healthy or ready and doing it anyways. He also reached out to AP, for what? Who knows, she basically told him to F off and he said he felt alone and needed that but also doesn‚Äôt know what he would have done if she reacted differently. Again, he swore to me he‚Äôd never speak to her again and also that he never would want to and yet he did anyways. He‚Äôs also still okay with lying to me, even though he knows how much it hurts me. He‚Äôs also hanging out with an old friend who he knows is not good for him, he spent 10 months ignoring him and now back to business as usual. He is also not keeping up with SLAA, journaling, mediating, reading, everything is being pushed aside and that cold, defensive, angry man who is always the victim, I see he never actually left.

It's like crisis mode is over and he‚Äôs totally regressing (if any of the glimmers of hope and growth were even real) or that none of it was real or genuine and all his pleas, all his efforts were just about reliving his guilt, his need for comfort, and possibly a manipulation to try and get me to change my mind. I don‚Äôt know, but I know he‚Äôs once again (as he always has) choosing the path of least resistance, he always chooses his own comfort, avoidance, cheap dopamine hits, external validation, etc. than the courageous path of healing and growth. Why fight for me, our marriage, even himself when it is so much easier to stay the same, to continue to be toxic and abusive and find new supply to numb himself. I see so much of his true self now, it hurts to have been deceived for so long‚Ä¶my friends, my family, I thought so highly of him, we loved him so much and he has hurt all of us but especially me, his partner. He was supposed to love me, keep me safe, protect us and he didn‚Äôt.

He was always fragile; he was barely holding on but I think maybe, just maybe there were real opportunities for him to turn it around, to save us especially a few years ago when we had a real moment in our marriage for rebuilding and he choose to lie and keep hiding, to let it all continue to escalate then blame me for it. He still doesn‚Äôt get it or more so he doesn‚Äôt want to accept it, that he was the problem and that our marriage was destroyed because of him not me. That in order to really change, he needs more than just therapy, SLAA, these tools he‚Äôs collecting and that being ‚Äúsober‚Äù is not the same as ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù and that being self-aware is not the same as changing. That in order to full change his behavior, his character it takes so much more.

It‚Äôs disappointing, not because we never got to reconciliation but that he doesn‚Äôt care to fix himself after doing the most diabolical thing you could imagine to a partner. He destroyed me, but yet I have to rebuild myself. It‚Äôs not fair, just like any of the trauma inflicted on us, it‚Äôs not fair and it‚Äôs not my fault but I still have a choice with what I do with it. I can let this consume me, turn my heart cold, use it as an excuse to hurt others, to let it make me miserable and sad, or I can choose to do the work, to heal and grow, to learn and do better next time‚Ä¶for me. It took me a long time to get here, 12 months and I finally only now feel like I‚Äôm turning a corner. I‚Äôm still struggling, it still feels impossible some days, I know the journey ahead will not be easy and that I will continue to feel confused, sad, that I will miss him and our life together, that the grief isn‚Äôt leaving anytime soon, that I‚Äôm still processing, that I will still have urges and impulses to reach out, that there is still so much pain, tears, and work ahead of me but I will fight.

Reminders for myself and others going through this:

I can miss someone and still choose myself.

He is not safe for me and I deserve honesty, safety and love.

I release the need to be understood by him.

It‚Äôs not my job to save someone who keeps choosing self-destruction.

I did everything I could with the information I had at the time.

My worth is not a defined by his treatment of me.

It‚Äôs not a rejection of me; it‚Äôs a reflection of him.

I am not hard to love, I was with someone unequipped to love deeply.

Healing is not linear, it‚Äôs proof I am still alive and trying.

I don‚Äôt regret loving him, I regret not protecting myself from him.

This still hurts because I‚Äôm still healing, not because I‚Äôm failing.

It‚Äôs normal to feel this way, it‚Äôs not wrong or crazy. This is what trauma, loss, and love colliding feels like.

I am not broken, I am rewiring.

I‚Äôm allowed to grieve the version of him I wanted to exist.

It‚Äôs okay that I still want to reach out, I just don‚Äôt have to act on it.

I can hold both truths: I loved him deeply and he was not safe for me.

I‚Äôm allowed to grieve this relationship, even if it was unhealthy: this loss is still valid for me.

I am worthy, loveable, and whole; full stop.

I can get through these hard feelings and I can let these feelings move through me, as many times as they need to.

I can heal, I will heal.

I got most of these from ChatGPT, some on Pinterest, and a couple just reminders for myself.

In the early days, weeks, months it feels impossible. That is so real and valid. This is pain I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anyone, not even him. Betrayal trauma is real and it takes time to get out of the fog and stabilize. Please be patient with yourself. I am still struggling and giving myself grace every day, it‚Äôs really one foot in front of the other.

Fake it until you make it, some days or weeks all you have in you is tears and that‚Äôs okay. Let it all out, that‚Äôs part of this too. In those moments, where your strength shines through amidst the chaos, take care of yourself. Journal, meditate, sleep, shower, go for a walk, reach out to a loved one, go outside, go get a coffee, just keep trying and don‚Äôt give up on yourself. You are so much stronger than you know, I believe in you with my whole heart.

I plan to take a break from the subs for a bit, I hope to check back in a few months from now but I need to give myself some real time to focus on me now that I‚Äôm finally feeling more capable and, to my surprise and bewilderment, I survived the last 12 months.

I want to thank everyone who DM‚Äôd me, the people who commented on my posts, to everyone who offered support, that validated me, that gave their time and energy to help a stranger in need. Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart with tears streaming down my face, thank you so much. You have no idea what it‚Äôs meant to me, the lifeline you gave me in my darkest days, you made me feel less alone. You helped me. I am sending you all such a big hug, I am holding on tight and it feels weird but I love you and I see you and I thank you for seeing me. <3",5,1761427826.0,survivinginfidelity,3,0.86,False

1og37wm,https://i.redd.it/5c9i3c16tbxf1.jpeg,Cat Burns - autistic hero (reality TV post),"I am obsessed with this TV reality show called Traitors. I‚Äôll let Wikipedia describe it for anyone who isn‚Äôt familiar:

*‚ÄùTraitors is a social deduction game similar to Mafia or Werewolf, set in and among the grounds of Ardross Castle in Scotland. During the game, a small group of contestants secretly become the titular ""Traitors,"" and must work together to eliminate the other contestants to win a grand prize, while the remaining contestants become ""Faithful"" and are tasked to discover and banish the Traitors by voting them out to win the grand prize.‚Äù*

I love it because of the amount of (mainly) NT people on it who think they can tell someone‚Äôs intentions or find the liars through their incredible ability to read people. Spoilers - they can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs actually a game of social dynamics but so many people believe they have this special superpower to judge others. 

So, Cat (above) was picked to be a Traitor and she is SMASHING IT. But this week she was nearly found out when another contestant said that the fact she was napping in the day meant she was a traitor because their filming days run late. She didn‚Äôt blink and said, ‚ÄúI have ADHD and autism and being around you all is exhausting my social battery so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm tired‚Äù.

See, this is true. It‚Äôs also true that she is lying to people about being a faithful. But please explain to me how this turns into ‚Äúplaying the neurodiversity card‚Äù? Because I‚Äôm having to restrain myself from arguing with people making that exact comment on the Traitors subreddits. Same people who have been slagging Cat‚Äôs ‚Äúblank stare‚Äù off and saying shes a psychopath.

(Sidenote - if there is some sort of ND reward card, I didn‚Äôt get mine and I‚Äôd like one. Is it like the coffee shop, where you get a prize after 9 stamps? Is it one stamp per breakdown or‚Ä¶? )

The way I see it, if someone with autism/ADHD masks and then mentions it later, well, they must be liars. Look how normal they are. But if they talk about a very real experience, their experience is invalidated again with a comment like, ‚Äúwell, you‚Äôre playing the.X card‚Äù.

1og36lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Journalism/comments/1og36lx/am_i_on_the_wrong_path/,Am I on the wrong path?,"Hi all, first of all I want to say that I have always had positive experiences here and I thank you all in advance for your help.

Second of all, I have been trying to find my way into journalism for years and years and just feel like I am constantly missing the mark of even becoming a low grade journalist. I'll explain what I mean. I am interested in photjournalism but tend to get mixed up on how the process works. I apoligize for the longwinded rant coming ahead- I am really feeling out of options and have met with journalists in person and recieved some incredible advice, but nobody is going to take the time to teach me how to be the journalist I want to be, nor should they. So I am coming to crowd source any ideas, small or big, from people who have worked in the field.

In undergrad I stuggled greatly. I was in engineering for a bit, then journalism, and finally ending with a BA in Digital Media Production and a minor in Journalism. While I was studying journalism, I had a pretty rough professor who really drilled it into my head that I would never be anything if I couldn't get my grammer and AP style right, and that took a lot out of me and I felt like if I couldn't follow very strict guidelines I could never be a journalist to begin with. So I switched to digital media production and it helped me greatly, I've made some really fun stories and zines and photo essays over the years and done some wild interviews all on my own dime and volition and direction. I have linked an example of mine for you to see, as well as some miscellaneous social documentation and protest photos. The problem is I make these between minimum wage jobs, have to work long hours just to stay afloat, and have very little time, money or resources to make these stories anything more than quick work.

Another problem is they feel hollow- I don't want to work alone, I want to work with a team. However I have been deathly afraid that these zines and such are not fit for magazines, as my writing is often shallow and short. My ""articles"" never make it further than reddit or instagram or sharing to local friends because I feel no magazine will ever take them, and I don't even know how to submit them. I do not see this type of work in magazines or newspapers and I feel like any work they are looking for is sophistically more flushed out and proven true. The only source I have is ""the person in the interview told me so"" and that feels shallow.

Flash forward and now I am pursuing a masters degree in London (I am from the US). I was initially pursuing a photographic social documentation program that would end with a long form published photo book, but the school cut the funding to that program, fired my advisor and half of the department's full time teachers (this is Goldsmiths, UoL, fyi. Lots of info of the cuts online) and I didn't find out until my first day at school. My new advisor told me he was not a photographer, was not interested in politics, and only taught students how to conduct social research projects. He even said ""I'd be the first to tell you to do something other than photography"" because he simply didn't believe it as a medium of documentation.

I figured I'd already made the move, so I'd try to transfer to a different program for a semester and see if it was worth staying here. I transferred to a new program that compares art's placement in political happenings throughout history. I thought this could be a really good way for me to understand how to use my photography in political contexts, and I met with the two directors and we had some amazing chats, and I felt like they understood where I was wanting to take my work. I am five weeks in now, and honestly, I am wholly underwhelmed. We have only one lecture per week, we read a mainly theory such as Adorno, Walter Benjamin, but also texts relating nationalism, race, urbanization, and we have one seminar per week, and write one larger essay at the end of the unit. Some of the texts are improtant background for me but nothing talks of media, publication, or even how a piece of art is designed to be dleivered and percieved. When I pitched my thesis to my director, I was essentially told that photo essays are not allowed, as my photos have to be in someway shown in public, such as a physical display or art piece. I was a little shocked as we spoke of this before I applied to join their program, I believe my ability to communicate with the public comes from digital or print publications.

  
Anyways, I'm at the end of the line now. I have already spent quite a lot of money on this program and it does not feel right at all. The lack of basic instruction, assignments, or even guidelines of how to write our final papers / theses feels, quite simply, awful. I am covering local political events the same way I did at home, all by myself, and recieving no critique on how to finalize them, only this time I lack the film and editing labs I had access to previously. I am in London, for fuck's sake, it is a giant city full of incredible journalists and I feel I should be able to find a way to stick through this and make this whole massive journey worth it in some way, but I can't help but think the insane amount of money I am spending on this school program is in absolutely no way worth it. I want to reach out to journalists in my area for a coffee but I have zero idea how, and as I said up top, that is not formal education, and I can't expect these people to teach me how to be the journalist I want to be. Maybe I should've just gotten over my fears from undergrad and done a straight up masters of journalism, but it feels too late for that now.

Any and all advice is appreciated. I am just looking for anything- your story of how you got to be where you are, your thoughts on masters programs and academics, questions, absolutely rip me and my work and my entire thought process to shreds, whatever you want.

1og36d4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1og36d4,Uhuru-peaked in September!,"My challenge for 2025 was to summit the world‚Äôs tallest free-standing mountain and on September 17th, 2025, I stood at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and watched a stellar sunrise. The effort, preparation and investment I committed towards this adventure was realized that morning and I felt relieved, exhausted, inspired and immensely ecstatic.

After reading reviews on Trip Advisor and Reddit, I narrowed down my options to 3 locally owned and operated company. I reached out to them with my requirements and asked for quotes. I decided to move forward with Mar Tours as I found their quote to be reasonable and I felt comfortable partnering with them based our communications.

Now, let‚Äôs get into the deets!

üèîÔ∏èThe Trek
I wanted the 6-day Machame route. This route kicks off at Machame Gate with overnight stops at Machame Camp(day 1), Shira Cave Camp(day 2), Baranco Camp(day 3), Barafu Camp(day 4), which is base camp, and finally Mweka Camp(day 5) before exiting through Mweka Gate(day 6). It‚Äôs a spicy route that gets spicier all the way through summit night/morning. 

For comparison purposes, I‚Äôll rate the days using a chili pepper scale, 0(bell pepper) to 10(Pepper X). Day 1 was a 6.1. We hiked from Machame Gate(1800m) to Machame Camp(2835m), starting around 1 PM arriving just as the sun was setting. It was a gradual climb and I felt good at the end of it. 

We moved on to Shira Cave Camp(3750m) and most of the day was spent getting through the first-half of the segment, navigating up large rocks and narrow spaces which felt like climbing up stairs in a skyscraper. However, the second half was less intense and we completed it in about an hour, so I‚Äôll give day 2 a 6.8. 

The spice level picked up on Day 3 as we climbed high to Lava Tower Camp(4600m) and spent about 30 minutes acclimatizing to the altitude before descending to Baranco Camp(3900m) for the night. The higher altitude, steep ascend and subsequent descent made it a more challenging segment so I‚Äôll give it a 7.4 

On day 4, we made our way to Barafu Camp(4673m) and it was spicy immediately as we had to get over Barafu Wall. I did my best impression of a mountain goat and even gave the wall a kiss. There were some ups and downs before we arrived at Karanga Camp(3995) for a short break, followed by a steep ascend to Barafu Camp(4673m). I‚Äôll give it a 8.1 as it was a lengthy and exhaustive segment. 

Day 5 started on day 4. Woke up at 11 PM to throw on a few layers of clothes and have a snack before we set off for the summit at midnight. It was steep, arduous and unforgiving all the way up to Stella Point(5756m). I was progressing well until we surpassed 5400m, at which point I started to battle the reduced oxygen, cold and exhaustion. I fought through it, and with the support and encouragement from Sele, the chief guide, and Peter, the summit porter, we made arrived at Stella Point a little before 5:30 am and then pushed forward to Uhuru Peak, arriving around 6:30 am. That last bit was rough but exhaustion son turned to joy and ecstasy when I stood facing the sign. The iconic sign on Uhuru Peak. I took a moment to celebrate with Sele and Peter before taking in the spectacular views of the crater, glaciers and surrounding views. Can‚Äôt forget the obligatory picture with the summit sign. 

We began our descent soon after and that‚Äôs when the altitude sickness really struck. The quick change in elevation triggered a strong headache and I repeatedly lost grip or my footing on the way down, depleted energy levels likely a contributing factor as well. Sele is certified to administer oxygen and carries a tank with him. The oxygen helped me overcome Acute Mountain Sickness, and after a little snack and mango juice, I continued on. A few of the porters trekked up to meet us part way with snacks and drinks and to help carry some of the gear back down to camp. Every member of the team congratulated me and it just showed how much of a team effort it was to make it to the peak. 

ü§ùüèæThe Team
I worked with the owner, Job Baraka, to book my trek. I made a decision on the route and the number of days for the trek and provided him with what I wanted. He came with some options which I liked, as I wanted to book my own lodging after arriving so I could take a couple of days to acclimatize and tour a coffee farm before starting my trek. Job was responsive during the process and coordinated pick-up from the airport and drop-off at the lodge I booked. I wired him the deposit to book my trek in February 2025 and paid the remaining in USD cash in person the day after I arrived in Moshi. I also decided after arriving that I wanted to go on a safari after my trek and he recommended a company in Arusha. He was easy to work with and provided details for the trek early in the process. 

Sele, the chief guide, has been up and down the mountain since he was 16 and started as a porter. With almost 400 treks under his belt, he knows the mountain like the back of his hand. He made sure my health was top priority and checked my pulse and blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure, temperature, and asked about the state of my number 1s and number 2s. He was thorough with his checks and ran them daily until the night of summit. He made sure to set proper expectations throughout the trek. From day 1, he would brief me about the next phase of the route, what to expect, what to make note of and estimated duration so that I was in the know and could prepare. He also shared stories about the mountain during the trek or after lunch/dinner, made sure I had the opportunity to formally meet the team, and introduced me to colleagues and shared their stories. I learned a ton about Kilimanjaro, the people in the region and the Tanzanian culture. I count myself lucky to have been able to have him as my guide. 

The cook I had on my journey introduced himself to me as King George, and that was enough for me to know that this trek was not going to be boring. King George made enough food for two of me and Sele. I needed to stay fueled and I did my best to consume as much as I could, and when you don‚Äôt, the team makes sure to remind you. I enjoyed the soups, the hearty breakfasts, lunches and dinners during my trek. He introduced me to Ugali, which is a dough made from maize and a local staple, and it helped power me through to the summit. King George is larger than life personality and I‚Äôm glad I he was with me on the trek. 

Juma, Peter, Samueli, Nurueli, Philipo were the impressive porters who made sure camp was set up, broken down and transported. They were machines. I would leave camp with Sele and not too long after, they would catch up to us, pass us and have camp setup by the time we arrived. They were navigating the same route I was and making it look like a stroll in the park, while carrying heavy gear. They would also make trips out to rivers, some quite a distance away from camp, to collect water for boiling. Juma was the waiter. He made sure I was awake when I was supposed to be up, hydrated and ready for my medical checkups and meals. He made sure I was ready to go and on time. Peter was my summit porter and made sure I had my ginger water elixir on the night of summit and was my hype man. He encouraged me when I needed it and made a challenging experience fun in some ways.

üìãThe Package
I think the option I went with was good value. I was not looking for a comfortable experience but one that challenged me and took me out of my comfort zone. I also wanted to build my own itinerary, glad I was able to do that. I asked to join an open group. I was told I would be joining a group of 3 others a few days before I arrived however, on the day I was picked up, I learned that group had to reschedule their trek to the following week. 

üí™üèΩI was able to summit thanks to the help of my Rafikis. They were impressive and amusing. I made sure tip them well and also gave them some of my gear. Based on my experience with Mar Tours, I would recommend them for anyone interested in making it up to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.

so i got botox for my gastroparesis on the 14th of october. i asked my surgeon, who is really amazing and i like him a lot, which is surprising for a gi dr, and i asked when i would be able to know if it worked or not. he said results could be immediate or it could take up to two or three weeks to know if it didn‚Äôt work. i can‚Äôt eat anything. and by anything i mean ANYTHING. i am 100% fed through a gj tube (which keeps flipping but that‚Äôs another problem) and i was wondering if any of y‚Äôall had botox and were successful and when you knew. i‚Äôve tried to have some smooth foods and liquids to see if it would go through, tea sat in my stomach before i eventually had to drain it because i was so sick after like i kid you not 4 hours. coffee the same. yesterday i was so desperate to chew something and i was hopeful maybe the botox had worked since it had been over a week? silly me i guess. but i had a small bowl of roasted cubed squash and i chewed it really well and ate really slowly. After a bit I threw up the squash as well as experiencing pain like i never had before. It felt like i was being stabbed with a red hot knife in my stomach. I have had bones sawed and screwed into different positions and dislocate major joints weekly from other conditions and when i say this was some of the most severe pain i am not kidding. i couldn‚Äôt breathe. After about 5 hours of waiting hoping maybe some of it would digest i grabbed a syringe and drained my stomach completely and the pain slowly went away.

it doesn‚Äôt even have to be about the botox necessarily. if anyone has tips on navigating the hard times while feeling alone please respond. i‚Äôm feeling desperate for someone to understand what this diagnosis is like.

1og35kv,https://i.redd.it/565cfw2nsbxf1.jpeg,5 Ad Angles That Print for Health and Supplement Brands,"Most supplement ads sound exactly the same.
Pretty packaging. Science claims. A smiling model holding a bottle.

And yet they still don‚Äôt convert.

Because you‚Äôre not just selling capsules or powders.
You‚Äôre selling belief.

Belief that this thing will finally help someone feel like themselves again.

So let‚Äôs talk about five ad angles that consistently perform.
The ones that hit curiosity, awareness, and credibility all at once.
The ones that make people stop scrolling and start paying attention.

1Ô∏è‚É£ What if your daily habit is secretly hurting you

This one works because it flips something people think they know.
And nobody likes being wrong.

Example.
What if your morning coffee ritual is the reason you‚Äôre tired by noon.

That single question takes something familiar and turns it upside down.
Now they‚Äôre thinking.
They‚Äôre curious.
They‚Äôre suddenly aware there might be a hidden problem they never noticed.

You‚Äôre not blaming them. You‚Äôre helping them see something new.
That‚Äôs what sparks action.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Ancient ingredient, modern performance

People trust things that have stood the test of time.
If it‚Äôs been around for thousands of years, there‚Äôs a reason.

Example.
The 2,000-year-old adaptogen monks used for focus, now in capsule form.

It feels familiar and fresh at the same time.
Like something old finally meeting modern convenience.
That balance builds instant credibility.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The engine analogy

Most people don‚Äôt understand biology.
But they understand cars.

So when you say something like
Your body‚Äôs an engine, and you‚Äôre running on low-grade fuel
it clicks immediately.

Or
Imagine driving with the handbrake half on. That‚Äôs what poor circulation does to your energy.

That‚Äôs how you make the invisible visible.
You turn complex science into something people can feel.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Five signs your body‚Äôs running low on something

People love to self-diagnose.
They see ‚Äúfive signs‚Äù and can‚Äôt help but check if it‚Äôs them.

Example.
Five signs your body‚Äôs low on magnesium and it‚Äôs not just muscle cramps.

It‚Äôs educational and relatable.
You‚Äôre helping them connect dots they‚Äôve ignored for months.
By the time you introduce your product, it already feels like the obvious next step.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Why 90% of people still feel tired after trying other solutions

This angle works because it adds credibility without bashing anyone.
You‚Äôre not saying the alternatives are bad.
You‚Äôre saying they only solve part of the problem.

Example.
Why 90% of people still feel exhausted after drinking electrolyte drinks.

You explain the missing piece.
Maybe they fix hydration but not absorption.
Maybe they restore fluids but not minerals.

That kind of insight earns trust.
It makes you sound like the brand that actually understands what‚Äôs going on.

The truth about why these work

All five hit the same emotional chord.
They talk to how people think, not how brands sell.

They meet people where they are.
Skeptical. Frustrated. Hopeful. Curious.

They take something people already do or believe and gently reframe it.
That‚Äôs why they work.

Because no one wakes up wanting to buy supplements.
They wake up wanting to feel better.

Your job is to make them believe they finally can.

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your mittens and prepare for a showdown between the Edmonton Oilers, hockey‚Äôs answer to a loaded cannon, and the Seattle Kraken, a team that‚Äôs learned the hard way that ‚Äúhome ice advantage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always mean ‚Äúhome victory.‚Äù Let‚Äôs parse the numbers, digest the news, and serve up a prediction with a side of sarcasm.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Oilers Are the Golden Boyz

The Oilers (-166) are favored to win this clash like a defenceman is favored to avoid a cross-check. Their implied probability of victory? A tidy **62.4%**‚Äîthanks to a high-octane offense that‚Äôs scoring goals faster than a Zamboni can resurface the ice. Meanwhile, the Kraken (+140) have a **41.7%** implied chance, which is statistically plausible but about as likely as a penguin coaching the Stanley Cup Finals.

Key stats? The Oilers‚Äô **11-point Connor McDavid** is basically a cheat code, and their supporting cast (Nugent-Hopkins, Draisaitl, etc.) could run a coffee shop if they ever left the rink. On the other side, the Kraken‚Äôs **Jaden Schwartz** is nailing shots like he‚Äôs in a video game on ‚Äúeasy mode,‚Äù but his teammates are still figuring out how to pass the puck without it bouncing off their skates.

Goalie breakdown? Stuart Skinner for Edmonton has a **2.17 GAA** and a **2-2-1 record** this season. But here‚Äôs the kicker: His career vs. Seattle? **8-2** with a **2.92 GAA**. He‚Äôs basically a Seattle-specific superhero. The Kraken‚Äôs Joey Daccord, meanwhile, has a **3.49 GAA** and **.888 SV%** in his career against Edmonton‚Äînumbers soÊÉ® (yes, even in Chinese characters) that one wonders if he‚Äôs been cursed by a grumpy fisherman.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Confidence, and Circuses

As I read the words, they echoed in my mind.
She is perfect.

The bell above the door chimed the same way it always did. Same stale smell of beans and sugar. Same barista behind the counter. Mark, I think. The guy who always remembered my order, asked about my day, laughed at the dumb jokes I made. It was nice to see a friendly face. 

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù he said, smiling. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen you this early in a while.‚Äù

I forced a grin, slid a few crumpled bills across the counter. ‚ÄúYeah. Something like that.‚Äù

He wrote my name on the cup, like always. The pen scraped lightly against the cardboard. The sound piercing my ears as if I was hungover from emotions.

As he made his way over to the counter to hand me my coffee he slid the money back to me. 

‚ÄúThis one is on the house. Hopefully a nice start to a perfect day.‚Äù

That word. That god damn word. 

‚ÄúShe is PERFECT.‚Äù Those 3 words ringing in my head again.

I let out an uncomfortable laugh as I said ‚ÄúThanks, man.‚Äù

He slid the coffee over to me. My name on the cup in red marker. 

The handwriting, it looked familiar. I had seen this before. Was I just being delusional? I‚Äôm not sure. But I FELT like I had seen it before.

‚ÄúShe misses you, you know.‚Äù

I slowly began to look up.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour niece, I‚Äôm sure she misses you.‚Äù

What was happening? The news, he must have seen it on the news. The case was getting a lot of coverage over the last 24 hours. 


‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, clearing my throat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been rough on everyone.‚Äù

Mark nodded, still smiling that same easy smile. But something about his eyes didn‚Äôt match. They were focused, like he was studying me.

‚ÄúShe came in here with you that one time.‚Äù He said softly. ‚ÄúHot chocolate, extra whipped cream. Cute kid.‚Äù

My stomach tightened.

‚ÄúYou remember that?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. I remember everyone who walks through that door.‚Äù

‚ÄúListen, I should‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou left this here last time.‚Äù

Mark reached under the counter and slid a small paper sleeve toward me. A corner of glossy paper peeked out.

My chest tightened. I pulled it free just enough to see the image and everything inside me went still.

It was my niece‚Äôs school photo. The same one that hung on my sister‚Äôs fridge. The same one I kept in my wallet, behind my badge.

‚ÄúWhere did you get this?‚Äù

Mark smiled, kind and unbothered, like we were talking about the weather. ‚ÄúYour sister should really lock her windows.‚Äù

The coffee shop noise seemed to fade, replaced by a dull ringing in my ears. My hand drifted instinctively toward my holster.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúIf you pull that thing out, you‚Äôll never see her again.‚Äù

My throat went dry.

‚ÄúWhere is she?‚Äù I managed.

He leaned forward, elbows on the counter. His voice softened, almost pitying.
‚ÄúYou told me all about her. Her name. Her school. The way she scrunches her nose when she laughs. You even showed me this picture yourself.‚Äù

I tried to remember. I didn‚Äôt want to believe it but I could hear myself doing it. Talking too much over coffee. Filling silence with small talk.

He slid the photo closer. My name was written on the back in red ink.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs perfect‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúJust like you said.‚Äù

The bell over the door chimed behind me. Someone came in for their morning latte. I blinked and the photo was gone. Just my cup of coffee, cooling on the counter.

I looked to Mark. 
 

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want her to end up like the others,‚Äù he said, barely above a whisper, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll listen to exactly what I say.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt blink. He didn‚Äôt raise his voice. He just stood there, calm, like we were still two regulars talking about the weather.

My pulse was hammering so hard I thought everyone in the shop could hear it.
‚ÄúWhat did you do to her?‚Äù

Mark tilted his head slightly, almost disappointed.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the question you should be asking.‚Äù

A woman behind me laughed at something on her phone. The milk steamer hissed. Life went on, like the world didn‚Äôt notice what was happening right in front of them.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to go home‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to act normal. You‚Äôre not going to tell anyone about this conversation. Not your sister, not your detective friends. You‚Äôll hear from me when it‚Äôs time. If you do anything stupid, she‚Äôll end up like the others.‚Äù

He said it so simply, like it wasn‚Äôt a threat just a fact.

I stared at him, waiting for a tremor, a flinch, something. But he just smiled that same polite smile he gave every customer.

‚ÄúHave a good day, Officer.‚Äù

He turned toward the next person in line.
And just like that, I wasn‚Äôt a customer anymore. I was a hostage.

I walked out before he could say anything else. The bell over the door chimed behind me, the same cheerful sound I‚Äôd heard a hundred times before, but it felt different now, hollow, mocking.

The air outside hit cold against my face. Morning rush hour had started and people were crossing the street with their coffees, laughing, living in a world that hadn‚Äôt been flipped upside down.

Mine had.

I stood there on the sidewalk, gripping the cup he‚Äôd handed me. The cardboard was warm against my skin, but my hands were shaking. I kept telling myself to breathe, to think, to do something. Call the precinct. Call anyone.

But his words kept replaying in my head.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll listen to exactly what I say.‚Äù

It wasn‚Äôt the threat that scared me, it was the certainty. He said it like he‚Äôd already won.

I was always the odd one out in the family, vegetarian as a younger teenager and vegan at 18. I‚Äôm 32 now. They‚Äôd get upset if I ever spoke about why I was vegetarian or vegan. Then when my parents watched just the trailer of Earthlings they went veggie, and later following a veganuary went vegan. 

They‚Äôd became really passionate about it, and I did feel it brought us closer to share this. My mum suited veganism so much, she was the kindest person and it followed to be kind in her diet and lifestyle choices. She sadly passed away a few years ago.

My dad recently told me, quite emotionally, that he hadn‚Äôt been vegan anymore for a while (since around when my mum was in hospice care). I tried not to make him feel bad about it and told him only that I felt bad he felt he couldn‚Äôt tell me.


I‚Äôve just been to visit him for a weekend, and I couldn‚Äôt help but be upset seeing animal products in the cupboard and bacon in the fridge. It‚Äôs just so detached from how I thought I knew him - as someone that has happily been vegan and even seen health improvements from it. 

I am struggling to understand how you can go from 100 to 0 - when he told me, I sort of assumed he was still roughly trying to eat vegan when possible/convenient. But when we went to a coffee and I asked about if they had a hot chocolate that was vegan, he defiantly exclaimed ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter to me!‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm just struggling with how to deal with this and not become distant from my dad. I‚Äôm feeling guilty about feeling upset by it.

Just looking for advice on how I can move past this, or how to talk about it with him in the kindest way. ",5,1761427486.0,veganuk,6,0.78,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Penguins vs. Blue Jackets: A Frozen Frenzy of Favors and Fumbles**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a clash of the Metropolitans! The Pittsburgh Penguins (-120) host the Columbus Blue Jackets (+100) on October 25, 2025, in a game so stacked with history and injuries, it‚Äôs like a Russian nesting doll of chaos. Let‚Äôs unpack this with the precision of a Zamboni and the wit of a ref trying to explain a penalty.

---

### Parse the Odds: Penguins Have the Edge, But Is It Icy?

The Penguins are favored at -120, implying a 54.5% chance to win. For Columbus (+100), their implied probability is 50%‚Äîa statistical paradox that makes their +100 odds look almost generous. The over/under is 6.5 goals, with the under (-115) as the slight favorite. Why? Because both teams are bringing their ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not embarrass ourselves‚Äù approach to offense.

Pittsburgh‚Äôs historical dominance is enough to make Columbus‚Äôs coffee go cold. The Pens are 12-1-3 against the Blue Jackets in their last 16 meetings and 24-4-1 in Pittsburgh since 2000‚Äì01. That‚Äôs not just luck‚Äîit‚Äôs *legacy*. Columbus, meanwhile, is the only team in the Metropolitan Division with a .500 points percentage but the fewest points (6). They‚Äôre like a math student who aced the pop quiz but bombed the final exam.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries and a Hall of Fame Distraction

Pittsburgh‚Äôs injury report reads like a grocery list for a orthopedic convention: **Joel Blomqvist** (lower body), **Kevin Hayes** (upper body), and **Tanner Howe** (ACL) are out. Columbus loses **Miles Wood** (upper body), but their star? Well, they don‚Äôt have one quite like Evgeni Malkin.

Columbus‚Äôs recent 5-1 drubbing of the Stars? A bright spot, sure, but their upcoming schedule is a gauntlet. They‚Äôve got 15 back-to-back games this season‚Äîenough to make even the most caffeinated player question their life choices. Hosting the Caps and Penguins in quick succession? That‚Äôs like being asked to juggle flaming torches after a 12-hour shift.

For Pittsburgh, the night isn‚Äôt just about hockey.

***Get in, loser! We're reading an essay!***

1. **Letting a cat out of a window is not inherently dangerous.** The fact that people keep mentioning this like it was gonna die makes me wonder if some of you have ever been around cats, honestly. Yes, she did it because she was angry the cat scratched her. That does not mean she was hurting it, she just let it out the window (like it wanted to go) because Laura didn't want it to and she had just poured burning hot coffee on her skin. Now the cat's out of the bathroom and Laura's going to fret over it. Two mildly vengeful acts completed in one go, but not terrible.
2. **She did not simply ""steal"" Laura's bracelet.** She was f\*cking around in Laura's bedroom, trying on a scarf and jewelry and had to hide immediately when she heard her in  the house (which Daniel snuck her into). Yes, trying on someone's things is very rude- doesn't make it the same as stealing. Especially since she's desperate to put it back as soon as possible and they never show her wearing it (to my knowledge).
3. **She was not stalking her ex. And the wedding revenge does not make her evil.** Genuinely surprised that some agreed she was stalking, perhaps they just weren't paying attention. She literally hides when she sees him at the gym and his fiancee at the gallery. I believe she did stalk him in the past, but she seems obviously embarrassed of it and frantic to avoid him. For the revenge part- he leaned in her face and called her ""a roughed-up little chav"" (a wh\*re) after she said she was with someone way better than him. This girl came up rough and a punch in the face after that is not shocking. And yeah, a wedding is a once-in-a-lifetime event, but I feel if this were any other story we would all be rooting for her finding a way to embarrass him. I only felt bad for the wife.
4. **Every lie she tells is out of desperation for acceptance and her Mother has given her this fear.** Cherry is packing for a vacation that she's nervous for and her Mom laughs while saying that Cherry being herself is ""a terrible idea"". This is right after giving her a look and trying to convince her that people like Daniel will always ""stick with their own"". Cherry is proud of her self-made success but she is terrified that she will never be enough for Daniel's family. She tells very mild lies about knowing certain artists, her schooling, her Father's career, and the clothes she can afford- but every time the lies get more serious it's because of Laura making it exceedingly obvious that she does not like her. Daniel's already joked with Cherry that he's wrapped around his Mom's finger, so her lack of approval could mean the end of their relationship. Every step further in the severity of her manipulation is in the interest of either getting Laura to like her (e.g. pretending to drown) or angrily getting revenge for something terrible Laura has done (breaking a freaking glass on her own head). She was always going to tell the smaller lies because she felt insecure around his family, but I'm not certain the more serious ones would have happened if it wasn't for Laura's attitiude and exceptionally bad behavior.
5. **Her Mom, her Dad and her school years:**  Cherry's mom seems to love her, but for some reason Cherry has to make sure she won't go telling all of her secrets to a stranger she has an issue with (she doesn't say it's Daniel's mom). Like she's worried she'll take an opportunity to drag her down. Her Mom is so happy about how Daniel ""looks at her"", but the moment Laura comes around she has a list of terrible things to ruin it. And there's also the statements I mentioned in point 4. I'm not going to fault a 14/15 year old child for a violent act they did when they were hurt by someone who is obligated to love and care for them. And getting back at mean classmates and rude boys isn't something you should be judged for as an adult, either. She seems to have at least some shame when it comes to things she did in her past (shown by her desperately hiding from her ex, I believe), and based on how her Mom seems to hack at her confidence, she doesn't seem completely trustworthy when it comes to how she speaks of Cherry.

Now, onto Laura:

1. **The coffee incident :** From the moment Cherry walks in the room Laura zones in on Daniel's hand around her waist. The same thing happens when he has his hand on her knee while talking with his Dad. Then, she claims it's inappropriate to have sex on the day of meeting the parents and her husband has to remind her she did the exact same thing. Next thing you know she's *purposely* burning the girl's skin with hot coffee for ***literally no reason.*** This woman has a serious problem- not with Cherry herself- *but with witnessing Daniel's intimacy with her.* **There is no world where it is normal for a parent to be so upset with seeing their adult child act this way.** Losing a child is a hauntingly life-changing experience, but that doesn't excuse you becoming so entwined with them that you behave in this manner. Laura is terrified of Daniel leaving the nest, and (based on the jokes she made when he told her he met someone) every girl before Cherry has never been taken seriously by her; she knew they wouldn't last. But his chemistry with Cherry is on display non-stop and it's causing her distress.
2. **The lie:** Imagine this: your beloved child is in love with someone who keeps telling lies about themselves, stole your bracelet and put it back, punched someone and lied about the reason, and committed a bloody prank at a wedding. **Wouldn't you tell them all of this? At least the parts that you can prove?** Like the headmaster at St. Florian's saying she wasn't there? Or the money she pocketed for clothes? Why play an intricate game of cat and mouse if you have such a close relationship to your child? Why smile when she's around and die inside while trying to separate them if you're so bloody worried? *Because it is not simply about Daniel's safety.* It's about controlling him- even if Laura doesn't see it that way. Instead of sitting down and talking like an adult, she wants to puppeteer him into turning away from Cherry and clinging onto her. Yes, she tries after speaking with Cherry's ex and Daniel stays with her anyways, but what does she do next? She sees an oppurtunity in her child being hospitalized so she ***lies about him dying and ruins Cherry's career to keep him from her.*** That is absolutely *mad*. And no genuinely loving parent could so casually look their child in the eye while deceiving them to such a calibre as she did.
3. **The phone call with Cherry's Mom:** After their time in Spain, Cherry is obviously scared of what her Mom might say to Daniel or Laura and has no intention of introducing them. This looks very bad and seems to prove that she has a pattern of alarming behavior, but what does her Mom reveal to Laura? Cherry has a habit of seeking revenge when she feels wronged. From mean school mates to her own father, and she ends this by saying that if she doesn't get what she wants she'll get rid of you. Terrifying. So Laura sits him down and plays this recording, right? Oh no, of course not! It makes *much* more sense to drug him, right?! Because you *have* to drug someone to get them to listen to a recording that you could have sent to their phone!... Madness. That she would even drug him is so bizarre it's laughable, but I guess for someone who doesn't realize the underlying desperation for control they have over their child this would somehow make sense.

**Final Point:** Cherry's mother was wrong when she said that Cherry will get rid of you if she doesn't get what she wants- the truth is that if you hurt her she will hurt you back three-fold. I understand *very well* that Cherry has a destructive lust for revenge. And if I knew of her past with such a thing I likely wouldn't want her with my child either. But having an unrelenting passion for vengeance and being so emotionally bound to your child that you have a need to manipulate their life are two very different types of madness and it makes plenty of sense to empathize with the former. She may not be angelic, but up until Laura tricked her into grieving over someone she was going to spend the rest of her life with, her lies were almost ineffectual. And as for Laura, the moment she met Cherry she couldn't stand to watch Daniel around her, and it seems likely she would have searched for a way to separate them from that point on. I can't say the same for all the things Cherry did to Laura.",7,1761427297.0,TheGirlfriendTVShow,2,1.0,False

Original Statement given Janurary 11th 2014, Audio recording by Jonathan Sims, head archivist of the Magnus Institute, London. Statement begins.

Every day I just want to call in sick, to tell my boss that i have some kind of stomach problem and I simply cannot work today. Its a thought I'd had every day before this happened and id always stuffed it down. I knew my parents wouldn't like me skipping work, they always tell me i need to be doing something if I'm not going to college yet.

I have to drive to work at four in the morning on unpaved, snowy roads, after scraping the snow off my shitty car which was not made for this weather. All i could think was how the hell did it start snowing all of a sudden? Just yesterday it was sunny, and dry, in a cold winterey sort of way. There wasn‚Äôt a cloud in the sky.¬† But when my alarm rang, I was greeted with a serene coat of white covering the world outside. I looked out at the serene beauty of nature with nothing but  dread. My younger brother will almost certainly spend the whole day watching Minecraft videos on YouTube, since school will give him the day off due too the dangerous conditions. But unfortunately for me, my boss doesn‚Äôt care if I die.  
I drove through the freshly snow-covered roads out of the suburbs, past the small towns, into to the highway between two mountains, and arrived at the shitty little building in the woods where I worked. ‚ÄúFunkee Monkee Pizza.‚Äù I don‚Äôt know who the fuck was going to be getting pizza at this hour all the way out here, but this is my job. 

Our job at Funkee Monkee Pizza is to make a pizza every hour. There always needed to be fresh pizza ready to be served to the few people who ever came to this fucking place out in the middle of nowhere. We don‚Äôt deliver so the pizza just rots in the display case until we are required to make a new one and throw the old one in the compost bin. The compost bin is unlovingly referred to as the ‚ÄúBernard Bin‚Äù due to it having a photo of our boss, Bernard, with his wide smile, giving a ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù above a label reminding you to throw it out every two hours and that you would be severely punished if you ate any of it.

I walked past two of my co-workers, Tom and Elijah, and into the break room, praying to god Tom didn‚Äôt say anything when I walked past him. I had been up until midnight scrolling twitter, so I wasn‚Äôt exactly running on a lot of energy. We keep a coffee machine in the employee break room, but you have to sign a sheet saying you drank from it and it would be deducted from your paycheck, along with a mandatory fee for milk and sugar even if you didn‚Äôt take any. Every once in a while, I try to sneak a cup while nobody‚Äôs looking.

Tom, my co-worker strolled right into the room as I was sneakily sipping my morning brew. I nearly had a heart attack but tried my best to play it cool. He looked at me and then the sheet before whispering ‚ÄúLook, Cass, could you please just stop doing that?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, look, sorry. I just forgot to sign okay, I was going to do it after I finished.‚Äù I blathered out.

‚ÄúPlease, you know its against the rules, and Bernard says that if we see anyone breaking these rules, we are required to report it, and that makes me complicit, ya know. I don‚Äôt want to report you, but I also really don‚Äôt like going behind Bernard‚Äôs back like this.‚Äù

Tom was a Scrawny guy, looks about 25. Tom‚Äôs the type of guy who always has a big fucking smile that can really piss you off if you‚Äôre in the wrong mood. He‚Äôs always bringing doughnuts so other people will like him, and since everyone else seems to like him, I can never bring myself to tell him to shut the fuck up. He‚Äôs also the only person here who seems to like Bernard. He tells me that Bernard is friend of his family, which is what got him the job here. Every time I hear him speak he goes on and on about how much he loves this shitty job, about how satisfying it is to make a pizza and ‚Äúserve up smiles‚Äù or whatever. He‚Äôs the only person whose ‚Äúcustomer service smile‚Äù seems remotely genuine. Or maybe he‚Äôs just really good at faking it. Overall there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him as a person I guess I just find him really annoying.

I got on the floor and saw Elijah setting up the pizza oven. He turned to me, looked me in the eye and looked back at the oven without saying a word. Elijah had been working there longer than anyone else there. His employee tag said he was 42, but his face had the stress lines you would expect of someone at least 55. His slightly greying beard was scruffy and his hair was in dreads. He had deep sunken eyes, that looked like he had the life sucked out of them over the years. He wasn‚Äôt usually very chatty, I cant remember the last time I heard him speak to anyone outside of work duties. It was kind of hard for me to have an opinion on him.

Bernard arrived about half an hour late, but he‚Äôs allowed to do that because he wasn‚Äôt going to fire himself for it. Bernard is a man with a constant corporate smile that never quite semes to reach his eyes.

Bernard strolled, or more accurately waddled, up to us. His slim fit blue shirt and skinny jeans emphasizing his obese figure. His tie was a bright purple with a paisley pattern. Every day he seemed to have a new brightly colored tie with some crazy pattern that always looked stupid on him. He had a small coffee mug with the same photo from the Bernard bin plastered onto it. He gave one of those to all of his employees every Christmas as if that made up for not paying them anything above minimum wage. ‚ÄúHey there Funky Monkeys, crazy weather today am I right?‚Äù

He looked to Elijah, the only black man in the room, and joked ‚ÄúElijah, my homie, you‚Äôre looking like a real funky monkey today.‚Äù I have no idea if that was an intentional racist remark or if he‚Äôs just that fucking stupid.

Tom smiled ‚Äúheya Bernard, we were wondering where you were.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell look,‚Äù He said casually. ‚ÄúI have a little bit of a special task for you today, I know this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre used to‚Ä¶ I need you to hide a dead body for me.‚Äù

I thought it was another one of his weird, unfunny jokes. And that he would reveal he was actually planning another one of those ‚Äúteam building exercises‚Äù he makes us do after closing time without pay. Tom and Elijah seemed more confused than anything. But all doubt was done away with when Bernard dragged the body in through the front and dropped it on the floor.

It was the naked corpse of an Asian man, slightly obese, maybe early thirties. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt wearing any clothes when I found him.‚Äù Bernard mentioned glibly. His whole naked body, with every wrinkle, every hair, freckle or glob of fat was laid bare for all of us to see. He probably wouldn‚Äôt have been happy about that fact but maybe I can take solace in the fact that he‚Äôs too dead to care. The strangest part about it was the face, it was twisted and contorted into a frozen scream. One that didn‚Äôt die when he did. The cold freezing the echoes of his last moments of maddening terror. That ruled out him dying of the cold. If he had died of frostbite, he probably wouldn‚Äôt have done so screaming.

Tom was shaking, he looked like he was on the verge of tears. Elijah was just standing completely still, mouth slightly open and with the widest eyes I‚Äôve ever seen. I was pacing around the room with my head in my hands muttering ‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äù over and over again.

Tom was the first to speak up ‚Äúyou‚Ä¶ want us to like, hide this?‚Äù

Before Bernard could say anything I budged in ‚ÄúWho is this? Why can‚Äôt you just report this?‚Äù I wanted to ask ‚ÄúDid you kill him?‚Äù but I doubted Bernard would answer that honestly.

‚ÄúAre you kidding me? If it gets out that somebody died anywhere NEAR our establishment, what do you think what that could do to business? for sales, for customers, for the property value? I guarantee everyone in the Funkee Monkee family is gonna make a lot less tips. Look, for all I know, someone could come looking for this guy any minute, now all we got to do is move the body deep into the woods, somewhere where it won‚Äôt be associated with us. We have a few hours where the snowstorm will hide our footprints and eventually someone will find it, far away from anywhere where it could be associated with us. Now, if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill your duties here, I understand completely, but it will result in termination of employment.‚Äù

Elijah‚Äôs eyes somehow got even wider before he finally spoke up ‚ÄúWhere do you want us to put it?‚Äù he asked with a deep exhaustion in his voice.

I turned to him angrily ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry are you just okay with this?‚Äù

He glared at me with his tired, sunken eyes ‚ÄúNo, not really‚Ä¶ might was well get it over with.‚Äù

Bernard, still cheery as ever was tapping away on his phone. I‚Äôll send you a maker on google maps for where I think it would be best to dump it, it‚Äôs just out in the woods. Bit of a hike but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù He turned to Tom and put his hand on his shoulder. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll do this for me right Tom? It‚Äôs a heavy body so I‚Äôll need all three of you to carry it.‚Äù Tom started trying to stammer out a response before Bernard kept going. ‚ÄúLook Tom, you‚Äôve been my best employee for a few years now, and right now I‚Äôm giving you an opportunity to go above and beyond. After all I‚Äôve done for you, surely you owe me this one favor.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ we.. we‚Äôre just going to move the body right? Like we aren‚Äôt going to hide it really? nobody‚Äôs getting hurt. The families and everyone will still get closure, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight! yeah Tom, that‚Äôs the attitude I want to hear. I knew I could count on you. Good boy!‚Äù

I could not fucking believe what I was hearing. I watched as everyone turned to me, expectantly. ‚ÄúFuck you! No! I don‚Äôt want any part in this I‚Ä¶..‚Äù Their stares were burning into me, killing the words in my throat. There was no way I was going through with this, but they all wanted me to. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let us down Cass. We all need this.‚Äù Bernard said through his disarming smile.

‚ÄúCass, lets just get this over with.‚Äù Elijah chimed.

Tom didn‚Äôt say anything but gave me puppy dog eyes.

‚ÄúShut the fuck up, this is fucking illegal and... I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I just can‚Äôt.‚Äù

Bernard‚Äôs smile disappeared for a split second, before he put it back on and stepped towards me with his hands held open to me. ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôll admit this might not be entirely legal but do you know what? We here at Funkee Monkee are a family, and as a family we need to watch out for each other, isn‚Äôt that right you two?‚Äù My two co workers nodded glumly. ‚ÄúNow, if you don‚Äôt want to do this for us, then we might have to find some other explanation for the body, perhaps we could even say that you suddenly snapped and killed him. you wouldn‚Äôt want that would you? His mouth was smiling like always. But his eyes, usually dull and empty, were filled with contempt. ‚ÄúNow, that would still be bad for our business, but it would be much worse for you. Given that, I think it would be better for both of us if you do this for us. I‚Äôll stay here and make the pizzas, capiche?‚Äù

¬†

And so that‚Äôs how I ended up out in the woods, shivering in the snowstorm at 7 in the morning carrying a dead body in a bag by the legs. Trudging my feet through the snow with my only real light source being the flashlight on Elijah‚Äôs phone. My winter clothes weren‚Äôt the greatest, but I still couldn‚Äôt do anything about it.

Everyone had been completely silent for almost the entire trip. which wasn‚Äôt unusual for me or Elijah but, definitely for Tom. I could see him in front of me, Holding up the body by the stomach, barley managing with his skinny arms. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶. how much further?‚Äù he finally peeped up. Elijah, who was in the front holding up the shoulders, grumbled ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt get a signal out here, but last I checked we were about a third the way there, give it an hour and forty minutes.‚Äù

Bernard had given us coordinates to a spot to dump the body. It was deep into the woods and off the track of any hiking trails. I had a look at the map of the area and noticed the nearest building was another pizza place about a kilometer away.

‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe you guys agreed to this so easily.‚Äù I told them. Elijah just chuckled while Tom started sputtering. ‚ÄúHey, you agreed to this as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah well we could have told Bernard to just do it himself. but you guys left me alone‚Äù  
Elijah turned back to give me a dirty look. ‚ÄúI have a kid Cass. I can‚Äôt lose my job, I‚Äôm already making minimum wage. A week without a paycheck will kill us. I know you go home to your mommy and daddy who let you live with them cook all your meals but I‚Äôm a fucking adult who has to actually work for a living.‚Äù

I spent the next 45 seconds silently trying to figure out how to respond to that before Tom tried to change the subject. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ who do you guys think the body is exactly? Where did he come from?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think Bernard killed him.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, or whether he‚Äôs done this before, but he definitely murdered him.‚Äù  
Elijah laughed again. ‚ÄúNah, guy like him, You think he‚Äôs some kinda serial killer? Really? He‚Äôs a shithead but I don‚Äôt think he has it in him. If he did kill this guy, he probably hit him with his car on the way here. And now he‚Äôs trying to cover it up.‚Äù

Tom seemed weirdly mad at that. ‚ÄúYou guys Bernard is a really nice guy if you get to know him, I understand that he does some bad stuff some time, but running a business is hard and he‚Äôs doing this for the sake of our jobs and‚Ä¶‚Äú

‚ÄúTom. Shut the fuck up.‚Äù Elijah said, something I‚Äôd wanted to say ever since I started working here.

Tom decided to change the subject again. ‚ÄúDo we even know how this guy died? I couldn‚Äôt see anything obvious on the body.‚Äù

As they were bickering, I felt something I had never felt before, like several alarms in my brain, that I didn‚Äôt know were there, going off suddenly despite no stimulus. I got an implacable feeling of being watched. I can‚Äôt describe it as anything other than that. I could see that Tom and Elijah felt it tooyeah as both of them had stopped and Tom was looking around nervously. That was when I heard the footsteps, just barley audible, with the snow cushioning the steps. they were coming from right behind us. I had to force myself to turn around. It took every ounce of courage I could muster.

There was the face of a man inches away from mine, way closer than the footsteps made me think. I jumped back screaming like banshee. Tom and Elijah jolted at the sound, dropping the body bag before turning to look at the man. The flashlight on Elijah‚Äôs phone lit up his features in the pitch darkness. He was a tall Asian man, with a broad frame wrapped in a yellow winter coat. Like Bernard, He wore a smile that didn‚Äôt quite reach his eyes. The man looked so familiar, familiar in ways I couldn‚Äôt place until‚Ä¶ The realization felt like getting hit by a truck.

It was the corpse. It was the same fucking guy, he didn‚Äôt just look like he could be related. ¬†He looked exactly like the corpse we had been carrying in a bag.

‚ÄúHeya there.‚Äù He said ‚ÄúIts funny to see other people out here in this weather, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, uhh, yeah it is.‚Äù Elijah replied ‚ÄúWhat brings yyyyYYYYOOoouuuu‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Uh‚Ä¶ out here?‚Äù I could hear in Elijah‚Äôs voice the exact moment when he noticed it too.

‚ÄúOh nothing haha, just enjoying the winter weather y‚Äôknow. Hey, what‚Äôs in that bag you guys are carrying?‚Äù

[¬†]()‚ÄúOh, just some supplies. For work.‚Äù Tom sounded completely calm and composed despite the situation.

Tom added ‚ÄúYeah, yeah, our car broke down and y‚Äôknow we have to carry all these supplies to work.‚Äù

I could feel my heart beating in my ears. Every cell in my body was telling me this guy was bad news, or maybe that was just the fear of getting caught. The more questions he asks the more he could tell to someone investigating the body once it gets found. but it was hard to focus on not getting caught when there was a much bigger issue at hand. I knew that whatever this was, I had to get rid of him.

‚ÄúWell, we should probably get going, hope you have a nice day sir!‚Äù I said in my best customer service voice. Smiling through my teeth just like he was.

‚ÄúYes you‚Äôre right, I best be on my way, although I think I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping you guys carry that bag, it looks almost as heavy as me, haha.‚Äù

‚ÄúOhhhh‚Ä¶ Nonono sir you don‚Äôt have to do that we wouldn‚Äôt want you to waste your hike through this lovely weather on us. we hope to see you again sometime.‚Äù Inside my head I was fucking begging him to just leave.

‚Äúoh sure, haha. Hey, where do you guys work by the by? I‚Äôd love to stop by there sometime.‚Äù

Tom answered before I could ‚ÄúOh, just Funkee Monkee pizza. Look it up sometime. Bye!‚Äù

Idiot.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll be seeing you around. Laters!‚Äù¬† He trudged off into the snow covered forest, footsteps much louder than they were when he was walking towards me. He turned back to look at us for a split second just as the darkness swallowed him up and he was gone. Him leaving felt like watching a storm pass. Elijah turned the light on his phone back towards the direction we were going. As im recounting this, I‚Äôm only now realizing he seemed completely unbothered by the light from Elijah‚Äôs phone shining right in his face.

¬†

We wandered deeper into the forest. the snow kept getting thicker, the sun was still absent. We still couldn‚Äôt find a spot where we could get a signal. Nobody seemed to want to discuss what the fuck just happened or who that was. If we had lost our way and were going in the wrong direction we would have no way of knowing. Tom said something about how a couple of trees looked familiar, but neither of us knew what to do about that. At that point I wasn‚Äôt sure how we would even know we were at the dumping spot when we got there. We saw a broken down abandoned cabin.

After who knows how long I felt Tom tap me on the shoulder before whispering.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs following us.‚Äù

I began frantically scanning the dark forest, seeing absolutely nothing but snow covered trees. I whispered the message to Elijah. This seemed to agitate Tom, who I guess was hoping we wouldn‚Äôt speak aloud.

Elijah didn‚Äôt even bother whispering. ‚ÄúWho? The guy from earlier?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Tom, ‚Äúthe guy from earlier, he‚Äôs trailing behind.‚Äù

Elijah scanned the trees behind us with his flashlight as I had, also finding nothing.

‚ÄúWhat do we do?‚Äù I asked

Tom thought about it for a second. ‚ÄúI think we should have someone confront him while the others take the body away. Keep him distracted.‚Äù

The idea of being alone with that guy sent a chill down my spine. I couldn‚Äôt describe why or how. He was already creeping me out when we outnumbered him. ‚ÄúBad idea. Bad fucking idea.‚Äù

Elijah nodded. ‚ÄúYeah I don‚Äôt know about that, he gives me a bad vibe.‚Äù

Tom seemed absolutely taken aback. ‚ÄúWhat why? just cause he kind of looks like the guy who died?‚Äù

There was more to it than that, but I felt like I just couldn‚Äôt vocalize it in a way that made sense so I kept my mouth shut.

‚ÄúLook, most likely, he‚Äôs related to the guy.‚Äù Tom whispered. ¬†‚ÄúHe might be looking for him which could be a problem. If we distract him long enough to drop off the body, we can report it, giving him closure and hiding suspicion.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think he suspects something about us?‚Äù Elijah asked. ‚ÄúWhy else would he be following us?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, all the more reason to get him off of our trail. So keep your eyes out for him.‚Äù

Me and Tom both took out our phones for the flashlights. I hoped that deep seated instinct from before would start telling where he is, that primal feeling of being watched keeping me safe, but I felt absolutely nothing. Does that mean he isn‚Äôt here and I‚Äôm safe? I had no way of being sure. that was honestly more frightening than if I felt his presence. ¬†Trudging through the snow now felt like we were prey being hunted by a predator. One that we don‚Äôt even know the nature of. We don‚Äôt even know where we were going. Just hoping we had been heading in the right direction. I did not like the idea of finding out we were going the wrong way and having to turn back, only to find him trailing behind us. Being the one in the back meant if he snuck up on us, I would be the first person he got to.

As we hiked I began to feel a little at ease, which might have been wishful thinking. I wanted to believe that he had left us alone and we could dump the body in peace. It was still so dark despite how long we had been out there. ¬†After a while I heard Elijah stop and mutter. ‚ÄúHoly shit holy shit holy shit.‚Äù he was looking at something in front of us.

Tom started panicking, looking ahead. He and Bernard were blocking my view so I couldn‚Äôt see what it was.

I had to ask ‚Äúis it him?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Tom replied. ‚ÄúWe got to tell Bernard about this when we get back, this is really bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about? Who are you talking about?‚Äù

Tom and Elijah looked back at me before shifting to the side to give me a better view. There was another body lying in the snow. Up against a tree. It was covered in snow, but it looked naked, with a face frozen in a deep scream. Tom got out from under the belly of the body bag, leaving me and Elijah to have to support the weight. He ran up to the body. Examining it. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶ a woman, looks maybe‚Ä¶.. 65? I don‚Äôt see any cuts or anything.‚Äù He began looking around with his phone scanning the snow until he saw it. A lump in the snow. I set down the bodybag by the legs before apolizing to Elijah. I inched towards the bump slowly, I got a feeling I recognized its shape. but I desperately hoped I was mistaken. I began to cautiously dig through the snow on top of the bump,¬† trying to scrape it with my gloved hands., as if the snow was trying to fight back against me. I was met with a dead blue screaming face, lit up by my phone. I turned to Elijah and Tom who were staring at me with dread.

‚ÄúHow many more? Do you think?‚Äù I asked.

Elijah sighed ‚ÄúWho knows. There could have been dozens that we just didn‚Äôt see.‚Äù

Tom was hyperventilating at this point ‚ÄúOh God, Ohhhh god the the hell. W-what happened here how did they die? What is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre asking us for.‚Äù Elijah replied.

I asked ‚ÄúDo you think we could just leave the body here? There‚Äôs no way we are too close to the restaurant. It would be fine. We could send in an anonymous tip and they would find this body among the others.‚Äù Elijah suggested.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll ask him.‚Äù Tom said. I noticed his phone was dialing. I wanted to tell him no but he was already going.¬† ‚ÄúI got a small signal, I‚Äôm telling Bernard about all of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is Bernard going to do? Come up with another insane, poorly thought out plan and then force us to stick to it, I don‚Äôt want to hear whatever he- ‚Äú

Bernard‚Äôs blaring voice on the phone interrupted me.

‚ÄúHellooo, Funky Monkey Pizza, this is Bernard Milgram speaking. Just to clarify, we do not deliver, what can I do for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHeeeyy‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs Tom, we found more bodies in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúShit, are they close to the restaurant?‚Äù

‚Äúyeah, like halfway away from the restaurant and the drop off point.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell move them too.‚Äù

Tom was stunned. Elijah just groaned and rolled his eyes.

I sputtered out ‚ÄúWhat all of them?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes all of them. We can‚Äôt let a single body be found near our establishment!‚Äù ¬†

I looked around the place. We had no clue how many bodies there even were. For all we know, there could have been hundreds of bodies buried in the snow that we didn‚Äôt see. and any body we missed that gets found would be blamed on us. Plus that guy was in the area, possibly watching us. I could already see Tom unzipping the body bag, dragging the body of the old woman into it.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a guy who might be stalking us.‚Äù Elijah mentioned. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where he is but we saw him following us.‚Äù

Bernard paused for a second ‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶ yeah that does seem like quite the pickle, if anyone sees you doing anything with a body you would have to kill them haha.‚Äù

A silence hit everyone in the group like a truck. We were too stunned to say anything. the shock of what he had said left all of us shooting glances at each other hoping they would be the one to break the silence until Tom cracked.¬† ‚ÄúUhh‚Ä¶ Bernard are you, like, telling us to kill somebody. I- I don‚Äôt want to kill anyone, I think that‚Äôs a really bad idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúWOAH! hold your horses there kiddo I‚Äôm not telling anybody to do anything. I‚Äôm just stating the obvious fact that if somebody saw you doing something illegal like this, your only real option would be to kill them y‚Äôknow? After all, that‚Äôs the only way to stop all of us from going to jail since corpses don‚Äôt talk. Is it wrong to state facts?‚Äù

I could not believe what I was hearing. there is no way he thought any of us would buy that. Then again its not like I could think of a better solution if someone sees us. ‚ÄúYeaahh‚Ä¶ we um, know how being dead works.‚Äù Although given what I had seen today I might not be sure about that.

‚ÄúGood‚Äù Bernard said ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre on the same page then.‚Äù

‚Äúuh‚Ä¶ Are we??‚Äù

Elijah chimed in ‚ÄúI think we are.‚Äù Me and Tom looked at each other, hoping the other knew what to make of that.

‚ÄúAlright, you two keep your eyes peeled for anyone who might be watching us alright.‚Äù Elijah was speaking to me and Tom like we were his personal soldiers.

Tom hung up and looked at Elijah, ‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt killing anyone alright. we can find another way to deal with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen did I say I we were going to kill anyone?‚Äù Elijah asked. there was an apprehension in his voice.

We still had to do our jobs though. I thought about running away right then and there, but I was already doing something illegal with three witnesses. If I leave, then Tom would be alone with Elijah, but if me and Tom outnumber him, maybe we could stop anything to drastic from going down.

And then we could spend half of our lives in jail. I didn‚Äôt know what the penalty for this is exactly, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt good. I don‚Äôt know how we were going to convince anyone who sees us not to talk but I knew we had to try. It‚Äôs better than the alternative. If there was ever a point where I had a choice here, I missed it.

Tom tried stufffing the old woman‚Äôs body into the bag with the other one, but decided it would be too heavy. We decided it would be better to take the bodies one at a time. we had no clue how long that would take but we hoped there wouldn‚Äôt be any more bodies.

Suddenly Elijah shouted. ‚ÄúOver there!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but was looking off into the trees at something I couldn‚Äôt see. I thought it was another body at first but that hope was quickly put to rest.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs someone watching us. Not the guy from earlier, it was a woman. She was behind that tree.‚Äù Elijah began to sprint towards where he thought he saw our stalker. me and Tom exchanged knowing glances.

‚ÄúHey Elijah, what are you going to do to her?‚Äù Tom pleaded.

‚ÄúI just want to talk with her.‚Äù by the sound of his voice I don‚Äôt think he did. He began pacing around a tree. ‚ÄúWhere the hell are you?‚Äù Definitely not. His attention jolted towards another tree that I wasn‚Äôt looking at. ‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù He ran towards a different tree. ‚ÄúShe was just behind this tree didn‚Äôt you see it?‚Äù I looked around trying to see who he was talking about, until I saw an old woman peeking out from behind a tree next to the one Elijah was looking around. She was smiling. Her features looked subtly familiar until I realized who it was, I turned back to look at the screaming body of the old woman. It was the same woman. Just like the Asian man we met before, the corpse that was lying there screaming looked just like her. I froze in terror before looking back to the old woman who was now looking at me. She was wearing a yellow winter coat and had her mouth contorted into a smile showing all her crooked teeth her eyes were wide open and yet it was like I couldn‚Äôt see anything beneath them. I looked to Tom, he saw her too. Eliah turned around and noticed her and jumped in shock, falling back and dropping his phone. She ducked her head behind the tree, hiding herself completely from us.¬† ‚ÄúDo something you dumb shits, get her, she‚Äôs running away. I couldn‚Äôt see her running behind the tree but I took his word for it. Tom ran up to Elijah and grabbed him by the arm.

Tom pleaded with him ‚ÄúStop! Stop It, What are you doing. We aren‚Äôt killing any-‚Äù Elijah punched him square in the face, knocking him on his ass in the snow. Elijah didn‚Äôt say a word before running off into the darkness, the light from his phone bobbing up and down as he ran through the pitch black darkness.

I checked on Tom who was groaning. There was blood from his nose leaking onto the snow he looked up at me and yelled ‚ÄúStop him, please!‚Äù

I ran off towards where I thought Elijah had gone, until I saw his flashlight scanning the trees. desperately around him. I picked up a large tree branch and held it like a club.

‚ÄúWhat the fuck do you think your doing?‚Äù I screamed at him.

Elijah turned his head towards me, shining his phone directly in my eyes like a flashbang. ‚ÄúThat woman‚Äôs old, she‚Äôs lived a full life. My Daughter hasn‚Äôt.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even know if that old woman was alive, or human. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how the hell she‚Äôs so fast though. HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.‚Äù

‚ÄúTh-that woman.‚Äù I replied ‚ÄúShe looked exactly like the corpse of the old woman we found screaming

Elijahs eyes widened. ‚Äúoh shit, just like the‚Ä¶‚Äù I could see gears turning behind his eyes, each rotation causing his eyes to grow wider and wider, his lips starting to quiver.

We were cut off abruptly by an ear-piercing scream. It echoed through the forest like the call of an animal but it was distinctly a human scream. It was Tom. Elijah and I sprinted back to where we had left tom. We were running like a deer that had been seen by a wolf. when we got to where we remember leaving Tom, he wasn‚Äôt there. The other bodies weren‚Äôt there either. We were frantically scanning our flashlights around, trying to find where tom left them, but we saw absolutely nothing except the empty body bag.

‚ÄúTom!‚Äù I screamed out. ‚ÄúTom what happened?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt see any footprints around. despite the snow, there would still be some footprints visible to us if Tom had wandered off. there was nothing indicating the three bodies were dragged away

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Tom‚Äôs here Cass,‚Äù Elijah responded ‚ÄúI think whatever that thing is, it took away all the ‚Äúdead bodies while we were distracted.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think it took all three bodies on its own just like that?‚Äù I snapped

‚ÄúI think it took all four bodies just like that yes.‚Äù Elijah looked at the ground solemnly.

Elijah looked at the blood in the snow from where he had punched him. ‚ÄúMaybe she got him because we left him weak and vulnerable. I knocked him on his ass and you left him alone.‚Äù

I began to shake uncontrollably, crying. ‚ÄúTOM PLEASE CAN YOU HEAR US?‚Äù I was met with no sound but the constant droning blizzard and wind that I had been listening to all morning. I don‚Äôt know what I was crying about, I didn‚Äôt even like Tom all that much. ‚ÄúWHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU MAN?‚Äù ¬†I looked to Elijah with tears in my eyes. ‚ÄúThis is all your fucking fault you know that.‚Äù

Elijah shrugged. He was looking down at the ground he was hiding his eyes from me ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do much about it now.‚Äù there was a crack in his voice. He looked at the body bag for a second. ‚ÄúI say we just take this back and say we dumped all the bodies at the sight. We don‚Äôt know what else we can do.

I was keeping my distance from him, tree branch in hand

He checked his phone before walking off in whatever direction it told him the restaurant was. He looked back at me and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like staying in this forest any longer.‚Äù

For the rest of the walk back we didn‚Äôt say a word to each other. I kept looking around for signs of someone watching us but there was nothing. It was about 11AM so we could finally see without flashlights. Around every tree, rock and bush I expected to see someone watching us, to see the Asian man, the old woman, or even Tom smiling at us. But somehow we were left alone the entire time. Maybe whatever it was had it‚Äôs fill. Or maybe it was trying much harder at hiding itself. So all I had to keep me company was the silent Elijah trailing behind me and my own thoughts. My mom had taken me hiking in some woods near here when I was a kid. so these woods had always felt so safe and comforting up until now. When I finally saw the warm glow of FUNKEE MONKEE‚Äôs PIZZA just as it felt like my legs were going to give out from all the walking it was like seeing a lighthouse. I had never before been happy to see this place.

I there were no cars outside except the employee owned ones. I ambled into the empty pizzeria, I slumped down on the nearest chair to the entrance, throwing off my winter coat and taking time to catch a breath. Elijah came in after me and did the same. My legs felt almost numb, at this point. after all that had happened my body yearned for the opportunity to just sit down and not do anything. The pizza ovens warmed up the place quite nicely.¬† I wanted this brief reprive to last forever. I saw the no smoking sign taunting me from the wall. I looked to the pizza stands, with their shitty, greasy pizza shimmering from the lights. I collapsed down on a three seated round table next to the front door. Elijah came in after me and sat across from me, leaving the third seat empty.

‚Äúyou‚Äôre not out of the woods just yet!‚Äù Bernards voice called.

‚Äúwhat?‚Äù

He stuck his head out from inside the kitchen. He was eating one of the doughnuts Tom brought ‚Äúgotta get to work, remember? You are still on the clock.‚Äù He pointed to a clock on the wall with a sticky note on it that read **You** in big bold letters. Bernard was smiling from ear to ear at his hilarious joke.

I sat in silence for a few seconds, not wanting to move before I mumbled. ‚ÄúTom is dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúTom is dead. he died out there.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶‚Äù Bernard said it with the same tone as if I told him there was a dead skunk in the parking lot. ‚Äúwell shit.‚Äù

The story Bernard came up with for Tom‚Äôs disappearance was he turned off the security cameras (right around the time Bernard came in with the body, which is why there‚Äôs no footage after that point) and started trying to steal all the money from the cash register, only to get caught by his employees and run off into the woods, never to be seen again. The police bought it as far as I can tell. There was a small scale search for¬† in the woods and yet no bodies were found. 

It's been a week since then. Elijah brought his daughter in on his day off. She‚Äôs 7 years old, cute kid. She seemed so happy to be here, even though the pizza crust felt like cardboard and the cheese tasted like plastic, and it was covering the sourest marinara you‚Äôve ever tasted, she gobbled it up like it was fine dining. Elijah was unusually chatty that day, and at one point, while he was talking with one of my other co workers, he looked directly at me with his tired eyes mid conversation and said, ‚Äúyeah you know, I work hard to feed her, it would be a shame if anything were to threaten my employment.‚Äù His eyes were practically burning into my flesh there before he just looked back at my co-worker, continuing his conversation as usual. That was the last time I heard him speak to me about anything other than work duties.

The hardest part of all of this is probably the fact that even after all of this, I still have to go to work tomorrow. I still have to drive into those woods every day, and walk along the floor where a dead body was dumped, and see Tom‚Äôs employee of the month portrait on the wall, and sometimes even see Elijah working the shift with me. And every day, Bernard is there, to give me his big empty corporate smile. I‚Äôve considered telling the authorities what happened that day, but even if they would believe me, I would be implicating myself as well, and its my word against Bernard and Elijah's. I guess I'm only telling this to you guys now because i want the truth to be somewhere.  Statement ends.

Tim confirmed that miss Cassidy does in fact work for ""Funkee Monkee Pizza"" as did all the individuals mentioned in her statement. The story about Tom stealing money from the cash register and running off was the story given by Bernard to the authorities. Tim interviewed both him and Mister Elijah but they both refused to corroborate Cass's story, with Elijah asking him if he was a cop and telling him to get lost.

There ARE an unusually high number of missing persons living near or last seen hiking in the woods where Funkee Monkee Pizza is located. Sasha found several people matching the description of the two bodies Cassidy claims to have seen. Including an overweight looking Asian man Anthony Seo who was reported missing the day Cassidy's story would have taken place, and has been photographed wearing a large yellow winter coat. his disappearance remains unsolved. Still, there are a number of mundane explanations for someone to go missing in the woods, maybe they fell into the river, hit their head on a rock, or got attacked by a wild animal.

One thing Cassidy neglected to mention was that there was a search of the woods conducted by the Police to find Tom, although neither he, nor any screaming bodies were found. The only thing of note  that was found was an abandoned cabin. When it was searched, it had a massive pile of clothes, in all shapes and sizes and styles. Enough to dress at least 40 people. Many of them had DNA matching at least 7 missing persons, although none of those cases were ever solved due to this revelation. End recording.",3,1761427226.0,statementbegins,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve been living w these roommates since July and it‚Äôs great, I love them so much. They actually care about me and we support each other and it‚Äôs turned into a beautiful sisterhood. I‚Äôve been having this intense depressive episode. Like scream crying at night outside, putting myself in dangerous situations, and picking fights over absolutely unnecessary bullshit. I‚Äôm not usually this volatile. 

This morning one of my roommates got into a really stupid fight. I can acknowledge that a big player in this is that I‚Äôm naturally really messy and it‚Äôs a huge insecurity of mine. I always feel like I‚Äôm too filthy and disgusting to love. And I did let it get bad recently as I was home alone struggling with this episode and I let everything get away from me. My mind has convinced its self they both hate me and want me gone. 

Well I blew a fuse over my roommate cleaning up, specifically moving my medications. I always keep them by my coffee maker so it‚Äôs like right there in the mornings and I remember to take them.

They‚Äôve met recently and they continue to be in contact. Though is not clear to me if anything is happening or what is the points of their communication. AIO for wanting to break up?

¬†

Hello all, (sorry, this is a throwaway account). I‚Äôm a very anxious person who engages in lots of overthinking sometimes so I‚Äôd appreciate some advice.

I (f32) and my bf (m34) have been together for almost 3 years. I recently got an urge to look at his phone (I know maybe I shouldn‚Äôt) but I was quite shocked and glad I did?

He keeps in touch with an ex-fwb from almost a decade ago. How does this even happen? And I had no idea this person existed. She reached out to him like a few years ago and he always responds very eagerly even though he does not often initiate the contact. But they have kept contact over the years. So, I thought maybe he‚Äôs not interested but why respond and tell details about his life and ask about hers? Ok maybe just politeness‚Ä¶still odd. They live in different countries so maybe that‚Äôs why. He‚Äôs not a huge texter but he texts long messages to her.

¬†The worst part? Even though he talks about his professional life a lot and his studies, plans for the future, etc. He NEVER mentioned me!! So, for years she does not know I exist. You know when/how she finds out? Well, we live in a big international city and she was in our city on a business trip for some time (months maybe). Guess what? He invited her for a coffee‚Ä¶ when setting up the date (?), he talked about his availability listing various chores like doing some laundry, etc, etc, and finally, ‚Äútrying to find some time for‚Äù his gf. So, am I chore?? A burden? I interpreted as him trying to come clean and be honest with her in a way that cared more about her feelings than about how I was portrayed. His whole point was just to disclose that he has a gf but by minimising it. What do you think?

From messages I can tell they met and then silence‚Ä¶. For months. I thought that maybe things didn‚Äôt go great. But then she follows up months later and they have a huge ass message exchange where he actually appeared EMOTIONAL. The messages are not sexual or romantic. But only people who care about each other would do this right?

¬†I think she checked in kinda like a friend would, which is kind of ok. But then his response concerned me. Because she says she interpreted his lack of contact as a sign he did not wat to talk anymore. And he is like NOOOO I am always so happy to hear from you and I want to know about you. So she tried to end communication and he is like basically trying to stop her. He mentioned the many reasons he didn‚Äôt open up to her after the physical meeting, the main one being his busy and very stressful like atm. On the list of reasons, he mentioned ‚Äúour past‚Äù (!!!!), I mean their past created difficulties because of his gf‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. So again, I am a barrier, a problem?? After this, she‚Äôs like ok ok I understand, it was while it lasted etc. etc. bye. And he‚Äôs like noooo I wanna keep in touch. This is not the end of it but I am stopping here.

¬†I‚Äôm so confused:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† He initiates less but when it came time to in person contact, he took the initiative. Also I think initiating is not just being the first person to say/do something. Response also takes initiative, right?

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I think he felt ‚Äòsomething‚Äô or there is something between them and after the meeting he actually backed off not because of lack of interest but got stressed out because of his circumstances?

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I feel that he was probably thinking about her A LOT and waiting for her to reach out. Maybe if she made the move, he‚Äôd feel less guilty and reciprocate?

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Is this cheating?

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Is it significant he brought up the past? The girl never once mentioned the past. He was the first who did!! I think if he wanted just platonic, she‚Äôd probably accept that at least. But him bringing up the past means he thinks they cannot be platonic friends‚Ä¶ right? So he is impacted by that past still after all these years?",3,1761426678.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.81,False

I never had a girlfriend and I am still a virgin. Dating apps don't work for me at all. I didn't have a single like since more than two years now. I also asked out/confessed to quite a few girls that I like but I faced rejections each time. There were many times where I tought the girl I like was interested in me but whenver I confessed to her or made her understand that I like her, I got rejected.

At this point it is quite frustrating. I am so tired of meeting a girl, starting talking to her, thinking she is interested but whenever I think I will finally stop being a lonely dude, she tells me she is not interested or she is not ready for a relationship or any kind of excuse.

About a month ago, I met a 25 year old girl. She actually approached me and we met twice to have coffee together. She is a waitress and she offered me dishes at the restaurant where she works at. The last time we met (last Sunday), she told me very nice things which I tought were signals. She told me I have a very good looking face, she usually doesn't accept people in her life but she really felt a connection with me and was touching me.

I know I was probably stupid not to confess to her that I like her at that time but I tought I could do it next time. So I texted her on Thursday evening ""How are you?"" and she replied to me on Friday evening with something such as ""Good and you?"". Then I asked her if she was down to meet again and she still didn't answer my message. She changed her Whatsapp profile picture, was online all the time on Instagram and even posted a story on Instagram but didn't reply to me.

I feel quite upset that I tought I was so close to finally have a cute girlfriend but now I am brutally ghosted. I can surely consider this as a rejection.  Should I totally forget about this girl or maybe text her again after a while? I am also sick of hearing things such as ""There are so many girls"", ""Plenty of fish in the sea"". I am just very tired of being so enthusiastic about a girl but then suddenly being ghosted/rejected. I feel very sad and tired at the moment. I hate this pattern.

What I remembered most was Chanel - her mannerisms, hilarious things she'd say, outfits, the whole bad girl persona, I was fascinated by it.

Upon re-watch, I have to say I like the show on the whole less as it just gets a little tiresome to watch with every line being unserious. It's like a long, long sketch. But I still like Chanel the same and even more.

She's a charismatic and a creative leader who always takes initiative. She's fearless. She comes up with new ideas. She understands social dynamics and reads people well. She has a career track and that career is neither too shallow nor too boring (no career is boring in itself btw but I just mean that a news anchor is a really great career to my personal taste).

There's a short scene when Chanel and Grace are sitting at the coffee shop and Chanel is trying to get her on her side and then she opens up. At that moment, a whole different movie flashed before my eyes: after Chanel says she hated all the goody hippie stuff, if only Grace would have said something like 'Yeah, people can be so fake underneath'. I can just see it - Chanel sipping her coffee, looking at Grace distrustfully but curious to see if there's a real connection there. Grace, feeling sorry for Chanel's loneliness and helping her to move on to other interests aside bullying her minions. Them laughing at Chad, pranking him so that she wouldn't have to lose her wild side completely.

I'm surely too invested in the fate of a completely fictional, campy character but don't we get too few characters like her? The other examples of 'bad' protagonists are Cameron Diaz's character from Bad Teacher and Chloe from Don't Trust The B In Apartment 23. Wild Child as well but it's just a very childish movie, I can't relate much. So yeah, just wanted to share how much I love the character.

1og2j9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1og2j9v/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the caf√©s. Even the caf√©s can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a caf√©, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a caf√© wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their caf√© and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local caf√© can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

But just like music mode or coffee date, you could also join a specific niche stack that was just people that are tourists or are into seeing a tourist.

It just seems like a no brainer to me, or am I just like off base?

I would imagine it would be an option in your profile about resident v tourist. 

I am in a new city right now and actually have a lot of great dates. But that‚Äôs not always the case you can find anything interested in a tourist (at least in my experience).

I know short term fun can mean that as well, but in my experience sometimes people looking for long term relationships are okay with seeing a tourist bc then it‚Äôs easier to end it.

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24‚Äì48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During¬†**plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and¬†**red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to¬†**track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your¬†**overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq)¬†via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what‚Äôs called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes**¬†before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Not from a productivity standpoint, but more of a ‚Äúwhy am I always tired?"" kind of way. Instead of trying to overhaul my life to get more energy, I've been focusing on what works for me to keep me steady.

Something that‚Äôs been helping me to keep things in context is to think about simple rituals: going to bed at roughly the same time every night, no staying up late to get that last bit of writing done before bed; making sure to drink a glass of water before reaching for a cup of coffee; taking a few minutes outside every day no matter what‚Äôs on the schedule. I‚Äôve also been following some thoughts on a small blogging community that shares ideas of slow living at a site named Demure Wink.

These little habits sound almost too basic to matter, but they‚Äôve made parts of my day feel less chaotic. I‚Äôm starting to enjoy the quiet moments in between things instead of rushing past them. A bit more personal question: If you simplified a corner of your life recently, what did you experience?

I got that 32:05 very recently because the temperature has tanked here. I have found I am MUCH faster in cold weather, as I‚Äôm sure most of us are. Unfortunately it was warmer this morning than I‚Äôd hoped with 90% humidity :/ 

So that‚Äôs part of the reason I didn‚Äôt meet my goal but it also ended up being the very first day of my period!! I took two Tylenol when I woke up so I wasn‚Äôt cramping but I had a side stitch almost from the get go.

I‚Äôm bummed about the run but I signed up for another December that I‚Äôm expecting to absolutely crush. Question is are side stitches more common when you‚Äôre menstruating?

1og25u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/1og25u2/spoilers_the_lego_movie_2_the_second_part_just/,[spoilers] The Lego Movie 2 the second part just looking back is such a template for the modern woke approach to many mediums.,"So preface, I really enjoyed The Lego Movie, fun stuff even sort of making fun of the sort of Mary Sue esc character trope.

Roll on the Lego Movie 2 the second part and critics seemed to love it but despite audience good will from the first film and critical praise it didn't do as well as the first one.

I've tried to write this thing a few times now and figure out how I should do it, I was going to run through the basic plot but honestly I just couldn't seem to make myself write it so I figured I'd go through how it's a trope and if people care enough and don't know you can look up the plot or watch it somehow (though I'd advise against it honestly)

So I'll do a rundown of some of what I'd call the woke tropes it actually goes through:

---

**Toxic masculinity is the villain, by which we me all traditional masculinity and toughness unless it converts to femininity** 

 So right off the bat I'll say the big villain is Rex Dangervest in his ship the Bro Fist...... yeh real subtle guys when PewdiePie was saying Bro fist and even had a game out in 2015 call the legend of the Bro Fist...... I bet people who decided to throw shade at Pewdiepie are looking at the rise of Tate etc and regretting demonising pewdiepie as some ultimate evil influence on young men now lol.

the thing goes further though as Rex Danger Vest gives examples of his careers which just so happen to be all the male / masculine themed lego sets.

By contrast only Batman (who gets a makeover part way through to change him) is  on the good guys side and has masculine traits while not being an explicit villain or just background character.

Part of the end sequence of the film is about boys and girls playing together with Lego, but not with any of the traditionally male orientated sets only neutral of feminine. 

This somewhat falls in line with Feminist / Woke criticism of the time from the lines of Jonathan McIntosh that Lego sets he claimed aimed at boys / young men were too violent with too many guns and weapons etc. 

I mean the film makes it out as a big positive move that Superman and Lex Luthor end up living in a suburban neighbourhood getting along as good friends with no conflict. Same with other characters. I'd say this reflects the woke side thinking it's doing good moving into properties to remove any conflict and sees itself as improving them by say having a D&D module about managing a coffee shop not having to do any awful toxic fighting or anything.

---

**Shitty Romance plot** 

So one of the big sort of main plot is Batman marrying the alien queen leader because he falls for her personality and sees her as special........... yeh the plot of like 90% of shitty Romance novels.  Oh and to almost lampshade it there's a sparkly vampire character....... no really.

With shit like D&D having a university and a prom expansions and other properties having endless galas / balls / stand ins for proms while you could argue not a woke trope as it's marriage I'd argue with Anita Sarkeesian having a Birthday fake wedding event....... Weddings are a thing the woke side seem to also like along with the whole high school  and Prom stuff. 


---

**Denigrating the previous male character**


I mean there's literally a line in the trailer about of Emmet didn't really do much to save the day and Lucy did it all while he took all the credit. Also Emmet from the future timeline turning into the villain Rex Dangervest kinda of shows that. Joel anyone?

---

**Female characters can do now wrong / are redeemable even if they do something bad.**

So Finn's sister was apparently taking his lego stuff to build into her stuff to try and make Finn play with her........ but only what she wanted on his terms not really any other way and Finn being angry about that is presented kind of as a failure on Finns part with a sort of ""It's fine his sister just wanted to play with him and Finn was wrong to be angry"" kind or approach to him. Yes both get punished for fighting but Finn had also just found out his Sister had been taking his stuff for a while and while wrong to smash her wedding thing it's not really brought up how much stuff his sister has smashed of Finns over what's implied to be years now. 

Oh and the in Lego universe thing Queen WhateerIwannabi (Spelling I can't be bothered) who has been sending out people to take some of the Lego figures, she's not the villain because....... um she runs a utopian paradise or something that's entirely Cozy aesthetic themed with spars and salons and shopping and no actual conflicts and was trying to show the Lego world a better way such that Lex Luther and Superman no longer need to do any nasty fighting and can live in harmony........... 

 ---

**the follow up to success is the woke one**

So we've seen it quite often in gaming since. Something comes out with a big well received first entry and then the 2nd entry leans more heavily into woke messaging and elements like say Spiderman 2 on PS5 with more flags more side characters who were progressive coded and pushing Mile's heritage more but also screwing it up with entirely the wrong flag because apparently can't have Miles being proud of being American......

---
 
Anyway just wanted to get this out of my system. I'm sure people could find more in this or other subs will point and say something about me being paranoid or something, but I think the Lego Movie 2 the second part was and still is kind of the woke media take over template but also the first signs of people rejecting that kind of stuff,",14,1761425077.0,KotakuInAction,0,0.86,False

Curious to hear from other Ena 8 owners. I finally made the investment into a Jura after years of wanting one. I‚Äôve tried several of their machines over the years (a few hotels I‚Äôve stayed at had them and my uncle also has the S8). Always found them to make amazing coffee.

The Ena 8 seemed like a great option. Was small, offered plenty of drink options for my liking, and was relatively affordable - by affordable I mean when it comes to the jura line. I bought it from Sur La Table and made sure to sample a few different drinks at the store - they tasted great.

Fast forward to getting mine setup, and I just can‚Äôt seem to dial it in. The coffee always seems weak and watered down. I‚Äôve tried different grind settings, different beans, different roasts levels and can‚Äôt seem to get something that doesn‚Äôt taste super watered down or bitter. I generally make lattes or just drink a standard 8oz coffee (I tried splitting this up using 2x coffee option and had the machine pour the coffee in 4oz doses‚Ä¶ same issue)

I‚Äôve watched a ton of videos on YouTube about the machine, but none of the advice seems to change this. 

For a $2k machine, I want to make sure I LOVE the coffee it makes; it‚Äôs too expensive to be on the fence about it. 

Here‚Äôs my issue, though: sur la table will not give me a refund on the machine. They will only provide a replacement or I can exchange it for another machine. I‚Äôve been contemplating on exchanging it for the Jura E8. It‚Äôs a bit more money which I‚Äôm not thrilled about, but I‚Äôd rather spend a little more and love the machine than spend $2k for something that is sub par at best. I just don‚Äôt have another Ena to compare this to and can‚Äôt tell if my machine is defective, or it‚Äôs just not a good unit.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I‚Äôm 27, have ADHD, and undiagnosed autism. I realized around the beginning of this year that my depression symptoms and larger meltdowns have a routine that lines up with my cycle. The week before my period and the week of my period, I just feel awful, and the suicidal ideation is much heavier, plus just a lot of crying.

I‚Äôd never really tracked the mental health symptoms before, so I didn‚Äôt notice the timing. I talked to my psychiatrist and gynecologist about it, and they both started treating me for PMDD about four months ago. The gyno prescribed a birth control (Aurovela Fe 1/20, taken continuously), which has just fucked me up even more. I‚Äôve been taking desipramine for a couple of years because it seems to help with my depression, so my psychiatrist prescribed an extra 10 mg to take during the luteal and bleeding weeks.

I also take 20 mg Adderall regularly, but I‚Äôve stopped taking it during the luteal and bleeding weeks since it doesn‚Äôt help at all and tends to make me even more tired. With the birth control, I‚Äôm now getting 10-day periods every three weeks, so I have like 2‚Äì4 days where I feel stable in between, then the week before my start date, like clockwork, I want to die and cannot stop crying. I felt the shift a couple of hours ago and looked at my period calendar, it‚Äôs gonna start again in a week, ugh.

My motivation to start treatment for this was that I‚Äôm in grad school for my master‚Äôs in social work, and I have an internship from this past August until May. I‚Äôm an intern therapist and desperately need to feel more emotionally stable. I had to cut my work hours down to 10 a week to be able to handle school and the internship, so I‚Äôm only making like $300 every other week since my internship is unpaid.

I have a great support system in my boyfriend, family, and a couple of close friends, which probably keeps me alive. I take the Ditto menstrual supplement, iron, and vitamins for migraines (I‚Äôve had chronic migraines since middle school). I never used to eat breakfast, but about five months ago I started making sure I get food in me every morning, and I cut out coffee. I am a reallyyyy pick eater so I know for a fact I don‚Äôt give my body all the nutrients it needs. Also, for about 5 years I regularly used cannabis and it was so helpful (with depression, anxiety, migraines, and overstimulation), until this year. Now I take a 1-2 hits and I‚Äôm too fried and my anxiety sky rockets.

Every day is just about getting through the day and doing what I gotta do to manage. I feel uncomfortable, overstimulated, and like a burden 80% of the time. I‚Äôm feeling very hopeless and stuck. I really just don‚Äôt want to fight this or be here anymore. I know this post is all over the place, I‚Äôm kinda just brain dumping the major facts/factors in hopes someone has some advice that can truly help.

He knew it was Christmastime because they talked about it at school. There were signs and clues. They had made snowmen out of construction paper in Mrs. Ingold‚Äôs class on the first day back from Thanksgiving. The last Spelling Test before the long Christmas Break featured a black-and-white Santa Claus line drawing placed over half the page. The children were encouraged to color him in before the test began. (Mrs. Ingold always included a picture for the children to color on the test sheets each week. She tried her best to match upcoming holidays.) When the final Spelling Test of the year arrived on Phillip‚Äôs desk, and he saw jolly old St. Nick staring up at him, practically begging to be colored in, he knew for sure Christmas was just around the corner.

He got a 100% on the test- twenty words called out, twenty words perfectly spelled. In fact, he only misspelled one word, on one Spelling exam, ever. It was midway through first grade. The word was ‚Äúweb.‚Äù He mixed up the *b* for a *d*. (It was an innocent mistake; in lowercase they practically looked the same!) One single point deducted in two and a half years was very good. Still, it haunted him. He thought about it every Spelling Test day since then. As Phillip colored in the black-and-white Santa (by meticulously alternating his *RED* and *BRICK RED* Crayolas over the suit and hat, he masterfully captured the effects light and shadow had on the color of the giant elf‚Äôs fabric- *and what did* ‚Äú*color‚Äù mean anyway when it could so quickly change based on any number of factors*; he was a bright boy and a talented crayonist) he silently cursed himself for writing ‚Äúwed‚Äù two years ago.¬†

There were signs and clues. The weather played a factor; it was so cold and snowy each day the past few weeks. Plus, just going by the calendar, Thanksgiving always gave you a little heads up that Christmas was coming next. The context at school, the annual holiday schedule, the weather- all signs and clues that the world was moving toward December 25th. It was almost Christmas.

But not in his house.

His mother hadn‚Äôt been gone that long. This was only his second Christmas without her. She had known about the accidental *d* (he told her right away, before anybody else). She told him the *d* it was an easy mistake to make and not to focus on it. Move on. Easy for her to say- she‚Äôs not the one who humiliated herself on paper, in black-and-white. She‚Äôs not the one who‚Äôs Permanent Record will reflect, long into perpetuity, that she‚Äôs had some trouble with the word *web*. She‚Äôs not the one who blew it. But she told him to move on and it worked. She helped him to feel better. In the moment, at least.¬†

His mother was caring, understanding, and incredibly proud of everything Phillip did. These weren‚Äôt words or concepts Phillip particularly knew how to express in any eloquent sense. All he knew is that it felt good to talk to her and to be near her. She was the sun; he basked in her glow. You mixed up a *b* and a *d*, no big deal. Anybody could‚Äôve done it. You‚Äôll get ‚Äòem next time. And he did. Every next time. She got up early to make him oatmeal for breakfast while he sat quietly at the table smiling, watching her work. Sometimes she‚Äôd even treat him to toast with butter- topped with a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon- a delectable early morning dessert that surely no other boy in the whole entire world had ever even heard about, and here he was, lucky enough to have it for breakfast! *Benefactor! Comforter! Kindly Ruler of the House! Mother!*

This was all back then. Before she was gone.

Christmas left with her. His father didn‚Äôt see a need for it. Thought it spoiled the boy. Presents? For no reason at all? No, not here. *We aren*‚Äô*t doing that anymore.* And no tree. No stockings. No mention of it. Festive songs about love, warmth, and peace to our fellow man? No, you can‚Äôt have any. *We aren*‚Äô*t doing that anymore.*

Something else left with her, too. Something inside his father. The part that made him human seemed to have leaked out of him in the weeks and months after her passing, seeping out of him like little droplets of motor oil each day, little by little, until finally the trail went dry. It had left him, and in its place installed an insatiable little goblin who demanded daily tribute in the form of as much American pilsner beer as the man could put down a night. At least he wasn‚Äôt a booze hound, he thought to himself often, as he stared, disappointed, at his own face in the bathroom mirror. It‚Äôs beer. It‚Äôs just a couple beers. After a long day working to keep a roof over his own head, and this kid‚Äôs head, and keeping this lousy kid‚Äôs mouth fed after those doctors couldn‚Äôt do jack shit to save her, those phonies with clipboards, big words and even bigger medical bills... surely he‚Äôs allowed to have a couple beers. This wasn‚Äôt part of the deal, after all. The deal was doing this all together. Not alone. Not by himself. Together. Man and wife. But the failure of those medical men and medical women to act in time... they screwed him. Her illness screwed him. Fate screwed him. Life screwed him.

And now the boy, just by existing, screwed him.

The living room reflected in no measure whatsoever that it was Christmastime, or any other time at all. It was just a room. A place to put the boy while he sulked. Keep him *over there.* Keep a wall between them. Wasn‚Äôt it enough to feed him and let him live here, *even after*\-- !

There won‚Äôt be presents. Lights. Songs. A tree. No, *we aren*‚Äô*t doing that anymore.* He can tell the other lousy kids at school whatever he wants to tell them. Make it up. If he‚Äôs such a brainiac, such a creative child (her words) then he can use his imagination. Put that big brain to work and conjure up some presents of his own. After all, she doesn‚Äôt get to have a say anymore; she‚Äôs gone. And this, whatever this is, wasn‚Äôt part of the deal. There will be no signs or clues in this house. It‚Äôs not Christmas here. In fact, it‚Äôs not anything here. It‚Äôs the same day it always is, The Worst Day of Your Life.

Phillip was indeed putting that brain to work. He set up shop at the coffee table in the living room. He brought home some paper from school, and had his artist‚Äôs tools (pencils, a sharpener, an arsenal of magic markers) arranged *just so* on one side of the table. Since there were no signs and clues of Christmastime in this house, he‚Äôd make his own. He first sketched the reindeer, the Christmas trees, the snowmen, and, of course, the giant bearded magical elf himself, SANTA CLAUS, in pencil. Then, once everything was in place, he took up the magic markers. There wasn‚Äôt any back-and-forth- once he moved from pencils to markers, that was it, drawing time was over and it was time to color. It was while adding color to the drawings that the scenes really started to feel real. He was no longer outlining, planning, or imagining *what could be.* No, now he was giving those images vibrancy and depth and life. Adding strokes of light blue to the snowmen‚Äôs torsos took the piece from idea to reality. He was in there with them, in the cold, dancing and singing a snowman song that the snowmen had taught him right there on the spot. As he gave the green Christmas trees strands of lights (red, yellow, purple, pink) he felt the warmth radiating off of them. He was standing right there, admiring each tree‚Äôs festive glory, in person. Beautiful trees. Handsome snowmen. Great spot, the North Pole. It was Christmastime. It was cozy. It was real.

Phillip had just started to add some red to the hat atop Santa‚Äôs head when he heard a *knock-knock-knock* at the front door. Santa was ripped away from him, and he from Santa. He was no longer in the North Pole helping the big man prepare for his trip around the world, surrounded by snowmen, holiday trees, and smiling reindeer, right there, in the thick of it, in a place where it‚Äôs always Christmastime. Signs and clues? *Please!* The whole place and everyone in it only existed *because* of Christmastime. The very DNA of the place was of Christmastime. It was such a happy place. So much better than--

*Knock-knock-knock*.

It brought him out of the trance. It yanked him very abruptly from the colorful, vibrant scene and dropped him right back in the dismal living room, the place his Father relegated him during the waking hours. There they were, the characters he conjured up with his pencils and markers, flat on the page, engrossed in their Christmastime world, small and silent now-- and there was he, on the outside, staring overhead like an observer, a foreign entity.

*Knock-knock-knock*.

‚ÄúNow who the hell is that?!‚Äù his Father bellowed from the kitchen. Phillip flinched at his voice. It was one thing to *knock-knock-knock* and transport him back to the living room. It was another thing entirely to summon his Father to the room as well. The lines of demarkation on the first floor of the house were unspoken but clear. Phillip was to occupy himself in the living room with homework or other quiet things. (Drawing was frowned upon but technically legal. Just don‚Äôt get anything on the table or you will pay, I promise you that.) His Father stayed in the kitchen where he listened to talk radio or the game (any game) and numbed himself nightly with beer after beer after beer. The mysterious visitor at the front door certainly couldn‚Äôt know that his innocuous knock had set in motion a collision of worlds- in came his Father, the full weight of his annoyance clear in his gait and demeanor. Phillip felt sympathy for whoever had decided to darken their doorstep this winter evening, as he or she was going to realize what a mistake that was and quickly.

As the man stomped toward the front door, he gave the boy a glance. It was half a glance, really- he needed to get this door OPEN and see what the BIG EMERGENCY was that somebody had to trample like an elephant up the porch and POUND incessantly on the door like a lunatic, what the hell could be so important! But in that half a glance he saw magic markers on the coffee table and oh boy did that light a fire. Suddenly the thought of one of those markers going rogue and marking up the coffee table made him bristle.

‚ÄúBoy, if you make a mess on that table, I‚Äôm gonna crack you.‚Äù He tossed the threat at him as if it were a grenade that would only detonate if the recipient did, in fact, make a mess on that table. *Incoming! Catch! There you go, it*‚Äô*s yours now. Watch out!*¬†

His father ripped the door open with such needless force that Phillip thought it might just tear free of the house. For all he knew the man was strong enough to do it.

‚ÄúWhat the hell do *you* want!‚Äù his Father barked at the open doorway. The biting cold rushed in. There was nobody there.

‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

The *knock-knock-knock* from just a moment ago now seemed to take on a mocking tone in his Father‚Äôs mind. Was this someone‚Äôs idea of a prank? Was this giving someone a laugh? Is someone hiding in the bushes? A friend of the boy‚Äôs from school, maybe? No, he didn‚Äôt have those kinds of friends. He didn‚Äôt have friends at all. Just what the hell are these hoodlums trying to pull! Good thing they ran off, otherwise I‚Äôd--

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Grandpa!‚Äù he heard the boy exclaim brightly. He looked down and saw a small present, neatly wrapped in old-timey holiday wrapping paper complete with a bow, placed square on the porch just in front of the door. He must have missed it when he swung that bastard open.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Grandpa!‚Äù It stung. Grandpa, indeed. The old man just wouldn‚Äôt give up. It was over. She‚Äôs gone. Stop meddling. If you like the kid so much why don‚Äôt you take him. And what are *you* so excited about, you little shit. It‚Äôs probably a piece of junk he wrapped up to try to turn you against me. The son of a bitch is getting a little strange in his old age. (He thought that even before, before she left. Before those cock-sucking doctors took her away. Before it was so damn cold out.) And now he was playing mind games trying to manipulate the boy. Wasn‚Äôt a man allowed to wind down in the kitchen and put on the radio and just have some peace some quiet without people pounding on the front door all night like goddamn animals. Jesus it‚Äôs cold out there. The half-filled beer bottle stung in his hand as if the glass itself was freezing just from coming into contact with the air out there. This cold was really something else. It didn‚Äôt used to be this cold, before--

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Grandpa!‚Äù Signs and clues. This mysterious treasure left just for Phillip confirmed the magic of the season to him even more. He was Rapunzel, locked in a Christmas-less house, with no hope but to create his own little Christmas with his markers and paper. And somehow that had conjured up a real live Christmas present- there it was, right there on the doorstep! Somehow he and Grandpa were in sync and their psychic connection was on full display, thwarting his Father‚Äôs rules. It was Christmastime, it really was, no matter what it looked like in here. It was Christmastime no matter what his Father said. It was Christmastime, darn it, and this was proof. If a present wrapped in a bow sitting in fresh powdery snow wasn‚Äôt evidence enough that it was Christmastime, then what else could ever be?! Signs and clues.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs from Grandpa!‚Äù

‚ÄúI SAID SHUT UP OR I‚ÄôLL CRACK YOU!‚Äù¬†

II.

Phillip sat quietly, eyes locked on the present. His father‚Äôs voice boomed from the kitchen. The man paced around the kitchen as he talked, tethered by the telephone cord.

‚ÄúAnd who the hell do you think *you* are! To undermine *me!‚Äù* There was a pause. He imagined that his Grandfather asked why he couldn‚Äôt leave a present for his Grandson. A fair question!

‚ÄúBecause people don‚Äôt get something for nothing, that‚Äôs why. Because your daughter spoiled him with all that bullshit, and I don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why. *And because I said so, old man, that*‚Äô*s why!* Now don‚Äôt send any more junk here! I already got the junk kid she left me to deal with.‚Äù

Phillip didn‚Äôt move during this tirade. He barely blinked. His Father‚Äôs words were not words he wanted to hear. He focused on the beautiful Christmas present, as gorgeous as it was illegal. He didn‚Äôt have a single guess as to what was inside, and he didn‚Äôt care. The wonderment that a present was there at all was enough; the boy was buzzing. He was fascinated with the wrapping paper, which had a reflective surface. The green and red pattern was shiny indeed. Something about the smooth texture and the way the light in the room bounced off it made the gift even more exotic. Romantic. It was a secret, shiny, outlaw of a present. God he wanted to rip that bow off, tear the beautiful, shiny, forbidden wrapping paper away and see what spoils lay within. Or maybe he‚Äôd *never* open it- just stare at it forever and wonder. If he never opened it, then the possibilities could remain open and endless.¬†

His Father SLAMMED the phone down HARD. Phillip flinched and squeezed his eyes shut defensively. When he felt safe enough to open them, he focused again on the gift. If he stared at the red and green pattern long enough, maybe his rotten Father would disappear and come back nicer, the way he used to be. Or maybe he‚Äôd disappear himself. Or maybe (*Please!*) she would come back home, which would be best of all. The wrapping paper was shiny, just like her. It reflected the light of everything around it, just like she used to do. She was beautiful. She was perfect.

‚ÄúGo to bed!‚Äù his Father snarled, unseen, from the kitchen.

Maybe he would open this present and out she‚Äôd climb, back home for good, shiny, perfect, alive, and proud of her boy. You mixed up a *b* and a *d,* no big deal. It was one test. It was one point. She was The Sun.

‚ÄúI said go to bed-- you want me to tell you again?!‚Äù Phillip picked up the implied threat of physical violence even before he heard the bottle *crash* against a kitchen wall. He bolted for the stairs. When he made it to the top of the stairs, he hesitated. He looked back down to the living room and saw the thing practically glowing on the coffee table. It was radiant. It called to him.

*Open me.*

His Father coughed a little (even the man‚Äôs cough startled the boy, he knew they were close to the man‚Äôs breaking point now, he didn‚Äôt want to be the next thing his father threw against a wall), cleared his throat, and then went silent. He would sometimes pass out right there in the kitchen. Typically he would wake early morning and find his way to the bedroom. But that would be hours from now.

*Open me.*

The thing was practically glowing! It called to him. It pulled at him. The tiny gift had its own gravity and Phillip couldn‚Äôt fight it. How could he? He was just a child.

He tip-toed back down the stairs, trying to put as little weight as possible into each step. Down he crept, eyes fixed on the gift.

*Open me.*

He stood silently, just in front of the coffee table. He heard a brief involuntary *snort* from the kitchen. He almost jumped through the roof, sure he‚Äôd be caught.

A moment passed.

He winced, waiting for the explosion.

Nothing. Close call.

Eyes back on the gift.

*Open me.*

Full-on snoring from the kitchen now. His father was out cold. Phillip grabbed the forbidden present

*Open me!*

and tip-toed back up the stairs to his room.

III.

Phillip didn‚Äôt know how long he‚Äôd been staring at the present. He was in a trance, mesmerized by the wrapping paper. It wasn‚Äôt anything special, really, just a simple holiday pattern: Christmas trees in green, overlaid on a red background. It was funny how simple patterns like that seemed to catch his eye and keep hold of it. Nothing special, just little green trees. But he was deprived here, in this Christmas-less house. No tree, no lights, no music, no mention of the word- and this pattern scratched the itch.

The paper had a metallic sheen to it, which was enhanced by Phillip‚Äôs dinosaur nightlight on the wall, a relic of from his younger days. He‚Äôd spend nights staring at that stoic triceratops (colors slightly faded, one eye missing), his imagination running to places never before known, as he drifted off to sleep. It was a fixture in his bedroom and, presumably, would be well into his teen years when he would use it to read contraband issues of Playboy found in a dumpster behind a school or hidden in the woods (the phenomenon of *found pornography* was a very real possibility, according to chatter he‚Äôd heard from older boys at school). The dinosaur provided a single watt (barely anything), just enough light to illuminate his nightstand without spreading to the hallway and alerting his father that he was still awake. (Not that he‚Äôd notice; he‚Äôd be snoring in the kitchen for hours now.)¬†

Phillip couldn‚Äôt resist any longer. He was reluctant to destroy the beautiful wrapping paper but he had to see what was inside.

*Open me.*

In a flash he tore it away and saw a small white box. Phillip carefully pulled the top away and revealed the forbidden treasure within: a small glass vial, about three inches in length, and about the thickness of a battery. Placed curiously inside the glass were small bits of-- what? Rock? Stone? Petrified wood? It was impossible to say. One fragment looked like a chunk of a tooth. (Phillip lost a tooth earlier this year- he could see the bicuspid in his mind‚Äôs eye and supposed this little thing in the glass looked close enough. *What about these other bits? What did a finger bone look like?*)

Earlier this year Mrs. Ingold took his class to the Museum of Natural History in a magical departure from the structure and sameness of life in elementary school. Even the most intelligent, precocious child eventually tires under the repetitive nature of mandated school hours and schedules: diligently designated times for every little thing, standing in line after line, raising one‚Äôs hand to use the restroom, requesting permission for a tissue paper to blow one‚Äôs nose, not to mention the never ending stream and flow of *papers*\-- filling out papers, folding papers, turning papers in, collecting papers, passing papers back, posting papers on the wall, bringing papers home, getting papers signed, bringing papers back, and on and on and on. It was at the Museum of Natural History that Phillip first noticed the indescribable and intangible thrill that transcended this rote existence, the phenomenon of *attention from a girl*.

Her name was Jessica Carpenter. The two of them were fixated on the same triceratops skeleton (fully articulated). The sheer size of the creature astounded them, first of all. Then the foreign, otherworldly nature of the animal itself washed over them. They struggled to comprehend that a creature of this magnitude could possibly exist on the same planet that they themselves stood upon doing their mundane additions and subtractions. It shattered Phillip‚Äôs reality to know that this creature was born, walked, grew to wholly gigantic proportions, ate, slept, stood, ran for its life, and was just one specimen in a long line of millions before and millions after, for eons, on the same land that he himself sat at a desk, tightly-squeezed in a confined claustrophobic classroom memorizing state capitols. It was mind-bending.

Phillip had been taking a closer look at the surface of the fossils- the legs, the skull, the teeth- when the arm of his jacket brushed against hers. The contact was barely noticeable, and yet both he and Jessica Carpenter were paralyzed with equal parts glee and fear. Jessica Carpenter‚Äôs mother was a parent chaperone and had witnessed the scandal. Phillip focused on the surface texture of the dinosaur teeth as hard as he could while his face flushed hot and red, hoping to avoid the full-bodied embarrassment of the crime of jacket-to-jacket contact. For the rest of the field trip, the two students were spotted near each other, always vaguely in the same orbit, always curiously observing the same exhibit. It was extraordinary. Mrs. Carpenter hovered nearby, just out of their sight, watching over her daughter with a covert smile. It was a romantic scandal of epic proportions and the Museum of Natural History had never seen anything like it.

The rough, stoney surface of the articulated triceratops bones flashed in Phillip‚Äôs mind. Whatever was in the vial from his grandfather had a similar surface; the same texture that was both rock-like and organic at the same time; they could have been scavenged from the same dig site.

He was perplexed. What sort of gift was this? Was his Grandfather playing a prank? Or maybe he gave his grandson the wrong present. Maybe he got confused, wrapped up some bizarre oddity, had a fight over the phone with his son-in-law, and now here Phillip sat, staring at a glass vial full of weird little whats-its.

Then he saw the note (it had gotten stuck to the inside of the wrapping paper). There was a terse message handwritten by his Grandfather. With the help of his trusty triceratops nightlight, Phillip read the note:

**MAKE A CHRISTMAS WISH. BUT ONLY IF YOU REALLY WANT IT.**

He looked from the note to the glass vial, and back again. *Make a Christmas wish?* Was something missing? Is there something else in the wrapping paper? He searched, certain he‚Äôd find the missing link that would help this all make sense. But there was nothing- just the little green Christmas trees on one side of the paper, and the white nothing on the other. *Huh.* Maybe there was something else in the box, another note perhaps. He looked and looked, but didn‚Äôt find anything else. He was stumped.

He read the note again.¬†

**MAKE A CHRISTMAS WISH. BUT ONLY IF YOU REALLY WANT IT.**¬†

It was a nice sentiment, but he couldn‚Äôt seem to connect it to the strange thing in the box. *Make a Christmas wish.* Isn‚Äôt that something his grandfather should have asked him to do a few weeks ago? It‚Äôs a little late now, he already wrapped the thing. And if he did, in fact, ask him a few weeks ago, Phillip thought, he certainly wouldn‚Äôt have wished for a glass vial filled with little chunks of..*. whatever* this is.

He took the vial in his hand and held it up close to his eyes. He definitely saw part of a tooth in there, he was sure now. The rest, who could tell. Maybe shards of animal bones. Maybe this was part of a science experiment. Or a souvenir from a museum. He knew his grandfather traveled a lot, maybe that was it. Something of historical note. But what? And why?

He shook the vial gently. The contents jostled inside the glass.

*Clink-clink-clink.*

Phillip froze. Was that too loud? Did it wake him? He looked ominously to his bedroom door and listened for any disturbance from downstairs. A few seconds passed. Then half a minute. Then a minute. Nothing. He was in the clear.

He read the note from his grandfather again and focused on the second part. *But only if you really want it.* It sounded like a warning. Maybe the old man was getting funny. Losing it a little. Maybe his grandfather explained the whole thing over the phone to his father and his father knew exactly what this was, and what the note meant, but now he was passed out drunk in the kitchen. He‚Äôd forget, or refuse to tell. Phillip could never ask. Not in a million years. He would have to remind him of the present, then confess that he‚Äôd snuck back down, taken the present, opened it... that train of thought only led to bad endings. Bad, painful endings. Any information his father did or didn‚Äôt have was lost forever. Back to square one.

Just then he heard something downstairs. Footsteps. He quickly hit the switch on his nightlight and held perfectly still. Even an errant movement on his mattress could be too loud and bring the monster upstairs. He kept motionless on the bed. The drunk was probably just finding his way to his own bed. More footsteps. Then silence. Then:

‚Äú...TOLD YOU NOT TO MAKE A MESS ON THIS DAMN TABLE!‚Äù What followed was the sound of his father flipping the living room table over, and it crashing into the floor. The next noise was most likely the living room lamp shattering against a wall. It was hard to be absolutely sure though. Phillip threw himself under his covers and hoped that was the last of it.

‚ÄúGONNA WHOOP YOUR ASS TOMORROW!‚Äù he heard his father sputter out.

Another *CRASH*. A bottle or a glass, probably (or another lamp-- how many lamps were there? he tried to remember). He wondered if any classmate of his was spending Christmas Eve like this- frozen in bed, missing his mother, worried the next impact he heard would be his own head against the wall (a legitimate concern when his father got like this).

This never used to happen. Outbursts like this were unfathomable- or relegated to movies or scary stories. Life used to be perfect. When she left everything changed. Not all at once, of course. Little by little, the rot set in. That‚Äôs what it was. Rot. Little by little, day by day, inch by inch, his father went from man to beast. From caring protector to reluctant warden. A few years ago he didn‚Äôt know a father (any father) could hurt a son. Didn‚Äôt think it was possible. Although he didn‚Äôt have the words for it, he did have a mental concept of it; he saw it as a sort of universal law of nature. *A man will not willingly bring harm to his child*. Now it was clear he was mistaken. There was no such law of nature. It was a suggestion, at best, and could be ignored. The more the man festered, the less effort it took to bypass suggestions like that. The change was so slow it couldn‚Äôt be detected day-to-day. But all Phillip had to do was remember what it was like a few years ago. The difference was stark. That man downstairs was no longer his father. No, his father would be proud of him for his perfect Spelling Tests (one point deducted in three years!), his good grades, his interest in drawing, his reading comprehension, his knack for math. That man downstairs, however, resented him for it. The rot set in and made him feel alone, weak, powerless and pointless, and convinced him it was all the boy‚Äôs fault. That was the rot. That was what the rot did. Gave him a target to put all the bad feelings on.

Phillip didn‚Äôt think he would come upstairs right now to punish him. The stairs would be too much for him, thank god. But things didn‚Äôt look good for tomorrow. While his classmates were opening their Christmas presents, smiling with their families, and watching Christmas specials on their TVs under the soft glow of the lights from their trees Phillip would be hiding in his room waiting for the explosion. At some point his father would wake up, see the destruction in the living room- the overturned table, the broken lamp, the shattered-whatever-else- and it would be Phillip‚Äôs price to pay. There was never a moment of contrition or understanding or self-reflection. It was like there was always a fuse lit somewhere in the house and it was just a matter of how long it took for the bomb to go off. Sometimes it was weeks, sometimes mere seconds. Sometimes the bomb was asleep all night or all day, but the wick, like a pilot light, was always lit, always burning, and the bomb was perpetually on the brink of combustion.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt fair. Why *couldn*‚Äô*t* he live with Grandpa? Why *did* he have to stay there? Why was home an open-air prison and why did he have to tip-toe around and why *was* every day the worst day of his life? He hated it. Hated him. Hated everything about him. He wanted his Mom back and he wanted freedom and he wanted that man gone.

‚ÄúGONNA WHOOP YOUR ASS TOMORROW!‚Äù

No stories about reindeer, mangers, little drummer boys, no tucking-in, no prayers, no I-Love-You‚Äôs, no stockings, sugarplums or anything else. Not for Phillip. Just a belligerent heads-up that tomorrow he‚Äôs gonna get his ass kicked by a grown man with a hangover who for some reason hates his fucking guts.

‚ÄúGONNA WHOOP YOUR ASS TOMORROW!‚Äù *Why wait? Come on up! I*‚Äô*d like to see you try to make it up these stairs, fucker!* The triceratops rolled his (one) eye. He‚Äôd never speak up that way to his father, and the dinosaur knew it. He didn‚Äôt have the guts. He‚Äôd just let it happen, over and over again. He‚Äôd allow himself to be smooshed, smaller and smaller, crushed into dust, a pile of pointless little purposeless flakes. That‚Äôs what life was now. She‚Äôs gone and you are dust. There‚Äôs no happy ending. There‚Äôs no sunshine in the morning and there‚Äôs no future any better than this. Every day is The Worst Day of Your Life and there‚Äôs nothing else, there never will be, and it‚Äôs only getting worse.

‚ÄúI wish he was dead,‚Äù Phillip muttered unconsciously. It was so casual he didn‚Äôt even realize he said it. He meant it, though. Whether he knew it or not, it was something he felt and thought, on again and off again, every few days or so. It would come and go based on his father‚Äôs moods but it never *really* left. He didn‚Äôt know how else to word it and that was the simplest way to put it:

‚ÄúI wish he was dead.‚Äù

*Clink-clink-clink.*

Did he shake the glass again? He looked down to his hand- the vial was still in it. But he didn‚Äôt shake the thing, did he? He was holding perfectly still, careful to not provoke the lunatic downstairs. But he heard it: *clink-clink-clink*. Or did he? Maybe it was in his head. The little bits of bone aren‚Äôt alive in there hopping around like Mexican jumping beans. If the gift were ever alive (or part of something that was alive) it‚Äôs dead now. Inanimate. And has been for decades, by the look of it. Centuries even.

*Clink-clink-clink*.

He was perfectly still and it can‚Äôt move on its own. But he was sure he heard it.

He put the small glass vial on the nightstand. What a strange thing to give somebody. Maybe someday when he‚Äôs older he‚Äôll find out what his Grandpa meant by leaving this for him. And why *couldn*‚Äô*t* he just go and live with him instead? Why didn‚Äôt Grandpa fight for him, take it to the courts? Maybe he already tried. Maybe he‚Äôs too old. Maybe... before he knew it he was asleep, having fallen helplessly down into the abyss of darkness, swaddled tightly by dreams too thick and amorphous to make sense of.



IV.

The cold woke him. Typically the house was cool at night but not this cold. Especially under his blankets, which usually kept him insulated and warm. Not tonight. He was cold. He woke without opening his eyes and wondered if a window was open. That would be odd but what else would explain the biting, freezing cold and the icy feeling he had all over.

He realized his entire body was shivering.¬†

He opened his eyes.

He saw his breath in front of his face and thought he must be dreaming. That‚Äôs a thing that happens outdoors, isn‚Äôt it? He was entranced. Each exhalation produced an unmistakable fog of moisture which dissipated into the air in front of him. Are the windows open? Is the roof caved in? How else could it be so cold in here? His muscles ached from the shivering.

Phillip sat up, wrapped his comforter around his body tightly and saw something standing at the foot of his bed. His eyes were still adjusting but through the darkness he could immediately see the shape of a man- his father? No, not his father; someone much bigger. As his eyes grew accustomed to the dark room and the figure was made more clear, Phillip couldn‚Äôt quite understand the grotesque spectacle he saw before him. The shape looked as if it were wavering, as if an unseen wind was disturbing it (though not affecting anything else in the room). It was draped in dark, rotted, filthy, rags which seemed ancient (and red, he thought). It appeared to be half-solid and half-fog, and carried a very dull ephemeral glow which made Phillip feel like puking. There were steaming hot embers where eyes should have been. Around the embers was a decayed skull (or most of one) that must have been centuries old (cracked, with most of the teeth long-since gone). Within the tattered rags were its ancient bones, as weathered and splintered as timber from an old forgotten ship from an old forgotten age. The horrible specter hovered at the foot of Phillip‚Äôs bed, and Phillip imagined it was looking both *at* him and *past* him at once (it was hard to tell, as there were no eyes). The embers were mesmerizing- once he scanned the horrible creature head-to-toe (though the ‚Äúhead‚Äù was not really a head and there were no visible toes) and landed on the steaming, hot embers, he couldn‚Äôt look away.

Phillip SCREAMED and just then the room was empty again. His heart raced. From the safety of his bed he searched every corner, every crevice, every shadow, but found nothing in every place; whatever he saw was gone or never was. He no longer shivered. He checked his breath- no more mist. It wasn‚Äôt cold anymore.

*A nightmare. It was a nightmare.*

Once sleep had worn off and he got his wits back about it him he realized the obvious truth: something that HORRIBLE could never be real.

He pulled himself back under the covers and lay his head on the pillow, and, reassured that the nightmare at the foot of his bed was just that, he fell once again into the inky blackness of sleep. Did he hear, somewhere far off, miles above him, back in his bedroom, the bits in the glass *clink-clink-clink*\-ing or was that just some indistinct childhood memory passing by him?



V.

The sun felt good on his face. It was the kind of sunshine that warms you inside the house and at the same time congeals that top layer of snow outside the house, making everything outside shine with that slick, wintry, Christmassy glow. That pleasant warmth woke him up, drove the events of the night before far, far, far away, and put him immediately at ease. *Today will be a wonderful day*, it seemed to say, as it caressed his cheek and eyelids. Even with his eyes closed Phillip knew what it would look like out his window: the cars, sidewalks, yards, rooftops, and trees would all be white and shiny and slick and cold and wonderful. That was the delicious duplicity of The Sun: it was bright enough to show you how frozen it was outside, and gave the snowfall a polished layer of finality without melting anything at all.

If Phillip was up before his father, he could have a look (and maybe even go outside) to bask in the snowy wonderland. He had to sneak these exciting moments of joy, before his father woke up and pulled and shaped the world around him back to one of cruel, claustrophobic, Christmas-less misery. ¬†

Phillip opened his eyes.

He was shocked to see his visitor from last night, floating at the foot of his bed, bathed in that same sunlight that awoke him, real as real can get. Seeing the wraith in the light of day was much worse. Under the cover of night, Phillip could make himself believe that what he saw was a vision, a nightmare, a product of a troubled mind; and he couldn‚Äôt make out all the repulsive details which were now laid bare before him so clearly- the splinters in the bones, the decayed threads of the red robes from an age that no longer was, the dull nauseating glow that permeated the far-beyond-rotten corpse of a creature, the hot embers for eyes which seemed to look in all directions and no directions at once--

Again, Phillip found it impossible to move. The fear within him and without him was all-encompassing, save for the little room it left for him to feel ill.

After what may have been a split second or the entire winter season, the creature shifted its head just slightly and in a crude manner; it made clear that it wished Phillip to look down to where one might expect a hand to be. The movement of the skull almost succeeded in making Phillip vomit; seeing the phantasm was disorienting in itself, but there was something so unnatural to its movement that it made him feel seasick.

Phillip‚Äôs eyes traced down over the rotted decay of the crimson former-fabric, to the remnants of a humerus, and, following that, a radius and ulna (which were held together by whatever was causing the dull supernatural glow). Within the grasp (if one could call it that) of the gnarled, ancient skeleton claw, Phillip saw a disjointed block of ice containing something red or orange (maybe frozen meat, it was hard to tell, whatever the creature held did not glow in the way the creature did). Phillip was unable to make out what it was.

The creature registered Phillip‚Äôs confusion. It held the object up, outstretched in front of him, to give the child a closer look. The weight of the object was obvious (although the creature had no issue lifting and holding it- its supernatural strength was unquestioned). Now the light shone through the ice and Phillip was able to see his father‚Äôs frozen head, viciously torn from its body and encased in a large block of ice, his face permanently stuck in an expression of screaming misery. Phillip remained paralyzed. Somewhere in a distant part of Phillip‚Äôs mind this horrible moment was paused forever, and he thought there was something beautiful in how the sunlight shone through the ice block and separated into its component colors, and he thought of his drawing from the night before.",2,1761424283.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I have a bunch of craft malts from Hogarth malts, and about 5lbs each of roasted barley and flaked barley from a few years ago.  I'm thinking of a not quite dry, not real sweet just down the middle stout.  Maybe something a little thicker at 8%, maybe an easy drinker around 5%.

I have a bunch of fuggles and EKG I'll be using.  Base malt will be Gambrinus ESB malt.  10 gallon batch.  

Here is a rough recipe off the top of my head.

25lbs ESB
4lbs roasted barley
5 lbs flaked barley
1 lb crystal malt of some kind
1lb chocolate malt
8 oz light chocolate
8 oz coffee malt

40 IBU of fuggles and EKG at 60
20 IBU of fuggles and EKG at 10

2 packs of Escarpment dry ale yeast

Any suggestions here?  Would like to see some recipes linked if you have some favorites.  Also have been thinking about maybe just a lightish easy drinking stout at 5%, then in a couple weeks brewing maybe a 5 gallon batch at 11% boiling for 3 hours or so.  What have you guys got?

Grinding the beans, it felt like a while.  
The steam from the espresso, a comforting haze.
Plan to compromise, plan to escape the misconduct at bay. 
But darkness loomed close, casting shadowy ways.  
The group to negotiate.
Was no laughing matter.
Group at the table, their whispers conspiratorial,  
Unknown cloaked people in a plot so diabolical.  
I poured their dark roasts, with a trembling hand.  
Unaware of the fate that was slowly at hand.  
Then thunder cracked loud, glass shattered in flight.  
A gunman‚Äôs cruel laughter drowned out the night.
No reason, no shame.
Shots rang like broken glass, the air thick with dread.
As destruction erupted, the caf√©..turned red.  
I ducked behind counters, my heart in my grasp, I almost bled out.  
Every heartbeat a question, wishing I could float.  
A betrayal unseen, a hit on the run,  
In a world filled with darkness, I was lost & misled in an environment that was suppose to be tamed.
Survival instinct dug deep.
To rise from this horror, I‚Äôd cut a chandelier free. 
Poured oil & set it to flames. 
Shadows & echoes guided my feet,  
I escaped through the back, a pulse on repeat.
Through alleyways hidden, I felt the cold breath. 
Chased by the very people who whispered my leave.  
Plans in my pocket, survival a must,  
Find refuge in safety, in hope I trust.  
Each turn felt like chance, the moon carved my path.  
Comebatting danger was a struggle. I‚Äôd challenge their wrath. 
But fire did it for me. 
Then silence poured over. As a warm heavy fog swept over.
We found solace in shadows, within the bark of the fog.
From barista to survivor, my tale unfolded,  
In a world of betrayal, where loyalty molds.  
With each cup of coffee, I remember that night
that got filled with dread
& despair.  
Every sip holds a lesson, when darkness goes out, find light out of sight from dangerous foes.

Prepping for NEET PG (and perpetually fighting procrastination).

I love reading romcoms, horror, and fiction in general ‚Äî though I‚Äôm trying to get into more non-fiction lately. Currently reading The Mountain Is You.

Shows I love: Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Modern Family, HIMYM, 2 Broke Girls, Gilmore girls, Downton Abbey to name a few.

I‚Äôm not very talkative (nothing much happens when you‚Äôre home all day), but I‚Äôm a good listener.

Mental health is something I really value and try to take care of.

I‚Äôm looking for honest, kind, empathetic, and emotionally available people ‚Äî the kind who aren‚Äôt afraid to show vulnerability or talk about real things. (Still waiting to meet a man who yaps, though üò≠).

I don‚Äôt see any way I can marry my boyfriend (even though I love him dearly) without telling him the truth about my desires and actions over the past year. The whole story starts about 10 months ago. I am Emily, a 20 year-old nursing student. My boyfriend Jake is 29, and I love him. I want to make a life with him, but I have discovered things about myself that I never knew existed.

I was a virgin before I met Jake, and I was still very inexperienced up until this past year. I enjoyed sex with Jake and thought that it was everything that it was supposed to be. That was true until I met Martin. Martin is the black man who absolutely rocked my sexual world. I first meet Martin in one of my nursing classes. I had seen him around in other classes, but I had never taken any particular notice of him until this one class where he sat directly in front of me. You should understand that I had never even thought about sex with a black person. It just didn‚Äôt register as an option with me, and besides, I had a perfectly good white boyfriend whom I loved. But I first began to notice Martin when I smelled his cologne. He was tall with very broad shoulders and close-cropped hair. Every time we had class, I noticed that I was attracted to his appearance and also to his delicious smell. One day he turned around in his seat and introduced himself. He had missed a class and wondered if he might copy my class notes. We agreed to meet for coffee after class and let him make copies. So we had coffee and we hit it off immediately. I noticed that he was reading a book that I had recently read, and we began to notice that we had a lot of the same interests.

I guess most of this is a blur to me now, and I cannot explain it, but one day Martin invited me to his apartment for a study session, and right in the middle of studying for a test, he kissed me. I still remember how that first kiss took my breath away. I was mesmerized by his sexiness, and although I was totally unprepared for anything to happen, our hands began to explore each other‚Äôs bodies, and soon we were in the bedroom‚Ä¶.naked on the bed. His body was awesome. His dark skin was beautiful and his teeth were incredibly white. I gasped when I first saw his penis. It was the far bigger than Jake‚Äôs, and as I put my hands around it, it grew to full attention. The purplish-black head was just aching to be licked, so I took it in my mouth. There is no way that I could get that entire thing in my mouth, but I swirled my tongue around it and pumped the shaft with my hands. It felt very natural to me.

By this time my shaved pussy was drenched with my juices, and I could see the desire in Martin‚Äôs eyes as he rolled me onto my back and pushed my legs apart. I can‚Äôt begin to describe the deliciousness I felt when he first slipped the head into my dripping slit. My ass instantly began to buck as I urged him to bury that cock in me as far as it would go. As I said earlier, I had always enjoyed sex before (even though I was relatively inexperienced) but this was a whole new world. This exotic experience of actually fucking a black man, something strange and seemingly forbidden to me, was a reality now, and when I came it was the most life-changing thing that I had ever experienced. That first time my vagina actually bled a little from the size of Martin‚Äôs cock, but all I felt was pleasure.

Over the next several weeks, we would frequently sneak off to Martin‚Äôs apartment (even skipping classes sometimes) just to make love. He loved eating my pussy, and his tongue would send me into orbit. I guess he fucked me in every position imaginable and then started over and did them again. Since I am on birth control, we never worried about condoms, and I would sometimes leave his apartment and go home with his cum dripping out of my slit. I loved the feeling of it soaking my wet panties.

Of course I continued my relationship with Jake as usual. I loved him. He was the man I wanted to have a life with, but Martin‚Ä¶Martin was just so damned sexy, and he was like a narcotic. I could not get enough of him. When I was away from him, I was fantasizing about him and his big hard cock. Even when Jake and I would have sex, I could not help but dream that it was Martin‚Äôs big hands on my breasts and Martin‚Äôs lips on my clitoris, and especially Martin‚Äôs cock slamming into me with a need that defies description.

Well, as they say all good things must come to an end. Jake did not find out about Martin. Martin moved to Canada to be close to some family. I cried so hard when he told me that he was leaving. I was so addicted to the sex, that I could not imagine what I would do. But eventually, I realized that it was just sexual attraction between us, and after one last session of fucking and sucking that should probably be listed in the Guinness Book of World Records, Martin was gone.

Although I was still quite happy with my relationship with Jake, I soon began to take notice of other black men that I would encounter. Alton was a heavy-set black man who worked as campus security. It took me about 30 minutes to seduce Alton and persuade him to join me for a love-making session in a hotel room. I swear, Alton had the prettiest black cock that I have ever seen, even bigger than Martin‚Äôs had been, but by that time I had been stretched enough to take even his enormous cock. Alton liked to spank me a little before we would fuck. I don‚Äôt know why black men get so turned on about spanking a white girl, but they do. I loved the feel of his big black hands and they would sting my little ass cheeks. I know they say that most black men prefer big asses (mine certainly isn‚Äôt), but Alton seemed absolutely fascinated with my ass. He also loved to pull on my nipples as he fucked me from behind‚Ä¶doggystyle. Like Martin, Alton knew just how to make me cum and cum and cum until I was absolutely sated. We kept up our secret relationship for several months until he got engaged to another white woman, one who coincidently did have a very big ass.

My third adventure happened in the library. He was also a black man, a janitor. I caught him looking at me one evening as I was doing some research for a paper, and as he peeked at me from behind a bookshelf, I slowly spread my legs and let him get a good look at my panties. In very short order, we were in an alcove and I had his prick out and was sucking it like a starving baby nursing its mother. His name was Garrison, and he was originally from some African nation, but he spoke very precise English, and he knew how to eat pussy like a pro. Garrison and I would meet at the library after hours (he had the keys and did the cleaning), and he would lie on his back naked on the floor and I would straddle him and ride his cock until I would almost scream with delight. I loved the feel of his hot cum spurting into me. Garrison was the first to try anal sex with me. His manhood was not quite in the same category as my other two black lovers had been, but compared to Jake‚Äôs, he was still rather long and thick. It took us several tries and a considerable amount of lube before we were completely successful, but before long I was not only enjoying having a black cock in my ass but was dreaming about two at the same time‚Ä¶.one in my pussy and the other in my ass.

Through all of this, I have never breathed a word to my boyfriend. As I said, I love Jake, and I want to be with him‚Ä¶to have a life with him. But I have discovered some things about myself that make that very difficult. I am addicted to big black cock. I love it. I want it. I cannot live without it. I don‚Äôt yet know how I will ever be able to break the news to him. In a perfect world, he would love me for myself and understand that I have needs that must be satisfied. I am unwilling to go through life only having sex with one man. I just don‚Äôt think that is an option. I masturbate at night imagining that I am sucking and fucking black cocks. I daydream in class about big black men raping me. I cannot help the way that I am. So, for now, I just keep my mouth shut and keep my eyes open for my next black lover.-- Emily",0,1761423473.0,cheating_stories,4,0.17,False

That is, more or less, the view that the White House adopted during the first year of Trump's second term: Making stuff in America matters, and the best way to encourage more production in America is to make it more expensive to import anything made somewhere.  
  
Of course, there are two major flaws with that logic. First, there are things that can't be made in America‚Äîor can't be made here in sufficient quantities to satisfy Americans' demand. Coffee, chocolate, bananas, and many other agricultural products, for example.  
  
Second, making things in America often requires importing raw materials or intermediate goods. More than 50 percent of all American imports are unfinished goods that are used to make other things, from cars to houses to industrial pumping equipment and chocolate bars. If all those materials are suddenly more expensive, it becomes harder, not easier, to manufacture more things here.""

My wardrobe is effectively entirely monochrome black, I dress with sort of a metalhead lite aesthetic. [Picture!](https://ibb.co/ynZ6r8v2) (DM me if picture auto-deleted and I will send you one)

In terms of personality, I'd describe myself as rather introverted, reserved, laid back, and easy going. Perhaps too easy going at times, which is a reason I might be attracted to dominant women. While I can enjoy going out and doing things like going to museums or concerts, I'm typically pretty happy doing things at home or otherwise low key. If you're familiar with the enneagram, the enneagram 4w5 is a pretty accurate description of me.

My hobbies and interests fall on the geeky/intellectual/brainy side generally. While I enjoy lifting weights, swimming, and taking care of my body, I also really enjoy reading, writing, tabletop games like RPG's or miniature games and board games. I *really* like science fiction, but also enjoy fantasy and other genre fiction. Careful getting me to talk about things related to outer space or Star Wars, because I can talk endlessly about those things. My favorite book is *Frankenstein* by Mary Shelly, and my favorite movie is *Blade Runner*, with *Star Wars Rogue One* a close second. I also enjoy being outdoors, like camping, hiking and going to the beach. Going on road trips to go camping or hiking is a way I enjoy spending my summers. My taste in music *almost* exclusively metal music or some variety therein, but with some EDM/Synthwave and am able to appreciate other genres. I do also like video games, anime, and manga, but they aren't a huge or majority aspect of my interests.

I really enjoy learning things as well. I like to watch documentaries and absorb information from all over the place, I may or may not annoy you with my constant supply of facts of dubious relevance at times. I have particular interests in astronomy (or anything to do with outer space), technology, history, philosophy and spirituality.

In the bedroom, I am an absolute submissive. I don't have any desire to be dominant, any experience I have being dominant was generally just me being dominant for my partner's sake. I get the most pleasure from knowing I'm wanted, and that I'm doing what my partner wants. I really enjoy being told what to do and feeling like I'm completely powerless compared to my partner. I like things like orgasm control/denial, teasing, edging, giving oral, pegging/anal play, having my hair played with, femdom handjobs (or handjobs in general), breast worship, obeying women, serving women, worshiping women. I'd really like to have a partner who would let me devote myself to making their life easier and spoiling them and serving them and in turn they spoil and dote on me with love, affection, attention and of course lots of sex. I also have a pretty high libido.

I think it's the correct order of things for masculinity to be submitted to femininity, and I find nothing more attractive than a powerful woman. I guess in the grand scheme of kink I'm probably more on the vanilla side and less freaky, but I'm also open minded. My [BDSM test results](https://bdsmtest.org/r/nCAp8Jrq)

My favorite kinds of romance involve a higher status woman with a lower status male, like a noblewoman and servant or knight, or powerful executive and her assistant. I really like powerful women and want to serve one and be adored by one.

I do not enjoy being degraded/humiliated, or having extreme pain inflicted on me (some light pain is fun though, I *really* like having my hair pulled). I am also a strict monogamous- I want a partner who I can give my exclusive devotion and attention to, and expect to be the sole recipient of my partner's affection. I can be rather fiercely possessive and protective of my partner.

Dating me would consist of long conversations over coffee and drinks and walks, trips to museums or parks or nature reserves of some kind, road trips to go camping and hiking, long conversations late into the night about whatever we each find interesting, or lazy days together watching movies we've already watched a million times before. But I'm also down to do whatever would make you happy, and am happy to let you lead the way.

I'm looking for a partner who enjoys having power and being in control and doesn't mind my more passive, laid back nature. Someone I can trust to lead the way and set the pace of our relationship, that I can follow and know they will take care of me as I do my best to take care of and support them. I'm looking for a partner who is smarter/more intelligent than me (I love it when a woman makes me feel like an idiot, honestly), older than me (doesn't matter how much older, just older than me, even if only a little bit), with compatible interests and kinks as mentioned above, and hopefully>!has large breasts and/or a thicc or slightly chubby body type, absolutely drives me wild with desire. !<

I'm in no rush to get into anything serious althought that is the goal. I'd really like to be able to take it slow and take our time getting to know each other and working our way up to something. Ideally, you're in the Chicago area or close by or willing to move to the Chicago/Midwest Great Lakes for the sake of something to make it real. But I'd also love to talk to any domme's whose interest I pique with this for something longer distance, but that may end up being something more fun/casual than serious on account of distance.

Gosh, this ended up being much longer than I expected it to be, but it's pretty hard to sum oneself up no matter how much text you have. In any case, I'll be an open book to any woman who messages me and I look forward to seeing what comes of this!

Also, please forgive my sparse reddit history- I'm more of a lurker by nature on the internet.",2,1761423307.0,flrdating,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm repainting most of the walls and ceilings in our house‚Äîcurrently all kind of midtone, yellows.  I‚Äôm going for light off whites.  I know I‚Äôll need to prime.  The trim is currently BM Decorator‚Äôs White, and if it wasn‚Äôt SO cool I‚Äôd likely just paint the walls the same color.

The problem is that all the warmer off whites I like for the walls clash with the purple cool tones of D‚ÄôsW.  and honestly, I‚Äôve always thought the trim was too stark against the warm dark floors.  So my dilemma is do I:

1.	‚Å†‚Å†bite the bullet and change trim color to something warmer like white dove or cloud white, or even Swiss coffee and then just use that same color in a different sheen for walls (to keep look seamless and hopefully save time)

OR

2) keep trim as is (save time?) and just try to find a paint color that works with the cool white (and possibly not like result)

Main concerns are the extra time it will take to paint trim‚Äîthough I‚Äôm curious about time possibly saved not having to tape all the trim if they‚Äôre the same color, just different sheen.  (If that‚Äôs even a correct assumption). Would not taping balance out the extra time required to paint the trim?

I guess to summarize‚Äîis color washing a time saving technique?  Especially if it‚Äôs instead of all that taping?  Oh, trim was painted about 10 years ago, in decent shape, but needs some touching up and I‚Äôd need to paint some doors.",2,1761423292.0,interiordecorating,1,0.76,False

The dad leans toward the speaker and says he wants twenty Egg McMuffins. The lady on the other end doesn‚Äôt say anything for a second, like she‚Äôs not sure she heard him right. She asks again and he says yeah, twenty, sounding proud of it. He looks over at Noah with this smile like they‚Äôre about to do something important.

They pull up to the window and the worker hands them this huge paper bag that‚Äôs hot and greasy. The dad holds it like a prize. He tells Noah that today they‚Äôre going to do some good, that they‚Äôre going to hand out food to people who need it. He calls it their ‚Äúmission of kindness.‚Äù Noah just kind of looks at him and nods, like okay, sure.

They leave the suburbs and start driving into the city. The trees and tidy lawns turn into cracked sidewalks and old buildings with graffiti. The dad turns the radio down and looks out the window like he‚Äôs hunting for people. He spots a man sitting by a bus stop and says, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs one.‚Äù He slows down, rolls down the window, and tosses a sandwich. The guy catches it, a little surprised, and gives a small wave. The dad grins and says, ‚ÄúSee? That‚Äôs all it takes.‚Äù

The bag rustles in the backseat. They keep driving and the dad keeps handing them out. He‚Äôs getting into it now, kind of talking as he goes. He says stuff like, ‚ÄúMost people just look away,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe world doesn‚Äôt make it easy, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt care.‚Äù He‚Äôs half talking to Noah, half to himself. Noah doesn‚Äôt really say anything. He just watches the people, how some smile, some don‚Äôt, some just stare like they don‚Äôt know what to make of it.

After a while, the bag is almost empty. The car smells like egg and cheese and coffee. The dad‚Äôs voice is starting to sound like he‚Äôs giving a speech. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbeing good isn‚Äôt about money. It‚Äôs about seeing people. It‚Äôs about empathy.‚Äù Noah‚Äôs eyes stay on the window.

Finally there‚Äôs one sandwich left. The dad turns off the radio and says, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make this one count.‚Äù They spot a man sitting alone on the curb beside a shopping cart full of bags. Noah rolls down the window and throws, but it hits the ground. Without saying anything, he opens the door and gets out.

The dad leans forward in his seat, a little nervous, saying, ‚ÄúHey, maybe just‚Äî‚Äù but Noah‚Äôs already walking. He picks up the sandwich and hands it to the man. They talk quietly. The man says he‚Äôs been there about a year. Noah thinks for a second, then says, ‚ÄúYou can come stay with us if you want.‚Äù

The dad freezes mid-sip of his coffee. ‚ÄúNoah, uh, no, we can‚Äôt,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe house is full.‚Äù Noah turns back and says, ‚ÄúOne of the rooms just has your Bowflex.‚Äù The dad doesn‚Äôt say anything.

A minute later, the man is sitting quietly in the back seat, unwrapping the sandwich. Noah turns and hands him the dad‚Äôs coffee from the cup holder. The man hesitates, then takes it and nods. The dad watches them in the rearview mirror, his face blank.

The car hums on. The dad takes a slow breath and keeps driving. No music, no speech, just the sound of the road and the man quietly sipping. They drive on in silence.",1,1761423158.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
