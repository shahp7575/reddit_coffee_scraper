1jlq1yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1jlq1yi/wellamoon_sleep_patch_does_it_actually_help/,Wellamoon Sleep Patch: Does It Actually Help?,"I‚Äôve always struggled with **falling asleep and staying asleep**. I‚Äôd either toss and turn for an hour before finally dozing off or wake up multiple times a night. Melatonin pills helped sometimes, but they often left me **groggy and sluggish** in the morning.

I started looking into **sleep patches** and found the **Wellamoon sleep patch**, which claims to gradually release ingredients through the skin instead of all at once like a pill. It sounded different from anything I had tried before, so I decided to test it for a full month.

Here‚Äôs what happened.

# What Is Wellamoon Sleep Patch?

The **Wellamoon sleeping patch** is a **transdermal sleep aid** that delivers ingredients through the skin over several hours. Instead of relying on digestion, the patch works **slowly and consistently throughout the night**.

Each **Wellamoon sleep patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** ‚Äì Helps regulate the sleep-wake cycle.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** ‚Äì A natural herb known for relaxation.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** ‚Äì Traditionally used to improve sleep quality.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** ‚Äì Supports muscle relaxation and nervous system balance.

To use it, you **apply the patch to a clean, hairless area** like the **forearm, thigh, or shoulder** about **an hour before bed**. It stays on overnight and is removed in the morning.

More details on the product: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Night ‚Äì Did It Work Right Away?

I didn‚Äôt expect much the first night, but I followed the instructions and placed the **Wellamoon sleep patch** on my shoulder. At first, I felt nothing, but after about **30 minutes**, I noticed a sense of **calmness**.

I fell asleep **in about 20 minutes**, which is much faster than usual. More importantly, I **stayed asleep longer** and didn‚Äôt wake up as often.

By the next morning, I felt **more refreshed than usual**, which surprised me. There was **no grogginess**, unlike the effect melatonin pills often had on me.

# Week 1 ‚Äì Getting Used to the Patch

By the end of the first week, I noticed:

* **Falling asleep was easier and more consistent**.
* **I woke up fewer times during the night**.
* **No next-day drowsiness**, which was a huge improvement over melatonin pills.

The **slow-release system** seemed to be making a difference. Instead of a big dose of melatonin hitting my system all at once, the **Wellamoon sleeping patch** worked steadily throughout the night.

# Weeks 2-3 ‚Äì A Noticeable Difference

By the second and third weeks, I started noticing **deeper sleep**. My body felt like it was settling into a **more natural sleep rhythm**, and even on nights when I didn‚Äôt use the patch, I was falling asleep **more quickly** than before.

A few key things stood out:

* I felt **more energized in the mornings**, even with fewer hours of sleep.
* My **sleep felt deeper**, and I woke up **less frequently**.
* My **mood and focus improved**, likely because I wasn‚Äôt dragging through the day from bad sleep.

# Week 4 ‚Äì Long-Term Effects

By the fourth week, I felt like my **Wellamoon sleep patch routine** had made a real difference. My sleep cycle was more **consistent**, and I no longer needed the patch **every single night** to fall asleep easily.

Some things I noticed after a month:

* My body had **adjusted to sleeping better overall**.
* I was **naturally waking up at the same time each morning**.
* I didn‚Äôt need **multiple cups of coffee to function throughout the day**.

If you‚Äôre considering it, here‚Äôs where I found mine: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patch Details**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?uid=34563&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# Pros and Cons of Wellamoon Sleep Patch

**What I Liked:**

* Helped me **fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer**.
* **No grogginess in the morning**, unlike many melatonin pills.
* **Easy to use**‚Äîjust peel and stick.
* **Gradual absorption** prevented sudden wake-ups.

**Things to Consider:**

* It‚Äôs **not an instant fix**‚Äîit took about a week to really notice a difference.
* If applied to the **same spot too often**, I noticed **mild skin irritation**.
* **Not a cure for severe insomnia**, but great for light-to-moderate sleep issues.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is Wellamoon Sleep Patch Worth Trying?

For me, **Wellamoon sleep patches** helped me:

* **Fall asleep faster**.
* **Stay asleep longer**.
* **Wake up feeling more refreshed**.

It wasn‚Äôt a **dramatic overnight change**, but over time, my **sleep quality improved significantly**.

If you have **mild to moderate sleep issues**, it might be worth considering. Has anyone else tried **Wellamoon sleeping patches**? Would love to hear other experiences.",1,1743149059.0,HealthProductsNatural,0,1.0,False

1jlpu2h,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNvhXIvYVa8,Sharing Youtuber Lightproton‚Äôs Review of the Service Industry DLC,"Here‚Äôs what Lightproton explores in the review:

‚úÖ Shopping Malls Revolutionize Retail

With the Service Industry DLC, Capitalism Lab transforms retail businesses. Players can now build shopping malls that house multiple stores under one roof, increasing foot traffic and boosting revenue‚Äîbut also introducing fierce competition. Strategic location planning is more crucial than ever!

‚úÖ Service Firms Add New Synergies

Coffee shops, fast food joints, pizzerias, and cake shops are no longer just side businesses‚Äîthey now play a key role in boosting sales for nearby stores. Place them wisely to maximize profits and create powerful business synergies.

‚úÖ Logistics as a Profit Center

Logistics, import, and export companies are now core components of gameplay. Freight is no longer just a cost‚Äîlogistics companies can generate revenue. Efficiently manage supply chains, secure rare resources via import companies, and sell excess production to export clients for global trade opportunities.

‚úÖStrategic Use of Knowledge Points

A new mechanic forces players to choose between investing knowledge points in technological growth or using them for lucrative import/export deals. This adds a new layer of decision-making to the gameplay, requiring careful planning for long-term success.

‚úÖ Mixed-Use Real Estate Expansion

Retail and real estate now overlap, as apartment and commercial buildings can house retail spaces. This introduces new challenges and opportunities: balance rent revenue with retail sales for maximum profitability!

‚úÖ New Products and Supply Chains

Service firms can now sell delicious items like cappuccino, hamburgers, Parma pizza, and strawberry cake, but these require complex supply chains involving farming, livestock, and food processing. Planning supply chains effectively is critical to avoiding financial pitfalls.

**Conclusion:**

The new Service Industry DLC extends Capitalism Lab into a more complex, competitive, and engaging business simulation. With shopping malls, service firms, logistics, import and export companies, as well as retailing integration into real estate, the gameplay now demands more strategic thinking. Retailing synergies have become a more focal point, and managing business expansion requires a careful balance of supply chains, trade deals, and competitive positioning.

1jlpril,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jlpril/the_silent_glaze/,The Silent Glaze,"I‚Äôve been a night owl, whole my life. But it got worse since I shifted to Bengaluru. 12 am coffee run became a routine. This was the time when I got some alone time to myself for thinking, brainstorming, or just being idle, enjoying¬†*‚ÄúHotel California‚Äù*. Such a lovely song...

My day starts from 10 am in the morning, it takes no pause throughout the day.

However, one fine night, I was on my usual coffee run. The Third Wave at Koramangala 4th Block provides takeaway till 3 am, which is around 1.5 km away from my rented apartment.

Weather was good as always, the thing that everyone loves about Bengaluru. But since it was around 2:30 am, there was no traffic as well.

While walking the streets of Koramangala, and enjoying the songs in my earphones, I noticed an old couple, sleeping peacefully on the footpath.

They occupied my mind for a couple of minutes. I went on a thinking spree.  
The oldies were sleeping very peacefully, like babies. Their faces had a sense of comfort. No sign of stress. I don‚Äôt remember when was the last time I slept this peacefully.

I noticed their clothes.  
It felt like they came from a normal family background. Their clothes and uncle‚Äôs watch suggested the same. But maybe something bad happened to them, probably victims of some bad situation. Otherwise, who would want to sleep on the footpath¬†*avain*?

I was curious. I wanted to understand their situation. But they were sleeping and my mind was running at the speed of a drifting Porsche, thanks to cappuccino. I had a lot of things to work on after returning home.  
I moved on to my own set of problems.

Days passed.  
I kept seeing them often during my late-night walks or coffee runs.  
Every time I saw them, they used to be asleep at different corners of the streets.  
I wanted to do something for them. At least my heart felt to do. But I failed.  
Every time I moved on to my own personal adventures after minutes of curiosity, mixed with empathy and guilt, which became normal after a couple of minutes past turning to my house lane.

Life continued. I kept on having late-night walks... Sometimes at 1 am, sometimes 2, sometimes even 4.  
Sometimes, I sighted them. Sometimes, I didn‚Äôt.

I didn‚Äôt mind their absence when they were not present, to be honest. But I felt good whenever I saw them.  
At least they didn‚Äôt leave each other at such a hard time. They were there for each other. It‚Äôs hard to see this with our generation, sadly.

One fine morning, at around 6 am - oh yeah. I didn‚Äôt sleep... It was the weekend. I wanted to take some time for myself‚Ä¶¬†*So I didn‚Äôt sleep.*

I sighted them again. But this time, they were awake.  
Possibly just woke up. Uncle was sitting near the pillared wall with the support of the boundary wall and aunty was wrapping up the cloth in which they used to sleep, trying to keep it in the old woven bag.

Uncle and I shared seconds of glance to each other when he actioned something to me, tapping his watch.  
I got confused.  
Then he asked again - ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the time?‚Äù with his grumpy voice, while tapping at his watch again.  
I was in a slight confused and shocked state, but I told him the time after looking into my watch - ‚Äú6 am, sir.‚Äù

He answered¬†*‚Äúok‚Äù*, with his grumpy voice.  
I didn‚Äôt dare to look back, and I kept walking.

I was shocked because - He spoke English really well. It gave me more confidence in my assumption that they were from a well-to-do background, but something bad had happened to them.

I wanted to talk to them and understand. But this time, I didn‚Äôt dare to. I was skeptical. I moved on again to my favorite South Indian breakfast place named¬†**Sri Krishna Sagar**¬†and served myself fresh hot filter coffee and dosa. The way I love.

Months passed. Sometimes, I sighted them. It became normal to me.

Personally, I was going through a rough patch. My mind wasn‚Äôt stable much. I was traveling to a different city every few weeks, possibly in search of some peace and mostly escape.

I completely forgot about them. Honestly, I remembered them only when I sighted them‚Ä¶ But every time I saw them, I had a sense of relief.

One random night at Koramangala, at around 2 am again, I was walking the same route, and suddenly I remembered I hadn‚Äôt seen the couple for months. Wavering thoughts working at all different tangents shivered me to the core. I was filled with guilt, I had slight hope that they were fine.  
If they were fine, I should have seen them. I hadn‚Äôt seen them in months. Nowhere near Koramangala. Did they move on to some different place?

Did they go back to their home? Maybe to their normal situation?  
Are they okay?

I was filled with guilt of not doing anything for them. For being ignorant.  
And I was afraid if it‚Äôs too late to even care about them or think of doing something for them.

This is the problem with me that I have been realizing lately.

I used to be a good human, back in my childhood. I had a good mix of curiosity, empathy, will to do good, care about others, be kind, and learning capabilities.

But as I grew older - I killed my 17-year-old self, to make a space for me in this capitalist world followed by curiosity and a constant urge to create something timeless. All goals became selfish.  
I kept focusing on one problem after another, solving it, and capitalizing on it. This became my core skill, no matter what the medium is. But at the cost of losing my empathy, time, and I don‚Äôt know what else. Not complaining. I wouldn't trade this life with anything else. But I also miss the younger version of me with so much of energy, just being there for everyone.

Now I have become a lot more self-centered. Only prioritizing super closed ones. Not the world. My care boundary has reduced.

This is good and bad.

But the only thing I cared about right now is if they are fine.  
If they are alive.

And I just hope to see them again, and possibly do something for them the next time I see them. If I see them, ever again.

So within the past year I‚Äôve moved back to my hometown after getting laid off in a HCOL area around the end of my apartments lease.

Thankfully, my grandfather allowed me to move in, rent free, so that I can save up for my future. I‚Äôve been employed here for about 6 months now making about $2k/mo. after taxes and a 25% 401k contribution. 

My bills are extremely small, paying about $200/mo. for a decent car and around $150/mo. on gas. Additionally, I work in the culinary industry at a hotel so my grocery budget is essentially coffee, alcohol, and smoothies. Otherwise I eat at work or for free at home as long as I‚Äôm preparing meals for my grandfather. Besides that, my only other recurring expense is my gym membership which is about $40/mo. All in all, my spending each month is around $500-600, leaving me about $1,400-1,500 extra at the end of each month.

I‚Äôve just now gotten serious about saving my money this year. As of now I have about $1,000 in a HYSA, $2,500 in my 401k, $1,000 in a traditional IRA, $1,200 in a taxable brokerage, and about $500 in a 529. My IRA, Taxable brokerage, and 529 are all through Fidelity, with the IRA and Taxable brokerage accounts 100% in FXAIX. I have very little debt with no cc debt, $6,000 left on my car note (6% interest), and approximately $12,000 worth of student loans at 0% that are currently in forbearance.

I‚Äôm very thankful for my position and the kindness of my grandfather to help me out. I‚Äôm taking full advantage of the opportunity to spend my time with him and save aggressively. While he doesn‚Äôt charge me rent, I cook for him, clean, do his laundry, do his yard work, and also take him out to play pool whenever I can.

I understand that this position I‚Äôm in is temporary, even though I‚Äôve been told I can stay as long as I‚Äôd like. My grandfather is like a best friend and he still has quite a bit of life ahead of him. But settling down in my hometown is not something I‚Äôd like, and a move is definitely in my future. There aren‚Äôt many young people my age near me and I‚Äôd like to eventually move somewhere more urban and progressive. Also, I really enjoy working in the culinary industry and after living in one of the biggest cities in the US, I‚Äôm desperate to return to the culinary scene of a bigger city.

I‚Äôm just feeling a bit directionless right now and I‚Äôm wondering what sort of realistic goals I could set for how much I should save and when I should move on. I‚Äôm open to getting an apartment with roommates and thankfully I have close friends in nearly every major city that could assist in my search for a place to go. I‚Äôm also confident that my resume could find me employment almost anywhere as well.

Surprise surprise after the date I got a message from her, ""It was great to meet you. Please let me know if you wanna meet again"". So i said to her yeah me too. I immediately schedule another date in the weekend. She answered like 6 hours later saying ""sorry, i can't do it this weekend"", ""maybe we can meet again at Friday i think"". Like that, (we met for the first date at Friday too).

After she asked me out (but before the date), she had said that she was meeting someone for a coffee (idk if she is seeing another match).

So, in conclusion, her somewhat flat chatting tone made me doubt that she is not really into me even tho she said let her know if i want to meet again. I do find her attractive felt spark in myself. I'm serious abt her. What should I do? Am I overreacting?

I was just diagnosed with BE yesterday. The report says 2cm but they did not take a biopsy of it. There was another area of ""erythematous mucosa"" which they did take a sample of and am waiting on the results of that.

I have had GERD my entire life and have been inconsistent in taking any medicine but now feel I need to really try to make some changes - here is what I will try to do moving forward but curious if anyone has any other recommendations:

-daily PPI (20mg Omeprazole)
-no caffeine/carbonated drinks/coffee
-cut back on alcohol to only on weekends (...and maybe one beer during the week)
-ween off nicotine (currently using nicotine pouches, no cigarettes)
-try to eat earlier in the evening vs. eating and going directly to sleep 
-always sleep on the left side of my body 
-cut back on spicy and fried foods

Is this a fairly good starting point? Is there any other major things I can do? I'm also wondering if incorporating antacids before bed, at least maybe when I do eat or drink something that's slightly triggered it, is also worth incorporating?

I'm a complete petrolhead and have been living in Japan for seven years. Even though I own a car here, I was (and still am) always keen to try out how other cars drive. Every now and then, I have rented JDM cars from different outlets, sometimes just for myself, other times when mates came over from overseas. This has been both for multi-day road trips, and short one-day blasts.

Seeing as I often see posts asking where to rent cars (not necessarily on this subreddit, but in general), how to get around by car, etc, I thought I‚Äôd throw in my two cents and share some of my experiences. FWIW, these are my honest opinions, and I‚Äôm not affiliated with any of the rental/tour outlets mentioned below.

Not always the first choice for car lovers, admittedly. However, some Toyota Rent a Car outlets actually do have the GR Yaris and GR86 available for rent. I managed to rent a GR86 from them once, and, even though the GR86 is a great car, I didn't find it particularly exciting beyond what you‚Äôd expect (then again, I am mainly used to turbo/AWD cars).

Pros:

It‚Äôs probably the biggest rental car company in Japan, so you know you‚Äôre in safe hands if anything goes wrong.

Cons:

They mainly offer only standard cars, and only certain rental locations have the GR models, which might not be the most tourist-friendly spots, either. And, of course, it‚Äôs Toyota only. Additionally, the ability to communicate in English is not guaranteed.

Considering they‚Äôre pretty much the pioneers of renting JDM cars to tourists, this will be quite lengthy. They‚Äôve got different outlets across Japan, but if you‚Äôre serious about renting proper JDM machines, the Noda head office in Chiba is the place to go. I've used Noda several times in the past, without any real issues. There are some staff there who speak some English, but definitely not native-level, which can cause some delays. If you speak passable Japanese, you'll be fine.

Pros

They probably have the largest fleet of JDMs for rent in Tokyo, maybe even in all of Japan. Prices are relatively cheap (for a reason - see the cons below), but if you‚Äôre just looking to take a car out for a day or two for some photos, or just roll into Daikoku in a GTR for the 'gram, they might be worth considering.

Cons

Being in Noda, they‚Äôre not the easiest to get to and it means you‚Äôll need to travel around two hours from central Tokyo. Even if you set off early in the morning, by the time you‚Äôve finished the paperwork and actually start driving, it‚Äôll likely be around 11 AM.

Since they‚Äôre on the northeast side of Tokyo, if you‚Äôre planning to drive to Hakone to see Mount Fuji, or even just visiting Daikoku, you‚Äôre looking at a 3 to 3.5-hour drive, factoring in Tokyo‚Äôs traffic jams. Realistically, if you want to properly enjoy some quality driving in Hakone, you‚Äôd need to rent from them for at least two days especially considering the total of around six hours just getting to and from their shop.

I‚Äôve been in their cars six times now, not because I particularly like renting from them, but because my friends always seem to want to when they visit (due to the large number of JDM classics on their roster). I hesitate to say it, but my opinion is that, whilst their JDM legends ""work"", and are obviously maintained, at least to the minimum required, they are not necessarily in good shape. The first time I rented from them, I took an R34 GT-R to Haruna, and it wasn‚Äôt boosting properly. Also worth mentioning, while heading up the mountain, I spotted an FD RX-7 also rented from Omoshiro broken down on the side of the road due to overheating. Yes, it‚Äôs a rotary, so you half expect it, but the driver told me he wasn‚Äôt even pushing the car hard. I think this is to be somewhat expected, given the popularity of the business, and how much these cars are used/pushed.

If you‚Äôre planning to rent from them, I‚Äôd suggest going for the newer models, they tend to have fewer issues. These days, I usually warn my friends about from them for obvious reasons. A quick look on Google shows plenty of mixed reviews, so it‚Äôs worth considering other reviews before making a decision.

I‚Äôm sure a lot of you have heard of Fun2Drive, especially Initial D/Wangan Midnight fans out there. They‚Äôre based in Hakone and offer Hakone/Fuji driving tours. It‚Äôs a Japanese company run by Japanese staff, though I‚Äôd say about 95% of their customers are foreigners these days.

Pros

They‚Äôve got some interesting cars available for rent, including classics such as the NA1 NSX, and some rare ones like the Hakosuka (though it‚Äôs a replica), plus some fanservice specials such as the S30 Devil Z and 911 Turbo 964 Blackbird from Wangan Midnight, not to mention the main cars from Initial D. Most of the cars are decently maintained, but the last time my friend rented an Evo 10 from them, the tires were completely worn out. To their credit, we reported the tire condition to them, and they said they‚Äôd look into it ASAP. No problems or issues with this, or the cars in general during our drive.

Cons

Getting to Fun2Drive from central Tokyo is a bit of a mission. It‚Äôs either about 3 hours by train or bus, or you‚Äôll need to rent a regular car to get there. My friend and I signed up for the 2 hour tour, but since we were in a group of 8 to 10 cars, we spent a lot of time waiting for everyone to regroup. I‚Äôd say the actual driving time was probably only around 30 minutes of the 2 hours. Plus, tolls and fuel weren‚Äôt included, so we ended up paying around 40,000 yen for that 2 hour/30 minute drive. Not the best value for money, but YMMV I guess, depending on how long you book your tour for, and how many others are in attendance on the day.

Before the tour, they spent around 45 minutes showing us how previous customers had crashed their cars. While health and safety are important, it honestly took up way too much time. Also, communication wasn't easy for non-Japanese speakers, which added to the time wasted.

I didn‚Äôt know about this company until my friend from the UK who was visiting in March, and wanted to go for a drive, let me know about it. He had seen them on a YouTube video by the Speedhunters guy, so we decided to give them a try. I was a bit wary, with them being a new company, but honestly, it was a pleasant surprise. The tour guide was a native English speaker, which made things very easy for the group (all were tourists, except for me), and also spoke great Japanese.

I spent some time chatting with our guide throughout the day, and learned that they offer fully bespoke tours alongside the standard ones. Personally, I will consider this for when friends visit the next time, I think.

Pros

They have a car swap system during the tour, so you get the chance to sample various cars, depending on how many other customers are on the tour that day. This made an impression on me, as I got to try out 4 cars I had never driven before instead of just one. I guess I'd put it down to them being a new company, but the cars were in really good condition. The most surprising cars for me were the two Kei cars (Spoon S660 replica and Monster tuned Alto Works), both were complete tuner machines, which I haven't seen for rental anywhere else.

Their tour model was all-inclusive, so the price we paid was all for the day, including tolls, etc. They have a proper shop and a ""lounge"" where you do the registration, with free coffee and drinks on offer. This felt fairly premium, if compared against others, such as Omoren, where registration is done in a portacabin in a field.

Cons

They‚Äôre not located in central Tokyo, but about 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, so not terrible. The office is not in a well-known area, and was a little hard to find. Having said that, being outside of the city meant that when we departed for Hakone, we avoided any Tokyo congestion in the morning, which saved quite a lot of time.

Their fleet of cars are not as strong as some other outlets, but I was told that it will grow with time. They do offer a free pickup from the closest station, but I also think they could benefit from offering a pickup service from somewhere like Shinjuku/Shibuya station too.

They‚Äôre often seen at Shibuya and Daikoku with Liberty Walk body-kitted GT-Rs and Veilside RX-7s. If you‚Äôre into those kinds of cars, they‚Äôre definitely a treat to look at. Personally, though, I‚Äôm not fussed about driving a Liberty Walk GT-R into Daikoku, everyone there knows you‚Äôre in a rental and not your own car. But, if driving a Liberty Walk car is what you want to do, then these are definitely the people to call.

Pros

Liberty Walk and Veilside cars are the kind of rides you see on posters or in Fast and Furious, so it‚Äôs pretty cool to rent one, take a photo, and share it with your friends. But just a heads up, these Liberty Walk cars are now pretty common in Daikoku every night, with probably around 10 of them showing up just about every evening. They‚Äôre all run by these tour companies. It‚Äôs still a good opportunity to check out these crazy cars while you're in Japan, so if it‚Äôs something you‚Äôre into, you may consider this experience.

Cons

They‚Äôre very pricey, around 70-90k yen for a 3 or 4 hour drive from Shibuya, passing by some ""sightseeing spots"" and ending up parking at Daikoku for an hour. Some companies even charge the passengers as well. For the same amount of money, you could rent cars from other outlets and drive to Daikoku yourself, or even join a guided tour for a full day of driving to Hakone. If you go to Daikoku in normal rental cars, you can still take photos with the Liberty Walk cars when you are there, no one is going to stop you. If money is no object, then sure, it‚Äôs a cool experience, but from a rational perspective, could that money be better spent elsewhere? I personally think so, but I‚Äôll leave it up to you to decide.

Since these cars are so low, the suspension isn‚Äôt really set up for proper driving. If you‚Äôre a genuine car enthusiast and enjoy driving cars, the driving experience will likely disappoint you. Plus, during the tour, you‚Äôll spend most of the time stuck in Tokyo traffic, so the actual driving part isn‚Äôt all that enjoyable. In my opinion, it‚Äôs more about the look and experience than the driving itself.

Some of them just meet you on the roadside in Shibuya, which is definitely easy to get to. However, at the same time, it can cause chaos for traffic and disrupt locals, which you might not feel okay with, depending on how you feel about such things.

Overall Verdict

If it‚Äôs your first time in Japan, I would absolutely recommend going with someone who offers guided self-drive tours rather than opting for the rent-and-drive-away options (my first experience of an ETC gate in a rental car during Tokyo rush hour still haunts me to this day). Having lived in Japan for a while, I know how awkward it can be if you don‚Äôt speak the language, and the locals might not speak yours. If something goes wrong, it can easily ruin your holiday, so having a guide to help navigate things can save a lot of stress.

Unless you're already very familiar with the systems in Japan and you're heading to somewhere remote where tour companies don't offer options, I recommend going with a guide. It just makes everything smoother and less stressful. Then again, if you're all about the adventure, then just going it alone might tick your boxes.

When deciding which rental outlet to go with, it's important to think about what you're after. Are you looking to actually drive and enjoy the experience, or are you more interested in taking photos with crazy looking cars? The transportation time is also a key factor to consider since as a tourist you only have limited time in Japan. Understanding what matters most to you will help you make the best choice.

I won‚Äôt be leaving any links to the companies, as I‚Äôm not trying to promote any of them above the others, and they all have their good and bad points. Feel free to search their names on Google, you can find them easily that way.",5,1743145506.0,TokyoTravel,1,1.0,False

From what I can tell, McFarlane's TMNT will be 5"" tall and Bebop and Rocksteady will be on the bulkier side of 7"".

We've had few TMNT playsets/dios and vehicles from other companies and they're on the expensive side, $200+.

So here's my $.02. Even if McFarlane is targeting 5"" overall scale for the TMNT and core allies like Alopex and Splinter, if bigger characters are going to be on the bulky side of 7"", there's a strong rationale for vehicles and playsets scaled to fit 7.5"" bulky figures, almost the reverse of McFarlane's Batmobile being a 1/12 Batmobile seating a 1/10 or larger Batman with an oversized cockpit or Batman 66's playsets being about 1/15 to 1/18 with oversized seats for larger figures.

Size the TMNT vehicles and playsets to the biggest figures in the line (most are awfully small vehicles to start with so you can ""overscale"" a cheapskate to the mass of a Multiverse motorcycle) and conveniently they'll work with Mezco, NECA, Super7, Playmates Classics, and Lingjihun. And McFarlane can trounce EVERYONE in the TMNT space on playsets and vehicles by offering vehicles that work with everything at no more than maybe 25% costlier than Multiverse pricepoints, even with tariffs.

Being a 5 inch line will let you do 7 inch playsets and vehicles that fit maybe up to 8 inch figures when you have at least some 7+ inch characters and TMNT vehicles at a true 1/10 scale (with oversized seats) are generally the equivalent size of the 1/12ish Multiverse vehicles, because TMNT vehicles tend to be smaller than DC vehicles to start with. So a big 7 inch scale TMNT cheapskate is going to be comparable to an undersized Multiverse motorcycle or horse and fit in that pricepoint AND be justifiable because some figures will be over 7 inches tall in a 5 inch centered IDW line.

One more free tip: use Megafig pricepoints for dio pieces. Something like an IDW lair furniture set with a couch, TV, coffee table, and pizza boxes is essentially something in a Megafig box. Or Baxter Stockman's lab. You could also do Krang's various bodies at Megafig scale.

But I always thought McFarlane should have released a series of Batcomputers as Megafigs anyway. Imagine the Keaton model Batcomputer as a Megafig. Hell, a Teletraan workstation Page Punchers megafig would be eaten up by Transformers collectors. No 3D printed or specialty option could compete. You could probably get a ton of traction with TF collectors doing something like 3 inch humans, 5-7 inch TFs, and ESPECIALLY dio pieces at that $40-50 spot! Give me Optimus Prime's deathbed with the bio monitors. Just have it so I can slide out a ""statue"" Optimus and throw my Hasbro figs on it.

Folks throw shade at McF for DC figs not being ""Legends compatible"" and there's solid reasons not to be. But if there were dio pieces and vehicles for TMNT, Transformers, G.I. Joe etc. that ARE compatible with other products, I think that's a fine niche, even if it's within limits of being comic book versions. NOBODY is affordably filling much of that niche. And it's justifiable if they pair with 5 inch baseline TMNT or statues.",1,1743145065.0,McFarlaneFigures,0,1.0,False

They provide you with a map. 

I started at 9:00 and dropped the bike off in Onomichi JR station car park at 15:30. 

The trip is super easy to do in one day. I hemi-circled all islands, stopped for lunch and coffee and cycled a steady 18-20km/hr.

1jlovio,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jlovio/aita_for_barely_doing_anything_at_work/,AITA for barely doing anything at work?,"A year ago, I landed a fully remote job as a project coordinator for a MNC. The interview process was tough - behavioral rounds, a case study, and a final interview where I had to outline how I‚Äôd manage multiple projects at once. It made the job sound fast-paced, and a little intimidating.

But today, I‚Äôm sitting in my home at 10.30am, sipping coffee, staring at my calendar, and realizing I have‚Ä¶ nothing urgent to do. Again.

My first month was crazy. I set up project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined how our team updated weekly reports. My manager was impressed and called me a ‚Äúgenius‚Äù because I set up automated reminders for overdue tasks.

Then things slowed down. Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù requests.

For meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (granola) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a ‚Äútechie‚Äù for doing that. Man, I don‚Äôt even like tech that much.

Last week, a manager asked if I remembered a decision we made two months ago - I type his question into my second brain setup (saner) and had the answer for him right away. And he asked me whether I have ‚Äúphotographic memory‚Äù. Sir, I don‚Äôt even remember my friends‚Äô birthday.

Most of my time is now spent appearing busy. I keep a detailed GDoc page open during Zoom calls so it looks like I‚Äôm working hard

I schedule slack message to send later in the days, while I actually finished them in maybe, 20 minutes

Sometimes, I feel guilty about how little I actually do.

I‚Äôve picked up hobbies. I‚Äôve learned to make fresh pasta. Started decorating my house. I‚Äôve read more books this year than in the last two combined.

Every now and then, I panic that my manager will catch on and fire me during these silent layoffs, but last week, she told me I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúan incredible job keeping everything on track.‚Äù So‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll just keep doing what I‚Äôm doing...

Approached a woman at the grocery store? ""Oh she's there to shop, not get hit on by guys"" Nope, we have plans for tomorrow morning Brunch

Approached a woman at the mechanic? ""She's not there to date, she's trying to get her car fixed"" Nope, we had a lovely evening this night at the nearby bar

Asked a woman at the grocery store? ""She's not into you, it's just her job to be friendly"" Nope, got her number and I'm meeting her Sunday afternoon for Coffee

I don't know where the hell this trend of ""Don't approach women, you'll make them uncomfortable"" came from, it's bullshit. My dating life has gotten so much easier once I stopped worrying about making them uncomfortable.

Like, my self esteem was in the gutter before I decided to try this. I felt like I was doomed to rotting on the dating apps for forever, but it turns out I'd just been lied to this whole goddamn time. Just fucking smile, be nice and ask for their number, that's all it takes. And if I do make someone uncomfortable then A) that's their problem, and B) I can just walk away and end the situation. I didn't touch them, didn't make any kind of innuendo or anything. Just went ""Hey I thought you were cute and thought I'd say Hi, my name is \[redacted\]""

I don't know if this will help anyone, but basically stop worrying about crazy people and instead just take life by the reins and do it. If you're worried about being plastered on social media, just be a gentleman and polite and they won't have any ammo to use against you.

1jloq4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jloq4l/ex_f18_kept_reaching_out_but_i_m18_just_saw_her/,"Ex (F18) kept reaching out, but I (M18) just saw her with someone else. How do I move forward?","My ex (F18) and I (M18) broke up about six months ago, but it wasn‚Äôt a clean break. We had a lot of conversations leading up to it‚Äîshe said she felt emotionally neglected at times, like I wasn‚Äôt creating a space for her to feel heard. But she never clearly expressed these feelings until they built up and exploded into arguments. One day, after still acting affectionate and close, she told me she was starting to lose feelings and wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to continue the relationship. We took a break to think, but even during that time, she would reach out, unable to suppress her thoughts. It eventually ended in a mutually agreed upon breakup, though we both left the door open for a potential rekindling in the future.

And that wasn‚Äôt just something I told myself‚Äîshe talked about it too. Even as recently as a month before our last interaction, she was the one who said she could still see us trying again at some point. That gave me some sort of hope.

Even after the breakup, she would reach out randomly. But one situation in particular really confused me. We had planned to go to a concert together before we broke up, and she kept the ticket. Over a month before the concert, I messaged her telling her that if she needed the money, I had it ready to send her‚Äîunless she decided to sell the ticket, which I even recommended because she could get more money for it. But she never responded. So I assumed she blocked me or just didn‚Äôt care. Then, in the middle of the actual concert, she suddenly messaged me asking for the money. That hurt‚Äînot just because of the money but because it felt like she only reached out when it was convenient for her. As I knew she decided to sell the ticket as i checked on the website out of curoisity seeing the seat for sale which she never communicated, thinking I was in the dark. Then she asked for money when she was unable to sell the ticket herself.

Then, a few nights ago, she even called me out of nowhere a few times and requested to follow me on instagram again, but I didn‚Äôt pick up nor accept. I couldn‚Äôt see any good coming from it, and I didn‚Äôt want to open old wounds if she wasn‚Äôt going to be clear about why she was reaching out. But it kept me wondering. Did she still feel conflicted? Was she just keeping me on the back burner? I had no answers.

Then tonight happened. I was out with friends at a coffee shop‚Äîone of the places I had actually planned to take her when we rekindled. I‚Äôve been writing poetry about her, holding onto memories, and even visiting places with my friends thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring her here someday.‚Äù But instead, I saw her walk in‚Äîwith another guy. They were holding hands. She was laughing and smiling at him in the same way she used to smile at me. It felt like a gut punch. I tried to rationalize it, but it crushed me. She noticed me and was visibly distraught as my friends pointed out and as I noticed through the side of my eyes.

I know she has every right to move on. But what messes with my head is that she was still reaching out to me‚Äînot consistently, but just enough to keep me in a state of confusion. Why talk about rekindling just a month ago? Why call me out of nowhere? Why ask for money in the middle of a concert when she ignored me before?

And to add fuel, she still has our pictures on her Alt account. posts saying she misses me. pictures of her wearing the gifts i got for her.

Now I just feel stupid. Stupid for still holding onto hope. Stupid for believing her words over her actions. Stupid for wasting so much time thinking about her when clearly, she‚Äôs already moved on. At least I think so. I've gotten only more confused.

So now I‚Äôm here, wondering: How do I move forward? How do I let go of the hope that I was still clinging to? How do I accept that while I was holding onto a future with her, she was already making one with someone else?

TL;DR: My ex (F18) and I (M18) broke up six months ago, but she kept reaching out occasionally, even mentioning the possibility of rekindling as recently as a month ago. She ignored my offer to refund her concert ticket but then suddenly asked for the money mid-concert when she couldn‚Äôt sell it not knowing I knew she failed to sell it. A few nights ago, she called me multiple times out of nowhere, but I didn‚Äôt answer. Tonight, I ran into her at a coffee shop‚Äîone I had planned to take her to if we got back together‚Äîand saw her holding hands with another guy, laughing and smiling at him the way she used to with me, as she noticed me too. Meanwhile, she still has pictures of us on her alt account, posts about missing me, and wears gifts I gave her.

I feel stupid for holding onto hope and believing her words over her actions. How do I finally let go and move on if thats whats best?

Or is she still holding on?

Would my income be halal because i paid for the products upfront or do i have to have the products in my own hand to sell them (which means a fulfillment center where you send your products for them to ship it is haram aswell?)
