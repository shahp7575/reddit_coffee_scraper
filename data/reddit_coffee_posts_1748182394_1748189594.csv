I never knew my Uncle Josh very well. I’d met him on one or two occasions, at reunions where even the more elusive of distant family members show their faces. There was one in Saratoga, and another in Jersey. I can’t remember whether he was at one, the other, or both. What I do remember was what he was like. He was a quiet man. He wasn’t mean, not by a long shot, but everything he said had a weight to it with how little he talked. I think he made my other family members uneasy. I never really knew why. He was serious, sure, but he wasn’t particularly threatening. I knew he was a vet. He served in Vietnam, with distinction. He was one of the few soldiers in our family. We weren’t a band of fighters or patriots. Maybe that was it. At any rate, he passed away a few years ago. Despite our lack of real connection, he left me everything. His house, his truck, his records, everything. I had fallen on some pretty hard times when he passed. I was in danger of being evicted from my place, and living in Long Island hardly felt worth it. So, I stopped paying rent. I packed up all my belongings and went north. 
I found my Uncle’s old place a couple miles west of the Finger Lakes, in a town called Orange Springs. It was some sort of former industrial town, with big factories laying derelict on the outskirts. But it was cheap, and pretty comfortable. There was some memorabilia from his time in Vietnam tucked away in his room. Pictures, his dog tags, charms and tchotchkes he’d picked up while there. Lots of things to see and pick up. The lawyers were a bit of a hassle to deal with, but all the affairs got sorted pretty quickly. I’d been staying in the house for a few years, when I found a cardboard box I had never seen before in the basement. It was weird. There were ashes, some black feathers, and a journal. I knew as soon as I read the first couple of pages, I had to share it somewhere. So I chose here. There’s a lot written in here, so if people are interested I’ll keep going. Anyway, here’s the first couple of entries. Tell me what you make of it. 





November 12th, 1976 

There’s been a storm looming over my town for a few days. It’s November, so it typically is pretty cold this time of year. But the clouds have been the most disturbing part. The same stormfront has been almost circling overhead, only changing shape slightly. I’m no weatherman, but I don’t think that’s normal. I’ve been ignoring it, everyone has. It’s definitely got people on edge, but what would we do? We’re at its complete mercy. Everyone in this town, the grocer, the sheriff, the farmers on the outskirts, the Mennonites especially, we all know something is very wrong with the sky. We’re all just going about our business, silently acknowledging the dread this thing has produced. All we can do is watch and wait, and I think it’s eating us from the inside. Linda would’ve said it had an aura about it or something mystical like that. God damn it, I miss her. 

November 17th, 1976 

I’ve been going to the community center. The old folks in the town have been gathering there, murmuring amongst themselves. This one old lady, Mama Jess as everyone calls her, is staring at me from the corner of the room. Nobody’s quite sure how old she is or exactly where she came from. One day, she was there, and for twenty years it's been that way. Normally, she is idly reading the same book again or staring off into the fuzzy TV, seeming like she’s never quite paying attention. But today, it’s different. For once she seems alert. Awake. Afraid. Her eyes are wide and her grip on the old wooden chair she’s always planted to is shaking. 
I walk over to her, almost as if she’s calling to me. I sit next to her for a few minutes, watching as Ms. Leminster hangs paper leaves from the wall, dim light bathing the room as the elderly huddle together in anxious whispers. I’ve been coming here for three years, to try and get my mind off of everything that’s happened. The draft, the war… Linda. It helps to feel useful. To be of service to our town. But the laughter and the comradery is gone. The old men congregate not to tell stories, but to share warnings. Jess turns to me finally, having sat in silence for almost five minutes. 
“It’s come again. I never thought I’d live to see the day.” She says. She’s talking to me, clearly, but looking at her face she seems very far away. 
“What is it, Mama Jess? The storm? The rain?” I say to her, feeling a strange tension begin to root itself into my chest. 
“The storm is just a mask it wears. Something to hide away from the prying eyes of man… We ain’t supposed to know. Not then, not now, not ever.” 
“But, Jess… It’s just a storm. These things happen in autumn, y’know?” I don’t believe what I’m saying, but at this point it’s more for my own reassurance than hers. 
“No, child, no…” She almost laughs, a sad and tired sound as she actually turns to me. 
“The clouds come when they’re hungry. When the storm is gone we lay our stones and rebuild. Old dogs like me don’t run away. Nowhere to run to no more. But you, child… You’re young. Live your life free of this wretchedness. Skip town for a few days, and come back ‘round Christmas. It’ll all be over by then.” 
“Leave town? But I just got back.” Her eyes are suddenly filled with fire like I ain’t seen before, and she grabs my arm. 
“Don’t you understand, Joshua? If you don’t leave soon, you won’t leave, not ever.” Suddenly, it’s like she been sedated. She relaxes, settling back and just staring off into space again. 
“It might not matter, anyways… Orange Springs always pulls you back, no matter what you do. Watch the skies and see, child, see the feasting.” With that she is silent again. She didn't talk again today. As I write this, I can see a light on in the community center in the distance. I wonder if she’s still awake. I wonder if she’s right. 

November 20th, 1976 

A crow flew by 
It paused and saw 
The gathered winds 
The unsettled straw 

The fields they wept 
As the cattle retired 
Soon we shall hold 
A funeral pyre. 

November 21st, 1976

The Flendersons dog ran away today. The thing started whining and yipping, apparently, standing at the back door. George doesn’t know what got into him. He figured maybe he had to do his business so he opened the screen door and let him out. The dog didn’t stop at their fence. It squeezed through a gap and wriggled its way free. Then it just ran and ran into the woods until they couldn’t see it anymore. George tried to go after it but he realized it was hopeless. His kid, Ryan, is all shook up about it. Hasn’t left his room all day. Won’t eat. He’s only spoken twice since, asking the same thing: “Why?” I don’t think anyone has an answer. 

November 25th, 1976 

It happened today. Today of all days. I’ll try and write down what I remember. So much in so little time… We were gathered around a shoddy old table in the community center. We were having Thanksgiving dinner, even Mama Jess was eating. There was Turkey and Mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce straight from the can. For a moment, only a moment, I felt the unease leave me and a calm settled down in my brain. Then there was a crack, as thunder sounded somewhere in the distance. Everyone fell silent. Mama Jess began to pray, mumbling something with eyes open and watering. There was a creaking and groaning as a sudden wind was pushing hard against the worn frame of the hall, which seemed to just be pulling through. Then the building shuddered as rain came driving down in sheets, and there was another clap of thunder even closer than before. The lights flickered, struggled, and died. 
The hall was cast into darkness, and for a moment there was no sound except for the elements outside. Then the wailing started. It began at one corner of the room, from the far end of the table. I couldn’t see but I knew. Somehow I knew it was Jess. At first it was low, but slowly it got real shrill as other voices joined it. A panicked chorus of screams and cries as the now blinded congregation began to stagger through the darkness. It was so loud and chaotic I covered my ears, feeling the panic as it began to spread like a fever. People started running, I felt someone slam into my chair and I toppled over. All the anxiety and fear that had been building for weeks was now, all out once, being released into this tiny place, dark as a tomb. I tried to get up but I yelped in pain as someone stepped on my hand, I heard someone coughing and spluttering, choking on their dinner, somewhere nearby a kid was trying to find her mother. Absolute havoc. I began crawling my way to the entrance, feeling my way towards the wall. As I tried to steady myself  using the wall as support, another panicking person came and slammed into me, leaving me to topple over and with a sharp pain in my ribs. I finally stumbled to my feet and managed a painful stumble to the front door. 
Pushing with all my strength, I managed to open the solid wooden door with a shove. For a moment I just stood there, watching as the rainwater formed streams that slicked down Raleigh street and fed into the storm drains below. The rain was pouring hard, each drop like a bullet that disintegrated upon contact with the ground. I put an arm over my head to block some of the droplets that were beating against my skull like a drum. As I turned around to get a look at what was happening inside, I noticed a shape inching closer to the doorway. It was small at first, but as it drew closer I realized with a start that it was Mr. Harrison. He was in his wheelchair like usual, but pushing in such a frenzy that sweat coated his head and a thin line of drool was slipping from his mouth. I saw him coming right at me. By the time I realized what was about to happen, it was all too late. 
The front wheels struck me, knocking me backwards and down the stairs, my head rattling around as I attempted to roll into a ball. I landed on the concrete with a thump, and I yelped in agony as fresh bruises and cuts started to make themselves known. Rolling a few feet, I laid for just a moment to cope with the pain. Feeling my battered rib deeper than ever as I shambled to my feet, I looked with blurry vision and with a mix of sorrow and fear, my eyes laid on Mr. Harrison. His bald head was leaking blood down the steps, his glasses smashed in a little pile in front of him. His wheelchair lay on top of his crumpled body, dented and twisted from the fall. I had that tight feeling in my chest again, my breathing out of control. It was like the worst nights in Vietnam, a stress that ate up everything. I did what the doctor at the VA hospital told me, and I counted to three. Then, I took a deep breath, held it, and let it go. My heart was still pounding as I opened my eyes again, but I was back in the saddle now. 
Harrison was hurt, and would be dead within the hour if he didn’t get some sort of medical attention, something I wasn’t qualified for. Looking around, I caught a pay phone a few feet from the curb, weeds creeping up around the post. I ran to it, trying to call the authorities, when there was a sound like an explosion followed by a shockwave of energy that almost knocked me off my feet. My ears ringing, little shocks running up and down my spine, I turned around, feeling a sudden heat at my back. I yelled in terror when I witnessed the community center ablaze. It had been struck by lightning, and the fire was moving quick now. Even with the rain coming down the way it was, it hungrily ate away at the old building. There were screams coming from inside, it was loud enough now that I could hear it through everything else. Then the roof gave in. Timbers, at least fifty years old by this point, dropped like Lincoln logs from the roof above. Some of the screams were silenced by the falling debris, crushed under their burning weight, and others simply grew more desperate, clearly aware of exactly what was happening to them. I couldn’t do anything. I was totally helpless. I just stood there, dumbfounded by the cruelty and terror of it all. I was snapped from my stupor when I noticed Mr. Harrison was awake, trying desperately to get away from the fire.
 He was dragging himself along the staircase, one hand at a time. It was pathetic, and terrible, and I felt so utterly useless for having not helped him before now. I ran to his side, scooped him up as best I could, and took him  back to the pay phone. I tore off a piece of my shirt, and wrapped it around his head wound as best as I could. Then, I turned back to the fire, and watched as the building began almost folding in on itself. I dialed the fire department as fast as I could, and I heard a siren go off in the distance as the VFD got together to respond. I told them I had a wounded man with me, and they promised they’d bring an ambulance. Fifteen minutes later, and the trucks pulled up on the scene. They blasted that inferno with hundreds of gallons of water, hoping to douse the flames, and to their credit, the fire was out in only a few short minutes. But it was too late. The remaining firefighters ran to look for survivors, and instead recovered charred remains. When the ambulance came, I heard them calling everything they could to deal with it. More ambulances, body bags, transport trucks, everything. The firefighters didn’t fully understand how it could’ve burned so quickly. I knew, though, that this wasn’t no ordinary fire. I stared into that blackened pit, smoke rising from the ashes and the bodies they hadn’t found yet. 

“Watch the skies…See the feasting.”

 I understood then. I’m at war again, with an enemy I can’t  beat. It’ll get its way, and it will consume as many of us as possible before the sun comes back. I’m not backing down this time, though. There won’t be a surrender, and there sure as hell won't be a retreat. This is our home. And it is not welcome here. 

November 27th, 1976 

It’s been two days, and I haven’t been able to get a decent sleep. Harrison called me from the hospital. Told me he would be ok. Thanked me in a sort of empty tone, like he was elsewhere. Didn’t blame the guy. The whole town was shocked of course, but they weren’t there. They didn’t see the hell on earth that place unleashed. The rain’s hardly let up. When it has stopped, the winds have gotten stronger in its place. It’s bad, I won’t lie. It won’t win with some bad weather, though. Takes a little more than a rainy day to put me down. Hold on. Something’s going on downstairs. Jesus Christ, ok, it’s getting worse. Was writing when there was a bang coming from the kitchen. Thought maybe something slammed into the window. I was right, in a way. There was a crow that flew into my window. When I was down there, checking out what happened, another came and hit it, too. Then another, and another, and another. They broke through, eventually. 
Now I got a broken, bloody window, thirty dead crows out back, two in the kitchen, and a live one. Yeah, I was surprised to find the little guy was ok. Seems to be spooked out of his gourd though. Can’t be mad at him, though, it’s just an animal. I’ve let him sit on my counter for now. He’s been still for the last hour, only looking around every so often. I figured I might as well let him weather out the storm. The house is certainly big enough, and I could use the company. Guess I should give him a name. Can’t think of one, though. Suppose I’ll write a couple down when I’ve got ideas. 

November 28th, 1976 

Well, he’s still there. Found him when I was going down for coffee. He made a gruff kinda noise so I gave him some water in an old mug. He drank that thing down. No idea what I’m gonna do with the fella. Sometimes, when I got my back turned to him, I swear his eyes are still on me. Watching me. ‘Spose I got things easy, all things considered though. Whole town’s gone to some type of shit. There was a pileup by the ironworks today. Two eighteen wheelers hauling timber, hit a school bus. Couldn’t see each other in the driving rain. A dozen survivors, maybe, but more than enough hurt or dead to get them to shut down the schools. Shocked that they didn’t do it sooner, frankly. Sheriff’s telling people to stay indoors and batten down the hatches. Don’t let the kids out unless you’re watching ‘em, that sort of thing. All the animals have been going haywire too. 
They gotta know something we don’t, or maybe that we’re just too scared to acknowledge. The Haversam’s cat went crazy and scratched the shit out of Marylin, then ran past her into the attic. They haven’t seen it since. Jorge told me on the phone that he had to lock his dog, Mica, in the basement because she was fighting with tooth and nail to get out of the house. Never seen her so stirred up before, he said.  Herd of cows trampled a ranch hand, broke out of the pen, and caused a major traffic jam in the intersection of Lynch and Canaan street. There have been at least ten different wild animal attacks across town. The biggest Mennonite farm, Friesen’s, had an incident last afternoon. Herd of deer dashed across the cornfields, and the biggest buck of the lot rammed its antlers right into Jeb’s youngest son, Hayden. Poor kid didn’t stand a chance. Took three shots from a .308 rifle to put that thing down. It was like it was rabid, or somethin’, but it didn’t show no signs of sickness.
 People are starting to panic. Every house on my block got its windows shut, the real preppers got them boarded up. Grady must be laughing at us now. We told him he’d never use that old bomb shelter he built in ‘66. Jeb called me this morning. I helped him with a Possum problem once but we weren’t exactly close. He started off talking about the tractor, how the engine needed a new spark plug, then just started breaking down. 
“What have we done, Joshua? What have we done?” He kept saying. The Sheriff's overwhelmed. Hasn’t left his office in over a day now. Jorge told me his wife insisted something was wrong. That he was sick, or depressed, or some other affliction. I don’t know. The crow’s squawking again. He’s gotta be hungry by now. What the hell do crows eat, anyhow?

November 30th, 1976 

Poe eats corn. He likes corn, but he loves Walnuts. Been leaving little bowls of food for him. He finally left his perch in the kitchen. Found him walking around in the living room this morning. He kept staring up the chimney. Little guy was all covered in soot, so I gave him a bath. He didn’t take too kindly to that. Bit my hand, the son of a bitch. I’ve had to put up a grate around the fireplace, he’s obsessed with it. I thought maybe his wing was broken, but I was corrected this afternoon when I opted to kill some time and take a nap. As I woke up, there he was. Staring at me from on top of my door. Poe’s cute as a button, but I’ll be damned if he didn’t spook me from time to time. Hayden’s funeral is on Tuesday. I assume it’ll be an indoor service. Even the gravedigger ain’t going out in this. The Friesens are good folks. Don’t deserve something like this. 


November 30th, 1976 

This was first 
But won’t be last 
The Yard will fill
When all is past 

Follow their voices 
With them be 
Your final freedom 
Watch and See 

More poems I don’t remember writing. 

December 1st, 1976 

Ryan Flenderson is gone. Ran away last night. George is beside himself. Said he tried to stop him, but the kid just kept saying the dog was out there, in the storm. Whining, barking, yelping, making a racket in the gale. George didn’t hear a thing. There’s a search party out for him, but I figure they won’t find him. It’s the thought that  counts. Looks like the storm is feeding again. A kid, goddamnit. Ten years old. 
Sheriff’s gone too. They finally broke down his door after three days of silence. Place smelled like a sty, they said, and there he was. Sitting on his old chair, eyes rolled back into his head, looking up at the sky as if he could see it through the ceiling. His face was splotched with purple and red, his body bloated to disgusting proportions. They say he choked on something. Not sure what to believe anymore. Deputies are running around like headless chickens, now. None of ‘em know what to do. Not like I could do any better, I suppose.
 I quit my job. I wasn’t making much at the registry anyhow. Mailroom clerk. Jesus, what was I doing with my life? I feel like I’m thinking for the first time since they told me Linda passed. I wasn’t there for her when I needed to be. I wasn’t there for fuckin’ anyone. When I came home, they spit on me. War ended, life moved on. I think a part of me didn’t get on that last chopper outta Saigon. Shit. Gotta sharpen this pencil, I’ve been rambling again. I get lost in my own head sometimes. Wind’s picking up.  

I mean, holy shit! My uncle was so much more out there than I initially imagined. Had no idea he was a writer.  There’s still pages of this stuff, documenting a few month’s worth of material. I’ll post when I get the chance. If anybody can find some of his work, maybe he published it somewhere? Joshua Sommerton? I don’t know. Keep you guys posted when possible.

So I posted on Reddit, offering to show people around Chengdu — and got a lot of responses!

The other day, I showed a traveler from India around the city. We explored together for 7 hours, and by the time I got on the subway home, I was totally wiped out 😅

But he said:  
“This trip has been much better than I expected“ And that made it all worth it.

✅ **Solid Tips for Hot-Weather Chengdu Travel:**

From May to October, afternoons in Chengdu are really hot. So here’s a chill and shaded plan to enjoy the city without getting burned out:

🕒 Suggested Route:

**1. People’s Park 人民公园 🕊️** Arrive earlier to enjoy a taste of local life: tea houses, park dances, and friendly card games Great for people-watching and casual chats with locals See “marriage market” corner😂

2.**Sichuan Opera Show – Shu Feng Ya Yun 🎭 蜀风雅韵**  
Starts around 2:30–3:00 p.m.  
Indoor, air-conditioned, good start for a hot day

3. **Café Break ☕️**  
After the show, find a nearby coffee shop to relax

4. **City Walk – 5 p.m. onward** 🌇

Paotong Street + Kuixinglou Street  
Explore boutiques, snack on local treats like egg pancakes (蛋烘糕), ice jelly (冰粉), and sugar oil fruits (糖油果子) while walking.

**!! It’s totally walkable from Shufeng Yayun to Paotongshu Street and Kuixinglou Street — around 40 minutes to an hour. The scenery’s lovely, and the whole route really gives you that laid-back Chengdu feeling.**

5. **Dinner 🔥**  
Hotpot or串串 — local flavors, spicy or not, you choose

6. **Kuanzhai Alleys by Night** 🌃  
Cooler, beautifully lit, much more enjoyable than in the daytime

**Have you been craving a fresh start?**

The Gemini New Moon on May 26th is your opportunity to claim your path. The New Moon occurs at 10:02 PM CDT, Monday night for those living in the United States. The new moon will be exact at 6° and 5 seconds.

The new moon is conjunct to Mercury at 2 degrees in Gemini. Mercury is about communication, logic and reasoning and Gemini is naturally curious, flexible and quick. It's safe to say that this new moon will be about opening up new conversations, and shifting our point of view. This can be a time where many people's minds feel sharp. For many, it will feel like waking up from a daze.

And the wake-up isn't just because of the new moon and Mercury. Has a lot to do with both Neptune and Saturn now being in the sign of Aries. The fog of Pisces is melting away, but I urge you not to let the lessons dissipate. Ideally what we should have learned in the past few years is that we are part of the whole, and what impacts one group of people impacts everyone in some way. Though, it may not be until both Neptune and Saturn retrograde back into Pisces before society realizes how important each of us is to our well-being.

Let's get into the aspects because that's really the nitty gritty of the energy. Since we are discussing the new moon, let's talk about those aspects first.

The new moon is trine to Pluto in Aquarius. When the Sun is in trine to Pluto, we tend to have powerful experiences that lead us to learning about the world around us as well as how we fit into the current atmosphere. During this new moon, you may investigate how your life has played out and what reforms you need to make in order to get you on the path that is best for you. This is a great time to express yourself, have discussions with those that are close to you and ponder the big meaning of life.

You also may have an awareness and sensitivity to other people's feelings and your own emotions could be intense. The key here is to release your feelings through expression, be it in conversation or writing everything down. Just be wary of being obsessed by your thoughts. Your mind could be racing during this new moon so I recommend taking slow deep breaths, doing some movement, and maybe putting yourself in a social situation where discussion is encouraged. This is a great time for storytelling, just don't dominate the flow of information between you and others.

There is this beautiful minor grand trine that is happening between Pluto in Aquarius, Saturn and Neptune in Aries, Uranus in Taurus and Mercury and Gemini. With Pluto being sextile to Saturn, you most likely will push yourself to the limits over the next few months but the good news is that Saturn will put on the brakes if you're going too far. What this means is that the energy is there to get a lot done. All of those things that you've put off doing, now is the time.

And if you've wondered why astrology has popped off the past few years it is because we have had Pluto in sextile to Neptune since 2022. The energy between Pluto and Neptune revolves around us exploring social movements as well as looking inward and trying to figure out what values are and how we apply them in our lives. Therapy takes focus and we will continue with this energy for the next decade. With Neptune now in Aries, we can apply what we've learned the past few years to our own growth. It's a great time to set an objective on improving your own mental health.

For the next 5 years, we will have Pluto making a trine to Uranus. Keep in mind, Uranus will enter into the sign of Gemini in July but for now it is still in the sign of Taurus. For those who have taken ownership of exploring their own higher consciousness, the next 5 years will be a positive evolution leading you to greater understanding of your inner being and how you relate to everyone - including the people who do not align with you. You will be able to evaluate the parts of you that you have outgrown and be able to correct course without restrictions. I'm not going to say that this will be pain-free, but it may feel that way. There will be more people gravitating towards philosophical concerns and exploration into religious and spiritual movements.

Though Uranus encourages us to seek new thoughts and beliefs, Saturn’s sextile to Uranus allows us to have a balance between the old and the new and a sense of patience with ourselves and others. This is a great time for learning and gathering information as well as teaching. You may find yourself having new approaches to old routines, and even if you hold on to an old belief, you may see things through a different light.

Most people reading this article have a Uranus and Neptune sextile in their birth chart. We are also experiencing this sextile energy now and will have it for the next 4 years. If you've ever been wondering if you were born for these times, I hate to tell you but you probably were. The Neptune - Uranus sextile is about social change. Now I know our brains want to tell us that social change is always about progress, and though Uranus is about the future, sometimes there are steps forward and sometimes there are steps backwards. But it is the whole journey, from start to finish, that we need to go through in order to learn what it means to be both ourselves and part of society.

In my previous article, I talked about the Saturn Neptune conjunction. With that said, I just want to add a little bit to what I've previously written. This conjunction can make you feel like things are worse than they actually are because it blends Saturn's somber and restrictive viewpoint with Neptune, which makes it difficult to see things clearly. Just know if your confidence is at a low, you may be impacted by this conjunction which has been going on since February. Also with this conjunction, it is important to take care of your health and seek appropriate care.

But I need to tell you what is good about the Saturn - Neptune conjunction. The constructive part of this conjunction is that you may be attune to what your inner needs are and, due to Saturn's influence, you may **not** be led astray by illusions, even fearful ones. If you can shut off the fear, imagine what you can do with the influence of Pluto, Uranus, Mercury and this new moon. Yes you may have to make some sacrifices to get what you want but, the current energy supports gaining a greater understanding of yourself and the world around you.

Jupiter is square to Saturn and Neptune, and will emphasize the themes of the conjunction, but it will also add some optimism and enthusiasm. So if your moods are fluctuating between despair and excitement, just know that this has to do with the conflicting energies between these planets. And even though you may be dealing with uncertainty, your efforts, though they may take a while to pay off, will bring success. With Neptune in Aries, you'll know which questions to ask of yourself to get you on to your desired path.

One of the sweetest transits right now is Venus in Aries in trine to Mars in Leo. Mars has been a real thorn for most of us until recently. The Venus - Mars trine is about asserting yourself without offending others. The discussions that I mentioned in the beginning of this article can actually be productive and move relationships towards greater understanding. There's a feeling of wanting to help others without being sacrificial and accepting help yourself. It's about balancing the needs of those that you interact with with your own. And here's the icing on the cake, this aspect is putting people in a better mood and relationships in the bedroom may have an extra spark.

So let's summarize. This new moon is encouraging you to communicate with others, to connect and allow our experiences to resonate within ourselves. By doing so, we should gain clarity to move forward. This is a great time to manifest, and put your desires out into the world. With the early degrees of many of the placements, celebrate new opportunities and get excited about the future. Focus on what you want without negating the people around you. Lean into the healthy curiosity of Gemini, and with the fresh start of the New Moon, speak your truth, set your intentions, act with purpose and clarity, and forge ahead toward your destiny.

Now that we’ve explored the overarching energy, you’re probably wondering how this New Moon will impact you personally. Read on for your rising sign horoscope and get a high-level overview of what area of life is being activated.

  
**Horoscopes by Rising Sign**

These horoscopes are generated using the Whole Sign house system in Western Tropical Astrology. I highly recommend reading your rising sign first, though you may gain additional insight by reading your Sun and Moon signs as well.

**Aries Rising:**

Knock, knock, it’s time to get to know your neighbors. This New Moon energy encourages you to make connections within your immediate environment. Chat with people in your community and brainstorm ideas for local improvement. If your neighborhood is dealing with a feral cat issue, reach out to your local TNR (Trap, Neuter, and Release) organization, or start one yourself. If water is being wasted on non-native grass lawns, consider advocating for native plants through your HOA or local government.

I know this next part can be sensitive, but if you’ve had a strained relationship with a sibling, this New Moon offers an opportunity to approach things differently. It might come down to focusing on shared values instead of differences. It’s never too late to offer an olive branch. At worst, nothing changes, but at best, it could begin a journey toward healing.

**Taurus Rising:**

You tend to be deeply attuned to your values, but this New Moon may highlight the need for a tune-up in how you communicate around them. Pay close attention to the language you use when talking, or thinking, about money and personal resources. Are you speaking from a place of fear or worry? This transit invites you to shift your money mindset. If you don’t already have a budget, now is a good time to review your spending habits. And if you’re feeling dissatisfied with your current financial circumstances, give yourself permission to want more, without shame or guilt.

Have a conversation with your higher self and explore what might be holding you back. You may benefit from working on your solar plexus chakra to clear out blocks that are standing between you and a deeper sense of financial security. Keep in mind, too, that you could be holding on to things, physical or emotional, that no longer serve you and are getting in the way of what you truly desire.

**Gemini Rising:**

You’ve been riding a wave of optimism for a while, and with this New Moon in your sign, you're likely sending lots of texts and catching up on the latest news. Just be mindful of your tone. Make sure your words are encouraging and lighthearted rather than critical or gossipy. This is your time to show the world who you are in a new light, highlighting the qualities that make you unique. If you haven’t updated your look recently, this is a great time to go for that haircut you've always wanted or add new or thrifted pieces to refresh your style.

You’re encouraged to spend time with friends and may even be asked to step into a role that helps your community. If you have the bandwidth, say yes. This is also a wonderful time to network, and if you're single, you might just meet someone special while you're out socializing. So get out there and let your light shine.

**Cancer Rising**

You’ve been in a more introspective place over the past year, reflecting deeply and exploring your purpose through a spiritual lens. This New Moon asks you to take that internal wisdom and begin crafting a plan, one that allows you to continue your spiritual practice while also turning your attention toward financial growth.

If you've felt torn between the spiritual and material realms, remember that you’re here not only to help others but also to support yourself. As you move forward, don’t minimize your financial needs. The universe is both infinite and abundant, and you are part of that abundance. You can be grounded and spiritual. One does not exclude the other.

**Leo Rising:**

This New Moon could awaken your inner star as you step into new social roles. You may be considering joining a group that supports a cause you care about. You’re excited to meet new people, but don’t forget to nurture your existing friendships too. Share your ideas freely and be open to hearing different perspectives.

You may also feel called to explore through travel or learning. Consider signing up for a class you’ve always wanted to take or planning a group trip that centers around meaningful conversation. Whether it's studying culture or dining with friends in a vacation-like setting, this is a time to broaden your mind and expand your horizons.

**Virgo Rising:**

You’ve been shining professionally, and this New Moon supports you in continuing that upward momentum. Have conversations with colleagues or supervisors to plan your next steps. It's also a great time to join a professional organization or sign up for events that can help you grow in your career.

At the same time, don’t neglect what’s happening behind the scenes. Be sure your spiritual path and personal aspirations are in alignment with your deeper values. Seek peace and harmony, but not at the cost of your individuality. Ensure that you are investing in your financial future or at the least, saving for a rainy day.

**Libra Rising**

The one thing you truly need under this New Moon is a break. With everything you've been managing, you may have unintentionally put relationships on the back burner, especially with family, a partner, or your closest friend. Use this energy to take control of your schedule and intentionally carve out time to be with those you love, particularly as the summer holidays approach.

You'll also want to engage with friends, perhaps by attending a party or planning a group outing that brings laughter and connection. Just remember to make space for one-on-one time with your significant other. There’s likely something the two of you have been wanting to do for a while, and it doesn’t have to be complicated. Even something as simple as getting the kids a babysitter could help the two of you reconnect.

**Scorpio Rising:**

It’s time to confront your hidden patterns and create a plan to address old stories related to scarcity, control, and betrayal. You may have felt stuck, but this New Moon brings energy and mental clarity to help you purge a limiting mindset. Take control of your life, your finances, and your resources. Don’t shy away from important conversations about money, assets, or inheritance.

Reclaiming your sense of value and taking action in your career can help pull you out of the rut you've been in. While communication is important, so is following through on the promises you’ve made to yourself. Establish a daily routine that honors both your time and your well-being. Embrace your talents and put them into action.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

With the New Moon in your seventh house, this is the time to clearly state what you want in your one-on-one relationships, and to own what you bring to them. Avoid overthinking. Your partner or close friend wants to hear how you feel, not just what you think. Balance asking questions with expressing your own point of view and aim for collaboration.

When it comes to shared activities, take the lead. This might feel like unfamiliar territory, but planning something fun or romantic could go a long way. Choose a unique restaurant from a culture you haven’t explored, and let the experience bring you closer through discovery and connection. Your adventurous spirit is what attracted your loved one to you, so engage in something fun.

**Capricorn Rising:**

This New Moon offers a fresh start for your routines. Reflect on what’s working and what isn’t, then make a plan. Even small changes can yield big results. If your sleep has been off, try adjusting your caffeine intake, maybe swap your second cup of coffee for decaf. Or, do a guided meditation before bedtime to relax and clear your mind.

You might also reflect on whether you’ve been micromanaging yourself or slipping too far in the opposite direction. This is the moment to strike a healthier balance. If you're relying on automation in your daily tasks, make sure the systems still reflect your voice and style. For example, check your auto-replies to be sure they sound like you.

Health also means managing stress. Book a massage, take time to stretch, give yourself a facial, or simply relax on the couch with a good comedy. Let yourself recharge.

**Aquarius Rising:**

You’ve had a flood of creative ideas this past year, but you may not have known how to bring them to life. With this New Moon in your fifth house, now is the time to capture your inspiration and start giving shape to your thoughts. Whether it’s painting, writing an outline, picking up an instrument, or sketching a product idea, start creating. Even asking deep questions or diving into research counts as creative expression.

If you're overwhelmed by too many ideas, try connecting with a partner or close friend. Talking things out can help you clarify your thoughts and move toward action. Most creatives thrive with a muse, and this is a great time to surround yourself with someone who inspires you. Your exchange with them can help you put everything into place so that you can move forward with your vision.

**Pisces Rising:**

Look around your home, does it reflect the sanctuary you’ve always envisioned? If books are scattered and unfinished projects are piling up, this New Moon offers motivation to get organized. Clear your space, donate what you don’t use, and create a retreat that reflects your vision. Your energy is high, making this a great time to wrap up lingering projects or start new ones that transform your space into something special.

If your home is already in good shape, consider inviting loved ones over. A potluck or game night can bring warmth and joy without breaking the bank. People love being around you, and they feel appreciated when you reach out. If a full gathering feels like too much, simply invite someone for coffee and catch up on each other’s lives. Connecting with those who love you, especially your extended family, can give you that lift in spirit that you have been craving.



# Manifesting with the Current Energy

New Moons are an ideal time to plant seeds, whether for a new mindset, a habit, or a more fulfilling direction in life. This particular New Moon is especially potent for manifestation because it occurs at 6 degrees of Gemini, and several other planets are also in the early degrees of their signs.

In astrology, **early degrees represent beginnings**. They're raw, potent, and full of possibility. These placements signal energy that is still forming, which makes them perfect for initiating change. If you’ve felt like you’re on the cusp of something but haven’t had the words or clarity, this New Moon helps spark the process. Even if the outside world feels like it's moving backward, your inner compass can move forward.

In a few weeks, **Jupiter will enter Cancer**, the sign of its exaltation. What you begin now may grow with extra momentum as Jupiter’s energy shifts. To enhance your manifestation, you can align your affirmations or intentions with the planets currently at early degrees. Choose words that match the archetypal energy:

* **Saturn at 0° Aries**: ownership, responsibility, structure, ambition, independence, initiation, active, self-assertive
* **Neptune at 1° Aries**: vision, imagination, sensitivity, spirituality, dreams, self, action, energetic, direct
* **Mercury at 2° Gemini**: navigation, logic, speech, writing, reason, curiosity, flexibility, diversified, versatility
* **Pluto at 3° Aquarius**: transformation, power, deep change, regeneration, group resources, humanitarian, individuality, revolutionary, non-conforming
* **Sun and Moon at 6° Gemini**: vitality, will, soul, sense of purpose, creativity, feelings, belonging, reaction and response, nurturance, communication, change, talking, asking questions, seeking information  

Use these keywords as inspiration to craft a short affirmation, intention, or personal statement. Choose something you want to begin, reclaim, or reimagine. Then visualize how that statement translates into your daily life.

Here’s an example for a **Libra Rising**, who may be feeling overwhelmed by external demands and work pressures:

*I take ownership of my time and initiate space for myself. When I spend time alone without distractions, I allow my mind to rest and spark imagination. I act on my visions with reason, understanding that life is a balance between my needs and the needs of others. I remain flexible while standing in my individuality and power. My vitality is supported when I create healthy boundaries and honor my need for self-nurturance.*

Now visualize what this looks like. It could mean blocking off lunch each day to eat away from your desk, or committing to no work emails on weekends. It may involve planning quality time with loved ones, or simply doing something that restores your spirit.

Another example, for a **Scorpio Rising** who is reconnecting with creativity and personal expression:

*I take responsibility for creating space for my creative independence. I have visions of the work I want to produce, and I know it’s up to me to bring them to life. Creative expression opens up curiosity and helps me explore what’s possible within myself. I channel themes of humanity and transformation through my art. When I create, I feel powerful. The more I express myself, the more alive I become. My creativity becomes an energetic exchange between myself and those who experience it.*

Once you know what you want, create a plan. If you are an artist, clean up your studio and get organized. Map out time on your calendar to create. Set the mood with lighting or music. Invite your muse to your studio or take walks in nature for inspiration.

You don’t need to be a writer or artist to use this method. All you need is **intention and honesty**. Ask yourself:

* What area of life is not fulfilling me?
* What changes am I ready to take action on?
* What new story am I ready to tell? 

Write your answers, speak them aloud, and **take action**. Fill your calendar with the things that bring you joy, or the tasks that will make those things possible. Create checklists. To make change, you need to be an active participant in the change. That is what manifesting is all about. Manifesting isn’t passive, it is **active**. And it is powered by emotion and feeling.

When you manifest something aligned with your true path, you feel it in every cell of your body. There is a tingling sensation within you. You feel gratitude. You feel connected. Even as I write these words, my cells are vibrating. I am tapping into the energy of manifestation.

Figuring out what you want is only the first step, and it’s where most people stop. Then they get discouraged that nothing materialized. But once you know what you want, you must create the **conditions** for it to happen.

If you want to meet a romantic partner, you need to put yourself in places where someone compatible might go. For instance, if you’re passionate about new technology, join groups that explore tech or attend local TED talks. If you want to be self-employed, research your options and start building a plan.

But those initial actions are just the beginning. **You need to keep showing up**. You need to **communicate**, share your ideas, and keep the energy in motion. If you go to one TED Talk and never attend another, you haven’t committed to the activity, and you haven’t added energy to your intention.

Be grateful for each step. If you attend a networking event and only talk to one person who isn’t aligned with your goals, that’s still movement. You just ruled out one path and refined your vision. You're closer than you were before.

In essence, to manifest you must:

* Visualize
* Plan and communicate
* Take action
* Repeat actions
* Express gratitude
* Adjust your approach
* **Feel the results before they happen**
* Repeat all steps, every day 

Manifestation is not a one-time wish. It’s an ongoing process. And with this Gemini New Moon, the stage is set for your dreams to take root. The energy is here to help you materialize something new. Take advantage of the minor grand trine and the momentum of this lunation. This is your invitation to begin your next adventure, **starting now.**

I never knew my Uncle Josh very well. I’d met him on one or two occasions, at reunions where even the more elusive of distant family members show their faces. There was one in Saratoga, and another in Jersey. I can’t remember whether he was at one, the other, or both. What I do remember was what he was like. He was a quiet man. He wasn’t mean, not by a long shot, but everything he said had a weight to it with how little he talked. I think he made my other family members uneasy. I never really knew why. He was serious, sure, but he wasn’t particularly threatening. I knew he was a vet. He served in Vietnam, with distinction. He was one of the few soldiers in our family. We weren’t a band of fighters or patriots. Maybe that was it. At any rate, he passed away a few years ago. Despite our lack of real connection, he left me everything. His house, his truck, his records, everything. I had fallen on some pretty hard times when he passed. I was in danger of being evicted from my place, and living in Long Island hardly felt worth it. So, I stopped paying rent. I packed up all my belongings and went north. 
I found my Uncle’s old place a couple miles west of the Finger Lakes, in a town called Orange Springs. It was some sort of former industrial town, with big factories laying derelict on the outskirts. But it was cheap, and pretty comfortable. There was some memorabilia from his time in Vietnam tucked away in his room. Pictures, his dog tags, charms and tchotchkes he’d picked up while there. Lots of things to see and pick up. The lawyers were a bit of a hassle to deal with, but all the affairs got sorted pretty quickly. I’d been staying in the house for a few years, when I found a cardboard box I had never seen before in the basement. It was weird. There were ashes, some black feathers, and a journal. I knew as soon as I read the first couple of pages, I had to share it somewhere. So I chose here. There’s a lot written in here, so if people are interested I’ll keep going. Anyway, here’s the first couple of entries. Tell me what you make of it. 





November 12th, 1976 

There’s been a storm looming over my town for a few days. It’s November, so it typically is pretty cold this time of year. But the clouds have been the most disturbing part. The same stormfront has been almost circling overhead, only changing shape slightly. I’m no weatherman, but I don’t think that’s normal. I’ve been ignoring it, everyone has. It’s definitely got people on edge, but what would we do? We’re at its complete mercy. Everyone in this town, the grocer, the sheriff, the farmers on the outskirts, the Mennonites especially, we all know something is very wrong with the sky. We’re all just going about our business, silently acknowledging the dread this thing has produced. All we can do is watch and wait, and I think it’s eating us from the inside. Linda would’ve said it had an aura about it or something mystical like that. God damn it, I miss her. 

November 17th, 1976 

I’ve been going to the community center. The old folks in the town have been gathering there, murmuring amongst themselves. This one old lady, Mama Jess as everyone calls her, is staring at me from the corner of the room. Nobody’s quite sure how old she is or exactly where she came from. One day, she was there, and for twenty years it's been that way. Normally, she is idly reading the same book again or staring off into the fuzzy TV, seeming like she’s never quite paying attention. But today, it’s different. For once she seems alert. Awake. Afraid. Her eyes are wide and her grip on the old wooden chair she’s always planted to is shaking. 
I walk over to her, almost as if she’s calling to me. I sit next to her for a few minutes, watching as Ms. Leminster hangs paper leaves from the wall, dim light bathing the room as the elderly huddle together in anxious whispers. I’ve been coming here for three years, to try and get my mind off of everything that’s happened. The draft, the war… Linda. It helps to feel useful. To be of service to our town. But the laughter and the comradery is gone. The old men congregate not to tell stories, but to share warnings. Jess turns to me finally, having sat in silence for almost five minutes. 
“It’s come again. I never thought I’d live to see the day.” She says. She’s talking to me, clearly, but looking at her face she seems very far away. 
“What is it, Mama Jess? The storm? The rain?” I say to her, feeling a strange tension begin to root itself into my chest. 
“The storm is just a mask it wears. Something to hide away from the prying eyes of man… We ain’t supposed to know. Not then, not now, not ever.” 
“But, Jess… It’s just a storm. These things happen in autumn, y’know?” I don’t believe what I’m saying, but at this point it’s more for my own reassurance than hers. 
“No, child, no…” She almost laughs, a sad and tired sound as she actually turns to me. 
“The clouds come when they’re hungry. When the storm is gone we lay our stones and rebuild. Old dogs like me don’t run away. Nowhere to run to no more. But you, child… You’re young. Live your life free of this wretchedness. Skip town for a few days, and come back ‘round Christmas. It’ll all be over by then.” 
“Leave town? But I just got back.” Her eyes are suddenly filled with fire like I ain’t seen before, and she grabs my arm. 
“Don’t you understand, Joshua? If you don’t leave soon, you won’t leave, not ever.” Suddenly, it’s like she been sedated. She relaxes, settling back and just staring off into space again. 
“It might not matter, anyways… Orange Springs always pulls you back, no matter what you do. Watch the skies and see, child, see the feasting.” With that she is silent again. She didn't talk again today. As I write this, I can see a light on in the community center in the distance. I wonder if she’s still awake. I wonder if she’s right. 

November 20th, 1976 

A crow flew by 
It paused and saw 
The gathered winds 
The unsettled straw 

The fields they wept 
As the cattle retired 
Soon we shall hold 
A funeral pyre. 

November 21st, 1976

The Flendersons dog ran away today. The thing started whining and yipping, apparently, standing at the back door. George doesn’t know what got into him. He figured maybe he had to do his business so he opened the screen door and let him out. The dog didn’t stop at their fence. It squeezed through a gap and wriggled its way free. Then it just ran and ran into the woods until they couldn’t see it anymore. George tried to go after it but he realized it was hopeless. His kid, Ryan, is all shook up about it. Hasn’t left his room all day. Won’t eat. He’s only spoken twice since, asking the same thing: “Why?” I don’t think anyone has an answer. 

November 25th, 1976 

It happened today. Today of all days. I’ll try and write down what I remember. So much in so little time… We were gathered around a shoddy old table in the community center. We were having Thanksgiving dinner, even Mama Jess was eating. There was Turkey and Mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce straight from the can. For a moment, only a moment, I felt the unease leave me and a calm settled down in my brain. Then there was a crack, as thunder sounded somewhere in the distance. Everyone fell silent. Mama Jess began to pray, mumbling something with eyes open and watering. There was a creaking and groaning as a sudden wind was pushing hard against the worn frame of the hall, which seemed to just be pulling through. Then the building shuddered as rain came driving down in sheets, and there was another clap of thunder even closer than before. The lights flickered, struggled, and died. 
The hall was cast into darkness, and for a moment there was no sound except for the elements outside. Then the wailing started. It began at one corner of the room, from the far end of the table. I couldn’t see but I knew. Somehow I knew it was Jess. At first it was low, but slowly it got real shrill as other voices joined it. A panicked chorus of screams and cries as the now blinded congregation began to stagger through the darkness. It was so loud and chaotic I covered my ears, feeling the panic as it began to spread like a fever. People started running, I felt someone slam into my chair and I toppled over. All the anxiety and fear that had been building for weeks was now, all out once, being released into this tiny place, dark as a tomb. I tried to get up but I yelped in pain as someone stepped on my hand, I heard someone coughing and spluttering, choking on their dinner, somewhere nearby a kid was trying to find her mother. Absolute havoc. I began crawling my way to the entrance, feeling my way towards the wall. As I tried to steady myself  using the wall as support, another panicking person came and slammed into me, leaving me to topple over and with a sharp pain in my ribs. I finally stumbled to my feet and managed a painful stumble to the front door. 
Pushing with all my strength, I managed to open the solid wooden door with a shove. For a moment I just stood there, watching as the rainwater formed streams that slicked down Raleigh street and fed into the storm drains below. The rain was pouring hard, each drop like a bullet that disintegrated upon contact with the ground. I put an arm over my head to block some of the droplets that were beating against my skull like a drum. As I turned around to get a look at what was happening inside, I noticed a shape inching closer to the doorway. It was small at first, but as it drew closer I realized with a start that it was Mr. Harrison. He was in his wheelchair like usual, but pushing in such a frenzy that sweat coated his head and a thin line of drool was slipping from his mouth. I saw him coming right at me. By the time I realized what was about to happen, it was all too late. 
The front wheels struck me, knocking me backwards and down the stairs, my head rattling around as I attempted to roll into a ball. I landed on the concrete with a thump, and I yelped in agony as fresh bruises and cuts started to make themselves known. Rolling a few feet, I laid for just a moment to cope with the pain. Feeling my battered rib deeper than ever as I shambled to my feet, I looked with blurry vision and with a mix of sorrow and fear, my eyes laid on Mr. Harrison. His bald head was leaking blood down the steps, his glasses smashed in a little pile in front of him. His wheelchair lay on top of his crumpled body, dented and twisted from the fall. I had that tight feeling in my chest again, my breathing out of control. It was like the worst nights in Vietnam, a stress that ate up everything. I did what the doctor at the VA hospital told me, and I counted to three. Then, I took a deep breath, held it, and let it go. My heart was still pounding as I opened my eyes again, but I was back in the saddle now. 
Harrison was hurt, and would be dead within the hour if he didn’t get some sort of medical attention, something I wasn’t qualified for. Looking around, I caught a pay phone a few feet from the curb, weeds creeping up around the post. I ran to it, trying to call the authorities, when there was a sound like an explosion followed by a shockwave of energy that almost knocked me off my feet. My ears ringing, little shocks running up and down my spine, I turned around, feeling a sudden heat at my back. I yelled in terror when I witnessed the community center ablaze. It had been struck by lightning, and the fire was moving quick now. Even with the rain coming down the way it was, it hungrily ate away at the old building. There were screams coming from inside, it was loud enough now that I could hear it through everything else. Then the roof gave in. Timbers, at least fifty years old by this point, dropped like Lincoln logs from the roof above. Some of the screams were silenced by the falling debris, crushed under their burning weight, and others simply grew more desperate, clearly aware of exactly what was happening to them. I couldn’t do anything. I was totally helpless. I just stood there, dumbfounded by the cruelty and terror of it all. I was snapped from my stupor when I noticed Mr. Harrison was awake, trying desperately to get away from the fire.
 He was dragging himself along the staircase, one hand at a time. It was pathetic, and terrible, and I felt so utterly useless for having not helped him before now. I ran to his side, scooped him up as best I could, and took him  back to the pay phone. I tore off a piece of my shirt, and wrapped it around his head wound as best as I could. Then, I turned back to the fire, and watched as the building began almost folding in on itself. I dialed the fire department as fast as I could, and I heard a siren go off in the distance as the VFD got together to respond. I told them I had a wounded man with me, and they promised they’d bring an ambulance. Fifteen minutes later, and the trucks pulled up on the scene. They blasted that inferno with hundreds of gallons of water, hoping to douse the flames, and to their credit, the fire was out in only a few short minutes. But it was too late. The remaining firefighters ran to look for survivors, and instead recovered charred remains. When the ambulance came, I heard them calling everything they could to deal with it. More ambulances, body bags, transport trucks, everything. The firefighters didn’t fully understand how it could’ve burned so quickly. I knew, though, that this wasn’t no ordinary fire. I stared into that blackened pit, smoke rising from the ashes and the bodies they hadn’t found yet. 

“Watch the skies…See the feasting.”

 I understood then. I’m at war again, with an enemy I can’t  beat. It’ll get its way, and it will consume as many of us as possible before the sun comes back. I’m not backing down this time, though. There won’t be a surrender, and there sure as hell won't be a retreat. This is our home. And it is not welcome here. 

November 27th, 1976 

It’s been two days, and I haven’t been able to get a decent sleep. Harrison called me from the hospital. Told me he would be ok. Thanked me in a sort of empty tone, like he was elsewhere. Didn’t blame the guy. The whole town was shocked of course, but they weren’t there. They didn’t see the hell on earth that place unleashed. The rain’s hardly let up. When it has stopped, the winds have gotten stronger in its place. It’s bad, I won’t lie. It won’t win with some bad weather, though. Takes a little more than a rainy day to put me down. Hold on. Something’s going on downstairs. Jesus Christ, ok, it’s getting worse. Was writing when there was a bang coming from the kitchen. Thought maybe something slammed into the window. I was right, in a way. There was a crow that flew into my window. When I was down there, checking out what happened, another came and hit it, too. Then another, and another, and another. They broke through, eventually. 
Now I got a broken, bloody window, thirty dead crows out back, two in the kitchen, and a live one. Yeah, I was surprised to find the little guy was ok. Seems to be spooked out of his gourd though. Can’t be mad at him, though, it’s just an animal. I’ve let him sit on my counter for now. He’s been still for the last hour, only looking around every so often. I figured I might as well let him weather out the storm. The house is certainly big enough, and I could use the company. Guess I should give him a name. Can’t think of one, though. Suppose I’ll write a couple down when I’ve got ideas. 

November 28th, 1976 

Well, he’s still there. Found him when I was going down for coffee. He made a gruff kinda noise so I gave him some water in an old mug. He drank that thing down. No idea what I’m gonna do with the fella. Sometimes, when I got my back turned to him, I swear his eyes are still on me. Watching me. ‘Spose I got things easy, all things considered though. Whole town’s gone to some type of shit. There was a pileup by the ironworks today. Two eighteen wheelers hauling timber, hit a school bus. Couldn’t see each other in the driving rain. A dozen survivors, maybe, but more than enough hurt or dead to get them to shut down the schools. Shocked that they didn’t do it sooner, frankly. Sheriff’s telling people to stay indoors and batten down the hatches. Don’t let the kids out unless you’re watching ‘em, that sort of thing. All the animals have been going haywire too. 
They gotta know something we don’t, or maybe that we’re just too scared to acknowledge. The Haversam’s cat went crazy and scratched the shit out of Marylin, then ran past her into the attic. They haven’t seen it since. Jorge told me on the phone that he had to lock his dog, Mica, in the basement because she was fighting with tooth and nail to get out of the house. Never seen her so stirred up before, he said.  Herd of cows trampled a ranch hand, broke out of the pen, and caused a major traffic jam in the intersection of Lynch and Canaan street. There have been at least ten different wild animal attacks across town. The biggest Mennonite farm, Friesen’s, had an incident last afternoon. Herd of deer dashed across the cornfields, and the biggest buck of the lot rammed its antlers right into Jeb’s youngest son, Hayden. Poor kid didn’t stand a chance. Took three shots from a .308 rifle to put that thing down. It was like it was rabid, or somethin’, but it didn’t show no signs of sickness.
 People are starting to panic. Every house on my block got its windows shut, the real preppers got them boarded up. Grady must be laughing at us now. We told him he’d never use that old bomb shelter he built in ‘66. Jeb called me this morning. I helped him with a Possum problem once but we weren’t exactly close. He started off talking about the tractor, how the engine needed a new spark plug, then just started breaking down. 
“What have we done, Joshua? What have we done?” He kept saying. The Sheriff's overwhelmed. Hasn’t left his office in over a day now. Jorge told me his wife insisted something was wrong. That he was sick, or depressed, or some other affliction. I don’t know. The crow’s squawking again. He’s gotta be hungry by now. What the hell do crows eat, anyhow?

November 30th, 1976 

Poe eats corn. He likes corn, but he loves Walnuts. Been leaving little bowls of food for him. He finally left his perch in the kitchen. Found him walking around in the living room this morning. He kept staring up the chimney. Little guy was all covered in soot, so I gave him a bath. He didn’t take too kindly to that. Bit my hand, the son of a bitch. I’ve had to put up a grate around the fireplace, he’s obsessed with it. I thought maybe his wing was broken, but I was corrected this afternoon when I opted to kill some time and take a nap. As I woke up, there he was. Staring at me from on top of my door. Poe’s cute as a button, but I’ll be damned if he didn’t spook me from time to time. Hayden’s funeral is on Tuesday. I assume it’ll be an indoor service. Even the gravedigger ain’t going out in this. The Friesens are good folks. Don’t deserve something like this.

December 1st, 1976 

Ryan Flenderson is gone. Ran away last night. George is beside himself. Said he tried to stop him, but the kid just kept saying the dog was out there, in the storm. Whining, barking, yelping, making a racket in the gale. George didn’t hear a thing. There’s a search party out for him, but I figure they won’t find him. It’s the thought that  counts. Looks like the storm is feeding again. A kid, goddamnit. Ten years old. 
Sheriff’s gone too. They finally broke down his door after three days of silence. Place smelled like a sty, they said, and there he was. Sitting on his old chair, eyes rolled back into his head, looking up at the sky as if he could see it through the ceiling. His face was splotched with purple and red, his body bloated to disgusting proportions. They say he choked on something. Not sure what to believe anymore. Deputies are running around like headless chickens, now. None of ‘em know what to do. Not like I could do any better, I suppose.
 I quit my job. I wasn’t making much at the registry anyhow. Mailroom clerk. Jesus, what was I doing with my life? I feel like I’m thinking for the first time since they told me Linda passed. I wasn’t there for her when I needed to be. I wasn’t there for fuckin’ anyone. When I came home, they spit on me. War ended, life moved on. I think a part of me didn’t get on that last chopper outta Saigon. Shit. Gotta sharpen this pencil, I’ve been rambling again. I get lost in my own head sometimes. Wind’s picking up.  

I mean, holy shit! My uncle was so much more out there than I initially imagined. Had no idea he was a writer.  There’s still pages of this stuff, documenting a few month’s worth of material. I’ll post when I get the chance. If anybody can find some of his work, maybe he published it somewhere? Joshua Sommerton? I don’t know. Keep you guys posted when possible.

I’ve never needed to be around people constantly. I’ve found a balance between enjoying my own company and being with others. I genuinely love hanging out with friends, but I also need time with myself to feel whole.

I've figured out that I can do one day of fun with others and then one day just for myself. I really can’t function without carving out that space for me.

Today was one of those days where I felt like I was just rotting away in my room. I suddenly knew I had to step out and see the world. So I grabbed my journal and tote bag, hopped on the early morning metro to Cubbon Park, and poured my thoughts onto paper over a cup of coffee.

It felt so refreshing to be around people and in the midst of Cubbon Park’s greenery. In that moment, life felt really good.❤️

sterilized and unbothered here (as much as one can be). 

My now former friend was bemoaning her 18 month old child and her 5 year old child.  Apparently the kids are ""demanding"". Duh. Children require 25/8/367 work (I added extra on purpose). She went on and on about how the kids won't give her a break. Also, the kids aren't much fun to be around because they are....boring to talk to? Who would expect a child to be entertaining? They keep asking her for things?  

She had a rose tinted view of motherhood despite all my realism, because she was a fence sitter for years. Why do the children owe her fun? They are supposed to be demanding. They should require her full attention. I told her all of this.

 I told her that motherhood is relentless. The kids don't care if you are sick, tired, or need a break....they are seeking to have their needs met even if it means pushing past your boundaries. 

That's what parenthood is. She called me a pessimist. 

At 18 months I doubt the kid has the ability to think ""Oh, mom needs a break, better not shit my pants"". Same with the 5 year old. What is the 5 year old supposed to do? Give her  advice about her marriage? (I did this as a child and I'm no contact with my parents now)  

 Of course, her deadbeat husband refuses to help and said ""I'll help when the kids are older"" (which is a lie and stupid). My friend? Wants to have another baby.  

She said ""once he sees the baby, he will fall in line and help"". I told her....""I don't think that's how it goes, he's not gonna help"". 

Again she told me I was being unrealistic. 

 If you are miserable...why want more kids?  I tried to point out that three kids wouldn't help her feelings of overwhelm, but she told me I was being negative. She said if I don't support her in having another kid we should end the friendship. 

I deleted her number this morning. She used to be fun to talk to, loved hanging out, she loved to read, and now...she only talks about her kids and how ""demanding"" they are. I remember the person I used to be friends with. I miss her. 

Off to make other friends. Anyway...went on a hike this morning and now I'm having coffee and deciding what to have for lunch. Pasta sounds nice. What are y'all up to? ",12,1748188647.0,childfree,7,1.0,False

The Zarathrustrens
by Kayak Rleman
Based on the novel Little Fuzzy 
by H. Beam Piper

Chapter one

Zarathrustra's orange sun peeked over the horizon flooding the landscape in a brilliant and soft light. Beneath the canopy of an enchant forest small creatures began to wake up. Reptiles and amphibians warmed themselves on rocks and branches while other creatures occupied their time with drinking up the sweet dew before it evaporated. A Zarathrustran copper back tree frog the size of a man's thumb nail watched as a land prawn scurried past beneath it. Land prawns were one of Zarathrustra's most prolific pests. They could grow up to eighteen inches long, with twelve thin legs, strong pincers and would try to eat or maim just about anything, making them hell on electrical wiring and coolant lines. It was also believed by many xeno zoologists and naturalists that land prawns had no natural predators. 

The frog watched as something else, bipedal and about two feet tall covered in thick golden hair, emerged silently from the underbrush. It carried something with a thin handle and a broad slightly concave blade in its hands, which it now lifted over its head. The blade came down with a metallic ting severing the land prawn's head cleanly and with little apparent effort. The land prawn never saw what ended its life so abruptly. The frog watched as the prawn was flipped over, and was given two good slaps with the flat of the blade cracking it open. If the frog had been capable of higher thought, it might have thought something like “Well, that settles that.” Instead it wondered if there was something nice to eat on the next tree. It went to go find out.                               

In the middle of a clearing with trees densely packed around and a stream babbling through, stood a house. It was one of those prefabricated homes from Tarra put there twenty years ago by someone who thought they were going to strike it rich mining sunstones. In that time it had a number of owners. Some had died but most had gone back to Tarra, or tried their luck on other planets like Thor or Loki. It was a white geodesic dome made out of molded composites. A thick green moss, its color diminished somewhat by the lack of rain this year, grew around the base and on the shadier parts up the walls, hiding old damage that the new occupants didn't know about. Inside, a golf game from Tarra was playing quietly on a view screen. Someone, his back turned to the view screen, hissed in frustration as his own ball missed the paper cup again. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as the first rays of sunlight came through the windows. The home was made for those kinds of men who spent most of their time outside, and would only come in to eat and rest. The current occupants had tried their best to make it more habitable with many setbacks along the way, the local pests being one of them.  

A man cursed in pain and surprise, Hezekiah Thomson, a tall and surprisingly hairy man, leaped out of bed one hand pressed tightly over an open wound on his thigh. He looked down at his bed and saw an enormous land prawn, the creature somehow got in and under his sheets. It moved its pincers back and forth, clacking them while swaying from side to side, as if daring anyone to take the mattress from him, which was now his by rite of conquest. Hezekiah walked over to the bedroom door and throw it open, then went back to the side of his bed, grabbed a corner of the top sheet and throw it over the posturing invertebrate. He wrapped the land prawn up as best he could with one hand then grabbed the struggling bundle, and angrily walked out into the hallway. He was going to go outside, put the land prawn on the ground then crush it with a rock, preferably a big one. He was not a intentionally cruel person and was rather fond of animals, but these prawns were to much even for him. Before he could do any of this, before he was even half way to the door the little pest somehow managed to free a pincer and clamp it down on it's captors thumb. Hezekiah, more out of instinct then anything else, threw it down the hall. The bed sheet unraveled in midair and the prawn landed on its back and slid across the smooth hard wood floor towards the living room.
	It was at that time a small, brightly collard reptilian humanoid by the name of Vorbus came around the corner, presumably to see what all the noise was about. He held a putter in one hand, the little reptile liked to get up early, have a cup of coffee and get in a good thirty minutes or so of practice in the quite morning hours before the tall hairy human came out. Vorbus' keen golden eyes first saw Hezekiah in his underwear with blood dripping down his leg and looking very angry. The second thing he saw was a large land prawn, it's twelve thin legs groping madly at the air and sliding towards them, Vorbus hissed in surprise and kicked it back down the hall. “Don't kick it back!” Hezekiah yelled, hauling back a foot then driving it down in a savage kick that lifted the land prawn off the floor and over Vorbus' head. It hit the wall and came crashing down onto the coffee table, breaking a Vorbus' mug and spilling coffee everywhere. “Get that thing out of here” Hezekiah said throw clenched teeth, hopping on one foot grabbing his toes and trying to rub some feeling back into them. Vorbus ran to the front door opening it, then ran back towards the kitchen and out of sight. A few seconds later he came back into view, this time holding a pitching wedge. Vorbus used the club to push the land prawn off the table and towards the door, flipping the thing onto it's back every time it managed to right it's self. Once he got it lined up with the open door, he set his feet, squared his solders and brought the club up. His slitted eyes never leaving there target as the club came sweeping down. The steel wedge connected with a dull thud, as he hit the floor in front of the prawn which caused his swing to come up short. Vorbus took a half step forward and brought up the club for a second swing. This time he managed to graze its upturned belly, which made it cartwheel wildly out the door and on to the porch, this time landing on it's feet, dazed. Vorbus yelled in frustration and ran after it, holding the club over his head like a battle ax. He skidded to a halt right beside it and brought the club down. Ones, twice, three times. Then picked it up and hurled it over the lawn and into the bushes. Vorbus, calmer now, walked back in and closed the door, then looked at Hezekiah and asked In a voice that sounded like he had a frog in his throat “You okay?”

Hezekiah tentatively put his foot down, being careful not to put to much weight on it. “Yeah, I'll be fine I think” he looked down at his right thigh, a surprising amount of blood leaked out passed his fingers and down has leg. “The little shit got me pretty good.” he lifted his hand and looked at the wound. It wasn't as bad as he worried it was going to be, just nicked a vein that was it, and a clean cut at that. “I'm gonna get myself patched up. Then we should go and see if there's any more of them outside.” 

Vorbus nodded and went back to the kitchen. He sighed at the realization that he would have to make a new cup of coffee. “And it had been such a nice morning too.” he thought a little resentfully and more than a little annoyed. He sniffed the air and caught a whiff of fresh hot blood, his stomach began to growl, and his thirst had been replaced momentarily by hunger. He grabbed a step stool from beside the sink and went to the fridge, he was four feet and two inches tall and from time to time needed some vertical assistance, to navigate a human sized world. This was made more necessary because Hezekiah the oversized primate, had a bad habit of putting things where Vorbus could not reach them. He opened the fridge and got on the stool. The leftover zebralope steaks were on the top shelf of course, he was beginning to wonder if Hezekiah was doing this on purpose. He pulled out the rarest and fattest steak and ate it cold with mustard.

Hezekiah limped to the bathroom and tried to stop the bleeding the best he could. After a few minutes of using paper towel after paper towel the bleeding slowed enough to use a Doctor Mikes smart strip. He used the large three by four inch strip, opening the package with his teeth and put it on. The smart strip began working animatedly, sealing itself and tightening slightly for extra security. The strip was impregnated with antibiotics, disinfectants and pain killers. Hezekiah took a moment to wash his face and look at him self in the mirror. He was thirty, with a warm inviting face, though it had seen better mornings. Blue eyes and thick auburn hair which he had always kept short and professional looking on Tara. On Zarathrustra he had let it grow out to mid neck, with a well established if short beard. He was also tall, 6' 6” with an athletic build that had become soft over the years after leaving his constriction job to become a reporter, though he had been loosing weight steadily since he came to the planet one year ago. Maintaining a property on a frontier planet, especially one that had been abandoned for a few years was a full time job. Which is why the magazine he worked for was able to buy it for so cheap. Thankfully because of his construction experience, it had not been a daunting task, though it was tiresome. 

Hezekiah was a reporter slash photographer for Nature magazine, reporting on and photographing wild life of all different kinds. Sometimes having to stalk them like a hunter, or wait for many hours in homemade blinds. The weather was another thing he wrote about, though the differences on Zarathrustra compared to Tarra were small, but he did make an effort to spice it up. His favorite thing to do was interviewing fellow outdoors men and other people of the bush, like Sooty the fur trapper, who hated whiskey but would gulp down beer like it was going out of style. His real name was Bobby Piper, but most people called him Sooty for the seemingly never ending amount of dirt, ash and sawdust that would collect on any surfaces the longer he was around them. Vorbus had put his foot down on the topic of Sooty coming inside. Besides the filth which to Vorbus always seemed to end up in him cleaning it up thank you vary much, and besides that. The distressing smell that came off him was worse. Spend enough time in Sooty's presence and ones nose would give up in self defense. So more often than not the two men would stand outside and talk. 

Hezekiah also did a little work on the side for Eden, a gardening magazine for which he used an alias. Back on Tarra he had spent most of his free time in the rock mountains where his family lived, hunting, fishing, swimming and camping. The latter usually spent getting completely hammered with his friends, it was on one of these alcohol fueled camping trips he met his future ex-wife Melissa. They had kept in touch after their first night together, eventually falling in love and got married. They never had children, which was a kind of blessing sadly enough. Hezekiah liked his current job very much, it got him off of Tarra which was a good thing, for more personal reasons than just his ex-wife. Some times he worried if he was just running away from his problems. Working kept him from thinking about it.   
	
He cleaned himself off and limped back to his room to get dressed, he had to be somewhat gentle while pulling on his boots. His foot had turned red and was tender to the touch, maybe a visit to Mallorie's port to get an x-ray would have to be arranged. As he was lacing up his boots a cool breeze brushed passed his cheek, he looked over and saw the window was ajar. That explained how the land prawn got in, but he couldn't remember doing that. Leaving the window open was not something he made a habit of considering there were things far worse than land prawns out there. There used to be a bug screen in front of the window, but something had torn it off soon after he arrived. Maybe a Dam thing or a bush goblin. He just hadn't gotten around to relapsing that yet, another thing he would have to buy, he didn't want to think about that right how.   

Once Hezekiah got his boots on, he closed the window, locking it and limped out to the living room. Vorbus had already cleaned up the mess on the coffee table, fortunately nothing else had been damaged. He saw Vorbus standing on the step stool washing his hands. Oorans were fastidious by nature and he was no exception. Sunlight glinted off his scales which were mostly green with patterns of copper and gold dispersed over his body. He had no tail to speak of, but he did have a full head of blue and purple feathers, which usually stayed down, unless something scared or ,more likely, angered him. A jar of mustard sat open on the counter next to a zebralope bone that had been picked clean. So clean that at a glance one could have been forgiven if they assumed the meat had been boiled off. Vorbus dried his hands, put the mustard away and cleaned off the counter. He had already been dressed prior to this mornings incident. He didn't wear much when he was at the house, just a pair of cut off jeans and a old dribble canvas vest. The kind with big pockets that duck hunters used, of course scaled down for someone the size of a child. When they went to town, he would be in full military uniform, boots, side arm and all. 

Vorbus had been sent as a body guard for Hezekiah. Because of the inherent danger of frontier planets Hezekiah's magazine requested an armed bodyguard for the duration of his stay. Someone by the name Lenred Kellogg, a high ranking member in the Zarathrustra company management, not wanting to risk the bad press of a Tarren reporter, being mauled to death or more likely just plain shot by some prospector or a drunk ranch hand on there planet. But not wanting to put any company money into it or have any responsibility if thing went south. Lenerd Kellogg called the Tarren federation navel base on Series one of Zarathrustra's two moons, and requested that a marine be sent down. The navy, having a well tuned sense of humor, sent Vorbus in response, an aviation extrusion airmen a navel lower enlisted men, basically a private first class if he had enlisted in the army or marines. The navy had finally found a place for Vorbus, and it was far away from them. It wasn't that he was bad at his job, he just had a tendency of making his fellow airmen nervous. Maybe it was the way he would keep eye contact for an uncomfortably long time while never blinking, as if wondering what you tasted like. Or the way he would sharpen his talons in full view of everyone in the hanger. It didn't help that one of his NCO's, who Vorbus disliked immensely, suffered from herpetophobia- the fear of reptiles. No one knew if Vorbus was aware of this, but it did seem rather convenient that Vorbus would show up in areas of the ship he should not have been. He would appear from around corners, be standing behind doors seemingly minding his own business and one time washing the NCO's air jeep, the man had to take time off after that one. Many complaints had been leveled at Vorbus, the only people he could call his friends were members the ships golf club, tellingly no one in the club was someone he worked with. So when the company called looking for a bodyguard he was selected without bias, and out of a long list of other worthy candidates, or so he was told before he was sent down. With the knowledge that if he did anything to embarrass the navy, he would be discharged immediately. 
	It wasn't a bad job all thing considered. All he had to do was baby sit a rather easy going reporter who spent most of his time writing, developing pictures or gardening. The last one confused him, there was a small vegetable garden by the west side of the house, which was sensible though he didn't partake for dietary reasons, Oorans being strict carnivores. The part that confused him was the expansive flower garden. Hezekiah seemed to have a strange affection for them, all different kinds too and in this case all from Zarathrustra. He wrote about them at great length and could be seen talking to them or to himself, he really didn't care what Hezekiah did or didn't do as long as it didn't come around to bother him. Vorbus guessed there was an audience for flowers back on Tarra, probably old people and house wives. All that writing and gardening gave Vorbus plenty of time to pursue his own passions. Like perfecting his golf game, his driver had seen more use since he was given the job, and being able to watch the PGA tour without interruption was a real treat. He could also listen to music without being rudely interrupted by some greasy under bite, with a bad case of the I'm to good to suck in my gut petty officer. At the moment Igor Stravinsky was his favorite, though Alexander Scriabin would always hold a special place in his small cold blooded hart. 

On occasion he would have to do some real work. This morning they had to round up land prawns before they could do any real damage to the house. Hezekiah and Vorbus went to the shed and both grabbed a bucket, then spent the next hour collecting land prawns. Afterward they would take them out into the woods and using a large stone would crush them. A hole was dug to bury them so that their rotting flesh would not attract predators. As they were walking back to the shed to put there buckets away Hezekiah stopped and knelt down, examining something. It was the outer husk of a land prawn, it's head neatly removed and the flesh picked out with a pincer missing. “Hey Vorbus,” Hezekiah said. 
	
Vorbus terned around, “what?” 

Hezekiah held up the husk for inspection. “What do you make of this?”

“I don't know,” Vorbus said taking the husk and sniffing it. 

“Anything familiar?” Vorbus shook his head and handed it back. Hezekiah considered this “Well let's hope what ever did this only eats land prawns.” They put the buckets away and walked back to the house. Hezekiah took the husk, sealed it in a bag and put it away. He would have to ask someone about that, maybe make it into an article, it could even have a funny name like who killed liberty prawn or the case of the shell cracker, it would need some work. After a brief coffee break where Hezekiah spent most of it trying to ignore the pain in his foot, he went back out to do some gardening. He grabbed his riffle, a big 11.5 by 56mm semi auto for protection. He did have a brand new phoenix arms forty five super auto on his hip, which was good for most things but the heavy rifle was good for everything else. He went back out to the shed, grabbed his gardening bucket and went to the west facing side of the house. The vegetable garden was doing well despite the lack of rain. It was fortunate that the nearby stream was still flowing strong or he might have been forced to use tap water which was a reverse osmosis setup and the filters got expensive fast. If that had been the case the only option would have been to let it go all to seed. He knelt down and began to weed, pulling out the deep rooted vine called a thorn flower. They were beautiful in their way like Tarran thistles, but if you weren't careful the horrible things would take over any garden. Hezekiah grabbed one thorn flower which looked almost ready to bloom and pulled, it broke before the root even budged, it would have to be dug out. He throw threw the top aside and reached for his trowel, it wasn't there. What he took out instead was a flat pees of dark hard wood approximately ten inches long and vaguely trowel shaped if a bit pointier. Dirt was embedded in the edge and there were a few dings and gouges across the flats. He looked in the bucked to make shore his trowel wasn't there, then brought his attention back to the thing in his hand. Several thoughts went through his head, mostly questions like “What on Tarra is this thing? Where's my trowel? Is this some kind of joke? And if it is I don't get it.” He wonder if Vorbus had anything to do with this, then he thought better of it. Vorbus was not one for jokes, as a matter of fact Hezekiah was fairly convinced that the reptile had no sense of humor whatsoever. Besides, he wouldn't have wasted his time with something non golf related, Hezekiah was still going to ask, maybe Vorbus would have some incite into this things. It was worth a shot, though it was probably a long one. He finished weeding first before limping back inside. 

Vorbus lounged on the sofa, feeling rather bored and reading an article from a magazine called woods weekly as sunlight came through the windows warming him. He had to make a conscious effort to not open his mouth while sun bathing,  it was one in a long list of things that humans found off putting, or so Dr. Walker said. In the article a man called Robert Ferguson, a coach with thirty years of experience under his belt, talked positively about the carbotanium shafts on the new Ping 3000 series drivers and woods. “Give yourself the upper hand and make those par fives tune into par threes. See as your friends look on in amazement as you play like a pro. Even PGA all stars David Mickelson and Michelle Wong have switched over with great results.” As he read his stomach began to ache with longing at the idea of owning a set of clubs like that, it would be the best thing that ever happened to him. Hell just a driver would be fantastic, but one of those would cost ten times more then his whole bag. Vorbus stole a glance at his own set of clubs, they were a cheap set of left handed youth Nitros. Not good but not the worst he had ever seen he thought, trying to convince himself. Besides, a quadruple bogey on a par three wasn't that bad, he had seen loads of people do worse. Well actually he had heard about loads of people who were worse than him. As of yet a quadruple bogey had been his best score. He put the magazine aside suddenly in a bad mood. “Its not my fault I can't hit the ball as far as the other players” he thought resentfully. The other players being his fellow naval airmen who were all human. Being 4'2” and 85LB put him at a serious disadvantage when playing against others twice his weight or more. He looked back at the magazine and thought “If I just had one of those drivers, I could show all those officers how to really play.” A not too friendly smile appeared across his face, and for the hundredth time he wondered if the on base bank could see it in there hearts to look past his bad credit and give him a loan. Maybe he could convince Hezekiah to co-sign on it, he would have to ask him after he soaked up a little more sun. Vorbus grabbed the magazine and went back to reading, his mouth dropping open without him realizing it.       
	Vorbus was not strictly speaking a normal lizard man. For starters he was the first and so far only alien to have ever been a rank and file member of the Tarran armed forces. The reason being that hitherto all known alien races did not possess the cognitive abilities necessary to be anything but a hindrance in a modern space faring military. He was the exception, amongst his own people he was a literal genius which put him around average human intelligences. Vorbus new from a very young age that he was different, often preferring to spend his days alone or with the small group of humans that were there to study his people. Mostly xeno naturalists and their marine body guards that hung around the drier parts of his tribes swamp. Some members of his tribe saw the new comers as divine beings, wile others treated them with suspicion and caped there distance. Vorbus on the other hand saw them for what they were and wanted to be it. It wasn't hard to git into the good graces of the scientists. All he had to do was show some willingness and follow along in a few simple and somewhat boring games that measured cognitive ability. They were immediately impressed at how fast he figured the games out, and challenged him with more complex games that caught his interest. As the days turned into weeks he managed to astound the scientists working with him, even the marines who spent most of their time scanning the perimeter were taking notes. Vorbus was quite young at the time, barely over three feet tall, and was not the kind of person how made friends easily, especially with other Oorans who thought he was crazy and viewed as something other. Vorbus thought his people were stupid and spent most of his time avoiding them, but he liked the humans and loved the attention he was receiving from his new friends.
	One day as he and Dr. Walker, a small man with a bushy mustache, were playing chess, a game he had never won but could still put up a fight. Walker asked him if he would like to have lunch early Vorbus looked up and said in a nervous froggy voice “Y-y-yes.” 

“Well thats good to hear, maybe...” Dr. Walkers looked up from the board, letting his brain catch up with what just happened. “What did you say?”

“Y-y-yes” Vorbus' heart pounded in his ears, he hoped he said the word correctly. He had been listening carefully and wanted to impress his new friends, and impress them he did. As a matter of fact they were so impressed, they couldn't help but gawk at him. For the first time since he met them he felt genuinely insecure, and wished they would stop looking at him like he was some kind of freak. Then Dr. Walker smiled and began to laugh, “You are full of surprises aren't you my little friend.” The doctor stood up and straightened his jacket, “We'll have to teach you how to you speak properly now won't we?” Vorbus nodded vigorously as relief flooded his body, if he had been capable of sweating he probably would have ruined the small vest one of the marines made for him. Dr. Walker construed Vorbus for a moment. “My god... the moment I think we have you figured out, you go on and do something like this.” He shook his head in disbelief “Absolutely extraordinary.” After that day everything changed for him, the scientists taught him how to speak Tarran and how to read and write, then moved onto math and astronomy. In return he told them all he new about his own people, their traditions and beliefs. His marine friends taught him other things that were far more fun, mostly because they were things he was pretty sure he was not supposed to do. Like shooting a gun, small pranks on the scientists, poker which he was remarkably good at, and smoking. Vorbus preferred the thin sweet cigars that corporal savage gave him over the cigarettes that the others smoked. A year had past, Vorbus had been living with them for months and was considered by all an honorary member of the team. So when it came time of the scientists to go back to Tarra, Vorbus was given the chose to come with. He accepted immediately and leafed eventually behind, eventually becoming a Tarran citizen, joined the navy and in a small way made history.

When Hezekiah came back in with the wooden thing in his hand, he found Vorbus standing next to an open window smoking one of the sweet cigars he bought in Mallorys port. Hezekiah limped over his foot still in pain and said, “hey Vorbus take a look at this and till me what you think.” Hezekiah held out the object of inspection, Vorbus put his cigar down in an ash try on the window sill and took the piece of wood in his hands. He ran his scaly palms over the sides and edges, gently scraping with a talon at the nicks and gouges before asking. “Where did you find this?""

“It was in the gardening bucket. I was doing a little weeding, went to grab the trowel, which is missing, and found this instead.”  
	
Vorbus brought it to his nostrils and inhaled slowly then stopped, seeming to consider something, “Wheres the prawn husk?” Vorbus asked.
	
“It's in the work room sealed up in a grower.”

“Go and get it.” Hezekiah left and came back a minute later with the bag handing it to Vorbus, who opened the bag and sniffed the prawn husk, a look of recognition settled on his face. “It's the same smell. It's faint but it is the same.” He said with certainty. 
	
“I bit it belongs to one of those fur trappers that comes threw this area, he probably lost his shovel, made this thing and then decided to do a little trading on his way through.” Hezekiah said anger rising in his voices, “You now... I should have known better then to keep that shed unlocked.” Hezekiah said.
	
Vorbus thought about that for a moment before saying, “I don't think so.”

“What do you mean?”
	
“I mean the only human sent on it is yours, the other is vary unique.” Vorbus smiled it again and thought to himself that the odor coming from the handle was actually quite pleasant.  
	
“Well it has to be human, this is a class three uninhabited planet,” Hezekiah said with certainty. “If there was sentient life native to Zarathrustra I think some one would have discovered it by now.” 
	
Vorbus looked up at Hezekiah feeling a little offended that someone who was relying on his sense of smell would second guess him so flippantly. He also thought it was very short-sighted and maybe a little human centric to think that, because on one aka humans hadn't discovered something in thirty some odd years, that meant that it didn't exist. Vorbus narrowed his eyes and said “Well thats what I smell and I now it's not human.” He put the husk back in the bag and resealing it before giving it back to Hezekiah. “Also let me remind you, it took your kind ten years to find my people, and that was only because we made huge bonfires to get your attention.”
	
That gave Hezekiah pause and made him look at the tool in his hand with some new consideration. “Well perhaps it's possible, though you would think if there was something on this planet that could make tools like this. Then we should have some evidence of non human made structures or at the very least fires.”
	
Vorbus shrugged, it was a good point. He personally didn't know of any sentient races who didn't now how to make fire. Even Coogras new how to do it and they were dumber than a bag of hammers, “Maybe theres a possibility.” Hezekiah with out a word went back to work room and put the prawn husk and the wooden tool in a cabinet. As he limped back his injured foot hit the corner of a chair, he inhaled sharply and grabbed the offending piece of furniture before he could fall. Vorbus was at his side in a heart beat, “I think we should go to Mallorys port and get that looked at.” Vorbus said matter-of-factly.
	
Hezekiah nodded his face looking a little pale, “Yes, yes you're right thank you.” 
	
“No need, it's my job to take care of you.”
	
“Oh yes and what a good job your doing,” Hezekiah thought a little sarcastically, though he would never say this to Vorbus' face, despite there differences Hezekiah actually liked Vorbus. He was worried that his bodyguard was going to be someone who would constantly fret over him and never give him any personal space or time. On the contrary, despite Vorbus' height and alien appearance, the little reptile was easy to get along with, hell he was practically human in most respects. It had gotten to the point where he had stopped noticing that Vorbus was an alien, and when they went to Mallorys port sometimes a passerby would remark that Hezekiah's companion was in fact not human. Sometimes this would catch Hezekiah off guard and he would say something like, “Oh yeah funny that, you now after a while you just stop noticing.”

Hezekiah took a couple pain pills and waited for Vorbus to get changed into his uniform. When he was ready they got into the air jeep, climbed to three hundred feet and made a bee line to Mallorys port. As they flew out of sight and the sound of the air jeeps generator faded into nothing, a small hand covered in blonde fur, cautiously reached threw the open window, and took the smoldering cigar out of the ash tray. It made a soft and curious “yek” noise and a few moments later began coughing spasmodically. It threw the cigar down and gave it a few good stomps just to be safe. It's large green eyes looked up at the open window, it wondered what kind of things could be in there, that made the tall one stay inside for such long periods of time. It wasn't sure but it did have ideas. It jumped up and grabbed the window sill, it went to go find out.

I wake up at 6AM and not for a peaceful walk, but to star as an unpaid extra in yet another morning montage where my mother, Meanana, fake yawns three times and calls it content.

No breakfast for her yet, but she’s already talking crap to the camera about her $12 “mid” coffee and how my other lunatic parent, Toe Fungus, left at 4AM to walk Arepita. Again. Allegedly, of course because we all know that man barely sleeps over.

I finally get outside, hoping for a quick sniff break, but nope, of course not, she’s too busy filming me. I try to pee, and suddenly it’s a brand deal shoot. No privacy, no dignity. I’m just trying to do my job out here.

Back home, my dad, Toe Fungus, finally decides to make an appearance and he’s already clomping around in his hooves and those dirty scrubs he’s had on since who knows when, debating with my mom, Meanana about which shade of “greige” screams future healthcare fashion icon. Because when you’re not studying, not working, and living off my mom, I guess that becomes the hill you die on.

Now it’s later in the day and I’m stuck at home, forced to endure yet another rerun of Hannah Montana and Suite Life of Zack and Cody on repeat like my mom forgot she’s pushing 30 and not still 12.

By evening, she’s fake crying over dry cleaning while calling it a “hard week,” right before posting their rare peck kiss. The kind my dad Toe only offers every 5 to 7 business days, if you’re lucky. 

Nighttime rolls around, and my dad Toe has already been long gone, probably off somewhere rearranging his hooves or Googling “how to stall a proposal until 2045.” and “how long can you drag out a relationship before proposing.” Meanwhile, my mom is home alone in the same crusty striped pajamas, lighting candles and setting up the camera like she’s in a long-term relationship and not a long-term delusion. She starts talking in plural like “we’re winding down for the night,” and I’m sitting there like… who’s we? The man left six hours ago.

She’ll even stage a “Toe’s asleep” moment by dimming the lights and whispering like she’s got to be quiet…girl, the only thing in this house snoring is me.

Everything I am about to tell you is one hundred percent non-fiction, even though I so desperately want it not to be true. A dream. A figment of my imagination, if you will. I’m going to put my cards down on the table and fully admit that right now, I’m more frightened, cold, isolated and alone than I’ve ever been before and it’s all because I made the trip across the pond and ended up in this almost unheard of town in the arse end of the American midwest. Ohio, to be specific. A town by the name of Whitehawk Springs. A remote city nestled within the heart of the state. Not a big town whatsoever. A population of around 36,000 maybe? Those figures might not be entirely accurate, but you get the point. 



For a bit of context, I grew up in a relatively socially depraved area of South London. My mother died when I was around six and not long after is when my father walked out on me. Since then being raised by my Aunt. I love that woman to death and want more than anything in the world to be with her again right now. Over the years, let’s just say, I’ve had my fair share of “issues”.



It’s no secret that growing up working class in the inner city is a very “dog eat dog” kind of life where you have to toughen up and be ready to defend yourself to avoid being mauled to death (usually by pimps or loan sharks if not literal feral Kaynines). So when the opportunity to take a temporary escape from this life came along, I was more than on board.  



It started in college with the student exchange program. Designed to give disenfranchised young people from broken homes the opportunity to broaden their horizons. As in, a troubled kid from somewhere overseas gets to experience life here and someone like me would fly half way around the world to end up working on a farm somewhere, at least that’s what I assumed at the time. I’d just turned eighteen years old and what I wanted more than anything was to be able to decompress and live my life, just for a bit, instead of looking over my shoulder 24/7. 



So that’s exactly what I did. I woke up at around 5 in the morning, said my goodbyes to my aunt and set off to spend some time overseas for around 4 weeks or so. I travelled to the airport with around six other students who were also taking part in the program. Our college instructor, Tracey, gave us all words of encouragement “I went to America when I was your age and had the time of my life, but be prepared, even though we speak a common language, Americans are about as foreign as the Russians”.  At this point, I knew very little about the United States in general, let alone Ohio. All I had to base my expectations off of was the vast catalog of American movies and TV I grew up watching. You know, the typical slices of Americana that are constantly drip-fed all across the globe through popular culture. The white pickett fences, the freshly cut lawns and the endless stretch of roads and houses that seem to go on for miles. Suburbia. The American dream. Quite a different reality to life in South London. 



I ended up flying for around 9 hours on a British airways flight non-stop to Chicago international. I arrived at around 7:45 in the morning, jetlagged and exhausted. It wasn’t the worst journey I’d ever experienced (not that I had that much experience anyway) . The dude I was seated next to on the plane, who was also part of the program I learned was called Jason. We quickly started chatting and became friends. Jason had also grown up in South London and was here for the exact same reason as me. I think most of the students here had the same mindset. 

After leaving the airport, we boarded a coach and drove for around 5 and a half hours before finally arriving in Whitehawk Springs. From the very first time I laid my eyes upon the sign-post for the town’s entrance, a part of me wondered what I’d gotten myself into. “A very warm welcome to the settlement of Whitehawk Springs, Home of the Whitehawk Corporation” 

When I signed on to this trip, I had no idea that Whitehawk was a company town, not that I even really knew what a company town was, being from another country and all. The whole concept was rather alien to me at least. Another thing that caught me off guard was the amount of American flags literally everywhere, as well as the amount of religious paraphernalia that littered almost every front yard. On the whole, I knew Americans were generally more religious than the Brits but to this extent, I wasn’t prepared for. 



Soon enough, I came to my stop and learned that Jason and I would be staying in the same home with the same family who were called the Ashbrooks. They consisted of Jerry and Darline Ashbrook and their two adult children. Henry and Joanna, ages 18 and 19 respectively. As soon as Jason and I started up the long, heavily tarmaced driveway, Jerry and Darline appeared to greet us. Darline, a petite woman with a bob-style haircut was the first to embrace us, each both in enormous bearhugs and donning a smile that was so aggressive, it might as well have been forced. The house was huge, and to someone who grew up in a British council house, it seemed like a mansion. A wooden porch snaked around the entirety of the house with a beige cushioned porch-chair to the left of the front door swaying lightly in the wind. Jerry smiled. He was a tall bloke, around 6,1. His hair greased back across his scalp with a single curled strand laying across the left side of his forehead. He wore a pair of thick black-rimmed coke-bottle glasses and a grey suit with a red tie neatly tucked underneath his jacket. Jerry shook both our hands and introduced himself, Henry and Joanna. As we went inside, we were shown to our room which we’d be sharing, a spacious room at the back of the house with two single beds, both of which had nicely wrapped picnic baskets full of various snacks and baked goods, much to our delight. 



Dinner that night was also amazing. Turkey, mashed potato, cranberry sauce, mac and cheese, it was all there. Everything was incredible. It was everything the movies depicted. Almost too accurate. I remember Jason and I joking about it being like living in a real-life version of The Truman Show, and, to be honest, we weren’t far off in that regard.



The next day, we learned that we’d be spending our days, not in a traditional American high school or a community college but instead, all overseas students would be training as interns for the Whitehawk Corporation, this was a company town after all and Jerry, it turned out, was the deputy executive on the company board, Darline was a stay-at-home housewife of course, there to maintain the garden, clean the house and cook the evening meals consisting of a more than generous helping of carbs and red meat. So much for feminism. We learned that Henry and Joanna would be our guides since they were already employees at the company and had been for quite some time. We were given our uniforms, Navy blue overalls with our names stitched onto the left side of the chest and we were good to go. 



We got in the Ashbrook family car, a 1950s DeSoto custom station wagon and drove for around 25 minutes to the Whitehawk Company HQ. During the drive, I couldn’t help but notice the excessive array of numerous fast food establishments that lined the highway. I must’ve counted around fifteen at least. All with drivethroughs. Pavements, or “sidewalks” seemed completely absent. No room for walking here. In Whitehawk, the automobile was the primary choice of transportation. 



When we arrived at the Whitehawk Company HQ, We were greeted by a large herd of people in hard-hats and high-vis jackets all standing in a cluster by the front gate. A good number of them were wielding various signs on placards stapled to wooden posts. I couldn’t quite make-out what they said but they seemed to be shouting or rather chanting in unison. 



“Eh, god damn unions” Jerry muttered to himself as he navigated the vehicle at a steady pace around the block to avoid any kind of coalition with any of the people. We pulled up at the gates and were greeted by a security guard sitting in a booth. Jerry flashed his keycard and the barrier lifted letting us through to the parking lot.



 a mandatory introduction for all new trainees by the head of the company. Mr Alistair J Whitehawk was the first thing on the table as soon as we entered the building. Mr Whitehawk was a shorter bloke, possibly around 5’6 and had a short black, neatly groomed circular beard plastered firmly across his face. He wore a dark, blue velvet suit and a pair of brown loafers. The dress-style of a man with more than a bit of personal wealth. 



“Welcome, all these new faces” He declared, in his upper class American accent. I figured he probably went to Harvard or some other fancy college that someone like myself could only ever dream of being accepted into. 



“My name is Mr Alistair J Whitehawk, CEO and co-founder of the Whitehawk Corporation but I’m a nice guy, so you can all just call me Alistair or Ali for short” We walked as he spoke, around the enormous factory floor. He continued his speech. “The Whitehawk corporation formally known as Whitehawk Industries was founded all the way back in 1916 by my great great grandfather, Sir Winston Whitehawk and his son Harvey a.k.a my dear father” 

I looked around, behind the hard hats and overalls, I recognised a fair amount of people who I went to college back home with as well as a few people who probably just moved to the town for a job and were probably on their first day. 



“Since then, Whitehawk Industries specialised in providing the best and only the best nuclear power structures, not only in the midwest, but the best the whole United States has ever had within its borders. After my old man retired and handed the company over to yours truly, I’ve been determined to not only upgrade nuclear power as we know it, but transport humanity itself into the year 3000. 



As we walked, we followed Ali through a set of double doors and found ourselves on a long metal platform and underneath it looked to be what I would assume to be a large pool, like the ones you get at gyms or waterparks but this was way deeper, well over twenty-five metres. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask Jerry what it was for



“This is the cooling tower,"" Jerry said. He shifted and glanced over the barrier into the fluorescent blue water



“Every nuclear power plant has one, It’s where the reactor sits, right at the bottom, The water keeps the fuel rods at a reasonable temperature” 



“Why is it so blue?” I asked 



“Cherekov’s Radiation is what they call it, The glow of the reactor causes light to be emitted with large concentrations at a specific wavelength. When the rods come out of the reactor after several years they ain’t gonna stop pumping out that radiation, in fact, they ain’t gonna stop for another hundred years or so, that’s for sure. So we just put em in water to keep em at bay, Just got to hope the water cycle keeps changing otherwise that water is gonna boil and we don’t want any more accidents”



“Anymore?” I asked. “So there have been accidents here?”



Jerry bit his lip nervously



“Let’s just say we’ve had a few incidents over the years”



I looked at him. He already understood that I wanted him to elaborate



“Some poor bastard fell in once, when the water filter was broken. This whole pool was filled with nuclear waste, the folks here refer to it as the 97 incident” 



“Did the guy survive?” I asked sheepishly 



Jerry then gave me a look of anxiety that made me realise that whoever this bloke was, he didn’t get lucky in the end



“I wouldn’t worry about it too much fella” Jerry said as he tried his best at some form of reassurance. “Since then, our health and safety policy has come a long way. We have special procedures for when any of our team handles anything around the area. Plus, only qualified individuals are permitted to enter the platform.”



Well, that was good enough for me, I guess.



As the day went on, we were shown what our assignments would be. As an intern, my job would be on the first floor, operating the various types of machinery used to transport radioactive supplements. It wasn’t bad at first, the machines were fairly easy to get my head around, and the pay was more than generous. I became friendly with the other workers. I already knew Jason and it was nice to familiarise myself with my other peers. One of them I learned was named Marcus. He must’ve been in his mid 20s or so. He was a latino guy who’d been struggling to make ends meet over in California and had relocated to Whitehawk after being offered a job, I also learned that he wasn’t actually qualified to work in the states but Ali had taken a chance on him because quote “everyone deserves the opportunity to make something of themselves” He seemed nice enough though. A good laugh and fun to be around as well. Henry and Joanna Ashbrook were both pretty cool once I got to know them. Joanna was loud and feisty whilst Henry was quieter and softly spoken. We ended up becoming good friends, which I guess is what you need in a work environment like this. Another was a stocky, bald, middle-aged mustached bloke named Biff. Biff, who I recognised from the picket line, was the boss of the Whitehawk Company Union and an avid believer of worker’s rights. 



I first encountered Biff when the guys and I were slacking off in the staff lounge. We were having a contest of  how many butterfinger bites each of us could carry in our mouths at one time. Juvenile? Sure, but we were off shift and we were bored. The moment came when Henry spat a whole bite out so hard that it flew across the room and hit the far wall. We all lost our shit which is when I heard the voice from the hallway.



“Can you shitheads keep the noise down?” Biff stood in the doorway, a scowl plastered across his face. “I’m out there leading the picket lines every morning tryin to keep you and all the other schmucks here from dyin, maybe you could stop these games and lift your weight a lil bit” He turned and carried on down the hallway and out of sight.

“That’s Biff” Joanna said formally as she sat down and sipped a paper cup of coffee. “He’s nice, I promise”



“Eh, He’s alright” Henry said in response. 



After about a week, things seemed to be going okay. I spent my afternoons off shift wandering about the town and exploring the nooks and crannies of the place. Everything seemed more old school than back home, the stores didn’t use contactless payments, I had to carry cash around on me at all times and the endless sprawl of strip malls and houses seemed to be an almost cartoonishly stereotypical American daydream. Then things started to take a rocky turn, I found myself getting nauseous whilst on the factory floor, the vast amounts of overprocessed snacks from the local 7/11 probably didn’t help sure, but this was different, Even after a good night sleep and countless cups of coffee and energy drinks from the Vending machine, I still felt tired all the time, Almost nodding off on various occasions. I began to experience headaches, migraines, stomach pain and nausea. It got to the point where I felt I couldn’t function and needed a break. I needed to find Jason. I hadn’t seen him in a few days. Apparently he had voluntarily slept over at the plant these past few nights, a lot of workers in the industry do so as I’m told. To “keep everything in order at all costs”. 



As I entered the staff lounge, I saw Henry sitting on one of the couches with a pen and a sticky note enthusiastically scrawling something on it. When he saw me walk in, he looked up and stopped what he was doing. . He and I were the only ones in the room, I sat down across from him with my head in my palm



“You good man?” Henry asked

“Yeah, Well, no, I’m not actually sure. For the past couple of days, I’ve just been feeling sick all the time.



“Yeah, we get that a lot, It’s what happens when you work in a place like this. Being around this much radioactive material all day everyday gets to your insides”

 

“You mean I’m breathing in these toxic fumes and that’s what’s making me sick?” I asked



“You got that right” he answered 



“Well, can’t we wear masks or something to avoid things like this happening?”



Henry looked at the floor.



“We tried that multiple times, heck, that’s what Biff is here for, to make the demand for better working conditions but Ali made budget cuts to reduce company spending a while back and said all us worker folk needed to make sacrifices, whatever in hell that means”



I zoned out in disbelief. What kind of boss would do this to their own employees? Was he trying to kill all of us? How in the fuck was this even allowed in the first place? Maybe, it’s being a stuffy European and all but I’m pretty sure none of this would ever fly back home. Health and safety is all we ever talk about whereas here, it seemed to be seen as some kind of privilege.

  


Henry looked over at me and sighed. “Look, I ain’t gonna pretend that I know Ali too well, I only work for the guy but if you go to his office and explain the situation, He might just let you take the afternoon off, he’s understanding like that”



“Alright man, see you at home later I guess”



“Sure thing fella” Henry replied 



He patted me on the shoulder as I left the room and made my way to the elevator that would take me to the basement floor where Mr Whitehawk’s office was located. As I made my way to the elevator and pressed the button for the floor I wanted, I felt something stuck to my back, something loose and crumpled. As I reached back to feel what it was, I realised it was a small piece of paper or more specifically, a sticky note. It was the same one Henry had been writing on as I walked in the room. I plucked it from my back and held it in front of me. What it said made my blood run 

cold. Written hastily in biro pen were the words: LEAVE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEAVE, WHILST YOU’RE STILL ABLE TO WITH YOUR LIFE.

1kv5t0g,https://i.redd.it/l2gycof16y2f1.jpeg,First Hamilton - Ventura Auto S,"I was wandering through an outlet in Paris when I stumbled across a few Hamiltons on display. I've always had a soft spot for the brand, the Khaki Field is a classic, Ben Stiller’s Pan Europ in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is one of my all-time favorites, and of course the Ventura is just iconic.

One particular watch caught my eye, it was a Ventura auto S that priced really well. At first I was like 'holy sh\*t, a cheap Ventura!!!', but this wasn't the Ventura I was familiar with. It was a more modern/sleeker take on the design (IMO), not quite the “classic” Ventura I’d always pictured owning. I was also worried it might wear too small on my wrist; 34x38mm case and a 14mm strap. Plus thanks to the unique shape strap replacements would be a bit of a nightmare. I'm used to wearing 40mm traditional round watches so I wasn’t sure it would suit me and decided to pass on it at first.

Still, as I kept browsing shops, sipping coffee and eating pastries (as one does in Paris), I couldn’t stop thinking about it. Eventually I went back and asked to try it on. To my surprise it wore a lot larger than the dimensions suggested, it didn’t feel that much smaller than the Speedmaster I had on. And honestly, I thought it looked amazing with the suit I was wearing.

I asked them to hold it for an hour while I “thought it over.” I was back in ten minutes.

I didn’t plan to buy a watch that day and I didn’t expect my first Hamilton to be this model of the Ventura, but I’m really glad it is.",3,1748188376.0,HamiltonWatches,0,1.0,False

When I select drinks like Cappuccino or Espresso Macchiato, the machine behaves unpredictably:

* Sometimes it froths the milk but then stops, without brewing the coffee.
* Other times it doesn’t froth the milk at all.
* Occasionally, it works perfectly.

I’ve noticed that during the process, the machine sometimes displays “I need to cool down” and just stops there.

Coffee-only drinks work perfectly every time.

I contacted DeLonghi support, and they blamed the LatteCrema carafe. They sent me a new one, but the problems continue. This seems like a more serious issue to me.

But none run more blindly than those who run from her. This is the tale of Tony Keller, a man who thought he could escape the inevitable.""

The first thing Tony remembered was waking up on cold pavement. Streetlights flickered above like stuttering stars. Rain patted gently against the earth. His car was nowhere in sight. No people. No sound. Only the long, empty stretch of Ashvale Avenue, lined with skeletal trees.

“Hello?” he called out, throat dry.

A voice answered—not loud.

“Your time has come, Tony Keller.”

Tony spun, heart punching his ribs. She stood at the end of the street. Her shape was that of a person carved from living shadow, her features lost in the black, save for two glowing white eyes that did not blink. No footsteps. No movement. Just her, watching.

Tony stumbled back. “What the hell are you?”

“I am Death,” she replied.

He laughed. Short, nervous. “You’re here to kill me, huh?”

Tony turned and ran. He didn’t look back. He couldn’t.

“I’m not ready!” Tony screamed.

“You already were,” her voice replied, from everywhere and nowhere. “It was peaceful, Tony. You didn’t even feel it.”

“Feel what?” he gasped. But he kept running. Streetlamps flickered as he passed them. His legs never tired, his lungs never burned.

He darted into a gas station—abandoned, flickering, the fluorescent light buzzing like a dying insect. Shelves of dust and rot. The register blinked 0:00.

He looked into a mirror behind the counter.

And saw nothing.

No reflection.

Only darkness.

“No,” he whispered. “No, no, no...”

The lights died.

“You don’t have to be afraid,” she said from behind him.

He turned slowly.

Death stood in the doorway, filling the frame like a painting made of midnight. Her eyes, not cruel—just tired. Patient.

“I don’t want to go,” Tony said, voice breaking. “I still have things to do. I have people.”

“You had,” she corrected gently. “You don’t belong there anymore.”

“You can’t make me!” he shouted, backing away. “You don’t get to decide!”

“I don’t,” she said. “I only come when it’s time.”

“Wake up!” he screamed. “Wake up, wake up!”

“You’re not asleep,” Death whispered. “You’re just lost.”

He found himself back in his house. Morning sun poured through the windows. He blinked. Coffee bubbled in the pot. A breeze stirred the curtains.

He exhaled.

“I made it,” he whispered. “I made it back.”

The door opened.

His wife walked in.

Carrying a black urn.

She didn’t see him.

She placed the urn on the mantle, next to a photo of Tony. She lit a candle. Said nothing.

Tony stood, frozen.

The wind stirred again.

Death stood behind him.

“It was quick,” she said softly. “No pain. A truck. Rain-slicked road. You swerved to avoid a deer. You saved a life. But yours ended there.”

He stared at the urn. At the photo. At the life he no longer had.

“No,” he breathed. “No, no...”

Death reached out a hand. Not forceful. Not cruel.

Just waiting.

“You ran long, Tony,” she said. “But you’ve reached the shore.”

Tony trembled. Looked at his wife, her tear-lined cheeks.

And then he took Death’s hand.

They vanished together, like a sigh in the wind.

1kv5pvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1kv5pvj/finally_completed_btech/,Finally completed B.Tech 💙,"Hello guys,

It’s surreal writing this. 

After 4 years at IIT that felt both like a blink and a lifetime, I’m finally graduating. 
No more 11:59 PM assignments. 
No more running to the mess just before it closes. 
No more walking around campus after 2 AM with music and memories playing in the background of my thoughts.

I still remember my first day here — nervous, excited, and completely unsure if I even belonged.

Over the years, I’ve made friends I can’t imagine life without, cried over subjects I never thought I’d pass, danced like no one was watching (sometimes literally during fests), and learned more outside the classroom than inside it.

From sleepless nights to finding peace. 
From feeling invisible to feeling unstoppable. 
I grew.

Before I log off, here are a few life lessons, and the moments I’ll carry with me forever:

##✨ Things I’ll Miss (and Never Expected To):

- Those deep 1 AM hostel corridor convos that somehow solved life.
- Random 3 AM walks to random places (yes, including the department terrace 🤫)
- Those group study sessions during exams with late night tea (Asima Peeps)
- Post-midsem breakdowns and random “Chal bhai ghoomne chalte hai” plans
- Dance practices that started at 9 PM and ended with 2 AM coffee from Nescafé 
- Nescafé ki Maggi, Banjara ka dosa, FC ka paneer parantha, ghext ki chai aur momos
- Wo fest mein pagal hokar dance karna aur phir toote huye pairon se hostel wapas aana… unforgettable.
- That rush after submitting last exam answer sheet
- The joy of seeing your name on the “selected” list after countless rejections.

Wo kabhi placement ki party, kabhi birthday party, kabhi SMP meet-ups, kabhi clubs meetups and many more countless things that cannot be listed here.

##🌱 What College Taught Me (Beyond the Books):

* It’s okay to not have it all figured out. **Embrace the chaos — it’s a part of the process.**
* Grades matter, but your mental health matters more. **Burnout isn’t a badge of honor. Rest is productive too.**
* People > CGPA. **The connections you build here — professors, peers, seniors — will shape your journey more than any textbook.**
* Try. Even if you’re scared. **Audition for that dance competition. Apply for that internship. Talk to that senior. You grow when you step in with trembling legs.**
* Stay sharp. Not everyone is your well-wisher. **In college, you meet all kinds of people — some kind, some manipulative. Beware of those who wear a mask of innocence but carry hidden intentions. Stay grounded, trust your instincts, and never let anyone dull your spark.**
* Make good habits and stay away from bad habits and bad circle. **Many good people adopt bad habits due to bad company just because they want to look cool and want to make memories. Try to avoid it.**

	
##🎓 Before I Log Off My College Email Forever… A Final Message to Juniors:

Slow down. 
Look around. 
Take more photos. 
Say yes to more things. 
You’re in a place where you can explore, fail, rise, love, cry, and still be okay.

College isn’t just about what you achieve — it’s about who you become.

**Don’t just survive college — live it.**

So here’s to the chai breaks, the fest nights, the terrifying vivas, the unforgettable friends, and everything in between. Logging off with the best life lessons and best friends for life.

To everyone still on the ride — trust me, you’ve got this. Live it well.

1kv5ob8,https://www.reddit.com/r/GCSE/comments/1kv5ob8/work_experience_applications/,Work experience applications,"So basically I’ve been trying to apply for jobs, volunteering and work experience for the summer recently but I’m 15 turning 16 in the summer. I’ve specified in my personal statement and cover emails when I will be 16 and that I’m willing to start anytime after that but I’m wondering if they will just see that I’m 15 and automatically reject that application? Some people have told me I’ve waited too long to apply but others have also said that I’ve done it too soon and they’ll just forget about my application. I’m online schooled so I don’t have any teachers that can help with this or getting in contact with people and it’s also my first time applying for anything like this (I did look into doing work experience in yr 10 btw but I was told that I was too young)

Any advice or tips would be much appreciated (I’ve applied to a pharmacy and 2 GP surgeries for work experience, a care home for volunteering, and a local coffee shop where my sister works for a summer job btw)",1,1748188036.0,GCSE,0,1.0,False
1kv5o4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaliciousCompliance/comments/1kv5o4m/make_me_be_part_of_the_fault_finding_team_imma/,Make me be part of the fault finding team? Imma gonna find dem faults!,"Most of my stories of Malicious Compliance seem to come from 3 jobs. This is another from when I was working in IT at the college.

It had been decided the world would be a better place if two of our campuses were merged into one. They were only a mile apart and the new site was 3 miles away, so there wasn't a big location issue. Sure, some people had a harder commute, but some got an easier commute. It's kind of equitable when you think about it.

To make the new build a rousing success there would be consultations, and people would be consulted, and everyone would be listened to. Yeah. You know that didn't happen without me telling you, don't you?

Each department was to send a representative to the New Build Consultation Group. Despite my best efforts to stay quiet or even absent every time the subject of a mandatory volunteer came up, I got voluntold to go. I, in all my mid-level position glory was to represent IT. Fine. I really didn't want to take part in a farce of a consultation so all the mistakes could be labelled as ""unforeseeable"". But if you're going to send a professional fault finder to a consultation I hope you have a full load of ink in that pen.

The meeting comprised 5 people from different departments and Susan, who worked in Facilities, so had been given the job of managing the new builds. No one seemed to think there was a significant difference between booking rooms for training courses, making sure coffee and lunch breaks were catered, and making a multi-million £ building come into existence and transfer hundreds of staff and thousands of students over to it.

After introductions, top of the agenda was parking. To be fair, I think it was smart to start with the contentious issue. Parking was already a problem and the rumour was there would be less parking at the new site. This would be solved, apparently, by not having any student parking. Ignoring the inconvenience this would cause, and questions over the public transport suitability, there was already not enough staff parking, so how was screwing over another group help us? After a bit of vague details about (somehow) rewarding car sharing, we were furnished with the magnus opus of technology that would solve all our issues; a gate with number plate recognition. THIS would stop all those pesky outsiders coming over 'ere and stealing all our spots. Something that had never been an issue. 

I'd been quiet until this point as I thought it all a bit daft, and I was formulating a plan out of the job anyway, so these issues were unlikely to affect me much. But now we had hit on some technology I felt the need to chime in.

I let the others ask their questions to understand how a number plate recognition gate works. For those not aware, it's a barrier with a camera. When you pull up it reads the number plate on the front of your car (all cars have a very standardised white front number plate in the UK), translates that picture to letters and numbers, looks it up in a database, and if it finds a match it opens the barrier.

Once everyone understood the technology I opened up with the problems in their happy-path only thinking.

OP: ""So Jan and I"" \*points thumb at unsuspecting woman sat next to me\* ""car share every day, and she drives. But today her car is broken, so we take mine. What happens when we get to the gate?""

Susan: ""What do you mean?""

OP: ""My number plate won't be in the system, so what happens?""

Susan: ""Well, it could be, even if you don't drive normally""

OP: ""That assumes a level of preparation. What if it's an emergency?""

Susan: ""There will be a call button. You can speak to someone to get let in.

I ignored the likelihood of that call system being managed, instead focusing on the loop-hole she'd just opened.

OP: ""So I'll just be let into this carefully controlled car park with limited spaces, based on my say so?"" 

Susan: ""Uhhh...""

OP: ""And you said I could have my number plate in the system""

Susan: ""Yes"", pleased to not be talking about the space issue again.

OP: ""Which one?""

Susan: ""Which what?""

OP: ""Which number plate? I have 2""

Susan: ""You do?""

OP: ""Yes""

Susan: ""Why?""

OP: ""Because it's illegal to use the same number plate on different vehicles""

Susan: ""Oh. Right""

OP: ""So can the system cope with more than 1 number plate""

Susan: ""I'll check on that""

While she took a note about the multiple vehicle issue I reloaded.

OP: ""Great. What if my other vehicle is a motorbike?""

Susan: ""I don't think that will be a problem""

OP: ""Yes, but I'm guessing the camera is on the gate and looking at the front?""

Susan: ""Um, yes""

OP: ""Motorbikes don't have front number plates. How will it read it and let me in?""

Susan: ""I'll check""

She then wrote another note and brought the meeting to an end, siting ""time"".

A few weeks later I heard from someone that there had been another New Build Consultation Group meeting. I hadn't been invited. Mission accomplished. 

Post note: The first winter at the new campus, 6 months after I'd left, I heard from ex-colleagues that the incline to the car park gate was so steep that when the first hint of ice turned up nobody could get up to and stop at the gate long enough for it to open before they started sliding back down into anyone following them!

1kv5ms0,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/1kv5ms0/attempted_amway_scheme_in_los_angeles/,Attempted Amway Scheme in Los Angeles,"Hey all - wanted to share this story to make sure everyone is informed that (sc)Amway is still alive and well in big cities and is being peddled by Gen Z. 

My husband and I live in LA. We're in our early thirties. I recently met a girl at the gym while we were both bench pressing, which is sometimes uncommon in weight rooms among women so I was happy to chat. She asked about the shirt I was wearing, branded with the university I work for - said a lot of her coworkers are grads from the school and wondered if I was an alum, too. Anyway, long story short she asked if I usually go on x weeknight, I said yes, we chatted a little more and I said I'd see her around. She asked if I have Instagram and we exchanged handles. Her profile was totally normal - she was a recent grad from a top 20 uni in Los Angeles and she's an accountant now. She was pretty extroverted, almost 10 years younger than me but friendly so I didn't think much of it - I have good friends in their late 40s so whatever. She sent me a message saying nice to meet you, if you and your husband ever want to grab coffee, we love getting to know new people in the area. TBH maybe I should have seen the signs. I know all about MLMs, I've heard the stories, I've read this sub - but no alarm bells were ringing. I thought she was friendly and maybe I should be open to having a new friend.

Fast forward, my schedule gets off so I haven't been in the gym at my usual time. I message her like hey, great meeting you - sorry I haven't been at the gym lately but see you next time! Just being nice. Again, she asks about coffee, so I'm like, sure - let's grab coffee. All week long I'm like, is this weird? Are these people swingers? Do they want to sell us a timeshare? I'm not even thinking MLM because wtf, young people are doing MLMs now? Since when? 

We met for coffee yesterday - my husband and I and this girl and her boyfriend. It starts off fine - they haven't been in LA for more than a year, we're talking about food, and they live in an area we used to live in so we have tons of restaurant recs for them. They're writing them down, it's all normal. When the topic veers into work, the tone suddenly shifts in a weird way. They are looking at each other and start talking about how they have day jobs, but it's really their side hustles they're focused on right now. I ask, genuinely, what is it you guys do on the side? She says they both have e-commerce businesses they were introduced to by their mentor. Right away I'm like......... Oh. Okay. I'm caught off guard so the subject is changed. Every so often, it veers back to this - dropping that they have a mentor who really sees business and personal growth mindset the same way they do. They've distanced themselves from friends lately because they don't have the same goals. We are nodding along like sure, sometimes that happens after college.... you grow apart... etc. But it's really giving MLM now and we aren't taking the bait. They ask about my job and I sing its praises. I say how much I love my work, my colleagues, and my boss. Case closed. 

Anyway, as we're wrapping up, the girl asks my husband (who is a personal trainer, self employed) if he ever recommends supplements or protein powder to his clients. He says, pointedly, no. We say goodbye with no invitation for a follow up meeting, hanging out, etc. As soon as we leave, I say to my husband ""I think we were about to get MLM'd"" but neither of us can quite believe it because they are so young and well-educated with good, normal jobs. 

I went home and googled her name - nothing came up. I did a quick search of ""approached by couple, e-commerce, reddit"" and boom, Amway. I google her name AGAIN + ""Amway"" and her storefront popped up. Ta-da! 

I'm honestly floored. I didn't know people were still getting into this shit. Under the guise of friendship, no less - I felt so genuinely repulsed and disgusted. If she messages me again, I will be telling her off - and now I have to change my gym schedule. I wish they had been swingers instead!

Big preference for voice chatting — I just think it's the best way to actually feel someone's vibe. If you're not down for that, no hard feelings, but probably not the right fit.

My wife didn’t want to come.

“I’ll hang back,” she said. “Water the plants. Binge Netflix. Watch the dog.”  
She’s 39. She’s not helpless. I thought I could leave her alone. I thought wrong.

The first missed check-in was small. I FaceTimed her on Day 2.  
She was in the kitchen, sweaty, flour all over her face. She smiled wide—too wide—and said she was ""baking bread the old-fashioned way.""

It wasn’t until later I realized she never used the oven.

She thought Epsom salt was yeast. She laughed when the bread cracked the marble counter and called it *Crumbzilla*. She placed it on the counter like a relic. I asked her if she was okay.  
She blinked slowly.  
“Better,” she said. “I’m cleansing.”

That night, the dog crawled under the bed and refused to come out.

By week two, the texts got stranger. She sent me a photo of a jar of carrot juice with the caption:  
**“the microbes are singing again.”**

She told me she’d gone raw vegan. Juicing exclusively.  
Nineteen pounds of produce. Half rotted.  
She juiced it all anyway. She stopped eating solids.

The **dog stopped eating too**.

And I swear—though I still don’t know how—**our fish changed color.** He used to be orange. Now he’s almost translucent. Like he’s been bleached by something unseen.

The robe appeared in every FaceTime. At first, it was white.  
Later, beige. Then brown.  
By the last call, it had blotches, like it was rotting, or growing.

She didn’t notice. Or she did, and didn’t care.

She had a scarf in her lap. Something she’d begun to knit with frantic, uneven stitching. “It’s helping me *ground the parasites*,” she said.

I thought she was joking. Until I saw the jar next to her.  
There were pickles in it. And something else. Something... twitching.

When I landed, I knew something was wrong the moment I walked in.

The house smelled like fermented soil, like vinegar and dying herbs. Like… decay pretending to be health.

She ran to greet me—robe flapping, eyes wild. She didn’t blink. Just pressed a jar of kombucha into my hand and whispered,  
“*Drink me.*”

The **dog wouldn’t come near her**. He pressed himself against my leg, trembling, eyes wide. He kept glancing at the fish tank. I looked too.

The **fish had buried himself under the gravel. Completely still**.

That night, I barely slept. I woke up to her in bed, burping softly in her sleep, repeating over and over:

*“I think I’m a kombucha now. I think I’m a kombucha now. I think I’m—”*

She never finished the sentence. Just smiled.

This morning, the dog dragged his bed into the bathroom and closed the door with his paw. I didn’t know dogs could do that.  
I swear I saw him lock it.

The fish was upside down when I checked, but when I tapped the tank, he snapped upright and pressed his face to the glass.  
I swear he mouthed something. I couldn’t hear it. But I felt it in my chest.  
**Run.**

I grabbed my keys and told her I was going out for coffee.

She nodded slowly and whispered,  
“Don’t forget the SCOBY.”

I don’t remember telling her I knew what that meant.

The **dog followed me**, no leash, no command.  
He got into the passenger seat like he’d been waiting for this moment for years.

We’re at the café now. He’s sitting beside me like a soldier returned from war. The **barista asked if I wanted oat milk**.  
I told him **no**.  
I have enough horror fermenting inside me already.

**I don’t want to go back.**

But part of me knows I have to. The plants are dead.  
The scarf is growing.  
The fish has stopped moving again—but his eyes are still watching me.

And my wife?  
She isn’t my wife anymore.

She’s something else.  
**Something brewed.**

1kv5llp,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kv5llp/explore_geesta_bwf100_water_filter_review_does_it/,Explore Geesta BWF100 Water Filter Review Does It Enhance Your Coffee’s Taste?,"The **Geesta BWF100 Premium 6-pack Water Filters** popped into my life in a hunt for a better cup of coffee and a solution to the relentless hard water buildup in my Breville espresso machine. After using these filters daily for over a month, I feel like I can provide an honest, no-fluff review of what to expect and whether they're worth adding to your coffee setup arsenal.

**Design and Compatibility**  
The first thing I noticed about these water filters is their compact and efficient design. At just 2.16”D x 1.37”W x 1.23”H, they fit easily inside my coffee machine without any hassle. They’re optimized for Breville machines like the BES920XL, BES870XL Barista, and even the Gourmet Single Cup Brewers BKC600XL and BKC700XL. If you own one of these models, these filters slot in like they were custom-made. There’s something to be said about the satisfying simplicity of an accessory that just works without fiddling around or forcing a fit.

**Benefits**  
- Improves coffee taste by reducing chlorine, sulfur, and iron odors.  
- Protects your machine from hard water buildup with ion exchange resin.  
- Each filter is individually sealed for freshness and quality assurance.  

This resin-based technology isn’t just jargon—it genuinely softened my hard water and removed that faint metallic taste I used to associate with my morning brew.

**Ease of Use**  
Installing these filters was a breeze. There’s no overcomplicated manual, and honestly, I feel like even someone completely new to water filters could manage this in seconds. I appreciated how each filter is individually sealed, ensuring that the resin beads inside stay fresh until you’re ready to use them. Once installed, I forgot about them, with the exception of setting a reminder to switch them out after 60 refills or every two months, whichever comes first. Living in a hard water area, I leaned towards the two-month timeline, and the best part was not needing to stress whether I was changing them too soon or too late.

[Want the lowest Geesta BWF100 price? Click Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b01hgiplaw/)

**Performance and Water Quality**  
Real talk, before switching to these filters, my espresso machine was practically begging for mercy due to hard water damage. After using these filters consistently, the obnoxious scale buildup drastically reduced. Also, the taste of the coffee noticeably improved—less bitterness and none of that underlying chalkiness I was unknowingly masking with endless sugar and cream. The ion exchange resin isn’t just marketing fluff either; it genuinely delivers results you can taste and see.

**Downsides**  
- Limited to certain Breville machines, so double-check compatibility before purchase.  
- Resin-based filters need to be replaced often in areas with extreme hard water, which could make it feel less economical for some users.  

While I loved the functionality, I did feel like constantly ordering replacements might be annoying for those of us who forget to stock up in advance.

**Product Competitors**  
Compared to other competing brands like Aquacrest filters or generic water filters sold in bulk, the Geesta BWF100 offers a balance of quality and performance that those cheaper options often miss. Aquacrest, for instance, has decent compatibility, but the resin quality feels substandard, leading to a lack of significant flavor improvement in the coffee. On the flip side, Breville-branded filters are undeniably excellent but come at a much steeper price point. Geesta bridges this gap nicely, providing premium resin performance at a mid-range price.

**Value for Money**  
One of the strongest selling points for these filters has to be the value they bring for their price. While I can’t drop specific numbers, you’re essentially softening your water, protecting your machine, and improving your coffee’s taste, all at a reasonable rate. Considering the potential repair costs for a calcified espresso machine, investing in these filters feels like a no-brainer for anyone serious about their morning brew.

College life is expensive, and I was constantly stressed about money. I didn’t want to give up my daily coffee or doing things with friends, but I needed to save.

Then I tried the “3-Bucket Budget” system:
	1.	Essentials: Rent, utilities, groceries.
	2.	Fun: Dining out, entertainment.
	3.	Savings: Even if it’s just $10 a week.

Every time I got paid, I divided my income into these three buckets. It made me more mindful of my spending without feeling deprived.

Over three months, I saved $300 and still enjoyed my life.

I’m sharing this because I know a lot of us are just trying to stay afloat right now, especially in the U.S. where everything’s expensive as hell.

Fast forward to today, the coffee shop is giving out coffee to promote their business and holding a fundraiser for the local hospital. I go and get my free coffee; the workers are blasting music, dancing, and drawing on car windows with chalk marker (with permission) as they work. Fun times happening. I chat with my friends who are working — they love it! The coffee is delicious. 
I come home with the cup in my hands and my parents are acting like I’ve done something evil. I put down the window and said “guess where I just went!” when I came home and my dad, who was in the driveway, stared at me, completely silent and seemingly dumbfounded, for like a solid minute, then snapped at me to put my window up. Didn’t talk for a while until he said something rude about them, to which I said “I’m not mad at them,” and he said, “I am.” Told my mom I went there and she gasped and said “No…..” as if I had committed a crime.
I’m so deeply confused by these reactions and can only assume I have broken some sort of social convention that I wasn’t aware of, because there is no way this is a big deal. I’m not mad, so why should anyone else be mad? Am I actually supposed to avoid giving them business? Am I not taking my rejection seriously enough? Did I break an unspoken rule?

It ain’t. Most of that stuff is made from the cheapest beans they can find—usually Robusta, which are real bitter and way higher in caffeine. They’re grown in bulk, sprayed heavy with pesticides, and honestly, they taste like dirt unless you drown ‘em in sugar or cream.

To make it “instant,” they brew big batches, then heat it till it dries out into powder. Problem is, that high heat kills off the good stuff—like antioxidants and flavor—and what you’re left with is just burnt caffeine dust.

And here’s where it gets shady: that process creates something called acrylamide. Look it up. It’s a chemical that’s been linked to nerve problems and even cancer in animals. Instant coffee tends to have more of it than regular brewed coffee.

Not to mention, a lot of that cheap coffee sits in storage too long, and mold can grow. That leads to mycotoxins, which mess with your brain, gut, and mood—especially if you’re already feeling run down. And if it ain’t organic? You’re getting a mouthful of pesticide with every sip. Some brands even test positive for heavy metals, like lead and cadmium.

So no, you’re not just having a cozy little cup of joe.

1kv567i,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kv567i/just_over_24_hours_split_across_yamadera_yamagata/,Just over 24 Hours Split Across Yamadera - Yamagata - Ginzan Onsen. Is rough outline too crazy?,"Apologies as this feels too built out for JTT - I'm weighing up if it's worth it to go to Ginzan Onsen in autumn (vs winter) for an overnight but I can't shake the feeling that I'll be sad to not try despite all the warnings from others. I'm trying to find a balance between making the most of my time without spending *too* much time. 

We're staying in Sendai and already planning a daytrip covering Risshaku-ji & Yamagata in 1 day, but now wondering if we could tack on an overnight stay at Ginzan as well. I managed to work out rough timings and it seems physically possible, but will this just be unenjoyable?

*  **9:12 - 10:17** : Sendai Station --> Risshaku-ji/Yamadera (inclusive of walk from station to temple). There's an option to take the 8:18 train which would get us to the temple by 9:30ish, but I erred on the side of caution to allow for coffee in the morning and slightly longer in bed.
* **10:17 - 13:17**: \~3 hours to explore Risshaku-ji based on feedback I've read suggesting 2-3 hours is needed.
* **13:50 - 14:12**: Yamadera --> Yamagata Station (inclusive of walk from temple to train). If it takes less time, we could either catch the 13:03 train that gets us to Yamagata by 13:31 or even the 12:26 that would get us to Yamagata at 13:12.
* **14:12 - 16:12**: Rough estimate that will change depending on how long previously we needed as well as when we decide to get the train to Ginzan (outlined below). At minimum, it'll be enough time to get us a quick bite to eat and do a bit of walking around near the train station area.
* **OPTION 1 - 16:33 - 17:11 (or 17:54 - 18:44)**: Yamagata Station --> Oishida Station where we would then get picked up by our Ryokan. Out of the 5 we were looking at, 3 of them will get us from Oishida station (and 1 of them said ideally we needed to be checked in by 18:00 to be in time for 18:30 dinner *or* if we were arriving later, would need to skip dinner). 
* **OPTION 2 - 16:22 - 18:24**: Yamagata Station --> Ginzan Onsen (including the change over to the bus at Oishida Station and the walk to the onsen from where we get off the bus)
* **18:30 - ?**: Check-in/dinner & Walk around. Private onsen (as we have tattoos).

  
The next morning, the plan would be to check out, walk around for a bit (if it turns out all shops, etc., are shut by the time we arrive and/or we want to shop and explore more), and then travel back to Yamagata. 10:30 seems to be the first opportunity out to head out so we'd have until then anyways. We would then explore Yamagata if there was more we wanted to see/do (depending on the day before) before taking the train back to Sendai in the late afternoon. 

  
I know the earlier train timings on the ""arrival"" day as well and can also skip Yamagata on ""arrival day"", saving it just for the way back on the ""departure day"". We will be leaving our stuff at our accommodation in Sendai even though it means double paying for rooms for 1 night, but means we can travel light and flexibly (and probably a drop in the bucket when all costs are factored in).

  
**Is there anything I'm massively overlooking about this plan? Has anybody done this and can share their experience?**



**ADDITIONAL/RELATED QUESTIONS** 

* There are other places we do want to do as half days from Sendai base, ***but*** none of them felt achievable enough to do on this day due to how long it'd take transport wise to get there from Ginzan - Any other suggestions of where might be good to go to *from* Ginzan in terms of ease of transport from Oishida Station?
* I was trying to find a replacement for Ginzan Onsen that I could do *instead* of Ginzan that would be possible between our previous base in Matsumoto and our next base in Sendai and found that Kusatsu Onsen might be nice. The main public onsens are tattoo friendly and it seems like a nice place to spend a few hours. Has anybody been to both Kusatsu and Ginzan and can tell me if Kusatsu is even remotely close experience wise as Ginzan? I've watched ""walking around"" videos and think I could still have a really good time in Kusatsu, but heard it's also busy/tourist heavy so I'm looking for somebody whose been to both that can give me highlights and lowlights of them compared to each other (as I'm struggling with my google search results).

**Why This Pick?**

The Giants come into this encounter with a substantial pitching advantage, friends. With Robbie Ray (2.67 ERA) on the mound at an impressive 6-0, this game should be light work for San Francisco. 3 of Nationals starter Michael Soroka’s (5.95 ERA overall, 7.20 Home ERA) last 4 outings have resulted in losses, and all by at least 2 runs. I’ve gotta run with the Giants for plus money here.

The desert was still sleeping.
The sun had only begun to rise above the jagged ridgelines of northern New Mexico, casting long golden fingers across a landscape untouched by time. Cracked earth stretched to the horizon, broken only by rust-colored buttes and a smattering of yucca and mesquite. There were no birds here, no towns, no passing traffic—just the dry whisper of wind over stone and a single rail line cutting across the terrain like a surgical scar.

Along that rail, a tram sliced through the silence.

It moved without wheels, riding a sheath of electromagnetic force. Silver and angular, the monorail bore no logos beyond a small circular insignia on its side: a black mesa silhouette inside a white field. Its windows were tinted and reinforced. Its doors were airlocked. This was not public transit. It was a sealed vein into the buried heart of one of the most secretive facilities in the western hemisphere.
Inside the tram sat a lone passenger.
Dr. Gordon Freeman.

Twenty-seven years old. Physicist. Former doctoral candidate at MIT’s Center for Theoretical Physics. Now, one of the youngest researchers in the Anomalous Materials Division of the Black Mesa Research Facility.
He sat still with his briefcase resting upright between his boots, a faint scuff visible on the metal latch—earned weeks ago when he'd clipped it on a stairwell corner. His dark hair was slightly unkempt from the early hour, and a faint shadow of sleeplessness haunted his eyes. He leaned back into the molded plastic seat and watched the shadow of the tram flicker across the canyon walls as the system curved into a tunnel.

The voice came over the intercom.
“Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System.”

Female, calm, and clinically neutral. A human facsimile, but not quite there. The kind of voice designed for routine announcements—yet hollow enough to feel out of place in an emergency. Gordon had heard it every morning for the last ten months.

“This automated train is provided for the comfort and convenience of Black Mesa personnel. The time is 8:47 AM. Current surface temperature is 64 degrees...”
It continued in the background, each phrase spaced with mechanical precision. He could recite it from memory by now. There was something almost meditative in it—repetition as reassurance. As if it were a charm meant to tame whatever secrets lurked below.
“This train is inbound from Level Three dormitories to Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities.”

Gordon rubbed his eyes, stinging from another short night. His alarm had gone off at 5:45. A quick shower. Two slices of dry toast. A quiet elevator ride from his dormitory to the transit level. And now, the tram. Always the tram.
It dipped sharply, descending into a shaft carved directly into the bedrock. Sodium lamps flickered past the windows in pale staccato bursts. Ahead, the tunnel widened into a massive underground hangar, its walls crowded with freight elevators, thick pipework, and scaffolding. Orange-vested workers wheeled crates across the floor beneath flickering hazard lights.

He barely looked at them. He'd seen it all before.

But even as his body rode the rhythm of routine, his mind remained elsewhere.
Today was different.

They were testing the Anti-Mass Spectrometer at full capacity. A move that had set nerves on edge throughout the department. The device was already a prototype—volatile even under controlled conditions. Pushing it beyond 100% capacity wasn’t just ambitious. It was reckless.
Reckless in the way that required waivers.
Kleiner had tried to reassure him. So had Eli. But Gordon had read the field equations. The power curve wasn’t just steep—it was exponential. If things went sideways, they wouldn’t go quietly.

The tram slowed again. Through the window, he saw a security guard crouched beside a malfunctioning access door, tools spread around him like spilled candy. The man looked up, recognized him, and grinned.
“Hey, Mr. Freeman!” he shouted over the din. “Catch me later, I’ll buy you a beer!”
Gordon nodded faintly. That was Barney Calhoun—a friendly face in a sea of technicians and analysts. He’d heard the man had once been an EMT before shifting to site security. He certainly didn’t act like someone who worked in a high-clearance facility.

The tram continued on, deeper into the artery of the complex.

“Please keep your limbs inside the train at all times. Do not exit until the tram has come to a full stop at the designated station.”
The intercom droned on as the final barrier loomed ahead—thick, reinforced glass supported by titanium struts. A green light blinked to life over a retinal scanner. The barrier lifted.

Sector C.

Steel bulkheads closed in on either side. Pipes hissed quietly. Scientists in white coats drifted through pressure-sealed doors, clutching tablets, dataslates, or thermos mugs. Armed guards watched from elevated catwalks, their rifles slung casually but eyes alert.
“Now arriving at Sector C Test Labs and Control Facilities. Please remain seated until the train has come to a full stop.”
The tram doors slid open with a hydraulic sigh.
Gordon stood, adjusted the strap on his briefcase, and stepped onto the platform.
A long corridor stretched before him—cool, sterile, and brightly lit. Status panels blinked along the walls, displaying data on containment thresholds, power draws, and atmospheric regulation. He passed two technicians deep in discussion and gave them a nod. Neither looked up.

He entered the locker room at the far end.
It smelled faintly of antiseptic and copper.
His locker stood near the back wall, stenciled in white block letters: FREEMAN

He opened it.

Inside, hung neatly on a magnetic clamp, was the HEV Mark IV Hazardous Environment Suit—orange, black, sleek. A full-body frame built to withstand extreme pressure, ambient radiation, biohazards, and minor explosive force. It bristled with biomonitors, automated injectors, and a compact reactor core for emergency energy supply.

The suit was the only reason any of them could work near unstable energy fields for longer than a minute.

Gordon began the process of sealing himself in.

Boots first. Gauntlets. Chestplate. The helmet clicked into place last.

The HUD flickered to life—orange-tinted and full of scrolling diagnostics.

“HEV Suit activated. Vital signs: monitoring. 

Power level: nominal. Automatic medical systems engaged.”

He flexed his gloved hands, rolling his shoulders to test the fit.

Then he stepped back into the hallway.
Dr. Isaac Kleiner was waiting.

Balding, wide-eyed, and perpetually harried, Kleiner looked up from his tablet as Gordon approached.

“Ah! There you are, Gordon. We were beginning to wonder if you’d missed the tram.” He pushed his glasses up with a knuckle. “You did receive the revised schedule memo, yes?”
“No,” Gordon said. “I don’t check email before coffee.”

Kleiner sighed but didn’t argue. “Well, never mind. The sample’s already been delivered to the test chamber. Eli’s nearly done calibrating the beam emitters. You’ll be taking the specimen down yourself for insertion.”
“Any idea what it is?”

Kleiner’s mouth twitched. “Classified. The Administrator delivered it personally. He wants the test run today. No delays.”
“Breen?”

“I don’t speculate,” Kleiner said briskly. “Now come along.”

They entered the elevator together.
As the lift descended, the hum in the walls grew stronger.

The Anti-Mass Spectrometer was waking up.
And in his chest, Gordon felt the math press in like a weight.

1kv4xpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/stroke/comments/1kv4xpm/strange_anxiety_two_years_after_stroke/,Strange anxiety two years after stroke,"Almost two years post stroke (ischemic thalamus and occipital lobe.) Recovery has been good and up until now I haven’t really had any mental or psychological deficits. 

Last week I had a day where I just felt off. I don’t know how to describe it but I didn’t feel like myself. Yesterday I took a long drive to see some old friends and on the way I started to get the same feeling and it made me really anxious. At one point I was considering pulling into a rest stop just to try and calm myself down. My lips were quivering and I thought maybe I had too much coffee or it was interacting with my meds. I powered through, got to my friends house and immediately felt better. In the evening I drove home and the anxiety returned. 

I am on vyvanse as well as aspirin and Lipitor but I’ve been taking the same meds for months. I also didn’t really have a racing heartbeat or any other related symptoms but I think I’m going to take a break from that to try and rule it out. I also doubt that’s it because the feeling returned hours later seemingly triggered by driving. 

One of my biggest fears after having a stroke is that it will change my personality and I’ve been so lucky in my recovery that I haven’t really had that happen but I’m starting to get worried that is what’s going on. 

Of course, I have a few things to do to try and figure this out (stop vyvanse and caffeine) but I’m wondering if any other survivors have had similar changes so far out from their stroke. ",1,1748186108.0,stroke,0,1.0,False

Im not sure how to take this...my LO is now 18months old and its been rough-  i dealt with infertility ,IVF, very uncomfortable pregnancy, post partum anxiety/depression...i think i had my last full night of sleep over 2years ago but thats whatever i guess.

One of my closest friends  (single no kids) texts me at least once every two weeks for us to get together for drinks or coffee and the nature of our friendship (before i became a mum) was that whenever we would meet we would have these deep discussions (mostly about her dating/career/family..which i dont really mind because im more of a listener and a bit shy about talking about myself) so whenever i brought my LO she would seem very frustrated because I would def be distracted. I usually do have the option to leave my son with his dad but to be honest my desire to hang out away from my son these past 18months has been very low ,i also think i have a tad bit of separation anxiety...its getting better now though.

Anyway, yesterday, after a couple of weeks of talking about it, I went to her house for coffee and she told me that her therapist told her to cut me off from he4 life because I was now bringing negativity to her life by not being available and the friendship has turned one sided...I was stunned... i am a first time mum and I have a toddler...she even threw in the statement that I am not the first person to be a mum and her other friends who are mums are more available than I am.

Her words were that  i have become toxicto her and am bringing negativity into her life  because her texts and missed calls can remain unreplied for days and i cant meet up with her as frequently as she wants/needs. I do want to be her friend but I just do not have the energy or the head space for it right now...how can i navigate this, i dont want to lose the friendship and i feel extremely bad but i guess I cant keep her hanging on...am i being selfish (toxic)?

Eventually, the guy managed on his own after a bit of awkward fumbling.

It got me thinking about that whole ""bystander apathy"" thing. Even in minor situations, it's like everyone waits for someone else to step in first. I wonder if it's a mix of not wanting to intrude or maybe thinking ""eh, someone else will help""? There's also that thing where you kinda look around waiting for social cues from others.

1kv4t8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1kv4t8q/looking_for_similar_experiences_that_ended_up/,Looking for similar experiences that ended up bring gallbladder related,"To start, I've had loose stool for at least a year maybe two now. Sometime I would go multiple times in the morning. Since my other symptoms started, I began taking a probiotic and psyllium husk, which seems to be firming things up, but some mornings I'm still having frequent loose ragged floating stools and even diarrhea. I drink quite a bit of coffee and struggle with anxiety, so I always wrote it off as a combination of the two. Otherwise, I think i eat pretty healthy, I'm active and relatively young- 36.

Now to the symptoms that recently started, in February I had a weird incident where I suddenly felt disoriented my anxiety spiked way up and I had a bad headache, slight dizziness, slight waves of nausea, and really bad fatigue. The fatigue and anxiety lasted about 3 weeks. At this same time I happened to be due for routine bloodwork, when I went in my liver enzymes were elevated. The doctor wanted me to wait a month and retest. During this time, my stomach started getting really noisy, slight discomfort on the right side of my stomach, under my right side ribs in the front and it eventually wrapped around to my back, shoulder blade, upper back, and shoulder. 

When I returned for the bloodwork, my liver enzymes when back to normal and since my RUQ had not subsided, I went in for a right side ultrasound. Everything came back clear. 

Since then I still have RUQ discomfort mostly in my back/shoulder blade but sometimes I'll feel a twinge of discomfort in my right rib in the front and back. My upper back, mostly on my right side also gets a burning stabbing feeling, but I sit at a desk all day and am not sure if that with a combination of tension from my anxiety is making it worse.

I can't really nail down if it's related to eating. My discomfort is pretty constant and seems to sometimes increase with food. For example, I recently had a spiced Chai almond protein drink and I had nausea, burping, back pain, and very loose stool the next morning. 

I'm waiting to go in for a HIDA scan, but I'm having pretty bad anxiety about having let my loose stool go on for so long without getting it checked out. I've got three kids and have been so busy with them and kept writing it off as a non-issue. I'm concerned this could be sometime worse and would love any advise from someone that has similar presentation.

I am confused,"From all the stories I have read here, it's manifesting there ex, which means with whom they had been in relationship and then broken up but my story is different so I need your advice if I should manifest or shouldn't as it is one sided.

So I met my SP last yr March. He is divorced and co-parenting as well. We both in our 40's. I am never married.

He only wanted FWB for which I agreed initially but with time, I fell in love with him. For a certain period, he too had strong feelings for me but never showed it to me. Once he realised that, he started distancing from me and slowly reduce his communication as well. When I inquired him, he said he feels I am too attached and that's not good and he doesn't want to hurt me. At that instance, I spilled him all the truth that I do love him and shower with love and care, but he said he can't love me. I asked him if he had feelings for me at any instance and his reply "" I have moved on."" 

When my heart was too heavy and I couldn't bear it, I message him or cry to him on wats app message and slowly reduced it as I felt I shouldn't be a pain to him.  
We met here in Reddit as strangers, met at a coffee shop there after, and then we were in communication through wats app and up until now he hasn't blocked me or anything. I have even told him to block me as I am troubling him but he never did. I know he is looking for some one on FWB. When I see him online on watsapp, my heart beats to the max as to whom he is chatting with..

I know what I am doing is wrong and one some days, I don't stalk and I just do SATS but I know I am doing with doubt and pain.. 

I am not sure, if it's worth manifesting him or not but to be honest, I love him from my heart.

Lastly I was thinking about the dobbermann boy. They're strong, independent, fierceful, mysterious, respectable, dominant guys, but often huge egoistic jerks. This would be a really good for physical protection, but for emotions it would be so bad.

And right now I'm a golden retriever boy, I care so much, I can be silly, I love deeply, but I also feel stupid and powerless this way. Like I know I'm smarter but this persona makes me feel dumb, and about powerlessness. I wanna protect who I love, and imagining a situation where I would need to be there for them (emotionally or physically) so I can protect them. It doesn't feel like a golden retriever boy can do that.

So I was thinking okay what about black cat boy. They're usually introverted, quiet, sensitive, good listeners, loves art, coffee, late night walk, music, deep thinkers and often melancholic. Which all of them are true for me (melancholic is a special situation because I was very pessimistic and melancholic but I forced myself to have this optimistic positive mindset). They would be great for emotional protection, but for physical? Not quite the respectful one.

Lastly I was thinking about the dobbermann boy. They're strong, independent, fierceful, mysterious, respectable, dominant guys, but often huge egoistic jerks. This would be a really good for physical protection, but for emotions it would be so bad.

So here I am thinking about the future. Which one I wanna choose. Later on I wanna have my own company, a family, with children, who I can provide for and protect them. And I was thinking okay let's mix the black cat and Dobermann personality together and have that. But honestly? I'm afraid that I fall back to that depressive state where I was before I forced this happy, positive, optimistic perosna on myself.

Between by two long term relationships, have not been actively dating for \~25 years, and was socially awkward as an adolescent.

There's a woman in one of my new social circles since becoming single this winter. I've talked with her a couple times and those went well. That particular group is on a summer hiatus, but I was happily surprised to see her manning a food truck outside my work yesterday! ... We had a good (and short) chat while I got something for lunch. A couple hours later I was done and there were no customers (at all - parking lot was empty), so we chatted a bit more and I asked her out to coffee. She very quickly said yes with a big smile, and just as quickly gave me her number when I asked.

I waited till she would have been done with her work that evening to text her. Let her know who was texting, hoped she had had a good afternoon, gave her a tldr version of my availability over the next week, and suggested a time.

I'm not really anxious (well, maybe a little), but was wondering about the etiquette of when to stop expecting a response, and whether it's appropriate (and if so, when) to send a follow up if there's no response.

It’s probably not your lack of food.

It's your lack of salt.

Here’s why electrolytes can make or break your fast — even if you're “doing everything right.”

# 1. your brain isn’t starving — it’s drying out

During a fast, your insulin drops.

Which is good.

But when insulin drops, your kidneys flush out water — and *with it* goes sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

So when you start dragging, getting irritated, or your head throbs by noon?

It’s not “low energy.” It’s low electrolytes.

# 2. black coffee doesn’t help — it makes it worse

Coffee’s a diuretic.

It pulls even more water and minerals out of your system.

So if your “fasting stack” is just black coffee and vibes?

You’re accidentally turbo-charging dehydration.

Especially if you train fasted or sweat even a little.

# 3. headaches, brain fog, irritability, and heart palpitations?

All possible signs of electrolyte imbalance.

You don’t need to pass out for something to be wrong.

Even mild imbalances can make fasting feel 10x harder than it needs to be.

And no, drinking more plain water doesn’t fix it. That just dilutes the minerals you do have left.

# 4. you don’t need sugar to hydrate properly

A lot of hydration powders come loaded with sugar.

But if you're fasting (or low-carb), that breaks your fast and spikes your insulin — kinda missing the point.

Electrolytes without sugar = hydration that still respects your fast.

Look for sodium, potassium, and magnesium. That’s it.

# 5. you don’t need a ton — but you do need the right kind

If you’ve ever added “just salt” to your water and gagged?

Yeah, same.

Some people go DIY (Himalayan salt, cream of tartar, magnesium citrate). Others prefer packets or pills.

Point is — a little salt + some potassium and magnesium = less brain fog, less crash, smoother fast.

Start light, especially if you’re not used to salty stuff.

# TL;DR

If your fasts suck and you’re ready to quit by 11 a.m.:

* It’s probably not hunger  
* You’re probably low on sodium, potassium, and magnesium  
* Coffee without electrolytes can *wreck* your fast  
* You don’t need sugar to hydrate — you just need minerals",1,1748185494.0,healthreviewz,0,1.0,False

Water alone doesn’t cut it. Coffee makes it worse.

That’s where electrolytes come in — specifically ones without sugar.

So I gave LMNT Recharge a try.

3 weeks. Daily dose during fasts. No food, no other drinks.

Here’s what actually went down.

# Week 1 – salty punch and skepticism

First stick? Tasted like a salty Gatorade punch to the face.

Honestly almost bailed right there — it was like drinking brine.

But I pushed through.

Didn’t get the usual 11 a.m. crash.

Normally I’m dragging and reaching for peanut butter. This time? Steady.

No food, no coffee. Just salty citrus water.

Still weirded out by the flavor but curious enough to keep going.

# Week 2 – no bonk, no cravings

Fasted workouts usually fry me.

But I trained hard, sweat buckets, and didn’t bonk.

Didn’t get that shaky-leg, post-deadlift wobble either.

No cramps. No need to sneak a banana after lifting.

Even upstairs walks during fasts didn’t leave me lightheaded like before.

Tried mango chili hot — surprisingly great. Sweet and salty heat.

# Week 3 – no 3 a.m. wakeups, no hunger spirals

At this point, it was automatic.

Stick in bottle. Sip all morning. No drama.

Didn’t feel edgy, didn’t feel drained.

Sleep was deeper too. Normally wake up around 3 a.m. — this week I didn’t.

Might’ve been placebo. Might’ve been the magnesium and sodium combo.

Either way, I wasn’t mad.

Also, forgot to eat till 1 p.m. more than once — and didn’t even notice.

# Why it worked for me

* 1000mg sodium actually *did* something — not just flavored water  
* Zero sugar meant my fast stayed clean, no crashes  
* No more mid-morning hunger spirals or brain fog  
* Didn’t feel like a stim — just solid hydration and balance  
* Flavors were hit or miss, but citrus and raspberry salt were fire cold  

# What didn’t hit

* $1.50 a serving started to sting by week 3  
* Some flavors were painfully salty — like licking a salt block  
* Chocolate ones were better hot, but still weird and hard to finish  
* Definitely not for anyone on a low-sodium plan  

# Final take

Thought this was overhyped Reddit bait at first.

But I felt better. Trained better. Even slept better.

It didn’t hype me up — it just stopped the crash.

If you fast, train, or live low carb, this fills a gap that plain water doesn’t.

1kv4hez,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1kv4hez/expect_the_unexpected/,Expect the unexpected,"Man, let me tell you about the time I let my ex crash at my place before she moved abroad. Yeah… sounds dumb already, right?

So, a few weeks back, my ex—hits me up out of nowhere. Says she’s got a plane ticket booked, she's leaving the country in a few weeks, but needs a place to stay until then. I hadn’t talked to her in a while, but I still cared. I figured, what’s a couple of weeks? It’s temporary, and she’s literally leaving the country.

So, I say yeah. Come stay. Just until your flight.
At first, it was chill. Almost too chill. She was polite, thanked me a lot, made coffee in the mornings like she used to. For a second, I felt like we were just two people who knew each other really well, sharing a space one last time.

But slowly, little things started to feel… off.
She was always on her phone, smiling at her screen like she was watching a rom-com I wasn’t invited to. She’d go out, come back late, sometimes not at all. And every time I’d ask how her day was, she’d brush it off or change the subject. I didn’t think much of it at first—I mean, she’s leaving. Maybe she’s trying to soak up her last days here.
Then one night, I’m doing dishes and her phone lights up on the counter. A message preview pops up—“Can’t wait to wake up next to you again.” Heart emoji. From a guy. 

Yeah.

Turns out she had a new boyfriend. I was just the layover. The safe, convenient, familiar place to crash before she started her new life.

I didn’t say anything right away. I was more stunned than mad. Like… how do you not even mention that? Here I am thinking I’m doing something decent for someone I used to love, and she’s using my couch as the waiting room for her next relationship.

What really got me? The way she acted like nothing was off. Like I didn’t deserve at least a heads-up. One night, she’s heading out with her little suitcase and says, “I’ll be back late, don’t wait up,” with that same smile she used to give me when we were still together.

That’s when it clicked: she wasn’t staying here because she had no one else. She was staying here because she knew I wouldn’t say no.

A couple days before her flight, I told her she’d need to find somewhere else to stay. She tried to guilt me—said it was “only two more nights,” that I was overreacting. But by then, I was done playing the fool.

She left without much of a goodbye. And yeah, it stung a little. But honestly? The moment she walked out, it felt like I finally closed a chapter that had been half-open for way too long.

So yeah—lesson learned: never be the soft place to land for someone who’s already flying toward someone else.

Two minutes.

""Show me,"" I said suddenly. ""Show me what it really means.""

Dale raised an eyebrow. ""Show you what?""

""The network. The customers. What I'd really be signing up for.""

""It's risky,"" Dale said. ""Once you see the full scope, you can't unsee it.""

""I need to know.""

One minute.

Dale led me through a hidden door to a corridor lined with windows. Each showed a different location, a different night shift worker, different strange customers – maritime travelers, time travelers, extradimensional refugees. Hundreds of nodes, hundreds of guardians.

""This is what you're joining,"" Dale said. ""A community of guardians, guides, rule-followers.""

We stopped at a window showing our store. The other Marcus sat calmly. Dawn approached.

""Time's up,"" Dale said gently.

Then the window flickered. The other Marcus was gone, replaced by a frightened woman fumbling with rules. Tommy Chen entered, translucent. He presented thirteen items; she refused, not knowing the rule. He began to fade. Miguel's truck pulled up, fading too, Miguel confused. Other strange vehicles shimmered uncertainly.

""This is what occurs when someone unprepared takes your position,"" Dale explained. ""The rules aren't arbitrary. They maintain connections for beings who exist partially in our reality. Without proper management... Tommy will fade completely. Miguel will forget his purpose. Your grandmother will lose her connection to family memory.""

""Make it stop.""

""I can't. This is what happens when the network fails.""

The scene was horrifying – not monsters, but dissolution, the unraveling of purpose.

""Change it back.""

Dale smiled. ""Only you can do that.""

6:00 AM had passed. Dawn broke in the real store. Here, time suspended.

""I'll do it,"" I said. ""I'll take the position.""

""Are you certain? Once you take those keys, your old life ends.""

""I'm certain.""

The window flickered back to the other Marcus. He looked up, nodded. We walked back. Each window now showed successful operations.

At the door, Dale paused. ""The keys connect you to every node. You'll know when others need help. You'll feel disruptions. Sometimes you'll travel.""

""I understand.""

""Eventually, you'll train your replacement. Probably family.""

We stepped back into the store. The other Marcus extended the keys. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""I've been tired.""

I took the keys. They were heavy, warm. Information flooded my mind – the network, the managers, the thousands of travelers depending on us. The other Marcus began to fade, stepping sideways.

""Will I see you again?""

""Perhaps. In dreams."" He smiled, at peace. ""Take care of them, Marcus. They need us."" He faded completely.

Dale handed me a new name tag: ""Marcus Chen, Night Manager. Network Node 47-B."" He mentioned the upstairs apartment, my old life handled.

The phone rang. I answered automatically. ""Buc-ee's, Highway 35, Marcus speaking.""

""Node 47-B, this is Node 23-A. Code 7 situation. Can you spare some travelers?""

I understood instinctively. ""How many and what type?""

""Three time-slips and a reality refugee. Need safe passage west.""

""Send them through. I'll have rooms prepared.""

""Thank you, 47-B. Central dispatch, out.""

I hung up. Dale grinned. ""Natural talent.""

The store felt different, larger. New controls appeared. ""Your first official shift starts tonight,"" Dale said. He'd stay a week. ""Then you're on your own. But never alone."" He gave me a thick manual. ""Reading it will come naturally now.""

Tommy Chen's truck pulled in. I saw both versions – solid and ethereal. He waved, a real smile this time. ""He knows,"" Dale said. ""You're one of them now.""

Miguel's truck followed. His wife's faint outline sat beside him. The letter lady – my grandmother – materialized from a shadow.

""Ready for your first official customer?""

I straightened my tag. ""What can I get you today, Grandma?""

""Just a coffee, dear. And a chance to welcome you properly to the family business.""

As I poured, I knew this wasn't an ending. It was the beginning. Dawn broke, but for travelers, night never ends. Neither would my shift.

The next week blurred. Days meant nothing. The upstairs apartment expanded based on need – library, workshop, observation deck showing true highway traffic: stage coaches, buses with changing seasons, motorcycles casting wing shadows.

Calls came from other nodes – wildlife slipping dimensions, temporal distortions. But the regulars taught me most. Tommy carried memories and network data across time. Miguel carried prayers, his wife now a constant presence. Grandmother Chen delivered letters between generations, warning of future travelers.

New customers appeared – a woman selling books from parallel worlds, a teenager moving refugees, an old man from a non-existent country. Each required different handling.

Dr. Katherine Voss, a physicist from a reality where science made magic possible, arrived every other Friday. She studied confluence points, setting up equipment that sang harmonic tones when distant travelers passed. Dale approved her; she'd stabilized seventeen nodes.

One week in, my first emergency call at 3:33 AM. ""Level 5 reality breach. Multiple travelers displaced from a collapsing pocket dimension. Twenty individuals.""

""Twenty people? I don't have room.""

""Check your back room.""

A new door appeared, leading to a small hotel lobby. ""Emergency housing unit active.""

They came – families, individuals, human-like but subtly wrong. I handled registration, room keys appearing with specific needs: gravity adjustments, atmosphere changes, chromatic translation. Within an hour, all twenty were housed.

""You handled that well,"" Dale said. ""Most new managers panic.""

""It felt natural. Like the building wanted to help.""

""The nodes are living things. The more attuned you become, the more it responds.""

By dawn, all were relocated. The unit folded away. A thank-you note arrived with a stone that changed color based on reality stability. Green meant normal.

Two weeks in, Director Sarah Reyes appeared for my evaluation. She noted my aisle modifications for non-standard physiology. ""Innovative. Customer satisfaction scores exceptional. Regional recommendation: fast-track for advanced training."" She gave me a Level 2 pin that showed network info.

The stone flickered yellow. A customer I'd never seen entered – a young woman with a violin-telescope instrument.

""Welcome to Node 47-B,"" I said. ""What can I help you find tonight?""

She smiled, colors in her eyes. ""I'm looking for the highway to yesterday.""

I consulted the manual, drew her a map that made no sense to my old reality. Just another night.

Three months in, I thought I'd seen everything. I was wrong.

The stone turned orange – unmentioned in manuals. Dr. Voss's equipment sang discordantly. Static on the radio formed patterns.

Tommy Chen arrived. Behind him, seven identical trucks, seven Tommys. ""The network's experiencing a convergence,"" he explained. They bought maps from different decades. ""Someone's trying to collapse the spaces between realities.""

Miguel arrived with three trucks, each carrying a different version of his wife. They spoke as one voice: ""The Tuesday routes are merging. Someone is pulling the paths together.""

Dr. Voss arrived, her vehicle bristling with concept-weapons. ""Lock down your node. Reality predator."" It fed on spaces between worlds, drawing timeline versions together to collapse the node. ""You're the anchor point. It can't attack you directly, but it can manipulate customers' timelines.""

Grandmother Chen entered with two other versions – young, middle-aged, ancient. They carried letters spanning decades. ""The family network is being pulled apart."" Every Chen who worked night shifts, connected across time. The youngest handed me a letter in my own handwriting: ""Trust the rules, not the realities.""

More customers arrived in groups – multiple versions of every regular. The store filled with temporal echoes. Janet the book seller in five versions, Alex as child, teen, adult. The purple-eyed travelers appeared.

""Convergence accelerating,"" Dr. Voss announced. ""Twenty minutes.""

""What do I do? Nothing in training covered this.""

""Check the manual,"" a Tommy suggested. ""The one the network itself provides.""

A binder appeared on the counter: ""Emergency Protocols for Node Anchors."" I found the section.

""The rules,"" I said aloud, understanding flooding me. ""Enforce the original rules, on all timeline versions simultaneously.""

Dr. Voss nodded grimly. ""The predator counts on contradiction.""

""But I'm one person.""

""You're the node anchor,"" the eldest Grandmother said. ""You exist in all timelines as long as this location does.""

I felt it – a stretching. I saw through the eyes of myself in every timeline where Node 47-B existed. Dozens of Marcuses, facing convergence. The rules became physical laws. I felt them connecting me to every customer, every version.

""Tommy,"" I called to all seven, ""you know the thirteen-item rule."" They synchronized, their trucks solidifying.

""Miguel,"" I addressed the three, ""Tuesday routes. All of them."" They moved in pattern, all three wives visible.

Rule by rule, I enforced them across every timeline. Coffee stopped dripping red, coolers locked at midnight, reflectionless customers vanished. Dr. Voss's equipment hummed in harmony. ""It's working. Stabilizing.""

The predator's attention focused on me – hunger given form. *You cannot prevent the collapse.*

""Maybe,"" I said aloud. ""But you haven't consumed this one. And you won't.""

I reached for the original seven rules. They were fundamental constants. Rule by rule, I reinforced them across all timelines. The predator's influence weakened. Timeline versions merged back into primary selves. Tommy's seven trucks became one, existing fully in multiple realities. Miguel's versions unified, his wife constant. Grandmother Chen's echoes resolved into one form holding all her ages.

The orange pulse faded to green. Dr. Voss's equipment returned to gentle melodies. Static cleared.

*This is not over,* the predator's voice faded. *The network has many nodes.*

""But not this one,"" I said firmly.

Dr. Voss packed up. ""Impressive work, Mr. Chen. Class VIII convergence event single-handedly.""

""I had help.""

""You had customers who trusted you,"" Dale said, appearing. ""That trust is something you earned.""

Outside, the highway returned to normal. My shift was ending. Dawn approached. But I knew normal was relative.

I locked the manual away, filed my report, prepared for a quieter night. Almost a century of strange customers awaited.

Five years have passed. Time loses meaning. The convergence deepened my network connection. I've trained three junior managers – Lisa, Jackson, my college roommate David.

The store expanded – three buildings connected by folded space. Building One for normal customers, Two for network travelers, Three for admin/emergency.

Dr. Voss set up permanently, mapping dimensional layers, identifying new threats: time storms, parasites, meaning vampires.

Grandmother visits, bringing letters. Last week, from my great-granddaughter in 2087, warning of ""The Blank Road.""

Tommy Chen's route expanded; he carries network data and refugees. His truck is a mobile embassy. Miguel's route evolved; his wife is solid beside him. They deliver peace to troubled nodes.

Purple-eyed travelers are regular customers, adapting to our physics. I've met the Manager of Node Prime in Tibet, running her station over four hundred years.

I can step sideways into other realities, visit nodes instantly, attend conferences between dimensions. But I always return here.

Last month, orders came to train my replacement. I'm promoted to Regional Coordinator, managing seventeen nodes.

But tonight feels different. The stone flickers strange colors – deep purples, shifting golds. Dr. Voss's equipment reacts to unknown patterns. Three customers asked about ""The Night Market."" None of the manuals mention it.

At 2:47 AM, a vehicle arrives – not truck, not bus, shifting form. An elderly woman emerges, coat woven from starlight. She enters, looks directly at me.

""Marcus Chen, Node Manager 47-B.""

""Yes ma'am. What can I help you find tonight?""

""I'm here about the Night Market. It's time.""

""Time for what?""

She smiles, her eyes holding depths like the network corridor. ""Time for you to learn what lies beyond the network itself. What all of this has been preparing you for.""

She hands me an envelope sealed with wax that shifts colors. ""Open this when you're ready for the next level of strange.""

She returns to her vehicle. It drives away without sound, fading from one position to another until it disappears.

I hold the envelope, feeling its weight – not physical, but the weight of choice. The stone settles on a steady blue glow – stability, the end of one chapter.

Outside, Tommy Chen's truck approaches. Behind him, lights I've never noticed – writing messages in color and movement.

I place the envelope in my pocket next to the original rules. Those rules still matter.

The doors chime, welcoming Tommy. I look up, smile.

""Evening, Marcus,"" he says. ""Ready for another strange night?""

I touch the envelope.

""Always am, Tommy. Always am.""

The Night Market can wait. Serving strange travelers who need a safe place, who need to remember they're not alone? That will always be the most important rule.",1,1748184916.0,Ruleshorror,1,1.0,False

Putting myself out there a bit. I'm a 37-year-old guy living in London. Life's pretty good, but it's always nice to meet new people, right?

A few things I enjoy:

Swimming: You'll often find me doing laps at the local pool – it's my go-to for clearing my head and staying active. Always happy to chat about good spots or even find a swimming buddy.
Photography: I love capturing moments and a bit of the world around me. You can get a feel for my style over on my Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/
Reading: I'm a big fan of history, and I'm currently making my way through ""Revolutionary Spring"" by Christopher Clark. It's a fascinating look at 1848 in Europe. Always up for book recommendations or a good discussion.
Beyond that, I enjoy exploring London's never-ending offerings, decent coffee, and good conversation.

Looking to connect with friendly, interesting people for chats, maybe a coffee or a walk, and see where things go. Whether you share some of these interests or have completely different ones you're passionate about, I'm open to hearing from you.

If any of this resonates, feel free to send a message and tell me a bit about yourself. What are you reading/watching/listening to lately?

1kv4fvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/healthreviewz/comments/1kv4fvf/why_your_multivitamin_might_be_doing_nothing_and/,Why your multivitamin might be doing nothing (and how to fix it),"So you’re taking a multivitamin every day.

Maybe it’s a “men’s ultra performance” label. Maybe it’s from the grocery store.

But you feel… nothing.

Still tired. Still foggy. Still randomly craving chips at 10pm.

Here’s why that could be happening—and how to actually get something out of your multi.

# 1. You’re overdosing the wrong things, and underdosing the right ones

Most generic multis load up on B12 (like 2000% of your DV) and toss in trace amounts of magnesium or zinc.

Problem is—your body can’t store huge doses of water-soluble vitamins forever. And those missing trace minerals? They're often the things you’re actually low on.

So yeah, your B12 is through the roof… but your magnesium is in the gutter. No wonder you still feel flat.

# 2. You’re taking it with the wrong meal (or no food at all)

Some vitamins absorb best with fat (like A, D, E, K).

If you’re downing your capsule with black coffee and dry toast, you’re wasting half the formula.

Take your multi with an actual meal—especially one with some healthy fat. Avocado, eggs, even olive oil will do.

Bonus: stop taking it before bed unless it says to. Some multis can disrupt sleep, especially ones with iron or B-complex blends.

# 3. Your gut can’t actually absorb it well

This one sucks, but it’s real.

Your gut bacteria play a huge role in how you absorb nutrients.

If your digestion is off, your multi might be just sliding through your system doing zero.

Some people benefit from multis that include prebiotics or fermented ingredients. But honestly? Even fixing your fiber intake and staying hydrated helps a lot more than you'd think.

# 4. You’re taking a “one size fits all” formula

There’s a reason a women’s formula often includes iron and a men’s doesn’t.

But even beyond that—your body might have different needs based on diet, activity, even stress.

Training hard? You might need more magnesium, not a mega-dose of niacin.

Vegan? Watch your B12, iodine, and zinc.

A generic pill designed for “everyone” often helps no one.

# 5. You’re expecting it to feel like caffeine

A multi isn’t a stim.

You won’t get a rush. You won’t feel laser focus 30 minutes later.

Most benefits build slowly. Fewer energy dips, better sleep, less irritability, fewer cravings.

The problem? These are *subtle wins*, not fireworks. And if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss them.

# TL;DR

If your multivitamin isn’t doing anything:

* Check the actual ingredient breakdown (not just %DV)  
* Take it with a full meal that has some fat  
* Pay attention to gut health and absorption  
* Don’t expect stimulant-style “effects”  
* Track stuff like mood, cravings, and sleep over time",1,1748184805.0,healthreviewz,0,1.0,False

I got my diagnosis about two months ago, 71 Ahi per hour and had my appointment with the sleep nurse this week. I started the cpap on Tuesday. 

First night I used the nose plugs and woke up with a very sore nose, so changed over to the pillow and actually got better stats from the app and no sore nose! Great! Last night I got 98 score on the myair app 

My issue at the moment is that I am way more exhausted than before I started using the cpap. I feel like my mornings aren't as rough as they were before but I'm crashing by the afternoon. Went to a family coffee today and I could barely keep my eyes open and fell asleep in the car over (I wasn't driving). 

Ive read online that it's kind of a gets worse before it gets better thing and persistence is the key, but is this really normal? I don't feel like myself and not in a positive way.

Is anyone else feeling this connection between Rent and Butter Miracle? I noticed this thing the other day while listening to the entire album but hit me hard when Bobby and the Rat-Kings came on.  It's the music.  It's the lyrics and especially the line about the lights.  The melody feels familiar...and connected to something in Rent.

So I've been living in Vietnam for 6 months now. About 3 months back I made a very dumb mistake and definitely inhaled mold, intensely. I'd never had issues with mold before, never considered it's harmful nature. 
I sat down to work on a project in our new Airbnb we were renting for the month. The table to sit at was about 4 or 5 feet away from the AC unit, with the vent directly blowing into my face. AC units in Vietnam are attached to the ceiling and wall; long rectangles with a slot for air and an angled vent cover. 
Well, I noticed a musty smell and thought nothing of it. So I started working... 8 hours a day, sitting there in front of it, breathing it in... For 2 weeks. 
I started getting warning symptoms and panic attacks and I had no idea what or why they were happening. 
Our AC unit starts leaking so I let them know and they come to clean it. They take it into the bathroom and spray out pure black tar from it. It never even occurred to me this unit had never been cleaned, because this Airbnb was brand new (just remodeled)... But I guess the AC unit was used. 
The picture I'm adding of the inside of the unit should probably terrify you....
So, after the cleaning I assumed everything was fine (again,not understanding mold at all) so I went back to sitting there. 

My wife cooks some fettuccine alfredo and then I eat a slice of cake.... Those of you that know will not be surprised how this affected me with a mold infection: tingling in jaw, in arm, in fingers, panic attack, racing heart (above 140bpm, for a full half hour). I thought I was having a heart attack and rushed to the hospital. 

They told me I'm fine, just a panic attack. My brain did not connect the dots yet about mold. 

So I continued to stay in that apartment. I continued to sit in front of the AC (which was clean now I thought). And I continued eating food that feeds fungus.

I went back to the hospital three times. They gave me a new diagnosis each time. 

Symptoms I was constantly getting: My jaw would clench and my lower jaw tingle. (When I told them this they sent me to a specialist to check for Tetanus and Rabies.)
My lips tingle, the tip of my tongue tingles, my heart rate spikes very fast, my ears feel stuffed. 

They do an xray of my chest, see possible bronchitis, give me antibiotics. Follow up xray a week later shows it's clear. I tell them about my symptoms again, they send me to an ENT, he tells me I have Rhinitis and gives me antibiotics. 

I tell them about my racing heart, they do an ultrasound. Tell me I'm fine, it must be a panic attack. 

I ask for an ultrasound of my legs (to check for thrombosis/stroke). They claim I have vericose veins and give me pills for that. 

I tell them my left arm forearm constantly feels agitated, like it feels wet on the muscle, but my skin is dry. They do an ultrasound: nothing. 

----------------
Summary of Ongoing Symptoms and Medical History:

I’ve been experiencing a range of recurring symptoms that come and go, including:

Jaw and Oral Sensations:

Frequent jaw clenching and tightness, especially in the lower jaw

Tingling in the lower jaw, lips, tip of the tongue, and sometimes the entire left side of the jaw

Occasional difficulty swallowing and fully closing my jaw

Sensation in my lips like I’ve licked them too much


Cardiovascular Symptoms:

Heart rate spikes rapidly

Blood pressure as high as 160/94

Occasional chest tightness


Respiratory and Sinus Issues:

Difficulty breathing through the nose

Sinus pressure, especially in the mornings (right nostril often feels swollen)

Chest inflammation previously diagnosed as possible bronchitis

Episodes of fever, coughing, sore throat

Diagnosed with rhinitis and pharyngitis (prescribed antibiotics twice, which helped but didn’t resolve symptoms completely)


Neurological Sensations:

Persistent tingling and pins-and-needles sensations, mainly on the left side of the body:

Left arm (forearm near the elbow, bicep, near the thumb)

Left foot (especially toes)

Sensation of fullness, warmth, and cold in the left arm and foot


Right side of the neck feels slightly swollen

Head pressure without headache

No numbness, pain, or dizziness


Other Concerns:

Episodes of nausea

Generalized anxiety and panic-like symptoms

---

Medical Tests and Responses:

Jaw Symptoms: Referred to a specialist to rule out tetanus and rabies

Chest X-ray: Initial inflammation noted (suspected bronchitis); follow-up X-ray showed clear results

ENT Consultation: Diagnosed with rhinitis; prescribed antibiotics

Heart Ultrasound: Normal results; symptoms attributed to panic attacks

Leg Ultrasound: Done upon request to rule out thrombosis; diagnosed with varicose veins and given medication

Arm Ultrasound (for tingling/wet sensation in forearm): No findings



---

Medication History:

Previously on Amlodipine besylate for high blood pressure for two years

Discontinued due to daily nausea and persistence of other symptoms
----------------

After 5 hospital visits and constant panic and  I start reaching out to strangers on the internet. Finally. FINALLY. Someone with experience tells me about mold toxicity. Then another person. Then another. 

So the issue? Vietnamese don't understand mold. They live in humidity with little to no AC their while lives. Most have a dry cough their entire life. There are virtually no doctorsiaround that even comprehend the issue. 

I do some research and put together a list of tests I want run to see what's happening inside of me.... 
I ask 4 different hospitals about the tests. Not a single doctor has any idea what these tess are. 
Except Candida. They offer me foot cream. 
I special order tests that they have to contact the countries capital city hospitals to find. The hospital there says they have the test, but they've never used it before. 

I can't get a mycotoxin test. I have trouble finding a stool test. 

Finally I get confirmation they can test my blood for Candida and Aspergillus IgG and IgM. 

The results show elevated IgG indicating a previous infection. 

My Aspergillus level is 58.2 (above 50 and below 70 is the grey zone, indicatingprecent exposure). 

They still have NO IDEA how to treat it. 

But my guy does. A stranger on a forum. He comes over to help. First we tackle me moving to a new apartment and disinfecting the fuck out of it before I move in. He brings an O3 generator and  runs it for 45 minutes while we go out for a coffee. Then he opens all the windows while I wait outside and I let the apartment breathe overnight. 
Next day I have a protocol. 
-------------
What I was told about treating my home to be mold free:
Mold must be killed with vinegar, or mold spray. Avoid using bleach. 
Every wall surface and ceiling must be wiped with vinegar
The floor must be mopped with vinegar, and then after 5 minutes it can be mopped with cleaning solutions
The curtains must be cleaned entirely with vinegar. The front and back. 
The top of every object must be cleaned. Every door hinge, every cabinet, every electric outlet. 
The wood peice in the living room must be cleaned thoroughly. 
The sink must be thoroughly scrubbed in the corners to kill the mold. 
The kitchen cabinets need to be cleaned underneath as well as above. 
Every window sill needs to be cleaned. 
The window by the bathroom needs to be thoroughly cleaned. The walls need to be scrubbed. 
The cabinet under the bathroom sink needs to be cleaned. 
The rollers for the curtains must be thoroughly cleaned. 
Anywhere that has a crack (wherever wood touches) must be cleaned carefully: mirrors, doors, cabinets. 
The AC units, taken apart, sprayed thoroughly, left to sit in vinegar. 

Me and my wife and a cleaning crew spend 8 hours cleaning. The next day we do it again. 

--------------

My new health protocol:
Food choices are fresh chicken. Quinoa. Broccoli. Duck eggs. Water with salt and sometimes fresh like juice. Green Tea. Coconut oil or olive oil for cooking. 

Seasonings allowed: Himalayan salt, turmeric, cumin, Basil, oregeno, cilantro. 
I have pork rinds as a snack too. Specialty expensive ones without preservatives and only 3 ingredients (seasoning). 

No iodized salt. No dairy. No yeast or bread. No mushrooms. No nightshade plants (tomatoes, bell peppers). Nothing can be in my fridge longer than a day if it's been cooked. My histamine tolerance is FUCKED. If I have ANYTHING with histamines I get tingly lips/tongue, headache, racing heart, fingers tingle, lymph nodes feel swollen, jaw tingles, fingers tingle, left foot gets pins and needles. It SUCKS. 
-------------
I have a rotating supplement stock that I have to adjust daily based on my reactions:
Berberine, liver detox (milk thistle, dandelion, etc), vitamin d3, vitamin c, Quercetin, bromelain, serrapeptase, stinging nettle, apple cider vinegar, coconut oil, zyrtec (only if necessary), flucanazole, magnesium glycinate. I can't get DAO enzymes in Vietnam, and the cost to buy them from Amazon or eBay after shipping is ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. 

I keep a detailed log daily of all my symptoms and severity, foods I ate, drugs and doses, and various notes about activities. 

I go to the gym every other day, I get full body massages, I take Epsom salt baths followed by cold showers. I went to a natural hot spring (that shit fucked me up for days). I go to the beach for an hour almost every day and just stand in the water and sun. 

I run everything through chatgpt 3-7 times a day to help manage and adjust my doses and plan my day. 

---------

It is now day 41 since I started treatment and moved into a mold free Home. I've lost 23lbs. Once a week we spray everywhere with vinegar and clean the apartment in full. Every day we sweep and clean surfaces. 

I am FINALLY starting to feel human again. Only in the last 10 days have I stopped having random night panic attacks. Only in the last 7 days have I stopped waking up with tingling jaw or other symptoms. 

----------

tLDR: moved from US to Vietnam with no knowledge of mold, became exposed to high levels of Aspergillus. Doctors and hospitals kept misdiagnosis me for 2 months. Been on an antifungal journey the last 40 days and still struggling daily to figure everything out daily. 
I use chatgpt to check in about my symptoms and assist me with managing them and timing the right dosages of my supplements. 

-------------

Please, if you slogged through all of this, I hope it helps you in some way. And if you have any suggestions or advice or questions, I'm listening 🙂

Today is the first day I have gone full carnivore and my breakfast was 175g of 15% beef cooked with 4 tbsp butter and 2 eggs, plus 4 slices of pre-cooked turkey (I am not buying this again as I only noticed now in the ingredients it has other crap added in so I’ll be cooking everything myself from now on). I also had a coffee with lactose free milk. I still had stomach pain after eating but much less than usual and also only slight bloating and almost no gas thank god. The only thing is it’s 4pm on the first day of this diet and I am already feeling very tired, my diet has always been 80% carbs. What can I do to combat this? I’m scared I will do something wrong and make myself more sick. However I know that NOTHING has worked for me so far, no other diet, no medication, nothing. Carnivore is the only thing I haven’t tried yet and I’ve read a lot of stories where people cure their IBS with this. I hope this works for me.",8,1748184503.0,carnivorediet,17,1.0,False

Same scoop. Same brand. No punch anymore.

Turns out, it’s not the powder.

Here’s what could actually be killing your pre-workout effects (even if the label hasn’t changed):

# 1. You’ve nuked your caffeine tolerance

If you're sipping coffee, energy drinks, AND tossing a stim-heavy pre on top?

Yeah. That 250–350 mg caffeine blast isn’t doing much anymore.

When your adenosine receptors are constantly blocked, your body adapts fast.

You end up chasing that first-week high and never quite get it.

Sometimes a week-long caffeine reset (yes, brutal) can *fully* reset sensitivity.

# 2. You're under-slept or overstressed

No one likes hearing this, but if your sleep’s garbage or you’re in burnout mode?

No amount of beta-alanine tingles or citrulline pumps will save you.

Cortisol and sleep debt flatten response to stims.

Pre-workout becomes a crutch instead of a boost — and your body just stops reacting.

# 3. Your stomach’s not absorbing it properly

Taking it on a full stomach?

Slamming it with a big meal?

You might be delaying or dulling absorption, especially with stuff like caffeine, tyrosine, or theanine.

Try taking it 30–45 min pre-workout on a mostly empty stomach.

Or at least don’t shotgun it after a bowl of pasta.

# 4. Ingredient synergy is off

A lot of new blends are super stacked… but not always smartly.

If you’re mixing a pre with a fat burner, or taking other adaptogens nootropics, they might compete or counteract each other.

Some combos (like high-dose L-theanine + stimulants) can *blunt* the energy.

Check what else you’re stacking — even calming supplements can dull the kick.

# 5. You’re just used to the feeling

The first few times you take a pre — everything hits.

Tingles, rush, motivation.

But after a few weeks, you stop “feeling” it… even though it’s working.

Just because you don’t get a head buzz doesn’t mean the nitric oxide or focus blend isn’t doing its job.

We train ourselves to expect fireworks, and when it’s just a smooth lift — we assume it’s not working.

# TL;DR

If your pre feels like it stopped working:

* Cut back on other caffeine for a bit  
* Fix your sleep and stress (unsexy but necessary)  
* Don’t take it with a huge meal  
* Double-check your stacks aren’t clashing  
* And don’t expect magic every time — sometimes “no crash” is the win",1,1748184476.0,preworkoutz,0,1.0,False
1kv4afs,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kv4afs/my28f_boyfriends28m_sisters_25f_22f_20f_hate_me/,"My(28F) boyfriend's(28M) sisters (25F, 22F, 20F) hate me but they have every right to do so because I cheated on him, is there any way for me to win them over?","Hello, Reddit! I didn't realize it had gotten so long but I did my best to shorten it so pls bare with me, I'm in desperate need of advice and outside perspective on the situation.

*tl;dr: I cheated on my amazing boyfriend back in college due to deep insecurities. He broke up with me, and we lost contact. Years later, we reconnected at work, talked things through, and eventually got back together. His sisters, who used to like me, are now strongly against our relationship. What can I do to win them over?*

My (28F) boyfriend, Adam (28M), and I met during our first year of college and started dating the year after. He was popular, kind, and well-loved by everyone. I was introverted, overweight, insecure, and never thought someone like him would notice me. We first met at a craft store because we were both into crocheting, something he picked up from his sisters. From then on, we grew closer and eventually started dating.

His friends and family welcomed me, including his sisters, who I kept in touch with regularly. But my insecurities made me a difficult partner. I compared myself to every girl he interacted with and often picked fights. I eventually opened up to him about my struggles, and during that time, I began working on myself. I lost weight, learned to dress better, and gained confidence. I started receiving male attention I've never gotten in my life, and I was relishing it. I ended up cheating on him at a party we went to together, and he caught me making out with some other guy. I begged and pleaded with him but he remained steadfast in us breaking up. I lost an amazing and loving boyfriend, and our shared circle of friends.

Back to the present, I met Adam again because I left my previous job and ended up working in the same company as him. We exchanged awkward greetings but I approached him later on to apologize again for the hurt I've caused. He accepted my apology and that was that. I didn't really expect to regain contact with him again but I received a notification on Instagram that he had followed me and sent me a message (Hurrah, the block has been lifted). Basically, he told me that he has long forgiven me and that it was nice to see me doing well in life. I thanked him and asked if he would be open to having coffee with me and he agreed. Disclaimer, I didn't do this in the hopes of getting back together with him, I simply wanted a proper catch up with him and expected that after this, we wouldn't stay in contact but we did. When we realize how we felt for each other, we had intense and difficult conversations. From this, I he made it clear that trusting me again with his heart is a huge testament to how strong his feelings are for me. As evident by this post, we ended up getting back together and have been together for about four months now.

He was hesitant to tell his friends and especially his sisters. When he did, his friends were lukewarm at first but came around. His sisters, on the other hand, were upset. Still, he convinced them to meet me over dinner. I think it went as well as it could. They weren't rude or unengaged with me, they asked me questions and included me in the conversation. Though, it kinda felt like they were there as a courtesy to Adam rather than to genuinely get to know me again but I see this as a crack in the door, rather than a lock on it.

On to the crux of the issue, Adam talked to his sisters about our meet up and my boyfriend was a little hesitant to tell me about it but did so upon my insistence. They said that Adam could do so much better than ""some thankless cheater"" and people like me don't deserve second chances. Adam insisted that I'm a changed person, and they only kept replying with ""so? and?"" and said other things too. While all the things they said hurt, I honestly can't blame them. Adam reassured me that while he does value his sisters' opinions, ultimately, he wants us to be together and that is a decision he is making wholeheartedly. That means the world to me but at the same time, I can feel how difficult this is for him. He's very close with his sisters and values their relationship a lot and I see the tension I've caused between them is hurting him a lot.

I love Adam more than anything and I so badly want to win his sisters over but I don't want to overstep or do anything that would make things worse. I've told him about this but he just says to let it be, that they'll come around too, just like his friends, but I don't want to be a source of conflict between them. I also don't want to seem like I'm passive about this or that I'm hiding behind their brother. I tried reaching out to his sisters on social media but they've blocked me (which they hadn't done from our previous break up).

Any clues on why?","Hey guys. Since 4 years ago I've been running every week (edit: in the gym). I was running 3km per week up till last year, where I increased it to 4km. But I ended up having to lower my pace to 7:00 just to complete the run fully.

My runs don't vary very often, I usually last only up till the very end. But every year, out of my 52 runs, around 3 to 4 of them will be insanely good, where I can just run endlessly. All of those runs I've hit 10km or more at \~6:00 pace, and I still do not feel like I need to stop. **Several were after a poor night's sleep and on an empty stomach.** The week after and before, my runs are shoddy as always.

I'm trying to figure out why. I recorded the most recent one:

* It was a day after I had really bad hay fever. My nose was completely blocked and leaking, and because of it I felt nauseous before the run.
* I slept 4 hours the night before due to my hay fever.
* I went out and walked for around 10k steps before my run. I felt pretty tired and my legs were sore.
* I had pasta for lunch.
* I had coffee 2 hours before my run.
* It was evening.

I tried to replicate it by having coffee 15 min before my evening run. I ate congee for lunch, slept 6 hours (not too great but better than that good run day), warmed up all the same, *the day before* I walked 10k steps. But when I ran, I ended up having to pause at 3km because I was so breathless.

Long shot, but anyone have a clue why - if not, share with me what influences your good runs? I've read many posts and it says good sleep, eat before you run, but these runs just are so much of an anomaly that I really want to know why.",2,1748184382.0,runninglifestyle,5,1.0,False

Some were caffeine bombs. Some just gave me headaches.

But Mind Lab Pro? This one kept popping up across Reddit.

So I grabbed a bottle.

Vegan caps. No stimulants. Just 11 research-backed ingredients.

Two capsules each morning, no stack, no coffee.

Here’s how the full 14 days went.

# Day 1–2: Clean slate

No high. No crash. No jolt.

Just smooth.

My brain felt quiet. Like someone hit the mute button on background noise.

Was it placebo? Maybe. But it was different from my usual mornings.

No racing thoughts. No grogginess. Just calm and clear.

Not gonna lie, I kept checking in like: is this it?

Almost stopped by Day 2 thinking it was too subtle.

# Day 3–5: Friction drops

The biggest change was how I moved through work.

I didn’t stall or procrastinate.

Started a task, stayed with it.

Emails got finished. Not half-drafted and abandoned.

One afternoon I cleared my inbox without rage-quitting halfway through.

Less resistance. Not superhuman focus, just less struggle.

And I didn’t need to reach for caffeine.

# Day 6–7: Sleep and recall

Dreams got weirdly vivid.

I started remembering full sequences when I woke up.

Short-term memory was sharper too.

Didn’t forget names, links, or random info mid-task.

Could be Bacopa. Could be the B vitamins.

Whatever it was, it felt natural.

# Day 8–11: Real clarity

This was the tipping point.

No more fog.

I could jump between tabs, projects, even meetings, without feeling scrambled.

Did a 2-hour Zoom meeting without zoning out once.

It didn’t make me faster. It made me cleaner.

Felt like my brain wasn’t fighting me.

No coffee crashes either.

# Day 12–13: Flow days

Writing was smoother.

Even on bad sleep, I wasn’t mentally fried.

Didn’t hit that usual 4 p.m. slump.

Just kept going at a steady, focused pace.

I wasn’t hyped. I was synced.

That’s the best way to describe it.

# Day 14: Final take

This isn’t a magic pill.

You won’t wake up a genius.

But you will feel different. And better.

I noticed more mental stamina. Less background noise.

Fewer moments of zoning out.

Some days I honestly wasn’t sure if it was working or if I just had better sleep.

But the pattern was clear.

If you want something that keeps your brain in gear without hype or crash, it’s worth a test run.

# What I liked

* Clean formula, no caffeine or sketchy herbs  
* Lion’s Mane and Citicoline felt well-dosed  
* Sleep quality actually improved  
* Balanced energy, no wired feeling  
* Easy to take, didn’t upset my stomach  

# What bugged me

* Bacopa dose is only 150 mg (clinical dose is 300 mg)  
* Takes time, not instant gratification  
* $69 a bottle is steep for long-term use  

# Would I use it again?

Yes, but not daily.

It’s a great tool for deep work phases, deadlines, or study sprints.

Not something I’d rely on every day, but definitely something I trust when I need to perform.

The best part?

I didn’t feel like I needed coffee the entire two weeks.

I’m hopping to hear few options from professional baristas on these...

1. Why does recommendation for espresso ratio vary so much? You can usually find people/sites saying 1:2 is the starting point and that for darker, more intense coffees you want to go even lower than that. On the other hand, many sites/people say the most common espresso recipe is 7g into 25-30ml (even wiki page says that), which is roughly 1:4 ratio. That is quite a difference. Why some claim you want to go 1:1 or 1:1.5 with dark, intense roast and then wiki and half an italian espresso guides teach 1:4 for their dark/intense roasts? Btw if should follow 1:1.5 ratio with 7 grams of beans, my espresso would be 10,5ml in volume! That is ridiculous. What am i missing here?
2. Second thing i have been curious about for a long time: what is ""lungo"" exactly? From my experience, 90% cafes (at least in city of Prague) will just dilute espresso with water, if you order lungo. Shouldnt that be called small americano or just a diluted espresso? Is lungo, where you increase extraction time and ratio just an Italian thing? What they teach baristas these days? And how do you prefer to prepare lungo yourself? Does it depends on equipment or type of coffee? Is it prevalent to just dilute an expresso and call it lungo, because its easier and you dont have to mess with grinder settings?",5,1748184106.0,barista,4,0.86,False

I mainly am glad to be gone, I love my sundays with all my coffee and sleeping in and going to lunch with people. This Mother's Day I went I'm so fucking glad I'm don't believe that misogynistic bs or am constantly surround by people who do (though my parents do). I'm gay, I love not having to hide it from the local Mormons, while I'm still closeted to my family, it's a relief to not be completely closeted. I also see all the evidence against Mormonism, and religion in general and I say yay I'm not falling into those traps. I enjoy these things, especially after the intial guilt (though I still do feel guilt, hence the next paragraph). 

But I feel guilty about stuff all the time, I get panicky when I'm being visibly gay and there's a Mormon. I miss prayer, I miss believing, I miss having a way to automatically get comfort and advice, I miss having a large network of people who are meant to support me, I miss feeling comfortable about death. While some of the things are kind of like I want them and I know religion in general can help, like comfort about death, Mormonism just mainly caused panic abt the kingdoms.

Last Christmas my first one out of the church, I felt shitty bc of me being out of the church. I generally was having a rough time then I saw the fact that my family wasn't, they were praying and enjoying the religious aspect of Christmas and I felt guilty to them and felt remorse about the fact I left like I wanted to join back in. 

An acquaintance had offer me and a few others to go to a Friendsgiving at his church. I said no but for a while now I've been considering to ask him about his church, and regret not going to Friendsgiving. I want to join some random Christian church but I can't bc I know it's not true, also I disagree with lots of Christian values and I would like to avoid homophobia.

I sometimes pray, while they mostly consist of ""dear Heavenly Father, why the fuck am I praying"" shit need to restart, ""dear Heavenly Father, help?"", ""dear Heavenly Father, I'm here with a broken heart and contrite spirit, help?"" I miss being able to wholeheartedly pray and get the comfort from that. In fact I think part of the reason I self harmed was because it was like prayer and I was going through losing prayer (I still am), it's ritualistic, releasing feelings, comforting, and unlike prayer has real instant physical proof of it working. Well I'm currently trying to stop doing that and I thought for a bit I should make myself a way to pray. I kinda tried that like making my own little religion, but didn't get very far. Because it's hard to just make up something to worship, it takes effort to make your own little Ten Commandments, and own way to pray, I'm not Joseph smith, making a religion is hard. 

I feel lost and I'm worried I'm going to go back to Mormonism or go to some random Christian church and I'm going to becoming invested into something I don't believe, my emotions will cloud evidence. I feel guilty and shitty when I see others enjoy their religion, I wish I could pray.

TLDR: I want to go back to Mormonism or religion in general sometimes because of missing things that came with it, especially prayer.

""humans are not special, we're like animals, so why can't we eat them like other animals eat each other?""

Ignoring the fact that this argument conflates the law with morality, it is clearly legal and moral in the US to use the products of child exploitation. If the idea is we are not special, but we are to treat animals like we treat children, then if you indulge any of these industries when it is practicable and practical to not do so, then you are saying it is OK to exploit animals as you exploit children. Essentially, it's ethical to exploit animals so long as it's done halfway around the world.

Also, the idea of ""Fair Trade"" has been seen to be dubious at best and Ruth supply chains as such, not even FairPhone can guarantee a child slavery free product. None of these industries can. Essentially if you're eating mass ag food and not locally made, in season foods, you're consuming something which is the product of child labour. If you consume mass ag so you can afford a greater diversity of food and to afford other luxury items (vacation, drinking, drugs, gaming, etc.) then you are contributing to child exploitation for the sake of pleasure. Lastly, if you buy second hand and beleieve this ameliorates the ethical burden, what's the difference between that and purchasing leather or even meat second hand (eg eatting someone's leftovers, etc.)? 

Some of the industries which exploit children and are endemic to the supply chain/industries used in the IS are:

1kv43gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kv43gr/nobody_leaves_whitehawk_springs_pt_12/,Nobody Leaves Whitehawk Springs PT 1/2,"Where do I even start with this? Everything I am about to tell you is one hundred percent non-fiction, even though I so desperately want it not to be true. A dream. A figment of my imagination, if you will. I’m going to put my cards down on the table and fully admit that right now, I’m more frightened, cold, isolated and alone than I’ve ever been before and it’s all because I made the trip across the pond and ended up in this almost unheard of town in the arse end of the American midwest. Ohio, to be specific. A town by the name of Whitehawk Springs. A remote city nestled within the heart of the state. Not a big town whatsoever. A population of around 36,000 maybe? Those figures might not be entirely accurate, but you get the point. 



For a bit of context, I grew up in a relatively socially depraved area of South London. My mother died when I was around six and not long after is when my father walked out on me. Since then being raised by my Aunt. I love that woman to death and want more than anything in the world to be with her again right now. Over the years, let’s just say, I’ve had my fair share of “issues”.



It’s no secret that growing up working class in the inner city is a very “dog eat dog” kind of life where you have to toughen up and be ready to defend yourself to avoid being mauled to death (usually by pimps or loan sharks if not literal feral Kaynines). So when the opportunity to take a temporary escape from this life came along, I was more than on board.  



It started in college with the student exchange program. Designed to give disenfranchised young people from broken homes the opportunity to broaden their horizons. As in, a troubled kid from somewhere overseas gets to experience life here and someone like me would fly half way around the world to end up working on a farm somewhere, at least that’s what I assumed at the time. I’d just turned eighteen years old and what I wanted more than anything was to be able to decompress and live my life, just for a bit, instead of looking over my shoulder 24/7. 



So that’s exactly what I did. I woke up at around 5 in the morning, said my goodbyes to my aunt and set off to spend some time overseas for around 4 weeks or so. I travelled to the airport with around six other students who were also taking part in the program. Our college instructor, Tracey, gave us all words of encouragement “I went to America when I was your age and had the time of my life, but be prepared, even though we speak a common language, Americans are about as foreign as the Russians”.  At this point, I knew very little about the United States in general, let alone Ohio. All I had to base my expectations off of was the vast catalog of American movies and TV I grew up watching. You know, the typical slices of Americana that are constantly drip-fed all across the globe through popular culture. The white pickett fences, the freshly cut lawns and the endless stretch of roads and houses that seem to go on for miles. Suburbia. The American dream. Quite a different reality to life in South London. 



I ended up flying for around 9 hours on a British airways flight non-stop to Chicago international. I arrived at around 7:45 in the morning, jetlagged and exhausted. It wasn’t the worst journey I’d ever experienced (not that I had that much experience anyway) . The dude I was seated next to on the plane, who was also part of the program I learned was called Jason. We quickly started chatting and became friends. Jason had also grown up in South London and was here for the exact same reason as me. I think most of the students here had the same mindset. 

After leaving the airport, we boarded a coach and drove for around 5 and a half hours before finally arriving in Whitehawk Springs. From the very first time I laid my eyes upon the sign-post for the town’s entrance, a part of me wondered what I’d gotten myself into. “A very warm welcome to the settlement of Whitehawk Springs, Home of the Whitehawk Corporation” 

When I signed on to this trip, I had no idea that Whitehawk was a company town, not that I even really knew what a company town was, being from another country and all. The whole concept was rather alien to me at least. Another thing that caught me off guard was the amount of American flags literally everywhere, as well as the amount of religious paraphernalia that littered almost every front yard. On the whole, I knew Americans were generally more religious than the Brits but to this extent, I wasn’t prepared for. 



Soon enough, I came to my stop and learned that Jason and I would be staying in the same home with the same family who were called the Ashbrooks. They consisted of Jerry and Darline Ashbrook and their two adult children. Henry and Joanna, ages 18 and 19 respectively. As soon as Jason and I started up the long, heavily tarmaced driveway, Jerry and Darline appeared to greet us. Darline, a petite woman with a bob-style haircut was the first to embrace us, each both in enormous bearhugs and donning a smile that was so aggressive, it might as well have been forced. The house was huge, and to someone who grew up in a British council house, it seemed like a mansion. A wooden porch snaked around the entirety of the house with a beige cushioned porch-chair to the left of the front door swaying lightly in the wind. Jerry smiled. He was a tall bloke, around 6,1. His hair greased back across his scalp with a single curled strand laying across the left side of his forehead. He wore a pair of thick black-rimmed coke-bottle glasses and a grey suit with a red tie neatly tucked underneath his jacket. Jerry shook both our hands and introduced himself, Henry and Joanna. As we went inside, we were shown to our room which we’d be sharing, a spacious room at the back of the house with two single beds, both of which had nicely wrapped picnic baskets full of various snacks and baked goods, much to our delight. 



Dinner that night was also amazing. Turkey, mashed potato, cranberry sauce, mac and cheese, it was all there. Everything was incredible. It was everything the movies depicted. Almost too accurate. I remember Jason and I joking about it being like living in a real-life version of The Truman Show, and, to be honest, we weren’t far off in that regard.



The next day, we learned that we’d be spending our days, not in a traditional American high school or a community college but instead, all overseas students would be training as interns for the Whitehawk Corporation, this was a company town after all and Jerry, it turned out, was the deputy executive on the company board, Darline was a stay-at-home housewife of course, there to maintain the garden, clean the house and cook the evening meals consisting of a more than generous helping of carbs and red meat. So much for feminism. We learned that Henry and Joanna would be our guides since they were already employees at the company and had been for quite some time. We were given our uniforms, Navy blue overalls with our names stitched onto the left side of the chest and we were good to go. 



We got in the Ashbrook family car, a 1950s DeSoto custom station wagon and drove for around 25 minutes to the Whitehawk Company HQ. During the drive, I couldn’t help but notice the excessive array of numerous fast food establishments that lined the highway. I must’ve counted around fifteen at least. All with drivethroughs. Pavements, or “sidewalks” seemed completely absent. No room for walking here. In Whitehawk, the automobile was the primary choice of transportation. 



When we arrived at the Whitehawk Company HQ, We were greeted by a large herd of people in hard-hats and high-vis jackets all standing in a cluster by the front gate. A good number of them were wielding various signs on placards stapled to wooden posts. I couldn’t quite make-out what they said but they seemed to be shouting or rather chanting in unison. 



“Eh, god damn unions” Jerry muttered to himself as he navigated the vehicle at a steady pace around the block to avoid any kind of coalition with any of the people. We pulled up at the gates and were greeted by a security guard sitting in a booth. Jerry flashed his keycard and the barrier lifted letting us through to the parking lot.



 a mandatory introduction for all new trainees by the head of the company. Mr Alistair J Whitehawk was the first thing on the table as soon as we entered the building. Mr Whitehawk was a shorter bloke, possibly around 5’6 and had a short black, neatly groomed circular beard plastered firmly across his face. He wore a dark, blue velvet suit and a pair of brown loafers. The dress-style of a man with more than a bit of personal wealth. 



“Welcome, all these new faces” He declared, in his upper class American accent. I figured he probably went to Harvard or some other fancy college that someone like myself could only ever dream of being accepted into. 



“My name is Mr Alistair J Whitehawk, CEO and co-founder of the Whitehawk Corporation but I’m a nice guy, so you can all just call me Alistair or Ali for short” We walked as he spoke, around the enormous factory floor. He continued his speech. “The Whitehawk corporation formally known as Whitehawk Industries was founded all the way back in 1916 by my great great grandfather, Sir Winston Whitehawk and his son Harvey a.k.a my dear father” 

I looked around, behind the hard hats and overalls, I recognised a fair amount of people who I went to college back home with as well as a few people who probably just moved to the town for a job and were probably on their first day. 



“Since then, Whitehawk Industries specialised in providing the best and only the best nuclear power structures, not only in the midwest, but the best the whole United States has ever had within its borders. After my old man retired and handed the company over to yours truly, I’ve been determined to not only upgrade nuclear power as we know it, but transport humanity itself into the year 3000. 



As we walked, we followed Ali through a set of double doors and found ourselves on a long metal platform and underneath it looked to be what I would assume to be a large pool, like the ones you get at gyms or waterparks but this was way deeper, well over twenty-five metres. Eventually, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to ask Jerry what it was for



“This is the cooling tower,"" Jerry said. He shifted and glanced over the barrier into the fluorescent blue water



“Every nuclear power plant has one, It’s where the reactor sits, right at the bottom, The water keeps the fuel rods at a reasonable temperature” 



“Why is it so blue?” I asked 



“Cherekov’s Radiation is what they call it, The glow of the reactor causes light to be emitted with large concentrations at a specific wavelength. When the rods come out of the reactor after several years they ain’t gonna stop pumping out that radiation, in fact, they ain’t gonna stop for another hundred years or so, that’s for sure. So we just put em in water to keep em at bay, Just got to hope the water cycle keeps changing otherwise that water is gonna boil and we don’t want any more accidents”



“Anymore?” I asked. “So there have been accidents here?”



Jerry bit his lip nervously



“Let’s just say we’ve had a few incidents over the years”



I looked at him. He already understood that I wanted him to elaborate



“Some poor bastard fell in once, when the water filter was broken. This whole pool was filled with nuclear waste, the folks here refer to it as the 97 incident” 



“Did the guy survive?” I asked sheepishly 



Jerry then gave me a look of anxiety that made me realise that whoever this bloke was, he didn’t get lucky in the end



“I wouldn’t worry about it too much fella” Jerry said as he tried his best at some form of reassurance. “Since then, our health and safety policy has come a long way. We have special procedures for when any of our team handles anything around the area. Plus, only qualified individuals are permitted to enter the platform.”



Well, that was good enough for me, I guess.



As the day went on, we were shown what our assignments would be. As an intern, my job would be on the first floor, operating the various types of machinery used to transport radioactive supplements. It wasn’t bad at first, the machines were fairly easy to get my head around, and the pay was more than generous. I became friendly with the other workers. I already knew Jason and it was nice to familiarise myself with my other peers. One of them I learned was named Marcus. He must’ve been in his mid 20s or so. He was a latino guy who’d been struggling to make ends meet over in California and had relocated to Whitehawk after being offered a job, I also learned that he wasn’t actually qualified to work in the states but Ali had taken a chance on him because quote “everyone deserves the opportunity to make something of themselves” He seemed nice enough though. A good laugh and fun to be around as well. Henry and Joanna Ashbrook were both pretty cool once I got to know them. Joanna was loud and feisty whilst Henry was quieter and softly spoken. We ended up becoming good friends, which I guess is what you need in a work environment like this. Another was a stocky, bald, middle-aged mustached bloke named Biff. Biff, who I recognised from the picket line, was the boss of the Whitehawk Company Union and an avid believer of worker’s rights. 



I first encountered Biff when the guys and I were slacking off in the staff lounge. We were having a contest of  how many butterfinger bites each of us could carry in our mouths at one time. Juvenile? Sure, but we were off shift and we were bored. The moment came when Henry spat a whole bite out so hard that it flew across the room and hit the far wall. We all lost our shit which is when I heard the voice from the hallway.



“Can you shitheads keep the noise down?” Biff stood in the doorway, a scowl plastered across his face. “I’m out there leading the picket lines every morning tryin to keep you and all the other schmucks here from dyin, maybe you could stop these games and lift your weight a lil bit” He turned and carried on down the hallway and out of sight.

“That’s Biff” Joanna said formally as she sat down and sipped a paper cup of coffee. “He’s nice, I promise”



“Eh, He’s alright” Henry said in response. 



After about a week, things seemed to be going okay. I spent my afternoons off shift wandering about the town and exploring the nooks and crannies of the place. Everything seemed more old school than back home, the stores didn’t use contactless payments, I had to carry cash around on me at all times and the endless sprawl of strip malls and houses seemed to be an almost cartoonishly stereotypical American daydream. Then things started to take a rocky turn, I found myself getting nauseous whilst on the factory floor, the vast amounts of overprocessed snacks from the local 7/11 probably didn’t help sure, but this was different, Even after a good night sleep and countless cups of coffee and energy drinks from the Vending machine, I still felt tired all the time, Almost nodding off on various occasions. I began to experience headaches, migraines, stomach pain and nausea. It got to the point where I felt I couldn’t function and needed a break. I needed to find Jason. I hadn’t seen him in a few days. Apparently he had voluntarily slept over at the plant these past few nights, a lot of workers in the industry do so as I’m told. To “keep everything in order at all costs”. 



As I entered the staff lounge, I saw Henry sitting on one of the couches with a pen and a sticky note enthusiastically scrawling something on it. When he saw me walk in, he looked up and stopped what he was doing. . He and I were the only ones in the room, I sat down across from him with my head in my palm



“You good man?” Henry asked

“Yeah, Well, no, I’m not actually sure. For the past couple of days, I’ve just been feeling sick all the time.



“Yeah, we get that a lot, It’s what happens when you work in a place like this. Being around this much radioactive material all day everyday gets to your insides”

 

“You mean I’m breathing in these toxic fumes and that’s what’s making me sick?” I asked



“You got that right” he answered 



“Well, can’t we wear masks or something to avoid things like this happening?”



Henry looked at the floor.



“We tried that multiple times, heck, that’s what Biff is here for, to make the demand for better working conditions but Ali made budget cuts to reduce company spending a while back and said all us worker folk needed to make sacrifices, whatever in hell that means”



I zoned out in disbelief. What kind of boss would do this to their own employees? Was he trying to kill all of us? How in the fuck was this even allowed in the first place? Maybe, it’s being a stuffy European and all but I’m pretty sure none of this would ever fly back home. Health and safety is all we ever talk about whereas here, it seemed to be seen as some kind of privilege.

  


Henry looked over at me and sighed. “Look, I ain’t gonna pretend that I know Ali too well, I only work for the guy but if you go to his office and explain the situation, He might just let you take the afternoon off, he’s understanding like that”



“Alright man, see you at home later I guess”



“Sure thing fella” Henry replied 



He patted me on the shoulder as I left the room and made my way to the elevator that would take me to the basement floor where Mr Whitehawk’s office was located. As I made my way to the elevator and pressed the button for the floor I wanted, I felt something stuck to my back, something loose and crumpled. As I reached back to feel what it was, I realised it was a small piece of paper or more specifically, a sticky note. It was the same one Henry had been writing on as I walked in the room. I plucked it from my back and held it in front of me. What it said made my blood run 

cold. Written hastily in biro pen were the words: LEAVE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD LEAVE, WHILST YOU’RE STILL ABLE TO WITH YOUR LIFE.

1kv40pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kv40pl/sp_be_the_power/,[SP] Be the Power,"He first noticed it waiting for coffee, leaning against the glass outside a gym. One of those antiseptic temples downtown, all chrome and white light, full of people spending ninety a month to run from nothing. Bodies in rows, moving in place. Climbing, sweating, pedaling. Burning hours, calories, all of it sealed behind mirrored walls.

All that effort. It was impossible not to see the waste. He watched a woman lean forward on her bike, sweat pooling at her brow, her knuckles white as she gripped the handlebars. A man two rows behind punched at a control panel, frustrated by a resistance setting. The instructors circled, clapping their hands. Someone raised a bottle in exhausted triumph. A cheer went up. Nothing changed.

He did the numbers in the corner of a coffee-stained napkin. Then in his notebook, then on a spreadsheet. One body, a hundred watts for an hour if they really tried. Multiply by a city block’s worth of these gyms, by a year’s worth of morning routines. Tens of thousands of hours, burned and forgotten. Enough to light a neighborhood, if it wasn’t all trapped behind glass.

He started to imagine the circuitry, the wiring, the old machines stripped down to their engines, every pedal and step and swing feeding into batteries stacked like gravestones. It would not fix the grid, but it would be a defiance against waste. Make effort mean something. He spent months sketching, scavenging parts, learning to rewire and invert, reworking his own design until the gym was stripped of everything except necessity. No mirrors, no TVs, no branding. Just machines, sweat, effort, the invisible current building up behind it all.

He called it The Dynamo Project. The only entry fee was work. You pedaled, you earned. If you put in enough, you collected credits, water, a meal, a subway pass. There was no slogan, no soft pitch. The word “empowerment” was thrown around because people needed something to say. It was a grid built on the premise that no one’s labor was wasted, and no sweat evaporated without purpose.

It spread. For a time, it was contagious. The environmentalists came first, then the influencers, each spinning their story. Journalists arrived with notebooks and cameras, trying to frame the place as an answer, or a threat, or a quirk of the city’s appetite for novelty. “*Be the Power*,” someone printed on a poster, then on a tote bag, then on a website. He watched as strangers photographed themselves with the bikes, as hashtags accumulated, as the Project became a digital cause.

Then came the backlash. Tweets and tags and commentary. ""*Labor disguised as wellness.*"" ""*Another scheme for the desperate*."" ""*No one should sweat for necessities*."" The kind of noise that never really wants an answer. It didn’t last long. Sponsors scattered. Permits died. The doors closed. Waste reasserted itself.

A week later, passing by that same glass gym, he paused. Full again. Bright as ever. The city’s professionals, still sweating, still running nowhere, still paying for the privilege of watching their own exhaustion reflected in endless mirrors. Nothing captured or given back. Just the iniquity of wasted effort. He stood there for a while, holding his coffee, staring through the glass.

He understood, finally, that this was the city’s true preference. Sweat is sanctified only when it serves nothing but the self. The moment energy is asked to move outside the mirror, something in people revolts. They call it exploitation to be useful. They demand their waste be private, their effort a closed circuit. It’s not the grid that is broken, but the contract of selfishness. He finished his coffee, left the gym behind, and walked home through a city more than willing to keep its lights on as long as no one is ever asked to share the cost.",1,1748183676.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

Our dad and her fiancé joined for the sport. Over the two days, I paid for our hotel room, and paid my own travel fare, as well as offered to cover my own match/seat tickets (sister declined, saying it was a gift). Enjoying myself, I didn't think much of her covering the modest amount of food we ate out--just coffee, diner chicken & cokes, nothing much or fancy. But then on the journey home, she blew up at me in a service station for for not paying or offering to pay for food for the group or for petrol on the return journey (we took the pricier train there, that I paid for). I got hissed at about it, in front of a rest stop crowd, then told to chase down my future BIL to hand him my debit card in front of everyone so he could pay for coffees, then got the silent treatment and a frosty hug from both on the way back. This ruined the mood and happiness of the event. I couldn't believe it, and have been in shock & horror for weeks about it, unable to even text my sister back because I'm so embarrassed and crushed that she'd humiliate and disrespect her older sister in public that way. Tbc I would have been more fine with her gently taking me aside in private, say to the bathroom or the car, if she really had to vent that in her eyes I'm such a cheap shameful leeching loser. It was the sudden, violent, punitive and exposing way she handled it that I object to. My sister doesn't usually act like this, we're usually friendly and open and forgiving of one another. Not to mention she's doing well (way better than me) financially and repeatedly insisted the weekend was a gift. I get that it's etiquette to offer to comp everything, but I did that a few times and was waved off. And I paid for the bulk of the expensive portions of the trip myself. Yet she felt justified in making me feel worthless in front of a crowd, our father (himself a bigger deadbeat than I could ever be) and my future brother. I'm so confused and don't know how to handle it, or who's more in the wrong between us. I acknowledge that out of politeness or care I could or should have been pushier about covering costs. But now I'm mad and sad about a weekend that should have been quality time or a nice memory. 
So: shall I quietly pay my sister back the fifty or so quid she spent, say sorry for the delay and the unawareness and making her feel used, then leave it at that? Shall I bring up my misgivings at all? Or shall I ask for an apology before/instead of compensating her? She's lightly harassing me via text/dm saying she knows something's up on my end, though she hasn't brought up the trip or the money since. She's an assertive bossy no-nonsense yet sensitive type, and I hate confrontation, so I have no idea what to say without her blowing up or taking it as a personal attack/evidence of me making 'everything all about me' (I don't, I just have boundaries and expect people to say/do what they mean).

1kv3thm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenOver40/comments/1kv3thm/probably_overthinking_this_relationship_with_my/,Probably overthinking this... relationship with my Mother.,"I'm 48. My Mother is 85. My Father passed away 3.5 years ago. I live about 20 minutes away from my Mother. She still lives in our childhood home. I love my parents more than anything in the world. My childhood home is my favorite place on earth. This is all the context. :)

For many years, I would go out to my Mom's house several mornings per week and have coffee, hang out, etc. I love it out there, both for being with her and for the place that it is. However, the past year or so, I've just not done that and I don't know why. I spend every Sunday out there but I don't go at all anymore throughout the week. My husband says I'm way overthinking this and that I have a home and things to do and she likes to get out of the house and things just change. I accept that things change. But, it feels sad to me and it feels like I should do what it takes to reestablish that routine. But, I always worry that if I go out there, she will have something else she wants to do instead (go to town, for example) and I'll squash that for her. She loves to be at home but she also loves to be on the go sometimes, too. 

And yet, I feel there's something to it all and it's nibbling at me. Is our relationship not the same for some reason? Am I subconsciously trying to wean myself off the house, a place that I love so much but will almost certainly have to part with at some point? I know that nothing I have to do here is as important as spending time with my Mother and we DO spend time together but not like we did when I went over there a couple of mornings per week (at least one morning outside of Sundays). I know it's all my doing but I feel very sad about it. 

For a bit more context, I'm pretty sure I'm well into the abyss of perimenopause so it's entirely possible that I'm making way more of this than it really is. ",1,1748183151.0,WomenOver40,2,1.0,False

The conversation on hinge was just about setting up the first date which was drinks friday night in her neighbourhood. She said she had tentative plans from 10pm onwards (which was probably a backup plan if she wasnt into it) so we met up at 6:30pm. The first date went really well we drank and talked for multiple hours and then got pizza - stayed out till midnight. A hug goodbye and parted ways. I texted her that I had a great time, and would love to see her again which she reciprocated.

We arrange the second date through text for the following Thursday night after work in my neighbourhood. Something to.point out is that we dont text each other often, just to plan the date and sometimes a full day or two between texts. Which I'm totally fine with in these early stages. She's only moved to the city about 3 months ago, she's busy with her life, I'm busy with my life, I don't expect to texting all the time before we're actually exclusively dating. Second date also goes great, we hang out and drink for multiple hours and have dinner together. I walk her back to the train station and we make out before she leaves. I tell her see you soon, which she replies with looking forward to it.

After the weekend I text her I have tickets to a late night club gig for Friday night and if she'd like to go since I knew she would be into the dj playing as well. We confirm on Tuesday that we're going and she says she's excited for it. We meet up on Friday night at 8:30pm, do some bar hopping and hang till midnight before going into the gig. We're having a good time dancing. After about 30mins I make the move and increase the intimacy by dancing closer to her and getting a little handsy-er which she doesn't back away from. From there we continue enjoying the music, and also make out multiple times. We leave the gig at around 3:30am and continue making out and chatting for a bit. I say to her ""I'd invite you back to mine but we're a little far away"", knowing that her place was 15 mins away. Which she responds with ""Wanna go back to mine for a drink?"". We get to hers at around 4am, where we both realise we dont need any more wine since it's already late so she makes me tea and we have it together on her couch. She then says ""It's getting late, should we go into my bedroom?"" which we do and start making out and getting handsy. I help her take off her pants and as things were getting a little more hot and heavy she says ""I'm sorry but the tiredness has just hit me and I dont think I can do this right now, just mentally, I'm so sorry"". I say ""That's totally okay, no need to be sorry at all, it is quite late"". I was unsure of how she was actually feeling because it was very sudden switch in moods. She then offered me a shirt to sleep in and even gave me a spare tooth brush which we then brushed our teeth and got ready for bed. I then slept over in her bed for the night - nothing else happened. She gets up at around 10am and I get up at around 10:30am to her in the living room doing some work that was due for her PHD that she had mentioned she had earlier to me. She offered to make coffee or go get coffee but I say to her ""Thank you so much, but I should let you get your work done so you can enjoy the rest of the weekend"" - I got the feeling she was more offering out of politeness which I could be wrong about, but I had things to get done that day as well. So I freshen up, we hug, kiss on the cheek, say we had a great time at the gig, and I leave, with no mention of what happened. I've texted her since then saying I had lots of fun with her and asked if she finished her submission but haven't received a reply back (its been a full 24hrs).

I'm just confused whether the sudden change in mood was just tiredness, or did she have a last minute change of feelings as there wasnt much reassurance that's she's still into me. I guess only time will tell when she finally replies (or doesnt reply). Could she be feeling awkward about the fact she stopped mid way? Should I text her anything about it? Do I leave it with what I've texted already and just see what happens?

There's a photograph on the mantel, a snapshot of laughter frozen in time. She runs her fingers over the frame, a ritual of remembrance. The image smiles back, holding stories in its gaze, tales that these walls once whispered.

Outside, the world moves in rhythm, but here, in this cocoon of familiar scents and shadows, life drifts gently. The heartbeats of yesterdays flutter in synchrony with her own, weaving grief into the fabric of the everyday.

In the garden, the roses bloom defiantly against the chill. Petals dance with the whispers of the wind, echoing lessons learned from both presence and absence. The hands of time caress the earth, planting seeds of both sorrow and growth, crafting a canvas where she paints the shades of longing.

She pauses, breathes deeply, and lets the silence speak. It tells of voids and comforts, of a love enduring in the spaces between heartbeats. It's in these quiet moments that the echoes find their voice, singing softly of a grief that doesn't fade but transforms, finding its rhythm entwined with daily life.

I’m going through a really tough time right now and don’t really have anyone to talk to. I have no friends and no social life. At the moment I struggle to find any meaning or purpose in just existing. I don’t like going outside, especially in the afternoon, because I feel anxious around people.

My daily routine mostly looks like this: I drink coffee in the morning, tidy up a little and then I already look forward to when it gets dark so I can take my sleeping pills and try to sleep.

I often wish I had someone to hang out with or do something with, but then I convince myself it wouldn’t make a difference because I don’t find any meaning in those things.

Lately, I’ve been avoiding talking to or meeting people because I’m really insecure about how I look—I think I look weird or even disfigured. I have zero self-confidence. I’m always watching myself at home and outside, trying not to act “weird.”

1kv3j3f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kv3j3f,So I watched fixing RWBY series by Celtic Phoenix,"I saw people talking about fixing rwby series, and I honestly? I thought, why not let me give this a try. and I managed to binge the entire thing in less than a week.

this is just a quick ramble of my thoughts, so don't expect a deep dive/criticism or ways I could improve the series, it's already leagues better than og RWBY series imo.

  
firstly, and I have to get this out of the way, I think replacing Oscar with Roman/Neo was probably one of the best decisions in the series. really, I couldn't help but get a little excited once he joined the main cast, instead of Ozpin taking hold of Oscar, he took over Roman's...a very creative choice and Roman was a rather entertaining character and I found myself giggling in the scenes he appeared.

Character interactions are handled rather well, much better than in actual RWBY, Ruby actually gets scene's with Blake, Yang's PTSD is actually really well handled and isn't one episode typa shtick. and honestly? I think I've heard that majority of the criticism this rewrite is that, things end up pretty much the same, nothing really deviates too much and I'm honestly okay with that? would be weird to watch a series where it deviates from the original story so much, really even older characters don't get forgotten about and still are relevant. really, I can't say much that hasn't already been said about this rewrite, but I do wanna tackle my favorite character in the series.  
\----  
You saw my flair, you know I had to talk about my **GOAT**.

Adam - let me just preface this, that he is a MASSIVE improvement from the original series, he isn't a crazy ex stalker, but a rather big extremist, I love how vergil's theme constantly follows him when he appears, and honestly? his red coat is a great design, not just that...but he is pretty much incredibly OP in the series.

he slices down a massive building. he had the balls to jump onto the train, in what he probably knew would've been filled with like at least 15 Huntsman, took on team *CFVY* and *CRDL*  by himself in earlier volumes, took on Cardin, Russle AND Qrow while he was actively winning the fight, and the entire team RWBY had to resort to running away because they knew they couldn't deal with him.

there's probably more awesome stuff he's done that I'm not remembering due to this review being completely written off the top of my head, but overall, if my life was on the line and they said you have to choose two people (not counting the other maidens themselves) to save you from a Maiden like Cinder or something. my first choice would be Adam with how powerful he was made out to be, and the second would be Hazel himself.

now, I do still have complaints about him still, I wouldn't say this Adam was absolutely perfect, in the end I did feel like he was a bit of mustache twirling villain, he had depth but often times I found his goals to be nonsensical and rather hypocritical, I much rather would've preferred Adam be taken in the direction of the anti hero. considering how many redemption fanfics I've read of him, this might be my bias leaking in, I'm well aware if Celtic mostly wants to keep the storyline the same, he won't and doesn't have to appeal to my fanatism for Adam, but all I'm saying he did leave a rather bad taste in my mouth.

example being, he claims humans only ever hurt the faunus, yet his actions directly hurt the Faunus and the white fang...why did he listen to cinder? why didn't he try to disobey? he says humans hurt the faunus yet during the attack on beacon, he very much planned on killing Velvet and Fox despite them being Faunus like him.

I think this is probably done on purpose right? I believe Blake even states ""it was never about the faunus, it was about you"" implying Adam perhaps never cared for the cause...he just simply wanted to violently lash out and kill humans. which is why I'm so annoyed every time this depiction of Adam comes up, he CAN be a violent extremist but can't there be room for him to actually care about the cause? be logical in his world viewing instead of spite and hatred clouding his judgement? he never listens, I much prefer a depiction if Adam could be written more like Magneto, extremist nonetheless but you would never see him actively go out of his way to harm his mutant bretheren even if they aren't allied with his cause like we saw with Adam.

the final fight? awesome, great culmination of Yang getting over her PTSD and her delivering the final blow which mirrored Adam's moonslice affect, but instead everything went yellow and in flames. nice touch. the way he went out? awesome, even if his principles was something I feel like are illogical, he stuck to them to the very end, threw out one last ""fuck you schnee"" and died fighting.

that being said...I don't think he SHOULD'VE went out at all, and I don't mean by story perspective of me wanting him to be around till the end (even though personally I do yes.) I mean by more of a logical perspective, at the end team rwby somewhat did get the upper hand, but that was quickly trounced once Adam finally figured out their plan and caught Ruby and held her up by her throat...really nothing was stopping him from just stabbing her, right then and there, instead? he threw her up in the air and turned his back on the 3 other members of team rwby to try and kill Ruby with a moonslice.

which opened him up to Yang delivering that final blow with the help of Weiss. instead of...ya know, logically just stabbing Ruby and than taking on rest of team WBY with less difficulty now that he got rid of their team leader. I think Celtic made the same mistake the team CRWBY did, they made Adam too strong and later on his subsequent defeat makes rather no sense imo.

  
but enough about that, did I enjoy this Adam much more than the canon one? yes. is he much better written than his canon counterpart? yes. do I think he should've been changed? no. again I would simply personally prefer him being more of a quality character with a noble goal/anti hero route considering my absolute bias for that man, he still served his role in the story quite well and got the respect he deserved. he was badass, unhinged but a part of me just wished he saw reason, that's all, I'd love to know what you guys feel about this rewrite and about Adam in there.",6,1748182404.0,RWBYcritics,2,0.87,False
