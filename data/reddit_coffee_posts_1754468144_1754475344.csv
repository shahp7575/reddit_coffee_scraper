My family has inherited grandma's legendary formal lounge and dining suite - in a dark teal blue velvet and jarrah. Two settees, two armchairs, dining chairs, table and coffee tables all matching. Big yikes in my interior design brain but parents would like to incorporate into their formal lounge and formal dining. 

To avoid just having it all matching and looking like something from country Australia in the 80s, I have been playing with layout and decor for the lounge. No painting or purchasing of items is likely, so just using what we have. The photos are where I got to in terms of layout, and now I'm stumped! Any decor on the mantle looks crazy busy and hectic. What am I getting wrong? I'm thinking the bird paintings stacked on the left side? 

There's a whole house of furniture and decor and art I can pull from so suggest away and I'll try my best! The home was previously designed with lots of matching marri wood pieces, grey pleather and silver (think corporate boardroom). I've slowly been redesigning and bringing in more of our families preferred aesthetics and phasing out the corporate chic. Most of my finished spaces are a mix of rustic, farmhouse and coastal hampdens. Lots of corals and shells, teal blue and sandy whites with raw gnarled wood and rustic wrought iron. Somehow I made this work elsewhere, but these couches are throwing me.

1mj0hio,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_offpageyugtechnology/comments/1mj0hio/how_dental_veneers_can_transform_your_smile/,How Dental Veneers Can Transform Your Smile,"A beautiful smile can boost your confidence, enhance your appearance, and make a lasting first impression. But what if your teeth are chipped, discolored, or unevenly spaced? That‚Äôs where **dental veneers** come in. These thin, custom-made shells are one of the most popular cosmetic dentistry solutions available today, offering a quick yet dramatic improvement in your smile.

# What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers are wafer-thin shells made of porcelain or composite resin that are bonded to the front surface of your teeth. They are designed to mimic the natural look of tooth enamel and can correct a variety of dental imperfections.

# Common Issues Veneers Can Fix:

* Stained or discolored teeth
* Chipped or broken teeth
* Uneven or worn-down teeth
* Gaps between teeth
* Slight misalignment or irregular shapes

Porcelain veneers are highly resistant to stains and last longer, while composite veneers are more affordable and can often be applied in a single visit.

# The Process of Getting Veneers

The veneer process is generally painless and completed in just a few visits. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

# 1. Consultation

Your journey begins with a detailed evaluation at a reputed [**Dental Clinic in Udaipur**](https://drmahima.in/). The dentist will examine your teeth, understand your goals, and decide if veneers are the right option for you.

# 2. Tooth Preparation

A small amount of enamel is shaved from the front surface of your teeth to make space for the veneer. This ensures a natural and seamless fit.

# 3. Impression and Design

An impression of your teeth is taken and sent to a dental lab, where your custom veneers are crafted. Meanwhile, temporary veneers may be placed.

# 4. Bonding

Once your permanent veneers are ready, your dentist will check the fit, shape, and color before bonding them with a strong dental adhesive. A special light is used to harden the adhesive for long-lasting results.

# Benefits of Dental Veneers

# Instant Smile Transformation

One of the most appealing features of veneers is how quickly they deliver results. Within just a few appointments, you can have a complete smile makeover.

# Natural Look and Feel

Veneers are custom-designed to match your natural teeth in color, shape, and size, making them almost indistinguishable from real teeth.

# Durable and Long-Lasting

Porcelain veneers can last 10 to 15 years or longer with proper care, offering great value for a long-term solution.

# Stain Resistance

Porcelain is highly resistant to stains from coffee, tea, wine, or smoking‚Äîunlike natural teeth, which can discolor over time.

# Minimal Maintenance

Caring for veneers is easy. Just brush and floss daily and maintain regular dental checkups.

# Are Veneers Right for You?

Veneers are ideal for individuals with generally healthy teeth who want to improve the aesthetics of their smile. They are **not** recommended for:

* People with severe tooth decay
* Patients with gum disease
* Individuals who grind or clench their teeth excessively (unless wearing a night guard)

During a visit to a trusted **Dental Clinic in Udaipur**, your dentist will assess whether veneers are suitable based on your dental health and aesthetic goals.

# Post-Treatment Care Tips

* Avoid chewing on hard objects like ice or pens.
* Wear a mouthguard if you grind your teeth at night.
* Avoid food and drinks that cause staining.
* Maintain good oral hygiene and visit your dentist regularly.

# Veneers vs Other Cosmetic Treatments

Wondering how veneers compare to other cosmetic options?

|Treatment|Ideal For|Longevity|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Veneers|Aesthetic flaws, moderate spacing|10‚Äì15 years|
|Teeth Whitening|Stains and discoloration|6 months‚Äì2 years|
|Dental Bonding|Minor chips and gaps|3‚Äì10 years|
|Braces/Invisalign|Alignment issues|Permanent with retention|

Veneers offer a more **comprehensive solution** if you want a smile that looks perfect in both form and color.

# Final Thoughts

Dental veneers are a game-changer for anyone looking to enhance their smile quickly and effectively. Whether it‚Äôs one tooth or your entire smile that needs improvement, veneers offer a blend of durability, natural aesthetics, and confidence-boosting transformation.

Starting mein like acha hi tha tho first day he kept asking for nudes rat mein. Toh pehle 2 haftein i just ignored cause mera exams chal raha tha and i just wanted to talk to someone (pura introvert hun) so after getting into a relationship and asking i sent him kyuki i did love him at the end (your girl is 100 percent chutiya) . After that he kept asking everyday it‚Äôs like he love bombed me so much pehle aur mere vents ko bhi sunta tha. Then after 2-3 months to him all he wanted was that. Problem ye tha i was groomed when i was 15 and had made bad choices where I didn‚Äôt want a guy to break up so I ended up sleeping with him once.
Toh maine bataya tha ki iss topic mein thoda kuch trauma hai still. Toh one day he kept pushing ki usko bhi apna vcard lose karna hai
Toh i told him let‚Äôs wait but he kept saying sab kar rhe hai kuch nhi hoga he won‚Äôt leave wagera wagera. Toh these few months usne sexual favours mangte raha problem is he never used protection. I even brought it but last mein pata chala ki usne lagake bich mein feik diya aur jo karna tha karke mujhe apne ap pill se handle krlo bolte rhta tha. Ok now towards the present we were having fights kyuki he kept forcing me to do it with him and his friends and he said ki already sab kuch huwa hi toh hai what‚Äôs the problem this guy litreally just saw me as a free sex worker. Toh maine mera ex ko text kiya ki aisa aisa ho raha hai and pehle bhi mera ex ne uske sath help kiya getting me that dabai because my bf (now ex) ‚Äúcouldnt ‚Äú toh i just vented and then guilt k bad I told my bf this happened twice. He told me trauma ho. Gaya uska aur sab dost ko bola ki I cheated? Bro. Ik it‚Äôs wrong but it‚Äôs micro cheating pata hai. So he told everyone ki main acha ghar se nhi hu wagera wagera. I forgot to mention mummy doctor hai so one time we had a fight and he tried killing himself toh uss time i asked my mom to look after him kyu ki rat ko kaun ayega? Plus uska typhoid mein bhi my mom took care of him clinic mein. So all this time dar lagta tha koi fight hua toh he‚Äôd do again. I was wrong it was just a manipulation tactic. Toh his vacations started and he kept coming outside my pg Milne k liye and would use my money for cab fare and food n all
He was asking my mom for money too
(THIS GUY LITREALLY SCAMMED BOTH OF US WITHOUT REALISING)
After me talking to my ex his favours got worse and worse 
This guy then went back to college
And stopped giving me time
Said now he has to be serious but story mein o kept seeing him roaming around
Which is funny because he wouldn‚Äôt even let me sleep before which caused me missing so many classes.
Toh we had a fight time k upar and we broke up
Big update he told everyone ki i apparently cheated aur uske bad that i ruined his life?
Mind you iss bar bhi dabai diya nhi and i cant buy it either cause of the age thing
Usne bola break up k baad Jo hona hai karke ao abortion ka pills mil jayega and that he will send half of the money for the pill
Like i did Everything just for him
And now after all the guilttripping he broke up said not worth it
And last mein i called him thinking maybe sorry bolke he will stop getting angry
NOOOOOO this guy literally found a girl now
Now hamara always caste ka issue tha and his parents didn‚Äôt accept 
Funny thing this girl wahi caste ki hai which is so backward cause 2025 mein caste ka baat kaise ho raha hai
And this girl k saath uska coffee date bhi hai aj usne story bhi lagwaya tha mind you it‚Äôs been 4 days since the breakup
He didn‚Äôt even allow me to go market kyuki he thought I‚Äôd go just to meet my ex
He would spam and check my phone
Always had my location
Yet always asked my friends If I was really with them or not
Bhai mujhe gali bhi diya tha when i told i didnt want to do all of that anymore

What I‚Äôm mainly wondering: is a weird, kinda fermented smell, normal? Is it the variety, or processing method that really does this. And if I wait longer does this smell go away or is it something people actually enjoy.

I‚Äôm at a loss married middle-aged ‚Äúgay‚Äù man. Quotes because I don‚Äôt feel drawn to the sexual actions my partner is into like crusing scenes or leather bars, or whatever he does. People say he takes advantage of my kindness, but I feel if I can make someone else better and devote or sacrifice it will be worth it, knowing full well this way of life isn‚Äôt a transactional relationship, maybe deep down I feel if I give more that there is more reward, delusional I know. Gay doesn‚Äôt really feel like I belong, Gray Sexual, like wtf? Also every conversation I have with a male is immediately my girlfriend and I, like I don‚Äôt care i‚Äôm not hitting on you! 

I love people and I feel like I have much love to give, my heart aches, but it isn‚Äôt sexual, I want friends but I fall in love with people too quickly, that it is easier to be alone, at age 40 people look at you differently, coworkers expect professionalism, and I take my work seriously and Im the ‚Äúbreadwinner‚Äù and I feel all the pressure is on me to succeed. 

I‚Äôm exhausted, lonely probably adhd or on the spectrum, at one time I had 4 different therapist at a time, not a joke. (primary, specialist, group, and infusions, psychiatry) i‚Äôve quit all. 

My mother calls me gullible, an old soul, I tend to relate to older people, always hold the door, always put other needs before myself.

I‚Äôm a fraternal twin but haven‚Äôt talk to them in years drifting slowly away 20 years ago, therapy helped with that. Live in a major city, but feel so isolated, i spent time playing video games, I have difficulty with attention  reading comprehension but not dumb by any means.

AI doesn‚Äôt help or scratch the itch, i‚Äôve burned out twice this year.  I always try to have a project which is never finishes, a life time of unfinished ideas and concepts. 

I love interesting people, The Man Whose Mind Exploded, and Poppa Neutrino, Wretches & Jabberers, and Brazil are my favorite films. 

But here I am alone, not really lonely, at times sure, but it passes.

I haven't changed anything in my technique at all, but I had gone away from home for a couple of weeks and when I got back, something changed.

Hello I am A .It all started when my dad took up a job in Hyderabad. I was staying in Mumbai for the past 5 years. I was pretty bummed about the move but I could not do anything so I was ready to start from scratch. I was in my 10th Grade and the society I shifted to was celebrating Ganesh Chaturthi, I use to attend the aarti every evening. On the 5th day there was couple of competition. I went at the time of aarti as I did not want to see any performance but when I reached there one single performance was going on. I decided I will come back after 10 min but then I saw her (Lets call her V). She was wearing a beautiful blue dress with a golden dupatta, she had her hair tied in braids and had kajal on her eyes. I am not the kind of person who believes in love at first sight, so I found her after her performance and we exchanged Insta ID. After that day we would talk everyday and I got to know her as a person and everyday I was falling in love with her even more but I did not have the courage to ask her out. I am not the most handsome looking guy, hell I am not even average looking and she was the most beautiful girl I saw so I did the next best thing, I told my best friend. 10 months passed and my birthday was coming up and my friend thought it was a good idea to tell V that I liked her on my birthday. I did not even know about it and then I saw V walking towards me and my friend waving his arm behind her. She asked me point black on my face ""A do you like me"" and I almost not able to speak told her ""YES I do"". She went back home and I very sad and went back home too. The next day I was standing at my society gate to catch the school bus. V & I use to go to the same school. I got on the bus and sat on an empty seat. It was a two person seat so I sat towards the windows and kept my bag on the other seat. V got on the bus and stood next to me and asked me to pick my bag. I picked the bag up. I was confused as there were other seats empty so why would she come and sit here and that's when she said it ""I like you too A"". To say I was happy would be an understatement. I somehow went through the school day. I reached home and since she was my first girlfriend I looked up on google what to do (Not a very good choice). Anyway I talked to her constantly. V had very open minded parents and she introduced me to her parents as her boyfriend and they were actually happy for her on the other hand my parents are very strict and would not allow any relationship or so I thought. One Sunday me and V decided to go to the movies, we saw the movie had some food and unfortunately my neighbor saw me drinking coffee with her and he told the same to my mother. I came back home and my parents confronted me and I told them I had a girlfriend and they told me there are okay with it as long as I score good marks in my boards. Everything was perfect and it was Ganesh Chaturthi again and this time I was there for her every performance. She won the prize for singing, dancing and drawing. I won the prize for badminton and TT. We both got busy with our studies after that and we had our exam finished just before Navaratri. Our society was having a garba night and neither me nor her had any idea how to do garba. I bought a new blue kurta and she was wearing a beautiful red suit. I loved seeing her in traditional outfits, she was looking stunning. I had no idea how to dance and at around 11:00 I told her I am going home as I am getting boarded. I got into the lift and she followed me. The lift stopped on the 3rd floor and she pulled me out of the lift before I could react the lift door closed. She pulled my hand and took me to her house. She opened the door as both her parents were still downstairs. I turned on the lights of the room and as soon as that door closed she kissed me on the cheek. I got so nervous I got an high heart beat alert on my watch. She could not stop laughing looking at my red blush cheeks and the alert on my watch. I don't know what gave me the confidence and I pulled her from the waist and kissed her on the lips. It was just magic. It was the first kiss for both of us. When we were done both of us were blushing and both of us could not stop laughing. We slow danced for like another 15 min and then I decided to go home. I cheeks were so red I had to wait for 10 minutes outside my house for them to get normal. Then we had our pre boards coming up and we got pretty busy. We started playing badminton for 1hr everyday and before I knew it was our Board Exam. I bought a full exam kit and gifted her. She gifted me a pen and a ruler. We both use to go the center together doing revision on the way and came back discussing the papers. On the day of our last exam I went to celebrate with my friends and she went with hers. I came home and we played badminton. After 2-3 months our result came and she was the first in our school with 97.5% and I was fifth with 92.3%. I was very happy and decided that we should go somewhere out. When I came home my dad told me that we were shifting from Hyderabad to some other city. I cried so hard. I told her the next day and she was very sad too, but there was nothing me or her could do in that situation. After 2 weeks I was standing there at the society gate and she kissed me and I came to Ahmedabad. Initially the long distance was going good but then we got busy. Video calls turned into calls, Calls turned to text. It had been almost 1.5years and we completed our 12th grade and I joined a College. The first week of college I woke up with a message at 3am ""A I don't think its working out between us. I don't have feelings for you and we should break up"". I gave this relationship my 101%. I called her, texted her, sent gifts to her on her birthdays, but I could not create feeling for me in her heart so we broke up and now I am lonely in my college, I am not able to make friends and every time there is a ping on my phone I hope its her.",1,1754473004.0,TeenIndia,3,0.67,False
1mj05jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1mj05jj/i_dont_look_great_so_far_no_face_gains_really/,I don't look 'great' so far - no face gains really,"Hi fellow Keto-ers. 

So far, I've lost a decent amount of weight in the first three weeks or so, just over 10 pounds. 

But face-wise, I look a bit tired and puffy if I'm honest. 

My sleep hasn't been great and I do suffer from apnea which I'm trying to reverse through weight loss. I have a lot of issues around sleep actually - staring at screens, late bedtimes - so I do believe sleep is something I really need to work on and that is probably a key factor. 

I guess I have stored all my fat in my belly so already had a relatively slim face but I just look more tired and haggard then before. 

To that end I was actually thinking of cutting coffee for a while and just drinking green tea. I wonder if anyone has tried that?

it seems coffee is held in very high regard in this forum but just wondering whether others have felt better cutting it out. According to Dr Berg, stress creates excess melanin which makes bags worse - so I was thinking that perhaps by going down the green tea route that I can start to reduce stress and cortisol release on a daily basis. 

I'm trying to get better with electrolyte supplementation. My diet has been on point otherwise. 

But yeah - overall I feel motivated but I'm a little dismayed about my face so far. 

I should also note I have decided to cut alcohol, so obviously I guess these positive changes will take some time to filter through?

How long was it for you when you started looking better? Do I need to just stick it out?",2,1754473003.0,keto,1,1.0,False
1mj05iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/interiordecorating/comments/1mj05iw/help_me_decorate_my_boring_all_white_apartment/,Help me decorate my boring all white apartment,"I'm in the process of decorating my apartment, but I have no idea how to go about it. I want to go for a mid century modern / eclectic/boho vibe with moody deep natural colours. But the problem is everything in my apartment is white (furniture, floors, walls, cabinets), so I dont know to get the vibe I want.

All the furniture came with the apartment, but right now we can only afford to replace the coffee table and rug, add a lounge chair and buy art and decor. I've already bought a small mcm wood table/shelf to go where the metal shelf is, and a vertical wine rack for the wall to go behind it

Because its a rental we can't change the wall colour, but I'm considering covering the kitchen table, floating shelves and kitchen cabinets in wood contact paper (I'm a bit nervous it will damage the cabinets?). The kitchen backsplash is peel and stick but I plan to replace it with something in our colour palette or just remove it completely (its white marble underneath)

How would you recommend I achieve my desired style? I think a new rug will make a big difference but I'm nervous about what colour to pick since it will really stand out on the white floors. My partner doesn't like Persian style rugs (sigh) but we're thinking maybe a shaggy Moroccan beni ourian rug, or a solid coloured rug in the palette. Any advice would be appreciated :)

1mj04z4,https://www.reddit.com/r/acecombat/comments/1mj04z4/documentary_series_episode_1_the_oadf/,Documentary series Episode 1: The OADF Post-Lighthouse War,"**A comedic take on the collapse of the OADF post lighthouse war.**

By the end of 2019‚Ä¶ life was but a dream for the Osean Air Force.

They‚Äôd absolutely dominated Erusea, flattening them like a boot on a poorly made pastry. They had the best planes. The best tech. The best pilot, Trigger, who flew an F-22 so advanced it made other jets look like children‚Äôs toys built from tin and shame.

Lockheed Martin, the clever people behind that magnificent machine, were churning out beasts with wings. And all of this? All of it was under the new Osean Air Command, a bunch of smartly dressed strategists who somehow turned Strider Squadron from a flaming pile of horse manure into the most successful outfit Osea had ever seen.

It was, without a doubt, the best of times for the people in Oured. The skies were theirs. The future was theirs.

And then‚Ä¶ well. Things took a turn.

Lockheed Martin, apparently bored of success, left the F-22 program entirely for another business venture in Erusea, because apparently, the future of air power lies in awkward business partnerships with your former enemy.

Meanwhile, Osean Air Command got the boot after months of speculation, PR disasters, and one particularly spectacular episode involving their enthusiastic defence of Trigger‚Äôs imprisonment in the 444th. A move that, in hindsight, was about as well thought out as strapping a piano to a glider.

Oh, and Trigger? The golden boy of the skies?

Well, he might be jumping ship to the mortal enemy. Because of course he is.

So now, between the internal power struggles, a revolving door of personnel, and looming regional chaos that could derail the whole thing.

So now, that dream of theirs has descended into a nightmare.

Does that sound like a stretch?

Well‚Ä¶ maybe not.

As they say, those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. And right now, it appears that in Oured, things are starting to come full circle.

Back in 2016 yes, more history stuff, McDonnell Douglas and Northrup Grumman were looking to offload a big share of their defence contract. They‚Äôd grown impatient with the fact there hadn‚Äôt been a war since the Circum-Pacific six years earlier. Like a bored pub brawler waiting for someone to spill his pint. And impatient with the Osean military who wanted to cut funding

They found a new bedfellow in Lockheed Martin, who agreed to a 50/50 deal for the contract. Everything was set in stone. Everything was ready to go. But then, the head honchos at McDonnell Douglas, in their infinite wisdom, decided: ‚ÄúNah. Let‚Äôs just bin the whole thing.‚Äù

And they offered Lockheed the contract outright, at a discount. Lockheed said, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

But after some very reluctant back-and-forth, and a fair bit of coaxing from the newly-formed Osean Air Command, who were very keen to get exclusive access to the F-22 and its secrets, they agreed. Barely. At the 11th hour.

So the wheels began to turn.

Lockheed rolled into their new digs in Oured, still covered in McDonnell Douglas and Grumman paint, took one look around and went; ‚ÄúWhat the hell were these guys doing?‚Äù Morale was flat. Direction was non-existent. Motivation? Forget it.

So, naturally, they sacked the entire leadership, with their morning coffee still steaming on the desk, and brought in a new showrunner: General Padbury.

The first few years were tentative, but Padbury had a plan. He kept everyone who shared his vision of turning the OADF into the most dominant air force in the world. Anyone who was just there to punch in, collect a cheque, and go home at five? Vamus.

After convincing the Osean government that Lockheed‚Äôs astronomically high salary was ‚Äúworth it,‚Äù Osean Air Command got to work, and Lockheed didn‚Äôt take long to leave their mark.

By 2017, the OADF was making big strides.

By 2018, the F-22 was fully integrated into the grid.

And by 2019, at the end of the Lighthouse War, they were the best at, well‚Ä¶ everything.

After years of muddling about in a fog of mediocrity during the interwar and early war periods, they had finally reached the promised land. And it wasn‚Äôt just because of Lockheed‚Äôs pencil magic or Trigger‚Äôs ability to rewrite the laws of physics. It was the whole operation. The command, the coordination, the chemistry.

Life was good.

‚Ä¶But then they hit a lull.

Grunder Industries was still lightyears ahead with their drone tech, selling to the likes of Free Erusea and Yuktobania. And new Erusean allies were being... well... Erusean. And despite technically being part of the same team, Osean Air Command didn‚Äôt see much help from the OADF. The official stance? ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll bridge the tech gap with willpower and the power of friendship... with our new Erusean friends...‚Äù

...Right.

Osean Air Command disagreed. Very publicly. And the fallout damaged their relationship beyond repair.

Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin, tired of jets and probably craving something involving yoga and recycled wood, wanted to design floating skateparks instead.

Padbury was starting to lose control of the situation. But somehow, he convinced Lockheed to stay. And from 2020 onwards, Erusea was officially brought into the program.

Skepticism was rife, given how gloriously they botched the Lighthouse War. But surprisingly‚Ä¶ it worked. Erusea‚Äôs problem had always been a refusal to accommodate. But the new Erusean government, however, opened its arms wide and that was one piece of the puzzle solved.

Now onto Trigger.

He entered the scene in 2018 after only a year of flight school. That was all he needed. His performance in those trainer jets was so ridiculous he was shooting down F-16s and F-15s in training missions piloting something that would‚Äôve struggled to chase a lawnmower.

He had moves.  
He had aura.  
He had immediate star power.

So they promoted him. Straight to the OADF.

In 2019, he was rushed into the Lighthouse War after their last rookie was shipped off to the gulag for trying to land upside down. Trigger‚Äôs debut? Ace on day one. eight bombers downed over Fort Grays. Not bad.

Sure, there was a patch where he punted anything that moved and crashed into anything that didn‚Äôt. But even so, he was made leader of Strider Squadron halfway not even six months in.

And by 2020, he‚Äôd hit his stride.

It wasn‚Äôt easy. There were controversial moments‚Ä¶ hello, 444th‚Ä¶ but anyone who thought this was a one-off fluke was dead wrong.

By 2022, Strider Squadron was a weapon.

Erusean remnants were eradicated, while Yuktobania fell victim to its own Yukeness.

Life was still a dream.

So why am I telling you all this?

Because we have to understand what was built. How much was achieved, and how short the time frame really was.

It wasn‚Äôt just Padbury‚Äôs leadership.

Or Lockheed‚Äôs aircraft wizardry.

Or Trigger‚Äôs uncanny skill.

It was everyone. The entire machine running smoothly.

And Lockheed Martin?

They were Papa Smurf. The wise one. The peacemaker.

Whenever someone was throwing a tantrum in the hangar or someone else wanted to duel over kill scores, Lockheed would roll in, calm everyone down, and keep things together.

This was a team, and no one was bigger than the team.

But this, right here, is where the first cracks started to appear.

General Padbury had been a fixture since 2016. Strategist. Visionary. Influential. Even in the new drone era. But by 2023, he decided to step down for a higher position.

The OADF had lost a decent fish.

Not to worry though, things seemed fine. The F-22 was still so dominant it was a miracle they lost one at all. By the time the F-22S arrived in 2023, everything was looking peachy.

But‚Ä¶ this was the year when things started to take a really, really wrong turn.

Reports emerged that Osean Air Command was being investigated for corruption tied to Trigger‚Äôs imprisonment. Any hope that this would stay quiet was extinguished, once the news broke to the public. The upshot is that despite multiple statements filled with soft rhetoric and easy words and fluffy pillows, they still defended their actions which led to Trigger's imprisonment to the 444th.

Understandably, a large portion of the public was upset and it was beginning to become a major problem for the OADF. McDonnell Douglas, who were just about to hop back into bed with them, demanded answers, and lamented the lack of transparency it had.

Yes, yes, legal malarkey meant cards had to be kept close to the chest but with all the hullabaloo around this ordeal, the more damning the whole thing was becoming.

23 days after the first reports, the OADF announced the case would be dismissed. That seemed to be that.

Until the very next day an anonymous source emailed the OBC with damning evidence that suggested Osean Air Command knew Trigger was innocent. And to make matters worse, onboard camera footage from Trigger's F-16 taken during the botched rescue of Harling was released, showing that Trigger was not the one to fire the missile that downed the former president. It was clear as day that Air Command had access to this footage, but proceeded to convict him anyway.

The commotion was now impossible to contain. Meetings were held as to what was going on, and what was going to be done about it. Panic was setting in, people were suspended, and Air Commands position became untenable.

It seemed that every few days, the water got murkier, and it was starting to affect morale within the force.

In Three Strikes: The Inside Story of the OADF, author Long Caster described the day the emails leaked. He described a tense mood. Nervousness. An eerie sense that something was about to happen.

The thing is, that was actually before the leak. Which implied that people there already knew more than what they were letting on.

And then the first big domino... fell.

In late 2023, it was reported that Lockheed Martin, the company responsible for creating the most dominant plane the world had ever seen, was leaving the OADF to seek further opportunities in the              X-02S program. Official announcement came later. Osea had just lost a major asset. And reports linked the departure directly to Trigger‚Äôs imprisonment saga.

That same month? Head of strategy and the main AWACS Long Caster also left.

While all this was going on, the competitiveness of the OADF was in freefall. They went from fielding an unbeatable jet last year‚Ä¶ to struggling to score kills unless Trigger was flying.

Trigger himself? Being courted by a certain Erusean Chancellor in Farbanti. Desperate for a new boo after Mihaly caved to the sweet siren call of old age.

People were leaving Osea left, right, and center. The plane was getting worse. And the Erusean Chancellor? In Trigger‚Äôs ear like: ‚ÄúYou are the future.‚Äù

This dream of theirs? Was descending into a nightmare

For a while, things went quiet again. Trigger hit his 400th kill. Focus shifted to 2024. And for many, last year‚Äôs mess was forgotten.

But not by everyone. Trigger's squadron was still out for blood and the F-22 couldn't match what everyone else was fielding as the technological gap closed further.

Erusea's persistence was paying off. Trigger was thinking real hard about a move to Farbanti. And the Erusean Royal Air Force (ERAF) was ready to sell their Kidneys and children to get him on board, regardless of what happened in the past.

The OADF at this point was a far cry from what it was just a few years ago. Only Trigger could get results in the F-22, hell, he was the only one able to score kills in this thing. The fact that he could still take out drones proved just how badly they needed him, and how much they could not afford to lose him.

It‚Äôs often said that later upgraded models of the F-22 were built around Trigger. Even if that‚Äôs true, he constantly bitches and moans about the handling. And we‚Äôve seen, on multiple occasions, that it handles like a truck compared to rivals. So if they are building it around him‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre clueless. And if they‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ well, the new generation is screwed.

And a lot of it? Can be traced back to the captain of the ship. And the Osean military was not prepared for that ship to hit an iceberg. But with Air Command having been there since day one, there was just no way the Osean High Command were going to dump them like some morose piece of garbage.

‚Ä¶Right?

Right‚Ä¶

The unthinkable happened. The entirety of the Osean Air Command was fired from the OADF. The reign was over. A couple of other big wigs, close allies, were given their walking papers too.

Some say this mass firing was because Trigger had secretly signed with ERAF. And was the final straw for a total restructuring.

But is that true? Well, sort of.

Trigger will fly on into 2024, on exchange to the Erusean Air Force.

Let that sink in. The ace of aces. The golden boy. Now sporting orange and white. Albeit, only on loan.

So all of those highly publicised talks have come to nothing. That was a lot of effort by the ERAF to go through for just an exchange, so what was their play here? To pester Trigger over Oseas treatment of him to apply pressure to the Osean government so they would end up firing... Ohhh. Nahhh.

And sure, you could pin a lot of this on garden-variety Osean incompetence because there‚Äôs plenty of that to go around. But let‚Äôs not forget: without Air Command, the OADF would never have gotten to where it was. Though the fact that all of it was obliterated in the span of about a month? Yeah, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ borderline inconceivable.

Now? The OADF is under the control of a government committee. Bureaucrats who have no idea how the Air Force works. And by the way, the OADF having its actions dictated by a government committee was exactly the reason why the OADF fell into mediocrity, and also why Northrup and McDonnel Douglas left.

There doesn't seem to be any plan to close the technological gap and make the F-22 catch up to the rest for the new generation coming in, and if they can't come up with a new aircraft soon and another war breaks out, questions about its future will surface once again, and this time, Trigger won't be there to save them.

With Lockheed Martin leaving, and their star pilot looking for a complete way out rather than just an exchange, at this point, I think it‚Äôs fair to say: The OADF is falling apart.",0,1754472943.0,acecombat,0,0.5,False

1mj02mk,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuillandPen/comments/1mj02mk/my_dream_nightclub_somewhere_between_goth/,My dream nightclub ‚Äî somewhere between goth sanctuary and synthy nostalgia trip,"Wrote this recently after reminiscing about the kinds of clubs I used to love ‚Äî or maybe *wish* I‚Äôd had. It‚Äôs a little creative piece, set in a venue that lives somewhere between a ***Merseyside*** backstreet and a neon daydream.  
Would love to know what you lot think.

**The Neon Delight**

My favourite nightclub, *Neon Delight*, is only two minutes from a bus stop, yet it sits on a side street where drunks and chavs never seem to find their way, even on Saturday nights.

Its clientele, though fairly large, go there as much for conversation as for dancing. What appeals to me most about *Neon Delight* is what people call its ""atmosphere.""

Open every day except Sunday and Monday, it plays Gothic, EBM, Darkwave, Synthwave, Industrial, and Metal music; each night dedicated to a different genre, but never Pop.

Housed in an old bus depot built in the 1800s, its architecture is unapologetically Victorian, yet the interior is a fusion of Cyberpunk and *The Ha√ßienda*. Think neon signs, UV blacklights, and old CRT TVs.

The building is large enough to house three dance halls. The biggest, which we will call the Big Room, is the main space of *Neon Delight.* It's long and lined with elevated walkways running along the length of the room. Underneath these walkways are booths on one side and a large bar on the other.

The dance-floor is quite large and can comfortably hold a couple of hundred people. There's always room, and it's never cramped or chaotic. Above, at the very end of the hall, in the old foreman's office, where one would find the DJ booth, overlooking the room like a crow's nest.

In the next room, which we‚Äôll call the Other Room, is the second largest space. Similar in style to the Big Room, it's a bit darker and still holds more remnants of the previous tenant. It tends to host more niche nights.

Finally, we come to the last room, known as the Back Room. It's the smallest of the three and set up with a stage for live music. When there isn't a gig, there are numerous tables and chairs for a more relaxed vibe.

Speaking of relaxed vibes, the Carpenter Bar is where I find myself during visits to *Neon*. Once home to the workers' cafeteria, it was named in honour of John Carpenter, and it‚Äôs always quiet enough to have a conversation. The large cocktail menu with drinks named after pop culture references is very on brand. In here, you can also find a selection of retro arcade cabinets.

Food is served next door at the snack counter, where you can get tea, coffee, hamburgers, hot dogs and other refreshments at a reasonable price. All fresh and never microwaved. It's a point of pride of the gray-haired Goth lady who runs it and always calls everyone 'dear', irrespective of age or sex.

You‚Äôll never find yourself waiting long for a drink, no matter how busy it gets. The bar staff ‚Äî mostly lifers ‚Äî know their regulars by name and their orders by heart. Even newcomers get the same warm welcome, so long as they‚Äôre not being a dick. There‚Äôs an unspoken code at Neon: be decent, be weird, but never be rude. And it works.

The toilets are clean. No, really. They‚Äôre not pristine ‚Äî that would feel out of place ‚Äî but they‚Äôre always stocked, always dry, and someone has clearly taken the time to make sure the taps aren‚Äôt just decorative.

They‚Äôre particular about their drinking vessels at Neon Delight and never, for example, make the mistake of serving a pint of beer in a handleless glass. Alongside the usual glass and pewter mugs, they‚Äôve got those enamel-coated metal cups that are seldom seen these days. Enamel mugs went out decades ago ‚Äî most people like their drink to be visible, after all.

The great surprise of this club is its courtyard. You reach it by passing through a narrow side corridor from the Big Room ‚Äî echoing with bassline thumps and the occasional burst of laughter. The floor outside is still cobbled, and the old embedded tracks from the depot days remain ‚Äî twin iron scars running through the stone like a memory no one bothered to erase.

The area itself sits beneath part of the depot canopy, ringed by mismatched benches and patched-up planters made from reclaimed barrels. Patio heaters keep the worst of the chill off in winter, and in summer the space transforms: DJs spin outdoors, strings of coloured lights are slung across the beams, and someone always starts grilling something that smells far better than it has any right to.

People gather there to chain-smoke, flirt badly, and re-enter the world of the living before plunging back into strobes and synths.

The Neon Delight is my ideal of what a club should be ‚Äî at least in the Merseyside area.

But now is the time to reveal something the disillusioned reader ‚Äî or anyone with a nose for the obvious ‚Äî will likely have guessed already: there is no such place as the Neon Delight. Just a pastiche of Orwell‚Äôs *Moon Under Water*.

That is to say, there may well be a club of that name, but I don‚Äôt know of it, nor do I know any venue with quite that combination of qualities.

It‚Äôs very much something that could only exist in a dream or on a screen. These qualities for my perfect nightclub came from my disinclination to go out ‚Äî and the growing need to be somewhere an old metalhead can chill, listen to good music, and enjoy good company. Maybe it‚Äôs age, but clubs now can feel so antisocial or overwhelming.

If anyone knows of a place like this, I‚Äôd be glad to hear of it ‚Äî even if its name was something as prosaic as *Satan‚Äôs Hollow* or *Diego‚Äôs Demise*.",1,1754472700.0,QuillandPen,0,1.0,False

Sooooo‚Ä¶ my question is - how do I go about dating a friend well? Most of my date ideas are for dates where you don‚Äôt really know each other beforehand - go for coffee, a walk, a dinner, ask all the small talk questions and chat about what we do. She‚Äôs a super creative and outdoorsy person and all of these options just feel a bit too basic (but maybe I‚Äôm overthinking it). Any ideas? Do I bring flowers (picking some wildflowers on my way home, or buying a bouquet)? Do I straight up tell her how much I really like her?

Sorry for the dumb questions, this all feels like new territory and I feel like I‚Äôm dating for the first time all over again.",1,1754472676.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

1mizyi7,https://youtu.be/SvuitZvrrWo,3 Very Scary TRUE Appalachian Trail Thru-Hiker Horror Stories,"# ""The Wrong Companion"":

I had been dreaming about hiking the Appalachian Trail for as long as I could remember. The idea of walking through the wilderness, from Georgia to Maine, was thrilling. The trail promised adventure, solitude, and a chance to test myself against nature. But since I couldn‚Äôt afford to take several months off work, I decided to start with a section hike in Maine. I figured starting at Baxter State Park and heading southbound would be a perfect introduction to the trail life.

I didn‚Äôt want to go alone, so I teamed up with two guys from my Roswell, my college town. Blake and Jerkwad‚Äîthough I didn‚Äôt know Jerkwad‚Äôs true nature when we started. Blake was quiet, respectful, always ready with a smile and a helping hand. Jerkwad seemed enthusiastic about the hike, and I thought his energy would make him a good companion. I couldn‚Äôt have been more wrong.

The day we started, my parents drove us five hours from New Hampshire to Baxter State Park. I was buzzing with excitement, my backpack loaded with gear I‚Äôd spent months researching and buying. At the South Gate, we met a ranger who was friendly, giving us tips on trail conditions and safety. But as soon as he turned away, Jerkwad muttered, ‚ÄúWhat a shady guy.‚Äù I thought he was joking, but then he added, ‚ÄúThat guy‚Äôs an ass.‚Äù I was stunned. Why would he insult someone just doing their job?

Blake and I exchanged a glance, both of us confused. ‚ÄúJust ignore him,‚Äù Blake whispered, adjusting his pack. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get moving.‚Äù I nodded, not wanting to start the hike on a bad note, and we set off down the trail.

The first few miles were everything I‚Äôd hoped for. The trail was well-marked, winding through dense forests of towering pines and rocky outcrops. The air smelled of earth and evergreen, and a distant stream gurgled softly. But Jerkwad‚Äôs behavior quickly soured the experience. He started yelling‚Äîswear words, racial slurs, things I won‚Äôt repeat. A family hiking nearby shot us uncomfortable looks, their kids trailing behind them. My face burned with embarrassment. ‚ÄúHey, can you keep it down?‚Äù I said, trying to sound calm. ‚ÄúThere are people around.‚Äù

Jerkwad laughed, his voice grating. ‚ÄúRelax, man. It‚Äôs just words. Lighten up.‚Äù But he didn‚Äôt stop. If anything, he got louder, belting out offensive lyrics like he was performing for an audience. I wanted to disappear into the trees.

Then came the caterpillar incident. We were on a flat stretch of trail when Jerkwad spotted a small caterpillar inching across the path. Instead of stepping over it, he stopped, picked it up with a stick, and flicked open his lighter. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see if it‚Äôs alive,‚Äù he said with a grin that made my skin crawl. He set the caterpillar on fire, watching as it writhed and burned into a charred husk. I felt sick. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you?‚Äù I snapped, my voice shaking.

He shrugged, unfazed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bug. Chill out.‚Äù His casual cruelty made my stomach turn, but we were miles from anywhere, so I kept walking, keeping my distance.

It got worse. Jerkwad pulled out a buck knife and started stabbing trees along the trail. ‚ÄúThis is how you mark your territory,‚Äù he said, plunging the blade into a thick oak. Then he threw the knife at a stump. It hit with a thud, and the blade snapped off. I thought that might slow him down, but he just laughed and pulled a two-foot machete from his pack. ‚ÄúMeet Henry VII,‚Äù he said, waving it around like a trophy. ‚ÄúMy favorite weapon.‚Äù My heart raced. This guy wasn‚Äôt just annoying‚Äîhe was dangerous.

As the day dragged on, Jerkwad‚Äôs complaints grew louder. Then launched into rants about Mormons, Canadians, anyone he could think of. It was like he was trying to pick a fight with the entire state. At one point, he started kicking apart the stone cairns that mark the trail. ‚ÄúWho needs these stupid things?‚Äù he said, scattering rocks across the path. I bit my lip, my hands clenched into fists. Those markers could save our lives if we got lost, and he was destroying them.

The hike itself was grueling. After 13 hours, my hips and knees felt like they were grinding to dust. Every step was agony, and Jerkwad‚Äôs chaos made it unbearable. Blake was holding up better, but even he looked worn out, his eyes darting nervously toward Jerkwad every time he raised his voice.

We stopped for a break in a small clearing. I collapsed onto a rock, my legs trembling. Blake sat beside me, pulling out a map. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked quietly, his voice low so Jerkwad wouldn‚Äôt hear.

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can do this. My body‚Äôs falling apart, and‚Ä¶ him.‚Äù I nodded toward Jerkwad, who was now hacking at a sapling with his machete, muttering to himself.

Blake sighed, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúYeah, he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ a lot. But we‚Äôre almost at camp. Just a little further.‚Äù

I nodded, but inside, I was crumbling. This was supposed to be the adventure of a lifetime, but it felt like a trap.

The sun was setting, the forest growing darker, shadows stretching across the trail. Jerkwad‚Äôs antics didn‚Äôt stop. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all gonna burn!‚Äù he yelled at the trees, swinging his machete wildly. I stayed as far back as I could, but the trail was narrow, and his voice echoed in my head.

Then, things took a turn. We hit a steep, rocky drop-off where the trail dipped sharply. Jerkwad, still waving his machete, lost his footing and slid down a small embankment, landing hard. Clutching his leg. ‚ÄúI think I twisted my ankle.‚Äù

Blake and I scrambled down to help, but Jerkwad shoved us away. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch me! I‚Äôm fine!‚Äù He struggled to his feet, limping but refusing help. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep going. I‚Äôm not quitting.‚Äù

We hiked in silence after that, the air thick with tension. My body screamed for rest, but every time I thought about stopping, I saw Jerkwad‚Äôs wild grin, his machete glinting in the fading light. I didn‚Äôt feel safe.

We finally reached a campsite near a stream. I dropped my pack and sank to the ground, too exhausted to set up my tent. Blake started gathering wood for a fire, while Jerkwad limped around, muttering curses. As we sat by the fire that night, I leaned toward Blake. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do this,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to get us killed.‚Äù

Blake nodded, his face grim. ‚ÄúI know. But what can we do? We‚Äôre stuck out here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not,‚Äù I said, my voice barely audible. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going home.‚Äù

He looked at me, surprised. ‚ÄúYou sure? It‚Äôs a long way back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather walk all night than spend another day with him.‚Äù

The next morning, while Jerkwad was still asleep, I packed my bag and told Blake my plan. ‚ÄúCall me when you‚Äôre done,‚Äù he said, his voice heavy. ‚ÄúStay safe.‚Äù

I hiked back to the nearest road, each step a battle against my aching body. It took five hours for my parents to pick me up. While I waited, I sat by the trail, feeling like I‚Äôd failed. A woman hiked by, her accent hinting at Australia or New Zealand. She saw me sitting there, looking defeated, and stopped. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù she asked, her voice kind.

I forced a smile. ‚ÄúRough day. Bad hiking partner.‚Äù

She sat beside me. ‚ÄúHiking‚Äôs tough,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut don‚Äôt let one bad day ruin it. Katahdin‚Äôs a beast, but it‚Äôs worth it.‚Äù

Her words were kind, but I knew I was done. The trail was beautiful, but it had shown me its dark side.

When my parents arrived, I climbed into the car, my gear piled in the back. As we drove away, I looked back at the trail one last time. It was stunning, but it had become a place of fear.

I never heard from Blake or Jerkwad again. I hope they made it, but I‚Äôll never know. That one day on the Appalachian Trail taught me a hard lesson: the wilderness is unforgiving, and so are the people you choose to share it with.





# ""Red Bandana on the Branch"":

Ever since I was a kid, flipping through books about adventure and survival, I knew this was something I had to do. The idea of trekking through hundreds of miles of wilderness, relying only on myself and nature, felt like the ultimate test of resilience. So, when I finally set out on my thru-hike, I was ready for the challenge‚Äîor so I thought.

It was late spring when I started my journey from Springer Mountain in Georgia. The first few weeks were tough but exhilarating. My legs ached from the constant uphill climbs, and my shoulders burned under the weight of my pack, but every sunrise over the mountains made it worth it. I met other hikers along the way‚Äîfriendly faces who shared stories around campfires and traded trail snacks. We called ourselves ""thru-hikers,"" a tight-knit community bound by our shared goal of reaching Maine.

By the time I reached Pennsylvania, I was halfway through my journey. The trail here was different‚Äîrockier, with more elevation changes, and the forests felt denser, almost oppressive at times. I had been hiking alone for a few days, enjoying the solitude after weeks of constant company. It was peaceful, just me and the rhythm of my footsteps on the dirt path.

That morning, I woke up early, as usual. My tent was pitched in a small clearing near a stream, and the air was cool and damp. I packed up quickly, eager to get moving. I had heard from other hikers that there was a small town called Duncannon not far ahead, a popular stop for resupplying and resting. I was looking forward to a hot meal and a bed for the night.

The trail was quiet that day. Too quiet, maybe. Normally, I‚Äôd hear birds chirping or squirrels darting through the underbrush, but today, the forest seemed to hold its breath. I tried to shake off the uneasy feeling, telling myself it was just my imagination. But as I hiked, I couldn‚Äôt ignore the faint smell that began to drift through the air. It was sharp and metallic, like blood, mixed with something else I couldn‚Äôt quite place.

I stopped for a moment, scanning the trail ahead. The path curved around a bend, disappearing into a thicker part of the woods. My heart started to race, though I didn‚Äôt know why. I told myself it was probably just a dead animal nearby, something natural. But the smell grew stronger as I continued, and with it came a sense of dread I couldn‚Äôt explain.

When I rounded the bend, I saw it‚Äîa small clearing just off the trail. And there, hanging from a sturdy branch of an oak tree, was a body. A young man, dressed in hiking gear, his face pale and lifeless. His backpack lay discarded on the ground beneath him, its contents spilling out.

I froze. My mind couldn‚Äôt process what I was seeing. Was this real? It had to be a dream, a nightmare. But no, the sight was all too vivid. The rope around his neck, the way his body swayed slightly in the breeze‚Äîit was real. Too real.

I wanted to scream, to run, but my legs wouldn‚Äôt move. I forced myself to step closer, hoping against hope that he might still be alive. ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I called out, my voice trembling. ‚ÄúCan you hear me?‚Äù

There was no response. Of course there wasn‚Äôt. He was gone. His eyes were open, staring blankly into the distance, and his skin had a waxy, lifeless quality. I felt bile rise in my throat, but I swallowed it down. I had to do something.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do next. I‚Äôm not a doctor, not trained for this kind of thing. My mind raced. There had to be someone I could tell, someone who could help. I remembered Duncannon wasn‚Äôt far‚Äîmaybe a couple of hours‚Äô hike at most. I could get there and alert the authorities.

But I couldn‚Äôt just leave him like this. What if someone else came along? What if animals... I shuddered at the thought. I needed to mark the spot so I could lead someone back here. I took off my red bandana and tied it to a low-hanging branch near the trail. Then, with one last look at the tragic scene, I turned and started hiking toward Duncannon as fast as my legs would carry me.

The trail felt longer than ever. Every step was heavy, my mind replaying the image of the hanged man over and over. Who was he? Why did he do this? Was there something I could have done to stop it? The questions swirled in my head, but I pushed them aside. I had to focus on getting help.

After what felt like an eternity, I finally reached the outskirts of Duncannon. The town was small, with a few shops and a hostel for thru-hikers. I headed straight for the general store, where I knew there was a phone. The store was empty except for the clerk, a middle-aged woman with a kind face. She looked up as I entered, her smile fading when she saw my expression.

‚ÄúYou okay, hon?‚Äù she asked.

I shook my head, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI need to use your phone. It‚Äôs an emergency.‚Äù

She pointed to the phone on the counter without hesitation. ‚ÄúGo ahead.‚Äù

I dialed 911 with shaking hands and reported what I‚Äôd found. The operator assured me that someone would be sent right away and asked me to wait at the store. While I waited, the clerk brought me a cup of coffee. ‚ÄúYou look like you need this,‚Äù she said gently.

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù I replied, my hands still trembling as I took the cup. The warmth was comforting, but it couldn‚Äôt erase the chill that had settled in my bones.

A few minutes later, two police officers arrived. They were from the local sheriff‚Äôs department‚Äîa burly man with a mustache and a younger woman with a serious expression. I explained what had happened, describing the location as best I could. They asked me to lead them back to the spot.

The hike back felt surreal. The officers walked ahead, their radios crackling with static, while I trailed behind, my legs heavy with dread. When we reached the clearing, the body was still there, just as I‚Äôd left it. The officers immediately took charge, securing the area and calling for backup.

I stood back, watching as they worked. One of them climbed up and cut the rope, lowering the body gently to the ground. They checked for any signs of life, though it was clear there were none. After a while, the female officer came over to me.

‚ÄúThank you for reporting this,‚Äù she said, her voice steady but kind. ‚ÄúI know it must have been traumatic for you.‚Äù

I nodded, still in shock. ‚ÄúDo you know who he is?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNot yet. We‚Äôll have to run his description and see if anyone matches it from missing persons reports. Did you notice anything else? Any notes or anything?‚Äù

I thought back. ‚ÄúThere was a backpack on the ground. Maybe there‚Äôs something in there.‚Äù

The officer went over to the backpack and carefully opened it. Inside, she found a wallet, some food, and a small notebook. She flipped through the notebook and found an entry from the day before. ‚ÄúIt says here that he was struggling with depression and felt like he couldn‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she read aloud. ‚ÄúHe wrote that he didn‚Äôt want to burden his family anymore.‚Äù

I felt a lump form in my throat. ‚ÄúSo, it was suicide?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt appears so,‚Äù she said solemnly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to confirm with the medical examiner, but based on this, it seems likely.‚Äù

I felt a wave of sadness wash over me. This young man had been suffering, and now he was gone. And I was the one who found him. It felt like too much to bear.

The officers finished their initial investigation and arranged for the body to be transported to the morgue. They thanked me again for my help and told me I was free to go. But as I stood there, watching them load the stretcher into the van, I knew I couldn‚Äôt continue my hike. The trail no longer felt like a place of adventure; it felt haunted by this tragedy.

That evening, I stayed at the hostel in Duncannon. The common area was filled with other hikers, laughing and sharing stories, but I couldn‚Äôt join in. I sat in a corner, staring at my hands, still seeing the image of the hanged man every time I closed my eyes.

A hiker named Jake noticed me and came over. He was a few years older than me, with a beard and a friendly demeanor. ‚ÄúYou look like you‚Äôve seen a ghost,‚Äù he said, sitting down across from me.

I hesitated, then told him what had happened. His face grew serious as I spoke. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs rough, man,‚Äù he said when I finished. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard stories like that before, but never thought I‚Äôd meet someone who actually found one.‚Äù

‚ÄúHas this happened before on the trail?‚Äù I asked.

Jake nodded. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, yeah. The trail can be tough on people, mentally and physically. Some don‚Äôt make it.‚Äù

We talked for a while longer, but my heart wasn‚Äôt in it. All I could think about was the young man and his family, who would soon learn of his fate.

The next morning, I made a decision. I couldn‚Äôt go on. The Appalachian Trail had been my dream, but now it felt like a nightmare. I packed up my things and caught a bus back home.

As the landscape passed by outside the window, I reflected on my experience. The trail had given me so much‚Äîstrength, resilience, a sense of accomplishment‚Äîbut it had also taken something from me that day. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever return to finish my thru-hike. Maybe one day, when the memory fades, I‚Äôll give it another shot. But for now, I need time to heal, to process what I saw and felt.

One thing is certain: the Appalachian Trail is not just a path through the woods; it‚Äôs a journey through the human spirit, with all its triumphs and tragedies. And sometimes, those tragedies are the hardest to leave behind.





# ""Mile Marker of Madness"":

Hiking the Appalachian Trail, a 2,190-mile journey from Georgia to Maine. In early May 2019, I set out with two friends, Alex and Chris, and another hiker we‚Äôd met along the way. Alex was a seasoned hiker, having tackled several long trails, while Chris was newer but full of enthusiasm. We planned to hike together for a few weeks, sharing the adventure and the challenges.

After two weeks, we reached southwest Virginia. The trail was stunning‚Äîtowering trees, babbling streams, and the kind of quiet that makes you feel like you‚Äôre the only person in the world. We were averaging 15 miles a day, our packs heavy but our spirits high. That evening, we found a secluded spot near a small stream to set up camp. As we unpacked our gear and started a small fire, a man approached. He was tall, with a scruffy beard and wild eyes, carrying a large backpack. His dog, a friendly-looking mutt, trotted beside him.

‚ÄúHey there,‚Äù he called out, his voice rough. ‚ÄúMind if I join you for the night?‚Äù

We exchanged quick glances. Sharing campsites is common on the trail, and he didn‚Äôt seem threatening at first. ‚ÄúSure, no problem,‚Äù I replied, trying to sound welcoming.

He introduced himself as Sovereign, a trail name he‚Äôd chosen. He told us about his journey and his dog, Felicia, who wagged her tail as we tossed her a bit of food. We chatted for a while, sharing stories of the trail. But as the sun dipped below the horizon, Sovereign‚Äôs demeanor shifted. He started ranting about conspiracy theories‚Äîhow the government was tracking hikers with GPS devices, how nobody could be trusted. Alex tried to lighten the mood, asking about his favorite trails, but Sovereign‚Äôs voice grew sharper, his eyes darting around.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù he snapped. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre watching us. All of us.‚Äù

Chris laughed nervously, trying to defuse the tension. ‚ÄúHey, man, we‚Äôre just here to hike. No government spies here.‚Äù

Sovereign didn‚Äôt laugh. He stared at us, his expression unreadable, then turned away to set up his tent. We decided to keep an eye on him but didn‚Äôt think much of it. The trail attracts all kinds of people, and we‚Äôd met our share of eccentrics.

As night fell, the forest grew darker, the only sounds the crackle of our fire and the distant hoot of an owl. I crawled into my tent, exhausted but uneasy. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off. Hours later, I woke to Sovereign‚Äôs voice outside, muttering to himself. His words were low, almost a growl‚Äî‚ÄúThey‚Äôre coming,‚Äù ‚ÄúI have to protect myself.‚Äù My stomach tightened. I whispered to Alex and Chris in the next tent, but they were fast asleep.

Around midnight, a loud rustling jolted me awake. I peeked through the tent flap and saw Sovereign standing over our backpacks, a 20-inch knife in his hand. The blade caught the moonlight, glinting like a warning. My heart pounded so hard I thought it might burst. He was rifling through our gear, his movements frantic.

I shook Alex and Chris awake, whispering, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a knife. We need to get out of here.‚Äù

Before we could move, Sovereign spun toward us, his eyes blazing with rage. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre part of them, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù he shouted. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trying to stop me!‚Äù

He lunged, the knife slashing through the air. I grabbed my hiking pole, swinging it wildly, but he was too fast. The blade caught my arm, slicing deep. Pain seared through me as blood soaked my sleeve. Alex screamed as Sovereign turned on Chris, stabbing him in the chest. Chris crumpled to the ground, motionless.

I fumbled for my GPS device, my hands shaking so badly I could barely press the emergency button. I prayed the signal would reach someone. Sovereign was now after Alex, who was fighting to keep him at bay. I grabbed a rock and swung it with all my strength, hitting Sovereign on the head. He stumbled, dazed, giving us a split second to run.

We bolted into the woods, branches snapping underfoot, Sovereign‚Äôs shouts echoing behind us. His dog‚Äôs barking added to the chaos, a relentless reminder of the danger at our heels. My arm throbbed, blood dripping as we ran, but fear kept me moving. We stumbled through the darkness, not knowing where we were going, just desperate to escape.

After what felt like forever, we spotted a faint glow‚Äîa group of hikers setting up camp. We staggered toward them, gasping for breath. ‚ÄúHelp us!‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a knife!‚Äù

The hikers took us in, their faces pale with shock. One had a satellite phone and called for help. Park rangers and police arrived, their flashlights cutting through the night. They found Sovereign not far away, still clutching his knife, his dog by his side. He was arrested on the spot.

Chris was rushed to the hospital, but he didn‚Äôt make it. The loss hit like a tidal wave, leaving me numb. My arm needed stitches, and Alex was shaken but physically unharmed. We later learned Sovereign‚Äôs real name was James L. Jordan, a 30-year-old from Massachusetts with a history of mental illness. He‚Äôd been on the trail for weeks, acting erratically, threatening other hikers. In Tennessee, he‚Äôd been arrested for minor charges but was released, with no one realizing the danger he posed.

The attack shook the Appalachian Trail community. Hikers shared stories of their own unsettling encounters with Jordan, who called himself ‚Äúthe captain of the hit squad‚Äù and had been seen trashing shelters and threatening to burn tents. The incident was a stark reminder that, while rare, human danger can lurk even in the wilderness.

I continued my hike, but it wasn‚Äôt the same. I was more cautious, always checking over my shoulder, sticking close to other hikers. The trail‚Äôs beauty remained, but it was forever tainted by that night of terror. I carry the scars‚Äîon my arm and in my mind‚Äîas a reminder of how quickly peace can turn to horror.",1,1754472264.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of inside print hinges on numerous factors, including printing technology, material compatibility, design complexity, and cost-effectiveness. Several options are at your disposal, each with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses.

**Digital Printing Capabilities**

Digital printing allows for highly customized and variable data printing on the interior surfaces. This includes things like QR codes, unique serial numbers, or individual personalized messages. The ability to change the print on-the-fly makes it ideal for marketing campaigns that track performance or offer personalized experiences.

Digital printing utilizes inkjet or laser technology to transfer images directly from a digital file to the substrate. This generally doesn't require printing plates,which reduces setup costs and allows for speedy turnaround times,this also makes it excellent for short-run jobs. Its versatility, however, makes it an exceptional choice when vibrant, high-resolution images are necesary.

**Flexographic Printing Precision**

Flexographic printing is a rotary printing method that utilizes flexible printing plates. It's particularly well-suited for long-run jobs on a variety of materials, including paper, cardboard, film, and foil. Flexography is known for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness when handling large volumes.

Flexographic printing employs fast-drying inks, offering a reliable, high-speed printing process. While not always as precise as digital printing for intricate details, it excels in printing solid colors and repeating patterns. Newer high-resolution flexo equipment is continually blurring the line of print quality between digital and flexographic printing.

**Offset Lithography Quality**

Offset lithography produces high-quality prints with sharp details and vivid colors. This technique is ideal for printing on smooth surfaces,particularly paper and board. The offset process involves transferring the ink from a plate to a rubber blanket, and then to the printing surface.

Offset lithography is renowned for its color accuracy and ability to reproduce fine details. The cost-effectiveness of offset lithography becomes apparent when printing large quantities, making it a favored choice for books, magazines, and high-end packaging.While it is indeed typically used for ‚Äútraditional‚Äù print such as brochures, the print quality can be suitable for inside printing.

**Material Compatibility Spectrum**

The chosen printing technology must be compatible with the material being printed on. Some technologies, like flexography, can work with a wide range of substrates, while others, like offset lithography, are better suited for smoother, more absorbent surfaces. Understanding the material properties is crucial for achieving optimal print quality and durability.

When selecting an inside print option,consider the specific material construction and how it might effect the printing process. For instance, printing on porous materials may require special inks or coatings to prevent ink bleed, whereas printing on glossy surfaces might require proper adhesion to ensure print longevity.

**specialty Ink Options**

Specialty inks can add unique and impactful elements to inside prints. These include metallic inks, fluorescent inks, thermochromic inks (changing color with temperature), and even scented inks. Incorporating these specialty inks can greatly enhance the visual and sensory appeal of products.

The usage of specialty inks encourages creativity and differentiation. For example, utilizing glow-in-the-dark inks can create surprise elements in a nighttime reveal, while using metallic inks adds a touch of luxury and sophistication to the packaging design.

1mizr71,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1mizr71/restraining_order/,Restraining Order?,"I have been with my boyfriend for almost a year and a half but we have known each other for much longer.
After my previous, disastrous relationship I decided that I don‚Äôt trust my judgement, and I can‚Äôt risk that kind of trauma again. Then I bumped into this guy who I met in high school at a friend‚Äôs 50th.
He has been in ongoing legal dramas with his ex wife over money and custody for years now, and I have always been supportive and sympathetic based on the side of the story I have gotten. There have been accusations going both ways.
She has accused him of things which have led to the courts not approving his request for more time with the children.
He has never shown me any aggressive or angry side, although he is very controlling and financially, if he cannot get it for free or at a charity store, he won‚Äôt buy it. He is on a six figure wage, and does not pay rent as he moved back in with his parents 2 years ago after the breakdown of his marriage.
As I write this, I feel like I am answering my own question, to be honest‚Ä¶.
He is very measured and overly obsessive about posting about his ‚ÄúSuper Fun Family‚Äù days with his kids on social media and does a photo collage of them 3-5 times per week. Photos are very often unflattering to the point where I have mentioned they are inappropriate. Kids ‚Äúhaving fun with Dad‚Äù but when I‚Äôve said ‚Äúhey delete that photo of your daughter with her legs apart in a short nightie‚Äù or ‚Äúdoes your son know you‚Äôve put a photo of him on the internet in his jocks running around the yard?‚Äù And he‚Äôs gotten very angry and defensive.
‚ÄúMy profile is locked down and private and her lawyer can‚Äôt see any of it‚Äù.
So I have been going off him for a while. I just don‚Äôt see things the way he does. At all. I don‚Äôt see a future.
I have been pulling away for some time. 
My mother died 2 weeks ago, and when that happened he was unsupportive and still banging on about how his ex wants 50% of his car‚Äôs value or whatever (who even cares).
When my mother passed, he posted a collage of his kids and him having the ‚ÄúBest Wednesday Ever!!‚Äù on Facebook.
That was me done.
After several days of caring phone calls, home cooked meals dropped off my friends, beautiful flowers being delivered, people dropping in to see how my kids were, and to have a coffee and ask what I need, he had still not phoned or visited. 
He sent some text messages saying ‚ÄúSending hugs‚Äù and some text messages complaining about his ex-wife and talking about a custody hearing coming up in a few months.
So after a few days, I messaged and said let‚Äôs just call this off, I am going through a lot, you‚Äôre so self involved and I‚Äôm not giving that energy away.
I then blocked his number so that I didn‚Äôt have to deal with that, and could just focus on my family.
What is it they say?  The opposite of love is indifference?
A few days pass, I‚Äôm getting ready for my mum‚Äôs funeral and he shows up at my front door, very aggressive, my kids are right there with me. He‚Äôs telling me to open the door, and says he wants his ‚Äústuff‚Äù and if I don‚Äôt give it to him immediately he‚Äôs calling the police and having me arrested for theft.
E.g. I have the monogrammed bath towel I gave him for Christmas still sitting on a hook on the door; he didn‚Äôt like my coffee machine, told me to put it in the garage and proudly brought over a Nespresso pod machine ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 3 in the shed from Buy Nothing, I‚Äôll bring one over. It‚Äôll be better‚Äù. An assortment of stuff he didn‚Äôt urgently need in that moment.
Long story long, I told him to get off my property, he was very very nasty and scary, told me he knows the law (he works in that field), he will call the police and have me arrested for theft. ‚ÄúYou are a thief!!!‚Äù
The minute I told my (adult) daughter to start videoing he walked away from the front door and went and stood on the footpath and pulled a Jekyll and Hyde - suddenly super meek and mild, softly spoken. Then when I got close to him he stopped speaking and just smirked at me.
I yelled at him to get away from my property, and I guess as he knew he was being recorded he got in his car and drove away.
I really lost my shit. I absolutely snapped.
My kids were in tears. I called the police who arrived in less than an hour and interviewed me and my kids both together and separately. Things have changed in recent years, that‚Äôs for sure. I felt like we were seen and heard and understood and sympathised with. Thank God.
2 hours later the police drove to his house - an hour south of us - and served him with a 72 hour stay away order.
Apparently he was ‚ÄúVERY unhappy‚Äù at the police when they turned up to his house.
The stay away order has now lapsed and they asked if I will apply for a restraining order. He didn‚Äôt put his hands on me, but he also threatened to have me arrested in front of my children when I was at my most vulnerable.
I am scared he will do this again because he got a kick out of how upset I got.
He is very aware that my previous partner was abusive and I had to get a restraining order against him - about 5 years ago.
That partner then put the next woman he dated in the hospital. So this isn‚Äôt a game to me. I have a very traumatic past and a very real fear and HE KNOWS THAT.
So‚Ä¶he and his ex wife have ongoing custody and financial court stuff happening. 
If I get a restraining order am I doing it for my peace of mind or for the physical safety of my family? And does it matter? 
Then, if I do get it, will it impact his family court cases with his ex wife? That‚Äôs not my intention. That‚Äôs not my business, it‚Äôs a completely separate issue. If he fails to get what he wants with his ex wife, I don‚Äôt want to have a part in it. 
Not my circus, not my monkey.
I feel really bloody conflicted.
It‚Äôs not a small decision and it can have far reaching consequences.

From morning coffee to late-night creative projects, AI tools are sneaking into every corner of daily life and work. If the last year taught us anything, it‚Äôs that the possibilities are bright and dizzying.

Here‚Äôs why I find the rise of AI automation so genuinely exciting:

- **Speed and Precision:** Tasks that used to gobble up my afternoons (basic data entry or sorting through endless emails) now wrap up in a sliver of the time. That means more creative bandwidth left for things I actually care about.  
- **Accessibility Explosion:** With AI automations, so many barriers are coming down. Powerful design, coding, music creation‚Äîsuddenly, these aren‚Äôt just for specialists but almost anyone with a bit of curiosity and an internet connection.
- **Unlocking Human Ingenuity:** When AI takes on the tedious stuff, we get to focus on innovation. The energy once wasted on repetitive chores gets channeled into new ideas, art, and problem-solving.

Just imagine the engines running behind the digital scenes, handling:

- Social media scheduling, so your content pops up like magic (even while you‚Äôre off hiking)
- Smart writing assistants that nudge you past writer‚Äôs block (how awesome is that?!)
- Data crunching at speeds that leave even the fastest analysts amazed

It‚Äôs hard not to get giddy thinking about how much human potential may erupt once millions are freed up to *build, create, and play*.

It‚Äôs not just about slashing hours of work. It‚Äôs about:

- **Dreaming bigger because we finally have the tools to chase those dreams**
- **Connecting with more people, across more platforms, and languages, effortlessly**
- **Personalizing experiences at scale‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs tailored learning, music, or memes that seem made just for you**

While yes, some challenges and questions are ahead (ethics, jobs, change fatigue, anyone?), the horizon is bright. We‚Äôre perched at a once-in-a-generation moment to redefine what we can do, both as individuals and together.

So‚Äîare you using AI to automate some part of your life or work? What‚Äôs the coolest/most freeing thing you‚Äôve seen or tried lately?

‚ÄúGET HIM! Kill him! Dad! Did you see!¬† Red knight is so cool!‚Äù¬† Chris turned to Adam with a big grin, before turning back to the two giant mechas that were fighting in the lava Colosseum. Adam just smiled as all the kids stood by the giant window watching the mecha fight.¬† He could not believe the years had gone by so fast. Chris and Wei were already eleven, and the girls were pretending not to care, but he knew them too well; those little princesses wanted nothing more than to fight with Roks‚Äô kids.¬† Then it was little Sam, the calm, intelligent one, who watched silently, taking it all in as if he were plotting or predicting something.

The beast was standing guard, just as confused as always. Too many kids to look after, especially during a birthday party.¬† There were about 30 of them running around. Roks stood next to him, watching the match.

‚ÄúJust tell me again why I can't have Mechas for military use?‚Äù He asked as the red knight decapitated a giant silver robot and kicked a Haran-looking mecha into the walls.

‚ÄúBecause this is all fun and games and they are just, as you said, giant targets in a firefight.‚Äù Adam said.

‚ÄúStill, it would look cool and scare the hell out of anybody on the battlefield. And it would be great for the battlegrounds. The league needs something new.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou still going on about that?‚Äù Adam replied. ‚ÄúOkay, I give in, but make it a separate league, like a fantasy war ground. Battlegrounds are supposed to stop wars, and it needs to be serious.‚Äù Adam replied, and Roks grinned, then turned to Arus and Knug, who were waiting.

‚ÄúWe got it, only took us ten years of nagging!‚Äù

The two grinned, and Arus immediately went to his pad and started working. Adam shook his head.

‚ÄúYou're still kids!‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course they are,‚Äù Evelyn said as she came over to them.¬† Mother of six and still as beautiful as the day she landed on Dirt. Adam just smiled at her as some of the kids started to play Red Knight and robots.

Some idiot had told her about a long-dead civilization on Hunad-7 and a royal tomb that should, in theory, contain a library. ¬†It‚Äôs a holy site for the Bylgyno and could have caused an incident.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe will never change. Remember when she snuck into the Holy Wossir library to copy all the text?‚Äù Adam said with a smile.

‚ÄúYeah, it's almost impossible to get her out of her library unless you're Mr. Arus over there, except if you tell her about a long lost book, then she will be packed and ready at the shuttle before you can say hello.‚Äù Evelyn said, and they both laughed.

‚ÄúWhat are you laughing at?‚Äù Sarah asked as she suddenly stood in front of them, holding a little Wossir girl's hand. They both smiled at them.

‚ÄúOh, Daddy just said something silly.¬† Have you tried the ice cream yet?‚Äù Evelyn said, ‚ÄúRemember it's Wei and Chris's birthday, so you can eat today.‚Äù

Sarah looked at them. She wanted to ask about the funny thing, but then there was also ice cream, and ice cream won. They both looked as their youngest ran to the next room to get ice cream, something that the other kids did not miss, mostly due to her screaming ‚ÄúICECREAM‚Äù as she ran. Half the room ran after her.  
  


Adam just looked at her. ‚ÄúYou had to mention the ice cream.‚Äù They both smiled as they look back at the window where the red knight had won yet another battle. The giant robot walked over to the VIP section, knelt in front of the glass, and started to sing Happy birthday to the twins, who looked at each other in a mix of horror and delight. ¬†Evelyn chuckled.

‚ÄúDid you get him into that?‚Äù

‚ÄúMe? No, this is all Kywars' idea. I didn‚Äôt even know he would do that.‚Äù Adam said as the red knight finished and walked back to its stall, to the cheers from the audience. It was another popular export of Dirt besides droids, ships, coffee, and the battleground games. The mecha tournament had even spread beyond the sector, and the Mars tournament was one of the biggest. But the one Adam was most proud of was the university; young adults from around the galaxy came here to learn and share knowledge. But what did the people of the galaxy want? Giant mecha suits fighting in impossible arenas or big space battles on the screen.

Or as Adam saw it, the whole galaxy could be compared to a damn kindergarten, where fights could break out over nothing, and it was easy to distract them with something shiny or a fun story. ¬†That was, after all, how he had survived for the last ten years. Bread and circuses.

He kissed his kids goodbye as he had to work, the council of administrators was coming up.

Archie followed him as he walked to the shuttle and flew toward Sistan.¬† Halfway there, he called out.

¬†‚ÄúYou can come out.‚Äù He said, and two kids came out from the toilet.

‚ÄúI told you he would know.‚Äù Chris said, and Sam whispered, ‚ÄúIt was worth a try.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sending us home?‚Äù Chris asked, and¬† Adam shook his head,

‚ÄúNope, I‚Äôm already late. You guys have to be quiet. But it's going to be boring, just remember you chose this.‚Äù Adam said and the boys sat down and strapped themself in.

‚ÄúBy the way, Archie, why didn‚Äôt you inform me they had sneaked onboard?‚Äù Adam asked, and the android turned to him. Jork had been upgrading him for ten years now, and there were some bugs.

‚ÄúBecause they told me it was a surprise, sir. Besides, it's important for children to observe their parents' work.‚Äù He replied in the now familiar voice, and the boys grinned.

‚ÄúUncle Archie knows. You should listen to him.‚Äù Sam said.

Adam was about to answer when Evelyn called, and he answered. ‚ÄúDo you have Chris and Sam with you? They are about to cut the cake!‚Äù

‚ÄúThey snuck onboard the shuttle, Archie felt they needed to observe my administration meeting.‚Äù

‚ÄúHi, mum!‚Äù the boys shouted, and Chris added, ‚ÄúJust cut the cake, we will be fine!‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, if that‚Äôs what you want, it's your birthday, remember. Have fun.‚Äù She replied, and the boys looked surprisingly happy as Adam said goodbye to Evelyn and continued to Sistun.

Chris and Sam were the ones most like him, in their different way. Like him, they never found much need for large celebrations and always tried to help people around them. Wei was the warrior of the family and the girls. Well, they could all manipulate him to do stupid things, as Evelyn said. His little tomboy princesses.

¬†When he landed, he was greeted by an aide and led into the large room. The moment he stepped in, the hologram turned on, and suddenly he was standing in a small senate. Adam walked into the middle and greeted the administrators. There were 42 of them sitting around, and they all had their own little fiefdom to rule over. Not all were humans, either; he had Wossir, Tufons, Harans, Bylgons, and even Rigallos. He introduced his sons and had some chairs brought forward for them, as the meeting started. Mostly, it was trade and budget disputes.¬† But today there were two more important matters.

‚ÄúI hate to bring it up, Sir, but your donors are at it again. They are claiming the free speech to have Kun-Nar‚Äôs speech spread through them. This time it was used to activate his fanatics on Halden Prime; they detonated inside a temple, and thirty-seven died. That‚Äôs the sixth attack they have triggered by those speeches.‚Äù Cal-Hok, the administrator of the Halden system, said, and Adam saw the others were just as frustrated about it.

‚ÄúI understand that you want to just invade that sorry excuse of a colony and take it over. And yes, we are still looking for that idiot Kun-Nar. ¬†But taking over Xanadu by military force will trigger worry among the other kingdoms in the sector. We can't do it, and those bastards are smart enough not to attack others.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúSo, we just take it? We allow them to spread that nonsense?‚Äù Ytun Vel Korn said she was clearly frustrated, too.

‚ÄúNo, the shadows are working hard on finding a solution. But I got Earth's government on my ass, warning me about just killing them. That said, we don‚Äôt need to make it easy for them. The boycott is still in effect, and the negative ads as well. If they want to play that game, then we can too.¬† I will bring it up with the federation as well, so I need all the intel on my desk before Friday to deal with this. And pay for the funerals.¬† It has gone too far, and I will take it up in the council tomorrow.‚Äù Adam said, and they calmed down a bit. He had picked the men and women who dared to speak up against him to be his administrators. His kingdom was getting too big to rule by himself.

Mario Navil was the next to speak up, ‚ÄúSir, we have received an applicant to join your kingdom from a failed colony near the Argus system. It‚Äôs a Scisya colony. They have all the documents in order, they only need your approval.‚Äù

Adam looked at them. ‚ÄúAnd you have all looked over and added your view on the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe vote is 42 for. Zero against. ¬†The system has great potential, but they do not have the resources to take advantage of it.‚Äù Mario replied, and they all knew what Adam would suggest, so Mario continued before Adam could counter. ‚ÄúAnd they do not want a loan or aid. They also protect themselves from other kingdoms that want to swallow them up. I have sent one ship to protect from raiders as well, at their request.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the hell don‚Äôt they don‚Äôt want aid?‚Äù Adam sight. It was the damn Scisya belief. He needed to go to their kingdom soon and have a serious discussion with their pope.

‚ÄúI will take this up with the council as well. If they agree, we can include them. Now, can we get back to business? We have seven other matters to discuss.‚Äù He replied, and they agreed to move on. The other matters were more boring, administrative business about where to build new gates and station waypoints. He glanced over at his boys, who seemed to take it all in. Chris had a serious look on his face as he listened, and he knew he would be hounded by questions afterward. ¬†

When the meeting finished, he took them to the terrace for snacks as they both started to ask him about all the things they had wondered about. Sam had recorded it all on his little pad.¬† But today had been a good day, his boys were getting bigger.

On sunday I had a date with a girl from Bumble. It was fun, we had coffee + cake, went for a walk and had a drink to close things off. 
After I came home I texted her how I enjoyed meeting her and that I would like to take her on a second date for billiards and beer (something we talked about during the date). Though I didn‚Äòt set a day and time yet, as to not ""pressure"" her.
She said yes, that she had a lot of fun and that I was very cute.  
I‚Äòve replied with a nicety and kept it at that.  

Since sunday evening we haven‚Äòt texted any further.  
So my question for you is:  
Should I break the silence? If yes, how? I thought about snapping a pic of what I‚Äòm doing this afternoon (Golf, which she asked me a lot of questions about) and just casually ask how her week is going.

""actually, it works!""","Initial thoughts of Horizons were Wow, this is great! I built a fully functioning multi-tenant (with sub-teams) system to gather reports, complete with analytical data calculations, and a tracker. 

Other than basic coding knowledge/hobbyist-level stuff, I had no prior experience.  
  
**Attempt 1:**  
Several prompts later, I had my app. It worked flawlessly using local storage for data. I was blown away by the creation of less than 6 hours! I was way too excited. An idea I had 5 years ago, I finally got around to doing something about it.  
Then came the time to connect it over to Supabase, oh boy, what a disaster. Nothing worked, tables weren't created correctly, I wasted sooooo many credits getting it to fix an authentication issue despite repeated messages ""I'll remove ALL traces of the old auth method""... 20 credits later, the old auth data was still there.

I scraped it.

  
**Attempt 2:**  
I created the first prompt, then I connected to SupaBase. I thought if I connected early, there would be no issues with the table /databases. Also wrong. It really struggled doing things in a logical way. This time, though, I learnt my lesson. I didn't waste credits on trying to fix it.

**Attempt 3:**  
A different approach! I detailed to Gemini what my project was, providing screenshots. Explained how I was building it, the previous issues, and asked what the best methods were. Without wanting to make the same mistakes, I asked Gemini to hold my hand every step of the way to make sure I was doing things right.

Gemini helped me create the tables, foreign keys & policies manually before entering a single word into Horizons (it did offer to provide detailed prompts for Horizons to do this; I chose the manual way).  
Gemini then suggested I simply ask Horizons to create a login screen. That was it. After this, we would connect to SupaBase and test the authentication. It worked.

Each step after this, Gemini provided detailed prompts (which were edited), including telling horizons when to \[insert\] \[delete\] \[update\] database tables, etc. Very specific. Treating Horizons as a dummy, telling it exactly where to look and fetch information from.

**The result:**  
A fully functioning, working web-app that is almost ready to showcase. An app that would have cost thousands and thousands, cost a few grey hairs, some cursing, and a few coffees.

**Other thoughts:**

* Horizons can handle more than a small prompt despite the helpful tooltip. At times, my prompts were hundreds of words. They were very detailed, though.
* Why can't Horizons use Hostinger's own database, then copy these across to Supabase for easier integration? 
* There is no way to upload previous code to a new project, even if built with Horizons.
* **USE AI TO HELP AI** \- Honestly, I think this saved me, especially with the prompts telling Horizons exactly what tables to connect features to.
* Credit Errors: Some errors I understand... but repeatedly telling me it removed some code, but not really, annoyed the shit out of me. This needs fixing. There needs to be a way to see all previous errors and be compensated for them.
* Build section by section. Sure, build the initial layout of a whole page, telling it ""this is where XYZ will go and its features, but make this a placeholder right now"". This method gives good results.

* **Biggest TIP:** Create a blank project, describe your idea to Horizons, let it try and build everything. Even if it doesn't work as intended. Take screenshots of every page and every section. Rename these screenshots to the page/feature they apply to. Feed these into Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini. Now create a new project (so no old, hidden code is hanging around), and begin with the prompts. Create the tables manually first, if required. When adding the prompt for the page/section to Horizons, add the matching screenshot.

  
Horizons is a great tool, while frustrating at times, as with everything, the boring step-by-step pre-planning really helps Horizon succeed. Seeing what it has created, my brain is now flowing with new uses. ",1,1754470310.0,Hostinger,0,1.0,False

I let it soak overnight. Then I brought it to just below the boil a few times over the next few days. On the morning that I was going to drink it, I simmered the seeds for about 20-30 minutes. The liquid was fluorescent yellow. It tasted like bad quality very bitter coffee. I added some sugar.  I drank the brew and also chewed and ate the seeds which had swollen up to about quadruple their original size.  About 15 minutes after a drank this, I took a half dose of magic mushrooms.

I experienced a very extreme, very very dark trip with vivid open eye hallucinations. I re-entered scenes from my early childhood and did deep psychological work. It was extremely dark. It felt like the Syrian Rue was a demon zipping around in my blood - around and around.  For the first 5 hours, my body shook constantly, my heart rate was elevated, I had sweats and chills, I vomited violently and then continued to have nausea.  I could not keep down water, I had roaring in my ears. My vision was very blurry when I tried to walk and I was extremely dizzy and wobbly on my feet. I became concerned that I might be medically at risk.  With great reluctance, I called for an ambulance and spent the next 14 hours tripping in the ER. They just gave me fluids through IV as well as anti-nausea meds.  I was still hallucinating 18 hours after I took my dose at which point I asked for a benzo to kill the trip but they refused to give me one since they said I was calm.

I did not eat while I was there and continued to fast until the next evening when I became hungry. I had some oats with plain 100% pea protein powder and some cherries cooked into porridge. In the night and into today, I have liquid diarrhoea. I am not sure how to look after myself in terms of diet. Any advice appreciated.

I think part of why my body had such a difficult time is because I have been eating a diet high in tyramine and even the breakfast I ate the morning that I tripped was high in tyramine. I will have to be much more careful with diet if I trip again using SR.  I will also take less next time and I won‚Äôt eat the seeds - I‚Äôll just drink the brew.  

To be honest, I‚Äôm not sure I even felt the mushrooms because the rue dominated so much. My pupils were not dilated like they usually would be on mushrooms.

I am having a difficult time trying to come up with gift ideas for my long-distance (48M) boyfriend. The last couple of times I've given him anything, they were in-game items/packs that he specifically mentioned in the past, or I baked and shipped him his favorite flavor of cookies. Both of these things are fine, but I was hoping to find something a little more tangible, and long-lasting.

Most of the stuff I have found online is either like ""Get him an axe-shaped candle that is scented like man-beef dipped in whiskey sweat,"" or very basic ""wallet, watch, socks.""

A little about him: He has a military background and a wide variety of interests. He's a big nerd (Batman, StarWars, Warhammer 40k, etc.), is a bit of a history buff, is incredibly creative (music, art, video editing, etc.), loves gaming, cooking, horror, animals (especially Snow Leopards and Rats), Scotland, alcohol, coffee, etc. He also knows several languages. He also would never admit it to anyone else, but he's a big romantic, and super sweet.

He's also a bit of a collector, so it's hard to find anything valuable that he doesn't already have when it comes to some of his nerdier interests.

I'm open to any ideas, but practical gifts are nice, he likes things he can use often (but I don't know what sorts of things that might be other than like.. a wallet or a coffee mug or something? Would a man actually like that as a gift??), and preferably something sturdy, because he's a little anxious over the idea of accidentally losing or breaking the things he's given.

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mediocrity**  
The San Francisco Giants (-155) are slight favorites over the Pittsburgh Pirates (+129), implying bookmakers give the Giants a 61.2% chance to win and the Pirates a 43.8% chance. While these numbers suggest a toss-up, context reveals the Giants‚Äô edge. The Giants have a 50.7% winning percentage as favorites, outperforming the Pirates‚Äô 42.9% as underdogs. Statistically, this matchup is like a race between a sloth on Red Bull and a sloth on coffee‚Äîboth are slow, but one‚Äôs *slightly* less doomed.

Offensively, the Giants average 4.2 runs per game, while the Pirates scrape by with 3.6. That 0.6-run gap feels like the difference between a microwave and a campfire: one heats your meal, the other chars it. Defensively, the Giants‚Äô 22nd-ranked scoring offense isn‚Äôt exactly a dynasty, but it‚Äôs enough to outpace the Pirates, who look like they‚Äôre batting in a hurricane.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Comebacks, and One Very Trippy Shoelace**  
While no major injuries are listed, let‚Äôs extrapolate from the data like a sportswriter with a wild imagination:

* **Robbie Ray** (Giants‚Äô starter) is ‚Äúhealthy,‚Äù which in MLB code means he won‚Äôt throw 100 mph but will probably throw a knuckleball at a critical moment.
* **Andrew Heaney** (Pirates‚Äô starter) has a 50% chance of becoming a meme by the 6th inning. Last time he pitched, a pigeon landed on his cap and he struck out the side‚Äî*with the cap*.
* The Pirates‚Äô **Isiah Kiner-Falefa** is ‚Äúmotivated‚Äù after driving in the winning run last game. Translation: He‚Äôll swing at anything, including a wild pitch, a dirt clod, and possibly a bird.
* The Giants‚Äô **Jung Hoo Lee** is ‚Äúlocked in,‚Äù which means he‚Äôll either h

Hi just need some advice on how to approach a situation with a friend that I‚Äôve known for a long time but hasn‚Äôt been returning messages. I usually see my psychologist for advice but I‚Äôve been super poor recently due to chronic headaches (love healthcare)

I (24F) have a friend (25F) I‚Äôll call Anna that I have known since high school, we were close during school but we have slowly drifted apart (typical life things). I have organised coffee dates over the last couple of years but recently has not been returning my messages and leaving me on delivered, this is somewhat normal as she has does take some time to respond to messages but this has recently been months instead of days without returning messages. I have messaged twice since mid May; once for general chit chat and the other to organise another coffee get together both with no reply, I also know she‚Äôs online as it shows on the profile.

About a year ago, I had a fall out with a mutual friend we share (24F) I‚Äôll call Brittany, that I was living with at the time. We all went to the same high school and all have similar relationship with each other. The fall out was due to Brittany being very controlling and emotionally abusive towards me which lead to me being verbally assaulted and physically intimidated in my home. This lead me to place an emergency domestic violence clause to break the lease for as she was not allowing me and my other roommate to leave + a police report was filed due to refusing to break the lease then decided to moved back to the town (30min away) that I was living in after I had moved out.

My worry is that Brittany has gone to Anna and has talked negatively about me to the point that Anna has chosen her side and decided to not talk to me anymore. One of the big reasons I didn‚Äôt want to talk about that incident with Anna is because I didn‚Äôt want her to think negatively of me or to think I am going around talking shit on someone with no means of them defending themselves as wel as Brittany being her friend for just as long as I have. Post the incident I did have coffee with Anna at the start of the year approx 6 months post incident. She never mentioned it and I didn‚Äôt discuss it at all, mostly because I still get really nervous and stressed talking about it, I have barely told anyone about the incident. For all I know she didn‚Äôt know that it has happened. 

I know that there is a (high) chance that this is all in my head and maybe Brittany hasn‚Äôt talked to Anna about me and that she could be really busy, she is planning on getting married in the near future. But I‚Äôm very worried that my relationship with my friend has changed drastically and I cannot put my finger on why.

Does anyone have any advice of how to approach the situation. I want to discuss this with her but I am worried I could come across the wrong way. Thank you x",1,1754469204.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

We (except husband) are all sick at the moment. My son is on the way of recovery and wanted to go outside. Since the baby is still sick, I asked my mother to please just watch him for an hour in our yard, so that he gets some fresh air, but if he starts to get worse, he could just come back inside.

My mother lives next door, comes over, plays with kid outside. While I am inside with the baby, my mother gets called over by two men from the electricity company. She takes my son with her, doesn't tell me. They offer her a cheaper contract. She signs it without reading and gives them her IBAN. Makes them even coffee. She calles me to tell me they were coming to my place, too. I told her absolutely not.

I call the company, the numbers on the card are not in their system, only the name of the worker is correct. I call the worker. Doesnt pick up, doesnt call back.
I call the police, her bank, etc. I got the baby and rushed over there to get my son home. I screamed at her, how stupid it is, to let someone in her home without a heads up, to sign without reading. That they could have robbed or killed her and kidnap my son. I told her, I can't trust her with my kids anymore.

I got a call from the police today... It was probably a new subcontractor and no scam. I am relieved but don't know, how to handle the situation.

I am still so pissed, how she overstepped my boundaries and potentially put my son in danger.

May 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.¬†

Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.¬†

The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.¬†

I clutched the file in my hands, forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn‚Äôt glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.¬†

‚ÄúAre you busy?‚Äù I asked, my voice even, polite.¬†

He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.¬†

‚ÄúA bit,‚Äù he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.¬†

‚ÄúJust a few spots to sign.‚Äù¬†

Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.¬†

I watched silently. Ethan looked‚Ä¶ worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows un- der them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference ‚Äì a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.¬†

But he hadn‚Äôt come back alone.¬†

My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me. ‚ÄòHe reeks of her.‚Äô I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.¬†

When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.¬†

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.¬†

I paused, hesitated, then asked, ‚ÄúWill you be home for dinner tonight?‚Äù¬†

Predictably, Ethan shook his head. ‚ÄúGot some things to wrap up here. Don‚Äôt wait.‚Äù¬†

I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. ‚ÄúGot it. See you around, Alpha,‚Äù I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule-not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted¬†

claiming.‚Äù¬†

I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.¬†

My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door. The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.¬†

‚ÄòSmell.‚ÄôSweet vanilla perfume ‚Äì too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.¬†

Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.¬†

Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise. He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.‚Äô¬†

My throat tightened painfully.¬†

My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.¬†

By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.¬†

Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer-the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.¬†

My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.¬†

Firm. Bold. Unwavering.¬†

Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.¬†

That familiar scent I sniffed earlier-I knew exactly who it belonged to. I‚Äôm smarter than this. I should‚Äôve seen it coming.¬†

I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.¬†

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan‚Äôs mother Amelia‚Äôs voice again- calm, cold, and cutting. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be naive, Olivia. Men‚Äîeven Alphas-always want more. They don‚Äôt stay faithful.‚Äù¬†

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. ‚ÄúYou were always spot on, Amelia,‚Äù I muttered.¬†

I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.¬†

Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.¬†

‚ÄòWe deserve better‚Äô, Yve whispered.¬†

‚ÄòWe do‚Äô, I agreed.¬†

The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private. If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my per- sonal accounts.¬†

In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack‚Äôs standing ‚Äì something Amelia would never allow.¬†

Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spec-¬†

I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That‚Äôs when a knock came at the door.¬†

‚ÄúCome in,‚Äù I said.¬†

Ethan‚Äôs beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.¬†

Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.¬†

Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set ‚Äì necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo‚Ä¶on her.¬†

Disgust crawled up my throat.¬†

‚ÄúAlpha Ethan mentioned he‚Ä¶ he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.‚Äù Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.¬†

I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.¬†

‚ÄúHow thoughtful of him,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven with his busy schedule and all‚Äù I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.¬†

Reed flinched slightly. ‚ÄúI should get back,‚Äù He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a¬†

## Key Features Analysis

the performance of a paper towel hinges on several key characteristics. Absorbency, strength (both wet and dry), texture, and environmental impact all play crucial roles in determining its suitability for various tasks. let's examine these features in detail:

**Absorbency:** A highly absorbent paper towel can soak up spills quickly and efficiently,reducing the amount needed for each task.

Absorbency refers to the amount of liquid a paper towel can hold. This is steadfast by the fiber content and the construction of the paper.Higher quality paper towels feature more densely packed fibers, creating a larger surface area for liquid absorption. Some brands also incorporate embossed patterns that create pockets for liquid to pool in, further boosting absorbency. Paper towels with superior absorbency excel at tackling large spills and reducing waste,making them a cost-effective choice in the long run.

**Strength (Wet and Dry):** A durable paper towel resists tearing and disintegration, especially when wet, ensuring it can handle tough cleaning jobs without falling apart.

Dry strength is crucial for tasks like wiping up crumbs or dusting surfaces, while wet strength is essential for soaking up spills and cleaning grime. Wet strength is particularly crucial as paper towels are frequently enough used in wet or damp conditions, and a weak paper towel can quickly disintegrate, leaving behind paper residue and requiring more towels to complete the task. Manufacturers often add strengthening agents to the paper during the manufacturing process to enhance wet strength.

**Texture:** The surface texture of a paper towel affects its ability to scrub surfaces clean and remove stubborn dirt.

Texture plays a vital role in certain cleaning applications. Some paper towels feature a slightly rough or textured surface, which provides enhanced scrubbing power for removing stubborn stains and grime from surfaces. Others have a smoother texture, which is gentler on delicate surfaces and ideal for wiping down mirrors and glass without leaving streaks. The ideal texture for a paper towel ultimately depends on the specific tasks for which it will be primarily used.

**Environmental Impact:** Sustainable paper towels made from recycled materials or sustainably sourced fibers minimize their environmental footprint.

The environmental impact of paper towel production and disposal is an increasing concern for many consumers. Sustainable paper towels are typically made from recycled paper or fibers sourced from responsibly managed forests. These options help reduce deforestation and minimize the use of virgin resources. Some brands also offer compostable paper towels, which can be broken down in home or commercial composting systems, further reducing their environmental impact. Choosing eco-pleasant paper towels demonstrates a commitment to sustainability and responsible consumption.

**Perforations:** Easily tearable, consistently spaced perforations prevent tearing of adjacent sheets.

The quality of perforations allows the user to tear off desired sheet amounts. Poor perforations lead to wasted paper towels and user frustration. Well-defined perforations allow for single hand tearing, which also reduces contamination in the kitchen or workspace.

**Dispensing Method:** roll size and dispenser compatibility contribute to convenient and economical use.

There are many dispensing methods, including select-a-size, standard rolls, and industrial-sized rolls for dispensers. Smaller households may opt for select-a-size or standard rolls, whereas commercial kitchens and businesses will want industrial-sized rolls to reduce the frequency of roll replacement.

## Core benefits

The benefits of using high-quality paper towels extend beyond simple cleaning tasks. They offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, convenience, and overall cost-effectiveness.

**Improved Cleaning Efficiency:** High-quality paper towels with superior absorbency and strength allow for quicker and more effective cleanup. Users report using fewer towels per spill compared to cheaper alternatives,which translates to less time spent cleaning and reduced waste. This efficiency is particularly valuable in busy households or commercial settings were time is of the essence.

**Enhanced Hygiene:** paper towels provide a hygienic option to reusable cloths, especially in situations requiring immediate cleanup of potentially contaminated spills. Using a fresh paper towel for each task minimizes the risk of cross-contamination and helps maintain a cleaner and healthier habitat. this is especially critically important in kitchens, bathrooms, and healthcare settings where hygiene is paramount.

**cost-Effectiveness Over Time:** While premium paper towels may have a higher initial cost,their superior absorbency and strength mean fewer towels are needed per use. This results in lower overall consumption and reduced spending on paper towels in the long run. Furthermore, durable paper towels are less likely to tear or disintegrate during use, preventing costly messes and reducing the need for frequent replacements.

**Greater Convenience:** Paper towels offer unparalleled convenience for a wide range of tasks, from wiping countertops to drying hands. Their disposable nature eliminates the need for laundering and ensures a readily available cleaning solution whenever and wherever it's needed. this convenience is especially appreciated during busy times or when traveling.

## FAQs Section

**Are all paper towels septic safe?**
No, not all paper towels are septic safe. It's crucial to check the packaging for specific claims about septic system compatibility. Paper towels that are not designed to break down easily can clog septic systems over time.Look for brands that explicitly state they are septic-safe or made from biodegradable materials.

**What are the benefits of using bamboo paper towels?**
Bamboo paper towels are often touted as a more sustainable alternative to conventional paper towels. Bamboo is a fast-growing, renewable resource that requires less water and pesticides than trees.Bamboo paper towels are also typically stronger and more absorbent than conventional paper towels, reducing the amount needed per use.

**How can I store paper towels to keep them fresh?**
Store paper towels in a dry, cool place away from direct sunlight and moisture. Excessive humidity can cause paper towels to become damp and lose some of their absorbency. If you live in a particularly humid climate, consider storing paper towels in an airtight container to protect them from moisture.

**What are some alternative uses for paper towels besides cleaning?**
Paper towels have several alternative uses beyond cleaning. They can be used to line refrigerator drawers to absorb moisture and keep produce fresh, to blot excess oil from fried foods, to wrap delicate items for storage or moving, and even as temporary filters for coffee or tea.

They're nice people. There are no outward issues that you typically find in this Reddit page - no rows, no resentment, no barbed comments (at least not that I can recognise) - I just don't seem to be able to converse with them. It never feels totally natural. I never feel completely comfortable revealing all of my personality. It's for this reason that I worry I come off as a bit of a drip! 

Part of the issue is that we very rarely go anywhere and do anything apart from sit in the house and talk. This is because one of my in-laws is unwell (but they still lead a very full social life and are not house-bound in any sense), and they're not particularly well-off - of course, I have no issue at all with the amount of money they have, but I think perhaps I have never known them in too many other contexts, and perhaps they have never known me in many other contexts. I've met the parents of my friends and got on with them really well, really quickly. It felt free and easy and responsive from the outset. We yapped about everything from books and music to ideas and whimsy. I can imagine going for a coffee, round a gallery, etc, with them on my own but not sure I could with my in-laws. It feels like we never progressed beyond those first couple of awkward meetings. I honestly don't know why.

Perhaps I am the problem here, but I feel like our conversational styles don't gel. A lot of the time I feel like I'm being talked at rather than conversed with. (FYI I also have a half-similar with my partner's sibling). A lot of the times there are just closed questions. Anyway - if you have ideas, reassurance, (constructive!) criticism then it would be very much appreciated. Have you had a similar issue? Perhaps what I'm asking for most is advice. I need to be better (even though I seem to have effortlessly normal conversations and interactions with pretty much every other person I meet!). ",2,1754468596.0,inlaws,1,1.0,False

I am having a difficult time trying to come up with gift ideas for my long-distance (48M) boyfriend. The last couple of times I've given him anything, they were in-game items/packs that he specifically mentioned in the past, or I baked and shipped him his favorite flavor of cookies. Both of these things are fine, but I was hoping to find something a little more tangible, and long-lasting.

Most of the stuff I have found online is either like ""Get him an axe-shaped candle that is scented like man-beef dipped in whiskey sweat,"" or very basic ""wallet, watch, socks.""

A little about him: He has a military background and a wide variety of interests. He's a big nerd (Batman, StarWars, Warhammer 40k, etc.), is a bit of a history buff, is incredibly creative (music, art, video editing, etc.), loves gaming, cooking, horror, animals (especially Snow Leopards and Rats), Scotland, alcohol, coffee, etc. He also knows several languages. He also would never admit it to anyone else, but he's a big romantic, and super sweet.

He's also a bit of a collector, so it's hard to find anything valuable that he doesn't already have when it comes to some of his nerdier interests.

I'm open to any ideas, but practical gifts are nice, he likes things he can use often (but I don't know what sorts of things that might be other than like.. a wallet or a coffee mug or something? Would a man actually like that as a gift??), and preferably something sturdy, because he's a little anxious over the idea of accidentally losing or breaking the things he's given.

She Refused His Black Card, So I Took It
üëâ CONTINUE READING üëà
Chapter 1
„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe sweet scholarship girl slapped away the black card in the rich prince‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt insult me with your dirty money!‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄEven poorer than she was, I bent down, picked up the card from the dust, and handed it back to Nathan Whitmore with trembling hands.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan sized me up and said, ‚ÄúIf Victoria takes the card, I‚Äôll sponsor you both.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfraid I might actually keep it, Victoria Sterling snatched the card from my grasp.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAnd just like that, both of us fell under the Whitmore family‚Äôs patronage.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe difference is that I groveled at Nathan‚Äôs feet for his scraps.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria? He groveled to shower her with his wealth.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄYears later, Victoria went abroad for further studies, while I started working.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThen Nathan pulled me into his bed and took my V-card.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe made me her stand-in.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat is, until Victoria came back.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe said, ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äôs uncomfortable with the fact that we‚Äôve... been together.. Go get yourself a boyfriend.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI said, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ...

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNo one knew Victoria returned early that day.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan had kept me in his bed until late that night, his hands on my skin, his breath against my neck. I fell asleep in his arms, completely drained.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAt dawn, he got a message, shot upright in bed, and yanked the covers off me.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe sudden rush of cold air hit my bare skin. I shivered, still half-asleep. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù I mumbled.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äôs back. Get up and clean this place. Erase every trace of you from this room before she sees anything. Hurry up.‚Äù He spoke as he rushed to put on his pants.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI jolted fully awake and sat up, looking down at the bruises and marks all over my bare body.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI looked like some dirty mistress sneaking around‚Äîwhen in fact, they weren‚Äôt even officially together.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúHurry up. I‚Äôm going to pick her up. Be gone by the time we‚Äôre back.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe slipped on his watch and stormed out without another glance.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI tidied up the apartment for him as best I could and quietly left.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNot long after, I got a call from Nathan.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äôs back, and she‚Äôs been craving your cooking. Can you come over and make dinner?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI paused for a second. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sure.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I returned to Nathan‚Äôs place, it was the housekeeper who opened the door.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria was lounging on the couch in stylish loungewear, looking every bit the elegant beauty.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMadison, wow‚Äîit‚Äôs been ages. You haven‚Äôt changed a bit,‚Äù she greeted me lazily.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI smiled and nodded. ‚ÄúYou look even more stunning now.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan came out. ‚ÄúMadison, go get started on dinner. Victoria‚Äôs probably starving.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria scooted over on the couch to make space for him, patting the cushion beside her with a grin.„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed Madison‚Äôs cooking so much while I was overseas. Finally, I get to eat it again.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan teased her, ‚ÄúI told you to come back sooner‚Äîyou could‚Äôve had it every day.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúUgh, I was trying to focus on grad school. You were always such a distraction.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey laughed and bantered as I busied myself in the kitchen, just like I‚Äôd done countless times before‚Äîpreparing a meal for them.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter dinner, Victoria went upstairs to rest. Nathan had always kept her room ready, right next to his.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn her way up, she turned and asked, ‚ÄúIs my room still the one upstairs next to yours? And Madison‚Äôs‚Ä¶ still the servant‚Äôs quarters downstairs?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Though I actually have my own place now.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter a few days of cooking for them, I was about to leave when Nathan stopped me.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúVictoria knows we used to sleep together. She‚Äôs not exactly thrilled about it.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMadison, you should get a boyfriend. It‚Äôll put her mind at ease.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI froze for a moment before replying, ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ

Chapter 2
„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria had just joined Orion Group, one of the key subsidiaries of Whitmore Corp., overseen by Nathan himself.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe position I had fought tooth and nail for‚ÄîAssistant Director of the Planning Department‚Äîwas instantly overshadowed. Victoria parachuted in as Director, becoming my immediate superior.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI brought a few team members to her office to go over some procedures.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄShe skimmed through a few files, then suddenly looked up at me and said, „ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMadison, go make me a cup of coffee, will you?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe others glanced over, visibly stunned.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThey were clearly wondering‚Äîwhy was the newly appointed Director asking the Assistant Director to fetch coffee instead of her assistant?

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI simply nodded. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBecause I always knew exactly where I stood in this whole sponsorship story.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI was the extra, the tagalong. The one walking behind them, running their errands like some glorified gofer.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄEven though we were all grown up now, Victoria‚Äôs attitude toward me hadn‚Äôt changed one bit. And honestly? I‚Äôd gotten used to it. These petty things didn‚Äôt bother me anymore.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat Friday, Nathan messaged me saying Victoria had just returned, and he wanted to get everyone together. Told me not to be late.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen I arrived at the private dining suite, I happened to catch a conversation going on inside.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúSo Nathan, you and Madison Carter really done for good?‚Äù one of his buddies was asking.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúWhat else would it be?‚Äù Nathan replied casually. ‚ÄúWatch your mouth. Just don‚Äôt bring it up in front of Victoria later, okay?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúDamn, Nathan‚Äôs still the same hopeless romantic,‚Äù another chimed in. ‚ÄúFrom high school to now, it‚Äôs always been Victoria. Madison was just a stand-in to keep the family off his back, a placeholder until Victoria came back.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúStill, Madison‚Äôs not bad either,‚Äù the first guy continued. ‚ÄúPretty face, polished demeanor. You‚Äôd never guess she used to be that shy, broke girl in school. She‚Äôs head over heels for you, man‚Äîdevoted as hell, does whatever you say. How‚Äôd you let that go?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan laughed. ‚ÄúWhat can I say? Victoria‚Äôs always been my moon. Madison‚Äôs sweet, sure, and she made the waiting easier.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúBut now that Victoria‚Äôs back, I need to tie up loose ends. Just waiting for her to officially say yes.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHis buddies chuckled, praising him for being such a devoted lover.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúMadison, why are you standing out here instead of going in?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe voice behind me made my heart freeze. „ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was Victoria.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ

Chapter 3
„ÄÄ„ÄÄEveryone in the room turned toward the door. When they saw me standing there, a flicker of awkwardness passed over their faces, a few of them even coughing to cover it up.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄEven Nathan looked slightly stiff‚Äîsomething rare for him. But when he saw my usual, unreadable expression and Victoria walking over to him, he quickly pulled himself together.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe kicked the buddy next to him to make space for Victoria.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI walked in too and quietly took a seat in the far corner.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAww, Madison, why‚Äôre you sitting so far away?‚Äù Victoria called out cheerfully. ‚ÄúCome sit here with us.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI smiled and shook my head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good. Here‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter the awkwardness faded, the room gradually warmed up again. People started playing party games.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria wasn‚Äôt very good‚Äîjust came back from abroad, after all‚Äîso she kept losing round after round. Nathan ended up drinking in her place.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSomeone laughed and said, ‚ÄúLast time someone got totally wasted and started acting wild‚Äîthank God Madison was there to‚Äî‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe sentence cut off midair. The mood shifted for a second before someone quickly changed the subject.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄOn my way back from the restroom, I heard voices near the emergency exit.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúUgh, seeing how chummy you and Madison sound when our friends talk about you guys‚Äîit just makes me uncomfortable,‚Äù Victoria‚Äôs voice was tinged with annoyance.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúCome on, Madison‚Äôs been around us for years. Of course we‚Äôre close,‚Äù Nathan replied.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúAnd if you‚Äôd just agree to be with me, what does it matter who else is around? Didn‚Äôt you hear the guys tonight? They were all hyping us up,‚Äù he added with a sigh.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúHmph. I still need time to evaluate you,‚Äù she said playfully.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI picked up my pace, walking past them as quietly as I could.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄLater, when I was walking down the hallway, Nathan called after me again.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs the whole ‚Äògetting a boyfriend‚Äô thing going?‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe sounded like he didn‚Äôt quite believe I was serious about it. There was a faint irritation in his eyes, like I was dragging my feet and messing with his dynamic with Victoria.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really trying,‚Äù I said softly. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll keep my distance from you two.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe looked at me for a moment, and something like guilt flickered in his expression.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶ just make sure the guy‚Äôs actually good for you,‚Äù he mumbled.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Chapter 4
„ÄÄ„ÄÄOver the weekend, I had dinner with Daniel Green.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWe met through a business collaboration‚Äîhe‚Äôs the marketing director at another firm. Tall, good-looking, and clearly interested in me.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAt first, I wasn‚Äôt really into it, but...

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI sighed inwardly and decided to give it a chance. I tried to stay engaged, made an effort to talk, to get to know him, to take it seriously.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄLittle by little, we got more familiar.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhen Victoria found out, she cornered me by the coffee station, eyes wide in mock surprise.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôve got yourself a boyfriend now? I thought you were so hung up on Nathan you couldn‚Äôt look at anyone else.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat one line made my face burn with shame.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI forced a smile. ‚ÄúThe past is the past. People move on.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria grinned. ‚ÄúWell, my birthday‚Äôs this weekend. Bring him along. I bet Nathan will be thrilled to see you‚Äôve finally moved on.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI nodded. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄ‚ãØ

„ÄÄ„ÄÄVictoria‚Äôs birthday bash was over-the-top. Nathan had clearly spent a fortune‚Äîeverything was extravagant, flawless, and very public.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄDaniel shook hands with Nathan, enthusiastically calling him ‚ÄúMr. Whitmore‚Äù with that eager look of someone trying to impress.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNathan gave him a once-over, then glanced at me. His expression was lukewarm at best.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter the main event, everyone moved outside to the riverside promenade to enjoy the fireworks Nathan had arranged for Victoria. He lit up the entire Ravenshill skyline just for her.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI watched them from a distance‚ÄîVictoria standing at the prime viewing spot, and Nathan by her side, his eyes filled with that soft, unwavering gaze.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe kind that said he'd move heaven and earth for her.„ÄÄ„ÄÄI looked at Nathan‚Äôs tall, imposing silhouette, and for a second, it reminded me of the bright, ambitious boy he once was.„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe boy who once said he‚Äôd sponsor me‚Äîand, with that one sentence, completely changed the trajectory of my life.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBack then, my gambling-addict father, Frank Carter, used to show up at my school over and over, dragging me around, demanding I drop out and marry some fifty-year-old limping widower to pay off his debts.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat day, Frank was beating me up in front of the school gates, yanking me away, and no one dared step in.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut Nathan did.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄHe said, ‚ÄúIf I said I‚Äôd sponsor you, then I‚Äôll protect you, too.‚Äù

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAfter that, it was Nathan who helped me cut ties with Frank for good.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIt was the Whitmore family‚Äôs support that got me through college and allowed me to attend the university I‚Äôd dreamed of.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThat‚Äôs when my life finally started to take on color.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄI knew I was just an add-on. I was there so Victoria would take the card, so someone could run errands, pass messages, tag along behind them.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄBut in my dreams, that boy who changed everything for me... he was still my moon.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄNow, as the fireworks lit up the night sky in dazzling bursts, I felt something quietly burn out inside me.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄSomething was fading‚Äîand I wasn‚Äôt sure I‚Äôd ever want it back.",1,1754468477.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Since a few days ago, it started to give me a problem during brewing, as coffee is leaking from both the brewing hole and another internal hole. When I make coffee, I get half coffee in the cup and half coffee inside the used capsule container. 

I leave a video to try to make you understand the problem, highlighting the incorrect exit hole.

Has this ever happened to you? Do you have any suggestions?",2,1754468263.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
