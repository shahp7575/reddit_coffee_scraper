1kjlf83,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeCry/comments/1kjlf83/my_grammie_my_person/,My Grammie. my person.,"A Tribute to Grammie

It was July of 2019. I don’t remember much about the day in question. I don’t remember what I was wearing, how my hair was parted—anything. All I remember were the memories:

The memories of how my grandmother, Grammie, would stay up late to watch *Cops*. She would wake up early to make coffee, watch the news, and never complain. I remember the gnomes she had in her case. The late nights watching *Expedition Unknown* and eating pierogies. She would treat a stranger to a greeting. And when it was time to leave, I would ask for one. More. Day. She always made room for the baseball games—professional and her grandchildren’s. Boy, did she love her Red Sox.

Things had gotten a little quieter since Pa passed six years ago. Remember how I said she got up early? Well, Pa beat her to it. He would have the news and coffee ready for her. And of course, he loved the Red Sox more than her. His last year alive, they won. They won the whole thing. Grammie got one more before… Life was good. I miss him more and more. I was 10—now 16—and wonder if he would like what I’ve done with my life. But my Grammie, she was fine. Calm. Hell, she got 46 years with the man, and I only got 10. I’m ashamed to say I was mad at God a little for that—not mad he’s gone, but the fact that He knew he was a good person and still took him. But don’t worry—we patched it up.

We were, Grammie and I, partners in crime. She’s the only person who knew I took my bike on a main road, and then proceeded to almost get hit by a car, driven by my uncle’s friend. I got to see her after that and remember our day—how I promised to never do that again. After all, it was only ONE. MORE. DAY.

Anyway, she made me happy. We went everywhere together. I’d push my mother out of the way to give her a hug. Nothing felt warmer than her embrace. I knew that the warm embrace would wash over me in her arms. Even after I got taller than her in 8th grade, I always felt like a little kid—like I was six or seven again, playing her Wii, dancing to *Just Dance*. I want ONE. MORE. DAY like that.

I can go on and on and on about everything I’ve ever heard from her, and everything we did. Sixteen years. That’s how long it took me to realize that she was the opposite of selfish. She loved everything and everyone, but most of all, she loved me. *Me.* Out of everyone in this world, I’m the one she chose to share life with. I just can’t believe it. I’m not famous. I’m not special. And at the end of the day—she chose me. I never forgot that.

I thought to myself on January 21 of that year, my birthday: “When I graduate, that’s when I show her how much I loved her. We’re going to Disney. We’ll see Mickey. Just us.” She has always loved Mickey. Her favorite movie was *Bambi*. The Epcot ride *Soarin’* was her favorite.

But then she got sick. A little head flu. Then one hospital stay, and then another—a little longer. Then another. Soon she wouldn’t be leaving, but my parents didn’t tell me that. I had never seen someone that sick. It was cancer. My grandpa passed from that too. And soon those feelings of an angry God were back.

Walking into her hospital room that May afternoon, all I did was cry. I cried for an hour silently. When I finally stopped, I realized it wasn’t an hour—it was three. The worst part was leaving. I don’t remember how I got home. But I did. And all I did was cry.

I was asked if I regret anything in my life. Yes. One thing. She was off the ventilator. I was able to talk to her. I got to talk to her once, but she had the tube down her throat and I could barely stomach words, so I wouldn’t really call it talking. I would more say she got to see me blubber and fumble through my words for the first time in my life. But the day she was off the ventilator, I went to my friend’s house for a summer party. My mother said she would want me to go because she would want me to have fun when the times were dark. “Don’t worry—you’ll get to talk to her tomorrow,” were my mother’s exact words.

I didn’t. She went back on the ventilator that night. And I only saw her open her eyes once more.

Then that day came. The day I knew—but buried in my head. They lied to me, knowing I wouldn’t have gone if I knew. “We’re just going in to see her again,” Dad said, knowing they already made a big decision.

We sat for a while, but knowing she could hear us made me wonder, *“I don’t want this… but does she? She doesn’t quit. Does she want this?”* And then the doctor came to deliver the six words I didn’t want to hear: “Are we ready to pull the plug?”

I sat there while I watched the only person that believed in me, loved me, trusted me—my Grammie—die. My great aunt sobbing her name. My uncle’s wife keeping it together, letting tears fall. And then there was me.

While dying, I swear—*I swear*—she summoned all the remaining strength and opened her eyes, and grabbed my hand. She LOOKED at me. *Me.* She looked at a boy, now a young man—the one who could never leave her house. The one who shared everything—more things than my mom knows and will never know. The one who… she chose to look at. As if to say, *“I know, honey. Don’t worry. It will all be okay. I love you.”* Then she closed them.

That was the last time I saw her beautiful green eyes.

Another hour went by, and it was time to go. I gave her one more hug. The feel of that warm embrace—it was gone. Nothing was left. All the moments were now memories. It was cold. I remember thinking, *“She’s cold—we have to get her a blanket.”* Then I remembered.

That’s when I broke. I dropped—sobbing. That embrace that made me smile and feel comfort—it was gone. My family picked me up and hugged me. As I was leaving, I bear-hugged her and said, “Please don’t go. Please don’t go,” begging for ONE. MORE. DAY.

Now, officially, everything was in the past.

We went to dinner. Well—they did. I didn’t eat for a while. While being abashedly angry again, I thanked God it was the summer. I would not have finished school if I had to go. I also thanked God for letting her go peacefully and not in pain. Leaving me in pain? Well, that’s something we have to patch up again. (We have.)

This year marks six years. Twelve since Pa died, and six since Grammie. I have a tradition, taken from *Stella Crater* (great read): order two drinks—one for me and one for Grammie. Drink mine. And when I finish, raise the glass into the air and say, “I love you, Grammie, wherever you are.” And leave the other full glass for her in the afterlife.

Good luck, Grammie—wherever you are.

—Your loving grandson, Cam

**P.S.** When I see you again, you better have those pierogies ready. The trip up there must have made you hungry. And I promise you, I will never, ever forget what you told me. It’s our little secret.

Thank you. And if you’re still lucky enough to have your grandparents, give them a call and tell them you love them. Because one day—you won’t be able to.",2,1746914121.0,MadeMeCry,1,1.0,False

1kjl8rm,https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/toronto-hippies-campaign-street-closure-canada-1967,TIL: Toronto hippies in the 60s tried to make Yorkville a pedestrian street,"In 1967 Yorkville Village, Toronto was a neighborhood inhabited by many aspiring artists, hippies, greasers, bikers, youth, and others looking to embrace the counter culture lifestyle.  This lifestyle attracted many youth who travelled from all across Canada to experience the environment Yorkville offered.  Due to the influx of youth to Yorkville during this time, many of whom were poor and actively avoided the mainstream idea of working for money, several resident hippies formed a community activist group called The Diggers (taking their name from a similar group in San Francisco and historically modeled on the 17th century Diggers, a group of Protestant English agrarian communists).  The Diggers, lead by David DePoe, took care of Yorkville’s youth living on the streets by providing them with food and shelter. 

Many of the young residents and hippies who inhabited Yorkville Village (a triangle of approximately 25 city blocks) were viewed to be no more than drug addicts and vagrants by many of the middle-aged and upper and middle class residents of Toronto and by City and government institutions. Thus, in an effort to turn around public opinion, the Diggers held a Love-in at Queen’s Park on 22 May 1967.  The peaceful event attracted over 5,000 people.  There were performances by the likes of Leonard Cohen and Buffy Sainte-Marie, dancing, and the formation of a human chain in an effort to link the young and old generations together.  In this way the hippies were using the nonviolent method of establishing a new social pattern.

After the Love-in, Yorkville became even more of a public spectacle. Needless to say, this soon created traffic gridlock on the already congested, two-block, one way street of Yorkville Avenue.  It also posed a danger for pedestrian foot traffic.

To the Diggers the solution was simple, close Yorkville Avenue to vehicle traffic and turn it into a pedestrian mall.  Yorkville Avenue was already a parade of coffee shops and boutiques with a high volume of foot traffic.  David DePoe took the idea to the then City of Toronto Controller and former Mayor, Allan Lamport.  Allan Lamport, along with the city’s Planning Commissioner, Matthew Lawson opposed the idea.  However, Allan Lamport invited the Diggers to a Talk-in with Toronto City Council on 17 August 1967. Fifty-eight hippies attended the Talk-in.  David DePoe did a poor job in leading the discussions which quickly lost the objective of discussing the closure of Yorkville Avenue to antagonizing the counter culture lifestyle of the Yorkville hippie residents by Allan Lamport. 

In response to this, on 20 August 1967, the Diggers, again lead by David DePoe, staged a sit-in on Yorkville Avenue.  At 3:00 a.m., 300 Yorkville Residents walked into the middle of the street and sat down, blocking all traffic. Approximately another 2,500 people stood and watched, creating an even greater traffic disruption.  The demonstration was peaceful, however 50 people were arrested for refusing to move when police tried to break-up the protest. David DePoe was among those arrested and was charged with creating a disturbance and obstructing traffic. 

Following the sit-in, those who had not been arrested gathered in Queen's Park to regroup and discuss their next move. A spontaneous Love-in broke out in Queen’s Park the next day following the release of David DePoe and others from jail.

Pressing on, the Diggers organized their next protest. On 23 August 1967 more than 150 hippies conducted a sleep-in in front of City Hall. They had hoped to greet Mayor William Dennison and confront him on the issue of the Yorkville Avenue closure.  They did not get an opportunity to have that discussion with the Mayor. 

It is unclear as to when exactly the campaign ended.  City Hall refused to seriously consider the proposed street closure and the street was never closed to vehicular traffic.",3,1746913620.0,toronto,0,0.8,False

Just wanted to echo what so many others have said: **DO NOT trust how you feel after the exam.** I walked out in complete shock, couldn’t talk to anyone for at least an hour. It didn’t feel *crazy* hard, but I got hit with unexpected topics that really threw me off. I genuinely thought I failed and spent two stressful weeks spiraling—thankfully I had a trip planned to distract me.

When I opened my score report, I still **passed**.

**So please, trust your NBMEs and Free 120. They really are the best predictors.**

# My Scores

* **CBSE 1 (2/18)** – 55
* **NBME 28 (3/4)** – 60
* **CBSE 2 (3/18)** – 65
* **NBME 29 (4/1)** – 71
* **NBME 30 (4/8)** – 76
* **NBME 31 (4/15)** – 71
* **Free 120 (4/19)** – 75
* **Step 1 (4/24)** –  Passed

# Timeline & Resources

* **Dedicated started in February (9 weeks total)**
* This pace worked for me—busy but had daily downtime
* Resources I used:
   * **UWorld** – 53% complete, 65% avg
   * **Pathoma** – watched all videos after CBSE 2
   * **Sketchy** – rewatched all Micro + Pharm
   * **Anki** – UWorld miss cards daily, Pathoma/Sketchy deck when I had time

# Study Details

* **UWorld strategy:**
   * Started by systems → switched to random in March
   * Timed mode began \~1 month before the exam (wish I’d started sooner)
   * Focused on understanding missed Qs + suspending relevant Anki cards
* **Pathoma:**
   * Watched all vids at 2x speed, didn’t take notes
   * The textbook it comes with is super readable
* **Sketchy:**
   * Micro = essential (pure memorization)
   * Pharm = helpful, but less of a priority if short on time because the videos aren't as good
* **Anki:**
   * Always finished my UWorld miss deck
   * Pathoma/Sketchy deck = secondary priority
   * Doing Anki daily gave me a small sense of progress and motivation

# Practice Test Tips

* Took most NBMEs untimed (except CBSEs, NBME 30, Free 120)
   * Not ideal, but I had bad test anxiety and couldn’t sleep before them
   * I still tracked time and never came close to running out
* **If possible, practice under timed conditions earlier than I did**

# Test Day Recap

* Woke at 5:30 AM, ate oatmeal + coffee
* Got to testing center early, started before 8 AM
* Finished each section with 10–15 mins to spare
* Skipped stats Qs, came back to them at the end
* **DO NOT change your answers unless you're 100% sure**
   * I would’ve missed 2 questions on test day if I changed my gut answers
* Snacks: granola bars, turkey jerky (ate more jerky than I have in my life lol), soda before the last section
* Felt alert the whole time despite nerves
* By the last section I literally thought, ""*let’s finish this b\*tch*"" and that got me through

# Final Advice

* **Do not take the exam until your practice test scores make you feel ready.**
   * You’ll probably feel unsure during the test and while waiting for your score—normal!
   * Having solid practice scores helped keep me grounded
* **Be proud of yourself.**
   * This test is incredibly hard
   * Take a moment post-exam to look in the mirror and say: *“I did my best, and that’s enough.”*

1kjl5na,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1kjl5na/the_unspoken_almost_we_are_so_carson_and_dio_coded/,The unspoken almost (we are so carson and dio coded),"I met him in Grade school. It wasn’t anything magical or soft — actually, it was kind of messy. He was the transferee, and I gave him a hard time, the way kids do when they don’t know how to process something new. He got mad and threw my bag in the trash, and somehow that chaos was the very beginning of something steady.

We grew up beside each other. By Grade 6, we were in the same friend group, trading inside jokes and stolen snacks, slowly carving space into each other's lives. I didn’t see him as anything more than just a friend back then, not even close. He was just him, a constant in the background of my growing-up years. Familiar. Loud. Reliable.

Somewhere along the way, that “just a friend” became “my best friend.”

It’s been 14 years now. Fourteen years of growing and hurting and healing and becoming, with him always nearby. He’s the first person I call when something good happens. He’s the one who knows how to read my silence and finish my sentences. We hang out just the two of us sometimes, late-night walks, spontaneous coffee runs, going to cinemas, sitting side by side in comfortable quiet. And it’s always been platonic… at least, it’s always looked that way from the outside.

But there have been moments.

Like the time in 4th year high school, when we went on that outing with friends. The day was carefree, full of laughter and sunshine, when in a brief, unexpected moment, he accidentally kissed my cheek. I froze — not because I was upset, but because I didn’t know what to do with the rush of feeling that followed. I laughed, too quickly, hoping it would cover up what had just happened. He panicked, worried he’d crossed a line, and apologized, but I brushed it off like it was nothing.

But inside?

I was screaming.

Because something inside me shifted. Maybe it wasn’t the kiss, but everything it represented, a connection that’s always been there but never quite named. Maybe it was because we’ve never been anything more than best friends. Maybe it was because he’s had girlfriends, I’ve had a boyfriends, and the timing has never been right. But in that moment, I knew something had changed, even if I wasn’t ready to admit it.

He held my hand once, too, back in our college years on an 8-12 hour bus ride from our province going back to manila. It was quiet, unspoken, but comforting — like it was meant to be that way. We didn’t need words. And that hug, that long hug later, felt like a silent understanding between us. The kind that doesn’t need explanation, just presence.

And then, there was that almost-kiss. I don’t even know how to explain it. I didn’t push him away. I didn’t pull him closer. I just let it be.

We’ve never been a couple. But we’ve been through everything else together. We’ve cried in front of each other, fallen apart and helped rebuild each other again, countless times. We’ve survived years and versions of ourselves that no one else even knew existed. There is something quietly beautiful about a love that has no label but all the weight of one.

Some days, I think we missed our moment. Other days, I think maybe this is the moment — not a love story in the traditional sense, but something deeper, softer, and more enduring.

We may never be more than best friends.

But if this is all it ever becomes — the inside jokes, the silent hand-holding, the almost-kisses, and the never-ending warmth — then I’ll still count myself lucky.

Why did the rules change when they've been drilled into our heads that shoulders = p*rn (and other such atrocious teachings)?

I have family in Utah that have been treated poorly (by TBMs) for being never-Mo's with their tatts, multiple piercings, coffee, alcohol, etc. Through the years, I've caught myself somewhat side-eyeing them and wondering where they'd end up in the afterlife when they are in fact good people.

I mean, I've wanted to leave since 2018 after I came out as LGBTQ, but something inside me switched to being hyper-religious instead of thinking further about leaving. 

Now, 7 years later, I've grown as a person, and my branch president is actually helping me leave Mormonism. I couldn't be happier to finally leave! Good riddance! 

I still can't believe how much of a judgemental person I was in the past as I held onto my Mormon beliefs. I even judged my best friend for wearing a sleeveless dress to prom! How sad is that?!",9,1746913280.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

I had a blood test done yesterday and was very confused by the results I saw.

Fasting BGL increased from 95 mg/dl (2024) to 105mg/dl (2025) and my fasting insulin was 8.9 (no value from last year). My a1c also increased from 5.6 to 5.8 which places me slightly above normal. I never had any issues and had completely optimal values before keto. I’m very active, lean, and do a lot of action sports as well as weightlifting. 

A normal day of eating for me looks like 10 pasture raised organic eggs, 2oz of grass fed butter, and some yogurt for breakfast. Later I have 1lb of grass fed ground beef with 2oz of butter. I have anywhere from 4-7 oz of kerrigold dubliner cheese a day as well. Some not so common but extra items are a little 0 carb habanero sauce, sometimes mustard, some black pepper, maybe some xylitol (PUR) gum, and that’s it. No alcohol, no coffee, no caffeine, only water for liquids. I supplement with vitamin D, k2, zinc, boron, C, and magnesium. Following this exact diet I’m at a ratio of 216g protein to 238g of fat which means that I’m at 28% protein and 71% fat which seems very spot on for macros. 

So what am I doing wrong here? My main concern is my fasting insulin over all other cause the BGL and A1c can be easily explained with RBC lifespan, BGL stabilization, etc but not insulin. My main theories are too much protein causing elevated amounts of gluconeogenesis, eating pasteurized cheese/dairy which inherently has lactose but doesn’t account for it in carbs on the label, or possibly one of my vitamins or xylitol?

Didn’t like my brows.  
Tiny words—  
Little snips.

I was a child again,  
listening to the symphony of sharp voices echoing off kitchen walls.  
She always had the last word.  
He always had the last nerve.  
I always had the front-row seat  
to a war no child should’ve ever been drafted into.

You know,  
it’s strange  
how someone can carry your history  
and still not know you at all.  
A familiar stranger,  
texting from another timezone,  
spilling critiques like she used to spill excuses.  
“I’m just being honest,” she says.  
But it’s not honesty—it’s erosion.

And I forgave her.  
I *keep* forgiving her.  
I carry the weight of her wounds like they’re heirlooms  
passed down in silence,  
wrapped in guilt and motherhood.

She left while I was away becoming someone.  
I came home to echoes.  
No note on the table.  
Just missing coffee cups and a colder silence.

Years later,  
she left the country too—  
as if her absence needed a passport stamp.  
And still, I wanted her to notice me.  
To *see* me.  
Not as some reflection of her disappointment,  
but as a breathing, bleeding, becoming human.

Today,  
a text about hair—  
and suddenly, I am unraveling again.

Do you know how many daughters  
are stitched together  
by threads of invisible mourning?  
Grieving mothers who are still alive—  
alive but unreachable,  
like a song you loved  
but can never quite sing right anymore.

And so, I write this.  
Not for closure.  
Not for peace.  
But for the record.  
So the child in me knows:  
She was wrong.  
And I am not her mirror.  
I am not the battlefield she forgot to clean up after.  
I am mine.

1kjkvc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kjkvc9/does_the_jura_z10_coffee_machine_offer_the/,Does the Jura Z10 Coffee Machine Offer the Ultimate Brew Experience Review?,"Testing the Jura 15361 Z10 Coffee Machine Aluminum White has been quite the experience. As someone who cherishes that first cup of coffee in the morning, I wanted to see if this premium machine lived up to its impressive specifications. From hot espressos to the innovative ability to prepare cold brews, this product promises quite a bit. Some points it excels at, others not so much, but for coffee enthusiasts, it’s definitely something to explore.

**Sophisticated Design That Stands Out**

Craftsmanship can’t be ignored here. The machine commands attention with its sleek aluminum white finish and the unique convex-concave front panel. I placed it on my kitchen counter, and it became a conversation starter among friends. The design screams premium quality, blending beautifully into a modern kitchen setup. However, its size (9.1 x 9.1 x 9.1 inches) means it does demand a fair amount of counter space. At 40 pounds, relocating it isn’t exactly convenient, but that is to be expected from a machine packed with high-end features.

**User Experience and Interface**

Utilizing the double-speed 4.3-inch touch display paired with the Blue Crystal Rotary Switch was genuinely satisfying. I appreciated how responsive and intuitive the controls were. Navigating through the Specialty Selection menu felt effortless, even during my groggy mornings. The artificial intelligence integrated into the system was a nice touch too. It learns my preferences over time and adapts to suggest possible choices, which feels incredibly modern. My nitpick? The learning curve with the touch display may take some users a few trials, especially older family members unused to tech-heavy devices.

[Check Jura 15361 Z10 Coffee Machine price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0d1gxrvmx/)

**Performance Backed by Advanced Technology**

The standout feature for me is the Product Recognizing Grinder (P.R.G). Whether I wanted a finely ground espresso or a coarser grind for my long drinks, the electronically controlled grinder adjusted in mere seconds. It eliminated the guesswork that comes with trying to manually set the grind size. Combined with the eighth-generation brewing unit, it was able to extract rich flavors consistently. The brewing process felt near-perfect due to the 3D brewing technology that ensures optimal water flow. Even non-coffee lovers in my home commented on the robust aroma filling the kitchen.

**Cold Brew Innovation**

Cold coffee has grown on me over the years, and this machine changes the game with its Cold Extraction Process. My previous attempts at ""cold brew"" involved brewing hot coffee and throwing a few ice cubes into it—far from a true cold brew. With this device, the coffee is brewed cold from the start, which results in extreme freshness and a smoother flavor. However, I noticed it does take slightly longer than hot brewing, but that’s expected for authentic cold brew preparation.

**Good Points**

- Precision grinding with advanced P.R.G.
- Genuine cold brew extraction process.
- Intuitive AI-driven Specialty Selection menu.
- Premium, modern design that elevates any space.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Occupies significant countertop space.
- Higher learning curve for less tech-savvy family members.
- Cold brew takes longer than traditional hot brewing.

**Competing Products**

When comparing this coffee machine to alternatives like the De’Longhi Dinamica Plus or Breville Oracle Touch, it’s clear the Jura Z10 holds its ground. Both competitors offer similar grind customization and brewing capabilities, but they fall short with cold brew. Breville’s more traditional interface can be easier to use, but it lacks the same level of modern AI integration. On the price front, the others might offer a slightly more affordable entry point, yet the innovation and impeccable execution of cold brewing justify Jura’s higher-end positioning. The Jura Z10 truly stands apart for anyone eager to expand their coffee horizons.

**Financial Value**

Is this machine worth the investment? It’s not every day you find a coffee machine that effortlessly transitions from espressos to cold brews. While the upfront costs may be higher compared to other coffee makers, what you’re paying for is engineering excellence and unparalleled versatility. If hot and cold coffee drinks are an integral part of your daily routine, and you value efficiency and consistency, this machine feels like quality for price.

My husband never does anything romantic for me.
Birthdays , he will wait til the last day and get something random as hell. Our first year married anniversary on April 20th  nothing at all. We had just gotten our taxes so he had no excuse . Valentine's day, same last thing on the shelf, no thought put into it . Like a card and a chocolate rose. I got over it but now it's mothers day and he got me and balloon and card. We have 5 kids I met him when I was barely turning 18 and now it's been 10 years and I thought he would try but no nothing , Instead he has all these thoughtful ideas for gifts for family members and for me never nothing. I do everything for him and our kids , I feel like since I don't work he thinks I just should be happy I don't work. But in reality I am frustrated because he won't do anything for me, not watch the kids while I shower , cook for him , get ready, go to the gym nothing . Every time I ask him for help with our kids he does it but it ends up he messes up or like something happens while he's doing the favor like a kid breaks a glass or something then all hell will break loose and it will be my fault. 
He never rubs my back, he never makes me a tea or like anything to take care of me. I don't want to be babied nor do I want a expensive gift I want to feel important for once though and it feels like he doesn't even like me for real. Like he's just with me cause we have these kids and he's always tired from work which I get but he started this job when we had our twins literally a few weeks after they were born. He never checked on me instead he came home tired and left more stress on me. Expects breakfast and lunch and coffee every morning when I was going thru the hardest time of my life having 2 newborns and 3 kids. Plus taking care of him. I got a hernia because I didn't recover from the c section and I have so much anger towards him because I feel like every day I waste my day and one day he's just gonna find someone better and leave me with nothing and all these kids..... I wish I could take care of myself but I have no time he expects me to spend every minute doing something if I spend a day being sick or just lazy he will make a big ass deal about it . He sweeps and cleans up at most once a week on the weekends and he literally will think of it as a favor to me when it's our home. He would change one diaper if I'm lucky a day Not poo and throw it in my face as if it was a favor and as if I don't change 2092829192 diapers a day from a new born til now. He doesn't cook , he won't even make himself a bowl of cereal dude. 



I don't have a job  because I have to pick up our kids from school and our toddler twins ....nor do I drive cause I have horrible anxiety due to a car cash .

1kjktyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/thousandoaks/comments/1kjktyg/warehouse_gym_idea/,Warehouse Gym Idea,"I have this crazy idea that’s been lingering because I feel like there are no good gyms here. As in good equipment, good environment and overall a place you want to go to workout rather a place to go just to check off your daily list. This idea would relate to those who really love to workout and invest time and money into their health. So if this is you, do you also feel like a gym like this is slacking in the Thousand Oaks area..?

So anyways my idea is to have a great warehouse gym with a coffee protein bar. A gym where it feels like 2 hours passed feels like 10 minutes and a hideaway for people to step away from life and focus on themselves. Specifically a warehouse gym so that the space feels open and breezy. I feel like big commercial gyms are just so busy, machines are never taken care of, amenities slack and ends up giving me anxiety rather than a place to focus. I thought it would be cool to add in a coffee bar because it’s easy and I love having a protein coffee shake after a workout. It’s simple, I would just transform a corner into a coffee bar. (coffee would be a purchase though not free bc I would want to get good quality items). I hope I convinced you that this would be a great place to workout. 

I was a barista at one point (worked over 6 years in F&B), love fitness & investing in my health, and currently doing accounting for a hotel so familiar with business numbers (to an extent). The problems are that I have no clue how to start a business and if this would be even possible. Also it’s probably extremely expensive to find a good warehouse to rent and on top of that, good quality equipment, and renovation to add in cool amenities like a sauna and cold plunge. 

Not sure why I’m sharing this, maybe just to get it out of my head, but maybe this post could go places if it’s seen by the right person haha. Thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

On site job a bit under 6 figures with PTO  
A2\~B1 Spanish  
Clock in time: 8:00 am April 24   
Clock out time: 6:00 pm May 4, Total duration 9.5 days

Ending report:  
8 closes  
14 dates  
3 I ended because they were noticeable catfishes  
Half the dates were 90%-completely in Spanish  
4 were into asian culture (here before someone says Kpop Karry lol)

  
My first time in Latam and I think I gotta say it’s better than Eastern Europe, especially during the winter. The weather, even approaching winter, is literally perfect. If we compare peak seasons, it’s up to debate though. I essentially just used like 3 of the most popular dating apps and tried to schedule as much as I can. All the dates came from online except one, who actually approached me during the day an hour after I landed, as I was eating on a stone table in a plaza. She told me it was peligroso to lay my stuff around, but I said la sola cosa peligrosa aqui es TU. She ended up buying me a sim card and a coffee and we met up later in the evening at my place. I then had another quick date right after that and closed also. So it was a very good introduction to South America!

Won’t describe every date since they were pretty straightforward: just quick coffee, walk, food, bus, my place or hers. I probably gathered around 300 matches total along with a ton of flakes, but I always was able to call in reinforcements. I ran airbnbs and used public transportation but also the Uber Moto, which was super fun. I did some clubbing but found it too homogenous and too hard to understand the Spanish in that environment. I travel lightly with just a backpack and a fanny pack, I try to do laundry during my half day mark locally. 

I performed cold approaches too, and almost all were responsive over text and said they were down to go out, but by the litmus test nothing happened. Give me a month and it'll definitely be possible. Back in the US I would rarely get responses even, even after getting contacts.

1kjksuu,https://v.redd.it/21xjoxncv00f1,Dialling in help[Turin Legato V2],"Hey folks,

I’m looking for some advice on dialing in my espresso setup. I’m using:
	•	Espresso Machine: Turin Legato V2
	•	Grinder: DF64 Gen 2
	•	Coffee: Medium roast
	•	Grind Setting: 8.5
	•	Dose: 17.5 grams
	•	Yield & Time: Pulling ~38.4 grams in 15 seconds

Roast date: 20 March 2025
Tasting notes from roaster: orange marmalade, strawberry, toffee, dark chocolate 
Roaster: Savorworks
Workflow: WDT
Filter basket: Muvna mesh style basket 18 grams

The shots have decent body, but I’m getting almost no flavor — very flat and underwhelming. No bitterness, but also no brightness or complexity.

From what I understand, this could be underextracted due to the fast flow, but I’m unsure how much to adjust and in what direction. Should I grind finer, up the dose, or both? Any input on how others dial in medium roasts on a similar setup would be appreciated.",1,1746912385.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1kjkrqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/westjet/comments/1kjkrqn/is_this_a_normal_premium_experience/,Is this a normal premium experience?,"I flew WestJet on a Delta-issued ticket. I had a Z fare class, which for Americans is first-class/business-class. While I've flown WestJet before, my prior experiences were shortish flights on regional aircraft. This time, it was a 737-700 with three rows of domestic U.S.-style first-class seats marketed as WestJet premium. The flight was Detroit to Calgary, which is almost 4 hours in duration.

Flight boarded 10 minutes ahead of the published boarding time. Of course, no boarding announcement was made terminal-wide. And the priority lane wasn't used.

No pre-departure meal selection online, either through Delta or WestJet. Likewise, no special meal option or even a menu telling me what I would get.

No closet for suit jackets/blazers. What do Canadians do in the winter when they have coats?

First row of overhead bins, intended for passengers in row 1, were occupied with crew bags. Really?

No pre-departure beverage.

Paper tablecloth that didn't even cover the tray table.

While the cutlery was metal, the napkin was paper.

No Canadian wine. How do you not serve Canadian wine? Just a gas station quality prosecco and a chardonnay from France's Vin de Pays d'Oc. The menu passed out after boarding advertised rose and red, but the flight attendant said they weren't catered with either. Again, how do you not serve Canadian wines from British Columbia's Okanagan appellation or Ontario's Niagara appellation?

No second round of drinks served with the meal. One meal service before the food and that was it. Not even water or coffee. 

The main course was a choice of chicken cordon bleu or a red pepper salad. That's it.

No snack basket.

No TV monitor. No headphones. No blanket. No pillows.

Wifi wasn't free.

One flight attendant for all three rows, which I thought odd because it seemed like a second cabin crew member should have at least served the meals and drinks. One person taking orders, cooking meals, serving meals, refilling drinks, and clearing serviceware even in a three-row premium cabin is a bit much.

When it’s good it’s great, then she disappears","Title is a bit dramatic but I (32M) have met this woman (30F) a year ago. Since then, we have been seeing each other and talking here and there. I think I am lowkey infatuated with her *because* of how elusive she is. She’s legitimately my dream woman — beautiful, fit, former athlete, successful in her career, independent, smart as hell, no kids, excellent personality, and a magician in bed. When we do talk, the conversation is engaging and fun. Never a dull moment around this girl. We talked about being more serious and intentional, she seemed receptive, but then disappeared again. 

To give some context, on our first date we got coffee and then hooked up. After that, she answered maybe 2 texts over the next 2 months, so I thought she didn’t like me. Then, she picked right back up with consistent texting, we had dinner then, slept together. She vanished for another 3 months. It’s been like this for a year now. She’d either reply to a text that went unanswered or hit me with “howdy howdy” and I am back in the cycle. 

And no, she’s not secretly married or living with anyone. I went to her house and she very clearly lives alone. 

I haven’t dated anyone since. I feel like every time she hits me up, I drop everything else. I know I would do the same if I were in a relationship so that’s why I stay single. I am not ugly or desperate either and have success with women. Women approach me in daily life. Just not *this particular woman* and I can’t figure out why. I tried to do everything from planning fun dates to sending good morning texts to putting on my best sex game — it still ends with her losing interest after a few days/weeks. 

What am I doing wrong? What’s going on here? I have been thinking of sending her a text expressing how I feel and that I would like to explore this more seriously. ",0,1746911852.0,dating_advice,4,0.33,False

I Am Struggling With How Low Personal Injury Settlements Are In English After My Crash.,"After a lifetime of hearing massive personal injury payouts in the news I am shocked at how low compensation payouts are in England.



I 20M was in a car crash in 2023 where I suffered a broken ulna, a severely dislocated shoulder and a traumatic brain injury. I am now in the process of legal proceedings to get compensation for my injuries, however I am shocked at how low they are. I'm always hearing on the news people getting million pound payouts for spilling hot coffee on themselves or a workplace accident however I'm looking at around possibly as low  as 20,000 pounds. 



A bit more about my injuries, I suffered a moderate to severe traumatic brain injury which has left me with lasting consequences confirmed by a neuropsychiatrist report. I am currently studying medicine in first year and am somewhat OK but struggling slightly. I feel like I would have been better without my TBI as my neuropsychiatrist report said it was likely that my concentration and short term memory had been impaired. I am worried about fourth year when the course gets really hard as these neurological problems are long lasting. As well as this, I have permanent loss of movement in my shoulder joint (50% loss of lateral rotation of the arm) and although I can still play racket Sports I am nowhere near as capable as before. Every time I play it leaves me with pain.



I thought compensation was supposed to be reflective  of injury severity; however if you offered me 20,000 pounds to be as bad as I am at Sports and my studies for the rest of my life I would turn it down in a heartbeat. However, I have found it difficult to quantify my injuries in monetary terms as there doesn't seem to be a set framework for each injury in England.  Is this really how much you would get for life-changing injuries? and how can I make sure that I get what I feel I deserve.

I’m a full-time spiritual teacher with a background in **numerology, astrology, and mindfulness coaching**, and yes, I still get goosebumps when someone sees their life path number for the first time and everything *clicks*. 

  
I’ve been doing this work for over 6 years now, ever since my own “dark night of the soul” (aka my Saturn Return wrecked my plans and woke me up). Before this, I worked in marketing, drank way too much coffee, and thought tarot cards were just pretty illustrations. Life has a wild sense of humor.

Now I work with people from all over the world to help them:

* Understand the repeating patterns in their lives (yes, 11:11 means something)
* Decode their birth chart for emotional healing and direction
* Ground themselves during chaotic energy using mindful routines
* See how numerology can show them their soul’s blueprint

I’m not a fortune teller. I won’t tell you when you’ll meet your soulmate. But I *can* help you figure out what’s blocking you from calling that person in, energetically, emotionally, even karmically.

I meditate daily (even if it’s just 6 minutes), I swear by lunar journaling, and I always look up a person’s rising sign before I hire them. 🤓

**Ask me anything, about your chart, your path, weird spiritual dreams, how to deal with retrogrades, or even what it’s like doing this work full-time. I’m here to share.**

1kjkd1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1kjkd1z/us_a_different_kind_of_fb_scam_for_what_purpose/,(US) A different kind of FB scam - for what purpose?,"I'm familiar with the scam posts on FB where someone will post about a lost/found child or pet to get people to share - then once it's been shared, they switch out the original post. It's not too hard to spot them because it's always in some kind of sales group, instead of a news or lost and found page. A newer one I've been seeing in a local food group is where the person claims to be new to town, or moving to town and wants to meet people for coffee or find places to eat. Seems innocuous enough, but then when you look at the person's profile, it's always some model-pretty woman with photos of her in exotic locations and she has no friends or followers. There was just one posted today and the poster turned off commenting, What's the purpose of these types of posts? How does the scam work?

I operated barista machines at every restaurant I worked at, but straightforward so no tinkering.  I thought I was bougie in 2003 when I bought and loved a Cuisinart  espresso machine (meh) - and then I tasted my first best coffee (Blue Bottle S.F.).  You don't go back from that.  I have, Moka Potted, Nespresso'd, French Pressed, Poured Over... I haven't dialled this in.  So my tiny little Nespresso crapped the bed this week.  I am at the stage in my life where I am ready for something serious, because I need to make that best coffee in my own home.  Maybe I'll upgrade down the road if I find myself nerding out on it.  But for now, in a budget not to exceed $1000 Canadian Dollars ($800 would be sweet), what the heck should I buy?

Decision fatigue is mounting - I have read a lot of threads here and google searches etc - I began to unravel when I read something about a person using chemex paper cut outs and 20 other objects I no not of.  Serious Eats recommended the Breville Bambino Plus but it's not available on Amazon atm. My sister said something about the Phillips Machines (her coffee is so-so).  Happy to buy separate grinder and all the gadgets the kids are talking about these days.

1kjk9dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1kjk9dm/could_downy_light_laundry_scent_booster_beads/,Could Downy Light Laundry Scent Booster Beads Ocean Mist Review Transform Your Laundry Routine?,"Longing for that fresh-out-of-the-washer aroma that sticks around longer than your morning coffee? I decided to give the Downy 30772087794 Light Laundry Scent Booster Beads, Ocean Mist a spin and see if it could deliver a laundry day experience worth hyping about. Before diving in, I’d like to mention how much I lean toward subtle scents – overpowering ones are a no-go for both my clothes and my nose. Looks promising, right? Well, let’s unpack the good and less-than-good sides here.

**A Delightful Design with Simplicity at Its Core**  
The first thing I noticed upon unboxing this item was the sleek and functional packaging design. It's compact enough to fit snugly in the laundry cabinet, while the screw-on lid made it a breeze to portion out these bead-like granules. The bright, inviting ocean-blue color added a subtle charm that matched its “Ocean Mist” theme. What took the day, though, was the cap's dual role as a measuring tool. This flexibility came in handy, especially on those ""I need extra freshness"" laundry loads.

**How It Performs in Laundry**  
After several weeks of incorporating these beads into my laundry routine, I observed how impactful they were at keeping clothes smelling fresh – not just for hours, but days! I threw them in my gym outfits, heavy-duty sheets, and even delicate fabrics like silk. No matter how heavy the load was or how high the washer’s cycle, they dissolved perfectly, leaving no residue at all. I appreciated the controlled scent dispersion; the aroma of ""Ocean Mist"" was present but not overwhelming or artificial-smelling.

**Check [Downy 30772087794] price on Amazon.**

**Key Benefits**  
- Exudes a delicate, long-lasting scent.  
- Works flawlessly across diverse fabric types.  
- Dissolves without leaving residue or clumping.  

**What Sets It Apart: The Aroma of Ocean Mist**  
The subtle yet intoxicating ""Ocean Mist"" fragrance of the granules deserves special mention! It’s this perfect balance—evoking the gentle essence of a breezy seaside and fresh marine air. Every time I opened my wardrobe, it honestly felt like a mini summer vacation packed into scent beads. Let’s just say the mental refresh was worth it, especially during dreary cold months.

**Ease of Use and Customizability**  
No beads left scattered or spilling all over the floor—woo! Using these little power pellets was straightforward. After measuring out a capful (or sometimes half when I wanted a milder effect), into the washer's drum they’d go before adding clothes. This customization was ideal – some days demanded extra flair, while others required a neutral softness. Plus, being compatible across all washing machines made it less nerve-wracking to experiment.

**Areas of Concern to Consider**  
Like every great product, there are areas that could be improved:  

- Beads can be a tad messy if spilled during measuring.  
- Individuals extremely sensitive to fragrances might still find it too noticeable.  

**Competing Products and How This Stacks Up**  
If you’ve used Gain Fireworks Scent Beads or Arm & Hammer’s In-Wash Freshness Boosters before, you’d notice competition is fairly tight in the scent-booster segment. The standout for Downy here is the fragrance sophistication—it’s understated and not overpowering like Gain but doesn’t lean closer toward industrial neutrality, which Arm & Hammer occasionally feels like. Where some other brands include dyes, these Downy beads steer dye-free, which feels reassuring for delicates and fabrics in direct skin contact.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the premium scent experience, the product offers great bang for the buck. Other boosters sitting on nearby aisles might come in at slightly lower sticker prices, but the lasting freshness on laundry (and my mental resets every time I caught a whiff of Ocean Mist) was genuinely unmatched. If you’re looking for affordable quality, this product easily checks the box.

1kjk90d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1kjk90d/mothers_day_weekend_disappointment/,Mother’s Day weekend disappointment,"Feeling a bit hurt by my husband’s thoughtlessness and selfishness this weekend. Probably too idealistic of me but I was eager to feel special and celebrated this weekend (maybe time for a nap or a bath, to read and relax!) and it’s very clear to me that he has nothing planned, nor am I able to relax. 

He’s spent this whole day gaming. This morning he slept in until 11 and I ended up bringing him breakfast and coffee in bed (which to me would be *such* a treat!) because it was getting cold in the kitchen. (I needed him to wake and watch the kids so I could go grocery shopping). I asked him to have the kids make me a special card or craft, so I took my time grocery shopping. I came home to a filthy house, kids had not been fed lunch and he’d been gaming the whole time I was gone. 

Special event after special event I just feel so unimportant. He does Christmas shopping for me on Christmas Eve and never gets me anything I ask for because..it’s too late. I know that sounds so small and petty, but to me it feels like I’m not a priority. If a man loves his wife wouldn’t he put in the effort to make her feel important?? Wouldn’t he be able to expend just a tiny bit of effort to plan something for her? 

Men who suck at special occasions, please advise. I’d love to hear things from your perspective right now. I love my husband. I don’t want to be upset with him. ",8,1746910869.0,Christianmarriage,4,1.0,False

-
i begged my grandparents to throw stuff out, i threw my stuff out but they didn’t throw theirs out! i’m at a recovery point where I kinda eat what I want, Im not as bad as I used to be with my phobia. yesterday i forgot my coffee creamer was “bad” and put it in my coffee. I didn’t think anything of it because i forgot, then a few hours later i had diarrhea at work. that’s when i realized i used creamer that was in the fridge during the power outage. 
-
I just started seeing this guy in march and we had dinner plans. i was kinda panicking because i was scared i was sick because i had diarrhea. i kinda just shook it off because sometimes i just have diarrhea. I WAS WRONG. we go out to eat and we are going to tj maxx, the second we get to tj maxx i knew I HAD TO GOOOOO. I run to the bathroom and have diarrhea again. he knows what’s going on even though i didn’t wanna tell him because i literally had to sprint to the bathroom. he runs into someone he knows and i have to go to the bathroom 2 more times before i finally tap him while he’s talking to his friend and say “we need to go back to your place im sick” 
-
 so im driving back to his house, 10 mins in i realize i have to shit again :) he says there’s a sheetz coming up. i stop in the parking lot and all of a sudden i have to puke!!! but if i puke right there i am literally gonna SHIT myself because i also had to shit. i RUN to the bathroom and have diarrhea again and im hovering over the toilet scared to throw up, im actually shaking but at this point i want it to happen because i feel so awful. i end up not puking yet. i get in the car and take a zofran (bad idea) because i don’t wanna puke.

get back to his house, immediately have to go again. the nausea comes back x20. i go to his room with a bag and he’s trying to comfort me and im telling him to get out because i dont wanna puke in front of him. i don’t know if it’s the zofran kicking in, but i dry heaved 3 different times with barely anything coming out. it didn’t feel great, but it was not as bad as i thought it was gonna be! i think the zofran kept me from actually puking unfortunately. 

from old posts if you know me, i threw up in thailand last year after not throwing up for 13 years - and that really helped my fear. i think it really helped prepare me last night, and i ended up not really puking because nothing really came out? but i definitely kept it together and im proud of myself…also surprised this guy still wants to see me after the rollercoaster last night 😂😂😂

if you’re still reading, thank you! just know i’ve had this awful phobia my WHOLE LIFE and if I can recover and get through what happened last night, so can you!!! also feeling 100% better today. it was either the creamer or the dinner - or both. 😂 ",7,1746910858.0,emetophobiarecovery,2,1.0,False
1kjk8a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1kjk8a5/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

I’m visiting Bucharest next weekend and I’m not rushing to see everything. I actually prefer just soaking up the atmosphere of a place.

Are there any spots you’d recommend where I can just sit with a coffee or snack and people-watch for a while? Parks, plazas, little hidden cafés — anything that feels local and relaxed.

I’ll be staying near Universitate, but I don’t mind walking or taking the metro. Bonus if there’s a view or some live music.

I moved back to Canada after being away for 2 years, and I lost touch with most of my friends. I will be meeting one friend on Monday, which is great, but I still want to make new friends.

So last week I met someone for a coffee chat who was interested in learning more about my career, and I gave her the advice of using a platform to join events. She ended up making new friends by attending an event. I felt like I should start taking my own advice. At the end, she invited me to a rave party event, which is a techno event. I’m not the party type but felt like I should step out of my comfort zone. I also love dressing up, but at the same time, I’m not sure if I’ll be comfortable going out late at night until the morning and might get sensory overload. Or maybe I’m just exaggerating and might enjoy it. Not sure.

I initially agreed to meet for the party, but now I’m wondering if I should not go and ask her to meet for something else instead? ",1,1746910528.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The way i dress. I'm (imo) never too provocative or anything and i've never been told by my (strict-ish) parents that what i'm wearing isn't appropriate. I stick to tank tops, jeans and reasonable-in-length skirts/dresses when going out.  

For backstory, a few months ago, after my 18th birthday, I went out to a club with just my friends in a semi sheer lace tank top and jeans. He didn't come, because he wasn't in the mood. I showed him what i was wearing on facetime, and he didn't say anything, which is unusual because he always hypes me up and says i look gorgeous. I don't think much of it, go out and when I come back, he says ""why do you always dress so sl\*tty"" Obviously I was confused and hurt, but he apologised and it was fine. He was, however always a bit jealous after that, and like 2 weeks ago he got really upset with me for saying ""love ya bye"" to a mutual (guy) friend of ours I've known since the 7th grade. He didn't say it back (lol) and I'm pretty sure he didn't even hear me. I apologised A LOT and he got over it. 

So yesterday, we were talking about how fun this summer was going to be, and i said (jokingly) ""You won't catch me out of the tiniest bikini lmao"" and he got so angry and again, asked the question ""why do you always dress so sl\*tty"" and how i'm ""dressing to attract men"" again and again. Honestly, It really hurt my feelings especially because a few guys last year spread this horrible rumour about me and my friends, which he knows about. Here's where I might have to say sorry. I got angry at him, shouting about how it wasn't my fault people looked at me (for reference, he's told me about how he gets super insecure about other guys looking at me) and that I didn't want to date an insecure guy. After, I said that we needed to set boundaries with what is and isn't okay to say and do, and he got really upset. Now he's being really passive aggressive, saying stuff like ""Oh is it within your *boundaries* for me ask if you want coffee"". I'm worried he's really upset, and i don't want to lose him over this.

1kjk2wh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kjk2wh,Your Completed Requests: Part 6,"Hello and welcome to this post of mine!! I will admit that I almost didn’t end up making this today as, not only did I sleep in for a really long time but, I also went on a walk with my sister and FINALLY started to watch Gintama haha 

Now, this will be the last part of requests (I know there there’s technically two more but one of them is a part 2 to a previous request and the other is a request I haven’t started writing yet ♪(´ε｀ ) ) and our lovely requester is none other than u/WeebCatMom (๑>◡<๑)

This fic in particular is the longest one out of the bunch with a whopping total of just over 5,000 words but hopefully that number doesn’t throw you off as I had a ton of fun writing this fic and wanted to cram as much stuff in as possible (there are even stuff I didn’t end up writing about in the end!!)

Also, this may be a bit of a spoiler but, if you scroll past the request, you’ll find the kitty cats I got inspired by!! The white cat is very well cared for by the locals and when I see them on my way home from work, I make sure to give them lots of pets ╰(*´︶` *)╯♡ 

For the fic, the white cat is a kitten and was actually born from the litter the other cat had SO, when LG and CXS find out after the ending of this fic, CXS jokes about and says they’re grandfathers too haha 

But, enough of my rambles for here comes the summary!! ♪(๑ᴖ◡ᴖ๑)♪

*Adopting a new member of the family might have seemed easy due to their previous experience with Elizabeth however things weren't going to be the same as before*

*This time they- Lu Guang, had planned every step of the plan and calculated the best course of action. They had an appointment at the animal shelter and were going to make use of their free time to have a date at the pet shop for any important items they needed to replenish. All that being said, Cheng Xiaoshi being Cheng Xiaoshi had decided to crush their plans when he found an abandoned kitten tucked away in a cardboard box and Lu Guang couldn't say no to his boyfriend...*

*He could never say no*

##Beginners Guide to Parenting 

Spring was coming to an end and Cheng Xiaoshi had taken it upon himself to get both Lu Guang and Qiao Ling to partake in a rather long hike up the mountains together. The pathway were filled with twists and turns but the cheerful member of the party had rushed on ahead; disappearing from sight for only a few moments until the others rounded a particular bend.

It was pleasant to be able to enjoy this time with the two people he cared about and it wasn't long before Qiao Ling had come chasing after him; leading to the two of them running off in a mad scramble to be the first one to get past one of the large trees just out of sight. 

Cheng Xiaoshi was in the lead until the very last moment and, much to his annoyance, Qiao Ling turned to look at him with a smug grin. The two of them were out of breath but it clear that his sister had thought that it was worth it. 

""I just got distracted."" He whined with a pout, crossing his arms as he attempted to not appear as out of breath as he felt. 

The only response he got was Qiao Ling's laughter and, after a few moments, Lu Guang eventually re-united with them.

""It's true!"" Cheng Xiaoshi insisted before taking Lu Guang's hand into his own and leaning into him. ""Tell her that I would have won otherwise. Pleeeeease, Guang Guang~!"" 

""Hey! No fair!"" Qiao Ling snaps before Lu Guang could respond to his lover's wishes. ""You know Lu Guang would do anything for you!""

""Not anything."" Lu Guang mumbles out but his words are left unanswered as the other two continue their playful bickering.

They continue their hike and it doesn't take long before they reach a fork in the road. One section continues along the dirt track whilst the other pathway is a long set of stairs surrounded by vast amounts of trees, greenery and wild flowers adding speckles of colour to the environment.

""This way!"" Cheng Xiaoshi instructs cheerfully as he goes up the stairs two steps at a time and Lu Guang can't resist the urge to let out a grumble. 

This wasn't exactly what he had in mind but, then again, he hadn't planned for a hike either. 

The trio carefully made their way up the vast amounts of steps; pausing every now and again so Lu Guang could catch his breath. Even though he told them that he just wanted to admire the flowers, both Qiao Ling and Cheng Xiaoshi could read through his bluff. However, they let him off the hook and took in the many different violets, fringed iris's and windflowers. 

Eventually, they reached the top of the stairs and were greeted by a small little cottage surrounded by a stone fence and the faint sound of a waterfall could be made out in the distance. Beyond the fence was a little sitting area and a pleasant aroma filled the air.

With a step and a spin to face the others, Cheng Xiaoshi wore a smug grin as he gestured towards the cosy building.

""Surprise! This little cottage is where we'll be for the next few hours!"" He explains cheerfully, more than a little proud of himself for succeeding on surprising them. ""I was talking to a client a few days ago and they said that the food here was the best! You'll love it!""

He happily takes their hands and, after a shared look between Qiao Ling and Lu Guang, they let themselves be dragged to one of the many benches.

Their table had been placed close to the stone wall and, due to this, they were able to overlook the vast amount of trees they had been walking through only minutes ago. There was also a waterfall just within sight which, while only small, trickled into a lake filled with lily pads and... 

Was that a paw Lu Guang had seen?

As Qiao Ling and Cheng Xiaoshi talked about the menu, pointing out all the little snacks and beverages on offer, Lu Guang found his attention drifting to what he had just seen. It wasn't long before a tabby cat popped their head out of the bush and Lu Guang observed as a cat escaped from the shrubbery before turning around to wait for another kitten to appear. 

It wasn't long before there was a group of cats and all of them were bathing in the warm rays of the sun and relaxing to the best of their abilities. 

It was almost tranquil until Lu Guang heard an over-dramatic gasp coming from his roommate and he turned to see his friend had also noticed the family of cats; eyes wide and almost sparkling with excitement.

""You didn't know about the cats?"" He questions and Cheng Xiaoshi quickly shakes his head. 

""If I did... Well, I wouldn't have said anything but I wouldn't be acting like this that's for sure!"" He remarks playfully, admiring the many different breeds of cats they could see.

Lu Guang gazes at Cheng Xiaoshi for a few moments before sharing a look with Qiao Ling and letting out a light chuckle. ""Yeah, you've never been the type who could hide stuff from me."" 

""I hid the café from you!"" His boyfriend reminds himself, puffing his chest out with a look of pride which quickly falters when he notices that Lu Guang's attitude hadn't changed. ""Wait... You knew???""

""I had my suspicions but I didn't know what you were hiding from me until now."" Lu Guang admits and Cheng Xiaoshi lets out a sigh of relief before returning his attention to the cats; gesturing at one that had pure white fur and was snuggling against another cat with brown fur. 

""That's us if we were cats!"" He chirps cheerfully before pointing to another cat, which had short black fur that seemed soft to the touch, and seemed to be actively turned away from the cosy cats. ""And that's our lovely landlady!""

""Don't drag me into your lovely-dovey scenarios."" Qiao Ling grumbles before letting out a warm chuckle of her own. ""But, you're not wrong. I mean, neither of you can keep your hands off each other.""

Before a flustered Cheng Xiaoshi can make a retort, a gentle looking waitress arrives at their table to take their order. She wore a simple apron covered in pastel flowers and had a white kerchief which kept her dark hair out of the way.

Cheng Xiaoshi, proudly showing his skills at remembering what his cherished loved ones liked, ordered Qiao Ling a Chai Latte with a slice of carrot cake, Lu Guang a black americano with a slice of coffee and walnut cake and, for himself, he got a hot chocolate and a slice of apple pie.

Once everything had been written down in the waitress's notepad, she left them to their own devices and they had once again returned their attention to the furry creatures still happily lazing about in the warmth.

""Remember how we looked after Elizabeth for a while?"" Cheng Xiaoshi remarks somewhat casually.

Internally acknowledging that his boyfriend was building up to something, Lu Guang awaited for his next words patiently.

""We should get another cat and this time we won't have to return them. We could be like that cats parents or something!""

""And what makes you so certain that we should be getting another cat?"" Lu Guang asks despite the building sense of anticipation looming in the back of his mind. ""Qiao Ling might not-""

""Do what you want."" Qiao Ling interrupts before Lu Guang could use her as a potential excuse. ""So long as it doesn't break anything in the photo studio, I don't care.""

Resisting the urge to pout, he returns his attention to his boyfriend who, like he had just won a prize at a carnival, grins at him.

""I know you want one~"" Cheng Xiaoshi muses, leaning into the other and pressing his head against his shoulder. ""Those toys you bought have been in storage ever since Elizabeth went back home soooooooo, what do you say~? You want to be a father with me?""

Swallowing down his nerves and attempting to conceal the growing blush spread across his face, Lu Guang turns his gaze away from the others and fiddles with the inner lining of his jacket.

""...Maybe... I need some time to think about it first..."" 

He can feel their eyes on him but refuses to return their looks. Even when the duo had turned their attention elsewhere and had seemingly forgotten their recent discussion, Lu Guang was unable to rid his mind from the idea of being a father with Cheng Xiaoshi. The idea wasn't simple by any means but it was one which sent his heart aflutter, enticed his mind with the many possibilities of what could happen and lifted his spirits in a way he never felt before.

It was a similar feeling to when Cheng Xiaoshi had first confessed his feelings to him but also carried a sense of anxiety as he himself wasn't sure if he was fit for such a role. 

Even though they would be adopting a cat, this didn't change how serious this matter was to Lu Guang and, even when their order had arrived and was subsequently feasted upon, it continued to play in his mind.

Noticing Lu Guang's lack of presence, submerged in his own thoughts to fully pay attention to the other two, Cheng Xiaoshi had made the executive decision to keep his sister entertained.

They took in the cats perched in their drinks, which had been made from large blobs of frothy milk, as well as the cute mug Lu Guang's coffee had come in. They indulged in the pure bliss that came from eating their slices of cake, allowing the other to try a small bite from each of their selected treats; resulting in the two having a minor bicker amongst themselves when Cheng Xiaoshi quickly scooped up more of the cake than he was allowed.

Lu Guang had been so deep in thought that, before he knew it, they had reunited with the car they had rented for the day and noticed that Cheng Xiaoshi was happily carrying a take-out box together with a colourful flask; presumably filled with the coffee Lu Guang had only taken a few sips of.

""I'll dri-""

""You don't have a licence."" Lu Guang interrupts Cheng Xiaoshi, finally snapping out of his thoughts.

""And he's back!"" his boyfriend grins brightly before letting an overdramatic cheer, pressing a kiss on Lu Guang's cheek and scrambling into the passenger seat. 

After sharing a look with Qiao Ling, they both join Cheng Xiaoshi in the car and begin their journey back home; music playing in the background to fill the silence.

It wasn't until night had fully arrived did Lu Guang allow himself to proceed with his plan and turned on their shared laptop. Cheng Xiaoshi was fast asleep in the top bunk so he used to desk lamp to provide himself with just enough light; not wanting to wake his boyfriend up just after he had fallen asleep. He knew that it was Cheng Xiaoshi's fault for falling asleep during the car journey, thus making it difficult for him to get comfortable when it was finally time to actually sleep, but he couldn't bring himself to get annoyed at the other. 

Sparing a glance at the top bunk, Lu Guang begun his goal for the night and searched up the local shelters in the area; making sure to check any bits of information he needed to keep in mind and what steps they would need to follow. 

Eventually, he was able to find the perfect place and submitted the required application; making sure to state that they would be looking for the cat upon arrival. Leaning back in his chair and staring at the 'thank you' page that filled the screen, Lu Guang felt exhilaration twist in his stomach and send sparks of light into his heart. 

He'd done it.

He had taken the first few steps to surprising their boyfriend with a trip to the shelter. A trip that would solidify his desire to be a parent with Cheng Xiaoshi.

With a deep breath, Lu Guang turned off the laptop and carefully climbed to the top bunk. As soon as he was under the covers, he felt his boyfriend's arms snake around his waist and pull him close. 

Closing his eyes and leaning into Cheng Xiaoshi's embrace, Lu Guang felt as his boyfriend's presence dispersed any remaining specks of anxiety; helping him to drift off to sleep.

It wasn't until the night before the appointment did Cheng Xiaoshi proceed to give Lu Guang a surprise of his own in the form of a dirty looking kitten whose fur was coated in a layer of thick mud.

That afternoon it had been raining and, unlike their usual routine where they would both go to the supermarket and buy that weeks groceries, Cheng Xiaoshi had gone alone. Lu Guang had used to the excuse that he needed to develop some photos before tomorrow and, like always, Cheng Xiaoshi happily bought his excuse and left the photo studio without another word.

After double-checking, and even triple-checking, the schedule, Lu Guang only let himself relax when he was certain that he knew exactly what their plans were for tomorrow; even down to the very minute. He was going to make sure that everything would go as smoothly as possible and that any possible delays were factored into the plan.

He took a breath and flicked open the book he had been casually reading. Unfortunately, he found that he was unable to focus as a growing sense of dread ate away at him and, while he could excuse this for being the remaining effects of Cheng Xiaoshi not being within eye-shot, it meant that he was unable to fully focus on the book; ultimately leading to him closing it and returning it to it's spot on the table. 

Unable to keep himself still, he decides to preoccupy his mind by finding one of the old-fashioned camera's they had in the store and got to cleaning the many pieces. 

When his boyfriend finally returned to their photo studio, Lu Guang took in the fact that not only was Cheng Xiaoshi not wearing the coat he had gone out in but, the article of clothing was bundled up in his arms and it quickly became clear that something was hidden within it's confines.

""Welcome home."" Lu Guang greets his lover before placing a fresh roll of film into the camera and carefully putting it away. ""What do-""

His question is interrupted by a weak meow and, after a shared look between the two of them, it was clear that Cheng Xiaoshi hadn't made that noise. 

""What happened?""

The only response he got from his partner was a sheepish chuckle before he presented what exactly he had bundled up. 

A tiny kitten with golden eyes and, even if the dirt made it impossible to tell what colour their fur was, one of their ears had a few nasty scars. 

""Pass me the kitten."" Lu Guang orders. ""I want you to call the vet and tell them that we'll be on the way with a kitten. For now, I'll give them a bath."" He gazes at Cheng Xiaoshi for a few moments before letting out a breath. ""And, please dry your hair before you get sick.""

After an over-dramatic salute, as well as a kiss on the cheek, Cheng Xiaoshi pulls out his phone. Lu Guang watches as his boyfriend realises that his phone had run out of battery and then scampers around the counter to try their landline. Letting out a warm chuckle, he takes the kitten to the nearby sink and begins to fill it up with warm water.

Going over what he had read when they had taken care of Elizabeth, he had a rough idea on what he should do in this situation. Even if it would result in his clothes getting soaked, it would be worth it. 

He carefully took the kitten from out of it's make-shift bed and placed it's paws into the warm water. Having anticipated the kitten to quickly reject the warm sensation on their paws, Lu Guang was surprised to see that the kitten seemed to be enjoying it instead. 

Unable to stop the smile from spreading on his face, Lu Guang turns off the tap, soaks a nearby cloth and begins to gently wipe away the filth clinging to the kittens body. 

He was in such deep concentration that he didn't notice that Cheng Xiaoshi had joined him in until he felt arms wrap around his waist. 

""You make a good father, you know?"" Cheng Xiaoshi whispers softly before nuzzling into his boyfriend's neck.

""And you'd make a disorganised one."" Lu Guang remarks, hints of playfulness peeking through as he continues to clean the kitten.

""Wh- Why?"" His lover splutters and Lu Guang didn't even need to look to know that he was pouting.

""You know why. I had plans for us tomorrow.""

""We can still do them.""

""We could but..."" He trails off, taking in the patches of white fur coming through the streaks of thick mud.

""Buuuuuut?"" 

""If we can't find the owner of this kitten then we'll already have one to look after.""

""What do you..."" It takes a few moments before Cheng Xiaoshi lets out a gasp and takes a few steps back. ""Were you planning on adopting a cat??""

With a sigh, Lu Guang nods his head. ""Remember when we went for that walk with your sister?""

""Yeah?""

""I've been thinking about it ever since and I wanted to surprise you.""

""Just like I did!"" His boyfriend beams brightly.

""Yes. Just like you did."" Lu Guang echoes before finally managing to get rid of the last bits of gunk.

Cheng Xiaoshi passes him a towel and he carefully wraps the baby kitten up before getting to work on drying their fur.

""We can talk about this later."" Lu Guang states, leaving no room for compromise. ""How did the call go?""

""Told me that we could take this little guy in to the vets now but, after I told them how I found 'im, they'll need to keep them in for a couple days to go over a few tests.""

""Right... Can you get the carrier from the attic?""

***

When they had returned home, Cheng Xiaoshi had immediately collapsed on the lower bunk bed and gave a sleepy smile in Lu Guang's direction.

""What is it?"" He finds himself mumbling as he takes a seat next to his boyfriend; leaning forward to brush at his bangs.

""I just love you so much it's unbelievable."" 

""What makes it so unbelievable?"" 

""Just... You were so cool today. I love how you're able to take charge of everything when I struggle on making the most basic decisions.""

""You have your strengths."" Lu Guang whispers softly before placing a kiss on his boyfriend's forehead.

""But am I cool?""

The few moments of hesitation was enough for Cheng Xiaoshi to take his pillow and deliver a shift hit to Lu Guang's face; resulting in the two fighting over the pillow until they were in a tangle of limbs and body parts.

A few moments of silence passed by until a chuckle escaped from Lu Guang's lips upon seeing how messy Cheng Xiaoshi's hair had become. He was unable to stop the chuckle from building and turning into a fit of laughter; his cheeks growing sore and his eyes almost seemed to shimmer with unshed tears. 

It wasn't long before both of them were laughing away and basking in their happiness.

""Hey, Lu Guang."" Cheng Xiaoshi asks once they had managed to finally restrain themselves; snuggling together on the bottom bunk.

He lets out a sleepy hum in response.

""Have we still got the appointment at the shelter?""

""Yeah. Why?""

""We really should go. You went through all that effort and I want to see this through to the end."" Cheng Xiaoshi states and it only took a single look at his boyfriend to know that he was serious. ""I mean, we have more than enough to keep two cats entertained.""

""Are you sure?""

""Course I am! When we had Elizabeth, you were a perfect mummy!""

Lu Guang ruffles at Cheng Xiaoshi's hair; causing the last strands finally being freed from the hair tie and awakening a warm giggle to be released from his boyfriend.

""I was just messing, Guang Guang~ Please go easy on me~"" He muses before burrowing into Lu Guang's chest.  

""Not in a million years."" He declares. ""If I went easy on you, for even a second, who knows what you'd do.""

It didn't take long until they had both fallen asleep and, after a quick call from the vets to enquire whether they would be able to adopt the kitten, they were at the local shelter.

The paperwork had taken a fair amount of time and, after Cheng Xiaoshi spent a few minutes hunting for his passport, they were finally given the chance to see all the pets on offer.

Cheng Xiaoshi had taken it upon himself to look at every single animal they had and Lu Guang kept his attention away from his boyfriend; knowing that if he looked at him then he would be greeted with puppy dog eyes and a plead for them to adopt all the animals they had at the shelter.

It lasted until they both settled their eyes upon a certain cat that had crystal blue eyes and thick fur in a number of different brown tones. They would have looked majestic if it wasn't for how they had decided to take residence on the stretching pose; half hanging over the edge and stretched out as far as it could go.

They only needed to share a look to know that they had found the cat they both desperately wanted to adopt.

Having decided when they would be able to collect their new resident, the duo returned home and Lu Guang had taken it upon himself to take out every piece of equipment needed out of storage. Cheng Xiaoshi had attempted to offer his assistance but was quickly turned out and promptly turned away; his boyfriend ordering him to keep himself busy by making sure that everything was ready for the clients that would be coming in tomorrow. 

He had left with a pout and, every so often, would glance at Lu Guang to see him vigorously cleaning all the items he had gotten out. It was nice to see them getting put to use again and Cheng Xiaoshi knew that, no matter how hard Lu Guang tried to convince him otherwise, he missed taking care of Elizabeth. 

This wasn't going to be the same as when they took care of Elizabeth but, he knew that they would do an amazing job... At least he knew Lu Guang would at the very least.

As soon as he had finished putting away the envelopes now filled with developed photographs, Cheng Xiaoshi paced back to his boyfriend; wrapped his arms around his shoulders and leaning on him. Lu Guang let out a huff but made no effort in shrugging him off.

""Did you do everything I asked you to do?""

""All sorted and put away!"" Cheng Xiaoshi happily declared before snuggling into Lu Guang a little more. ""I can see you've been hard at work for when our children will come home.""

""Chil-"" Lu Guang spluttered out; a deep red blush burst across his face and reached the tips of his ears. ""Y-yes... I have been.""

""Come on, Guang Guang~ You should be ready for this by now!"" Cheng Xiaoshi mused as he glanced at all the different items that had been spread out; noting that the exposed outlets had been covered by flat plugs. ""Look at how clean everything is!""

""One of us had to do it."" Lu Guang mumbled before pushing his boyfriend off his back and clearing his throat. 

Cheng Xiaoshi folds his arms as he lets out an overdramatic gasp. ""I wanted to help but someone said no.""

""If you had helped, you would have gotten distracted and not properly cleaned.""

""Wh- No I wouldn't!"" He retorts with a pout. ""I would have done my very best to make sure that this photo studio was the perfect home for our furry children!""

Lu Guang spares him a look before letting out a sigh and making his way towards the front of the building and around the counter. He takes a look at one of the shelves and notices a rather messy pile of envelopes. All he needed to do was spare a look at Cheng Xiaoshi for his boyfriend to back down.

""I still got everything ready, didn't I?"" He mumbles before dropping onto the nearby couch. 

""I suppose you did."" Lu Guang replies before removing the phone from it's mount on the wall. ""Pizza?""

At the mention of pizza, Cheng Xiaoshi's mood almost immediately improved as he rapidly nodded his head with a wide grin.

It didn't take long for their food to arrive and Cheng Xiaoshi happily indulged in the meat feast pizza his boyfriend had ordered for him; barbeque sauce coating his fingers. Lu Guang had even allowed him a slice of his own pizza once he had devoured every single piece of his own; his boyfriend's puppy dog eyes having been almost impossible to ignore.

After having wiped Cheng Xiaoshi's face with a damp cloth, and making sure that he had cleaned his hands, the duo made their way upstairs and released they were faced with the task of tidying their bedroom. 

Lu Guang didn't even need to look at his boyfriend to know that he was looking at him.

""Fine. You can help this time."" He stated and couldn't help but smile when Cheng Xiaoshi let out a joyful cheer. 

""What do you want me to do?"" 

""I want you to put your clothes away and put the dirty ones in the basket."" Lu Guang stated before rolling up his sleeves and ignoring how the other reacted to his request. 

Night time had fully arrived by the time every room in the building was up to standard; Lu Guang having made sure that every possibility was taken into account for when the cats would be home. He had even made sure that the remaining carrier was waiting at the entrance for when they went to pick up the elder one of their children.

Now they were both laying in the bottom bunk; far too tired to climb up the ladders and clamber into the top bunk.

""Cheng Xiaoshi."" Lu Guang mumbles softly as his boyfriend snuggles up against his; face pressed into his chest as his arms held him close and his legs intertwined with Lu Guang's own.

He only let out a sleepily mumble in response.

""I want to tell you something... Before we pick them up."" He informs his boyfriend, running his fingers through his hair.

Cheng Xiaoshi slowly pries himself away from their embrace to look at him with half-closed eyes.

""I know you keep joking about it but, really, I think you would make a wonderful Dad.""

Lu Guang watches as Cheng Xiaoshi gazes down at him; the words processing in his mind as if he had been given a new puzzle to solve.

""I..."" He attempts to begin before halting for a few moments and glancing away from the other. 

Lu Guang lets his boyfriend take his time to come up with an answer; carefully pulling him down and returning to their previous position.

He had thought Cheng Xiaoshi had fallen asleep but, after a few minutes of silence, he finally spoke up.

""You really think so?"" He asks with a soft voice; his words unstable and a little wobblily. 

""I've been with you for a while now and I know you would."" Lu Guang clarifies warmly. ""Now, get some sleep so we can be ready for a busy day tomorrow.""

He feels Cheng Xiaoshi nod his head before he nestles into him; breath steading as he dozes off.

Lu Guang finds himself remaining awake for a little longer, listening to his boyfriends gentle snores as he mentally prepares for the next day.

***

By the time the sun had begun to rise in the sky, Cheng Xiaoshi had taken it upon himself to wake Lu Guang up by frantically rushing around their bedroom in an attempt to find every article of clothing he had taken off last night; not even attempting to debate on whether he should put something clean on or stick to yesterdays clothes.

Before Lu Guang could even attempt to fall back to sleep, his boyfriend flopped onto him with a cheerful chuckle; now fully dressed and ready to pick up their furry children. Cheng Xiaoshi would be going to the shelter to pick up the elder cat whilst Lu Guang would be returning to the vets and collecting the kitten as he had a few questions he wanted to ask.

No matter how much Cheng Xiaoshi had pestered his boyfriend into letting him tag along, the two appointments were just too close to one another and Lu Guang knew that Cheng Xiaoshi would be too late even if he attempted to join him at the vets.

Pushing a rather giddy Cheng Xiaoshi off of him, Lu Guang finally began to get ready for the day; running a hand through his messy hair as he let out a tired yawn. Even if he didn’t need to be ready for another few hours, he knew Cheng Xiaoshi wasn’t going to let him close his eyes for longer than necessary.

Luckily for a rather tired Lu Guang, Cheng Xiaoshi’s energetic and hyper mood followed his boyfriend when he quickly paced down the stairs and sped out the building; only once Lu Guang had made sure that he’d packed everything he needed.

After making himself a couple slices of toast, Lu Guang took it upon himself to go to the nearest pet shop that had been given high marks on their Google page. He knew that he couldn’t have brought his boyfriend with him otherwise they would have spent more than a few hours staring at all the different fish and commenting on all the little accessories one could put inside their bowls.

With a gentle smile, Lu Guang allowed himself to look at the fish tanks before carefully looking at all the different types of pet food on offer. Even if he had decided to serve them different types of meals, he knew that a few bags of kibble would be necessary.

Once he had calculated the exact amount this would cost him, Lu Guang made his way to the counter and quietly paid for everything; reluctantly responding to the small talk the server was providing him with.

As he carried the large bags stuffed the the brim with many different items Lu Guang had ended up buying, part of him wished that he had asked Cheng Xiaoshi to join him but, he managed to make it back home to drop off the items; almost immediately leaving and making his way to the vets.

After telling the receptionist his name and sitting inside a rather small waiting room, Lu Guang was seen to by a rather friendly vet. They carefully opened the carrier door to reveal a sleeping kitten whose white fur looked extremely soft to the touch and, sadly, one of their ears looked rather mangled. Even so, Lu Guang thought that the kitten was extremely adorable and couldn’t help but feel like this was meant to be.

He gazed at his new furry child before turning his attention to the vet and ensuring that every question he had thought about was asked; mentally noting everything they said and wishing he had brought a notebook to write everything down.

Eventually, the kitten was coming home with him and, by the time Lu Guang had gotten home, Cheng Xiaoshi could be spotted playing with the other cat. He saw as the cat chased after a small toy mouse, which had been tied to stick with a long piece of string, that his boyfriend kept twirling about.

”I’m back.” Lu Guang announced before carefully putting the carrier on the counter. Cheng Xiaoshi almost immediately rushed over to him and gazed into the container that was holding their kitten.

“Welcome home.” He smiles before placing a kiss on Lu Guang’s cheek. “I know you said you wanted to name them after we thought about it some more but…”

“But?”

”I wanna call this one Warhammer.”

”N-“

”Please!” Cheng Xiaoshi interrupts before, after noting how he had raised his voice a little too loudly, sheepishly clearing his throat. “You got to name Elizabeth so it’s only fair.”

“Wait… let me get this straight.” Lu Guang began, resisting the urge to sigh. “You want to name our fluffy little kitten, Warhammer?”

“Yep!” Cheng Xiaoshi beams with an enthusiastic nod of his head. “I think it suits them.”

After looking at his boyfriend for a few moments, he lets out a sigh and picks up the carrier once again; noting that the other cat had joined them and was now circling around Cheng Xiaoshi’s legs.

”Fine but I’m naming our other child.” He remarks as he makes his way up the stairs; hearing a rather enthusiastic cheer as he makes his way into their bedroom.

***

A few days pass by and everything was going great until Cheng Xiaoshi, having gone to to get some kisses from his boyfriend, had left the door open and hadn’t realised that Warhammer was following after him.

He didn’t even realise that their youngest was with him until the kitten scampered across the floor and almost immediately snuggled into Anastasia. The other cat paused but, after sniffing the cute kitten, wasn’t opposed to Warhammer’s presence. In fact, it was quite the opposite.

With a shared look between each other, Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi knew that adopting their furry children was the best decision they’d made… And that Cheng Xiaoshi was extremely lucky as things could have gone so very wrong.

Holy shit. Has anyone else experienced this. It’s not an illness nor food poisoning. Definitely stopping the gluten challenge.

These things deserve a Purple Heart.

Here’s the rundown of their battle history:

1. The Bucket Baptism
First water encounter: They fell into a full bucket of water. My panic was so intense I almost pushed them further in trying to grab them. Somehow… they kept working like nothing happened.

2. The Rain Incident
Months later, they got soaked in the rain. They were glitchy and barely usable for nearly a week. I was about to give up, but decided to clean them myself and let them sit, boom, they bounced back to life.

3. The Coffee Spill Catastrophe
Next up: coffee, not just water, but that sweet, acidic brew. Splashed on them during a near disaster involving my MacBook. MacBook survived, AirPods were hit, and again, they pulled through.

4. The Rattle and The Wall
Just recently, they developed the infamous rattling issue (common with 1st gens). Noise cancelling and audio quality dropped. I was about to give up… then I told myself: “well they’re already kind of dead. 50/50 they get totaled or fixed” and threw them straight against the wall.

Not kidding — that fixed it.

Now? Noise cancelling, transparency mode, Spatial Audio, everything works like new. No more rattle. I don’t recommend it, but hey, sometimes brute force works.

The Aftermath
These things have:
	•	Survived submersion, rain, and coffee
	•	Been cleaned, dried, and handled with love (and sometimes rage)
	•	Been physically assaulted and came back better


I plan to grab the AirPods Max soon and retire these beasts to gym duty, where they’ll probably outlive the barbell too.

Moral of the story?
Apple stuff ain’t cheap, but damn, they’re built like tanks.

also, i've been waking up at exactly 6:20 am every day. why.

yesterday, nothing was wrong. that may have had something to do with the fact that it was my birthday (the big two oh!) and i was offered my dream job (hospital transporter) at an amount of money that was practically staggering compared to my previous jobs ($18.50 per hour, not a tip jar in sight). pretty good day; wifey and i went to target and came home with kermit.

today, i woke up feeling like shit (at 6:20) and have not stopped. i've been vaguely nauseous, my throat kinda itches from all the screaming i did after that job offer phone call, and i have not had the will to do literally anything beyond mindlessly scrolling. i tried to at least watch something long-form to slow the effects of brain-frying, maybe motivate myself to clean while wifey was out there working hard. put on a cozy vlog cleaning video. the lady was wearing a gym set. she turned around and the sight of her behind made me sharply more nauseous immediately, for some goddamn reason. then i noticed the walls were white in her apartment, and the concept of modern minimalist design pissed me off so much i had to turn the video off.

mind you, i am not generally an irritable person; i haven't felt this high-strung since baby's first boy juice. all this and my focus has literally not improved at all. 

i am told that this will take a bit to even out, but honestly i feel like hell. i will give it another two weeks to at least start showing some improvement, but i start my new job in early june and i refuse to financially burden my wife for longer than i have to.

1kjj92k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1kjj92k/a_desperate_call_for_help/,A desperate call for help?,"**Hi everyone,**

I was diagnosed with IBS years ago—by at least eight different gastroenterologists.
I'm writing this post in the hope of finding some kind of help... though honestly, I don’t have much hope left.

I’ve seen many doctors over time, all of them gastro specialists. After ruling out every possible condition with test results that always came back perfect, they landed on IBS as a diagnosis by exclusion. But after that, they basically stopped caring. They downplayed everything, looked at me like I was either exaggerating or just being dramatic. No one really tried to help.

---

**MY SYMPTOMS:**

* Intense abdominal cramps, usually in the lower left side
* Strong and repeated urgency to use the bathroom
* General abdominal discomfort
* Bloating
* Gas

Not all symptoms show up at once, and even on my ""good"" days, I always feel some level of abdominal discomfort.
The main issues are the abdominal pain and, more than anything, the urgency—when I have to go, it’s *now*.

Worth noting: I usually don’t have diarrhea.

---

**MEDICAL TESTS I’VE DONE:**

* Multiple blood tests → always perfect, all values well within normal range
* Stool tests and cultures → negative
* Fecal calprotectin → normal
* Multiple full abdominal ultrasounds → always clean and perfect
* Crohn’s disease testing → negative
* SIBO test → negative
* Autoimmune disorder screening → negative
* Lactose/lactulose/gluten intolerance tests → all negative

---

**TREATMENTS I’VE TRIED:**

* Antispasmodics (trimebutine maleate)
* Antispasmodics with benzodiazepines (Octatropine methyl bromide + diazepam)
* Low-dose amitriptyline (15mg)
* VSL#3 probiotics
* Rifaximin
* Vitamin D
* Various gas-relief pills (charcoal-based and similar—not really memorable or effective)
* FODMAP diet (strict elimination phase)

---

**CURRENT TREATMENT:**

* Amitriptyline 15mg + 1 VSL#3 daily (the amitriptyline *might* be helping a bit, but I’ve only been on it for about a month, so too soon to say for sure)
* Following the FODMAP diet religiously (strict phase, no reintroductions yet, using Monash University app)
* No coffee or caffeine
* Gluten-free
* Lactose-free
* No alcohol
* No fried foods

---

**HOW IT AFFECTS MY LIFE:**

Over the past few years, this condition has become unmanageable. It’s completely ruined any sense of possibility in my life. It affects my relationships, my academic path, and leaves me with no hope for a career. Honestly, it makes me long for “that thing that brings eternal rest.”

I have daily symptoms. I used to love dressing up, even for casual outings, but for over a year now I’ve stopped wearing chinos, jeans, dress shirts, jackets, leather belts—anything that puts pressure on my stomach. I only wear joggers and hoodies now. That alone makes me incredibly sad because dressing well used to be a real passion of mine.

I can’t eat out or go to pubs with friends or my girlfriend—I can’t order anything.
I often have to turn down invitations, even for something simple like a walk in the park or a quick trip to the shops, because I feel too unwell. Sometimes I have to head home immediately due to pain or bathroom urgency.

I’ve quit anything that could stress me out. I used to love competitive gaming and was pretty good at it, but I gave it up, thinking it might be contributing to the stress.

Naturally, this situation causes massive problems in my personal relationships. It also wrecks my ability to study—I can’t focus—and there’s no way I could hold down a job. My condition just wouldn’t allow me to be consistent or reliable.

There’s much more I could say, but I think this gives a good idea of how completely this has shut down my life.

Thanks to anyone who made it this far. I sincerely hope no one reading this is going through the same thing.",2,1746908101.0,ibs,2,1.0,False

Raised on an Oklahoma farm with three older brothers, Trish never quite learned the polished graces of city life. Her tall, slender frame and unassuming looks earned her teasing growing up, but behind the shy glances and nervous laughs is a woman eager to connect and make someone’s day a little brighter. Whether she’s balancing a tray of coffee cups or stealing glances from behind the counter, Trish’s blend of sweetness and sincerity will leave you wondering how you ever settled for small talk and surface smiles.

She’s not flashy, and she’s never been the center of attention — but take the time to get to know her, and you’ll find a loyal companion who’ll stick by you long after the dishes are cleared. If you’re looking for honesty, warmth, and the quiet thrill of a woman who doesn’t realize just how captivating she is, Trish Binford is ready to meet you — apron, coffee pot, and hopeful heart in hand.
