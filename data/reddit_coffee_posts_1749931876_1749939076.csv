1lbki5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1lbki5g/the_gravity_of_us/,The Gravity of Us,"Life is cruel, weaving destinies with threads of longing and loss. You, my dear, are the most beautiful tragedy—an impossible love written in the margins of fate. From the moment you stumbled into my orbit, I knew the stars had miscalculated, had placed you just far enough away to torture me with what-ifs.

You were always too distant, yet I felt you in the marrow of my bones. Your voice—just words on a screen—became the rhythm of my heart. Every message was an inhale of hope, every silence an exhale of despair. I built a sanctuary out of your laughter, found courage in the way you spoke my name.

Everywhere I looked, you lingered. The sunsets bled with your warmth, the rain carried echoes of your touch, the wind whispered the syllables of your existence. The mundane became sacred—an empty coffee cup, a song playing in the background, a city I walked alone. Everything was a reminder that you were there and not there, everywhere and nowhere.

We were a mistake of time, a collision meant for another life. Perhaps fate grew reckless, gifting us love only to take it away. But what bitter irony it is—to find something so rare, so soul-deep, only to watch it slip through grasping fingers.

You made me dream of futures that felt like stolen glimpses into paradise. But dreams are fragile, and now I wake to the hollow absence of you. The distance is agonizing, the yearning unbearable—but if pain is the cost of loving you, I will endure it a thousand times over.

So what do we do? We survive. We keep breathing through the ache, keep writing chapters in a story that refuses to end. We hold onto stolen moments, to whispered midnight confessions, to the undeniable truth that we were never meant to forget each other.

And when the longing threatens to break me, I remind myself—this is not the end. The universe cannot be so cruel as to write our final page before we have truly lived. Somewhere, in a future too beautiful to imagine, our paths will collide once more.

So let’s keep writing—one word at a time—until fate finds mercy and brings you home.",1,1749938949.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

We first met in that classic I-4 traffic—congested one second, wide open the next. You were in a black Buick, and I was in a rush. But unlike most drivers who close every inch of space in front of them, you did something rare: you flashed your lights and actually made space so I could pass. Not once, but multiple times.

Before I knew it, we were kind of working together leapfrogging cars, opening gaps for one another, zigzagging through traffic like a team. Then you disappeared. You took off on the right and I couldn’t follow, and for a good half hour I was pushing 100 mph trying to catch up. I thought I lost you.

But then boom there you were again.

I passed you on the right when traffic backed up, and a few minutes later, I slowed down, wondering if you were still back there. Sure enough, you showed up again two cars behind me. We took the same exit onto I-75 heading toward Wesley Chapel. I let you pass, and we exchanged smiles and a salute.

You kept weaving through traffic like before, and I followed from a distance. Near exit 279, my exit, you popped up again. I couldn’t believe you were taking the same exit as me after 60-70 miles on the road! We were side by side. We smiled, nodded one final time… and then went our separate ways. You turned right, I turned left.

Man, I’ll remember that drive for a loong time. I could genuinely tell how nice of a person you are and definitely one of the best drivers out there!

1lbkd73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lbkd73/my_parents_hate_me_and_idk_what_to_do/,My parents hate me and idk what to do,"Okay so basically my parents severely hate me (Male 19) for everything I do and are constantly frustrated at me over everything . I will list some of their grievances they have with me and some I have with them. I want advice on how I should change while also not completely being a doormat for them (I feel they expect this sometimes ) and some situations . I feel very ostracized by them 

1) my little brother is took my belt and I did not know he had this. I looked all over for it and for a month did not find it. I was than looking online for a new belt when I saw him wearing it. I said “that’s my belt give it back” and my father was there, he sided with my brother. Saying essentially “you do not pay rent nor do you buy food so why can’t you just buy your own” (I’m not doing direct quotes bc he was mainly cursing at me ) .  I did not get the belt back until after he was done wearing it but my father was still upset 

These next few segments are all about food and they say I am weird about food. Which maybe, my expectations are they are my parents and I live with them so they would in theory get me something . They never have said they expect me to pay for their food though. I will sometimes bring my mother lunches or order food for my dad but this is when they request me too. Occasionally if it is not urgent like my mom’s lunch at work or anything I will just say no to getting them food . 

2) they want me to drive them places , and usually I do not want too. Example.. mother wants me to drive her to coffee shop, says we are going and includes my sister and brother. We get there, she says she is not going to get me a drink, okay I guess. She than goes in and looks at stuff on display and I just wait for them. She was frustrated I expected something in return for driving her at all. My thought process was it was a food place so that’s why she wanted me to take her (to be fair to her she was drinking earlier in the day so she couldn’t drive)

2.5) driving again, my dad wanted me to drive and pick up everyone food, this is because earlier in the day I had asked him if he wanted food. He said to ask my mom, who said she would see , who never got back to me after an hour, so I already ate a few snacks. So once he asked me “do you want food” I said not really . He than flipped out saying what about the rest of them ? And I was selfish for not driving for them. Than they all got in the car and got food without me than ate it in front of me

3) I do not offer to buy them food when I am out even tho I buy myself food. My mom said I should be texting and asking if anyone wants food instead of just bringing home food for myself . She mentioned me and my friend getting sandwiches and eating them at the house as rude.

I can definitely see where she is coming from here only recently she was told me she doesn’t like this tho 

4) I said I wanted to get a tattoo. My dad threatened to kick me out

5) I have a gf my father does not ideologically agree with (not trump supporter or racist btw just my dad is very anti government and she is neutral ) and will constantly bring up my relationship to mock me and talking about how she will die at war weird stuff like that. A week ago he was banging on my shower door to taunt me about it? Idk he asked what I was going after and I didn’t know why why but I just said I was just showering and he kept going 

6) he would not do his tax returns for my fasfa and I had to keep pestering him for months until finally I had to turn in the fasfa without his tax returns and mark it as needed or whatever. He was mocking me and taunting me about it and I said he was a bad person for not doing this for me and he knew how important my financial aid was. He said I was stupid for thinking not doing taxes made him a bad person and who cares abt the government . I said I did not care about that aspect but the fact he did not do this for me even though he had months  was what bothered me. He kicked me out for 3 days and I just slept In my car lmao. Until my mom called and said I could come home and my brother made a mess of my room

7) brother went through my phone and messages and told my mother I said I loved my gf and stuff. This was bad because I hide personal things from them and my mother was upset with me after

8) my sister wasn’t taking care of her pet kitten and wanted to give it up . It made me said so I offered to take care of it but I already have a cat so have to get my male cat neutered before they can interact safely . The kittens fur was matted and it was poop ing watery so I spent the past two days trying to help it and my parents are getting frustrated at me telling me to just get rid of it. It has been a lot better and I have it safe from my male cat for now , it is hard to manage though and I feel like I might have to give up

This is just some stuff that happens within the past 3 ish months . And more stuff like this as occurred before. when I was younger my dad grounded me and threw water on me because I ate half a cookie that wasn’t mine. But that is besides the point. 
I think sometimes they are irrational and really mean to me , and I don’t want to be a push over for them to finally just be nice to me , but I don’t want to have to keep pushing back and have them eventually kick me out and they all hate me even more than they do now. I just try and avoid them in my room , but it’s getting really difficult for me too because it’s summer . Usually I would be at school than work than home for very little time .

I dont know what people’s reactions will be after seeing this but please try to be kind lol.

I 24F started seeing 26M less than a month ago. Overall we vibe and have pretty similar interests and he’s a smart guy type which i appreciate. i’m on my final year of uni and he’s doing his internship. And the reason im saying this, is because neither of us is too rich but i went through a harsh period financially for more or less a year that im finally out of, and now i finally get to go out, spend more etc to enjoy. We live in a big city, and im the adventurous type when it comes to going out as in i like trying new different places, new bars, restaurants , cinema etc and generally do it alone when there is no one to follow. I was excited when seeing this guy because i thought there is finally someone i like who’d get to share those activities with me. But the thing is, each time i suggest an activity or a place he immediately starts bringing up money and costs. Of course, i know he’s not at his best financially like i said, and we went to museums, parks and walking dates initially. Then it started going worse when there was one day i suggested a local (good) restaurant. When we were there let’s say, he made quite a reaction, refused to order any meal and just got a drink and couldnt stop complaining about how expensive it is (by the way it wasn’t, those were literally the average meal costs where i live, it just that it wasn’t the good deal student cheap type)  and even made us leave it earlier when i was actually having a good time sitting and talking. I felt  genuinely guilty, because i was the one who suggested the place after he asked me to. Ever since then, he admitted he doesn’t like going to do or buy ‘costly’ things, as he grew up in middle class family and extravagant things remind him of the rich not so nice people at his school. Which explained  kinda his reaction when we went to the place because it became clear it’s not just the cost idk?

Of course i respect the fact that he’s on a budget, but i feel like it’s getting worse ever since. We dont see each other too much those days so we agreed we could see each other just once a week for the time being. 2 days ago we went out and i let him choose the place, we had a very nice (part of the reason which im frustrated because i like spending time with him). Today we were talking about next plans for next times, and suddenly brings up the same issue again, that he’d like to coffees from now on or just get beers at the park and sit on the grass because we can’t get ‘big’ meals each time like that. Saying that from now on we’ll do that just once a week. I dont know, i got too irritated. Because well, i like doing that type of thing from time to time, but not all the time. I am the type of person who likes to dress well and do good makeup , go to good places and enjoy good things. Obviously it’s not just food and it’s not like i will die if i eat at home or cant go alone after uni to eat something’fancy’. But the thing is that it’s like that for each plan i suggest. Cinema? Too expensive but we can go once a month. Escape room ? Same thing. Amusement park ? Same thing over and over. I feel on edge now whenever i go out with him, because when on streets i cant even spontaneously choose a place to drink a beer because of that, we have to look up the cheap ones. I’m at a point where i just look forward to seeing my friends more because at least everyone orders their thing without talking about money every 2 seconds

I know he is not wrong, that he wants to respect his budget and that he just can’t sometimes. I really do respect that fact. But i’m just getting tired, especially when he mentions that the reason why is not that he doesn’t have money per se but that he’s doing savings because he doesn’t like to splurge according to him and that he saves to also pay off his school debt which again is too respectable except that he goes to a top school (hence the rich classmates thing) and that his salary once he graduates will probably so good that he wont have to worry too much about the debt? I know because i have a friend who now works and went to his same school also with a loan. I mean technically all of this is his business it’s just that i overall have a feeling that it’s not that he doesnt hve anything he just doesnt want to spend. He also explained to me that in his family and culture they are the type who’d go frugal in daily life just to afford the big and better things (likebig house, or good yearly vacations etc) and that he’s into that approach. Which for me made the thing even worse because i dont agree with this vision at all and it made the thing worse because it’s not just a temporary thing. I feel angry and a bit trapped, becauae when i met him i didnt even want a serious relationship i just went along because i liked him a lot.

So now i wanna know if im overracting? Also any advice on what i should do is appreciated im not stubborn and listen to good inputs

TLDR: im seeing a guy that i really like. I enjoy going to good restaurants or cinema or doing ‘fancy’, but he doesnt have too much money and prefers free or cheap places and says we should only do those once in a while. I’m starting to get too irritated over the issue because we dont agree on date ideas",1,1749938465.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1lbkc2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Generator/comments/1lbkc2c/generator_surging_under_load/,Generator Surging Under Load,"Hey all! New here. I've got a coffee trailer and I'm running a Westinghouse Igen11000 inverter. I'm having an issue where the generator surges consistently when a new load is applied. 700w microwave, espresso machine, etc. it should be able to handle this power but it surges until the load stops. For example, the espresso machine when fully warmed up is pulling between 600 and 1200 watts and fluctuates a lot to maintain the heating element temperature. This fluctuation causes the generator to hunt constantly. Up and down up and down. Shouldn't the generator be able to hand a fluctuation like that without revving up and down constantly? 

Same thing with the microwave though. That's a constant 700 watt load when on, but that's causing hunting up and down too. 

Anybody ever experienced this?

# What Makes Niacinamide Toothpaste Unique?

Niacinamide (also known as nicotinamide), a form of vitamin B3, is well-known in skincare for its brightening and restorative properties. When applied to dental care, it helps gently lift stains, reduce discoloration, and improve the overall appearance of your teeth without harsh abrasives.

# Key Benefits

* **Whiter, Brighter Teeth**: The formula works to gradually remove yellow stains from coffee, tea, wine, and tobacco, restoring your teeth’s natural whiteness.
* **Deep Cleaning Action**: Penetrates between teeth and along the gumline to eliminate plaque and food particles, helping prevent cavities and gum issues.
* **Fresh Breath All Day**: Infused with refreshing mint, this toothpaste neutralizes bad breath and leaves your mouth feeling clean and cool.

# Why Choose Niacinamide Whitening Toothpaste?

In an era where natural ingredients meet high-performance science, this toothpaste stands out by blending cosmetic benefits with essential oral health care. It’s ideal for daily use and especially beneficial for those who are looking for a gentle yet effective way to enhance their smile without sensitivity.

So I thought I’d give a small update since a lot of you suggested being direct rather than ghosting, just to see how he reacts and confirm my instincts.

To clarify: I had actually canceled our earlier plan by giving the excuse of “family commitments” because I was already feeling weird about the drinks thing, not just straight up stopped replying like some comments thought. But after reading the responses here, I decided to be more honest — for closure, if nothing else.

So when he called I said something like:
“We can try to meet next weekend if you’re still up for it, but I’d really prefer not to go for drinks”, I even suggested some of my favourite coffee spots 
His response?
	1.	He said he usually goes to the gym or works during the day so was hoping to meet a little later. Which… fine, that’s understandable since he does freelance work.
	2.	But then he followed it up with:
“But I bet you’d be very fun drunk”

Yeah.

That creeped me out more than I expected. Not only did it dismiss what I just said again, it also gave off the exact vibe I was trying to avoid — like the main appeal of the date was how I’d behave after drinking.

I ended up giving vague answers to his follow-ups and haven’t taken the conversation further. At this point, I’m pretty sure I’m not going to.",14,1749938155.0,AITAH,9,0.94,False

I’ve done it all. Literally.
	•	Rifaximin — no real improvement
	•	Herbal antimicrobials (biocidin, oregano, berberine, SF722, monolaurin)
	•	Fasting (36+ hour resets)
	•	Probiotic flares (L. reuteri ruined me — major SIBO flare from one capsule)
	•	Colon rebuilds (GI Revive, L-glutamine, zinc carnosine)
	•	Binder protocols (charcoal, zeolite, MCP)
	•	Prebiotics (acacia, PHGG, green tea, MCP)
	•	Vagus nerve work (gargling, humming, breathwork, IQoro)
	•	Coffee enemas, castor oil packs
	•	Diet: low FODMAP, low starch, low histamine, still bloated
	•	And I recently started:
	•	SEED probiotic
	•	Floraphage
	•	Iberogast
	•	DE (Diatomaceous Earth)

POSSIBLE MOLD?

This one scares me.
	•	1930s UK house, recently renovated
	•	White “mould plate” growths on agar tests in hallway
	•	IKEA PAX unit caused major reaction (itchy throat, coughing, sinus pressure)
	•	Now using air purifiers, removed wardrobe
	•	Still… some symptoms persist (morning congestion, phlegmy throat, itchiness in hallway)

I don’t know if I’m still in exposure, or if I’m just wrecked from past exposure. And I know mold + SIBO = hell.

HOW I FEEL NOW
	•	I’m beyond bloated — even rice or potatoes make me look 7 months pregnant
	•	I’m exhausted
	•	I don’t know what to eat
	•	I don’t know what’s working
	•	I’m scared the environment is sabotaging my healing
	•	I’m genuinely wondering: is this fixable?

MY ASK TO YOU
	•	Has anyone been here and actually recovered?
	•	Are there success stories from people with severe terrain collapse + mold + overgrowths?
	•	Am I doing the right thing by shifting from “killing” to rebuilding?
	•	Is SEED + Floraphage + DE + Iberogast a good path to finally move the bloat?
	•	What would YOU do if you were me?


This is the most honest thing I’ve written in two years of navigating this. I know terrain healing takes time. I know it’s not linear. But I also know that hope runs low when every day feels like you’re living in a broken machine.

If you’ve come back from this place — or have any perspective — please share it. I need it right now more than ever.

Thank you so much.",2,1749938134.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False
1lbk4r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1lbk4r4/my_roommate_thinks_all_women_are_is_mother/,my roommate thinks all women are is mother,"I (f25) live with a couple. (f29 & m28). We have lived together since last july and have one more year left on our lease-- there has been plenty of conversations and getting-to-know in that time frame. Additionally, f29, who we will call brandy, and i were friends previous to living together. this post nothing to do with her.

While this situation is far better than my previous roommate (another bad-roommates post for another time) it is eerily similar due to the fully grown 28+ year old men that have the mindset of a 10 to 13 year old living on their own.

I seriously think this guys brain stopped developing at middle school level. I am astounded by (what i believe is) purposeful ignorance. His inability to cook or shop for himself is incredible. You dont even have to love cooking to do it, its a skill used to feed yourself like an adult. The grocery store has SIGNS with numbers and labels that tell you where things are located-- why are you, a 28 year old man, calling your gf because ""there are no more rotisserie chickens, what do i do?"" go get a frozen pizza, baby man. modern problems require modern solutions. imagine.

Disclaimer: i am no saint. There are times i leave my clothes in the dryer for a few days, i may sometimes put the trash in the garage instead of taking it to the dumpster ), and occasionally ill leave a dish i the sink. Normal living human things that people do, saving the task to be done later. There is a method to how i function, everything has a purpose and a place. I am diagnosed OCD and am medicated for anxiety-- with this, i am exceptionally good at sorting and organizing. In fact, I LOVE organizing: i've done the fridge, freezer, kitchen cabinets, spice cabinet, and the pantry. I have always informed my roommates of this and have made it clear that if you need help finding something let me know, if there is anything you dont want thrown away, move it or tell me, and if i ever do anything that makes you feel some kind of way, let me know and lets talk about it. I prefer honesty and conversation over passive aggression.

In this scenario, i do believe myself to be a pretty damn good roommate.

Additional context: I have a 5 year old short hair gray tabby we will call corn. He is an absolute diva, but a well behaved one, nonetheless. tom & brandy have a dog. senior cattle dog of sorts;  also very well behaved. corn never leaves my room. He meows for me if he hears me in the kitchen or living room and can't see me. He goes to explore a little, but he's a big ole wuss puss. With that, I do not hang out in the living room or shared spaces, except the kitchen, as i cook a lot. Because my time is usually spent in my room and the kitchen, those are the spaces i focus on cleaning. I do not clean the living room or their game room, they're spaces neither me nor my cat occupy. Lets begin.

Lets start around Halloween. I would have been here 3 months by this point. I had started dating someone I met on a dating app, he was over frequently, but by no means daily. Only hanging out in my room, i figured a heads up that this person was coming over would be enough. I do not need to ask permission to have a guest in the space i share + pay for. It is just as much my house as it is toms. This was a request he had informed me of, and i told him no.  
I told him that a heads up is all they need  due to the statements above. I am not going to ask you permission to  let someone into my room. There are circumstances where i understand it may be inappropriate to have someone over, as long as it's known i can respect this. He apologized after i confronted him about being very rude to the person i was seeing and several talks from brandy.

It's insane that this grown ass man wants me to ""respect his house"" by asking PERMISSION from HIM to have someone over. Funny that he wanted respect. seeing as a persistent issue in this house is his disrespect for my space and things.

Lets start with my bedroom door. Remember, the bedroom in which my cat spends 99.9% of his time. I have a pet gate so their dog does not come into my room if i am not home. i like to leave the door open for Corn, just in case he wants to explore (he doesn't when the gate is up) . There has been several times where I have come home and my door is closed. Why? Asking brandy about it, she has no idea what im talking about. she works nights, tom and i work 9-5, brandy is rarely home at the same time as us. When i asked tom, hey, did you shut my door? he said yes. when asked for a reason, he  stated Corn was ""freaking out"" due to the vacuum... why are you vacuuming that close to my room? Corn hides under the bed when i vaccum my room... doesn't really make sense why he would ""freak out"" if he doesn't normally. He said it wouldn't happen again or he would re open my door if he closed it for cleaning purposes. (???)

I want it to be known that they both don't mind Corn going around the house as long as he doesn't tear up the couch or go into their room / bathroom. 100% understandable. My door is usually always open with no gate when im here, sometimes Corn feels brave and wanders out. I close their bathroom & bedroom doors to avoid him entering those areas. that is a boundary they set and i respect it. This is important later.

Rearranging my appliances/ cabinets/ random things in the house & aggressive cleaning. Jesus christ, and im the one with diagnosed OCD. This guy comes home from his blue collar job and immediately begins loudly rearranging random things in the house . The items include, but are not limited to: my coffee maker, the paper towel roll, bread or fruit on the counter, the hand and dish soap, the small step ladder we have, and the broom. The aggressive mopping is a frequent event as well, i'd say about once a week to bi weekly. It's exactly what it sounds like. aggressive mopping of the entire fucking house.

Let's talk about the kitchen. A previously stated i am the main dish doer of the household, though there are times when none of the dishes are mine, so i expect them to put them in the dishwasher if the sink is full. Most of the dishes being done are mine because of how often i cook. They are always taken care of that same day after i finish eating. With that, there has been a few occasions where I have come home from work and my dishes (pot, pan, but mainly tupperware) was left sprawled out on the kitchen table. At first i didnt say anything, thinking it was a one off. When it continued to happen i asked tom why he continued to not put my dishes away... he ""didn't know where they go"".

1. I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 365 DAYS MY MAN. WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK DO YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY GO? I have quite literally reorganized the kitchen cabinets and told them where things were located. He has lived with this same kitchen set up for a year previously to me moving in... i truly don't get it. if you're unsure, ask, like i told you to do as soon as i have moved in. its ok to ask for help brother.
2. open the cabinets and LEARN WHERE SHIT GOES.

This man voted in the last election. I hope by this point that statement scares you.

The queso incident. None of us eats each others food without asking. Granted, they rarely go grocery shopping so most of the food in our house is mine. One of the meals i planned for a week was nachos. I bought that jarred queso cheese & some tortilla chips that lived in the pantry. When i go to make nachos, why is my jar only half filled??? why is the seal broken on the jar lid??... someone ate my  god damn queso! Brandy rarely eats, though. I ruled her out easy because her and i are very good about asking before taking/ informing and replacing. i still asked, and she claimed she did not. Hey tom, did you eat my queso? denial. ok... well someone ate it, maybe someone broke in and decided to target just MY queso. did i mention the queso was in the pantry and not the fridge? everyone on gods green earth knows that shit will mold if you dont refrigerate it. brandy works in the food industry, she knows this.

MF ate my chips and queso and lied to my face. There were times i thought my food going missing was in my head: a cheese stick short, chip bags feel a bit lighter, i swear i had one more package of this snack... that feeling has since stopped due to the queso confrontation.

The only other suspect was dog, who was ruled out due to having no opposable thumbs. jar 1 dog 0.

The room. This is the current situation i am dealing with and the reason for this post.

Once upon a time, in december of 2024, tom calls me and says hey, we notice you spend a lot of time in your room and we dont want you to feel trapped. we're going to clean up this spare room thats used for storage and you can use it as an office. (I work from home.) WOO HOO! BONUS BEDROOM! Plans? make it a cozy hang out space for me and my cat or guests. PC, TV, wii. nice.

I have things in the room. kitchen items that i don't want to get rid of, documents, party supplies... random stuff. I bought some big plastic totes and put all of my belongings in them, stacked them up, and put them in the corner out of the way. It'll still be used for storage, but someone will inhabit the space.

Admittedly, i was not quick to make progress on that room. it took me until february and an excuse of ""spring cleaning"" to get on it. every month since, i have asked if they were still planning on cleaning up the room. tom never replied, brandy did. and brandy did make progress on the room recently. The only things left of theirs include random items and a large mountain of plushies. the large mountain of plushies has sad in that room since they moved into this house 2 years ago.

Tired of asking and with progress made by brandy, i started opening up the room so Corn had additional space to play. i set up the gate in the hall so he could go from room to room and the dog wouldn't be near him. Their space is on the other side of the hall, probably 5 feet from where the gate is. it is not blocking or bothering any parts of the house tom and brandy enter. If you guessed that he was closing the spare room door and moving my gate, you would be correct! i talked to brandy about it. she said she doesn't mind nor really care. Corn does not tear things up, except for carpet / rugs. his preferred chew toy is plastic. plus, this room was offered 6 months ago.

I came home again today with the door shut and gate moved. Do yall remember how i mentioned this was a previous issue? the conversations i have had with him about respecting my space and stuff? what the fuck, guy. i dont prefer text as a form of communications for these matters, however, i rarely see him and im tired. i did not cuss, i said please, and i tried to be as direct as possible without sounding mean. i guess he called me, but my phone was on silent so i didn't see it until hours later.

i came home from the store today and he was here. i went to ask him where brandy was. he did not look at me and responded ""bedroom."" i stood for a moment while he continued to not look at me, playing his game. i said ""are we gonna address anything?"" response ""its cleared out. its all yours."" (it's not) i asked if there was a reason he kept closing the door. ""Corn was tearing up the stuffed animals."" no, he wasn't. even if he was, they have sat in a pile on the floor for 2 years. you don't give a shit about them either, tom.

brandy doesn't think corn did this, either.

The sheer disrespect this guy potrays is insanity. he acts like a stubborn teenager who's mad at their mom. i told him later that when he is ready to have a conversation to iron everything out, let me know. with the nastiest look he stated ""sounds great.""

The room is not cleaned.

Honorable mentions include:

\-his complete lack of volume awareness. TV blasting CONSTANTLY and he FALLS ASLEEP TO IT. man, its 11PM on a wednesday, please turn the TV down its shaking my walls. are you deaf brother? this also includes when he is in voice chat with friends while gaming. Again, i work from home, and he screams and yells, sometimes even rage quits. Answering phones is part of my job. all of our texts are me asking him at late hours to quiet down, please.

EDIT; forgot this one: 

\-he came up to my room while i was working and asked if i was going to get the switch 2. i said no, i just built this PC why would i do that. He said ok well i was gonna tell  you not to because im getting one. All you would need to buy is a controller if you want to play it. Now... why TF would i spend $80 on joy cons for a console i do not even own. in what fucking world does that make sense? i told him i probably wont because it is not on my priority list. he tried to convince me that it WAS a priority so we could play mario kart. .\_.

\-one time he cooked an egg and somehow managed to dirty two pans. One of which had egg all over the outside of it, crusted brown on the pan from being burnt by our gas stove. HOW did you do that?

\-telling me that i would have to ""help him"" find a plushie net or something for the mountain in the spare room. this includes other things to like place recomendations, grocery store items, etc,.

If you made it this far, thanks. there are several more instances but i think this is what i needed off my chest. i will update if a conversation ever happens. I expect him to continue ignoring me and pretending i dont exist like he has been though. my friend has a theory that he has a crush on me. i know his demenor is probably due to the lack of control he has over me. MASSIVE CONTROL FREAK.

Am i being dramatic? brandy and i get along and communicate find i think. I do feel bad that shes caught in the middle. i told her to take it up with me if he starts talking to her about his issues. obviously i have attempted this with him and his inability to respect my space continues.",2,1749937901.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False

Excuse me if this is a bit vulgar or gross.

  


My girlfriend and I were on a trip, stayed in a hotel and there was only one bathroom.

  


She got in there before me in the morning, but I really had to go… I tried to say something a bit after the bathroom door closed, about if I can use it first, but she said too late and was talking in a joking way (she probably didn’t realize how much I had to go).

  


I waited for a while but when it was getting extra bad I knocked on the door and asked if I could use the bathroom, that I really had to use the bathroom.

  


She screamed at first.  I think she was startled.  She said no, she just got out of the shower and needs to do her makeup.

  


I said there is a mirror in the bedroom for that and she cut me off saying she has all her makeup set up on the counter and it’s better lighting in the bathroom.

  


I tried to say but I won’t be long, not sure I can wait.  I tried to play it off lightly but I made her know I was serious.  I wouldn’t have knocked unless it was.  She just ignored me.

I was not really dressed to leave the place or feeling well not having shaven or anything yet.  But I get dressed, trying not to accidentally relieve myself… while moving around to get dressed… if you know what I mean.

  


I go to the lobby but there is no bathroom there.  I assumed there would be.  How is that even possible?  I think about a coffee shop or something but not sure what is near but then I really worry!  I almost lost control there in the lobby.  So I hurry back up to the room and immediately to the bathroom door.  My girlfriend is still in there.

  


I bang a little harder this time.  And she gets really angry.  She even screams a bit telling me to leave her alone!  I told her I really have to go.  I lose a bit of the polite euphemisms at this point and say I have to use the toilet badly, I’m going to lose control.

  


She says she won’t be much longer.  But at this point, she’s been in there almost an hour!  

  


An hour?  Really?  I mean if I didn’t have to use the bathroom, okay take your time getting ready and I can do other things, but come on…

I try to pace around, I try to think of other things.  And it’s getting really hard.  It hits the hour mark, even passes it by a couple minutes I think.  She is hearing me groaning I’m sure.  

  


I start to hear her hair dryer.  Not sure if she is really using that or just trying to drown me out.  

  


And I’m losing control.  I go a bit in my pants, number 2.  And it’s sort of just coming now, nothing I can do.  Maybe I have a lapse of insanity or something for a moment, but I take off my jeans and I just finish there on the floor, and even push the rest of it out.  Right there on the floor, by the door of the bathroom.  I try my best not to let out too much 1, but some 1 comes out, and a lot of 2, right threre by the door.  The hair dryer I think was going the whole time.

  


I don’t know if I should say the rest, but AITAH for going on the carpet like that?  It really changed the whole trip after that point, especially after she learned what had happened.  She seemed to even flirt with another guy at the place we went to later that evening.  I think me going on the floor like that really turned her off a bit.",1,1749937793.0,AITAH,2,0.57,False

I dont know what people’s reactions will be after seeing this but please try to be kind lol.

I 24F started seeing 26M less than a month ago. Overall we vibe and have pretty similar interests and he’s a smart guy type which i appreciate. i’m on my final year of uni and he’s doing his internship. And the reason im saying this, is because neither of us is too rich but i went through a harsh period financially for more or less a year that im finally out of, and now i finally get to go out, spend more etc to enjoy. We live in a big city, and im the adventurous type when it comes to going out as in i like trying new different places, new bars, restaurants , cinema etc and generally do it alone when there is no one to follow. I was excited when seeing this guy because i thought there is finally someone i like who’d get to share those activities with me. But the thing is, each time i suggest an activity or a place he immediately starts bringing up money and costs. Of course, i know he’s not at his best financially like i said, and we went to museums, parks and walking dates initially. Then it started going worse when there was one day i suggested a local (good) restaurant. When we were there let’s say, he made quite a reaction, refused to order any meal and just got a drink and couldnt stop complaining about how expensive it is (by the way it wasn’t, those were literally the average meal costs where i live, it just that it wasn’t the good deal student cheap type)  and even made us leave it earlier when i was actually having a good time sitting and talking. I felt  genuinely guilty, because i was the one who suggested the place after he asked me to. Ever since then, he admitted he doesn’t like going to do or buy ‘costly’ things, as he grew up in middle class family and extravagant things remind him of the rich not so nice people at his school. Which explained  kinda his reaction when we went to the place because it became clear it’s not just the cost idk? 

Of course i respect the fact that he’s on a budget, but i feel like it’s getting worse ever since. We dont see each other too much those days so we agreed we could see each other just once a week for the time being. 2 days ago we went out and i let him choose the place, we had a very nice (part of the reason which im frustrated because i like spending time with him). Today we were talking about next plans for next times, and suddenly brings up the same issue again, that he’d like to coffees from now on or just get beers at the park and sit on the grass because we can’t get ‘big’ meals each time like that. Saying that from now on we’ll do that just once a week. I dont know, i got too irritated. Because well, i like doing that type of thing from time to time, but not all the time. I am the type of person who likes to dress well and do good makeup , go to good places and enjoy good things. Obviously it’s not just food and it’s not like i will die if i eat at home or cant go alone after uni to eat something’fancy’. But the thing is that it’s like that for each plan i suggest. Cinema? Too expensive but we can go once a month. Escape room ? Same thing. Amusement park ? Same thing over and over. I feel on edge now whenever i go out with him, because when on streets i cant even spontaneously choose a place to drink a beer because of that, we have to look up the cheap ones. I’m at a point where i just look forward to seeing my friends more because at least everyone orders their thing without talking about money every 2 seconds

I know he is not wrong, that he wants to respect his budget and that he just can’t sometimes. I really do respect that fact. But i’m just getting tired, especially when he mentions that the reason why is not that he doesn’t have money per se but that he’s doing savings because he doesn’t like to splurge according to him and that he saves to also pay off his school debt which again is too respectable except that he goes to a top school (hence the rich classmates thing) and that his salary once he graduates will probably so good that he wont have to worry too much about the debt? I know because i have a friend who now works and went to his same school also with a loan. I mean technically all of this is his business it’s just that i overall have a feeling that it’s not that he doesnt hve anything he just doesnt want to spend. He also explained to me that in his family and culture they are the type who’d go frugal in daily life just to afford the big and better things (likebig house, or good yearly vacations etc) and that he’s into that approach. Which for me made the thing even worse because i dont agree with this vision at all and it made the thing worse because it’s not just a temporary thing. I feel angry and a bit trapped, becauae when i met him i didnt even want a serious relationship i just went along because i liked him a lot. 

So now i wanna know if im overracting? Also any advice on what i should do is appreciated im not stubborn and listen to good inputs

TLDR: im seeing a guy that i really like. I enjoy going to good restaurants or cinema or doing ‘fancy’, but he doesnt have too much money and prefers free or cheap places and says we should only do those once in a while.

1lbk212,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/1lbk212/recap_7_yellowstone_days_with_kids_the_good_the/,"Recap - 7 Yellowstone days with kids. The good, the bad and the ugly!","Flying home after an incredible yet exhausting trip and will recap as much as I can in the event that it might help someone with planning in the future.

We were coming from the east coast and didn't do a ton of research until a couple days before. We have 3 boys ages 6-9. I'd consider us relatively adventurous and we push the kids pretty hard - they are accustomed to it at this point.

One year ahead of time I booked 3 nights in a two bedroom cabin at Mammoth Lodge followed by 3 nights at the Old Faithful Inn and rented a minivan (the minivan was nearly $1000 but only went up as time went on.)

Day 0: We flew into Bozeman, landed mid afternoon and decided to hike up to the M the ""hard way"" which was a very fun but short hike. Terrible bugs. Lesson 1: bug spray. Stayed at a local Marriott property and hit the local grocery store for some supplies (mostly PB&J.)

Day 1: Hotel breakfast, drove to Mammoth, walked the hot springs. Had received a tip to use GuideAlong which was new to me. We will ALWAYS use it in the future. I would say it made our trip unmeasurably more worthwhile and many of the things we ended up doing were a direct result of the app. Hiked about 2 miles around the hot springs.

Lots of excitement, energy and time on our hands so we ended up the entire upper loop with some short stops. Hiked the porcelain basin, great intro to the park. Saw some bison, a black bear and a grizzly with cubs.

Side note: Junior ranger program is an absolute favorite of the kids. We have done several now and it really engages them, plus they love collecting badges. 

Checked into Mammoth. Room was very adequate although the shared bathroom along (especially having to go outside to get there) will always be an inconvenience. 

Lesson 2. Nearly all food at Yellowstone is expensive and poor quality. The terrace grill at Mammoth was the first of many $100 meals where we left thoroughly disappointed. It's hardly worth going into because it was so bad but I'll make a few more notes as I go along.

Day 2: Up at dawn, drove through Lamar Valley with a plan to get breakfast in Silver Gate. Fantastic drive, endless wildlife and one of my personal highlights. On arrival at Silver Gate, discovered there was no breakfast available and the spot I planned on was closed on Mondays. Not all bad news as we found moose just beyond the town. Very lucky! Luckily I had a stash of PB&J and we drove back through Lamar.

Afternoon was rafting on the Yellowstone river. First a stop at Yellowstone Pizza in Gardiner. Expensive and not good. A theme! 

Rafting was excellent, had a beautiful day for it and was a 10/10 experience for the kids. Highly recommended and may be a core memory from the trip.

Dinner at Yellowstone Perk - our first taste of good food. Nice options and kids enjoyed it too. 

Day 3: Our first big decision - we started to feel like we were falling behind on the main events so we spent the entire day on the west side of the park and worked our way down to Old Faithful even knowing that we were going back the next day. This ended up being a very good decision. We started with the breakfast buffet at Mammoth which was still not great but got us well fed for the day. 

Hiked the overlook to Grand Prismatic (2ish miles) and the upper geyser basin. Timed well to take a shot at seeing Grand Geyser. Eruption was about an hour into the window and was spectacular. Dinner at Terrace grill back at Mammoth again because there was just no other option. 

Day 4: Now being familiar with the most popular stretch of the park, we had an early breakfast and got to many spots ahead of the crowds as we migrated from Mammoth Lodge to Old Faithful Inn. We made four stops for short hikes around Back Basin, Artist Paintpots, Fountain Paintpot and the walk around Grand Prismatic. Artist Paintpots were the consensus favorite and Grand Prismatic was a bit of a letdown - the overlook is far more impressive.

For something completely different (and this will seem crazy to some I'm sure) we planned to go to Island Park, Idaho for a dinner theatre at Yellowstone Playhouse. It was about an 80 minute drive from Old Faithful and totally worth it. They had the best prime rib I've ever had in my life and the show was silly, family friendly and enjoyed by all. We've found that random things like this one help to prevent beauty fatigue from constant hot springs and geysers.

And now lesson 3: Understand what you're getting from Old Faithful Inn. This is a 1 star hotel in a 5 star location. Go in the lobby, it's stunning. Don't stay there. 

Check in was at 4 PM. But 4 PM came and went and our rooms weren't ready. This meant we couldn't get our luggage in from the car until we got back from the show at 9:30. The elevator has been ""under maintenance"" for weeks, so that meant carrying our luggage up to the third floor. 

It turns out they play live music in the lobby until 10 PM every night. The walls are so thin, you can hear EVERYTHING and they might as well have been playing music in the room. Sleeping was out of the question. No AC, probably not an issue normally but when we got in the heat was on in the room and it had to be 80. The pillows are the size of throw pillows. It's almost like they're trying to make it uncomfortable. Our first morning we went for breakfast and must have gone just behind a bus tour because they told us it's a 40 minute wait. Very frustrating in a place we paid to stay at especially considering 2/3 of the tables were empty. Breakfast is identical to Mammoth. They have ice cream in a quick service shop but they were out of 3 of 7 flavors. The last day they ran out of coffee lids. It was phenomenally bad from a hotel perspective but being able to walk 2 minutes to Old Faithful was nice. 

Day 5: Drove the remainder of the lower loop, hiked West Thumb basin (a bit of hot spring fatigue now) and drove up to the start of Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. The canyon is magnificent and I do wish we had spent a little more time there. We decided to cancel our dinner reservation at the Inn because we couldn't stomach the idea of a $200 meal based on our experience to this point. We spent the afternoon chasing geysers. The timing looked good to line up a bunch so we caught Old Faithful from the overlook (about a mile hike uphill and a nice vantage point) and then straight to Grand geyser (by our youngest's request even though we'd seen it once) and it erupted just as we arrived. Seeing from a new angle was an extra bonus. We got to Castle at the start of the window and paid for our luck with Grand as it didn't erupt for 2 hours. If we had a little more luck we would have been able to get to Riverside after but Castle took its time and we stuck with it. Still a great show. Of all, Grand was definitely everyone's favorite.

Dinner was ice cream.

Day 6: Part of the decision early on was driven by the idea of getting to Grand Teton for the last day. Given the drive of just over an hour I'd say it was worthwhile although we could have spent another day there. Stopped in Jackson Lake Lodge and had breakfast at the Pioneer Grill which was excellent. Kids say the best pancakes they ever had. Stopped at a couple pullouts for views of mountains and ultimately Jenny Lake (completing another Junior Ranger book here) and chose to hike the south side of the lake and take the boat back. This was a mistake. The hike was good and we saw a bull moose and Hidden Falls was spectacular. Unfortunately the wait for the boat back was over an hour and it really killed our day. We completed the loop drive but didn't make many stops on the way back that we otherwise would have made. Stopped at the marina for pizza (another GuideAlong suggestion) which was very good. Back to the inn to pack for the flight home.

All in all we drove around 950 miles over 30 hours in the car. Probably could have been more efficient here but it's a huge park and often congested. 

TL;DR:

- GuideAlong app is a must
- Highly recommend Junior Ranger programs for kids
- Bring your own food where you can
- Old Faithful Inn is not kid friendly
- Look beyond Old Faithful and Grand Prismatic, the park is loaded with gems!

We first met in that classic I-4 traffic—congested one second, wide open the next. You were in a black Buick, and I was in a rush. But unlike most drivers who close every inch of space in front of them, you did something rare: you flashed your lights and actually made space so I could pass. Not once, but multiple times.

Before I knew it, we were kind of working together leapfrogging cars, opening gaps for one another, zigzagging through traffic like a team. Then you disappeared. You took off on the right and I couldn’t follow, and for a good half hour I was pushing 100 mph trying to catch up. I thought I lost you.

But then boom there you were again.

I passed you on the right when traffic backed up, and a few minutes later, I slowed down, wondering if you were still back there. Sure enough, you showed up again two cars behind me. We took the same exit onto I-75 heading toward Wesley Chapel. I let you pass, and we exchanged smiles and a salute.

You kept weaving through traffic like before, and I followed from a distance. Near exit 279, my exit, you popped up again. I couldn’t believe you were taking the same exit as me after 60-70 miles on the road! We were side by side. We smiled, nodded one final time… and then went our separate ways. You turned right, I turned left.

Man, I’ll remember that drive for a loong time. I could genuinely tell how nice of a person you are and definitely one of the best drivers out there! 

If by some miracle you see this, thank you. Would’ve been cool to grab a coffee or just say hey properly. Either way, drive safe out there, brother. If our paths don’t cross again (literally!), I hope you have a great life. But from now on I’m on the lookout for a black Buick when I’m driving.

Nobody’s gonna want to hear this, and I really just cannot WAIT for the deluge of “nooo, people are totally mean to fat/ugly individuals, here’s a study!”

Well, what you and that study didn’t account for is that being unattractive- or perceiving yourself as such - comes with an almost inevitable lack of confidence and self-esteem. Lack of confidence and self-esteem go hand in hand with, if not BEING miserable, then certainly coming off miserable. 

People with low confidence avoid eye contact, which comes across as off-putting. They don’t smile a lot, which comes across as unfriendly. They’re less likely to initiate friendly chitchat, they can appear unapproachable, not because of any genuine ill will toward the world, but because of shame in oneself and one’s appearance. 

I’m someone who has struggled with her weight her whole life. It’s been up, it’s been down, it’s like God shoved a bicycle pump up my ass and just inflates or deflates me at total random, I am the queen of yoyo dieting. I suck at maintenance. 

With that said, the thing that doesn’t change, the thing that persists across all weights all my life is my confidence and friendliness. When I walk into a store, I’m smiling, making eye contact, asking how the clerk’s day is going, making jokes. Laughing at other people’s jokes. Commenting on current events. Just basically being a warm person. I’m nice to servers, all manner of customer service people, etc. and you know what happens? I get free shit, constantly. I get items comped, I get free extras at coffee places, I get free drinks at bars. I get flirted with, I get numbers I didn’t ask for. 

When I was a server and whenever I worked in customer service and sales, same. Always at the top of the performance charts, always tipped well, paid well, promoted according to my performance. 

Aside from being bullied in elementary school because little kids are absolute scumbags no matter who you are, I’ve literally never experienced this phenomenon of being fat/unattractive causing any problems. My boyfriends - despite being revealed as cheaters and jerks in the end - have always been hot, like conventionally, out of my league hot. I’ve had guys absolutely melt for me, just on the basis of what I assume was personality alone, since at the time I was not what you’d consider even a 6/10. 

I realize I’m just one person and this is just one anecdote, and I don’t say shit like this to antagonize or enrage anyone or invalidate anyone. 

I say it to the people who think they’re getting a raw deal and being treated bad because they’re not hot. To them I say, it matters waaaay the fuck less than you think. People don’t primarily positively respond to, and treat well, those who are pretty. In fact, pretty people tend to inspire a lot of jealousy and resentment. 

People respond to those who are genuine, warm, funny, engaging, good listeners, and kind. It’s a gut punch and it makes me sad the amount of people out in the world who seem so shocked that some random person would take the time to even remember their name, let alone be sincerely kind to them, look them in the eye, ask them how they’re doing, smile, and make them smile too. 

People just want to be treated well. You certainly don’t have to be pretty to do that. Try it. 

(Seriously, I get so much free shit and positive attention it’s insane, and I’ve never been pretty. Try it.)

1lbjoxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1lbjoxx/how_to_build_an_adventure_from_your_couch/,How to Build an Adventure From Your Couch,"**The Travel Itinerary Planner.**

The world is drowning in travelers who have no idea what they’re doing. They pack their bags with the desperation of a gambler throwing chips at a table he doesn’t understand. They land in foreign countries armed with Google searches and shallow listicles, bumping through generic tours, eating at whatever spot has the longest line, and calling it adventure. This is where you come in. **The itinerary planner.** The fixer. The one who actually knows where to send these wanderlust junkies before they stumble into another overpriced tourist trap wearing a fanny pack and dead eyes.

Building travel itineraries is not a hobby for armchair dreamers or spreadsheet cowboys. It is an art form for those with a dark obsession for details. You are the cartographer of chaos, drawing up routes that pull travelers away from the herds and into something real. You are not just selling plane tickets and hotel rooms. You are stitching together stories, stitching together moments that slap people awake and remind them why they boarded that metal tube in the first place.

Your office is wherever your laptop lands. Coffee shops that reek of burnt espresso. Hotel lobbies filled with corporate zombies. Airport lounges where the gin flows too early in the morning. You are mobile, untethered, a digital mercenary for hire. The platforms are there, waiting. Upwork, Fiverr, and independent consulting gigs that appear like shadows in your inbox. The clients come crawling to you, wide-eyed and helpless. They want something special. They want something they couldn’t find on page one of a search engine. They want your mind.

You start with the raw ingredients. Dates. Budgets. Destinations. Special needs. Allergies. Obsessions. You ask questions that make them uncomfortable. Do you want safe or dangerous? Do you want beaches or back alleys? Do you want to see the world or be seen pretending you saw it? Every answer slices the options thinner until the trip takes shape.

You are pulling strings behind the curtain, tapping your global network. The weird contacts. The fixer in Istanbul who can get you into that secret hammam. The fisherman’s cousin in Hokkaido who serves sashimi straight from the dock. The Parisian chef who runs a supper club behind an unmarked door. The tuk-tuk driver in Bangkok who knows where the real food hides after midnight. You don’t find these people through corporate partnerships or sponsored packages. You collect them like rare insects, trading favors and stories across continents.

Customization is your vibe. The average travel agency pumps out packages stamped from the same rusted mold. You are crafting each journey with surgical precision. You know which boutique hotel has the balcony facing the right sunrise. You know which narrow alley leads to that stall where the grandmother serves noodles that taste like a religious experience. You know which bar in Lisbon pours ginjinha with an extra pour when you mention the owner’s name.

Technology is your accomplice, but it doesn’t own you. Folders filled with flight algorithms, secret fare finders, and backdoor booking engines sit on your screen. Spreadsheets calculate travel times with cold logic. Google Maps becomes your battlefield, measuring walking distances, train schedules, border crossings, and weather patterns. But it’s your instincts that build the journey. The gut tells you when to insert a rest day in Florence, when to nudge a client toward a street food crawl in Ho Chi Minh City, or when to swap Dubrovnik for Kotor to dodge the cruise ship hordes.

There is risk in this game. You own the blame if something goes wrong. A volcano erupts. A visa gets denied. A pandemic flips the table. You roll with it. You reroute. You absorb the fury of clients who don’t understand that the world laughs at human planning. And still you build again. That’s the price of being the architect behind the curtain.

This work is not for the faint-hearted. It’s for those addicted to nuance, those who thrive on solving problems people don’t even know they have yet. You eat guidebooks for breakfast and devour foreign forums for dessert. You haunt Reddit threads, talk to bartenders, harass hotel clerks for insider tips, and strike up conversations with tour guides off-duty. Every encounter, every whispered recommendation, becomes another brick in your castle of knowledge.

The money is there if you’re ruthless. Packages for honeymooners looking for the trip that makes their friends jealous. Luxury clients who want to sip champagne while riding camels under Moroccan stars. Solo travelers craving something dangerous but not stupid. Families begging for child-friendly safaris that won’t leave the kids screaming by day two. Your fee isn’t just for the itinerary. It’s for the certainty. The comfort of knowing someone obsessed over every detail so they wouldn’t have to.

At the end of the day, you send them into the world with a stack of confirmations, local contacts, backup plans, and maps marked with your fingerprints. You watch them post pictures from places they never knew existed, eating meals they never dreamed of, standing in alleyways you led them to. They don’t know how close they came to wasting their time with another all-inclusive disaster. You know. That’s enough.

I see a TMJ specialist and now do physical therapy, supplements, prioritize exercise and healthy diet, etc. to help with symptoms. I did not have good dental health growing up. My back teeth are heavily resorted but my front teeth have remained unscathed in terms of fillings. My dentist mentioned I do have erosion likely from grinding damage + coffee. My gums are healthy per my last full exam. I have a slight open bite but dentist does not feel the need to do anything about it at this time. I REALLY prioritize my dental health now - I floss with Dr. Tung’s after eating 3x daily, brush with electric brush and sensodyne, and use Act anti-cavity 2x a day as well as suck on xylitol mints. My progress has been great in terms of stopping the vicious cycle of cavities and fillings. But the erosion still bothers me. My teeth feel small and flat, although I do have a small mouth. 


I’m wondering if in the future veneers would help with the appearance and acid erosion of my front teeth. I feel comfortable doing the front because I have never had decay on them. But I know once I do them I could never go back. What are the pros and cons, and do I sound like an ok candidate? I would certainly continue to wear a night guard forever.

I was buried alive in cement 
My name is  Tanner Buldock. In October 2004 I was 14 years old and I died in one of the most disturbing cases in Colorado history. I moved to Denver from Ohio with my family. I was a shy kid back home but this time I was looking to make some real friends. Tanner approached a student who was sitting alone at lunch. Carter introduced him to a group of three other boys with undisclosed names.  They invited Tanner to go urban exploring after school at what they claimed was an abandoned construction site in the mountains. When we arrived, we noticed the site wasn't abandoned at all. There were fresh tire tracks, new equipment, and active safety barriers. The boys continued anyway, calling me a coward and saying this was why I  never had friends back home. At the site, we found a rope swing hanging from a tree over a plywood floor. The boys each took turns swinging across successfully. Then they pressured me to try it, despite the thoughts of danger. I agreed. The boys wanting to play games had unhatched and loosened the rope pulley attachment. I launched myself, the rope gave way, and I broke through the plywood floor into a cellar. The cellar was filled with wet concrete and sharp rebar. landing directly on the metal bars, which punctured my side and chest. The concrete immediately began trapping my legs and covering my body. I remained conscious as the concrete pulled me down covering my body. The rebar cutting deeper slowly. I was trapped bleeding out but would likely suffocate first. The missing person case was quietly closed as an accident 18 years later when the building was demolished again revealing the remains of Tanner Buldock . The suspects were never charged and never saw court. The construction site was bought out and covered to make room for a coffee chain.

I don’t usually believe in ghost stories or the paranormal, but what happened to me one night on a road trip through a tiny Ohio town has permanently changed how my perspective about seeing the world, I’m still not sure if what I encountered was some dark human evil, something supernatural, or an unholy blend of both, but I know it was terrifying and real.

It started when I was driving late at night, somewhere in southern Ohio, just passing through on my way back home, GPS cut out and found myself on this narrow, winding backroad surrounded by dense, ancient woods that seemed to swallow the moonlight, after pulling off the highway because the gas light had been on for miles, hoping to find a station or maybe a diner.

What I found instead was a forgotten town, with no street signs, no neon lights, and no cell service, just a handful of old, boarded-up buildings, some with peeling paint, others completely collapsed, the only thing standing somewhat intact was a decrepit gas station that looked like it hadn’t served fuel in decades.

The air was unnervingly cold, and a thick fog had rolled in, muffling the sounds of the world, I didn’t see a single person and started to find myself in the middle of nowhere without anybody to help me when panic almost set in as My mind remembered hearing stories of people getting lost out in the forests never to be seen again no remains or anything left of them.

I cautiously left my car to look for help or a phone and almost immediately regretted it, as soon as stepping off the cracked pavement, first I assumed what were whispers from the trees turned into, soft, indecipherable voices saying something in a strange language that was too familiar but couldn't understand the severity of the situation, coming from the trees, it wasn’t the wind, but this was a chorus of voices, too low and close to being natural, seeming to circle around me.

I tried calling out, but my voice was swallowed by the fog, then, I saw movement, shadows slipping between the trees, too fast and flickering like heat haze, but darker, more solid as it walked back toward the gas station, my heart pounding, and suddenly, a figure emerged from the fog, a man, gaunt, with sunken eyes that reflected a strange, unnatural light, his clothes were old-fashioned, torn, and stained, and he smiled, too wide, too slow revealing yellow teeth and some of them were missing then I tried to ask him for directions but got no response from him.

I was about to run back to my car when a rusted old pickup truck pulled up noisily, an elderly woman stepped out, eyes sharp but weary, and she motioned me toward a small diner still faintly lit on the far end of the street I was panicking at this point but she was very kind and told me to get out of here while there was still a chance because luck was about to run out at any time.

Inside, the atmosphere was heavy with stale coffee and something metallic, like blood, the woman introduced herself as the town’s last caretaker and began telling me about “The Cutter's Hollow”, a place where people disappeared and were never found again this really made me want to get the hell out of there and never go back to that remote area of Ohio and it was said here that the serial killer dumped his bodies of the victims mostly young women who were traveling alone on a remote road.

She said the town had been cursed decades ago, after a series of brutal murders by that very serial killer who was never caught, but it wasn’t just a human evil, something else fed on the town’s pain, something older as people started disappearing again, she whispered, victims, taken into the woods by unseen forces, some townsfolk claimed they saw creatures with twisted limbs and glowing red eyes lurking among the trees, neither fully human nor animal but something malevolent and ancient lurking in the shadows with its deer antlers gleaming with the blood it spilled from its victims.

I decided to wait for dawn in the diner, but something compelled me to check the gas station one last time, outside, the fog was thicker, and the whispers were louder, almost pleading, suddenly, from the darkness, those creatures emerged, lanky, grotesque, with elongated limbs and mouths too wide for their faces, they moved with unnatural speed, and their eyes burned with a demonic red flame.

I froze as one of them stepped forward and reached toward me with a hand that seemed both skeletal and wet like it was rotting yet alive, the smell hit me then, rot, decay, and something far worse, I ran to my car and drove off without looking back. In the rearview mirror, and swear I saw the gaunt man standing on the road, watching me leave with that terrible smile as he waved menacingly and knew that he was the serial killer or at least assumed he was.

I told a few people about it, but they dismissed it as exhaustion or imagination, yet, I know what I saw. Sometimes, when I’m alone, and still hear those whispers in the wind or catch a glimpse of glowing red eyes in the dark, that small town in Ohio erased from maps and memory is not just abandoned, it was a place where something terrible dwells, a wound in a reality where human darkness and something far older bleeds together.

If you ever drive through rural Ohio and see a foggy road that disappears into ancient woods, don’t stop, don’t listen to the whispers, and whatever you do just keep driving.",3,1749936470.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I’ve been living in Saint John for a little over a year and a half now. I moved here from Latin America, and while it’s been a great experience so far, making friends has been a bit of a challenge.

I’m in my 30s, into rock, post-hardcore, video games, soccer, and always open to discover new interests too. I would really like to connect with people who share similar hobbies — or honestly, just anyone open to chat, grab a coffee, go for a walk, catch a concert or game, or simply share some local insights.

At the same time, I’m also very interested in learning more about Canadian culture and day-to-day life here. Even though my English is at a intermediate-advanced level, I’m always looking to improve and sound more natural, so any tips or advice are more than welcome!

So yeah — if anyone’s open to hang out, share experiences, or has any advice on how to better integrate, feel free to drop me a message. Always happy to meet new people here in SJ!

Who are you...
Youve made your experience, you know who you are, you know what you like and what you need. You crave good communication and its your first step in trying to solve something. You aint a Party person because it doesnt appeal to you, the loud noice, your friends with who youd like to talk to but your voice aint able to scream over the music. The unwanted touches while moving to the beat.

You are able to enjoy the little things more then the biggest suprises. The ready cup of coffee, the Look at you while he things you wouldnt notice. The Grass on your toes. Being able to sit in silence engaged in your own Hobby but still trying to move even an inch closer to each other, finding each other across the room without needing a Word to know that you are enough.

I want us both to be honest, blunt maybe, i want to know you, see you, for that i also want you to know me and see me. I want US to carry each other through sunshine and heavy storms.

Who am I ?
Someone unperfect but maybe the puzzle piece that fits.

Oh sweet Lord of fluorescent lights,
Why hast Thou abandoned me
To this forsaken realm of polar pops, totnados, lottery tickets,
And 2 a.m. drunkards requesting zig zags and magnums?

What sin did I commit in a past life
To now stand beneath the Frosterl Machine,
That eternal fountain of stickiness,
Which hath overflowed again—oh cursed Cherry Coke!


I ring up Hot Cheetos and energy drinks
For teens who speak in TikToks and eye rolls,
Whilst a man named Dave ""the love slave"" demands
That I accept his expired coupon “because it’s the principle.”

The coffee is tar, the hot dogs spin like forgotten dreams,
And someone always asks if the restroom key is “really necessary.”
Yea, it is. For without it, thou would unleash chaos
Upon porcelain and tile not built for mortal horrors.

O vending gods, why doth the ice machine screameth so?
Why doth customers enter barefoot?
Why doth the man in the trench coat whisper,
“I’ve returned… for the Funyuns”?


My kingdom is 700 square feet of madness:
Where the chips are never stocked right,
The receipt paper runs out only during rush hour,
And the air freshener smells like citrus and despair.

“Clean aisle 3,” they say,
Where some cryptid hath exploded a smoothie,
Leaving behind a Jackson Pollock of mango and shame.


I am the bard of the beep scanner,
The prophet of “price check!”
The guardian of the cigarette wall,
The reluctant priest of fuel pump pre-authorizations.

My only solace?
A day-old frozen donut and the company of Carl,
Who’s worked nights since 1997
And speaks only in cryptic gas station riddles.


So here I stand,
broken yet strong,
Sticky yet proud,
Underpaid yet oddly loyal.

For I am a Circle KEmployee,
Sworn to the chaos,
Forever scanning…
Forever stocking…
Forever haunted by the microwave's haunting BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEP. The voices remind me that ""If I got time to lean, I got time to clean.""

Amen. Now who put Slim Jims in the freezer again?!

My wife (46) and I (48) have been in our current home 9 years.  We very fortunately are down to $30k left on our mortgage and recast it to a low monthly payment after the sale of a rental property.

Our boys are 12 and 16.  It's been a great home to raise a family, and we have no need to move right now.  We want our boys to finish school here.

But, there are ""first world problem"" with the home.  First, the development hasn't appreciated as much as much as others nearby.  If we had spent a little more 9 years ago, we'd be in a home with much more value (maybe $150k-$200k more).  Second, we're ""landlocked."" There's no bike trails or sidewalks from this development to the rest of the area.  It's disappointing because much of the region is connected with a regional bike loop, but it's never coming here.  

In our mind, we've said ""we aren't moving until our boys are grown and settled."". And maybe that's the right thing.  The thought of buying up into a new mortgage (likely $200k) sounds like a bad idea.  But man it would be nice a few years from now to hop on my bike and ride to get coffee or bring our paddle boards to a nearby lake.  

And maybe the into a home that should appreciate more?

I got three scrambled eggs and smothered covered hash browns alone and ate is covered in Tabasco, saved my raisin bread toast for dessert and made it extra sweet with mixed berry jelly, and washed it all down with bitter, watery black coffee.)

I met this devil on Facebook in 2016 during my pick-me era. I felt so weird having a man as my best friend, but we lost contact for several years because I had a jealous boyfriend.

As it turns out, she's transgender, so I guess I wasn't that big of a pick-me after all! I broke up with that ex, and was missing all the friends he separated me from, especially her. My new boyfriend is 40 and still uses Facebook, so I ended up making a new one, and eventually tried to look her up, couldn't find her, remembered her sister's name, and found her on her picture all done up in goth make-up under her sister's friend list under the name of her favorite video game character.

She lived in a small town just outside of Columbus, and I lived in a small town just outside of Detroit. It was only 3 hours to meet, but we were both in our early twenties, broke, and never coordinated enough to plan some time to meet.

Some number of months ago I met a nice guy on r/r4r, actually. He lived in Columbus and he came and got me one night when I was doing really bad. I was less afraid to drive down here myself watching him do it. I'm down here a lot with him. I think that's why I was thinking about her so much, too.

The last time we talked, I was still with my ex. He had made me block her. She messaged me on a new account to tell me she had multiple sclerosis, a disease she knew has haunted me , as my mother and my first serious boyfriend both had it, and that she was going to kill herself before she became a burden on society. I thought of how I took care of my first boyfriend from him walking with a cain to him in a wheelchair and eventually a diaper until I couldn't take it anymore. I accepted the message request and tried to talk her out of it. I'd like to say a trigger warning with this next part, so if domestic violence bothers you, skip to the next paragraph now, but one of two times my controlling ex ever beat my ass was on this day when he found me messaging her. I remember him over and over again telling me she is, ""A snake.""

A little back story, too, from the two years prior to me getting with my ex, I was helping her get diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder after she started telling me how she really feels about life. So she literally is a diagnosed sociopath. I never held it against her our whole friendship, 'cause I know she can't help it, but I never truly trusted her. 

A few months ago I send her some money on Cashapp for gas to come out to my boyfriend's show. My boyfriend is involved with an indie wrestling promotion and I was gunna get her in for free (not really free, I was gunna pay my boyfriend back later for the ticket if she did show up,) and she stood me up last minute, but did give me my ten dollars back. I didn't hold it against her, though. I was busy that night helping out and didn't ask questions.

We actually barely talk now. Our conversations were a little insane back then. I was high all the time. Now I barely message her up until this meeting. I tell her we'll get late night breakfast. I was thinking on my controlling ex. We were together for six years, and the last two of them he developed a drug problem. At the beginning of the relationship, he hated my devil-may-care lifestyle, always acting on impulse and doing random things, then after his drug addiction, he told me he missed things I used to do. Things like forget to eat all day and then go out to breakfast at midnight somewhere kitsch and campy and grungy like a Waffle House. So I asked her to breakfast Friday night at 11:30.

She told me okay and that she was gunna try not to eat.  I remembered how, before we reconnected, she used to make fun of my weight. I was really not wanting to look fat around her, and was stressing about looking thin. She would often criticize me for my impulsiveness, snacking often, and posting all the time. I did a lot to change that over the years. 

She seemed more impulsive lately, and admitted to having a shiny new meth problem. I was a little wary, but tried not to judge. She used to not smoke weed, and I smoked a ton. She ended up smoking weed at some point during the closest parts of our friendship, and I'm afraid I might have rubbed off on her. She also started tripping LSD at a certain point towards the end, and I ended up doing the same. We stopped talking around then. I stopped doing drugs completely after a bad acid trip, I can't do it anymore without having a flash back. I also got religious, but I stick to Christianity, as cringe as that may sound. Since we started talking again, she's been kinda spiritual, in a made up sort of way. And I go to church and look to the bible for guidance. She seems to just make stuff up. It scares me, but it also makes her look dangerous in my eyes. I think I remember being stoner-spiritual with her when we use to talk all the time.

She told me at one point, she asked for money for healthy food, and explained that she needs to eat healthy for her MS. I told her there was some healthy stuff on the menu at Waffle House. She claimed that she's just been eating whatever, and she controlled her MS symptoms by doing meth. Right then is when I started wondering if she was telling the truth on that one.

At one point when I was going to church, the pastor was saying, ""When God is stopping you from being with a person, listen. Don't keep entertaining the idea. That person is a snake. It's not just breakfast."" Yes, the pastor had used the phrase, ""It's not just breakfast,"" and talked about a person being a snake. I don't remember the whole context of the sermon, but I remember those lines. I was nervous about the whole thing. 

My boyfriend had been concerned about me not having friends. That's part of the reason I made plans to meet her again. I had been wary before, too, because one time before the show I invited her to, I was at the gym. I get a text from her. It was 3:33 PM, I open the text, and I accidentally trip the stop sensor on the treadmill. I had just burned 333 calories, and had been walking for 33 minutes and 33 seconds. She's asking for money when I read the text. I had read a while ago that as a Christian, angel numbers are an omen. I had only read that on a website that claimed to be Christian, that angel numbers are the Devil trying to trick you, and never found it anywhere in more official studies, but it just seemed too weird for me.

I still wanted to go through with meeting her this time, I'm too insecure about not having friends. I broke my foot earlier this summer, and have been showering in the handy cap stall in the gym to avoid falling at home, and I planned to do that the day of our meeting. However, that morning I woke up and I prayed to God to make all my decisions for me. It was advice I got from a member of the prayer team at my church, to give everything up to God, and let Him control you. Sounds insane, I know, but it helps with my anxiety. I woke up at 9 am, like I usually do, anxious, and I said this prayer. I promptly went back to sleep for 4 hours. When I woke up, I felt weird. I needed to go to the gym, but I just lacked the gumption, I was tired and achey from going about and carrying on with a broken foot for days. I ended up not going, and missing my shower window.

I still wanted to go. As I watched Friday night Smackdown with my boyfriend, I gave myself a whores bath with baby wipes and baby powder, put on baby lotion (it's cheaper, plus works and smells great, okay,) brushed my long bottle blonde hair with a boars hair brush to get the grease out, and washed my face in the sink with Cetaphil cleanser and slugged with some Aquaphor. I dressed myself in a hundred dollar baby pink Popflex dress, a white cardigan that had pastel 3D flowers knit into it I impulse bought from Meijer's while grocery shopping, and one white Doc Marten with a nice white compression sock folded over the top to give it a softer look. My other foot had on what my brother jokingly referred to as ""Das boot,"" in a german accent the summer when he was 21 and I was 17 and we were drinking together and watching TV a lot. Das boot was luckily a pretty light grey color, and didn't distract from the color scheme of the outfit. I asked my boyfriend what earrings I should wear, the silver heart shaped hoops, or the gold Channel studs, he said silver hoops. I grabbed my purse, which was very nice and thrifted from a small, not-Goodwill thrift store, and was white leather with a floral print. I looked put together. As I went out the door, I texted my old friend, ""Eta 30 minutes, leaving now."" Halfway there, I got more nervous. I sprayed a powdery rose perfume I keep in my purse on my pulse points. When I park, I hope she didn't see me pull in, and I quickly apply the make-up I packed. A swipe of brown eyeliner, a twirl of brown mascara, dabbed on red lipstick, and a glop of red lipgloss smeared precisely in place. As perfect as I could be, I waddled into the Waffle House on one and a half feet. 

I text her that I'm here. She says she can't see me, and then a second later that she needs me to pick her up. It's 11:30 and I haven't eaten. I text my actual best friend of fourteen years, Candice, that my old friend did, in fact, flake. I had been explaining all of this to her, and Candy had been weary of the whole thing, because a lot of the details of my friend and our relationship were huge red flags, I guess. She was really hung up on the whole, ""Diagnosed sociopath and addicted to meth,"" thing. 

The fact that she pretended like she was here to mess with me before saying she needed to be picked up kind of set me off. Me at 20, in the height of my friendship with her, would have been desperate to lose myself in someone else for a night. The most recent sermon I had attended reminded me that you are never really alone with God, and if God wants you separated from people for standing up for what is right, like Paul did with the gentiles in Galatians, than that's what you have to do. And I think standing up for myself was right. I was not comfortable meeting her in a non-public setting. She texts me her address and I put my phone on airplane mode, pull out my journal. 

The waitress, when I hobbled in, asked me what I wanted after telling me to sit anywhere. I took a booth that she wouldn't have to walk far to and told her just a water while I wait for my friend. Now I turn to her and said my friend wasn't coming. I order 3 scrambled eggs and a smothered covered hash brown with a black coffee. Apparently, toast comes with the eggs, and I chose raisin bread, which I saved for the end to eat as a dessert. The eggs and hash browns were covered in Tabasco, and I used mixed berry jelly on my toast to make it extra sweet, while I drank bitter coffee with it at the end.

I paid eleven dollars for the meal and tipped four. As I pulled out, I turned on the radio and didn't use the GPS because this was a route I knew by heart, being on the way I took out of Columbus to go back to Detroit when I needed to. Led Zeppelin was playing on a station not on my presets, and I was angry and listened. I thought about who I was when I was 20. I loved classic rock and was my older brother's best friend. My Doc Marten would have been black and cheap, as would my dress and every thing else. My hair was cut like Ramona Flowers and dyed half black and orange, or purple, or some other unnatural color I formulated myself like a bathroom wizard. I was high all the time and living with my parents. And I was not that girl anymore. I can't pick up some girl I barely know in the middle of the night even though I'm tired and drive around doing stupid random bullshit because I'm desperate to get out of the house. Midnight breakfast was one thing, but I couldn't go on a whole goose chase with her. I'm too grown for that. 

I turn the radio station and listen to Chappell Roan, and Sabrina Carpenter, and Madonna the rest of the way home. I wasted a really nice outfit on a boring night. The voice of the creator of some obscure Adult Swim show rang in my head, ""Do you know how much of a let down you are?"" It was anticlimactic. But, I remember the story my old friend had told me years ago about a girl who she had dated, that she was obsessed with her looks, ""but her looks had faded,"" and that they took all her Adderall prescription together and crashed her car. She posted, ""Don't Dream It's Over,"" by Crowded Room, and said it was playing when they crashed. But it is over, I don't need an indie movie to happen to me in real life just because I'm bored anymore. My friend said last time she talked to her ex, her ex blamed my friend for brain washing her and turning her into a little home-maker. I thought on that for a moment, too. 

One last thing I thought on, the mother of my first ex, the one who actually had MS, she was a hoot and seemed like she never grew out of being 20 years old, and claimed to be a psychic witch. She complained to me about how her mother thought, when she was in college, that it was okay for her to spend the night with her boyfriend, but just ridiculous to stay up all night in a diner with a girlfriend drinking coffee. 

I went and crawled into bed next to my man naked after just stripping, sleeping in my makeup. I can act like I'm 20 years old a little, I guess, but I don't need anyone to pick me now. I am a child of God, and He picked me. (I could say I chose myself, but I don't know how much that really fits, and it's cliche by now.)

Even so, now that I am ruminating over last night, I wonder if she was a Cretan and I was a good Samaritan, or if I am just insane and boring. And afraid. ",4,1749935373.0,badfoodporn,9,0.67,False

Befuddled to be the last family left in the whole village. They turned their eyes to Rio, their three year old wiley child & the only one who didn’t realize what had happened. The ultimate test to them, as parents, was to distract him from the undeniable truth that had destroyed the townsfolk. He also couldn’t come to the realization of what they really were, or what all of the beings were before they were gone. Under the new circumstances, this was an unshakable truth that even they, themselves - could barely accept. 

  Zendaya, the dumbfounded mother was in a blank stare of stupor.. so Taz the father had to take the reins and wake her up from this frozen state. He reached out his hand and gave her a shake on her shoulder and said quietly “ Babe, we have to keep it together for Rio’s sake.” She said nothing but tears starting welling up in her eyes. By this acknowledgement, he knew this was going to be all up to him as she couldn’t keep it all together quite yet. He ran to the kitchen to make her coffee and start some eggs for Rio’s breakfast. In the brink of it - hearing the drip after drip go into the coffee-stained coffee pot, he caught himself also in a daze.. at a loss in the midst of the exact opposite of simplicity. He couldn’t shake the feeling & was about to experience being the last of a civilization and was struggling to devise a plan to keep them alive.

I really like talking to people, like, it’s my favorite thing ever to connect with someone and to laugh and have fun. But I have a problem, I tend to be too hyper, and I’m scared that makes people uncomfortable. Like I get really smiley, talkative and asking them too many questions. I feel like that can be overwhelming for someone… and I get that. I remember one time I was getting coffee with my boyfriend, the barista asked me “How long have you been in braces for?”, I responded with “ohhhhhh maybe like 2 years already I’m so excited to get them off but I’m scared of the retainer because what if it gets gross I heard they’re hard to clean!” The barista seemed genuinely interested in talking to me and I know it seem like they’re just trying to make a customer comfortable but I wanted to get to know them. They were receptive too and willing to speak with me. My boyfriend cut our conversation short by saying we had to go, my boyfriend said I was holding that barista from their job up by “talking too much” and said “it makes people uncomfortable and annoyed when you speak like that” and I couldn’t help but to understand that he was right. Really, that whole experience prompted me to write this post. Even my own boyfriend finds me annoying sometimes, one time we were playing a video game together and I was so excited, he said he found something cool in the video game and I just wanted to see so badly and he got irritated and said “oh my god you’re just in my ear and face, I feel so overstimulated. Just calm down.” I don’t want to make another person feel annoyed ever. Every time I meet someone new and it could blossom into a friendship, I’m scared that I just get connected to easily like if I ask for their number or social media to further connect with them I’m being weird and needy. I get scared to reach out to them and ask them to hangout because they’ll think I’m being needy or annoying. I don’t even know what to say or ask them where to hangout and I’m scared of bothering people. Lately, I’ve just been closing my mouth. I feel like people might think asking for someone’s number just to hangout might be weird because no one’s ever asked for my number just to hangout before.

I’m looking for guidance on how to recover my seller fees for a recent transaction that did not result in a completed sale.

A buyer purchased a high-end coffee maker from me for $1,450. While I was en route to UPS to drop off the package—well within my handling time—the buyer filed a payment dispute. Given that the dispute was opened almost immediately and the buyer's account appeared to be newly created, I chose not to proceed with shipping. I also contacted eBay, and they explicitly advised me **not to ship the item**.

Unfortunately, I was unable to cancel the order on my end due to the pending dispute. Ultimately, the dispute was resolved in the buyer’s favor, and the transaction was voided. However, I was charged the full selling fees and promotional fees, and eBay has since informed me that they will not be issuing a refund for those amounts.

Since the item was never shipped and the transaction was not completed due to a payment issue on the buyer's end, I don’t believe it’s reasonable to be charged the full seller fees. I’m hoping someone here may have encountered a similar situation or has advice on how to escalate this matter to possibly recover the fees.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.",4,1749935023.0,eBaySellerAdvice,5,1.0,False

(sofa is pic 3),"Looking to upgrade our sofa, partner would prefer leather in a similar style to the sofa in picture one which we have had for 7 years and is no longer comfy. RH Cloud sofa seemed like a good quality option without going fully custom.

Photos 2 and 3 are the options my partner likes for sofa and coffee table that actually fits the space. 

Photo 3: I'm questioning going with a darker leather (pictured is RH Cloud Slope sofa in Italian Berkshire Walnut) as I do not want to repaint. I know dark color drenching is not for everyone but I LOVE IT! It feels like a cozy hotel lobby. The lighter leather options really clashed with the terracotta floor and I don't love the idea of a white/stone leather..too risky!

Picture 2: I like the contrast of a lighter marble if we do go darker plus it will work well with our dining room table which is marble with similar base. 

What do you think? We can order the same cloud sofa in a natural boucle or linen which would be very close to what we already have today. Any reservations on RH cloud sofa in general?

UH OH! Someone has been using stinky language and [u/Ok\_Diet3345](/user/Ok_Diet3345/) decided to check [u/gx\_lasagna](/user/gx_lasagna/)'s bad word usage.

I have gone back 734 comments and reviewed their potty language usage.

1lbj0d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/valzubiriagenda/comments/1lbj0d2/what_is_valzubiriagenda_and_some_ideas_and/,What is #VALZUBIRIAGENDA and some ideas and insights,"# The 3 basic parameters of hashtag #Valzubiriagenda:

1. **We artists and everyone else can write and self-publish art- and artist-related books: memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs.** Books are forever. Pamphlets and brochures are not books.
2. **We announce a schedule of increasing prices of our art pieces,** which includes quantities (scarcity numbers) per price point and overall (the total quantity of art pieces we might ever make). This helps art traders, art investors and art collectors speculate or even stop speculating and instead join a community of investors working together to hopefully skyrocket to the higher announced prices in a shorter span of time.
3. **We can use the NFT world, because NFTs provide the tracking (who owns what) and trading.**

We can also not be involved with NFTs. Stores and individuals can help sell art using online presence and our catalogs in the stores. If this trends, or once this trends, even expensive art can be sold by neighboring businesses, without exclusivity. Commission systems do not have to be standardized. Art investors can produce their own catalogs to leave at the cafés. Even the cafés can produce their own catalogs.

**Valzubiriagenda NFTs**

**NFTs only came about a few years ago.** But I had been working on this since the 1990s. I wrote a book, **Valzubiriagenda**, along with fellow artist **Silverio Perez,** and released it in 2018 (Amazon and elsewhere), tackling everything related to #1 & #2. We'll come up with #3 in a later book/ memoir/ marketing book.

Any artist, including tangible artists can release 10,000 NFTs if the artist chooses to do so. For tangible artists, the NFT first becomes an Art Commission Contract for sight unseen, yet-to-be made art. Once the art is made, the NFT becomes proof of ownership that the actual, tangible art is theirs.

**Warehousing our tangible art**

Another related idea is that the tangible art may be warehoused by the artist so that the NFT traders continue to trade. This means that even 10-ton 10-foot tall sculptures can be owned and traded by anyone without worrying about shipping, reshipping, scratches, smudges, parts breaking off, etc. The newness of the pieces remain because they are stored by the artist, source, gallery, etc. The art piece gets shipped to the art collector, the ultimate owner.

An artist who makes ceramic coffee mugs - smaller art pieces, can release 10,000 NFTs with a schedule of increasing prices so that NFT traders can trade immediately. The 10,000 coffee mugs can get damaged, so as they are made, they continue to be stored by the artist, until the time when art collectors decide to have the art pieces shipped to them.

**Why only now?**

I decided to write as many book-length memoirs as I can before I came out to promote this.

I'm an artist and an author. Both need time to ""master."" I would not even fully use ""master"" on myself, because there's always something new, even to my own art, my own writing and publishing.

>*I am now claiming that I'm the visual artist who has produced the most artist memoirs in the world.* I have 5 on Amazon. I count **Valzubiriagenda** as both a marketing book and a memoir-of-sorts, because it has a lot of my own life lessons on writing and publishing. I would not care to contest my claim of having the most memoirs. I will release 5 more over the next 3 years.

**BARTER! Get help to write, photograph art and publish your books!**

Anyone can hire 11 ghostwriters for 11 memoirs. If you can make art, but you cannot write, then barter your forever art with those who can help you produce forever books.

I don't feel the pressure of writing and publishing because I feel my focus should be on art students and art experts who would study my art and my books 100 years from now. Don't expect relatives and friends to read your books.

**I call myself the Dollman**

For my NFTs, I am proposing to make dioramas - my original, costumed, bejeweled porcelain dolls in backdrops that will also have precious metals and gemstones. This way I can incorporate precious metals and gemstones in my work, to make sure that people perceive my art as expensive, just in case I myself don't become ""famous"" - there's no need to get world famous. We are artists and all we need to do is to satisfy the art niche.

**Use your laptop now!**

I will encourage you to start writing your book-length memoir. Write, Edit and then Self-publish it. Get help. Why wait a hundred years for someone to write about you when all you need is a laptop and a nearby coffee shop.

Don't start counting chickens before the eggs hatch. I have encountered a lot of would-be writers who immediately see themselves as bestselling. world famous assets to society. Two even wanted me to sign NDAs (Nondisclosure agreements), because they did not want me to steal their book ideas.

Here's a suggestion. I would not personally do it. From one manuscript can come 2 books: The Original Draft (unedited, with misspellings, considered to be an art piece, scanned pages(?) of your handwritten original effort), and The Final Edition (edited).

**PROVENANCE!**

Another way to enhance our investability, tradability and collectability is **PROVENANCE** ***- how art ownership proceeds through time.*** The way this can be done is also through publishing books. Everyone can write their memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs, including traders, investors and art collectors. In effect, we artists can continue to be included or mentioned in even more books, without any additional effort by us.

You as an investor, reseller, trader, art collector should be able to publish a catalog with 250 works by 250 different artists, but they need to agree to this right from the start - it's your money, you should require them to follow your version of the hashtag ***#valzubiriagenda*** *parameters,* which preferably should include permission for you to publish their art. Why would you track down 250 artists later?

**No exclusive contracts**

If you're a café, you can call for artists, and come up with a book with for example, 30 artists, with a chapter devoted to each artist's profile and images of the artist's art.

You can distribute your catalogs to businesses and individuals near and far and online.

The book **Valzubiriagenda** even cites that funeral homes and janitors closets can sell art, with or without exclusivity. Airline catalogs can include million dollar art pieces. Car manufacturers, showrooms and even car repair shops can sell art as well. Everyone should be able to do this, anywhere in the world, especially not just because of the pandemic, but right now, we are in really bad economies.

**What's with the name #Valzubiriagenda**

I was into conspiracy theories in 2018, and this term, *""The Mandela Effect,""* was popular. I had read many times that an artist coined the term, but I had to research online, for her name, many times, before remembering it. I'm not good at remembering names. It took me a year and a half to finally tell you that **Fiona Broome** coined ""The Mandela Effect.""

I also thought I might have to research trademarks and copyrights just to come up with a generic name. So I decided on **""Valzubiriagenda.""** I was not really sure at first, but I decided to use it as the title for my book (with co-author/artist **Silverio Perez**) so that there would be no turning back and I can move on.

**Am I a FUTURIST?**

Someone I recently met this May 2022 just called me a futurist.

In the 1990s, I proposed to a pension fund that they can raise billions of dollars, especially for emergencies, or as needed, or out of desperation, if the pension fund purchases a quantity of art from an artist who not only has a current, reasonable price, but an announced future price that the artist wants to reach.

That future price would obviously be higher than the current price. The art commission contract for multiple art pieces can be taken to the fund's financial lender for a loan. The higher future price can be used for financing purposes.

The pension fund's treasurer, a publicly elected official, said this idea might work, but we had to keep this a secret and discuss this some more, because other pension funds might copy and do this prematurely. This idea had to come from the two of us. The treasurer needed his votes and I needed credentials.

Added into the pot was my idea that I, as the artist, will also write one book-length artist memoir. This was and still is a strong factor, because the leadership and marketing books I had read then mentioned a strong tip. If you want to advance in your field, write a full-length book that is related to the field.

Unfortunately, the elected official, the treasurer of the pension fund, who was also a friend, passed away - he was old and had ailments. At that point in time, I cannot just approach another pension fund treasurer to share this idea with.

I realized I had to write a few memoirs. I needed to set an example for other artists, so I needed to write more than one memoir. Then I felt I should also make ready another book - the how-to of what I'm up to. I wrote **Valzubiriagenda**, which was a memoir of sorts. I knew how long it would take me to write a book, so I had to make sure I can also consider this book a memoir.

In 2008, I imagined that someone like Bernie Madoff, or a fund like Lehman Brothers, would be desperate enough to use this to save themselves and their companies. I was not ready. I had only written 1 manuscript for a memoir.

In 2012, I released **Dollman the Musical, A Memoir of an Artist as a Dollmaker**. Once again, I was not ready because writing it depressed me a little, and I knew I had to write more.

In 2014, I released 3 memoirs, and re-released **Dollman the Musical.** Besides releasing regular books, I released special editions of the 4 books, which had a **""Special Secret Insert for Bankers,""** which explains my ideas of an announced schedule of exponentially increasing prices, to satisfy investors, and the publication of artist memoirs, to satisfy art collectors.

In 2014, I also issued out a press release. Google ***""Can Billion Dollar Artist Save Investors and World Economy Valentino Zubiri PRWeb August 19 2014""*** and you will see the press release.

What I did was stake a claim on my ideas. I did not promote my books and the press release. I just wanted them to stay online, like a sleeping giant or a dormant volcano. I even designed 3 of the book covers to look like indie books from the 1980s. I was planting the seeds, thinking they will eventually grow and bear fruit in the future.

In 2015, I was interviewed by **Richard Syrett,** about one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.** This book is my memoir with paranormal stories. I could have pursued promoting my paranormal stories, but I wanted to be known first as a visual artist and memoirist, so I allowed myself one interview related to **Hocus Pocus Lately. Richard Syrett** has(had?) his own syndicated radio show, **The Conspiracy Show with Richard Syrett,** about the paranormal. He also guest hosts on **Coast to Coast AM**, another internationally syndicated show about the paranormal.

In 2018, I released **Valzubiriagenda** (co-authored by artist **Silverio Perez,** a fellow artist). Finally, this book is ""the how-to of what I'm to.""

I'm going to end this with some strangeness. In 1986, a lady at a religious gathering went into a trance and left a good number of messages. Supposedly, anyone who got into a trance would have messages, but once the trance was over, the person would not remember what was said.

I was not part of the group, but the lady turned her head to face me. She ""foretold"" that whatever I would decide to do in the future, it will take time, but it will be the right thing. This is one of my stories in one of my memoirs, **Hocus Pocus Lately.**

**The Tulipmania of 1634-37**

I discovered that there was this incident of rare tulips becoming collectible during the Dutch Golden Age. There were tulips so rare and so well-desired that their prices equaled to that of a house. You can read more about this online (Wikipedia) or watch a few YouTube videos about it.

Here is the most useful idea that I gleaned from the Tulipmania. The tulip bulbs remained safe inside nurseries. The traders were carrying the deeds of ownership to the tulip bulbs.

**Then NFTs came to the forefront**

I started learning PHP, an HTML scripting language, and MySQL, the database that PHP can connect to in the background, in 1999, when there were only 3 books about PHP and MySQL at the bookstores.

By 2014, I was trying to figure out how to make the ""ledger,"" or database that can be used to update ownership and who can be contacted. If we are trading art, then the art ownership should be updated.

Then NFTs came about. This can be used as our ledger. Everyone can immediately trade NFTs of future, yet-to-be made art pieces, especially because it takes time to make tangible art.

NFTs actually went a step ahead, by allowing digital art to be traded.

The only setback with NFTs, in my opinion, is that it still lacks a commission system for resellers and representatives.

For example, if a café wants to represent me, then they can promote me at their café and on their online pages. If I make one piece of art that will be exclusively represented by a gallery, then that commission will be different and more specific. As ownership is transferred, the subsequent owners should be able to reset the commission. We should also have the option of giving commissions to hundreds of representatives at one time with different percentages if need be.

**The recent crypto crash**

Lately, we have observed that NFTs and cryptocurrencies have been behaving like the stock market and other markets. They have been fluctuating.

I believe that it is time for a trend which discourages fluctuation of prices.

I have also seen YouTube videos where social influencers are encouraging us to be on the lookout for exponentially profitable ventures, because we have all seen this happen with the exponential increase of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Let's see if #Valzubiriagenda trends**

We can announce present and future art prices. The galleries won't do this (yet?) because they follow a more traditional approach to the business of art.

*We have a choice of using* ***incrementally*** *or* ***exponentially*** *increasing prices.* We still reserve the right to change things in the future, so everyone should know to follow the latest update.

If this trends, if you as an artist simply announces that you will write an artist memoir, or that you will include the future works in future art books, you might have more art traders, investors and collectors approaching you.

**Get your pen, paper and calculator**

Imagine yourself as an artist, where you are right now. Let's just say you still do not have a book about yourself and your art yet. Imagine now that you have a memoir out there. Don't you think it makes sense to charge more than what you are charging now? Writing and publishing books is just the beginning. I'm just standardizing this approach. The books also say to do other related projects. In my case, getting **Dollman the Musical** onstage is one idea. You will have other related projects, but the publication of memoirs, biographies, art books and art catalogs will help all of us.

You can also imagine that a law firm that has meeting rooms, with someone who wants to form a local #valzubiriagenda group, can have meetings. A local café can do the same. Local photographers for your art, writers, editors, book designers, proofreaders and others can join in.

I suggest have printed books to share. 15 copies of your memoir or art books will be better than an e-reader or laptop or your phone to show. These gadgets can be stolen, sabotaged, broken, have coffee spilled on them, etc. 15 printed books means simultaneously showing to 15 people. You can even give them away to potential resellers, investors, traders and collectors.

**When it rains, it pours, as in the days of Noah**

There's a saying, ""When it rains, it pours."" There is a negative interpretation and a positive interpretation.

*Negative:* When trouble comes, they cascade to even more.

***Positive:*** When opportunity comes knocking, more follow suit. We can assume that if one gets our art because of #valzubiriagenda, more want to do it now, because of the rising prices, and FOMO - fear of missing out. What will they lose if they miss the boat?

As I have said earlier, if the #valzubiriagenda trends, if you announce a future memoir or art catalog, you might have an increase of investors, traders and art collectors who would want to check you out. You might encourage more sales. Just remember to write and publish that memoir and art catalog.

There's this saying, ""As in the days of Noah."" Imagine Noah, building his ark, with members of his own family, putting all his time and effort into it. Noah was a nice guy. I'm sure every once in a while a neighbor offered him coffee, or chai latte, or whatever refreshing drink they might have back then.

Here's the lesson to be learned. Just because they offered him some type of bubble tea drink, or coca cola, they still didn't make it to the ark. Rubbing shoulders with actors does not make you an actor. I have told my artist friends to write their memoirs. They told me that once they see me succeed, after all these many years of seeing my seemingly useless efforts, then they will write their memoirs and follow the road that I had paved for them.

Good luck to them, but if I were you, act now, get my art or make art. Support the 5-year old artist whose parent promised to release a comprehensive art catalog. If you get that 5-year old's art, and mine, I would be honored to be in the same art catalog that you will produce. I'm already successful at that point. You have gotten the mission just right.

I have already claimed to have written the most book-length artist memoirs in the world. Dethrone that claim. Barter. Use ghostwriters. Success to me means facing God one day and saying, I wrote my memoirs and left the world a legacy of books and art. I will not tell God, smiling and proudly, that I encouraged a run for my art by announcing a schedule of exponentially increasing prices that reached 9 figures. I'm sure God knows we had fun.

1lbizkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lastofuspart2/comments/1lbizkk/my_thoughts_after_2_playthroughs_of_the_game/,My thoughts after 2 playthroughs of the game,"First what I love about the game. 

.All the actors do an amazing job. 

.The music and sound design is awesome. As someone who shoots guns, having guns sound like guns is refreshing. Both the voice actors for Ellie and Joel give amazing performances when they are singing.

.Gameplay wise they did the smart move and just take last of us 1 and improved upon it. Them making Ellie's and Abby's gameplay similar but different enough to add spic was a good call.

. All of the boss fights were really well done. My favorite being Ellie.

.I enjoyed the world building. A rebel organization that became worse than the people they overthrow versus a cult that are straying from their original teachings after their prophet died is really interesting 

Minor things that annoyed me

.Yara and Levs House has 3 people living in it and has 2 beds 

. I enjoyed the open world section. I'm a little annoyed that they only did that for one level

. Mel tourniquets Joel wrong. You're not supposed to do it on the wound you're supposed to do it above it. To cut off blood flow and stop the bleeding. Mel should have know this as a medic.

Major things that not only annoyed but also took me out of the experience 

. There's one level when the WLF were trying to hunt you down in a subway and there's both clickers and WLF there. I tried making them fight each other and then finish off the survivors by throwing bricks in the direction of the WLF. Took me like 5 tries to realize the clickers are programmed to b line for you no matter what. That was very annoying.

. Mel shouldnt have been pregnant. I understand what they were going for there. It was supposed to make Abbies and Ellie's stories parallel and make Ellie realize what she became when she killed Mel. 

  The problem is it makes other parts of the game make no sense. I already went over this in other posts so I won't dwell on it. Who signed off a pregnant woman going through a warzone? And yes I was paying attention they said multiple times through dialogue and a letter that the area they were going through was an active war zone with ambushes becoming increasingly common. And now that I think about why would they allow a truck with only 3 people in it to go through? With the amount of fighting going on they should have been convoys. Making her not pregnant would have changed almost nothing and was just a dumb decision.

. I said earlier that I enjoyed the world building. It's really good on the surface, the problem is when you start thinking about stuff.

The WLF should have inherited all of the equipment and factories to build the equipment(mentioned in the first game) from Fedra and military after they took over Seattle. Why are they so under equiped? You're telling me the organization that meticulouslly strips entire areas of supplies didn't grab any body armor from all the dead Fedra agents we see? You're telling me they don't care about the artillery that we know the military had in Seattle? If you wanna say it's for gameplay reasons that's fine have an elite unit that we see during the battle of Haven be equipped with body armor and assault rifles like the fireflies were in the first game. But no Issac and the people next him are going into battle with pistols and for some reason the Slavers in Santa Barbara are better equipped than the WLF.

How have the scars lost the concept of a pun? That's universal cultural thing that doesn't just go away. How is Lev so ignorant about slang from outside of the Scars. They have new members coming in and have not changed their language almost at all from other groups so they aren't that isolated. This is just stupid.

And yes some of this could extend to the first game 


The biggest problem with the game that brings down the whole thing.

The character writing. This story of this game is very dependent on it. The main issue is most of the new characters are poorly written. The only new characters that I can say is are characters are Manny who honestly is a bit of a stereotype, Owen, Abbies dad and maybe Issac. Lev and Jesse have foundations of a good character. Abby, Dina and Yara have no personality. And Mel is whole thing. Let me break it down.

I'm going to start not with a new character but a returning one. Joel's defining character trait is his and his family's survival at all cost. The moment he noticed Abby's group didn't exactly like him he should have been on guard. Wouldn't have changed much about the scene but him just going ""Why does it look like you guys know me' and not fighting back when they shot him and then start grabbing him is very out of character. You could make the argument that he went soft after being in Jackson for so long but if that's the case we should have been told or shown that he did.

Next paragraph has minor spoilers for God of War Ragnarok.

For Lev I understand what they were going for with his character. The kid making big mistakes that have serious consequences. That normally would be fine, I enjoyed Atreus from God of war Ragnarok for example. The difference between Lev and Atreus is Atreus's mistake was completely out of ignorance and Levs was not. Atreus thought he was helping an animal tied up, had a friend agreeing with him and just wasnt thinking when he did it. After he made the mistake he helped fix it. Lev was told what he did would get people killed and did it anyways when there was other options. He not only did this not only once but twice. Both his sister and mother are dead because of him just refusing to listen. Ya he feels bad about it but does nothing to make up it. I hear a lot of people on this sub say they really like this character and I honestly can't understand why. His only character traits are being stupid, I guess being a rebel and being trans. There's not much else besides having some skills he got from growing up being a scar which is more of a quirk than a trait.

Jesse I feel like would have been a good character if they gave him more screen time. His defining trait seems to be being a dumbass and honestly it was enjoyable. The problem is there's not much besides that, most of the rest of his dialogue is stuff you can almost anyone say and I felt almost nothing when he died because of that.

Abby has quirks that people mistake for traits. Quirks are fine, Joel loves coffee for example and to the games credit Abby's quirks do affect gameplay and the story. Fear of heights is a good example. Other than a couple quirks she's very bland which is a major problem in this story. The entire story is built around you forgiving her for brutally murdering Joel and she doesn't have the personality to make you like her enough to forgive her.

I have no idea what they were going for with Dina. The only trait I can think of is her nestogia for the pre outbreak and I guess being Jewish. I can not think of any other traits at all.

Yara is just a scar protecting her brother. That's it.

Mel is inconsistent. What I can say is she is a strong independent woman. They have that trait down. She's shown to be very compassionate towards the scars, no longer wanting to fight them and thinking self defense against their children was wrong but at the same time she wants Ellie's executed? Like is she ok with all the brutal violence or not? Why does she tell Abby she's a terrible person and is trying to trick Owen into thinking otherwise? She could have just said you're not coming on the boat because you're a homewrecker and that would make total sense but from what we see in the interactions between Abby and Mel we have not been shown a single time where Abby was being a terrible person around Mel other than maybe the Brutal execution of Joel but she was basically all for killing him so I'm not sure.

Really with most of these characters the issues I listed could have been fixed by just giving them more time to develop.


Overall the game with all its flaws is still very enjoyable and AI would recommend it.

1lbiyj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1lbiyj4/tip_always_use_me_messages/,"[Tip] Always use ""me"" messages","Hi all! I hope I am at the right place. Please let me know if I should post somewhere else.

In the past few years, I have done a lot of inner work and learnt a lot about myself and changed for the better. I am still work in progress, but I feel like I improved a lot.

Today I want to give you a little tip that could save you a lot of issues in your relationships, be it marriage, friendships, job environment or family.

The lesson is about ""me"" messages and expressing boundaries in a healthy way.

Lets start with obvious - all relationships are formed based on free will of both parties to engage in relationship. Otherwise, we are talking about abuse/tyranny, and that is not good.

From that, you should observe the following - you absolutely have right to, and should, have standards of what you want in relationship with someone and what not. It is called a boundary.

At the same time, you can not and should never force someone to behave certain way or feel entitled to make someone behave one way or another.

Example: I can set a boundary to be in a relationship based on trust. At the same time, I can not force someone to not cheat, it is their choice. But it is my choice not to be with such partner. You got the idea.

This is obvious for most. What we make mistake more often is - communication.

Imagine scenario in which you have disagreement with someone. For example, your boyfriend always leaves socks around the room. (scenario 1). Or your wife goes out to hang out with her male friend. (scenario 2).

Mistake (what not to do) - talk about other person behaviour in negative way. If you say to your imaginary boyfriend (scenario 1), for example: ""You again left your socks on table. You do that all the time, and despite I already told you this, you never change."", he will get defensive. Same goes if you tell your wife ""to not go out with these guys anymore.""

Why is that so? Because by doing so, you are trying to inforce rules on them. They feel like you are trying to change them, and their ego goes in protective mode. They feel like you forcefully wanna change their behaviour and will get defensive and return with conflict. Even worse thing you can do is treating other person or giving an ultimatum: ""if you keep doing this, I am gonna leave."" (scenario 1), or ""okay, if you go out with this guy, I will also go out with my girl friend"" (scenario 2).

What to do instead? Communicate from your perspective about how certain act made you feel and set boundaries. Good example (scenario 1): ""When you leave socks around, I feel like you do not respect the time I take to clean. I do not want to be in relationship in which I feel disrespected."" For scenario 2: ""When you go out with your guy friends, I feel neglected as we do not spend enough time together. I am fine if you go out for a coffee with that guy here and there, but I think it is inconsiderate when you go to his home place.""

Notice that the only possible response to this is: ""okay, I understand"". Basically, by doing this, you set boundaries and decline further argument. You position yourself, and with that, other person plays his own cards. You set your boundary, and it is their choice to respect them or not. And yours to be or not be in such relationship.

You can always chose what you are okay and not with, but not force behavioural change of others.",2,1749934714.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

	•	She finds a diary revealing she’s been unknowingly poisoning her husband with cyanide in his coffee.

So I bought a bambino but haven’t opened it yet because I’m scared to hate it. I use to use a Keurig with a metal kcup and chose my own coffee, which I use lifeboost (it actually taste so amazing). But I am a coffee jerk, I genuinely care about the taste. I noticed a lot of people suggest getting a grinder, the only caveat is I only have the space for my machine (I rent and my roomie uses the other outlet for their machine), so if anything I’m leaning heavily towards a manual grinder. But what hand grinder should I get? I don’t wanna spend an arm and a leg but something that will be consistent?

OR the other question I have, lifeboost had an espresso ground coffee. Does anyone have any experience with that roast and think it makes a good shot? Also I think I should upgrade the tamp and get a bottomless portafilter. I really just don’t wanna hate this machine and want to love it as much as I love drinking espresso or lattes.

1lbixft,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lbixft,1 Furnished Bedroom in a 3 BR Apt - Park Slope - $1900/mo (Utilities Included),"Start Date: July 1, 2025    
Length: 1 year (7/1/2025 - 6/30/2026)    
Rent: $1,900 (monthly)  



The Location: Located in the heart of Park Slope on a quiet, tree-lined street. We’re just around the corner from bars, restaurants and cafes. Soccer fields, basketball courts, a skate park, and handball courts are all within 2 blocks. Necessities like a grocery store and laundromat are 1.5 blocks away. On Sundays the farmer’s market is a 3 minute walk and the big Saturday Grand Army Plaza farmer’s market is in the neighborhood. Prospect Park is under a 20 minute walk, bringing you Celebrate Brooklyn concerts at the bandshell, shaded eating spots at the picnic house, and skating at the LaFrak Center. Also nearby are the Brooklyn Public Library, Museum, and Botanical Garden. Essentially, if you look for the most charming Park Slope location on RentLingo’s ‘Charm Index’ map, we’re right in the middle of it!



The Apartment: The apartment itself is a walk up 1 flight of stairs to the 2nd floor of the building. With windows in every room, hardwood floors beneath you, and an assortment of paintings on the wall, this is a space that is meant to feel like you've arrived home. It has a kitchen, living-dining room, bathroom, and three bedrooms. The apartment is about a 5 minute walk from the F/R/G (and late nights, N/D as well) and about 20 minutes from the B/D, 2/3, 4/5, and R/N/Q trains. If you like cycling, there's a Citibike station just 1 block away from us.



The Room: Full-size master bedroom of 11 x 11 feet with additional closet space across the whole of one wall. It features a large window that provides plenty of natural light. The room comes furnished with a full sized bed, a desk, and one black dresser.



Common Space: Fully furnished with couch, coffee table, dining table/chairs. The kitchen is well stocked with items necessary (cutlery / dishes / pots & pans) and fun (wok / wine rack / slow cooker) for shared use.



Utilities: Internet, electricity, gas, hot water, and heat will be included with the rent. 



Us: You would share the apartment with 2\* professionals: two women. One works in IT as a developer. She likes heading into the neighborhood for yoga, enjoys painting, and has recently taken up vocal lessons. One is a customer support manager with an education degree. She enjoys cooking, board games, and the occasional hike when it's nice out. We are friendly, respectful and have social lives outside of the house. \*The latter travels a fair bit so will be away quite often. When she is around, very occasionally, the apartment is filled with tiny roommates: foster kittens from the ASPCA.



You: Someone accustomed to living with roommates who is looking to join a cozy apartment. Someone who is enthusiastic about what they’re doing in life and shares that joy with others! We are asking that you are clean, tidy, respectful of community areas/items, and happy to pitch into house chores. We are happy to meet your occasional visitors, but no live-in guests please. Feel free to have a crazy night life, but keep that nightlife outside of the apartment. LGBTQ+/GSRM friendly. Non-smokers only.



To move in: You will need to provide 1) identification 2) proof of income/employment 3) first month’s rent and one month security.



Interested in this room? Send a direct message telling us a little about yourself and what brings you here. Let us know if you’re interested in meeting in-person or via video chat if you’re not in NYC (send along a link to a social media profile if so).

So here I am — 31, in California, newly divorced, and bravely venturing into the world of dating, which apparently now includes ghosting, breadcrumbing, and whatever else reddit is warning me about. Love that for us singles 🙃. 

The truth? I’m someone who knows how to be a partner — I love hard, care deeply, remember how you take your coffee, and will 100% save you the last fry (okay, *probably*). But it turns out that kind of emotional availability is, uh… not exactly appealing? 

I miss real connection — the kind where we know each other’s weird little quirks.
Like:
🌯 What’s your 11pm snack run order?
📺 What do you throw on when you can’t sleep (and are you a “true crime 'til I pass out” type or more of a classic DCOM zone)?
🙋‍♀️ Do you like head rubs or am I just weirdly enthusiastic about giving/receiving them?

I’m not into speedrunning through relationships. I like slow-burn vibes. I want to get to know someone, let it unfold naturally, and if it turns into something amazing? Even better.

About me:
🧩 Jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, word games 
📖 Reading, hiking, beach days, swimming, camping, road trips — I’m happiest near trees or water.
😺 I have cats. They’re judgmental and dramatic. It’s fine. They are friendly just big pussies 😉
🎥 I love the movies and hanging out with people who know how to both chill & have deep talks.

If you’re emotionally available, kind of funny, and looking for someone who’ll care about you *on purpose*, message me. We’ll exchange intros and pics and see where it goes.

Worst case, you get solid head rub in your future and snack recs. Best case, who knows?

1lbivah,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1lbivah/what_makes_fxjqoor_floating_hair_filtering_mesh/,What Makes FXJQOOR Floating Hair Filtering Mesh the Best Lint Remover Review?,"Testing out the FXJQOOR 1 Floating Hair Filtering Mesh Lint Remover was an unexpected experience. At first glance, it seemed like the kind of quirky laundry gadget you’d find when doom-scrolling online late at night, but let me be honest—I wasn’t expecting much from it. As someone who has a hefty laundry load thanks to my shedding dog, Oliver, and my long-haired roommate, tackling lint and stray hairs is an ongoing battle. This little contraption had high expectations to live up to. Its promise of catching hair and lint in the washing machine sounded straight out of a TV infomercial. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t *entirely* smoke and mirrors.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The design of this floating mesh lint remover is something I didn’t know I’d appreciate as much as I did. Essentially, it’s made from lightweight, colorful materials that float on top of the water in your machine. The mesh is conical and feels sturdy enough to withstand regular use. Its size is compact yet noticeable enough that it didn’t get lost in my pile of laundry. Toss it into the machine, and the gadget floats just at the surface, which, as the name suggests, targets all the gunk that rises to the top. Every time I looked at it in action, I couldn’t help but think it resembled some kind of buoy on vacation in soapy water.

[Check FXJQOOR 1 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0dyd9qxcf/)  

**Ease of Use**  
I have to hand it to the FXJQOOR 1 Floating Hair Filtering Mesh Lint Remover—it was ridiculously simple to use. No complicated instructions or pre-set settings here. You literally just drop it into your washing machine and let the machine handle the rest. After the wash, removing the accumulated lint and hair from the mesh was surprisingly satisfying. A quick rinse, and it was ready for another round. No batteries, no software updates—just pure simplicity. However, I noticed it wasn’t a perfect system. While some larger clusters of dog hair and lint were snagged, finer debris seemed to evade capture.

**Effectiveness in Cleaning**  
This lint remover worked decently well in capturing visible debris from my laundry. My clothes, especially dark-colored ones, noticeably benefitted. Those annoying dog hairs that cling desperately to every sweater? The remover did catch a lot of them. That said, it wasn’t foolproof. Not all stray hairs managed to find their way into the mesh. Clothes with finer materials like silk barely saw much improvement. I wouldn’t call this a game-changer, but it’s definitely a step up from relying solely on washing machine filters.

**Highlights**  
- Captures floating lint and visible hair effectively.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-use design.  
- Reusable, sustainable construction.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with finer hair particles.  
- Occasionally tangles in bulkier clothes.  

**Material and Sustainability**  
One thing I noticed is the device’s reusability, which earns it points for sustainability. Constructed from durable materials, it holds up well across multiple washing cycles. After each use, I’d rinse it under the tap, and it’d be ready to go again. There’s satisfaction in knowing I wasn’t throwing another disposable plastic product into the environment after every wash. However, it left me curious about how long it could withstand the rigors of weekly laundries before wear and tear rendered it ineffective.

**Competitive Options**  
At its core, this little gadget is up against other lint-catching solutions like dryer sheets or even high-end washing machines with built-in lint traps. Unlike high-efficiency washing machine filters that tackle hair from start to finish, this device is more rudimentary, leaving a portion of debris untouched. On the flip side, dryer sheets—definitely cheaper—are disposable, which feels less eco-friendly. Also, while powered lint traps score in effectiveness, their price tags make the FXJQOOR 1 look like a steal. For casual “intermediate” users like me, this mesh filter seems well-positioned.

**True Value**  
Given what this hair catcher offers, I’d call it an affordable laundry experiment at its worst and a convenient cleaning hack at its best. It’s not groundbreaking, but for the price, it’s a reasonable fun addition to your laundry arsenal. My wardrobe has seen improvements, especially my all-black and dark blue ensemble that’s regularly plagued by lint and animal fluff. Would I skip my morning coffee buying one of these again? Probably. But if you’re not expecting miracles, this is worth trying just for the novelty value.

Prospect Park is under a 20 minute walk, bringing you Celebrate Brooklyn concerts at the bandshell, shaded eating spots at the picnic house, and skating at the LaFrak Center. Also nearby are the Brooklyn Public Library, Museum, and Botanical Garden. Essentially, if you look for the most charming Park Slope location on RentLingo’s ‘Charm Index’ map, we’re right in the middle of it!



The Apartment: The apartment itself is a walk up 1 flight of stairs to the 2nd floor of the building. With windows in every room, hardwood floors beneath you, and an assortment of paintings on the wall, this is a space that is meant to feel like you've arrived home. It has a kitchen, living-dining room, bathroom, and three bedrooms. The apartment is about a 5 minute walk from the F/R/G (and late nights, N/D as well) and about 20 minutes from the B/D, 2/3, 4/5, and R/N/Q trains. If you like cycling, there's a Citibike station just 1 block away from us.



The Room: Full-size master bedroom of 11 x 11 feet with additional closet space across the whole of one wall. It features a large window that provides plenty of natural light. The room comes furnished with a full sized bed, a desk, and one black dresser.



Common Space: Fully furnished with couch, coffee table, dining table/chairs. The kitchen is well stocked with items necessary (cutlery / dishes / pots & pans) and fun (wok / wine rack / slow cooker) for shared use.



Utilities: Internet, electricity, gas, hot water, and heat will be included with the rent. 



Us: You would share the apartment with 2\* professionals: two women. One works in IT as a developer. She likes heading into the neighborhood for yoga, enjoys painting, and has recently taken up vocal lessons. One is a customer support manager with an education degree. She enjoys cooking, board games, and the occasional hike when it's nice out. We are friendly, respectful and have social lives outside of the house. \*The latter travels a fair bit so will be away quite often. When she is around, very occasionally, the apartment is filled with tiny roommates: foster kittens from the ASPCA.



You: Someone accustomed to living with roommates who is looking to join a cozy apartment. Someone who is enthusiastic about what they’re doing in life and shares that joy with others! We are asking that you are clean, tidy, respectful of community areas/items, and happy to pitch into house chores. We are happy to meet your occasional visitors, but no live-in guests please. Feel free to have a crazy night life, but keep that nightlife outside of the apartment. LGBTQ+/GSRM friendly. Non-smokers only.



To move in: You will need to provide 1) identification 2) proof of income/employment 3) first month’s rent and one month security.

Diagnose Your Digital Nomad Income Potential in under 90 seconds! [Try the free tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Welcome to the Digital Jungle

Paper is dead. Or at least, it’s gasping for air, buried under a mountain of sticky notes, coffee stains, and lost ideas. Analog chaos is a relic—digital notebooks are the new sheriffs in town, promising order, speed, and a memory that never forgets.

But here’s the catch: not all digital notebooks are created equal. Some are shiny distractions. Others are productivity powerhouses. The question: which one actually deserves your brain?

**_🔥 Want to know your digital nomad earning potential? Diagnose it instantly with this free tool! [Check it out now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### The Anatomy of a Digital Notebook

What makes a digital notebook more than just a glorified Word doc? It’s the fusion of features—sync that works, search that’s psychic, and a UI that doesn’t make you want to throw your laptop out the window.

Cloud storage is the backbone. Real-time sync is the nervous system. Offline access? That’s your emergency parachute. If your notes can’t follow you everywhere, you’re living in the past.

### The Titans: Top Digital Notebook Platforms

Let’s name names. Evernote, the OG, built the playground. Notion, the shape-shifter, bends to your will. OneNote, Microsoft’s underdog, quietly dominates the enterprise. Google Keep, the minimalist’s sticky note. Obsidian, the dark horse for the power-obsessed.

Each has its cult. Each has its flaws. The only constant? Choice is power.

**_🌍 On the move? Find out how much you could be earning as a digital nomad—free 90-second assessment! [Discover your potential.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

#### Evernote: The OG Heavyweight

Evernote is the granddaddy. Web clipper, robust search, and a familiar green elephant. But it’s been accused of bloat, price hikes, and feature creep. Still, for those who want everything in one place—notes, PDFs, images—it’s a fortress.

#### Notion: The Modular Disruptor

Notion is the Swiss Army knife. Pages, databases, kanban boards, and wild customization. It’s as simple or complex as you want. But beware: with great power comes great confusion. Notion can be a rabbit hole for the easily distracted.

#### OneNote: Microsoft’s Secret Weapon

OneNote is the silent assassin. Free for most, deeply integrated with Office, and shockingly flexible. If you’re already in the Microsoft ecosystem, it’s a no-brainer. Handwriting support is top-notch. But the interface? Love it or hate it.

#### Google Keep: Minimalist’s Paradise

Google Keep is the sticky note reimagined. Lightning-fast, voice notes, color-coded simplicity. No learning curve. But don’t expect deep organization or advanced features. It’s for quick capture, not deep dives.

#### Obsidian: The Power-User’s Playground

Obsidian is for the thinkers. Markdown-based, local-first, and obsessed with linking ideas. It’s the Zettelkasten nerd’s paradise. But it’s not for the faint-hearted. There’s a learning curve, but the payoff is mind-bending flexibility.

**_💡 Want to know your digital nomad income ceiling? Diagnose it for free—takes less than 90 seconds! [Try the tool now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Battle-Tested: Real-World Use Cases

The traveler needs offline access and ruthless sync. The creative needs infinite space for wild ideas. The corporate warrior needs bulletproof organization and collaboration.

No single notebook wins every battle. The best tool is the one that fits your life, not the other way around.

### Device Compatibility: Anywhere, Everywhere, or Bust

If your notebook can’t jump from phone to laptop to tablet, it’s dead weight. Evernote, OneNote, and Notion all play nice across devices. Obsidian is catching up, but Google Keep is the king of “grab-and-go.”

### User Experience: Friction or Flow?

Cluttered interfaces kill ideas. Evernote and OneNote can feel busy. Notion is clean but can get complex fast. Google Keep is zen-like. Obsidian is utilitarian—no frills, just power.

Learning curve matters. Some want plug-and-play. Others crave customization. Know thyself.

**_🌟 Unleash your digital nomad earning potential—free, instant diagnosis! [Get started now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Organization Systems: Chaos Tamed or Multiplied?

Tags, folders, backlinks. Evernote loves stacks. Notion lets you build your own universe. Obsidian is a web of interlinked thought. Google Keep? Labels and colors, nothing more.

The right system tames chaos. The wrong one multiplies it. Choose wisely.

### Collaboration: Lone Wolf or Pack Animal?

Notion and OneNote shine for teams. Real-time editing, comments, permissions. Evernote lags behind. Google Keep is for soloists. Obsidian? Lone wolf territory—unless you hack it.

### Offline Access: The Digital Nomad’s Lifeline

Wi-Fi dies. Great ideas shouldn’t. OneNote and Evernote have solid offline modes. Notion is catching up, but beware the cloud trap. Obsidian is local-first—your notes, your machine, no strings attached.

### Security and Privacy: Who’s Reading Your Brain?

Encryption is non-negotiable. Evernote and OneNote encrypt in transit, but not end-to-end. Obsidian keeps everything local—paranoia-friendly. Notion and Google Keep? Trust the cloud, or don’t.

**_🚀 Ready to see your digital nomad income potential? Diagnose it in 90 seconds—free! [Take the test now.](https://nomadincomedetector.gleam.ink/)_**

### Integration Ecosystem: Playing Nice With Others

Zapier, IFTTT, Slack, Google Drive. Notion and Evernote are integration monsters. OneNote is a Microsoft loyalist. Google Keep? Minimal. Obsidian relies on plugins—powerful, but DIY.

### Pricing: Free Lunch or Wallet Drain?

Evernote charges for power. Notion is free for individuals, paid for teams. OneNote is free with Office. Google Keep is free, period. Obsidian is free unless you want sync. Know what you’re paying for.

### Storage Limits: How Big Is Your Digital Brain?

Evernote and Notion have caps on free plans. OneNote and Google Keep are generous. Obsidian is only limited by your hard drive.

### Customization: Your Notebook, Your Rules

Themes, templates, widgets. Notion is a blank canvas. Obsidian is a hacker’s playground. Evernote and OneNote offer less flair, more structure. Google Keep is what it is—no more, no less.

### Search Superpowers: Finding Needles in Haystacks

Evernote’s search is legendary. OCR, handwriting, attachments—no problem. Notion and OneNote are strong, but a step behind. Obsidian is fast, especially with plugins. Google Keep is basic—good luck with volume.

### The Pain of Migration: Can You Switch Without Tears?

Exporting notes is a minefield. Evernote and OneNote play nice with each other. Notion imports most formats. Obsidian is markdown—future-proof. Google Keep? Prepare for pain.

### Support and Community: Who’s Got Your Back?

Official support is hit or miss. Notion and Obsidian have rabid user communities. Evernote and OneNote are corporate—expect ticket systems. Google Keep is a Google product—blink and it could disappear.

### Sustainability: Will Your Notes Outlive the App?

Apps die. Companies pivot. Local storage (Obsidian) is safest. Evernote and OneNote are established but not immortal. Notion is hot now, but who knows? Google Keep—well, Google kills products for sport.

### The Verdict: Best Digital Notebook for Every Archetype

- The minimalist: Google Keep. Fast, simple, no fuss.
- The power user: Obsidian. Infinite customization, total control.
- The collaboration junkie: Notion. Real-time teamwork, endless structure.
- The privacy zealot: Obsidian. Local-first, no cloud required.
- The corporate climber: OneNote. Deep Office integration, reliable.

### Final Thoughts: The Only Rule—Don’t Settle

Your notes are your intellectual capital. Don’t hand them to the wrong platform. Test, break, rebuild. The best digital notebook is the one that makes you unstoppable. Refuse to settle for less.",1,1749934410.0,NomadicLifestyleGlobe,0,1.0,False
1lbitzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thoughts4Today/comments/1lbitzb/when_the_silence_feels_like_rejection/,When the Silence Feels Like Rejection,"Earlier today, I opened one of my devotionals. The reading landed in Lamentations—Jeremiah’s raw, unfiltered grief poured out onto the page. It’s not a book people usually highlight or quote on a coffee mug. Most of it feels like sitting in the ashes after the fire’s gone out. No sugarcoating. No polite prayers. Just pain.

Then I read this:

> *“Even when I cry and shout, He shuts out my prayer.”* (Lamentations 3:8, NKJV)

That verse wrecked me. Because I’ve felt that.
Haven’t you?

You pour your heart out to God. You cry. You shout. You beg. And in return? Nothing. Just silence. Stillness. Like your words never made it past the ceiling.

Jeremiah gets it.
He doesn’t pretend.
He said, *“My strength and my hope have perished from the Lord.”* (v. 18)

That’s not poetic despair. That’s spiritual exhaustion.
He was wiped out—physically, emotionally, spiritually.

But that’s not where he stays.

Right in the middle of that valley, a flicker of hope breaks through:

> *“This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope:
Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed,
Because His compassions fail not.
They are new every morning;
Great is Your faithfulness.”* (Lamentations 3:21–23, NKJV)

That’s not denial.
That’s defiant, blood-and-tears kind of faith.

Jeremiah isn’t ignoring the pain. He’s remembering the truth.
And sometimes that’s the fight—not to feel better, but to recall what’s still true when everything else is falling apart.

> *“For the Lord will not cast off forever.
Though He causes grief,
Yet He will show compassion
According to the multitude of His mercies.”* (Lamentations 3:31–32)

Fast forward centuries, and Paul—beaten, shipwrecked, imprisoned—writes from a place of deep experience:

> *“For I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
nor angels nor principalities nor powers,
nor things present nor things to come,
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing,
shall be able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”* (Romans 8:38–39, NKJV)

What Jeremiah and Paul both knew—and what I needed to be reminded of today—is that God’s silence is not God’s absence.

You may not feel His hand.
You may not hear His voice.
But His love has never left you.

You are not alone.
You are not abandoned.
You are still loved.

Fast forward centuries, and Paul—beaten, shipwrecked, imprisoned—writes from a place of deep experience:

> *“For I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
nor angels nor principalities nor powers,
nor things present nor things to come,
nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing,
shall be able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”* (Romans 8:38–39, NKJV)

What Jeremiah and Paul both knew—and what I needed to be reminded of today—is that God’s silence is not God’s absence.

You may not feel His hand.
You may not hear His voice.
But His love has never left you.

You are not alone.
You are not abandoned.
You are still loved.

I’m 28, based in the UK, and no, I don’t actually go around saying, 'right, what’s all this then?' If that joke or meme is a mystery to you, feel free to ignore my nonsense lol. It’d be lovely to find something that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I’m a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I’ll get back into reading history, but so far it’s mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list I never followed. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. 😀 If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. For me, amazing conversations are when we forget about time, doesn't matter whether it's serious or lighthearted, the next thing we know, it's been hours. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully sparks fly.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start already. 😀",1,1749934184.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1lbiqpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDmeds/comments/1lbiqpe/facial_twitching_on_vyvanse_30mganyone_else/,Facial twitching on Vyvanse 30mg—anyone else experience this?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been on Vyvanse for 8 weeks now and recently developed facial twitching—mostly around my mouth and chin. I started at 20mg for the first 3 weeks and then got bumped up to 30mg, which I’ve been on for the past 5 weeks.

At 20mg, I noticed a clearer head and better dopamine balance, but it was wearing off too early in the day, so the dose was increased. Now that I’m in school, I feel hyper-focused and very alert—locked in on the teacher and the material.

But I’ve noticed something strange: when I’m really focused, especially on people (like my teacher or classmates), I start getting involuntary facial twitches. I have a history of anxiety, especially around people due to some past trust issues. I’ve learned to manage my emotions better, but now I sometimes feel almost “emotionally frozen.” I’ll feel something inside—calm, happy, frustrated—but on the outside, I’m blank.

It’s like I’ve trained myself not to show emotion because in the past, expressing them (especially before I knew I had ADHD) often led to judgment or misunderstandings. Now, if I feel emotional during class—especially when I don’t understand something or feel frustrated—my face starts to twitch like I’m holding in a cry or an outburst. It’s like sadness and aggression are stuck trying to come out at once.

Same thing happens when I feel happy and try not to smile—my mouth twitches involuntarily. It’s honestly really frustrating and awkward. I think people around me notice, which just adds to my anxiety.

I’m going to stop drinking coffee before school to see if that helps. I wonder if I’m just overstimulated. I feel fine when I’m alone, but around people, I freeze and get anxious.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I’ve seen posts about eye twitching or scalp twitching on stimulants, but this facial stuff feels different and really disruptive.

The microwave made a noise like it was dying. Again.

Owen Blake leaned against the counter in his robe, arms folded, staring at the little digital countdown as if daring it to detonate. His socks mismatched, one sporting a hole near the toe slid slightly on the laminate floor every time he shifted his weight.

From the living room, the television buzzed at low volume: “Tonight on Channel 5, Senator Ellison denies knowing about...”

He didn’t change the channel. Or move. The burrito turned slowly behind the greasy microwave door, encased in a thin halo of flickering blue light. Owen sniffed. He wasn’t sure if it was the burrito or the dying plant in the corner that smelled vaguely like feet.

“Gourmet,” he muttered.

The kitchen was a landscape of functional defeat. A graveyard of Amazon boxes. A stack of paper plates tilting like a papier-mâché Leaning Tower of Pisa. One fork. The kind of place that felt temporary, even though he’d been here six years.

His phone lit up with a notification on the counter. He didn’t look. Probably another alert about an influencer meltdown or a limited-time deal on vitamin supplements.

The microwave beeped.

Owen peeled open the door. Steam. The burrito sagged like it had given up halfway through cooking. He plucked it from the plate and gave it a test bounce in his palm.

Hot. Barely.

He carried it into the living room and dropped onto the couch with a tired grunt, tossing a balled-up hoodie aside like it personally offended him. The TV now showed a clip of protestors throwing glitter on a man in a suit.

“…the senator insists he was not aware of civilian protesters before ordering…”

Owen took a bite of burrito. Chewed. Stared ahead.

“This,” he said to the empty room, “is the peak of human civilization. Bland food and shitty governments.”

He swallowed and sighed. The burrito burned his tongue, but not enough to be interesting. He rubbed at his face and glanced toward the window. The night beyond looked like a smudge. Not even the moon bothered to show up.

Then there it was.

A light.

Faint at first. Pulsing. Not streetlamp-yellow, but a pale blue-white, like a distant lightning bug had gotten very ambitious.

Owen blinked. Took another bite.

The microwave, still open, gave a little buzz. The TV flickered. The light outside his window pulsed again, brighter this time, closer—like it was waiting.

“…Huh,” Owen said.

And then the air began to hum.

The hum was subtle at first like someone had left a distant air conditioner running inside a whale. Owen looked around, slowly chewing. The TV screen fizzled into static, and the microwave beeped without instruction, showing 88:88.

He raised one eyebrow. “Okay,” he said flatly, “either I’m having a stroke, or the house just subscribed to paranormal cable.”

The light outside intensified, shining through the blinds in rhythmic pulses. He got up, burrito still in hand, and shuffled to the window.

It wasn’t a helicopter. No blades. No engine. The glow moved in a slow, measured spiral, like it was... searching.

“Oh great,” Owen mumbled. “The NSA finally saw my browser history.”

He backed away from the glass just as a high-pitched chime began to whine from every electronic device in the apartment. His alarm clock turned red. His smart speaker whispered something in Sanskrit. The plant in the corner dead since March shivered.

And then the walls sighed.

Owen dropped the burrito.

He floated half a foot off the ground.

At first, he assumed it was vertigo. Or carbon monoxide poisoning. But then the couch began to drift too. The microwave tray slid out and hovered, spinning lazily.

“Okay. Sure. Cool,” Owen said, flailing uselessly midair. “Figures. I finally lose my grip and my brain rewards me with a furniture-themed purgatory”

The light brilliant now beamed straight through his ceiling, wrapping him in a warm, magnetic grip. He yelled, tried to kick his way back to Earth. But it was like the air had thickened. Like being scooped up in a soft but insistent hand.

As the room dissolved in brightness, the last thing he saw was the sad, steaming burrito lying limp on the carpet, its filling leaking out like it too had given up.

The ceiling opened like paper set on fire silent, curling, light pouring through the cracks.

Owen screamed. Not because of pain there was none but because it seemed like the thing to do when your apartment began dissolving overhead and your legs weren’t touching the floor.

Bookshelves tipped. A bowl of loose keys spiraled by like metallic confetti. Somewhere, the smart speaker tried to play music, but only gave a loud buzz, and gave up.

“I knew it!” Owen yelled, twisting in midair as the gravity around his body softened into meaningless suggestion. “I knew this week the world was going to end!”

His voice echoed, even though there were no walls anymore. Just white. Infinite, indifferent white.

The floor disappeared beneath him, though he couldn’t say when. It was like one moment he was in his living room, and the next, he was drifting upward through an invisible column, his bathrobe fluttering, socks useless, arms reaching for nothing.

Static built in his ears. Not loud. More like pressure behind the eyes. His limbs tingled not pain, more like being very aware of blood, as if his body was whispering, Hey, you’re still here, just so you know.

Then

Everything stopped.

No movement. No wind. No sensation. Just Owen, floating in place in a blankness so complete it might as well have been a dream.

“…Okay,” he muttered.

He looked around. No up. No down. No sense of orientation. Just himself, his robe, and the faint odor of regret and bean burrito.

Then like a film reel switching reality clicked.

There was a floor. A soft, gently glowing surface formed beneath him, and he dropped onto it with a surprising boop, like a marshmallow landing on velvet. He bounced slightly.

The light dimmed.

And he saw them.

Two figures stood a few yards away humanoid in silhouette, bipedal, tall but that’s where familiarity ended.

Their skin was the color of bruised wax, translucent in places. Their veins looked as if they were drawn in with a dark ink. Joints bent too far, knees hinged backward. Arms like cockroach legs. One of them had no visible mouth just a loose flap of glistening tissue that fluttered when it moved. The other blinked with sideways eyelids that left a smear of milky fluid across its eyes.

They didn’t move aggressively. In fact, they stood quite still watching, like museum docents observing a particularly disappointing exhibit.

Owen blinked.

“…God, I hope you’re not Mormons.”

The taller alien stepped forward, its glow pulsing slightly as it did. The air around Owen shifted, warmer now. The room didn’t seem to have corners everything faded into softness.

The creature bowed its head just slightly, the way a professor might acknowledge a particularly hopeless student.

“I am Mira,” the voice said gently inside his skull. “This is Jael.”

Jael was still holding the sock, now pressed flat on the translucent clipboard in its claws like it was trying to preserve evidence from a crime scene. It offered no greeting, only gurgled softly and gave Owen a slow blink from its sideways eyelids.

Mira continued:

“We are explorers. Observers. Your presence here is entirely non-invasive.”

“You floated me through my ceiling,” Owen said.

“That was for efficiency.”

“You took my sock.”

“That was… interpretive.”

Owen sighed and rubbed his eyes. “Okay. Just so I’m clear this isn’t hell, right? Because the lighting’s better than I expected.”

Mira made a slow, wheezing sound that might’ve been laughter. Or indigestion.

“You are aboard a vessel designed for knowledge-sharing. We selected you because your cognitive output displays high frequency pessimistic oscillations.”

Owen stared. “That’s the nicest way anyone’s ever called me a bummer.”

Jael clicked its claws twice and a small hovering screen lit up beside it. A readout appeared: **“Owen Blake: Subject 1A – Mid-Level Disillusioned Earth Human.”**

Owen read the screen, then pointed at it. “I want that on a t-shirt.”

“We ask only to converse,” Mira said. “To understand how you perceive your world. You will not be harmed. You will not be dissected. You will not be probed.”

“That’s what the probe people always say.”

Mira tilted its head. “We lack… probing protocols.”

Jael, still silent, tapped on the screen and displayed what looked like a rapidly cycling slideshow of human images—cities, oceans, cats, wildfires, protest signs, a man falling off a trampoline.

“We have data,” Mira said. “But we lack context. We do not wish to judge. We only wish to… comprehend.”

Owen blinked. He scratched his head.

“Weird pick but whatever I guess.” he said slowly, “Y'all got pants?”

  
**Chapter 2: Welcome to the Deck of Inquiry**

The door behind Owen melted soundlessly into the wall, replaced by a hallway that curved as if the ship itself had never heard of straight lines.

Mira gestured not with a hand, but with a smooth unfolding of limb and glow. “This way, Owen Blake. To the Deck of Inquiry.”

Owen raised an eyebrow. “Is that before or after the Spa of Mild Terror?”

They didn’t answer. He followed.

The hallway lit itself one segment at a time as they walked, like it needed constant reminders of where people were. The walls had a gentle pulse to them biological, almost. The air was clean in a way that felt suspicious.

They entered a chamber that tried very, very hard to look like a living room.

Sort of.

There was furniture. At least, objects arranged at sitting height. But the chairs looked like abstract sculptures made of melted soap. One of them deflated slightly when Owen approached, like it was trying to sigh invitingly. Another one glowed purple.

A platform rose from the floor bearing what appeared to be a table made of pressed plant matter. At its center sat a steaming cup.

“Is that... coffee?” Owen asked, squinting at it.

Mira turned toward it with pride. “Based on your neural recall patterns of pleasure from grounded beans. Synthesized.”

He leaned closer. It smelled like vinegar and hot pennies.

Jael chirped something gleeful and pointed toward the nearest seat. Owen eyed it, then slowly lowered himself onto it.

It gave a wet *shlurrrk* sound and gently reshaped to cradle his entire body just slightly too intimately.

“It’s warm,” he said.

Mira nodded. “Comforting temperature for human buttocks: twenty-nine Celsius.”

“Moist,” he added.

“Atmospheric realism.”

Owen stared at her. “You think my couch sweats?”

Jael clacked its mandibles lightly, clearly pleased. “Ambiance acquired from human media source titled *The Apartment 2B Vlog Experience: Alone but Furnished.*""

“Fantastic,” Owen muttered. “Your designers must’ve had strokes watching HGTV.”

A hovering platform rotated toward him, a set of alien writing glowing on its face. Mira gestured.

“This is the Deck of Inquiry. We are prepared to begin our questions. But only if you are comfortable.”

Owen glanced down at the chair. It made a soft gurgle.

“I think the chair’s trying to flirt with me.”

“Then it is working. Based off of some twitter posts talking about getting off work.” Mira replied calmly.

Jael chirped in with a friendly reminder to Mira ""They changed their name to 'X' now.""

Owen leaned forward in the damp chair, elbows on knees, trying not to touch too much of anything.

“So,” he said, glancing around the gently humming chamber, “are we doing this Scientology-style or more of a 'light hypnosis with probing undertones' kind of thing?”

Mira folded her limbs neatly, kneeling without bending anything the way a human would. It was like watching a spider pretend to be polite.

“We ask questions,” she said, “and we listen. No judgment. No reward. No punishment.”

“That sounds like jury duty.”

Jael chirped softly and tapped something on its translucent clipboard. A fresh glow pulsed through the table’s surface.

“You are not under suspicion,” Mira clarified.

“Well that’s a first.”

“You are not here as a representative of Earth.”

“Better and better.”

Mira’s voice softened in tone—still inside his skull, still disembodied, but gentler. “You were selected because your thought patterns contain anomalies. A persistent darkness. A lack of synthetic optimism.”

Owen barked a humorless laugh. “So… you picked me because I’m sad?”

“Because you are honest about being sad,” Mira corrected.

He paused, caught off guard.

“That,” she added, “is increasingly rare in your species.”

Jael made a low cooing sound that Owen wasn’t sure was pity or praise. Maybe both.

“I mean,” he said, suddenly uncomfortable, “I’m not, like, *special*. I just stopped pretending things are fine.”

Mira nodded slowly. “Exactly.”

Owen narrowed his eyes. “And what, this is therapy? Alien exposure therapy? Gonna try and convince me my inner child is stardust or some crap?”

“No,” Jael said abruptly. “We want to know why you think the world is broken. And if that’s the same as it being unworthy.”

Owen looked down at the table.

That wasn’t the kind of question you could dodge with sarcasm. At least, not easily.

He took a deep breath, looked back at Mira, and said, “Start with social media.”

  
**Chapter 3: Scroll and Die**

Owen leaned back in the chair now slightly less moist, though he suspected it had merely absorbed part of his will to live and sighed.

“Social media,” he began, “is basically self-inflicted psychosis.”

Mira blinked slowly. “Elaborate.”

“You take your worst traits jealousy, boredom, self-hatred, the desperate need for validation and hook them to a feedback loop. Then you let it run twenty-four-seven, globally, and watch civilization lose its damn mind.”

Jael nodded eagerly, tapping at its clipboard. “You mean… sharing joy?”

“No. I mean comparing your breakfast to a billionaire’s yacht brunch and deciding you’re worthless.”

Mira tilted her head. “You voluntarily engage with this?”

“That’s the fun part,” Owen said, bitterly amused. “It’s addictive. Engineered to keep you scrolling. You wake up and reach for your phone before you even remember who you are.”

Jael looked puzzled. “But what are you seeking in it?”

Owen shrugged. “Some combination of news, schadenfreude, dopamine, and cat videos.”

“Doomscrolling,” Jael said, proudly.

“Yes,” Owen agreed. “Exactly.”

Jael added, “I have doomscrolled six times since your arrival.”

“You what?”

Jael tapped the clipboard again. “It plays human tragedies in a downward format. I have seen two floods, a billionaire’s apology video, and something called ‘Florida Man.’”

Owen blinked. “Yeah, okay, that’s pretty on brand.”

Mira spoke gently. “You describe it as destructive. But it began with connection, didn’t it?”

“Sure. Back when it was poking friends and posting your sandwich.”

“And now?”

“Now it’s weaponized insecurity.”

Mira gave a thoughtful hum. “Yet… you continue.”

Owen frowned, eyes flicking toward the edge of the hovering screen. “Yeah. I still check it. Even though I hate it.”

“That contradiction is very human,” Mira said, not unkindly.

Owen looked away. “Yeah. Well. We’re not exactly optimized.”

“Perhaps,” Mira said, “you are still trying to feel less alone.”

He didn’t answer right away.

Eventually, he muttered, “Well. The cat videos help.”

Jael tapped its clipboard with an audible clack. “What is… a thirst trap?”

Owen blinked.

Then blinked again.

“Oh, no,” he said. “Nope. Not doing this.”

Jael leaned forward. “But it is referenced in 39 percent of social media clusters with high interaction velocity. It appears essential.”

Owen rubbed the bridge of his nose. “It’s not *essential*, it’s just… a really specific kind of emotional bait.”

Mira looked intrigued. “Explain.”

He sighed. “Okay. A thirst trap is… when someone posts a really hot photo of themselves. Deliberately. To get attention. Usually under the guise of something innocent like, ‘Felt cute today, might delete later.’ But no one’s deleting anything. Ever.”

Jael chirped. “So… this is hydration bait?”

“No. God. It’s ‘thirst’ means desperate. In this case. Not water. It’s people fishing for validation disguised as spontaneity.”

Mira looked contemplative. “So humans display themselves as desirable to elicit digital praise.”

“Yeah,” Owen said, picking at a seam in his robe. “It’s like emotional slot machines. You post, you wait, you get likes, dopamine, validation. Rinse and repeat.”

Jael’s head rotated a little too far sideways. “Does it work?”

Owen shrugged. “Sometimes. I mean, temporarily. It makes you feel wanted for ten seconds until someone else posts better abs or a sunset with a quote about healing.”

“And yet,” Mira said, softly, “it is still an expression of hope.”

He looked up at her.

She continued: “Even if the outcome is hollow. It is the act of saying, ‘See me. Choose me. Tell me I exist.’”

Owen scoffed lightly. “You just made thirst traps sound poetic.”

“Are they not?”

He hesitated. “I mean, not usually. They’re mostly gym selfies and filtered thirst disguised as empowerment.”

“But,” Mira said, folding her too-long fingers together, “they are still trying to be seen.”

Owen let out a breath he didn’t realize he was holding.

“…Yeah,” he muttered. “Yeah, I guess they are.”

“You’re not done, are you?” Jael asked eagerly. “There are more screens. More… ecosystems?”

Owen gave him a look. “You’re disturbingly excited about humanity’s downfall.”

Jael blinked its milky eyes. “Curiosity is not doom.”

Owen leaned back in his seat still warm, still wrong and exhaled. “Alright. Let’s talk about YouTube. Twitch. The personal broadcast platforms.”

Mira gestured. “These are… art transmissions?”

Owen snorted. “Sometimes. Other times it’s a guy screaming into a microphone while playing a game about fake animatronic bears.”

Jael chirped, typing rapidly. “Live-streamed identity performance?”

“Yeah. People film themselves doing everything. Cooking, gaming, building birdhouses, reacting to trailers, watching other people build birdhouses whatever. It’s a way to connect. Or sell you soap.”

“Soap?” Jael repeated like it was a spell.

“Never mind.”

Mira tilted her head. “These transmissions… they create communities?”

“Sort of,” Owen said. “People form attachments. There’s this term ‘parasocial relationship.’ It’s where viewers feel emotionally close to the streamer, even though the streamer doesn’t know they exist.”

“Is this dishonest?” Mira asked.

Owen paused. “Not intentionally. I mean, some people lean into it, pretend they’re everyone’s best friend to sell merch. But some genuinely try to build something real. It’s just… weird. People start to feel like they *know* someone just because they watch them eat noodles at 2 a.m.”

Jael looked awed. “They subscribe to strangers.”

“Yep. Pay real money. Tip them. Cheer for them. Fight for them in comment wars.”

“This is… beautiful,” Mira said softly.

Owen squinted. “You think a guy in a Pikachu hoodie rage-donating five bucks to a streamer yelling about anime is *beautiful*?”

Mira smiled if you could call a faint glow across a wrinkled mandible a smile. “It is a symptom of longing. Your species desires intimacy. Even across screens. Even in absurdity.”

Owen scratched his chin. “I guess. I mean, sure, there’s something human in it. Or at least human-adjacent.”

He looked down at the glowing table. “It’s not all bad. Some people find their people that way. Weird people. Lonely people. People who don’t feel real until someone types their name in chat.”

He didn’t realize his voice had dropped until the silence after.

Jael clicked softly, more thoughtful now. “Do you feel real, Owen Blake?”

He looked away.

“…Depends on the day.”

# Why I don’t paywall my newsletter that includes remote job links

...and how it just landed me my first Buy Me a Coffee tip

https://preview.redd.it/tzn34xfnfy6f1.jpg?width=524&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1ece17a7978b78e9d5c8acc179be819da4c25ef

When I started on Medium nearly three months ago, I signed up for Buy Me a Coffee, mostly because it is what the platform Medium ties to their built-in tip button. But I figured, why not? If someone found my writing helpful, maybe they’d want to say thanks.

Since then, I’ve added the link to my blog and my website as well. Still, the balance stayed at $0.

Until a few days ago.

My first tip came in, and it wasn’t just a “thanks for the vibes” kind of tip. Someone landed a remote job through my newsletter and left a thank-you. It wasn’t just validation. It was proof of purpose.

And yeah, I screenshotted it immediately, as seen above.

It made me think about why I do this in the first place, and why I’ve kept everything open and accessible from day one.

I don’t paywall my writing, not on my blogs, and not in my newsletter.  
Why? Because it’s meant to help people.   
And because I will die on this hill: **no one should have to pay to look for work.**

Let’s be real. If you’re looking for work, chances are you need money. Paying just to apply, especially to some vague, overhyped role that might ghost you anyway, is broken system energy.  
We don’t play that game here.

I started *Join Me Abroad* to help people find real alternatives. I’m an expat, a writer, and someone who’s been through the mess of figuring out how to live and work outside the usual systems. The site offers visa information, personal blogs, digital downloads, and of course, my free newsletter with curated remote job leads and expat-friendly tips.

And look, I'm funny (most of the time), I give solid book recommendations, and I try not to sound like a brochure. But I know people mostly subscribe for the jobs. And honestly? That’s fine. That’s the point.

**So how do I make money?**

Good question.

Instead of charging job seekers, I make income a few other ways:

* **Employers** can pay to have their listings included (not all are paid, some I include just because they’re good).
* I use **affiliate links**, always marked, always optional.
* And I offer **professional services**, resume reviews, writing, and one-on-one planning sessions. These are paid, either through my site or via freelancer platforms like Kwork. (I just signed up, I’ll let you know if it’s worth your time later.)

This model lets me keep the helpful stuff free, without burning out or begging for crumbs.

I believe in transparency, so let me be real with you: it’s slow going.   
This isn’t one of those “I made six figures in my first month” stories.   
It’s more like, one reader at a time. One subscriber. One coffee.

And honestly? I’m grateful for every single one.

Because when you’re building something from scratch, especially something that isn’t exploiting desperation or clickbait, it takes time.  
There’s no shortcut.  
No viral growth hack.  
Just showing up, writing what matters, and hoping it lands in front of the right person on the right day.

That tip? It wasn’t just money. It was proof that someone out there found real value in what I made. That it worked. And that matters a lot more than metrics ever will.

So yes, the newsletter is free.  
But coffee isn’t.

I’ve been on Vyvanse for 8 weeks now and recently developed facial twitching—mostly around my mouth and chin. I started at 20mg for the first 3 weeks and then got bumped up to 30mg, which I’ve been on for the past 5 weeks.

At 20mg, I noticed a clearer head and better dopamine balance, but it was wearing off too early in the day, so the dose was increased. Now that I’m in school, I feel hyper-focused and very alert—locked in on the teacher and the material.

But I’ve noticed something strange: when I’m really focused, especially on people (like my teacher or classmates), I start getting involuntary facial twitches. I have a history of anxiety, especially around people due to some past trust issues. I’ve learned to manage my emotions better, but now I sometimes feel almost “emotionally frozen.” I’ll feel something inside—calm, happy, frustrated—but on the outside, I’m blank.

It’s like I’ve trained myself not to show emotion because in the past, expressing them (especially before I knew I had ADHD) often led to judgment or misunderstandings. Now, if I feel emotional during class—especially when I don’t understand something or feel frustrated—my face starts to twitch like I’m holding in a cry or an outburst. It’s like sadness and aggression are stuck trying to come out at once.

Same thing happens when I feel happy and try not to smile—my mouth twitches involuntarily. It’s honestly really frustrating and awkward. I think people around me notice, which just adds to my anxiety.

I’m going to stop drinking coffee before school to see if that helps. I wonder if I’m just overstimulated. I feel fine when I’m alone, but around people, I freeze and get anxious.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I’ve seen posts about eye twitching or scalp twitching on stimulants, but this facial stuff feels different and really disruptive.

1lbij1r,https://i.redd.it/mxrhpnpwey6f1.jpeg,Link plzz - The Bond That Lied,"“I could’ve explained everything! Why did you get rid of the child without telling me? I was his father!”
“You put him in me, remember? You made me his mother—even though he wasn’t my blood!”
My mate used a witch to implant my sister’s child into my womb.
Why? Because she didn’t want to carry it herself.
But she needed that child to solidify her title—as Luna of my first mate’s pack.
That’s right.
She stole my mate.
And now she wanted to use my body to carry her child.
So I got rid of it.
“How could you?” my sister gasped. “What will you do now, without a child?”
I smiled coldly.
“Worried about me?” I said. “You should worry about yourself...
How are you going to explain to your mate that you lost his heir?”

“You should be standing at the altar right now, not here.”

“Yeah! That’s it!” My sister Megan's breath hitched between kisses, her voice dripping with saccharine sweetness, “You're going to be late.”

“It doesn’t matter. She can wait,” came the familiar voice of my mate, just before their words were drowned by the sound of more kisses.

“Right now, you're the only thing that matters.”

“Not too deep—I don’t want to get pregnant.”

“That’s not your call.”

The next second, the unmistakable sound of fabric tearing—

While I remained standing at the altar, looking straight ahead.

It was the night of our Mating Ceremony.

I stood before the altar adorned with silverleaf flowers, clutching our engraved vow rings. My heart thudded in my chest, heavy with nerves but full of hope.

I believed that once my mate held my hand, our destinies would forever intertwine under the Moon Goddess’s witness.

But the next moment, a Beta rushed over, his expression grim as he whispered something to the pack elder.

A hush swept over the crowd. Uneasy murmurs followed.

I turned toward the resting chambers, a knot of dread tightening in my chest—

Until a warrior opened the door leading there. And in that moment, my entire world shattered.

There stood my mate, bare-chested, and in his arms—

Was my sister, Megan, the one I had nurtured, protected, and trusted with everything.

She looked straight at me, her lips curled into a triumphant smirk.

The crowd erupted—not in cheers, but in cruel laughter.

Blessings turned into whispers. Whispers into sneers. Sneers into open mockery.

I stood frozen, and the ring slipped from my fingers, hitting the ground with a crisp clink—like the sharp echo of a heart breaking.

“Lauren, what’s done is done. Just let him go—to your sister,” my mother urged softly at my side.

My mind went blank.

Tears streamed down, but I couldn’t even feel them.

My parents murmured gently, trying to soothe me, as if that would ease the betrayal.

“I now declare that the bride tonight... is Megan, not Lauren.”

“Enough.”

A low voice cut through the chaos.

The crowd fell silent and parted instinctively.

Landon, Alpha of the neighboring Seafall Pack, stepped forward in a sleek black suit. His face was cold as stone, but his eyes burned with fury.

He was mysterious, rarely seen in public.

He stopped in front of me, dropped to one knee without hesitation, and reached out a hand:

“Be my Luna. I’ll show everyone that you are the only one worthy of honor.”

I glared at my mate and my sister, then turned to Landon—and placed my hand in his without a second thought.

What should have been a mating ceremony with my fated mate, became the moment I was claimed by a different Alpha.

After we sealed the mate bond, he treated me with the utmost tenderness.

But despite our efforts, we were never able to have a pup of our own.

One day, in the gentlest voice, he said... maybe I was the reason we couldn't have a child.

Desperate, we sought the help of a witch.

Her potion worked—and for the first time, I was expecting a child.

From then on, Landon treated me with even greater care and devotion.

I believed—truly—that he was my home. My fate.

Until the day I overheard his conversation with a friend.

“Landon, that was cruel. Luna Lauren’s been nothing but good to you—

How could you have the witch transfer Megan’s child into Lauren’s womb just because Megan didn’t want to go through labor? You turned her into a breeder.”

“And the child's due in two months. What then?”

He was silent for a moment. Then sighed.

“Once the child is born, I’ll give it to Megan. It’s what she’s always wanted.”

“And Lauren?”

“As for Lauren, I’ll tell her the child didn’t make it.”

“Of course. I’ll stay by her side for the rest of her life.”

So that was it.

His gentleness, his care—

All for her.

“Aren’t you afraid Lauren will find out?”

After a pause, Landon replied,

“She won’t.”

“You really believe that?”

“She trusts me,” he said, voice steady.

“If I say it’s true, she won’t doubt me. She never does.”

There was a silence. Then his friend lowered his voice:

“Just don’t regret it.”

Landon gave a faint laugh. “I won’t.”

I stood outside the door, my fingers digging into my palms. There was no pain. I’d gone numb.

I had only come to bring him afternoon tea.

Now, all I felt was a gaping hole in my chest, as if something had been viciously torn away.

The cold wind pierced through me.

I stumbled back to the pack house and didn’t even bother turning on the lights.

Collapsed onto the sofa, I shivered uncontrollably.

Tears slipped silently down my cheeks—too drained to even wipe them.

Then I heard the door click open.

He was home.

Chapter 2

The sound of shoes on the floor grew closer.

He walked up to the couch and bent down slightly, his voice gentle and tinged with concern.

“Why didn’t you turn on the lights? The maid said you didn’t eat... Is your stomach bothering you again?”

He reached out, gently brushing aside the hair on my forehead. His brows furrowed in genuine concern.

“Lauren, what’s wrong?”

He knelt down, his palm covering the back of my hand as he spoke softly,

“You have to eat—it's not good for the child.”

I stared at him. At his tender, considerate expression.

So... love could be acted out after all.

Four years ago, at my Mating Ceremony, it was Landon who stepped forward and made me his Luna.

Back then, I thought he was the one who had pulled me out of my nightmare.

After becoming his Luna, I supported him, helped him strengthen his pack, year after year.

This year, with the help of a witch, we finally conceived a child.

Everything was perfect.

He held me in his arms, saying this child was the gift he had longed for. His smile was gentle, and his eyes so warm they almost melted me.

But it turns out... it was all just another carefully crafted lie.

If he could act—

Why couldn’t I?

I blinked slowly and curved my lips into a faint smile.

“I’m fine. Just a little tired.”

My voice was soft, tinged with fatigue—nothing unusual.

He sighed in relief, coaxing gently,

“Alright. Get some rest early.”

Fine.

Then let’s keep acting for another three days.

In three days, this performance will end.

The next morning, Landon accompanied me to a prenatal checkup.

He was attentive the whole time, asking the doctor countless questions.

The pack doctor chuckled, “Alpha really dotes on Luna.”

He held my hand, his gaze gentle.

“This is a child we’ve waited so long for. Of course I’m going to take good care of both of you.”

As we stepped out of the exam room, we bumped into Megan.

She wore a loose dress. The moment she saw us, a flash of pride flickered in her eyes.

I looked at her belly—conspicuously padded—and sneered.

No wonder she’d said it was “such a coincidence” that we were expecting a child at the same time. She’d been waiting for this moment all along.

She walked over, smiling brightly.

“Lauren, when’s your due date?”

As she spoke, her hand reached toward my belly.

I gave her a cold look—and slapped her hand away.

“What are you doing?” Megan’s expression darkened instantly, A flicker of anger flashed in her eyes.

She opened her mouth to retort—but I lowered my head and pressed a hand to my stomach, voice weak,

“My stomach... it hurts a little...”

She stopped mid-sentence. That smugness on her face disappeared immediately.

Landon supported me at once, concern in his voice,

“Was the checkup too long? Do you want to go back and rest?”

He sounded so worried, but I saw it clearly—

His gaze was on Megan the whole time, silently trying to soothe her.

I lowered my lashes and murmured,

“I’m going to the restroom.”

He frowned, wanting to follow.

I waved a hand. “No need. Just wait for me here.”

He hesitated, then finally nodded.

“Be careful.”

I turned into the restroom.

But the moment the door closed—I saw him hurrying off. Just as I expected.

He’d gone to comfort Megan.

Quietly, I followed. I stood at a distance and watched him coaxing her, his voice low and soft.

Megan pouted, narrowing her eyes in suspicion.

“Do you have feelings for her? She embarrassed me just now and you didn’t even defend me. Are you still holding on to her?”

Landon sighed helplessly.

“I’m just thinking of the child. After all, she’s—”

He didn’t finish.

Instead, he reached into his pocket and took out a delicate jewelry box.

Opening it, he pulled out a brand-new bracelet and gently placed it on her wrist.

“The bracelet you wanted last time—I got it for you.”

Megan’s mood visibly improved. She smiled coyly,

“The stock you recommended last time made me a ton of money. Got anything new for me?”

I stood there watching the scene, suddenly finding it all absurd.

Landon—using everything that once belonged to me to please her.

I turned and walked away.

Pulled out my phone. Dialed a number.

“Hello. Just confirming the time of the procedure.”

“Yes, everything will be ready tomorrow.”

Behind me, familiar footsteps suddenly stopped.

“Tomorrow?” Landon’s voice held a trace of confusion.

“Where are you going?”

I turned around, meeting his gaze with a faint smile.

“I booked a maternity photo shoot. I want to take a family portrait... something to remember this by.”

Chapter 3

His expression shifted slightly, a flicker of hesitation passing through his eyes.

I arched my brows deliberately, my tone light and casual.

“What’s wrong? Don’t you want to come with me?”

He opened his mouth but avoided my gaze.

“No, it’s not that... I just worry it’ll tire you out. And I’ve got a pack meeting tomorrow—how about another day?”

I looked at him and let out a soft laugh, my voice warm and considerate.

“Of course. Pack business comes first. I’ll go on my own.”

He seemed relieved, smiling as he reached out to lightly ruffle my hair with practiced affection.

“You’re always so thoughtful. What would I do without you?”

The morning of the procedure, just before leaving the house, Landon suddenly took out a small bracelet and gently put it on my wrist.

“This is for you,” he said with his usual gentle tone and soft gaze.

I looked down—it was the matching bracelet to the one he gave Megan. A freebie.

My fingers clenched slightly. I looked up at him and smiled softly.

“Thank you. It’s lovely.”

He smiled too, ruffling my hair again as he murmured,

“Lauren, you’re always so good to me.”

Before heading to the hospital for the procedure, I decided to stop by my parents’ house.

But before I even reached the door, I heard voices drifting out clearly.

Megan’s spoiled, complaining tone:

“What’s so special about Lauren? She hit me yesterday!”

My mother’s gentle voice trying to soothe her:

“Just be patient a little longer. Didn’t we already help you take her fiancé? This time will work too. Don’t rush.”

My father sighed heavily.

“Enough. You’ve already become the Luna of Lauren’s first mate. If your mate’s Alpha parents ever find out how this child really came to be, there’ll be a lot to pay—for all of us.”

Landon’s voice chimed in, soft but steady:

“Megan, don’t worry. I brought the prenatal report from yesterday—it’s all good. We just need to wait now.”

He paused, then added,

“Ryan, Amanda, please don’t worry. I’ve got this. For Megan, I’ll do anything.”

My fingertips went ice-cold.

It felt like all the blood in my body had stopped flowing.

So... they all knew.

All this time... they’d been in it together. I was nothing more than a pawn.

A maid knocked to deliver coffee.

Landon opened the door casually—then froze.

Lying quietly at the threshold was the broken bracelet he had just given me that morning.

His expression changed instantly.

He gasped, eyes darting in panic as he bolted to the door and looked around frantically.

Then came the calls. Over and over.

When I finally picked up, his voice was trembling with anxiety.

“Lauren, where are you? I can explain—just listen, okay?”

I kept silence.

His voice grew increasingly frantic.

“Lauren! Please— Where are you?!”

Then, over the phone, a nurse’s voice came through clearly in the background:

“Lauren Whitman? Please sign here before the procedure.”

On the other end, Landon sounded like he had been punched in the gut.

He choked, then exploded into hysteria.

“Procedure? Where are you?! What are you talking about?!”

He was screaming now, voice completely unraveling.

I stared at the screen for a moment, then gently swiped my finger.

Call ended.

My symptoms began suddenly on February 11, starting with a strong sensation like I was about to faint (but never did), a feeling like you’re boat sick. Dr suspected vestibular neuritis and sent me to physio. It helped with balance, I’m back to cycling, and using the screens, but the rest is still a nightmare. 

Had chest scan, holter monitor, eye checks, nothing abnormal. Same with blood tests, all perfect. Just had an MRI which also found nothing, except a bit of an inflamed sinus (but this is not new). 

After the first intense phase, I had about two weeks of improvement.

Then the dizziness and nausea returned, often fluctuating unpredictably. I began experiencing panic attacks and fear of fainting, especially during triggering activities like driving, being in busy environments. I’m afraid to leave the house now, as it hits at any time and my legs feel jelly and I feel like I’m drunk. It scares me so much and breathing doesn’t help, I feel it’s more physical and panic attacks are just the aftermath. 

I am waiting for a neurologist, but it is a 12+ months wait. 

Is there anything I can do in terms of medication to settle this down? 

What else can I do expect VRT, CBT, and excluding coffee, sleeping well? 

What is wrong with me? 😭

I don’t want to loose my job or feel like this forever. Dr suspects it’s now a vestibular migraine as it presents itself similar and I have a history of migraines from when I was younger.

I don't know what you class as a friend but in the mind of someone under 16, there are 3 types of friend.

A fake/dare/using you friend.

A real friend who you play/hang out with.

Someone who you talk to.

I can not empathise with how many times I encountered fake friends. I met a person, for obvious reasons, who will be referred to as Tom in this post. I met him when I moved schools. He was a good guy. We hung out, played, honestly, anything you do with a normal friend.

Fast forward 1.5 years. He finds out I have awesome skills. Skills that people pay for people to accomplish. Suddenly, in his fictional coffee shop ""business,"" I become marketing, advertising, and design lead. As you can guess, I'm forced to make high-quality ads for him, etc. Not only that, but he established ""gangs"" where you had to do stupid tests, which I would not dare to do. Honestly, I was, and still am, a respected student in education who will not do that. The problem in the ""gangs"" is the hierarchy. If a person they didn't like joined, they would immediately establish a poll to kick him out.

Back to venting about of being lonely.

I am trying to meet friends on videogames, primarily Roblox (for those who don't know it's a game with millions of games, including WtB, Brookhaven, Dead Rails, ARSENA,L and more)

I met a girl, once again, I'll refer to her as another name. In this case, Angela. We played and became good friends. Suddenly, she unfriended me. I friended her back, and she said Oh sorry, it was a mistake. Internally, I knew she didn't like me. At this point, I'm used to everyone hating me. We don't even play, we just text. And today, she unfriended me once again. I know it's on purpose. And I don't know, I'm lonely. Most people  have friended I don't even talk to, or I meant to unfriend. Its just like the world doesn't want me to have friends, be a child, have fun, grow up.

BUT. There is only one good thing. I can focus on my studies, prepare for my future. I bet that no eleven year-old s doing a course by  Google in UX, creating savings accounts, budgeting, designing or even studying at all.

I've been learning English for a long time, but my level didn’t really improve until I started working at a company headquartered in the USA. There are also some people in the Kraków office who speak only English, so I’ve had more chances to use it.

I have weekly online lessons with a tutor from the US, where I can practice my English skills, but I feel it’s not enough, especially when it comes to casual, everyday conversations. I still struggle a bit with small talk and informal chatting.

That’s why I’d love to find someone in Kraków (preferably another woman) who speaks English fluently or is a native speaker, and who’d be up for meeting from time to time (for coffee, a walk, food, or board games) and just chatting in English only (no Polish!). I think it’s often easier to connect and find common topics woman-to-woman 😊 But I’m open-minded either way!

In exchange, I’d be happy to offer Polish conversation. I'm a native speaker (but definitely not a language expert 😄), so I can help you speak more naturally and explain things when I can, but I don’t go deep into grammar rules. Just relaxed, real-life Polish.

A bit about me: I'm a 27-year-old woman, married, and I have a small, friendly dog who loves people. I enjoy going to the gym (but I’m not a gym rat), running (not marathons though 😅), and reading good books. I'm into deep conversations about life, psychology, TV series, and more. Also, I’m a big fan of board games. I have a lot of great ones at home and know some great spots to play in Kraków.

I normally don't even get stoned i just enjoy smoking. I dont like to be gluttonous in this area as I do feel thar is a sin. If consuming wine and strong drink is okay and it impairs me more than marijuana, would it be a sin to partake or is cultural Christianity in America just labeling it a sin? Other countries it's normal to enjoy a spliff etc and looked at like a coffee. One verse I had for this was
Deuteronomy 14:26 KJV
[26] and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 
I know this is referring to celebrations, feast, and wine. If the israelites and Jesus consumed wine are recreational substances a sin in moderation? Alcohol seems far more destructive in my eyes even in small amounts. (I do drink a few times a month or week, but it's not preferance)",8,1749932767.0,Christianity,35,0.83,False

He had been in and out of the hospital the last few months and was failing at home. He recently bought a condo and is constantly asking to go back to live independently in his condo. We continue to explain to him that he needs the help (no longer able to cook, make coffee, use a microwave, pay bills, has been scammed multiple times, organize grocery delivery, has had multiple falls, doesn't take meds properly, etc etc). We are terrified to leave him home alone as he does not thrive and once was on the floor 16 hours.I feel so bad as he truly wants nothing more but to live on his own but we had hired help and he would refuse to even let them in the condo. He refused to go into care home but we eventually convinced him that doctors would not release him home from hospital unless it was to care home. He is constantly complaining he hates care home (mostly he hates not being in his condo) and asking to see Dr to get 'signed off' out of care home. He is in an excellent care home. He just does not understand he is not safe to live on his own despite every explanation I give him he feels he is fine. This is so hard on my heart and I am constantly feeling guilty.

I’ve lived in Toronto for just over 3 years now and have struggled to make/maintain friendships, I’m currently unemployed and an online student so making friends organically isn’t easy!

I’m into reading, playing video games (casual cozy gamer mostly), movies, I’ve been learning to crochet for years but never finished a project but it’s on my long list of potential hobbies, I love coffee, going for drinks, grabbing food, shopping/thrifting, and obsessing over my cat lol. I’m very much a homebody, prefer more casual hangouts to night life but I’m not against a night out occasionally!

I have ADHD and autism so high maintenance friendships can be troublesome for me, I need someone to understand my awkwardness but I think I’m a pretty good vibe matcher! If you’re looking for a hype girl I’m your girl! I’m also plus size, very socially liberal, queer, and accepting!!

I am in need of a little help with a situation with my wife. We recently got married (little over a year) and we are running into some financial bumps that I'd like to get a second/third opinion on. Thank you in advance. 

My wife used to work before we got married, but recently stopped not by choice but because we relocated. Prior to getting married, we agreed that I will be paying for everything personal as well as our daily needs (insurance, groceries, gas, utilities, etc). This is how it should be in a Muslim household anyways. In addition to that, I proposed to provide my credit card for her personal shopping as long as it is reasonable - needs versus wants. This has worked even though it was beyond reasonable sometimes with unnecessary purchases. Amazon cart always has something and never said no. Always going out, always coffee, always pastries, always cakes. You name it.

Right now, she is demanding a monthly allowance in addition to credit card usage. Lots of comparison to others like this one her husband does this, and thag one her husband gives, etc. She called me ""cheap"" which i find very disrespectful. She lives a very comfortable life with so much in hand that others don't have. 

She wanted to see her family after Eid vacationing while i am still working. We live overseas, so a hefty plane ticket plus all the spending on the card which I expected. I am also anticipating that some of the spending is going to others (her family) using our money and demanding cash claiming for places/things where a credit card won't work.  When talking to her about this, she claims that I am not supportive, dismisses everything, I don't understand, starts crying, doesn't listen, interrupts, the list goes on.

I just need some sense of what this looks like from a different lense. What would you do?

*The Envied was a HORRIBLE person.*

*That much was certain.*

*The Envious was always many things, reincarnated time and time again. Timid, loud, sad, angry, and many other things.*

*But the Envied was always one thing, most of the time.*

*A horrible. Horrible person.*

*But...*

*Who would have it in their hearts to kill a fellow lord? In their domain, nonetheless?*

*The Envious, tired of being mistreated?*

*A lowly imp, trying to get payback for a wrong commited under them?*

*Or, maybe...*

Limbo: Gluttony?

**Months ago, before Limbo died.**

*He was knocking on the door.*

Gluttony: I'm up. I'm up.

*Gluttony opens it, holding a cup of coffee.*

Limbo: You haven't done your duties in a while, haven't you?

*Gluttony was one of the younger sins. Most of his time recently was renovating the castle the previous Gluttony had left beind.*

Gluttony: What did I have to do again?

Limbo: Paperwork, mostly. We need to renegotiate contracts with Lust for construction workers for your bridge to the living world-

Gluttony: Why do I have to negotiate with Lust again?

Limbo: The imp construction forces are focused on Wrath's layer now, while we figure out how to undo the holy seal on him.

Gluttony: He's been stuck as a penguin for 100 years, its not like you'll find it no-

Limbo: He's also been living in the living world for 2 years now, if you recall.

Gluttony: Yup. tha-that'll do it.

*Gluttony walks with Limbo, through a...complex of sorts.*

*In Hell, there are two ways to travel between layers: The Old Roads, and the Gateways.*

*The gateways are...a hub of sorts, for the layers. A circle of doors.*

*When there were only 1 or two layers, these weren't needed, but now there were, in total, 8, excluding Sloth, there was a much greater need for it.*

*And, as Gluttony passed by the doors, he saw it.*

*The door to Envy.*

*Wincing as he passed.*

*He heard the stories of how...frankly, horrible Envy's layer was.*

*And, he never wanted to go there.*

*Until Limbo turned around after passing Envy's door.*

Limbo: Here we are.

Gluttony: A-are we going...in there?

Limbo: Yes, Mr. Gluttony.

*Gluttony opens the door, walking inside.*

*Walking out to an emerald city.*

1lbi301,https://deadline.com/2025/06/little-amelie-review-awards-buzz-annecy-festival-1236434168/,‘Little Amelie’ Review: Awards Buzz Awaits This Delightfully Dark Meditation On Life And Death From A Child’s Perspective – Annecy Festival,">You could be forgiven for thinking *Little Amélie* is some sort of prequel to Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s delightfully French 2001 fantasy *Amélie*. Instead, this animated feature from Maïlys Vallade and Liane-Cho Han is delightfully French in a different kind of way, perfect for sensitive adults and sophisticated children who dream of wearing rollnecks, shades and berets and sipping black coffee in tiny cups at Les Deux Magots while arguing with each other about whether or not Miles Davis went downhill after splitting up with Juliette Greco. Philosophically, it was one of *les plus françoises* films in the selection in [Cannes](https://deadline.com/tag/cannes/) this year, and that means a lot when the main competition is Richard Linklater’s *Nouvelle Vague*, which practically arrived on a bicycle, festooned with onions.

>On closer inspection, however, *Little Amélie* is a lot more nuanced than that, a fascinating multicultural mélange that’s rooted in two very different cultures, one almost entirely unseen. The subject is life and death, and it must surely be based on a *very* personal memoir by Amélie Nothomb, a writer from Belgium. That country also gave us Jacques Brel, and — much like that famously self-mythologising, existentialist balladeer — our heroine, Amélie, takes charge of her story right from her inception, recalling her curious birth and arrested infanthood, in which she was written off from the outset (“Your child is a vegetable,” a doctor tells her parents, as she watches impassively). Amélie’s mother and father, a musician and a diplomat, welcome her regardless, and she shares the family home with her much more boisterous brother and sister.

>The setting shifts to Japan, and on a very specific date — 13 August 1969 — a minor earthquake causes Amélie to wake up from her locked-in state (“What happened that day remains a mystery,” she notes in voiceover). This miraculous awakening coincides with a visit from her twinkly eyed and rather boozy grandma, who introduces her to the delights of Belgian confectionery and gives her the rock-star attention she’s been craving. The little girl describes these events as tantamount to a rebirth: “I was born at the age of two-and-a-half in the Kansai mountains by the grace of white chocolate.”

>The rest of the film stays with Amélie in the run-up to her third birthday, as she befriends the family nanny, Nishio-san, who introduces the little girl to various aspects of Japanese folklore, from its monsters to its rituals. In a most extraordinary piece of animation, Nishio-san even reflects on her harrowing experiences of the Second World War. *Little Amélie* is brutal in that respect, and the little girl’s fragility leads to a brace of uncompromising near-death experiences, both of which we see almost from a remove, as if Amélie is leaving her body, or perhaps remembering something she’s been told.

>Add to that the fact that Amélie isn’t a particularly likeable child and you have an animation that fits right into the current awards cycle, where traditional big-budget studio animations are being rejected in favor of more bespoke, hand-made tales like last year’s winner *Flow*. It’s easy on the eye, like an Eric Rohmer film painted in pastel watercolors on blotting paper, but it cuts just as deep, revisiting deep Japanese wounds while also thinking on grief as a universal matter, using Amélie’s very astute observation that toddlers instinctively know everything and nothing when it comes to death.

>*Little Amélie* leaves a lot open for interpretation and only explains the very strange beginning right at the end, which might be a test for less patient viewers. In that respect, it’s unlike anything else on the market right now, and serves as a reminder of how much better animation can be when it comes to handling the abstractions in our everyday lives.",12,1749932381.0,oscarrace,0,1.0,False

Okay so I’ve worked remotely for the past 4 years. I’m lucky — I’ve got a solid group of 5 friends I can meet up with, and I meet people through them. But **I miss meeting people through work.**

Sure, I work with teammates — but we never meet in real life. Even when work pays for travel, no one shows up to socials. They’re just not interested. And that’s fine. But it leaves me feeling like:

“I work alone… but do I have to?”

**So heres the idea:**

**A virtual, proximity-based office for remote workers.**

Imagine having *coworkers* (or some better name — ideas welcome!) who aren’t at your company, but are nearby.

It’s like a *live, casual LinkedIn* — no professionalism bullshit — where you can:

* Share live updates (pics of your cat, your coffee, your desk — whatever)
* Create open lunch dates / after-work drinks
* Join random group quizzes / chats
* Just feel like you’re working *with* others
* Integrations (later) — Slack, Teams, Google Calendar sync

The key insight: they don’t need to be at your company — just *in your area*.

# I’d love your input!

* Would you use something like this?
* Is this a pain you feel too?
* What would you add (or remove) to make it better?

There's a lot of things that are open to interpretation and are 'gray areas'. Coffee is not one of them.

Showing off your new coffee maker in your Discord and then telling someone that yes, you ARE a ""coffee enthusiast"" when said machine will be brewing pods is an utter and complete joke.

Nobody. And I mean unequivocally absolutely not one person that likes, respects and understands coffee uses pods. Ever. You want coffee that tastes and smells like cat piss? Use a pod. You want coffee that is flavored like maple walnut blueberry taffy birthday cake? Use a pod. You want coffee that tastes like coffee and respects the plant and what it produces? Buy beans and grind them. At the very least (small gag) buy pre-ground. 

But FFS pods? Yeah, I know you've been using them for a while, but to invest in a new machine for that is just gross. If you had a man card to take away it would be gone now. Go get the other Ninja that actually brews real coffee, not single serve hot brown gutter swill.

I bought a London Underground Zone 1-6 to Heathrow Rail ticket for around £11 (with my railcard). I took the Victoria line to Oxford Circus, had a quick coffee break, and then boarded the Elizabeth line train to Heathrow at Bond Street. This was the plan shown by the Trainline app. However, the gates didn’t open. The staff said my ticket was already used and I needed to buy a new one, but they wouldn’t do anything. I explained that it was a break in my journey, not a completed travel. I had to tap in with my phone at the end because I didn’t have the mind to read the ticket conditions while I was held at the gate. Later I checked the Trainline app regarding the conditions in my ticket, and it mentioned that I could always break the journey to change trains. How on earth am I supposed to switch trains at Bond Street without exiting at Oxford Circus tube station? Has anyone else faced this issue? ",0,1749931992.0,uktravel,18,0.14,False

We're visiting next week, but I will really only be there for about 48 hours. In that time, I really want to try to get a ""feel"" for the area and maybe see which town would be a good fit for us. We're in our late 20s, no kids. We love board games, comedy, trivia, and other indoor activities. I also love nature, but not really into hiking or biking (yet!). I like to get out and meet others, but we aren't really drinkers and not really seeking the college vibes of Fayetteville. I'm wondering if Bentonville or Rogers would be a good fit for us. Can you recommend any must-visit areas, coffee shops, or restaurants for our very short visit? ",0,1749931914.0,northwestarkansas,16,0.5,False
