I’m a Cadet Pilot. For the last year, I tried to force the iPad Pro to be my ""Flight Bag."" I had the perfect setup (M1 Pro + Pencil + Keyboard), but I realized my retention was dropping.

I dug into the psychology of why (Metacognitive Illusion, Attention Residue) and realized I needed to ditch the LCD screen for something with ""Friction.""

I wanted to share this ""unpopular opinion"" with other students here. Sometimes the hardware is perfect, but the *psychology* of the screen fights against you.

**The Great Unlearning**

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad magic keyboard (ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case).

After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting.

My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation. A mountain of dense, merciless theory. Aerodynamics, engines, electrical systems, all crammed into thousands of pages. And in aviation, almost knowing is the same as not knowing. You can’t “guess” how an aircraft system works at 35,000 feet. 

And here’s the terrifying part: the knowledge wasn’t sticking. 

On the iPad, everything felt neat, but hollow. I could read for hours, scroll through PDFs, highlight in neon colors… and yet, the next morning, it was as if I’d done nothing. The learning slid off my brain like water on glass. 

It was the strangest, most unsettling feeling. I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because the very tool I had trusted was betraying me. 

I was heading toward what I now call a cognitive nosedive: all systems looking functional, but the aircraft (my brain) losing altitude fast. 

That’s when I snapped. 

I did something absurd. 

I took my thousand-page PDFs, walked into a print shop, and said: “Print it all.” 

# The Homecoming

The printer groaned and clattered, spitting out stack after stack of warm A4 paper. The shopkeeper looked at me like I was insane. Honestly? I felt insane.. Here I was, the proud owner of a futuristic $1000 iPad, paying extra money to drag myself backwards into the past. 

But then I picked up the first heavy stack. I opened the first page. I pulled out a simple ballpoint pen. And I underlined. 

# The Uncomfortable Truth

I eventually passed my exams, but I realized the iPad was a ""Distraction Engine"" that was fracturing my focus. I needed something in between the ""dumbness"" of paper and the ""distraction"" of an LED screen.

I wrote a full breakdown of the psychology behind this (Metacognitive Illusion) and why I'm switching to E-Ink for my next phase of training.

My bestfriend- we will call him Eddie-  is a pastry chef. I have other very flexible job as well. It's not like I need to go to the bakery but I like to go there and help my bestfriend and most of the time we carpool cause we are neighbours too. 

Right so there's this girl, let's call them Amy, they come in with two if their friends almost every day and will sit in one of the table for hours ordering some cake or pastries or cookies and coffee. They will be all giggly and blushing whenever Eddie would walk out the kitchen to the front area. 

As I said Eddie is a pastry chef so most of the time he is in the kitchen while I am by the counter. After my shift I usually sit in one of the table and work until its time to close so I am there for 3-4 hours if not less and while I am there, Eddie would come out of the kitchen to check on me. He would sometimes bring us some cake and coffee whenever he is on break, we would talk for a while and then he would go back to work. 

Last Monday, I overheard Amy asking one of staff members about me and Eddie. She asked ""OP and the chef look very close to each other no?"" The staff member said "" Yeah"" and went back to work. I didn't mind anything back then. But two days later, Amy, came up to me when I was waiting for my bestfriend to finish his work and close the bakery. She started making small talks. (I HATE SMALL TALKS) After a few minutes she asked me if I had a boyfriend. I said no. Then she asked if the chef has a gf. I again said no. And before I could say something else she stood up and said 'oh nice' and went back to her friends. 

The following Friday, Eddie and I were sitting and talking about the shits we need to get done for Christmas when Amy walked up to us and sat down on the spare chair and started going on and on about how much she liked Eddie and then she asked him for a date. And Eddie and I just sat there. 

Coffee in our hands. Fork halfway to the pastry. Eddie looks at me. I look at him. Amy looks at Eddie. I blink. He blinks.

Then he says ""No. I can't. Thankyou for asking but I can't."" 

Amy blinks. Once. Twice. 

She turns to me ""You said he was single? You liar. You said you are not dating. You fucking bitch.""

I was taken aback at this and took a second to realise wtf was happening so I said ""You asked me if he had a gf. I said no. You didn't even give a chance to say more than that. You didn't ask if he was married or not?""


She then threw in some very colourful words and stormed out and now she is banned from the bakery. ",1,1765196383.0,u_gone_girl20,0,1.0,False
1phax2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindEvolution/comments/1phax2v/you_will_be_okay/,You will be okay.,"You can’t escape the character, but your relationship with your character can be changed. When I say “character,” I mean your body, thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, triggers, habits.. all of that.

Guys, look. It’s like playing a Mario video game. You’re not the Mario character, but when Mario eats those mushrooms 🍄, it affects him — he gets bigger. And when bullets hit him, he gets smaller or whatever. But the player who’s controlling Mario (your higher self) is untouched.

Let me make one thing clear.. your higher self isn’t a person or a thing. It’s not something you can point to because it’s not made of anything. It’s outside the game. Outside the matrix. But you as a character can’t escape the matrix because there’s nothing outside the game, but you’re already free from the matrix because you’re not the character.

Anyway, there is cause and effect here. If you eat a lot, your stomach won’t feel good. If you’re rude or bad to people, they won’t like you. Even though the player can’t be affected by any story, the character does get affected. So it’s your job to make your character happy, peaceful, wise, and healthy.

I know lots of things aren’t in your control. Like  your genes, your relationships, the environment around you. So many conditions shape your happiness and well-being. It’s impossible to smile and be happy when you stub your toe or when something bad happens.

But the good news is (even though it’s not really “good news,” it’s just the law of the universe)..nothing lasts forever or stays the same. Pain goes away. Trauma heals or becomes less triggering with time. You will be okay. Even when you’re not okay, your higher self is okay and completely unbothered.

I know some of you will say this is nonsense spiritual talk. Guys, I’m not ignoring your suffering. I’m telling you to look at it from a different angle. It's like to change your relationship with it.

Like Buddha once said, you can’t avoid the first arrow, but you can avoid the second one...the resistance to what’s already happening. It’s like when your favorite coffee mug breaks because your cat knocked it over. You can’t change that. It’s already broken. But you can stop suffering by not clinging to what’s already gone, and stop being mad at your cat. Accept that it’s broken and move on.

And I know sometimes you feel like “nothing lasts forever, so what’s the point?” Let life drive the car for a while and just watch the show. It’s like knowing chess is just a made-up game and it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. But getting too detached from life isn’t good for your character. You still have to live, create, and have fun. You can take the steering wheel too, drive the car of your life in a direction that makes your character happy, peaceful, and wise.

It’s like there’s zero (pure awareness) and there’s the world (duality — the plus and minus). You stay close to zero when the world gets too loud, and then you go back into the world to play and create when you feel bored. Zero is flavorless — super peaceful but nothing’s happening. The world is colorful and bright, but it also gets chaotic and intense if you immerse yourself too much in it.

And it’s like chocolate...it’s not good or bad. Eating too much chocolate will make you sick, but that doesn’t mean you have to get rid of chocolate. Just be smart and don’t eat too much. Life is like that. Don’t get lost in duality. Have fun, guys. And trust in God, trust in the universe, and love yourself.

I'm raised in a university where academic high-stakes culture is normal. I didn't even choose to be here. It's especially harder when you're someone who doesn't have the will to live nor to die. You're in the middle — trying to survive. I used to have depression, and I definitely think my history with depression is playing a huge role. Everyone thinks of me as one of the smart, reliable students throughout elementary, middle school, highschool and even during senior highschool, but no I'm not — I study and that's it to it. I can't say I'm academically smart, I'm just surviving. I am not even allowed to pursue what I truly want such as politcs, business, literature. Not to mention I hate studying things I have no passion for and it's painful to force yourself into doing things you genuinely don't desire to do. 

And I if do one day eventually do fuck it all and just follow my passion or rather, ""irrationality"", I lose my friends, my parent's affection, my overall stability. People here look down on students who aren't academically smart. and I hate being looked down on which isn't helping in my predicament. On top of that, no matter how i remind myself I am more than my academic standing, it doesn't work. I'm raised that way and I hate it. I especially dislike it when I'm not even able to express this worry towards my closest friends. What if they look down on me? or avoid me? or no longer think of me as their friend? I'm actually miserable but constantly trying to prove my worth keeps me going (I wouldn't recommend it because it's genuinely wrecking me.) Additionally, I hate HATE or rather, LOATHE being called a pessimist. I'm actually crashing out now — because the said people isn't even aware of what I HAD TO GO THROUGH TO JUST SURVIVE THIS FAR. I used to be an optimist. but no. not anymore — and I wish i could go back, and I'm trying. oh and great, just earlier, my coffee just stained my clothes and my written reviewer. at this point i dont even have the energy to be mad.

I added spoiler just incase.

A friend recently told me I should only use cold water in a kettle, especially for drinking, which sent me down a small research rabbit hole. The logic behind it seems to be:

• hot water sits longer in pipes and the water heater,
• that longer contact can dissolve metals (lead/copper) or pick up sediment,
• warm lines are more friendly to bacteria than cold lines,
• and boiling later doesn’t remove heavy metals.

At the same time, a lot of tea/coffee folks say cold water tastes cleaner and gives more predictable results, since fresh cold water contains more dissolved oxygen.

So now I'm questioning the habit I’ve had for a decade. 

For anyone who knows more about appliances or plumbing:

  Do you personally avoid filling the kettle with hot tap water?
  Is this a legit concern, or mostly theoretical?
  In newer houses with updated plumbing/heaters, is this still an issue?
  Could starting with hot water affect kettle lifespan or scaling?

I’m not panicking, just curious if this is one of those “better safe than sorry” situations or if I’ve been overthinking a tiny time-saving habit.

I’m building Moments, a hybrid marketplace where people can book micro lifestyle experiences instead of long, expensive events.

Examples:
•Ride shotgun in a BMW M2 for 20 minutes
•Sunset coffee on a villa balcony
•Short pillion ride on a superbike
•One-hour aesthetic rooftop session
•Mini photoshoots
•Emotional, small, memorable moments

Why?
People want small indulgences, not day-long commitments.
Gen Z lives for moments, not things.

Supply comes from everyday people with cool assets.
Demand comes from anyone who wants a short, unique experience.

If this sounds interesting:
•Roast the idea
•Improve it
•Or if you’re an investor, DM me. I’m opening early discussions

1phafow,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteApartments/comments/1phafow/safe_areas_to_live_in_charlotte_nc/,"Safe Areas To Live in Charlotte, NC?","**Moving to Charlotte? Here Are the Most Popular Areas Locals Tend to Choose**

Hey y’all — I see a ton of posts asking where the “best” areas to live are in Charlotte, so I wanted to put together a quick breakdown based on what most people moving here end up gravitating toward.

Charlotte has a lot of neighborhoods with totally different vibes, so here’s a rundown of the ones people consistently talk about, tour, and ultimately move into:

# South End

If you want walkability, breweries, the light rail, modern apartments, and a social lifestyle, this is *the* hotspot. Tons of new construction, food options, and easy access to Uptown. Great for anyone who loves being in the middle of everything.

  
**Dilworth**

Classic homes, tree-lined streets, and a quieter vibe while still being close to all the action. It feels established and residential but still has coffee shops, restaurants, and the hospital nearby. Super popular with people who want charm + convenience. Very few apartments but there are some great options like Lincoln at Dilworth, Radius Dilworth and The Lexington Dilworth.



# Plaza Midwood

Eclectic, artsy, and packed with character. You’ll find bungalows, funky shops, and a ton of local food/drink spots. People who want something more unique and community-driven usually land here. One of the newest apartments is The Rowe at Commonwealth. I'd also recommend looking at Village at Commonwealth.  


# NoDa

The arts district. Murals, bars, live music, breweries, and a super walkable core around the light rail. It’s got its own personality and attracts people who want a creative, lively environment. 30Six NoDa is a great spot right on a light rail stop and Centro NoDa if you want one of the newest apartments in town.  


# SouthPark

More suburban-meets-upscale. Luxury apartments, high-end shopping, and a calmer lifestyle. Super popular among young professionals who want newer buildings, amenities, and quieter nights.

  


# Steele Creek / Lake Wylie

One of the fastest-growing areas. Tons of newer apartments and neighborhoods, easy access to the lake, and more space for the price. People who want something more relaxed but still close to the city look here.



# Ballantyne

If you like master-planned communities, parks, golf courses, and a polished suburban vibe, this is the spot. A ton of people with families gravitate here.  


# LoSo (Lower South End)

Basically an extension of South End but more brewery-heavy and industrial-turned-trendy. Super popular for people who love nightlife and social energy. You can get a great apartment deal here because there's so many options to choose from. Check out Alexan LoSo, Southerly LoSo and The Kingsman.

  


**Big takeaway:** Charlotte doesn’t really have a one-size-fits-all neighborhood. It just depends on what vibe, budget, and commute you want. But the areas above are consistently the most in-demand and the ones people talk about the most when relocating.

1phaf7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1phaf7m/best_vpn_for_crypto_trading/,Best VPN for Crypto Trading,"Between 2011 and 2021, over $12 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen from traders and exchanges. In 2025, the threats haven't diminished—they've evolved. From sophisticated phishing attacks to IP-based targeting, crypto traders face unique security challenges that demand more than just a strong password.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) has become an essential tool for serious crypto traders. It encrypts your internet traffic, masks your IP address, and helps you access region-locked exchanges while protecting your valuable assets. But not all VPNs are created equal—especially when milliseconds can mean the difference between profit and loss.

This guide examines the best VPNs for crypto trading, evaluating them on security features, connection speeds, and crypto-specific capabilities. Whether you're trading Bitcoin on Coinbase, exploring DeFi platforms, or accessing international exchanges, you'll find a solution that balances security, performance, and value.

# Quick Comparison: Top VPNs for Crypto Trading

|VPN|Best For|Starting Price|Server Count|Kill Switch|Accepts Crypto|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**NordVPN**|Overall Best|$3.09/month|7,200+ in 118 countries|✅|✅ Bitcoin, Ethereum|
|**Surfshark**|Budget Choice|$2.19/month|3,200+ in 100 countries|✅|✅ Multiple coins|
|**ExpressVPN**|Beginners|$4.99/month|3,000+ in 105 countries|✅|✅ Bitcoin via BitPay|
|**Proton VPN**|Best Free Option|$0 (Free tier)|500+ in 67 countries|✅|✅ Bitcoin only|
|**Private Internet Access**|Value Pick|$2.19/month|2,400+ in 105+ countries|✅|✅ Via BitPay|
|**CyberGhost**|Ease of Use|$2.11/month|9,000+ in 90 countries|✅|❌|

# Why Crypto Traders Need a VPN

# 1. Protection Against Hackers and Data Thieves

Cryptocurrencies aren't fully anonymous—they're pseudonymous. Forensic firms and malicious actors can link your wallet addresses to your real identity through your IP address. Once they have this information, you become a target for:

* **Phishing attacks** tailored to your trading patterns
* **Targeted malware** designed to steal private keys
* **SIM-swapping attacks** to bypass two-factor authentication
* **Physical threats** if large holdings are discovered

A VPN encrypts your internet traffic and masks your real IP address, making it significantly harder for attackers to connect your on-chain activity to your physical identity.

# 2. Access Geo-Restricted Exchanges

Many crypto exchanges enforce strict geographic restrictions due to regulatory compliance. For example:

* [**Binance.com**](http://Binance.com) is blocked in the US, Canada, and several other countries
* **Bybit** restricts access from the UK
* **Kraken** is unavailable in certain US states like New York and Texas
* **Deribit** blocks UK visitors

A VPN allows you to connect through servers in supported countries, bypassing these restrictions. However, this comes with important caveats about terms of service violations (more on this later).

# 3. Prevent ISP Throttling

Internet service providers have been known to throttle bandwidth for users engaged in high-traffic activities. Crypto trading—with its constant price checks, order executions, and API calls—can trigger throttling. Since your ISP can't see your encrypted VPN traffic, they can't selectively slow down your trading activities.

# 4. Secure Public WiFi Trading

Trading from airports, coffee shops, or hotels exposes you to man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured networks. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the exchange, preventing attackers on the same network from intercepting your login credentials or transaction data.

# Essential Features for Crypto Trading VPNs

Not every VPN is suitable for crypto trading. Look for these critical features:

# 1. Kill Switch (Non-Negotiable)

If your VPN connection drops unexpectedly, a kill switch instantly cuts your internet connection, preventing your real IP address from being exposed. Without this, a momentary disconnection could reveal your location to exchanges, surveillance firms, or attackers.

# 2. Audited No-Logs Policy

A VPN that keeps activity logs defeats the purpose of using one. Look for providers with independently audited no-logs policies (verified by firms like Deloitte, KPMG, or PwC). This ensures that even if authorities request data, there's nothing to hand over.

# 3. RAM-Only Servers

Modern VPNs run entirely on volatile RAM rather than hard drives. When servers reboot, all data is automatically wiped, making it impossible to store browsing history or connection logs.

# 4. High-Speed, Low-Latency Connections

In crypto trading, milliseconds matter. A CSIRO study found that the best VPNs using WireGuard protocol cause only 3-11% speed degradation. For high-frequency traders or those executing time-sensitive arbitrage, this difference is crucial.

# 5. DNS and IP Leak Protection

A ""leaky"" VPN can expose your real DNS requests or IP address despite appearing connected. All recommended VPNs have been independently tested for leak protection.

# 6. Strong Encryption Standards

AES-256 encryption is the industry standard, used by governments and militaries worldwide. Combined with secure protocols like WireGuard or OpenVPN, it ensures your trading data remains indecipherable.

# Best VPNs for Crypto Trading: Detailed Reviews

# 1. NordVPN — Best Overall for Crypto Trading

**Starting Price:** $3.09/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Network:** 7,200+ servers in 118 countries  
**Speed:** Near 1 Gbps with NordLynx protocol (3-11% degradation)  
**Accepts Crypto:** Yes (Bitcoin, Ethereum via CoinPayments)

**Why It's Best for Crypto:**

NordVPN dominates the crypto VPN space for good reason. Its NordLynx protocol—built on WireGuard—delivers exceptional speeds crucial for real-time trading. With over 7,200 RAM-only servers globally, you'll always find a low-latency connection near major exchanges.

The standout feature for crypto traders is **Threat Protection Pro**, which includes a crypto wallet address checker that verifies recipient addresses before transactions, helping prevent send-to-wrong-address scams. It also blocks malware, phishing domains, and trackers that specifically target crypto users.

NordVPN offers specialized servers:

* **Double VPN**: Routes traffic through two servers for extra encryption
* **Onion over VPN**: Combines VPN with Tor network for maximum anonymity
* **Obfuscated servers**: Makes VPN traffic look like regular HTTPS traffic, useful in countries that restrict VPNs

**Best For:** Serious traders who prioritize security and travel frequently between countries with different exchange restrictions.

**Potential Drawback:** Threat Protection Pro requires a higher-tier subscription plan. The basic plan doesn't include all crypto-specific features.

**Verdict:** If you're managing significant crypto assets and want top-tier protection without compromising on speed, NordVPN justifies its slightly higher price point.

# 2. Surfshark — Best Budget VPN for Crypto

**Starting Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Network:** 3,200+ servers in 100 countries  
**Speed:** 289 Mbps average with WireGuard (7.76% degradation)  
**Accepts Crypto:** Yes (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Litecoin, Tron via CoinGate)

**Why It's Great for Crypto:**

Surfshark delivers premium features at a fraction of the cost. Its standout feature is **unlimited simultaneous device connections**—unmatched in the industry. You can protect your phone, laptop, tablet, and even your partner's devices with a single subscription.

Speed tests show Surfshark actually outperforms more expensive competitors, with speeds exceeding 800 Mbps on US servers. For crypto traders, this means no lag when executing time-sensitive orders.

The **MultiHop** feature routes your connection through two countries simultaneously, and the new Dynamic MultiHop lets you choose your own country combinations for customized privacy.

Surfshark includes built-in **antivirus** that scored excellent ratings in AV-TEST's June 2025 evaluations—crucial protection against malware specifically designed to steal crypto wallet credentials.

**Best For:** Budget-conscious traders who need to protect multiple devices, or families sharing trading resources.

**Potential Drawback:** Smaller server network than NordVPN, though still adequate for most traders.

**Verdict:** At $2.19/month, Surfshark offers unbeatable value without compromising on security or speed. It's the smart choice for traders who want premium protection without the premium price.

# 3. ExpressVPN — Best for VPN Beginners

**Starting Price:** $4.99/month (12-month plan)  
**Server Network:** 3,000+ servers in 105 countries  
**Speed:** Excellent with Lightway protocol  
**Accepts Crypto:** Yes (Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum via BitPay)

**Why It's Ideal for Beginners:**

ExpressVPN wins on simplicity and reliability. Its apps are incredibly intuitive—you can be connected and trading securely within 60 seconds of installation. The ""Smart Location"" feature automatically selects the fastest server based on your location, removing guesswork for new VPN users.

All ExpressVPN servers run entirely on RAM (TrustedServer technology), wiping data with every reboot. The no-logs policy has been independently audited three times, most recently by KPMG in June 2025.

The **Lightway protocol** is optimized for battery efficiency on mobile devices while maintaining high speeds—perfect for traders who monitor markets on the go.

ExpressVPN Keys password manager is included, offering secure storage for your exchange login credentials and wallet recovery phrases.

**Best For:** Traders new to VPNs who want a ""set it and forget it"" solution with excellent customer support.

**Potential Drawback:** More expensive than NordVPN and Surfshark, especially beyond the first subscription period.

**Verdict:** Worth the premium for beginners who value simplicity and proven reliability. The learning curve is nonexistent, and 24/7 live support handles any issues quickly.

# 4. Proton VPN — Best Free Option

**Starting Price:** Free (Paid plans from $3.59/month)  
**Server Network:** 11,000+ servers in 110 countries (117 on paid plans)  
**Speed:** Near 950 Mbps with WireGuard in 2025 tests  
**Accepts Crypto:** Bitcoin only (on upgrades from free plan)

**Why the Free Tier Works for Crypto:**

Proton VPN is the **only free VPN we recommend for crypto trading**. Unlike sketchy free VPNs that log and sell your data, Proton's free tier offers:

* **Unlimited bandwidth** (no monthly data caps)
* **Kill switch** included (critical for security)
* **Strong encryption** (same as paid users)
* Servers in 5 countries (US, Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Poland)

Based in Switzerland with some of the world's strictest privacy laws, Proton VPN follows a strict no-logs policy verified by independent audits. The service is open-source, meaning security researchers can verify there are no hidden backdoors.

The paid upgrade adds access to 117 countries, **Secure Core** (routes through privacy-friendly countries first), and NetShield ad/malware blocker.

**Best For:** Traders who need basic VPN protection but can't afford paid services, or those wanting to test VPN crypto trading risk-free.

**Potential Drawback:** Free tier limits you to servers in 5 countries and doesn't let you choose specific server locations (only country).

**Verdict:** Proton VPN free is acceptable for casual trading, but serious traders should upgrade for the Secure Core feature and expanded server access.

# 5. Private Internet Access (PIA) — Great Value

**Starting Price:** $2.19/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Network:** 2,400+ servers in 105+ countries  
**Speed:** Excellent with WireGuard support  
**Accepts Crypto:** Yes (Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin via BitPay)

**Why Traders Like PIA:**

Private Internet Access offers a rare combination: rock-bottom pricing with no compromise on security. It supports **torrenting on all servers**, making it ideal for traders who also participate in blockchain node operations or share large data files.

PIA provides **port forwarding** and SOCKS5 proxy connections—advanced features that sophisticated traders use for running crypto mining operations or operating full blockchain nodes.

The **email breach monitor** alerts you if your email address appears in data breaches, helping you secure exchange accounts before attackers can exploit compromised credentials.

Apps are straightforward and simple to navigate, earning PIA high marks from users new to VPN technology.

**Best For:** Tech-savvy traders who want advanced features at a budget price, or those who combine crypto trading with blockchain participation.

**Potential Drawback:** Based in the US (Five Eyes jurisdiction), though the audited no-logs policy mitigates this concern.

**Verdict:** Excellent value at $2.19/month for traders who appreciate technical flexibility and don't mind the US jurisdiction.

# 6. CyberGhost — Most Beginner-Friendly

**Starting Price:** $2.11/month (2-year plan)  
**Server Network:** 9,000+ servers in 90 countries  
**Speed:** Reliable with optimized servers  
**Accepts Crypto:** No (traditional payments only)

**Why It's Easiest to Use:**

CyberGhost offers the largest server network on this list—over 9,000 servers worldwide. More servers mean less congestion and better chances of finding a fast connection near your preferred exchange.

The interface is extremely user-friendly with pre-configured profiles for different activities. Simply select ""Browse Anonymously"" or ""Unblock Streaming"" and CyberGhost handles the technical details.

**45-day money-back guarantee** is the longest in the industry, giving you over six weeks to test it risk-free with real trading scenarios.

Apps support up to 7 simultaneous device connections, covering most household needs.

**Best For:** Complete VPN beginners who want maximum simplicity and the longest trial period.

**Potential Drawback:** Doesn't accept cryptocurrency payments, which reduces payment anonymity.

**Verdict:** If ease of use is your top priority and you don't need crypto payment options, CyberGhost's massive server network and extended guarantee make it hard to beat.

# Free VPNs: Can You Trade Crypto Safely?

**Short answer: Almost never.**

A 2020 CSIRO (Australian government research agency) study found that **75% of free VPN apps include tracking libraries and 38% contain malware**. These aren't hypothetical risks—free VPNs have been caught:

* Logging and selling user browsing data to advertisers
* Injecting ads and malware into users' browsers
* Providing weak encryption that's easily broken
* Operating without kill switches, exposing your IP when connections drop
* Hosting hackers on their networks

**Why are free VPNs dangerous for crypto specifically?**

If you're not paying for the product, **you ARE the product**. Free VPN providers must monetize somehow, and they typically do it by:

1. Tracking your online activity (including exchange visits)
2. Selling your browsing data to the highest bidder
3. Injecting cryptocurrency mining scripts into your browser
4. Exposing you to targeted crypto phishing attacks

**The One Exception: Proton VPN Free**

Proton VPN's free tier is the only free option we recommend. It's funded by paid users and offers:

* Unlimited bandwidth (no data caps)
* Kill switch included
* No-logs policy (independently audited)
* No malware, no tracking, no data selling

However, even Proton VPN Free has limitations (only 5 country options, can't choose specific servers), so serious traders should upgrade to a paid plan.

**Bottom Line:** The money you ""save"" with free VPNs will cost you far more when a compromised connection leads to stolen crypto. Budget VPNs like Surfshark ($2.19/month) offer infinitely better security for less than a cup of coffee.

# Legal and Terms of Service Considerations

# Is Using a VPN for Crypto Trading Legal?

**Yes, in most countries.** VPN usage is legal in the United States, Canada, UK, European Union, and most developed nations. You're within your rights to protect your privacy and encrypt your internet traffic.

**However**, some countries restrict or ban VPNs:

* **China**: Only government-approved VPNs allowed
* **Russia**: Restricted to approved providers
* **UAE**: Limited to approved services
* **North Korea, Belarus, Turkmenistan**: VPNs banned entirely

# The Terms of Service Problem

Here's where it gets complicated: **Using a VPN may be legal, but it can violate exchange terms of service.**

**Binance Example:**  
Binance's TOS explicitly prohibits US residents from using VPNs to access [Binance.com](http://Binance.com) (the international version). If caught:

* Your account could be suspended indefinitely
* Funds could be frozen
* Withdrawals may be blocked until you verify non-US residency

Binance actively detects and blocks known VPN IP addresses. While you might get through initially, their systems are constantly updated to identify VPN traffic.

**Other Major Exchanges:**

* **Coinbase**: May detect VPNs and trigger device confirmation emails, but doesn't explicitly ban them
* **Kraken**: More tolerant, focuses on strong account security (2FA, recovery keys)
* **Gemini**: Blocks access from restricted states but doesn't specifically target VPNs

# KYC Conflicts

If an exchange requires Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, using a VPN to appear in a different country creates a mismatch:

* Your KYC documents show you're in Country A
* Your login IP (via VPN) shows you're in Country B
* This discrepancy can trigger automatic account reviews or freezes

# IRS and Tax Reporting (US Traders)

**Important:** The IRS doesn't track or care about VPN usage itself. However:

* All crypto income must be reported, regardless of where/how you traded
* Foreign exchange data is shared with IRS through international agreements
* Using a VPN doesn't exempt you from tax obligations
* Attempting to hide income via VPN is tax evasion (illegal)

**Legal consensus from tax experts:** Using a VPN to trade on foreign exchanges isn't illegal IF you report all gains/losses. The IRS cares about tax compliance, not how you accessed the exchange.

# Recommendations for Staying Compliant

1. **If in a restricted region**: Use [Binance.US](http://Binance.US), Coinbase, or other local-compliant exchanges rather than VPNing to international platforms
2. **If traveling**: Use VPN for security, but be prepared to verify your actual location if questioned
3. **For privacy**: VPNs are legitimate security tools—just don't use them to circumvent regulations you're legally bound to follow
4. **Always report**: Declare all crypto income on tax returns, regardless of VPN use

# How to Set Up Your VPN for Crypto Trading

# Step-by-Step Setup:

**1. Choose and Subscribe to a Reputable VPN**  
Select from the reviewed options above based on your needs and budget. For this example, we'll use NordVPN.

**2. Download and Install**

* Visit the VPN provider's website and download the app for your device (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, Linux)
* Install following the prompts—this typically takes 2-3 minutes
* Sign in with the credentials from your subscription

**3. Configure Critical Settings** Before connecting, enable these essential features:

* **Kill Switch**: Turn ON (usually under Settings > Advanced)
* **DNS Leak Protection**: Verify it's enabled
* **Protocol Selection**: Choose WireGuard for speed (or OpenVPN for maximum compatibility)

**4. Select an Optimal Server**

* For **security-focused trading**: Choose a server in Switzerland, Iceland, or Panama (strong privacy laws)
* For **speed-focused trading**: Connect to a server geographically close to your exchange's data center
* For **accessing geo-blocked exchanges**: Select a server in a country where that exchange operates legally

**5. Test Your Connection** Before trading, verify your VPN is working:

* Visit [ipleak.net](http://ipleak.net) to confirm your real IP is hidden
* Check for DNS leaks using the site's tool
* Test your trading platform loads normally

**6. Optional: Configure Split Tunneling** Advanced users can route only crypto trading apps through the VPN while other traffic uses regular internet:

* Go to Settings > Split Tunneling
* Add your exchange apps/websites to the VPN tunnel
* Leave other apps (streaming, gaming) outside the tunnel for maximum speed

**Pro Tip:** If you frequently switch between exchanges, save server presets. Most VPNs let you favorite specific servers for one-click connection.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will a VPN slow down my crypto trading?**  
A: High-quality VPNs cause minimal slowdown (3-11% speed reduction). Modern protocols like WireGuard are optimized for speed. In some cases, VPNs can actually improve speeds by bypassing ISP throttling.

**Q: Can Binance and other exchanges detect VPN usage?**  
A: Yes. Major exchanges maintain databases of known VPN IP addresses and can detect when you're using one. Some exchanges block access from obvious VPN IPs, while others flag accounts for review. Obfuscated servers (NordVPN, Surfshark) can help mask VPN usage, but detection is always possible.

**Q: Should I use a dedicated IP address for crypto trading?**  
A: Dedicated IPs have pros and cons. **Pros**: Fewer CAPTCHAs, less risk of being flagged by exchanges, consistent login location. **Cons**: More expensive, less privacy (same IP always linked to you). For most traders, shared IPs are sufficient.

**Q: Can I trade crypto on public WiFi with a VPN?**  
A: Yes, and you absolutely should. Public WiFi networks are notoriously insecure, making you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. A VPN encrypts all your traffic, preventing anyone on the network from intercepting your login credentials or transaction data.

**Q: Do I need a VPN if I'm only using a hardware wallet?**  
A: While hardware wallets store your private keys offline (excellent security), you still interact with exchanges and blockchain explorers through your internet connection. A VPN protects these online activities, prevents IP-based tracking of your wallet addresses, and secures your data when checking balances or broadcasting transactions.

**Q: What's the best VPN server location for crypto trading?**  
A: It depends on your goal. **For privacy**: Switzerland, Iceland, or British Virgin Islands have strong privacy protections. **For speed**: Choose servers geographically close to your exchange's data centers (Singapore for Asian exchanges, Frankfurt for European exchanges, New York/Virginia for US exchanges). **For access**: Select servers in countries where your target exchange operates legally.

**Q: Can I pay for VPN subscriptions with cryptocurrency?**  
A: Yes! Most top VPNs accept crypto:

* **NordVPN**: Bitcoin, Ethereum (via CoinPayments)
* **Surfshark**: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Litecoin, Tron (via CoinGate)
* **ExpressVPN**: Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum (via BitPay)
* **Proton VPN**: Bitcoin only (when upgrading from free plan)
* **PIA**: Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, Litecoin (via BitPay)

Paying with crypto adds an extra layer of anonymity, as your subscription isn't linked to credit card information.

# Conclusion: Protect Your Crypto with the Right VPN

With billions of dollars in cryptocurrency stolen annually and exchanges implementing increasingly sophisticated geo-restrictions, a reliable VPN isn't optional for serious traders—it's essential infrastructure.

**Our Recommendations:**

* **Best Overall**: **NordVPN** offers the most comprehensive security features specifically designed for crypto traders, including Threat Protection Pro and wallet address verification. At $3.09/month, it's worth the investment for anyone managing significant holdings.
* **Best Value**: **Surfshark** delivers premium security at budget pricing ($2.19/month) with unlimited device connections—perfect for traders who need to protect multiple devices or share with family.
* **Best for Beginners**: **ExpressVPN** makes VPN protection effortless with its intuitive interface and automatic server selection, ideal for traders new to VPNs who want reliable protection without complexity.
* **Best Free Option**: **Proton VPN's free tier** is the only no-cost option we recommend, offering unlimited bandwidth and essential security features—acceptable for casual trading, though serious traders should upgrade.

**Critical Reminders:**

1. **Never use free VPNs** (except Proton) for crypto trading—the security risks far outweigh any savings
2. **Enable kill switches** before connecting to ensure your IP never leaks during disconnections
3. **Understand TOS implications** before using VPNs to access geo-blocked exchanges
4. **Always report crypto income** to tax authorities, regardless of VPN usage
5. **Combine VPN with other security** like hardware wallets, strong 2FA, and unique passwords

The crypto landscape is more dangerous than ever, but with the right VPN and security practices, you can trade confidently knowing your digital assets and personal information remain protected.

1phabfm,https://i.redd.it/454rhj2yvy5g1.jpeg,Hot vs cold water in Moka pot,"Moka pot: Bialetti 3-cup

Coffee beans tried: Attikan Estate, Baarbara Estate, Silver Oak Blend



I started my coffee journey with a Moka pot around 3 months ago. Before that I was using instant coffee, so naturally it was a huge upgrade for me. I drink my coffee black, so I didn't like darker roasts such as Vienna Roast, although they tasted great in my cold coffee. I shifted towards medium roasts such as Silver Oak Blend.

I was told that the Moka pot is unforgivable, and so I tried to learn from multiple sources -- blogs, subreddits, James Hoffman's videos; you name it, I've seen it. Over time, I experiemented with multiple variables, be it the grind size, coffee-to-water ratio, or the amount of coffee extracted. However, I soon started questioning my brews when I was able to have entire 3-cup Moka pot brews, three times a day, with barely any caffeine kick.

Turns out, the ""fruity"" notes I was actually enjoying were nothing but sourness from under-extracted coffee. To confirm this, I went towards medium-dark roasts, the Attikan Estate and Baarbara Estate. Even with these beans, I was getting a sour flavor. I tried grinding finer to increase the contact area, started with boiling water in the chamber to increase extraction temperature, and extracting less coffee to avoid unintended flavors at the end. The coffee still didn't improve. There would occasionally be times when I would be ""yeah this tastes better,"" but it would start tasting sour once it cooled down a bit more in my cup.  
  
While experimenting with all these variables, the only constant was the water temperature in the bottom chamber -- off-boil. But, then I started reading about the divide in the community on using hot/cold water in the chamber. My previous assumption was that cold water will require more time on the stove, which will make the heat burn the coffee. However, when I saw that even BT recommends 50/50 hot/cold water (50-60 deg. C) for their medium-dark roasts, I decided to give it a shot.  
  
Today was the best cup of coffee I have ever brewed. I used 80g room temp water, and 60g boiling water in the bottom chamber. I used 15g of coffee beans, with light sideways tapping of the funnel to even out the grounds. I brewed on the lowest flame possible, and avoided any increase in output flow or sputtering. It took the brew around 5 min from the time I put it on the flame. I got an output of 80g brewed coffee from a start of 140g water.

Here's my two cents on why not using boiling/off-boil water might be a better idea. I figured that all variables discussed try to increase extraction, either through more contact with the grounds, or higher temperature to extract better. However, these variables do not account for the contact time with the coffee. In a small Moka pot like the 3-cup, starting with boiling water results in a harder-to-maintain steam flow through the funnel, as the latent heat of vaporization is higher. So, with even a small heat delta the flow changes drastically. Because of this, the water was flowing through my coffe extremely quickly, even when I tried to control it. I was getting a <1 min extraction, after the coffee started coming out.

I understand that with lighter roasts, it'll probably be necessary to use boiling water to extract better, and extraction might be even easier with darker roasts. Also, it might be easier to work with larger capacity pots than smaller ones. Moreover, my understanding that using colder water will lead to the coffee being burnt and bitter was definitely shattered today. The coffee was just perfect and soothing.

1phaab3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1phaab3/successful_cycling_tourism_in_istanbul/,Successful cycling tourism in Istanbul,"Greetings,

In the last few years, I have been doing all kinds of cycling and finding cheap tickets for Istanbul, I went for it. For various reasons, I decided to rent bikes locally instead of bringing my own. 

Securing bikes beforehand proved impossible as the few shops that seemed capable of renting, didn't respond. Thus, I decided to search for bikes when I landed which proved quite difficult. I spent hours going from shop to shop on the Anatolian side, close to the sea where there are many well reviewed shops. Most didn't rent at all, istanbul Bisiklet Bike & Outdoor Kadikoy had some at bad condition, a couple of premium shops asked ridiculous prices like 30-50€ per day for carbon roadbikes (Atölye 25.4).

Only Gursel Akay Bisiklet and Stride Bike N Coffee offered decent bikes for a reasonable price, 100€ for 8 full days. I went with Gursel's because it was a more traditional bike shop and coming unprepared, I had need of everything (helmets, pump, tubes, lights etc.) which he generously provided. With the two trekking/fitness bikes, me and my brother, managed to explore this vast city, doing around 430km with +6000m elevation. The bikes performed well, even in off-road conditions in the forests.

Cycling in Istanbul is challenging. The city is endless, hilly, cobblestones aplenty, rainy and some areas seem randomly closed due to military/private resorts. It also takes some time to understand how metros/bridges/ferrys connect the three sides. Last but not least, it has a chaotic driving environment. Coming from Athens, I got used to it fast but even for me, there were a couple of sketchy moments with taxi drivers and scooters doing crazy stuff. I recommend it only for strong riders that have experience in this kind of driving.

For the routes, I couldn't find much from others so I planned all of them myself. I used gpx studio, selecting road bike when I wanted fast main asphalt roads and gravel bike when I wanted smaller byways or forest roads. The idea was to explore the landmarks, parks, coastline and forests. I recommend the Karakoy-Rumelifeneri coastline, Anadolu Kavagi-Pendik coastline, Prince's islands, Polonezkoy forest, Belgrad forest.

It changes you. Completely.
Life gets stripped down to the basics: somewhere dry to sleep, enough food to stop the shaking, staying safe, and the occasional bit of human connection.
For years I lived on almost nothing. I learned every trick – which supermarkets reduce stuff at what time, the warm spots nobody talks about, how to sleep rough when it’s minus degrees and not lose toes, how to look “normal” enough that security leave you alone.
Every single day is uncertainty. You wake up not knowing where you’ll sleep that night or whether you’ll eat properly. And you carry that weight 24/7.
But something weird happens after a while.
You get strong in ways housed people never understand. You learn what actually matters and what’s just noise. You stop caring about designer clothes, big TVs, or “career progression”. You realise freedom tastes better than any salary ever felt.

Every connection is an opportunity for your data to be intercepted, tracked, or stolen. With an estimated 3.9 billion Android users worldwide, mobile devices have become prime targets for hackers, advertisers, and surveillance.

The good news? A quality VPN for Android can protect your privacy, encrypt your connection, and unlock geo-restricted content—all while running seamlessly in the background. The challenge is that the Google Play Store is flooded with unreliable and even dangerous VPN apps that harvest your data instead of protecting it.

After extensive testing of over 50 Android VPN apps in 2025, we've identified the top performers that deliver genuine security, excellent performance, and Android-optimized features.

**For Privacy:** Proton VPN offers Swiss laws and unlimited free data. NordVPN provides advanced features like Double VPN.

**For Budget:** Surfshark ($2.19/month) offers the best value with unlimited connections. Proton VPN's free tier is excellent for single-device users.

**For Gaming:** NordVPN's minimal speed loss (3-6%) provides the lowest latency for mobile gaming.

**For Torrenting:** IPVanish with SOCKS5 proxy or Surfshark with unlimited bandwidth work best.

# Setting Up a VPN on Android (Quick Guide)

1. **Download Your VPN**: Visit Google Play Store and install your chosen VPN app
2. **Create Account**: Sign up directly in the app or on the provider's website
3. **Log In**: Enter your credentials in the Android app
4. **Grant Permissions**: Allow VPN configuration when prompted
5. **Connect**: Tap the connect button or select a specific server
6. **Enable Always-On** (Optional): Settings → Network & Internet → VPN → Toggle Always-On

**Pro Tip:** Most VPNs offer 7-day free trials through Google Play, but purchasing directly from the provider's website usually gets you a 30-day money-back guarantee—a better deal for testing.

# Free vs. Paid VPNs on Android: A Critical Warning

**The harsh truth:** Most free VPNs are dangerous. Studies have found that free VPN apps on the Play Store often:

* Harvest and sell your browsing data
* Inject ads and tracking scripts
* Host malware and spyware
* Offer weak encryption or none at all
* Leak your IP address

**The Exception:** Proton VPN's free tier is safe, legitimate, and funded by paid subscriptions. It's the only free VPN we recommend.

**Why Paid VPNs Are Worth It:**

* Unlimited data and bandwidth
* Faster speeds (10-20x faster than free)
* No logs of your activity
* Better streaming unblocking
* 24/7 customer support
* Advanced security features
* Costs $2-5/month with long-term plans

# Conclusion

If you're serious about protecting your Android device, **NordVPN** is our top recommendation for 2025. Its combination of blazing-fast speeds, comprehensive security, and Android-optimized features make it worth the investment at $2.99/month. With 7,600+ servers, a 4.6/5 Play Store rating, and recent innovations like scam call protection, it's simply the best all-around Android VPN.

However, **Surfshark** ($2.19/month) offers incredible value if you need to protect multiple devices, while **Proton VPN** provides the only trustworthy free option with unlimited data.

Avoid unknown free VPNs from the Play Store—they're more likely to steal your data than protect it. Stick with the reputable providers in this guide, and your Android device will be secure whether you're browsing at home, streaming on the go, or connecting to sketchy public WiFi.

**Remember:** All the VPNs in this guide offer 30-day money-back guarantees. Test them risk-free and choose the one that fits your needs. Your Android's security is too important to leave to chance.",2,1765193665.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

**SUPERNOVA**

**BLURB**: Jackson Krishna was more than a musician—he was a myth in the making. An Indian-born, LA-based rock star who despised electronic music and worshipped the rock scene from the 70s to the 90s, he lived fast and died young. He had always believed in the poetry of early death, surviving 27 only to die at 37 just days past his birthday on a Dubai expressway, swerving to avoid a parked car, his body crushed beneath the weight of his own momentum. His death was instant. The consequences were not. In the days that follow, the world fractures into factions—his fans, his family, the industry that owned him, the media that deified and dissected him. Jackson Krishna, the man, is gone. But Jackson Krishna, the myth, is just beginning.

**Questions Raised About Possible Intoxication Prior to Crash**

Sources close to the Dubai investigation have indicated that authorities are “examining all potential contributing factors” in the death of internationally recognized musician Jackson Krishna, including whether alcohol consumption may have played a role.

While Dubai Police have made no official statement on the matter, two individuals familiar with standard post-collision procedures note that toxicology screenings are routinely conducted “in incidents of this severity.”

A spokesperson for the Dubai Health Authority declined to comment on “ongoing forensic processes,” and representatives for Krishna’s management team have not responded to repeated requests for clarification.

The suggestion has already sparked sharp disagreement online, with fans disputing any implication of misconduct. As of publication, no verified toxicology report has been released, and all claims remain unconfirmed.

Marianne Graves, ‘Mari’ to most, sits behind the counter of her café, the morning rush thinning into its usual mid-morning lull. Her phone screen brightens with the new headline, the bolded words *“Possible Intoxication”* reflecting in the metallic pitcher she’s just rinsed. She doesn’t click it at first. She just stares, thumb hovering, jaw still. When she finally opens the article, she reads every sentence twice, then once more, slower, lips pressed into a straight line. The espresso machine hisses behind her, but she doesn’t move. Customers speak, order, laugh. None of it reaches her.

When her timer beeps, she realizes she’s been holding the portafilter in midair for almost a minute. She slides it into place, forces herself back into motion, and the café resumes around her even as the article waits on her phone, screen dimming, never closing.

**HAMPI, KARNATAKA, INDIA**

In Hampi, the television in the small living room plays the same news clip on loop, a presenter speaking Kannada over an earlier English broadcast. Jackson’s mother sits on the edge of the sofa, hands folded tightly in her lap, a cup of coffee cooling untouched beside her. His father stands near the open window, the slow churn of the ceiling fan pushing warm air past him as the afternoon light flickers against the curtains. The headline at the bottom of the screen scrolls: *“Investigators Consider Intoxication Among Possible Factors.”*

Neither of them reacts. They simply watch the screen glow against the afternoon light, the reporter’s voice rising and falling, repeating details that shift slightly each hour. The TV stays on even when the clip ends and restarts, the same sentences drifting through the room like dust, settling without sinking.",1,1765193575.0,BetaReaders,1,1.0,False

1pha3jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/SearchEngineGuy/comments/1pha3jl/using_lsi_semantic_keywords_to_improve_content/,Using LSI & Semantic Keywords to Improve Content Relevance,"Search engine optimization (SEO) has evolved far beyond stuffing exact-match keywords into articles. Today, Google relies on semantic search—its ability to understand concepts, relationships, and context—to identify what content is truly relevant to a user’s query. This is where **LSI keywords** and **semantic keywords** become powerful tools for content creators.

When used properly, they help search engines better understand your content, improve topical depth, and significantly boost rankings. This article explores what they are, how they work, and how you can strategically incorporate them into your writing.

# What Are LSI Keywords? (And What They Are NOT)

**LSI** stands for **Latent Semantic Indexing**, an old information retrieval method from the 1980s. While Google does not literally use LSI, the SEO industry uses the term *“LSI keywords”* to refer to:

>

For example, if your main keyword is **“Apple”**, semantic signals help Google determine **whether you mean the fruit or the tech company**.

# Common examples:

|Main Keyword|Related (LSI/Semantic) Keywords|
|:-|:-|
|Apple|iPhone, MacBook, iOS, Tim Cook|
|Coffee|espresso, caffeine, roasting, cold brew|
|SEO|search engine optimization, Google ranking, keywords, backlinks|

**LSI keywords are NOT:**

* Synonyms only
* Random keyword variations
* A replacement for primary keywords
* Something Google directly calls “LSI terms”

Instead, they are **context-building keywords** that help search engines understand what your content is truly about.

# What Are Semantic Keywords?

Semantic keywords go beyond simple related terms. They capture:

* **Context**
* [User intent](https://www.reddit.com/r/SearchEngineGuy/comments/1pc4z5l/understanding_search_intent_the_key_to/)
* **Conceptual relationships**
* **Topical relevance**

If your primary keyword is **“best running shoes”**, semantic keywords may include:

* stability shoes
* pronation
* heel-to-toe drop
* marathon training
* cushioning
* trail running shoes

These terms reflect deeper context, helping you cover the entire subject more comprehensively.

# Why Semantic Keywords Matter for SEO

# 1. They Strengthen Search Engine Understanding

Google’s algorithms (Hummingbird, RankBrain, BERT) rely on natural language processing (NLP) to understand context. Using semantic keywords signals:

* What topics your content covers
* How comprehensive it is
* Whether it aligns with search intent

This makes your content more likely to rank for both **primary** and **long-tail keywords**.

# 2. They Improve Topical Authority

Covering related concepts thoroughly positions your page as a trusted information source—what Google calls **“topical depth.”**

This increases your chances of ranking for:

* Long-tail variations
* Related searches
* Featured snippets

# 3. They Reduce Keyword Stuffing

Instead of repeating your main keyword 20 times, semantic keywords allow you to write naturally while staying relevant.

Example:

**Bad:**  
“Running shoes are very popular running shoes for runners who need running shoes.”

**Better:**  
“Modern running footwear offers better stability, cushioning, and support for all types of runners.”

# 4. They Help Capture More Search Intent Variations

Semantic keywords let you target:

* “How-to” intent
* “Best” or comparison intent
* “Definition” intent
* “Problem-solving” intent

For example, in an article about “dog training,” semantic terms like “positive reinforcement,” “leash training,” and “puppy behavior” help you satisfy diverse user needs.

# Where to Find LSI & Semantic Keywords

There are several sources where semantic signals naturally appear.

# 1. Google Autocomplete

Start typing a keyword in Google’s search bar. The autocomplete suggestions reflect the most common related queries.

Example: Typing “SEO tools” shows:

* seo tools for beginners
* seo tools free
* best seo tools 2025

These are perfect semantic extensions.

# 2. Google’s “People Also Ask”

This section reveals questions users commonly ask around your topic.

Example for “content marketing”:

* What is content marketing?
* Why is content marketing important?
* What are the 5 elements of content marketing?

These questions indicate **subtopics you should include**.

# 3. Google Related Searches

Scroll to the bottom of the SERP to find related searches.

Example for “cold brew coffee”:

* cold brew ratio
* how to make cold brew
* cold brew vs iced coffee
* cold brew concentrate

These often serve as semantic keywords or H2 headings.

# 4. Keyword Tools with Semantic Analysis

Tools like:

* **Surfer SEO**
* **Semrush SEO Writing Assistant**
* **Ahrefs Keywords Explorer**
* **Clearscope**

provide lists of NLP/semantic keywords based on top-ranking pages.

# 5. Competitor Content

Look at the highest-ranking articles for your keyword and observe:

* Subheadings
* Repeated phrases
* Related topics covered
* Terminology used

These often reveal semantic clusters you should include.

# How to Use Semantic Keywords in Your Content

Knowing what they are isn’t enough—how you apply them determines your SEO impact.

# 1. Use Semantic Keywords in Your H2/H3 Headings

Strong topic clusters need multiple subtopics.

Example: If your keyword is “keto diet,” semantic headings might include:

* What foods can you eat on keto?
* Keto benefits and side effects
* Ketosis vs. low-carb diets
* Sample keto meal plan
* How to track macros on keto

These headings show topical depth and help Google classify your content more accurately.

# 2. Include Them Naturally in Body Paragraphs

Avoid forcing them into your text. Instead, include them where they fit logically.

Example:  
A paragraph discussing “lifting shoes” can naturally include terms like “heel lift,” “stability,” and “Olympic lifting.”

# 3. Use Them in Image ALT Text

ALT text provides semantic clues for:

* Google Images ranking
* Contextual relevance
* Accessibility

Example:  
ALT: *“cold brew coffee concentrate in mason jar”*

# 4. Add Semantic Keywords in Meta Descriptions

While meta descriptions don't influence rankings directly, semantic relevance increases **click appeal**.

Example:  
“Learn how to make cold brew coffee, understand the perfect ratio, and explore brewing tips for rich, smooth flavor.”

# 5. Build Topic Clusters Around Semantic Themes

A powerful SEO approach is grouping semantically linked content.

Example topic cluster:

**Main pillar:**

* *Running Shoes: Complete Guide*

**Supporting articles (semantic keywords):**

* Best shoes for flat feet
* How to choose running shoes
* Running shoes for trail running
* Pronation explained
* Cushioning vs minimal shoes

This structure builds **topical authority** and **internal relevance**.

# 6. Avoid Overusing Semantic Keywords

While helpful, too many can:

* Overwhelm the user
* Dilute message clarity
* Make content feel unnatural

Aim for **balance over density.**

# Real Example: Applying Semantic Keywords

Let’s say you’re writing about “gardening tips.”

# Main Keyword:

gardening tips

# Semantic Keywords Might Include:

* soil quality
* fertilizer
* sunlight needs
* watering schedule
* pruning techniques
* pest control
* seasonal planting
* raised beds

# Example paragraph using semantic signals naturally:

“To maintain healthy plants, focus on soil quality and sunlight exposure. Most vegetables need at least six hours of direct light. Adjust your watering schedule based on the season, and use proper pruning techniques to help plants grow fuller. Consistent pest control also prevents insects from damaging your crops.”

This paragraph hits several semantic concepts—without stuffing keywords.

# Semantic Keywords and AI/Google NLP

Modern search relies heavily on **natural language processing (NLP)**. Tools like:

* Google NLP API
* Surfer SEO (NLP scoring)
* Clearscope (Content grade)

analyze content by identifying:

* Contextual meaning
* Entity relationships
* Topic comprehensiveness
* Missing semantic concepts

Using these tools can help you create *expert-level* content that aligns with Google’s modern ranking systems.

# Best Practices for Using Semantic Keywords

# ✔ Cover the topic completely

# ✔ Use LSI & semantic terms naturally

# ✔ Match user search intent

# ✔ Include semantic variations in headers

# ✔ Build internal links using semantic themes

# ✔ Analyze top competitors for patterns

# ✔ Prioritize readability over keyword frequency

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Overstuffing semantic keywords  
❌ Adding irrelevant “related terms” just to increase length  
❌ Focusing only on synonyms instead of conceptual relevance  
❌ Ignoring search intent  
❌ Not building content depth

# Final Thoughts

LSI and semantic keywords are essential for creating content that ranks well in the age of semantic search. They help Google understand your content, improve topical authority, increase relevance, and enhance user satisfaction. By integrating them naturally throughout your content—and supporting them with strong topic clusters—you can dramatically improve SEO performance and outrank competitors who still rely on outdated keyword strategies.",1,1765193417.0,SearchEngineGuy,0,1.0,False

Let me cook for you? 👨‍🍳💕,"Okkay so, I've gotten really good at being single, like really good. I have my routines, my hobbies, and my whole life figured out. But lately, I've realized that having everything together alone just makes me want to share it with someone 🥹

A bit about me: I'm 25, a software engineer from India currently doing my masters. I'm 5'09"" and I work out regularly (gym is my therapy lol), so I have a pretty fit athletic build. I wear glasses and I've been told I have a warm smile, but you can be the judge of that 😊

Interest wise, I'm into gaming, anime, k-dramas that destroy me emotionally, and hiking/trekking when I can. Also, I absolutely love cooking. Like, it's genuinely my happy place.

What I'm actually like:

I remember random things people tell me and bring them up weeks later (is this a superpower or am I just obsessive? unclear). I get genuinely excited about small things like perfecting a new recipe or finding the perfect song for a moment.

I'm the good morning how'd you sleep and did you eat today type of person. My love language is acts of service mixed with quality time, like I will cook your favorite meal while we watch something together. I'm emotionally available and actually want to talk about real stuff, not just surface level memes (though I love those too)

What I'm looking for:

Someone I can text first thing in the morning and last thing at night without it feeling forced. Someone who wants to share the small mundane stuff, like I saw this weird bird today or my coffee was perfect this morning.

I want someone I can be silly with but also have those deep late night convos about life and dreams and fears. Someone who appreciates effort and consistency and is okay with me getting attached and caring deeply because that's just how I'm wired.

What dating me looks like:

Imagine having someone who's genuinely invested in your day, who asks follow up questions about that thing you mentioned last week, who sends you songs saying this made me think of you.

Cozy nights where I cook us dinner (maybe in an apron because why not) and we just exist together watching shows or talking about everything and nothing. Having someone who's your biggest hype person but also your safe space when things get rough.

I'm open to long distance because honestly if we genuinely connect I don't care if you're across the world. I can travel and I'm willing to work towards eventually closing the gap if we build something real.

You don't need to be perfect (neither am I) or into all my hobbies. You just need to actually want something long term, put in effort because relationships are a two way street, and communicate when something's wrong instead of just disappearing.

If this resonates with you, tell me about the last thing that genuinely made you happy or your comfort show that you rewatch constantly. Let's see if we vibe and maybe turn this whole forever alone thing into a we found each other thing ✨

Fair warning: I will send you reels and memes at random hours, I will get excited about dumb things and I will probably care about you way more than socially acceptable, you've been warned 💕

1ph9y8s,https://i.redd.it/jcf0016nsy5g1.png,12:12 to New Year's: The 20-Day Energetic Bridge That Determines Your Entire 2026,"I remember the message that came through at 2:47 AM last December.

“I just realized I’ve been staring at my phone for three hours and I can’t remember a single thing I watched. My alarm goes off in four hours. This happens every night. What’s wrong with me?”

Nothing was wrong with her. Everything was wrong with how we’re being asked to live.

She worked in finance. Sixty-hour weeks that bled into weekends. Slack notifications at dinner. Her manager’s “just checking in” texts at 10 PM that were never just checking in. She’d trained herself to respond within minutes — to everything, everyone, always. Her phone had become an extension of her hand. Some nights she’d find herself scrolling through reels about self-care while ignoring the fact that she hadn’t felt genuinely rested in eight months.

The breaking point wasn’t dramatic. It was quiet. It was lying in bed, exhausted beyond words, but still refreshing her email. Still comparing her life to the highlight reels of people she’d never met. Still clicking “add to cart” on things she didn’t need because for three minutes, the dopamine hit felt like relief.

This is what I hear in December, every December. Not from people who are failing at life, but from people who are succeeding at everything except feeling alive.

They tell me they can’t focus on anything for more than ten minutes without reaching for their phone. They describe ordering dinner through an app while watching a show they’re not enjoying while texting someone they’re not interested in talking to — three forms of consumption happening simultaneously, none of them nourishing. They talk about Sunday scaries that start on Friday afternoon. They mention how they’ve automated everything — groceries, bills, even birthday gifts — but somehow have less time than ever. One woman told me she’d been using AI to write her work emails for six months and couldn’t remember the last time she’d had an original thought that wasn’t about a deadline.

This is the age we’re living in. The age of endless convenience that’s made us inconvenient to ourselves. Where everything is designed to be effortless, but being human has never felt harder.

I see it in my own life too. I’m a Reiki healer — someone who’s dedicated years to energy work and spiritual practice — and even I feel it. The pull to check my phone the moment I wake up. The way my mind has been trained to expect instant answers, instant results, instant everything. The exhaustion that comes not from doing too much, but from being energetically available to too much, all the time. December hits, and I can feel the weight of it — twelve months of living in a world that profits from my distraction, that’s gamified my attention, that has normalized depletion as the price of participation.

But here’s what I’ve learned: before you can change anything about your life, you have to change the energy you’re operating from. And there’s one moment each year when that becomes easier than it will ever be again.

# The 12:12 Portal: When the Universe Hands You a Reset Button

December 12th isn’t just another date. It’s an energetic gateway — a moment when the frequency of universal energy aligns in a way that makes transformation accessible. In my years of practice, I’ve watched what typically takes months of healing work happen in days during this window. Blocks that have been stuck for years suddenly shift. Patterns that felt permanent start to loosen.

Think about how you approach New Year’s resolutions. You wait until January 1st, feeling depleted and overwhelmed, and then you try to willpower your way into a new version of yourself. You promise you’ll finally get healthy, finally set boundaries, finally stop doomscrolling at 2 AM. And by February, you’re back where you started, except now you also feel like a failure.

But what if the problem isn’t your willpower? What if the problem is that you’re trying to plant seeds in concrete?

The twenty days between December 12th and January 1st aren’t filler time between holiday parties. They’re your cosmic runway — the bridge between who you’ve been and who you’re capable of becoming. This is the period where you either drag the same exhausted energy into 2026, or you consciously clear it and start fresh.

Most people miss this completely. They’re so focused on surviving December — the deadlines, the social obligations, the family dynamics, the end-of-year pressure — that they arrive at January 1st running on fumes, trying to manifest abundance from a place of absolute depletion.

The 12:12 portal is your chance to stop that cycle before it starts again.

Last year, I worked with someone through the [coto](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb) platform who’d describe her life as “successful on paper, empty in reality.” Senior marketing role, beautiful apartment, active social life, but completely disconnected from herself. She’d been in therapy for two years working on her anxiety, but something wasn’t shifting. During our first session on December 12th, she didn’t have some dramatic breakthrough. She just cried — the kind of crying that comes when you finally stop holding everything together and let yourself feel how tired you actually are.

Over the next five days, we worked through layers of energetic clearing. Not talking about her problems, but addressing the energetic residue of living the way she’d been living — absorbing everyone’s expectations, trying to optimize every minute, consuming content about wellness while having no actual well-being. By December 20th, something fundamental had shifted. She described it as “finally being able to hear myself think.” The compulsive phone checking slowed down. The 3 AM anxiety spirals stopped. She started saying no to things without the usual guilt spiral that followed.

By mid-January, she’d made a decision she’d been avoiding for a year — leaving her job. Not impulsively, but clearly. Not because the Reiki gave her answers, but because it cleared enough space for her to finally hear the answers she already had.

# Reiki: The Reset Your Nervous System Is Begging For

Here’s the truth about modern exhaustion: it’s not just mental. It’s not something you can think your way out of or productivity-hack your way through. It’s energetic.

Every time you doom-scroll, you’re not just wasting time — your energy field is absorbing whatever frequency that content carries. Every notification you respond to instantly is teaching your nervous system that you’re always available, always on call, never allowed to fully land in your own life. Every unconscious purchase you make is trying to fill an energetic void with a material solution that will never work. Every meeting you take while simultaneously checking email is fragmenting your energy across multiple spaces without giving it time to reconsolidate.

Your aura — the energetic field that surrounds your physical body — isn’t some abstract spiritual concept. It’s real, and it’s exhausted. It’s been working overtime trying to protect you from the constant bombardment of stimulation, information, and demands. And just like your physical body, when your energetic body is depleted, everything becomes harder. Focus becomes impossible. Decision-making feels overwhelming. You lose access to your intuition, your clarity, your sense of what you actually want.

Reiki healing works by clearing the accumulated debris from your energy field and reactivating your natural flow. During the 12:12 portal, this process is amplified — what might take weeks happens in days, what might take months happens in sessions. It’s not magic. It’s working with energy when the conditions are optimal for change.

For the person who’s been running on adrenaline and coffee, who can’t remember the last time they felt genuinely rested, who’s tried every productivity system and meditation app but still feels like they’re drowning — Reiki offers something different. Not another strategy to manage your depletion, but actual clearing of the depletion itself.

**Here’s what shifts when you clear your energy during the** [**12:12 window**](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb)**:**

**You reclaim your boundaries.** Not by forcing yourself to set them, but by naturally feeling where your energy ends and someone else’s begins. The woman who used to absorb everyone’s stress in her open-plan office suddenly found herself able to stay centered in chaos. The man who couldn’t scroll social media for work without falling down rabbit holes found himself able to engage intentionally and then walk away. Your energy becomes yours again, instead of being dispersed across everyone else’s needs.

**Your nervous system remembers what calm feels like.** We’ve been conditioned to live in a constant state of low-grade emergency. Every notification triggers a micro-stress response. Every unread email sits as background tension. Reiki recalibrates your nervous system back to its natural state — where you can focus on one thing without your brain screaming for the next hit of stimulation. Where patience doesn’t feel painful. Where you can sit with yourself without immediately reaching for a distraction. One client told me she cried the first time she sat at a coffee shop for an hour without touching her phone — not because it was hard, but because she’d forgotten that kind of peace was possible.

**You can finally hear yourself again.** When your energy is clear, your intuition isn’t buried under layers of noise. The goals you set aren’t about fixing what’s broken or proving something to someone. They’re about what you genuinely want to create. A tech founder I worked with realized that every goal she’d set for five years was designed to avoid failure. After her [12:12 clearing](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb), she started setting goals about what she wanted to experience, not what she was afraid of losing. That shift in frequency changed everything — her business grew, but more importantly, she stopped feeling like she was running from something.

The [**Reiki Energy Detox & Activation — 5 Day Healing Journey**](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb) is built specifically for this bridge period. Five consecutive days of clearing work that addresses different layers of depletion and rebuilds your energetic foundation. It’s designed for people who can’t take a week off, who are skeptical but desperate, who’ve tried everything else and are ready to try something that actually works with the root cause instead of just managing symptoms.

# The Bridge: Twenty Days to Rewrite Your Story

The space between December 12th and January 1st is sacred in a way most people overlook. This isn’t downtime. This is your integration period — when you actively work with the clearing you’ve initiated and start making different choices from a place of actual available energy.

Last year, someone completed their Reiki detox on December 16th. She didn’t wait until January to “start fresh.” Between December 17th and December 31st, she renegotiated her entire relationship with her phone — not through willpower, but because she suddenly had the energy to notice how much it was draining her. She stopped checking email first thing in the morning. She deleted Instagram from her phone for two weeks just to see what happened. She started her days with twenty minutes of silence instead of immediately plugging into everyone else’s agenda.

By January 1st, these weren’t resolutions she was forcing herself to keep. They were natural expressions of who she’d become. Six months later, she told me it was the first year in a decade where she didn’t abandon her goals by February. Not because she had more discipline, but because she wasn’t trying to change from a place of depletion anymore.

This is what the bridge period offers: time to practice being the person your clearing has made space for. Time to notice the patterns — the unconscious scrolling, the stress purchases, the depletion habits — and choose differently. Not through gritted teeth, but through genuine preference.

Another person I guided through this process — a consultant who’d been promoted three times in four years — described the twenty days as “finally feeling like a participant in my own life instead of a spectator.” The constant background anxiety that had become so normal she’d stopped noticing it was just… gone. She could think clearly. Make decisions without second-guessing herself into paralysis. By the time January arrived, she’d already restructured her workday, started a creative project she’d been pushing off for two years, and ended a relationship she’d known wasn’t right for eighteen months.

Not because Reiki gave her courage. Because it gave her back her energy, and with her energy came clarity she’d been too depleted to access.

# Your Year Starts Now, Not Later

Here’s what I want you to understand: January 1st is arbitrary. The universe doesn’t reset because we’ve printed new calendars. But December 12th? That’s a real energetic threshold. That’s when the conditions align for transformation that actually lasts.

You don’t have to wait until you’re completely broken down to do this work. You don’t have to hope that next year will magically be different while carrying the same exhausted energy forward. You don’t have to set another round of resolutions from a place of depletion and then feel like a failure when they don’t stick.

[The 12:12 portal is open](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb). The twenty-day bridge is waiting. Your 2026 is being written right now — not in the future, but in the energetic choices you make in these next few weeks.

What you clear in December determines what you create in January. What you activate on 12:12 determines how you show up for every single day that follows.

I know you’re tired. I know you’ve tried other things. I know there’s a part of you that’s skeptical, that doesn’t want to get your hopes up again. But I also know that if you’ve read this far, something in you recognizes the truth of what I’m saying. You’re ready. You’re just afraid that ready won’t be enough.

It will be. Not because transformation is easy, but because for once, you’ll be working with energy instead of against it. For once, you’ll be planting seeds in soil that’s been cleared and prepared. For once, you won’t be trying to willpower your way into change — you’ll be allowing the change that’s already waiting for you.

The [12:12 portal](https://app.coto.world/IZ42JzNHVYb) doesn’t wait. The bridge period doesn’t extend. If you miss this window, you’ll spend the first quarter of 2026 doing what you’ve done every other year — trying to force change from the same depleted place, wondering why it’s so hard, eventually giving up and promising yourself you’ll try again next year.

Or you can start now. Clear the energy now. Reclaim your boundaries now. Remember what it feels like to be genuinely present in your own life now.

Your best year doesn’t start on January 1st when you make promises you’re too tired to keep. It starts on December 12th when you finally give yourself permission to clear the exhaustion and step into the energy you’ve always had but couldn’t access.

The portal is open. Your energy is ready. The only question is whether you’ll walk through.

1ph9wza,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCD/comments/1ph9wza/my_ocd_made_me_laugh/,My OCD made me laugh,"I've been working at my workplace for 1,5 years. There have been multiple times I've convinced myself that my colleagues hate me and they are having meetings about me, where they talk about how much I suck at my job and as a person. In the first couple of months that I started here, I convinced myself that one of my colleagues hates me because one time I catched him looking at his watch when I arrived late. After this, every meeting he was having with my boss was obviously to talk about how much he dislikes me and wants me fired. It's insane, I know.

I was diagnosed with OCD a few months ago and have been doing ERP ever since. It's been a tough thing to process, but now I'm starting to catch some of these thoughts as they come. And by catching them, I mean that I'm seeing them as just thoughts and not something I have to go over for hours looking for evidence why the thought isn't true. I've also realised that I have a constant fear of getting fired at any minute, and these thoughts make me go over all of the ""reasons"" I could get fired, and all of the ""proof"" that I'm actually not getting fired. It's an exhausting endless cycle that I'm now working on.

This morning I was getting coffee from the coffee machine and I saw my boss drinking coffee with a few of my colleagues at a table near by. These people are my colleagues but they don't work on the same team as I do. As soon as I see them, I hear in my head ""they are talking about you"". Six months ago this would have sent me to a spiral where I would have to go over everything I might have done to upset these people, have I made any mistakes lately, have there been any weird looks, etc.

This time? I started to laugh. I recognised it as a silly thought that has no value. It was clickbait and I wasn't interested. I walked back to my desk feeling so happy over this small win in the long ongoing battle.

1ph9tcg,https://youtu.be/09cS9vYcfPM,4 Very Scary TRUE Remote Cabin Horror Stories,"# ""The Snowfall"":

Coming home from work that evening, tired but already picturing a warm dinner with the family, the cottage felt unusually still. Snow pressed against the windows, muffling every sound, but the silence inside held something colder. Stepping into the kitchen, the sight stopped everything inside me.

A man stood beside the table, an axe from our shed in his hands, its blade resting lightly against his leg. My parents sat rigid in their chairs, and our ten-year-old daughter stared wide-eyed, too afraid to speak. The man’s eyes were flat, like he was already somewhere far away from humanity.

“Evening,” he said, voice calm in a way that didn’t match his grip on the axe. “Name’s Billy. Broke out of prison. I need a place to hide. Do as I say, and nobody gets hurt.”

Terror rose like a tide, but I forced myself steady for Sarah. “Okay,” I whispered. “We won’t cause trouble.”

He made us sit and wait in the cold tension of the kitchen until my husband came home. The moment he stepped through the door, Billy grabbed me, pressing a knife to my throat so tight I could feel the pulse in my neck thumping against the blade.

“Tie them up,” he ordered, shoving cords at my husband. “Do it right.”

He tried to whisper comfort—“It’ll be okay”—but the tremble in his voice said he wasn’t sure.

That night we were separated and tied in different rooms, each door shut like a lid over a coffin. Thumps sounded from my father’s room—heavy, sickening. A cry. I begged through the door, “Please, stop!” but the man only laughed, telling me to be quiet or suffer worse.

The next morning, workers came to look at the septic tank. Billy stood behind me with the knife hidden against my spine. “Smile,” he murmured. “Send them away.” My voice shook, but they left, unaware of the nightmare behind the door.

He later forced me to drive to town for newspapers and cigarettes. “No cops,” he warned. “I still have your family.” Every instinct screamed at me to run, to scream for help, but fear for Sarah locked my voice down. I drove back, praying she was still alive.

He played cards with us that night as though nothing was happening. The forced small talk, his sudden laughs, the way his eyes drifted to the hallway—it all felt surreal. “Where’s Sarah?” I kept asking. “She’s sleeping,” he said each time, but something in his tone chilled me deeper than the snowstorm outside.

By the third day he was pacing restlessly, muttering about needing money, about running before the roads closed. He sent my husband and me into town for supplies. At a red light, my husband whispered, “We could tell the cop.” I shook my head. “If he finds out, he’ll kill them.”

Back home, he tied my husband again and dragged me into the car, saying we were leaving. But halfway down the road, he turned around. I felt dread crawl up my throat.

As he pulled back into the driveway, screams erupted from inside the cottage. My mother. My husband. I cried out from the passenger seat, but he shoved me back, locking the door. Neighbors heard, rushed over, and called the police.

Inside, my father and daughter had already been killed the first night—something he had hidden behind that cold smile. My husband and mother died trying to fight back. The cottage, once warm and familiar, was now soaked in loss.

Billy fled, crashed the car, stole another, and dragged me with him until police boxed us in. In the final standoff he lifted the axe over me. “Your time’s up!” he shouted. Shots broke the air, and he fell before he could strike.

I survived. The house did not. Every shadow in that cottage still carries the echo of those days, a reminder that evil can slip quietly into the warmest homes and tear everything apart in an instant.

Coming home from work that evening felt like stepping into a painting made of winter. Snow blanketed the fields around the cottage in Eastmoor, softening the world into quiet drifts of white. The porch light glowed faintly through the falling flakes, warm and familiar. My boots crunched on the frozen steps, and as I reached for the door, I remember thinking how good it would feel to sink into the warmth of home and see my family gathered inside.

But the moment the door clicked shut behind me, the air felt wrong.

Not silent—*held*. Like the house itself was holding its breath.

Coats hung neatly on their hooks. The fire crackled in the living room. Everything looked normal, but a strange heaviness pressed down on me. I stepped into the kitchen—and stopped.

A man I had never seen before stood beside the table, gripping an axe from our own shed. The blade was nicked and speckled with dirt; the handle looked almost too small in his hand. My parents sat stiffly across from him, faces pale, eyes darting to mine in terrified warning. And our daughter sat at the end of the table, legs trembling, her ten-year-old fingers clamped around the arms of her chair.

The man turned, his expression unnervingly calm.

“Evenin’,” he said. His voice had that flat, almost conversational tone that made my stomach twist. “Name’s Billy. Broke outta prison today. Need a place to stay. Do exactly what I say, and nobody gets hurt.”

I could hardly breathe, but I nodded—anything to keep my daughter safe. “Okay,” I managed. “We won’t cause trouble.”

He made us sit in tense silence, listening to the wind groan outside, until my husband came home an hour later. The moment he stepped inside, Billy lunged, grabbing me by the arm and yanking me upright. A knife flashed from his pocket, the cold edge pressed to my throat.

“Tie them up,” he ordered, shoving cords at my husband. “All of ’em. Tight.”

My husband’s hands shook as he obeyed. He tried to whisper reassurance, his voice cracking. “It’ll be okay… just stay calm.”

That night, we were dragged into separate rooms. Each one felt like a dark box, walls closing in. I heard shouts from my father’s room—sharp impacts, then a choked cry. My mother sobbed somewhere behind a closed door. Sarah’s voice, small and terrified, echoed down the hall until Billy shouted at her to shut up.

I begged through the wood grain of my door, “Please, please stop!” but all I heard was his low, humorless laugh.

The next morning brought no relief. Workers came unexpectedly to check the septic tank. Billy stood behind me with the knife pressed into my back, lips brushing my ear as he hissed, “Smile. Send them away. Make one wrong move and your little girl dies first.”

My hands shook visibly, but the workers never noticed. They left with a friendly wave, unaware of how close they’d been to five terrified hostages.

Later, he pushed a list into my hands. Newspapers. Cigarettes. Matches. “Drive into town. Don’t talk to a soul beyond buying these. I’ll know if you try something. I still have your family.”

As I drove away, the radio crackled with weather warnings—roads icing, snow thickening. Every instinct inside me screamed to run to the police, to throw myself into someone’s arms, to beg for help. But every time I imagined opening my mouth, I saw Sarah’s frightened little face.

So I bought what he asked for and drove back, heart in my throat the entire way.

When I returned, he acted almost cheerful—restless, pacing, manic. He made us sit at the table and play cards as if we were guests at some bizarre dinner party. The fire popped loudly in the silence. My mother’s eyes were red from crying. My husband stared at the wall instead of his cards.

“Where’s Sarah?” I finally asked, voice trembling.

“Sleeping,” he said, dealing another hand. “Kids sleep a lot.”

But the flicker in his eyes… it wasn’t right.

By the third day, a storm had sealed the cottage under heavy snow. Billy stalked from window to window, muttering about money, about needing a car, about being trapped. His hands shook now—not from fear, but agitation. The air felt electrically charged, danger coiling tighter every hour.

That afternoon he shoved us toward the door.

“You two—come with me. We need supplies.” He pointed at my husband and me. “The rest stay. No funny business.”

At a stoplight in town, my husband whispered, “We should tell the cop… he’s right there.” I saw the officer parked across the street, saw safety just steps away.

But all I could picture was Sarah’s face.

I shook my head. “He’ll kill them. We can’t.”

When we returned, Billy retied my husband and dragged me back outside. “We’re leaving,” he said, fumbling with the keys. Snow hammered the windshield. But halfway down the road, he suddenly turned back.

“No,” he muttered. “No loose ends.”

As we pulled into the driveway, I heard the first scream—my mother’s, high and desperate. Then my husband’s voice, shouting, struggling, begging. The back door slammed. A crash. Then silence.

I screamed from inside the car, pounding on the windows, but he kept them locked. Neighbors heard the chaos and ran toward the house, calling the police as they arrived at the porch.

By the time officers entered, my father and daughter had already been murdered—killed the very first night, something he had kept hidden behind his calm voice and forced smiles. My mother and husband died trying to fight him off in those last moments.

Billy fled with me in the car, crashing into a ditch a mile down the icy road, then stealing another vehicle. Sirens echoed through the snowstorm as he drove recklessly, dragging me with him in a last, frantic attempt to escape.

The final confrontation happened in a blinding flurry of lights and snowfall. Police boxed us in near the edge of the woods. He grabbed the axe from the backseat, dragging me out with it pressed against my neck.

“Your time’s up!” he shouted, raising it high.

A single officer lunged in, gunshots cracking through the icy air. Billy dropped. The axe slipped from his hands. He fell into the snow, and everything finally went still.

I survived. My family did not.

Now the cottage stands quiet and hollow, wrapped in winter year-round in my memory. Every creak of floorboards, every shifting shadow holds the echo of those days. Sometimes, when the house settles at night, it feels like the moment right before I opened the door that evening—when everything was still normal, and I didn’t yet know how quickly evil can slip inside and take everything you love.





# ""Tracks"":

I’d always loved escaping the city whenever life started feeling too loud, so when summer rolled around, my friend Dave and I figured it was the perfect time to vanish into the Utah mountains for a while. We found this old cabin listed online—one of those places that barely shows up on a map, tucked miles down dirt roads that twist through pines and open meadows. The listing promised “absolute solitude,” which sounded perfect. No traffic, no phones buzzing, no responsibilities knocking at the door.

The drive took most of the day. By the time we turned off the last paved road, the sun was dipping low, painting the sky in dusty orange streaks. We bounced along rough tracks, our truck rattling as we climbed higher into the mountains. When the cabin finally came into view, it looked exactly like the photos: hand-built wooden walls weathered gray by sun and rain, a tiny porch, a stone chimney rising crookedly on one side. It looked lonely in a way that felt peaceful—until that first moment I stepped up onto the porch.

The key was under the mat just like the owner said. But when I pushed the door open, something in my gut tightened. The latch didn’t catch properly, like it hadn’t been closed all the way. The faint smell of cold air and old smoke drifted out. I paused in the doorway.

“Hey, Dave… you think animals got in?” I asked.

He hauled his duffel inside and shrugged. “Probably just the wind. These places shift all the time.” But even he sounded unsure.

We walked through the tiny place—two small bedrooms with creaky metal bunks, a kitchen with dated appliances, a bathroom barely big enough to turn around in. Everything looked normal until I opened a cupboard looking for a pot. A few cans of food sat behind the plates—ones we definitely didn’t bring. One of them was half-eaten, a jagged metal edge where someone had pried it open.

“Weird,” I murmured.

Dave leaned over my shoulder. “Last renters probably forgot it.” He tried to brush it off. “Come on, man. I’m starving—let’s just eat something real.”

We threw together some sandwiches and ate quickly, then grabbed our gear and walked down to the stream to fish before the light disappeared. The water was clear and icy, rushing over smooth stones. We caught a couple trout, joked around, pretended nothing felt strange.

But by evening, when we returned and built a fire inside the cabin, the woods around us were unnervingly still. We played cards at the little table, laughing at first. But every so often, my ears would tune into the silence outside—too quiet, like the forest was holding its breath.

When we finally turned in, I lay awake longer than I cared to admit, listening to every creak of the floors, every gust of wind pressing against the walls. I must’ve drifted off, because the next thing I remember was waking abruptly to a faint thump outside.

A single, heavy step.

I held my breath. There it was again—a slow, deliberate crunch of dirt.

“Dave?” I whispered.

“Yeah?” His voice sounded groggy.

“You hear that?”

He paused. “…Probably a deer. Go back to sleep.”

But it didn’t feel like a deer. It felt like a person. Close.

Morning came with gray light filtering through the curtains and the smell of strong coffee. Dave cooked eggs while I stepped out onto the porch to clear my head. That’s when I saw it: a boot print in the soft dirt, deep, crisp, unmistakably fresh. Bigger than either of ours. It pointed right toward the porch.

A cold shiver crawled up my back.

“Dave,” I called. “Get over here.”

He joined me, crouched down, studied it. His jaw tightened. “Maybe the owner stopped by?”

“Without a truck? Or saying anything?”

We didn’t find anything else around the cabin, but the unease stuck. We hiked the trail behind the cabin to try to reset our minds. About a mile in, we found a clearing hidden behind thick brush. There was trash scattered in a small, makeshift nest—food wrappers, scraps of clothing, a rusty can opener. Some of the wrappers matched the brand of the half-empty can in our cupboard.

“Dave… someone’s living out here,” I said.

He kicked lightly at the mess. “Looks fresh. Poacher, drifter… whoever it is, I don’t wanna run into them.”

The woods didn’t feel peaceful anymore. The trees felt tighter, the shadows heavier. We fished again that afternoon, but my eyes kept drifting toward the treeline, waiting for movement.

By dinner we’d grilled trout over a small fire pit, trying to keep things normal. Dave cracked a joke—“Maybe Bigfoot left that footprint.” But even he didn’t smile after it left his mouth.

We locked the door that night even though the latch barely held. The fire crackled softly as darkness swallowed the windows. The quiet pressed in, thicker than before.

Then—just after ten—something scraped along the wooden wall outside. A slow drag. Like fingertips. I froze. Dave looked up sharply.

A shadow crossed the window.

Tall, human-shaped. Gone as fast as it appeared.

“Dave,” I whispered, standing. “There’s someone out there.”

“Flashlight,” he said, voice tight.

I grabbed it, hands shaking, and shined it through the glass. Only trees stared back. We killed the lights inside so we could see better. The night outside was endless and pitch-black.

Then a whistle broke the silence. Low. Deliberate. Not an animal.

“Who the hell is that?” Dave muttered.

Footsteps circled the cabin—slow, testing, crunching the leaves. They stopped by the back door. The handle jiggled, metal tapping metal.

My heart slammed into my ribs.

“HEY!” I shouted, pounding the wall. “We see you! Get out of here!”

Everything went dead quiet. Then footsteps retreating, fading into the woods.

“We’re leaving at first light,” Dave said, pale. “I don’t care if we lose the deposit.”

Sleep wasn’t an option. I sat in the chair facing the door, a kitchen knife balanced across my lap, listening to the fire burn low.

Around three in the morning, a new sound started—scratching. Not outside. Beneath us.

The crawl space.

“Dave,” I hissed. “Wake up. Under the floor.”

He listened. The scratching grew louder—something bigger than an animal shifting around underneath the cabin.

“We stomp,” he whispered.

We both slammed our heels into the wooden boards. The noise stopped instantly.

We didn’t hear anything else, but the knowledge was worse: whoever had been out there knew the cabin, knew the crawl space, knew the layout. And he hadn’t left for good.

At first light, we threw our gear in the truck without talking. I felt eyes on us the entire time. Before I got into the passenger seat, a flicker of movement in the trees caught my eye—a glint, faint but unmistakable.

Binoculars.

“Dave. Go. Now.”

He hit the gas, and we tore down the dirt road, dust spraying behind us. A few miles later, we came across a sheriff’s truck heading up the same road. We waved him down and told him everything—footprints, noises, trash, someone trying the door.

The sheriff didn’t look surprised.

“You boys staying in the Iron County rentals?” he asked. We nodded. He sighed. “We’ve been tracking a guy out here for years. Calls himself a mountain man. Breaks into cabins, steals food, watches people. He’s dangerous. Armed most times. You’re lucky he didn’t push his way inside.”

We drove away shaking, the air finally feeling safe again now that civilization was in sight.

Later that week, I read about him—Troy James Knapp. A survivalist ghost in the Utah mountains. Wanted for burglaries, property damage, and armed confrontations. They caught him not long after our trip during a snow-covered standoff.

But knowing he’d been out there that night—circling our cabin, testing the doors, crawling underneath the floor—still puts ice in my veins.

We weren’t alone. Not even close.

And if we’d stayed one more night, I’m not sure we would’ve left at all.





# ""Hidden Away"":

I woke to a loud bang that shook the entire house. It was late—too late—and I was only thirteen, still half-asleep, tangled in my blankets. Molly, my dog, barked like a maniac from downstairs, her growls echoing through the dark hallways. My chest tightened as I listened. Then came more noises: a voice shouting outside, rough and angry, cutting through the night.

My dad went to the door, flashlight in hand, the beam cutting a thin line through the darkness. ""Show me your badge,"" he called, steady but tense. Silence answered him. Another bang followed, louder this time, rattling the windows and sending dust motes dancing in the flashlight’s glow.

Fear pinched at me, and I scrambled out of bed, feet cold on the floor, and ran to my parents’ room. My mom was already awake, her eyes wide and frantic. ""Come here, sweetie,"" she whispered, pulling me close. We huddled in the bathroom and locked the door. Her fingers trembled as she dialed 911. ""Someone’s trying to get in,"" she murmured into the phone. My heart pounded so loudly I thought it would drown out her voice.

The banging grew worse, now the front door splintering under repeated blows. The man shouted, furious. My dad yelled back, ""What do you want?"" A gunshot cracked the air. I gasped, clinging to my mom. She hugged me tighter. ""It’s okay, Jayme. Stay quiet."" But it wasn’t okay.

Heavy footsteps pounded up the stairs. They were inside. My mom pressed her finger to her lips, but I was trembling so hard I could barely breathe. The man went from room to room, doors creaking open, checking. When he reached ours, he rattled the handle. ""Open up,"" he growled. Silence. Then he kicked the door. Hard. Over and over, until it finally burst open.

He stood there—a stranger, masked, gun in hand. My mom stepped in front of me. ""Please, don’t hurt us. Take what you want and go."" He said nothing, just pointed the gun. Then he pulled black tape from his pocket, binding my wrists so tightly I cried out, and then my ankles. ""Mom..."" I whimpered. She tried to push him back, but he fired. My mom fell, blood pooling beneath her.

He dragged me down the stairs, my bare feet smashing against each step. My dad lay near the door, unmoving. Outside, the trunk of his car yawned open. He shoved me inside, the cold metal pressing against me as the engine rumbled. Sirens wailed in the distance, fading as he sped away. My wrists burned, fear twisted into knots in my stomach, and I wondered if anyone would ever find me.

Eventually, the car stopped. He pulled me out into a forest of darkness—trees looming like silent sentries, a single cabin hidden among them. ""This is your new home,"" he said flatly, cutting the tape from my ankles but keeping my hands bound. Inside, the cabin smelled of mildew and neglect. He handed me oversized pajamas, which I wore because I had no choice. ""Try to run, and bad things will happen,"" he warned. ""No one will hear you out here.""

That first night, I lay on the bed he pointed to, wide awake, every creak of the cabin magnified in the dark. He slept in the same room, snoring lightly, and every shadow felt like it might leap at me. I thought of my parents, their smiles, their voices—now silenced by him. Tears soaked the pillow, but I stayed silent, afraid even of sound.

Days blurred. Sometimes he left for errands, other times not at all. When he did leave, he pushed me under his bed, stacking boxes and weights around me. ""Don’t move,"" he warned. Hours crawled by as I squirmed in the darkness, desperate to pee, desperate to breathe. Outside, birds chirped, cars passed, and no one came.

He made me help with chores, cooking meals under his watchful eye. ""Chop these,"" he’d order, knife in hand, eyes cold and empty. Once, I asked why he’d taken me. He paused, fork midair. ""I saw you on the school bus one day. I knew I wanted you."" I felt a chill crawl down my spine.

Holidays passed in silence. At Christmas, he left, stacking boxes heavier than before. I lay under the bed, the wind rattling the trees outside, wondering if anyone knew I was alive. Every noise made me jump—creaking floorboards, animals in the woods, even the shadows themselves.

He let me outside once or twice, but gripped my arm tight. ""If anyone sees you, I’ll kill them too,"" he whispered. I believed him. Fear grew slowly, like water filling a bottle. Every day I wondered if today would be the day he snapped, if I’d ever see my family again.

Then, one January day, he left. ""Under the bed,"" he said, stacking weights. His engine faded. My chest tightened—not with fear this time, but a spark of hope. I pushed the boxes, inch by inch, sweat beading my forehead. Pain burned in my arms, but finally, a gap. I slipped out, trembling, heart pounding, legs wobbling.

The cabin was empty. I grabbed his sneakers by the door and ran into the cold night, the woods clawing at my skin. Branches tore at my face, leaves slick beneath my feet. I stumbled onto a road. A woman walking her dog froze, eyes wide. ""Are you Jayme?"" she asked. I nodded, tears streaming. ""He took me. Please help.""

She wrapped me in her coat, led me to her neighbor’s house, and called the police. I whispered Jake’s name, told them about my parents. Minutes later, sirens, flashing lights. He was caught nearby, driving, silent, admitting it all.

Now I live with my aunt. Loud noises still make me jump, but I’m stronger. That cabin tried to break me—but I survived. The memories replay in dreams, but I know one truth: even in the darkest places, help can find you.





# ""The Night Evil"":

We lived in a small wooden house out in the countryside near Okarche, Oklahoma. It stood alone on a wide stretch of land, surrounded by fields that rippled in the wind, with no neighbors close enough to hear a thing. My dad was the town’s pastor—kind, patient, always helping people. My mom ran the house, taking care of me and my older brother Brooks, who was sixteen. Life was simple, steady. School, chores, family dinners—normal, safe, predictable.

That evening, October 15, 1979, started just like any other. Mom made fried chicken and mashed potatoes, the aroma filling the kitchen and drifting into the living room. We gathered at the table, laughing and talking about school. Dad asked Brooks, “How was football practice today?” Brooks smiled, pride in his voice, “Good. Coach says I’m getting faster.” I nudged my plate, “I drew something in art class today. Want to see it?” Mom smiled, “After dinner, sweetie.” The clatter of silverware and the warmth of the lamp above us made everything feel ordinary, safe.

Then came a knock at the door. Hard. Sharp. My stomach sank. Dad got up, his brow furrowed, and peered through the window. Two men stood there—one tall, dark-haired, the other shorter with a scruffy beard. The tall one held a shotgun; the short one had a pistol.

“This is a robbery,” the tall man barked, shoving the door open. “Everyone on the floor! Face down!”

Dad raised his hands, calm but tense. “Please… take what you want, but don’t hurt my family.”

“Shut up and do what we say,” the short one snapped, pressing the pistol against his side.

We scrambled onto the living room rug. The tall one produced rope and bound our hands and feet, cold efficiency in his movements. “Where’s the money?” he demanded. Dad pointed to a kitchen drawer. The short one rifled through it, returning with a handful of bills.

“That’s all?” the tall man sneered. “You’re lying.”

Mom whispered, voice trembling, “That’s everything. I promise.”

The men tore through the house, overturning drawers and cabinets, throwing belongings across the floor. Fear settled over me like a thick blanket. Then the tall man’s eyes locked on mine.

“You. Come with me,” he said.

He yanked me up roughly, and I looked to Dad, panic-stricken. “No! Please! Leave her alone!”

The short one leveled the pistol at him. “Quiet, or I’ll shoot now.”

He dragged me to the back bedroom. I don’t want to recount everything that happened there—it was dark, brutal. I cried quietly, wishing desperately that Mom and Dad were safe.

When it was over, he tied my feet again and returned me to the living room. The men sat at our table, eating the leftover chicken as if nothing had happened. “This is good,” the short one said, crunching a drumstick. The tall one laughed. “Better than jail food.”

Their conversation turned to leaving town, their voices tense. “We can’t leave witnesses,” the tall one whispered. “Do it then,” the short one replied.

I froze as the tall one raised the pistol. “Sorry about this,” he said, cold and emotionless.

Bang. Dad fell, a crimson splash on the floor.

Mom screamed, “Richard!”

Bang. She crumpled next.

Brooks groaned, shot twice in the back. I felt searing pain, two gunshots ripping through me. I lay still, blood in my mouth, wishing the world would just stop.

Then silence.

Brooks whispered hoarsely, “Leslie… you okay?”

I whispered back, “It hurts.”

Dad managed a faint, “Kids… love you,” before going still.

Somehow, through sheer will, Brooks wriggled his hands free, using his teeth to loosen the ropes. He untied me. “We have to get help,” he said. We crawled to Dad, whispered our love one last time.

Staggering to our feet, bloodied and trembling, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen to cut the final ropes. Brooks got behind the wheel of our car, ignoring the pain in his own body. “Hold on, Leslie,” he said, gripping the wheel tight. We drove through the night to a friend’s house. The door swung open, their eyes wide in shock. “Call the ambulance!” someone shouted.

At the hospital, doctors worked to save us. Police arrived, asking questions. I described the men—the tall one with dark hair, the short one with a beard. Brooks mentioned the yellow car outside. “Chevy Malibu,” he said.

The men were caught quickly. Witnesses had seen that car at another robbery. Their trail led to an oil field where they worked. Their names: Glen Ake and Steven Hatch. They had fled, committing more crimes in Texas and Colorado, killing two more people. In Colorado, a hostage tricked them into drinking spiked beer, escaped, and called the police. Six weeks later, the men were finally apprehended.

They confessed. Glen admitted to the shootings; Steven aided him. Both had been drunk and on drugs. Sentences shifted over the years: Glen eventually died in prison in 2011, Steven as well after his sentence was changed.

Brooks and I grew up. He became a lawyer, eventually a senator, working to protect victims and even confronting Glen in prison years later, finding forgiveness to heal himself. I became a teacher, built a family, and kept going.

We never forgot. That night taught me that evil exists—and so does the strength to survive it. Our home once felt safe. Now I know that danger can come without warning. But family, courage, and love… they endure. Always.",1,1765192389.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I genuinely can’t tell anymore.,"I’ve been with my partner for several years now, and his family has been… a journey. At first, I genuinely tried. I really did. I moved to their area, made the effort, visited on my own when my partner was working shifts, called, texted, offered help, babysat, went to family events, the lot.

And then out of nowhere, MIL just stopped answering me. Calls? Ignored. Texts? Left on read. Invites I suggested? She’d avoid committing. After months of me trying, I just quietly stopped. I got the message loud and clear.

But weirdly, she still wants me around, but only when it benefits her or helps her get what she wants from her son. She will not contact me for weeks, even months… until she wants him to come around. Then suddenly I’m “love” and “hun” and “miss you all xx” and invited around her house like I’m some emotional courier pigeon.

And if her son doesn’t jump to command?

She goes straight through me to try to get him to do it.

She’s also accidentally texted me using his ex’s name — after we’ve been together YEARS. I corrected her once and she brushed it off. Never apologised. Just awkwardly pretended it didn’t happen.

The whole family runs on this bizarre dynamic where they expect instant effort, instant attention, instant babysitting, but put in zero effort back. His sister only ever messages me when she needs something, usually to check her brother’s work rota so she can plan around him. They never ask how I am, never invite me anywhere unless it suits them, and act shocked when I don’t drop everything.

But the part that gets me the most…

Every so often, they all collectively explode because we “don’t see them enough”. Full blown dramatic meltdowns. I’m talking guilt trips, emotional spirals, and even family interventions over us not visiting several times a week. We live in the same town , nothing is stopping them popping over , yet they never do. It’s always on us, specifically me, to do all the running.

MIL says things like:

“You’ve both changed.”

“We don’t see you enough.”

""You need to see the kids more"" - her grandkids.

“We never know what’s going on with you.”

""Why don't you come for tea more?""

And the classic guilt-trip lines like “I miss you all so much xxxx.”

But the second I ask something neutral like, “When’s good for you?” she’ll immediately shift the goalposts or say something like:

“Let’s all do lunch — you two come to us xx.”

Translation: Only their terms count.

Anytime I take something at face value or show interest, they backtrack. Like the auntie joking about us being the only ones without a Christmas party — I suggested going for a curry and she basically shut me down with “Oh, I was joking.” I felt stupid.

They also ask us to take days off, rearrange things, and do favours around their schedules, not ours. Example: a huge item delivered that I had to be home for because MIL picked the date without checking whether anyone was available. And now they want it assembled THIS weekend — again without asking.

And don’t even get me started on the niece’s godparent fiasco. They made a huge show of asking my partner to be godparent in front of everyone… after specifically telling me in advance that I wouldn’t be asked. They had multiple godparents already, so it wasn’t even about numbers. It felt like a pointed exclusion. Then months later they tried to spin it like it was a “special surprise birthday gift” for me. (What?! Who gives godparent duties as a birthday present? On my 30th. When my dad met his parents for the first time. I just felt the had to make it about them, even my step mum looked confused).

All of this has built up over years, the emotional inconsistency, fake niceness when they want something, the ignoring when they don't, the subtle digs, the pressure, the guilt, the expectations of babysitting, the interventions, the family drama waves, the weird competition vibes, the moments where they suddenly “love me” when they need access to him. Mil is very transactional, when we first moved here my partner gave her a key. She was lovely , warm welcoming, would come in and hoover for us or leave us tea sometimes , feed our cat. But then it got crazy. She decided to rearrange my garden pots, put my cushions in a certain way, question me every time I'd put my things back the way I or we liked it. And one time took back gifts she'd given us, because her daughter and grandchild needed them. A parasole and a garden table. There was absolutely no reason for it. That was the final straw. I told my partner if that woman takes anything from my house again so help me god I will go in and take it back and the police will be involved. On top of this , recently the sil randomly starts contacting me about camping advice. We don't have a lot of camping stuff but we have a good basic setup as we've gone camping a lot over the years. My mother-in-law has never ever given me anything to do with camping. And even if she did it would still be our items I'm not obliged to share. I thought it was odd that my sister-in-law decided that she would pop in for a coffee one day. I was delighted and welcomed her with open arms as nobody ever visits us or pays any interest in our lives. It Became aparent quite quickly she was only there to try and land some camping equipment. She even said mummy said she gave you and her son a lot of camping equipment and we want to take the kids camping so can we use it? My face literally dropped and I said no your mother has never given me anything for camping. She even challenged me and I said no. She even asked if she could borrow the tent that I told her I had gone halfway with my own mum who comes with us some times. I'm a nice person so I said yes I don't mind you borrowing the tent before you invest in one yourself to see if you like camping but your mum did not give it to us. All of the stuff we have we own.

I told my partner when he came home from work and he was livid that I had said that she could borrow the tent. He called her up straight away and said no you are not using our tent. Buy your own.

Anyway.

And now I honestly can’t tell if:

I’m overthinking everything, I’m finally seeing them clearly, or They’re genuinely unhinged.

Because every interaction feels like a performance. Nothing feels warm or real. It’s like they only want me around when it benefits them or keeps their son tied into the family routines.

I don’t even know what I want from them anymore , a normal relationship would be great, but I’m starting to accept that’s never going to happen

So… am I nitpicking, or is this all as bonkers as it feels?

1ph9lin,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1ph9lin/its_not_her/,It’s Not Her,"   I’m currently three days into a drunken bender. Drinking myself stupid while playing PlayStation or watching YouTube on the couch. Anything to stay numb and distracted from my life for just a few more days. The tv illuminates my dark and musty living room. My beloved couch, riddled with stains from drinks and food grease, has also been serving as my bed. While in the middle of a game my vision blurred as I briefly went cross eyed and began vomiting all over the coffee table in front of me. I stared into the foamy yellow puddle, my mind trying its hardest to still the spinning room. “I gotta get some water in me” I said through a slurred mumble. I sat up from the couch and stumbled my way to the kitchen walking as if the individual tiles on the floor were trying to slide out from under my feet. I grabbed an old half finished water bottle off the counter and began opening it when there was a sudden knock at the door.

   “JESUS”! I yelled as I wobbled in place. I turned and stared at the door for a minute before shakily calling out. “Hello”? I paused for a moment before glancing over to the clock by the tv that read 3:43am. I stepped closer to the door. “Who’s there”?.. There was no reply and I’m sure as hell not about to open it. Even drunk I’ve seen way too many movies to make that mistake. After a minute of silence I shrugged and turned back towards the kitchen. Three more knocks came even louder than the last. I flinched and dropped my water to the ground splashing my feet. “Ah come on man, hey!! Who is it that? Who’s there”?

   There are two windows on either side of my front door but they’re the type of frosted glass that’s made to where you can’t see through. It’s only now that I’ve noticed how damn pointless they are. “Juss keep on movin, buddy! I’ve got a gun so take your pranks elsewhere” I said knowing full damn well the only weapon in this place is a fat glass lamp.

   It’s been eerily quiet for a few minutes now other than a faint scratching sound that happened so softly I wasn’t sure if I was actually hearing it at all. I let out a short frustrated breath and started to step back. Half way into the step I heard a woman’s voice at the door. “James? James, honey”? All at once the world fell from under me. My eyes shifted back to the door and I could see a silhouette in the window. I tried to deny it but I could never mistake that voice. The voice of my mother.. who we had buried four days ago.

   “James.. James open the door. It’s cold out here”. A wave of goosebumps formed all over my body and my breath grew quick and panicked as if I had fallen into ice. The silhouette certainly resembled her but it was twitching in short frequent bursts. And the head.. It seemed as if it were stretching out in different areas. A hand slapped against the glass and I fell backwards scrambling to get back up. I ran upstairs as quickly as I could while the entire house exploded with deafening bangs against the door that quickly spread to the walls and windows.

   I slammed the door to my room shut and simultaneously the house fell silent. I slumped down with my back against the door, my heart beating out of my chest, my mind trying to form one coherent thought. I fumbled for my phone and called my sister. “.. Hello”? I heard through a rough yawn. “ALEXIS” I yelled. “It’s mom or or I think it’s- it’s not- I mean it can’t be but“ Alexis interrupted: “Mom? What are you talking about James? Are you drunk again? This isn’t fucking funny”.

   “Alexis please just listen to me! There’s someone, someTHING, outside my house and.. and it’s trying to get in”! There was a long pause on the other line that slowly filled with a faint static. “Shes coming in, James”.

   “I… what”? I slowly pulled the phone from my ear. “Lex…”? On the phone I could hear distant labored breathing accompanied by the sound of a doorknob turning.

   As the sound of a door opening creaked through the phone I could also hear the front door from downstairs. I dropped the phone and began barricading my bedroom door. A large chair, my dresser, the damn lamp! Anything that could possibly add more security between me and whatever was now walking up the stairs. “James, dear. Where arrrrrrrre youuuuuu”? Creaks from the stairs filled whatever silence wasn’t occupied by my mother’s voice. My legs buckled as I backed away and my shorts grew warmer and wet. Like a frightened child with zero sense I jumped into my bed, all rational thought left behind as I wrapped myself in the sheets.

   I’ve always wondered how I would face a fight or flight, near death experience. In my head I had always painted myself as the hero or survivor. Calm, brave, knowing exactly how to handle the situation. But now I know. I’ve been plunged into an indescribable, primal fear and am now cowering in my bed waiting for certain death. I stare at the door listening to it walk by taunting me with the voice of who I cherished most in this world. What made it worse was how happy and comforting it seemed.

   A shadow stops in front of my room and the handle gently turns but fails to open. Three small knocks echo in the room. “Open the door James”. A harsh thud slams into the door making the hinges squeal and the barricade shake. The voice called out again never changing its cheerful motherly tone. “Let me in, James! I need to get in, I need to get in, I need to get in, I need to get in”! It repeated itself endlessly as the knocking and ramming grew more and more intense. It rattled my head so much I vomited again in to the sheets I had cocooned myself in. I threw the sheets over my head and shook in the fetal position until the room was once again silent.

   I peeked out half expecting to see whatever it was standing in the doorway but there was nothing. The shadow was gone and the barricade still intact, the only sound being my quiet but panicked breaths. I swallowed what little spit I had in my dry mouth, my eyes unable to blink or leave the door until something caught their attention. In my peripherals I spotted the crack in my closet door grow wider.

   Once more I ducked back under the sheets my whole body clinched and vibrating with sweat. The bed’s surface shifted as a new weight was added to the mattress. A horrific and yet somehow calming sense of numbness took over as I felt a  cold hand perch itself on my shoulder. “There you are”.",2,1765191621.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

   Possession can take many forms. Thanks to Hollywood Humans have a pretty good grasp on the basics. It primarily involves a person, animal or object. In many cases it’s easiest to possess whatever is near or the focal point of negativity. The abused and neglected child desperate and vulnerable, the home that has housed decades of family trauma and violence or the doll that is simply a witness to it all. For a Demon it’s far more than just a chance to torment and drag an unlucky soul back into the fires. It’s an opportunity. A chance to prove to all of Hell what you can do while also being able to escape it for as long as you can. The closest thing we have to a miracle.

  I’d introduce myself but my name is unpronounceable by man and I wouldn’t even know where to begin with spelling it. To be honest I haven’t heard it in so long I sometimes forget it. I am a lower ranking demon only permitted in the less actiony sides of Hell. I don’t get to see to the torture of the damned or anything fun. I mainly herd souls and preform the bidding of the higher ranks. Subject to abuse and carrying out tasks no one wants to do like making sure the rivers continue to flow and aren’t being too clogged up from all the bodies stacking up and thrashing desperately in the current. 

   Today Ive been tasked with breaking up large ice formations from relentless rains here in Beelzebub’s territory. One of the most horrifically uncomfortable lords to speak with but I stay on his good side by having an offering ready for every meet. He might not love what you have to offer but he’s not exactly picky either. I watch the damned roam aimlessly through the storm while I chip away at the ice. Eyes frozen shut with the fierce winds peeling back their frostbitten flesh exposing the blackening muscle and bone beneath. If the ice formations get too large the humans will use them to try and escape the elements. Pointless really. I chuckled to myself at their expense. I hacked away at the ice revealing long abandoned fingers, limbs and strips of faces past souls weren’t able to free from the structure’s cold grip. That was when I saw it. A glimmering thread appeared from nowhere just in-front of me.

   These threads are doorways so to speak. A bridge to something from the mortal plane that is essentially available for possession. Exceptionally rare especially in these parts and just within arms reach.. it was beautiful. “HEY”! I snapped my head around. “Don’t you fucking move, Imp”. I had stared for too long, I should’ve known higher ranking demons would be alerted and drawn to its location. I froze, my whole body clenched and vibrating violently with fear and excitement of what could be. If I were to disobey I can’t imagine the suffering I would endure. Once I was through though who could reach me?

   My head felt heavy at the thought but my eyes were forcing my focus on the thread. It’s right here! Right in front of me! The opportunity and escape I’ve yearned for, for centuries. I couldn’t ignore this moment, I had to take the chance and finally become everything I knew I could be. I inhaled sharply and quickly grasped the thread and with my last sight being the absolute rage of the demon rushing towards me everything went dark.

   I felt light as I regained my consciousness. Floating in a pool of blackness when I began to hear distant mumbling. It slowly grew louder, less muffled as I opened my eyes. It was bright and took a moment to focus. “What is.. Where am I?” I looked ahead at a man staring back at me with frustration in his eyes. “COME ON!” He gave a short but forceful shove into me. “Damn thing never works right.” He stormed off. “What the fuck was that about?” I asked myself. I took a moment to focus and learn what I had become a part of. As the full picture of my possession came into view my jaw dropped. “No…NO!…. NO NO NO, FUCK!” It wasn’t true, it couldn’t be! My heart raced with confusion, panic and sheer embarrassment as my situation became more and more clear to me…. It was a coffee machine… I have possessed a God damned coffee machine.

   After a few hours or so of trying to calm myself down I was able to look around and listen to people coming and going and have  drawn the full unfortunate picture of my situation. I am now a large coffee machine in the break room of some machine company. Bearings I think is what I heard they make here. “It’s fine, this is fine” I thought. “I’ll just bail! Return to Hell and explain myself.. They’ll probably all laugh!”But I knew this wouldn’t be the case. 

   To back out of a possession was considered dishonorable. Not that honor exists where I’m from but it was looked at as failure or cowardice. Should I return I’d be subject to tortures and humiliations far worse than what most humans receive. I was stuck here in the decision I’ve made. My thoughts were interrupted by another man staring at me blankly deciding on what type of coffee he wanted. He pressed A3 and a lukewarm black coffee was dispensed. He took a sip, let out a unsatisfied sigh and left. “Maybe… maybe there’s hope here” I thought. It’s not what I had envisioned but there is opportunity here. I just needed to think. “These people… drink from me. I can dictate what they ingest.. I can have a direct effect on them internally!.. Not sure where it could go from there but it’s something”. With this clarity I’ve decided to stick it out and have gained a new excitement for what could be. 

  The first work break of the day has started. A few people sitting around at the lunch tables rambling about their pathetic lives and what a shithole place they think this is. Finally my first target has approached me. An older fat woman breathing heavily and biting her disgusting nails as she looked over her options. “We really need more options in this ol thang”. She chose E4, a cappuccino. Admittedly I was caught off guard a little. I was so taken back by this putrid ogre I hadn’t even thought of a plan for the drink. Quickly I allowed many small and sharp, hair sized, shards of plastic to peel from the dispenser into her coffee. In time my strength will grow but for now it’s the best I can muster. I was so excited watching her I didn’t realize I was holding my breath as she walked back to her table. She took a few sips each one followed by a low grunt clearing her throat. The grunts grew louder and were eventually followed by coughs that became too rough for her to ignore. At this point the whole break room had taken notice. “Excu- *cough* excuse me” she said standing up quickening her pace to the restroom. She placed a hand on the door and coughed a wonderful red and brown mist all down the face of it. 

   A few jumped out of their seats while most seemed stunned or unable to register what had happened. Her knees buckled, she gripped her stomach and let out a gasp that sounded as if her lungs were filled with rust and spit. Her forehead hit the floor while she unleashed a painful broken up shriek like a toddler. Two men grabbed her up and ran her out the door frantically with trickles of muddy crimson behind them. Just like that the room had gone from chaos to silence with nothing but the confused and terrified faces of her coworkers. Sweet ecstasy in my veins.

   By lunch time I’ve found out the ogre woman had been rushed to the hospital. No word on her condition but I hope for the worst. Some are still worried but things went back to normal here pretty quickly. The janitor had cleaned the mess and it became just a story. Gossip for these oblivious apes. It was when I heard someone mention it could’ve been the cappuccino that I decided to change up my strategy. I want to stick around here and perhaps the best way to do that is to make people actually enjoy their coffees. That’ll ensure my progress. Unfortunately word about the cappuccino got to higher ups and the next day an inspector had come to check the machine. I made sure to have the inside spotless as if brand spanking new. So much so that the inspector looked puzzled as to why he’d even been called. Supervisors gave the ok and the workers were back to ordering their drinks again. Lucky for them I knew exactly how to keep them coming back.

   Three days have passed since inspection and business has been booming. So many delighted faces ordering, pressing their gnarled oily fingers against the console grinning ear to ear. Some coming back three to four times a day even. It’s all thanks to an extra little ingredient. Enough time has passed for me to have grown a bit stronger and allow me to reach into Hell for resources to help aid me. Nothing major but I’ve found that I can acquire liquids. In this case, the blood of aborted fetuses and infants fresh from Moloch’s mountain. 

   A breathtaking sight to behold, I’ll show it to your goofy mustached ass when you get down here after reading. The babies plummet into Hell slamming down onto each other and the hot jagged rocks blistering their skin as the blood is continuously pulled from them down the mountain feeding into Moloch’s moats. I had always been attracted to their pain the most. Older children and adults are able to relate their pain. Should they be impaled on hot iron they’re aware of what is happening. They understand the source and feeling of their torture. Infants however are unique in their suffering. 

   They can’t process or avoid the pain let alone form a single intelligent thought as to what is happening and why. It is the purest form of anguish there is. The blood of a tortured infant also has rejuvenating effects. Makes you feel and look younger and just happier in general. Humans with power and influence love to partake in its effects but are unaware of how rapidly it rots the already condemned soul. They’re basically stomping on the gas pedal to eternal damnation just to feel a bit more energetic. Even better it’s far more addicting than any drug and the withdrawals are immediate. Ever seen an extremely attractive celebrity look shockingly old and worn out seemingly overnight? Well now you know. 

  “Hey hurry the hell up, Tom” Joe yelled from the back of the line. “I’m goin I’m goin just give me a second! Now do I want the espresso.. or cappuccino.. orrr..” Tom mumbled. Joe is one of my favorites here. Ex military, extremely short tempered and paranoid. Blames it on his years of service even though he never stepped foot into a combat zone. He spends most of his day sucking on his tongue looking for what other people are doing wrong. And Tom! Sweet simple Tom. A knuckle dragging slob whose mind moves slower than his feet. A big softy. Susan steps in: “knock it off you two it’s not goin nowhere”. The company’s token sweet old lady who can’t help but make the occasional racist remark here and there. The janitor is an interesting one too. Deeply religious and lately I’ve seen him nervously fiddle with the small crucifix around his neck whenever he enters the room. God had gifted man with a sense for danger that they  like to call gut feelings. Such a simple and powerful thing yet the majority of them simply ignore it and go on to ruin their lives or others’. 

   With every cup they consume I can feel myself connecting with them more and more. Not enough to take full control but enough to follow and observe them within the building. Joe however I’ve easily built an influence on. His depression and anger practically served as a damn welcome mat. I like to make him uncomfortably warm and forget where he would place things now and then. Small things that build up in an attempt to spark some violence. Nothing yet but he’ll snap, he just needs more time. Now that I’ve essentially created a building of addicts it’s time to shake things up. I’ve brought the temperature of the coffees down to just barely passable as warm and have completely replaced the infant blood with swamp water from Aeshma’s circle. 

   Filled with the blood, sweat, bile and waste from hateful souls condemned to endlessly beat each other to the death they wish would come but never arrives. Obviously I’ve tweaked the flavor to make it more tasteful but it should help to liven things up around here. The first to partake in this new blend is Frankie. A new father of twins and without paid paternity leave is forced to work all day while facing sleepless nights at home. A perfect cocktail of frustration and exhaustion. “Ughh what the fuck dude” he dumped his cup and hit to refill hoping it was just a bad batch but was pissed and saddened to taste the same result. “Damnit man, I was really looking forward to this.”

   Disappointment all around this morning. 
Tempers are beginning to flare as some curse the company and supervisors names. Around the building you could see how sluggish and upset everyone was. I decided to spend time with Sasha, a somewhat new hire. She’d always stop by to order hot tea or the decaf options. Who the hell gets a decaf coffee by the way?.. Anyways.. 
She was still training on these machines, Bihlers they’re called. Massive machines meant to cut and shape metals of various thicknesses. She’s got the hang of it but today is special. She is tired, agitated and unfocused making simple mistakes. 

   The machine is running, pulling a long strip of steel into it at a quick rate. I’ve had her overthinking this job and just as she was about to step back I forced her head in the direction of a small piece of tape on the line traveling towards the Bihler. I leaned forward into her ear and softly whispered: “If you don’t remove the tape in time it will ruin this job and the tooling in the machine”. She lunged forward without a thought gripping the tape but before she could rip it off the speed and pull of the line yanked her arm into the machine’s flattener. 

   Seven large metal wheels gripped her finger tips crushing and splintering the bones as her arm was passed from one to another. Skin flattening, ballooning and popping open to release blasts of blood and muscle as the bone ripped its way through any available openings it could find. Her screams filled every nook and corner of the building until she was elbow deep into the hungry machine. Instead of feeding in straight now the mashed mess of what was once her arm is being fed downward forcing her further in until her upper torso was forced sideways through the small opening in the side. Her raspy wails were silenced in an instant as her neck was snapped and her face imbedded into the opposite shoulder. The lead operator had finally reached the emergency stop button but it was far too late. It took only seconds. 

   It’s been sometime since anyone’s been called back into work. Past few days have been only police, managers and clean up crews trying to piece together what had happened. On camera it’s clearly a horrific case of operator error but it’s also been discovered that the machines error sensors had been turned off at some unknown point in time. Had they still been on she would’ve only lost a hand or some fingers. Management keeps pointing out her actions clearly more concerned about the potential lawsuit than saddened by the young woman’s death. Seems the case will be getting wrapped up soon. It’s been far too quiet and boring here. My mind wanders thinking of the workers. What they’re doing and what I could plan for them upon their return. 

   I thought of Frankie probably relieved to have time at home. A bummer really. He was getting to such a low point, so vulnerable. My mouth salivated at how close I was to taking him next but now who knows. I started hearing muffled voices. I had started to wish the police would move on elsewhere but.. it wasn’t their voices. When I opened my eyes I was stunned to see that I was standing over Frankie in his own home! He was rocking one crying child while the wife fed another. Before I had a chance to take it all in I was back in the coffee machine. Back in that silent cold colorless room. I began laughing. A quiet chuckle that quickly grew into hysterical euphoria. My body shook with the excitement with the realization of how far I’ve come in my work. Though he’s had time at home Frankie has yet to gain any real rest and I had completely forgotten the withdrawals he must be feeling on top of everything else. The bridge isn’t strong enough yet but I’m so close. I clinched my fist tightly and began to drool “you’re mine.. all of you”.

   It’s been nine days since Sasha’s death and everyone has returned to work. Many upset saying it’s far too soon and distasteful considering what happened but when a major companies losing millions sooner or later they’re going to crack that whip. Seems the Janitor quit too! Suppose he listened to that gut of his. It’s a shame though, I really wanted him. There’s a beautiful smell in the air this morning. Everyone scowling, pissed as hell, ready to go into a rage from the swamp water and extreme fatigue from blood withdrawal. I’ve changed nothing with the swamp mix other than serving some cold and others scalding hot. The smallest inconveniences can drive many to their breaking point. 

   Two fist fights have already happened in the parking lot and one worker, Ray, has been in a screaming match with HR and a supervisor. I’ll have to check in on that later. Frankie is walking this way and I see a golden opportunity with having just poured Susan a boiling hot green tea. As the two begin walking towards each other down the hall I blocked her from his view and quickly lifted his hand outward. In one swift motion Frankie not only palmed Susan’s entire right breast but also delivered a hard shove forcing her into the wall. Susan yelled as she tried to catch herself: “what the hell are you doing pervert”? Frankie was almost too surprised to speak. “Nn.. what? where did you come from? I- I didn’t mean- “
Susan interrupted “you just assaulted me you damn pig” she delivered a weak but quick slap to his left cheek. Frankie snapped back “fuck you, you old goat, no one would ever want to touch your disgusting raisin ass body”! Susan then threw her tea into Frankie’s face and marched away as he dropped to one knee burying his face into his shirt screaming. Frankie had to be driven to the hospital while Susan was fired shortly after. 

   After a long drawn out argument with the supervisors Susan stormed out of the building and climbed into her car unaware that I was tagging along. She sped down the interstate ranting to herself “stupid arrogant assholes.. thirty eight fucking years I gave that company!! They wouldn’t be anything without me those damned fools”! With a hard blink she was no longer in her car. Susan was now standing in a void. Blackness and silence in every direction other than her own echoed breathing. She stepped forward, surprised at the small splash from her foot. The shallow liquid under her feet was as black as the space around her. 

   In a low heavy sigh I breathed her name aloud. “Susan..” She spun around releasing a mix between a gasp and shriek. “Wha… who’s there?.. Where am I”? 
“Its alright Susan, everything’s going to be ok…. You’re home now”. Hundreds of tar soaked pruning arms tore out of the abyss beneath her grabbing onto her with the intensity of someone drowning, desperately trying to lift themselves over whatever they could for a single breath. Her screams and struggles were pointless as the overwhelming hoard of arms pulled her down slowly. Shoulder deep at this point with every inch of her covered by hands digging their cracked nails into her flesh, hair and clothing. She managed to look up and gazed into my eyes staring back down at her. I placed a finger on her forehead and delivered a gentle push down. Tears streamed down her face and her muffled whimpers were silenced as she sank below the surface. Susan gasped awake back behind the wheel of her car on the interstate and collided with an oncoming sixteen wheeler at ninety three miles an hour. There was nothing left.

   Back at work not much has changed. We’re early into the next morning and things are slow. A police officer, a detective, a company supervisor and some fancy suit are all speaking at one of the tables. “I can assure you gentleman nothing is out of the ordinary here. We’re running as smoothly as ever! All of theeeeese… incidents are just unfortunate luck”. 
The detective spoke: “incidents? Mr Fuller two of your employees have died. Another two are in the hospital, three are missing and the rest are frighteningly angry! All within a month! Now maybe this IS all just a hell of a bad luck streak or something very serious is going on here”.
The officer looked over: “Y’all do work with a lot of hazardous chemicals here. Maybe it’s having a violent effect on the workers”? 

   The fancy suit stood up with a sigh and made his way over to the coffee machine. I smirked. Here’s another tally mark for the scoreboard. The detective called to him: “getting bored of the conversation, sir”? The suit chuckled: “Bored of you three maybe. But no this whole thing has caught quite a bit of attention back at base”. 
Mr Fuller was sweating making sure not to say anything that could bring suspicion on the company. The detective leaned back: “I’m sure we’ll get to the bottom of it, sir”. 
“Oh I’m sure you will. I’ll be keeping an eye on your work, detective”. The suit said looking back. A tall pale man, he wore a confident half smile and had the calmest expression while looking over the drink options. “We’ve been watching your progress you know. Impressive stuff”. He pressed H3, French vanilla coffee. I wanted this mortal for sure so I made sure to heavy up the dosage of tortured fetal blood along with an alluring fragrance found in the iron briar patches of Asmodeus. 

   He took a large gulp a released a satisfied exhale. “Damn good coffee. Tastes just like home.. am I right”? He looked up making direct eye contact with me. I froze. “There’s no way.. is .. does he see me”? I looked behind him, the others were like mannequins. The clock on the wall, the birds outside the window. All frozen in time. “Hey relax in there, I just thought I’d swing by and pay a visit. It’s been a long time since I’ve been so eager to see someone’s next move”. He made his way to the window looking out at what might as well have been a photograph. He took another large sip from his coffee. “I knew I had better keep an eye on you after seeing you blatantly disobey a higher up to get here”. He looked back at me with a sharp intensity. “Try not to disappoint”.
He was gone before I had a chance to speak. The birds continued by and the now three men were continuing on as if there had never been a fourth at all. The world was back in motion and I was filled with pride for knowing that I had finally been seen. But by who I wonder.

   The pressures on now. I’ve got eyes on me from Hell and who knows where else. Everyone in this God forsaken building is right where I want them though. I’m doubling down on the swamp water, keeping the pleasant aroma and adding one new ingredient. The pulverized, nearly liquified, meat of the souls trapped within Beelzebub’s lower jaw. They’re scooped up from the chasm he resides in and forever mashed and churned between the many rows of his molars. You’d think in this state there’d be nothing left of the body or soul but everything remains. Even while mush, spread out between the grooves of the teeth, the pain of being chewed feels to them like the very first crunch every single time. We’re four hours into the work day and it’s time for lunch. The room is packed tight. Everyone sitting scarfing down their food in between agitated breathes, most on their fifth or sixth drink of the day. The air is thick with a menacing tension.

Joe slams open the door entering the break room and marching over to Tom sitting shakily over his meal. “Tom! Hey shit head, you wana tell me why I’ve got all your scrap by my machine”? I noticed Joe was gripping a small screwdriver lightly coated in oil and metal dust. He bent down, now an inch from Tom’s face. “Answer me you fat slob! All you do is wreck everything and leave behind a mess and food crumbs everywhe-“! Joes verbal assault is suddenly cut short. Wide eyed with a confused and frightened look Joe chokes up blood and slowly grips the hefty plastic knife Tom has imbedded deep into his jugular. 

   Deafening silence lasts for mere seconds before Tom slams him to the table and begins pounding his fist into Joe’s temple repeatedly. Spurts of blood hit Samantha’s face who was sitting across from Tom. She licks the splattered blood off her lower lip and a cold dimness overtakes the eyes. She lunges across the table removing the knife from Joe’s throat and digging her fingers deep into the slit desperately removing and devouring whatever she can. All hell breaks loose as a bloody free for all erupts between the workers. Derick has Steven in an arm bar as he eats away at the wrist. Beth is sobbing uncontrollably beating her head against the concrete wall. The rest are caught in unrelenting fist fights and crazed self mutilation. I walked slowly between the symphony of carnage I had orchestrated. I nearly shed a tear witnessing the beauty of it all. Oh and I finally found Ray! He had locked himself in a storage closet eating away and the bloated corpses of the HR lady and supervisor he had dragged in days earlier. He clawed at the side of his face while crying quietly and nervously to himself between each bite. 

  As I was soaking it all in I quickly realized that Frankie was missing out on all the fun! I shut my eyes, focused and opened them back up to see that I was standing beside Frankie in his bed. Face bandaged up unable to sleep and recover. His mind racing with bills, self doubts as a father and provider. The list goes on and on. I can hear his wife and children in the next room. The sounds of crying and hushing rattling his eardrums. I knelt down beside him and whispered thoughts into his mind. “There is a way out. A way to quiet all the stress and be rid of it”. His eyes shifted downward slowly. “You know exactly what you have to do. It would only take seconds.. Merciful really.. you can finally bring peace to this family”. He sat up out of bed and made his way to the closet. He hesitated a moment before opening the door to reveal a loaded shotgun amidst coats and old moving boxes. 

   He had never really been interested in guns. It was a paranoid purchase thinking he’d need it for the protection of his family. I made the shrill cries of his children ring unbearably loud in his ears. Shaking violently he grabbed the shotgun and burst into the next room. His wife jumped in shock unable to process what just entered the room. “FRANKIE?!” she yelled. “Wha- what are you doing”? She grabbed both babies and held them tightly to her chest. “Honey.. please.. I- I know things haven’t been great lately, we’ve been through so much but please y- you have to calm down”! Her words went unheard. Muffled by the ear piercing ringing and cries I’ve locked in his head. Tears streamed down his face. “Im.. Im so sorry” he said. I gently helped him to raise the gun and wrapped my hands over his. Both our fingers planted on the trigger. She tried to speak but fear kept anything other than short panicked cries from escaping her mouth. My eyes grew large, I clinched my teeth hard with the largest smile I had ever worn. We planted the stock  of the shotgun firmly into our shoulders and as he screamed out we squeezed the trigger. 

   With a powerful kick and loud bang we put a hole straight into the ceiling. Silence. She stared at him unblinking, mouth open. Frankie dropped the shotgun and I felt a hard shove back from him. “What the fuck?!” I yelled. He dropped to his knees sobbing “I’m - I’m so sorry! I don’t know what’s wrong with me! What’s happening to me! I can’t think I can’t do anything I.. I”.
She scooted forward with the babies now on both of their laps and wrapped her arms around him crying. “It’s ok!.. It’s ok.. I know.. I love you.. WE love you. We’ll get through this together”. He looked down. His two perfect baby girls, his entire world right in his lap. He held his wife and children and a bright light slammed against my face with a force that felt as if it could have easily killed me right then and there. 

   I awoke back in the coffee machine dazed and weak. The break room was dark and empty. Faded blood stains everywhere throughout. “How… how long have I been out?.. What the hell hit me”? I tried to leave the machine but couldn’t. My body felt in shambles. From the look of the stains it’s been at least four, maybe six weeks I thought. Voices grew loud quickly. In walked the officer and detective from before along with a few others wearing some type of hazmat cleanup suits. 

  “Tell you what I’ll be happy to never step foot in this place again” said the detective. “Tell me about it. The demolition crew can’t get here soon enough”. My heart sank. “This is it.. I’ll be buried in this rubble and returned to Hell”. I was worried but my body ached too much for me to act out or draw them in. I slumped down defeated. 
“Alright everyone let’s clear out of here. The boys will be here soon to finish this place off”. One by one I watched as they left out the door single file. Their hurried paces reminded me of how quickly it all went by. I relaxed accepting my fate. Perhaps I’ll be welcomed home with praises and a new rank. I grinned and closed my eyes to the satisfying thought. And then I felt it… *A3*. ",2,1765191557.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Hey, I’m Nick. 24. Southern Minnesota.

I’m pretty quiet when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable, I’m that goofy, loyal friend who hypes you up over literally anything. I don’t take life too seriously. I’m mostly just trying to meet people I genuinely click with.

**About me**

If the weather’s even halfway decent, I’m outside. Hiking, biking, fishing, wandering around with no plan, all of it. If there’s even the slightest chance of seeing the northern lights, I’m chasing them. And honestly, laying in the middle of nowhere staring at the sky is one of the best feelings ever.

The gym is my grounding place. I go a few times a week just to keep my mental and physical health in check.

My favorite color is pink, even though I somehow only own black clothes.

I also cook. Like… actually cook. And if we become friends, there’s a good chance you’ll end up getting fed something fancy for no reason other than “I felt like making this.”

I love movies; especially horror, and I have a soft spot for those ridiculous ’90s action films that are so awful they become masterpieces.  
I thrift a lot too. I’m always on the hunt for old Disney VHS tapes and other tapes I can get my hands on

I’m big on physical media in general. Books, manga, movies. if we go thrifting together, I *will* vanish into the book and VHS aisle for an embarrassing amount of time.

Some nights I’m sweating in League or CS, other nights I’m peacefully farming in Animal Crossing. I also love retro gaming. I still use my PS1 and Wii like they came out yesterday.

**My vibe?**  
honestly, if you’re kind, a little weird, and into doing fun random stuff, we’ll get along.

I’ve got tattoos, a closet full of band tees, and a music taste that makes zero sense but somehow works.

If we get along, I’d rather hang out at some point in person! Grab coffee, thrift, movie night, stargaze. (If you're local!)

**Green flags**

* Loyal
* Supportive
* Will actually show up
* Good relationship with my mom

**Red flags:**

* Occasionally clueless
* Slow to open up
* Mental health is a work in progress

**Beige flags:**

* Lives in black clothes
* Night owl
* Will stop everything to point out a cute animal
* Winnie the Pooh is peak comfort

**Music:**  
Everything from Rap to Emo/Screamo to Yacht Rock to Classic Country to Nu Metal. Bowie, Prince, ABBA, Linkin Park, Creed, Steely Dan, Paramore, MCR, SOAD… the list is endless.  
Recently obsessed with South Arcade. if you know them you earn bonus points.

**What I’m looking for:**  
Just good people, honestly. Someone a little weird, up for random adventures or chill nights with pizza and horror movies. Someone who likes talking about hobbies, swapping music, that kinda thing.

If you’re curious, hit me up.

And being in the U.S. (or maybe Canada) makes things easier with time zones! Please refrain from messaging if you aren't. I likely won't respond as such large time zone differences make it hard to have lasting meaningful connections.",1,1765191389.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

It's supposed to have chocolatey notes, classic taste. But the aftertaste is very woody and not very good.

I was doubting myself and bought another ""Espresso"" coffee when I was shopping in an Oxfam shop. They have these 1kg bags Espresso beans (80% arabica). They're roasted slightly darker but not oily. Some beans still have the light colored husk. And I can pull a good chocolate tasting espresso out of that EASILY.

People need to wake up smell the coffee, this many players being out of form is a little bit too much to be just bad attitude or not following the managers instructions. 

First all all, the loss against Celta, starting fucking Fran Garcia and playing carreras at cb when he has Tchouameni that has played in the position multiple times and starting Guler in I dont even know what fucking position he was literally invisible yesterday. People need to understand the manager picks the team and if the team plays bad then the manager should get the brunt of the blame.

Lets dig deeper though, back when we had prime Madrid with the Ronnies and Marcelos and Ramos, against 95 percent of teams we could dominate, but even back then we struggled against low block teams and against high press and high possession of Barcelona, so against Atletico, we relied more on balls in the box and getting bodies in the box and against Barca we played a low block and used quick counter attack, same against Bayern. This just goes to show that even our best best team we didn't approach every game and opposition the same way.

Nowadays the only teams we seem to do well against is teams that play a suicidal high line. We suck against a press, against a low block, against teams that cross, literally against almost every team except teams that go gung ho and leave lots of space behind. That means that the manager is not preparing tactically for these matches. Can you imagine how frustrating it is to be a winger and a full back, getting the ball and having 2 to 3 defenders facing you and thinking if only i could cross to someone and looking up and seeing no one in the box every time.

Bellingham barely gets in the box anymore because we apparently have a striker now, but the striker also doesn't get in the box but everyone expects our wingers and full backs to create, create for who? You ruined Bellinghams best attributes, you've neutered our wingers, or midfielders don't know what to do half time and one player is scoring all the goals which means when teams stop him the whole team is stopped.

If people Bellingham, Tchouameni and lets say one of the defenders get in the box, that gives room on the edge for a Valverde, cut backs don't work if there are not other people crashing the box taking defenders attention away. We try to play slow possession football against every single team even when that's not the ideal thing to do tactically. 

While I agree that some players are not up to the level and need to go, the team is not going to magically sell 8 players in January and replace them with another 8. That means if results keep slipping whether you like it or not Xabi is out.",3,1765191332.0,realmadrid,49,0.55,False

1ph9eh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ph9eh3/i_created_a_fake_persona_for_tiktok_i_regret/,I created a fake persona for TikTok. I regret everything.,"It all started a few weeks ago. I was looking for ways to earn some extra money, so I decided to make some videos on TikTok.

There was a problem, though. First, I am a near 40 year old mother of 3 kids, and we know the algorithm doesn’t favor unpretty people. Second, I wasn’t thrilled about other moms, and friends, and family members possibly finding my account. I’d definitely get roasted for it during the holidays.

So I made a persona.

That is, I did several questionable things: I bought a long black wig (my usual hair is short and light brown.) I wore completely different makeup. And I used a filter. And I called myself Katherine, dissimilar enough from my real name (Kasey.)

The result was a beautiful woman who looked like she was in her early 30s, and only vaguely resembled me.

I started off by posting skits about working in retail, since that’s what I’d done before having kids. Then I transitioned to unboxing-type videos, that I also posted on YouTube shorts. At first the videos sort of flubbed, but then, I got a few to go viral. I wasn’t some big household name or anything, but it was enough to make a few hundred extra bucks a month.

Things were looking up.

Everything started spiraling the week after Thanksgiving.

I noticed a comment on one of my videos. *Haha!,* it read. *I’m from Ohio too!*

I froze. *Did I say that in the video?* I was always very careful to not let any personal details slip, despite the persona.

I rewatched the video. I watched as “Katherine” pulled a labubu out of a box. “It took a while to get all the way here to Ohio,” she/I said with a little chuckle.

I froze. *Oh shit, I actually did say that.*

I rewound and replayed that part. Again and again. I really didn’t remember saying that. As I watched it, I noticed something else, too: the video almost seemed to glitch for the tiniest moment, before I said it. My face froze and jumped, like the video was spliced.

A terrible idea swirled in my head. *TikTok isn’t like... adding AI clips to videos... is it?*

It sounded insane. But I remembered one of my friends telling me a few weeks ago about her Facebook ads she was running: there were so many AI features that added extra stuff to her images and descriptions, it was like a full-time job turning every single AI setting off.

Was TikTok... doing the same thing?

*I must’ve just let it slip,* I thought. Nothing else to it.

But then it kept happening.

On a video where I unboxed some lotion. A comment saying, *there’s no way you’re 42.* I watched the video and, sure enough. Katherine/I stretched my lips into a broad, toothy smile, and said “It does wonders for my 42-year-old skin.”

*I know I didn’t say that.* I mean, who even says “42-year-old skin?” That was such a weird phrase, it almost felt like an AI had spit it out. Sure enough, when I rewatched the video--there was that odd glitch again. My face froze for a split second, then jerked upwards, before I delivered the line.

*Even if it’s AI. How would it know I live in Ohio? How would it know I’m 42?*

*The internet knows everything about you,* a little voice in the back of my head whispered. *Oh yeah. It knows you like dark chocolate caramel and cold brew coffee. It knows your circulation’s shit, because it keeps giving you ads for socks and slippers. It knows you’re a night owl and you like birdwatching and...*

I slammed my phone on the desk. Next time I made a video, I would look at every option with a fine-tooth comb, making sure I did *not* in any way enable an AI thing.

But of course, the video I posted the next day had the same thing. And it was worse, so much worse, than the other two.

“It’s got my initials, see?” she/I said, as I pulled out a keychain with my initials on it: KSB. As the filter shifted ever-so-slightly on my face, she smiled and said: “K, for Kasey.”

*I said Kasey.*

*No, no, no.*

*I was* sure *I’d said Katherine. Because I remember—I* remember *almost saying Kasey, and then catching myself saying Katherine.*

*There’s no way.*

I quit. Stopped uploading videos. Stopped opening the app. My earnings quickly dropped without new content, but I didn’t care. This was creepy. I knew I said Katherine. There’s no way I said Kasey.

… Was there?

The next morning, I woke up to a notification on my phone.

Not from TikTok or YouTube.

From our Ring camera.

Someone had been in our front yard at 3:24 AM.

I pulled up the video, confused. *Probably just a bug or animal or something.* But as I watched, all the blood drained out of my face.

Just beyond our porch stairs stood a figure. Their outline was blurry and pixelated, since they were halfway in the dark. And they were standing facing away from the porch.

But they looked like they had long, dark, slightly-wavy hair.

*Just like my wig.*

The woman stood there for two full seconds before slowly walking back into the darkness.

“Who *is* that?” my husband asked, not seeming to make the connection.

“I don’t know. Who would be out that late?”

“I think Karin gets up at like 4, doesn’t she?” he said, referring to the older woman across the street who’d been a competitive swimmer in a different lifetime.

“Yeah, but her hair isn’t that long.” I swallowed. “Doesn’t it sort of look like… well, the wig I wear, when I do the videos.”

He glanced over at me. “A lot of women have hair like that.”

I swallowed. “Do you think we should tell the police?”

“She isn’t really *doing* anything... maybe let’s talk to the neighbors and see if anyone else caught her.”

I would’ve called the police, but we lived in a townhouse development—there were about thirty houses within a hundred feet of us, counting the ones across the street. The woman *was* standing technically in our front yard, but that’s only about ten feet from the sidewalk. It could be any one of our neighbors, or anyone visiting them. Not someone particularly targeting us.

Their hair did match the wig. But my husband didn’t think it was an issue. So I decided it wasn’t, either.

I kept an eye on the Ring camera for the next few days, but nothing happened. No weird visits, no strange women skulking around outside. So I wrote it off as a one-off thing.

On a whim, I checked my TikTok page to check the stats on my videos and see if I was accumulating any residual views for this month’s income.

As the page loaded, my blood turned to ice.

There was a new video. A video I didn’t upload.

The thumbnail was different than the other videos. It was dark, and she appeared to be... outside?

My stomach plummeted.

Hands shaking, I opened the video.

She was standing in the dark.

In front of a row of townhouses.

*In front of my house.*

Her filter-smoothed face was barely visible in the low light. The right half of it was completely black, completely in shadow. Her dark hair swayed loosely in the wind. She looked down at the camera, her one lit eye glittering in the streetlamp.

She smiled.

And then the video ended.

It looped like that several times before I reacted and closed out of the app. I stared at the phone, shaking in my hands.

*Fuck, fuck, fuck.*

Someone was stalking me. Someone was using the same filters and wig to look like my persona. But they knew where I lived, and they knew it was me, and they *fucking hacked my account.*

I called the police. I told them everything. I showed them the videos, every single one. Part of me expected the video of her, me, in the dark to be gone by the time the police came, but it was still there.

I hadn’t imagined it.

The police searched the neighborhood. Made a report. Promised to talk to neighbors. Told me to keep my doors locked. To call them at the first sign of trouble.

But without the woman right there to track down, it wasn’t easy. It would take days to find out who hacked my account, even if they could get TikTok to comply.

So I packed us up and we drove to my mom’s. We’d stay there for the next few days, until we had an update.

“I knew that whole TikTok thing was a bad idea,” my husband said after the kids had gone to bed.

“I know. I’m sorry.”

“This is bad. Really bad.” He hung his face in his hands. “Did you delete the account, at least?”

“Not yet.”

“Do it. Do it now.”

“But the police might need it to see who--”

“Delete it!”

I logged in and deleted the account. Thankfully, there were no new videos. Just that same one of her standing outside the streetlamp.

I finally got in bed around 2 AM. But I still couldn’t sleep. I was tossing and turning, wondering when we could go back home, what this woman’s deal was.

I finally gave up on sleep and walked out into the kitchen to get a snack.

As I walked towards the refrigerator, something caught my eye outside.

*No.*

There was a figure standing at the treeline behind my mom’s house. Pale skin. Long dark hair. Standing absolutely still, like a mannequin, just barely visible in the shadows.

I flicked off the lights and reached for my phone. But I’d left it upstairs. I looked down, patting my pockets--

Motion caught my eye.

I froze.

She was standing only ten feet from the door now. And she looked... *exactly...* like my persona. Down to the filters, but in real life. Eyes that were slightly too big. Skin that was poreless and smooth. Pouty perfect lips. But she still carried an uncanny resemblance to me. My pointed chin, my heart-shaped face, my tall stature and long legs.

I finally ran up the stairs, got my phone, and called the police.

And again, they didn’t find anything, despite combing every inch of the property.

It’s been two weeks, and I haven’t seen her since. My husband assumes the “crazy stalker” lost interest.

But I know better.

Because when I looked at myself in the mirror last night, I saw several strands of jet-black hair growing from my scalp.

And I wonder if she’s waiting.

Skin that was poreless and smooth. Pouty perfect lips. But she still carried an uncanny resemblance to me. My pointed chin, my heart-shaped face, my tall stature and long legs.

I finally ran up the stairs, got my phone, and called the police.

And again, they didn’t find anything, despite combing every inch of the property.

It’s been two weeks, and I haven’t seen her since. My husband assumes the “crazy stalker” lost interest.

But I know better.

Because when I looked at myself in the mirror last night, I saw several strands of jet-black hair growing from my scalp.

And I wonder if she’s waiting.

Not because they hate people, but because they don’t know what to say beyond “How are you?” or “What do you do?” It’s socially exhausting, low-reward, and often feels fake. But the reality is, small talk isn’t the enemy. It’s a social tool. And once you learn how to use it right, it can unlock deeper connections, help you network effortlessly, and stop you from spiraling into awkward silence at every wedding, coffee shop line, or elevator ride.

I’ve been digging into the psychology behind conversationshow warmth and connection are built in seconds. This guide is built from actual research, psychology books, and expert-backed podcast insightsnot shallow TikTok hacks from “extroverts” who just want to go viral. Let’s fix your small talk game with actual science.

Here are the top 9 evidence-based tricks + favorite resources (books, apps, podcasts) to make your small talk UNSTOPPABLY good.

1. Ask questions that actually spark emotion  

Harvard psychologists found that people feel closer to someone who asks follow-up questions, not just basic ones. Instead of “So, what do you do?”, ask “What’s the most interesting part of your week so far?” The key is to trigger emotion, not data. People connect through feelings, not resumes.  

(Source: Harvard Business Review research, 2017)

2. Use the “FORD” method when you’re stuck  

This is gold from Vanessa Van Edwards (behavioral investigator, founder of Science of People). When you’re blanking on what to ask, think:  

F = Family  

O = Occupation  

R = Recreation  

D = Dreams  

Questions like “What do you love to do on weekends?” or “What would you do if you weren’t doing this job?” opens doors fast.

3. Ditch the fake smile. Use microexpressions instead  

According to Dr. Paul Ekman, microexpressions (that 1-second genuine flash of emotion) speak louder than words. A sincere eye crinkle or slightly raised eyebrow shows actual interest. People can tell the difference. Be present, not performative.

4. Reveal just a little vulnerability  

Social psychologist Dr. Arthur Aron’s famous “36 Questions” study showed that intimacy is built through mutual vulnerability. You don’t need to trauma dump. Even saying “Honestly, I always find these events a little overwhelming, but I’m glad we met” can make people open up back to you.

5. Match their energy, then lead  

If you’re talking to someone low-energy, don’t hit them with hyperactive vibes. Mirror their tone first, then slowly raise the enthusiasm. This strategy, called “pacing and leading,” is used in negotiation and therapy for a reasonit works.  

(Source: Chris Voss, former FBI hostage negotiator, author of Never Split The Difference)

6. Repeat and reflect what they say  

This one’s from the world of therapy and hostage negotiation. When someone says “I’ve been super busy with work,” respond with “Busy with work?” or “That sounds like a lot.” This shows you’re really listening. According to research from the University of Chicago, reflective listening boosts trust instantly.

7. Use names strategically  

Dale Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence People emphasized this 90 years ago, but it still holds. Using someone’s name once or twice makes the conversation more personal. Overuse feels creepy. But “Nice meeting you, Sam” at the end of a chat sticks in their brain.

8. Make your goodbye memorable  

Most people focus on how to start a conversation, not how to end one. Always close with something memorable. “Hey, if you ever want to talk film recs again, I’m your person” or “Let’s finish that convo another time” gives them a hook to reconnect. Psychologically, the final 10 seconds of a convo matter more than the first 30.  

(Source: Peak-end rule, Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize-winning psychologist)

9. Practice in low-stakes zones  

Here’s a weird tip backed by social scientistsgrocery stores, elevators, and dog parks are the BEST training grounds for small talk. There’s low risk, short duration, and built-in context.

Now the good stuffapps and resources that helped me master this:

1. Big Talk app  

Created by Kalina Silverman (TED talk speaker), this app gives you deep conversation starters based on psychology. Way better than just “ice breakers.” Perfect for dates, coworkers, or even reconnecting with close friends. The best thing? It skips the small talk completely.

2. Gabby app  

One of the best interactive tools to improve your social fluency. It uses AI-driven prompts to prepare you for real-world chats. You can even choose scenariosfirst date, networking event, family gathering. Super helpful if you’re socially anxious.

3. BeFreed  

An AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University and ex-Google engineers, BeFreed turns expert-backed contentlike research papers, psychology books, and top podcastsinto personalized audio lessons. 

I use it to dive deeper into social psychology topics like emotional intelligence, charisma, and human connection. You can even customize the tone and voice of the lesson (my go-to is the calming late-night radio style). It’s like having a podcast host that knows exactly what you’re trying to improve and adapts each lesson as you go.  

Replaced most of my social media scrolling, and I’ve been communicating way clearer and more confidently since. No brainer for any lifelong learner. Just use it and thank me later.

4. The Art of Charm – Podcast  

Legendary podcast that interviews behavioral scientists, military interrogators, and communication pros. Episode rec: “How to Connect with Anyone” featuring Vanessa Van Edwards. Concrete takeaways, no fluff.

5. YouTube channel: Charisma on Command  

This guy breaks down how celebrities like Obama, Zendaya, and Keanu Reeves win people over instantly. Watch the breakdowns and steal their techniques. One video on Tom Holland made me completely rethink how pacing and tone work in conversations.

6. Book: Captivate by Vanessa Van Edwards  

This book changed how I approach every room. Vanessa is a behavioral researcher and founder of Science of People. She decoded what makes people instantly likable, using real data. Each chapter is like a conversation cheat code. This book will make you question everything you think you know about charisma. Insanely good read.

7. Book: Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell  

This bestseller unpacks why we constantly misread peopleand how to fix it. Gladwell tells real stories that show how assumptions ruin communication. It made me rethink how I judge people in the first 30 seconds. This is the best book I’ve ever read about how small talk often masks huge misunderstandings.

8. Book: How to Talk to Anyone by Leil Lowndes  

This is a classic for a reason. She gives 92 tiny tricks you can use in any convo. Sounds basic, but trust meit’s like social jiu-jitsu. Want to nail first impressions and end awkward silences forever? Start here.

9. Podcast: Hidden Brain – “You 2.0: The Chemistry of Trust”  

Neuroscience meets real-world connection. This episode explains how your body and brain decide who to trust in the first 5 seconds. It’s surprisingly emotional.

This stuff isn’t about faking it. It’s about making human contact more intentional. Small talk doesn’t need to be painful. You just need better tools. Once you have them, people start responding differently. They open up. They want to talk. And you stop dreading conversations with strangers.

The community's response was amazing.

Since then, I've been trying to fix my Retention. I realized that while Digital (Obsidian) is king for storage and linking, it was actually hurting me during the learning/encoding phase.

I wanted to share my experience with ""The Metacognitive Illusion"" the trap of thinking that because your digital notes look clean, you have actually learned the material.

# The Great Unlearning 

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad Magic Keyboard ( ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case). After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting. My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation. A mountain of dense, merciless theory. Aerodynamics, engines, electrical systems, all crammed into thousands of pages. And in aviation, almost knowing is the same as not knowing. You can’t “guess” how an aircraft system works at 35,000 feet. 

And here’s the terrifying part: the knowledge wasn’t sticking. 

On the iPad, everything felt neat, but hollow. I could read for hours, scroll through PDFs, highlight in neon colors… and yet, the next morning, it was as if I’d done nothing. The learning slid off my brain like water on glass. 

It was the strangest, most unsettling feeling. I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because the very tool I had trusted was betraying me. 

I was heading toward what I now call a cognitive nosedive: all systems looking functional, but the aircraft (my brain) losing altitude fast. 

That’s when I snapped. 

I did something absurd. 

I took my thousand-page PDFs, walked into a print shop, and said: “Print it all.” 

# The Homecoming

The printer groaned and clattered, spitting out stack after stack of warm A4 paper. The shopkeeper looked at me like I was insane. Honestly? I felt insane.. Here I was, the proud owner of a futuristic $1000 iPad, paying extra money to drag myself backwards into the past. 

But then I picked up the first heavy stack. I opened the first page. I pulled out a simple ballpoint pen. And I underlined. 

# The Uncomfortable Truth

I eventually passed my exams, but I realized the iPad was a ""Distraction Engine"" that was fracturing my focus. I needed something in between the ""dumbness"" of paper and the ""distraction"" of an LED screen.

I realized that for deep encoding (especially for Pilot exams), I needed the friction of paper. I'm now testing a hybrid workflow: **Analog for Learning -> Digital for Archiving.**

Curious how you guys handle the ""Capture"" phase? do you write directly into Obsidian, or do you draft on paper first to get the ""friction"" benefits?
