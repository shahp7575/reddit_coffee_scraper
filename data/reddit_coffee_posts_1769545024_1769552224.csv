1qosgto,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkArchive/comments/1qosgto/my_friend_wanted_proof_the_ghost_town_was_haunted/,My Friend Wanted Proof the Ghost Town Was Haunted. We Found Something Worse.,"I didn’t go because I believe in ghosts.

I went because my friend wouldn’t stop talking about “the town.”

He said it the way people say the mall, the diner, the spot. Like everyone’s supposed to know. Like it’s a rite of passage if you live within driving distance of the mountains.

“It’s not even that far,” he told me for the third time that week, leaning on my passenger window while I was trying to pump gas. “Old mining town. Abandoned. Still has stuff left behind. Tools. Cans. Maybe signs. And it’s supposed to be haunted.”

I made a face. “Haunted by what. Miners with pickaxes?”

He grinned like I’d walked into it. “Exactly.”

He was the kind of guy who could make you say yes to things without trying that hard. Not in a manipulative way. More like… he’d already decided it was going to be fun, and you didn’t want to be the person who wasn’t fun.

Also, if I’m being honest, I’d had a rough month. Too much screen time, too many nights falling asleep with my phone on my chest, the usual modern rot. A day in the mountains sounded like a reset.

So on a Saturday morning, we met up with coffee and a cheap breakfast sandwich, and we drove.

The last stretch was gravel road and patches of snow in the shade even though it was spring. The kind of road that makes your car sound like it’s complaining. The kind of place where you pass one rusted “NO SERVICES” sign and you start doing mental math on how far you are from cell signal.

He had the directions on his phone, but when it dropped to no bars he didn’t even blink. He’d printed a screenshot like it was 2009.

“See?” he said, tapping the paper. “We’re basically there.”

The abandoned town wasn’t marked with a sign. There was just a break in the trees where the road widened into a flat, rocky area—like a turnout that used to be a parking lot before the forest decided it wanted it back.

From there, you could see it: low shapes half-swallowed by brush, collapsed roofs, the dull angle of a corrugated metal building, a line of poles that used to carry power but now just stood there like dead matchsticks.

It didn’t look haunted.

It looked forgotten.

We parked and stepped out. The air was cold enough to bite your ears, but the sun had that bright, clean mountain glare. Everything smelled like pine and damp earth, and somewhere far off there was running water.

He hopped around the car, already excited, like we’d just rolled up to an amusement park.

“You ready?” he asked.

“I’m ready to be disappointed,” I said, and he laughed.

We started in what used to be the main strip, if you could call it that. A dirt road cutting between a handful of buildings. Most of them were just frames now. Weathered boards, broken windows, doors hanging from one hinge.

There were old goods, technically. Empty tin cans. Rusted nails. A cracked wash basin. An iron stove with its door open like a jaw.

He kept pointing things out like artifacts. “Look at this—branding iron. Old bottles. Dude, that’s a ledger.”

He was right about the ledger. It was wedged in a drawer that had half-fallen out of a desk inside one of the buildings. The pages were swollen from moisture. The ink had bled into soft lines.

He didn’t touch it. He just leaned in and took pictures, like he knew the unspoken rule: take only photos.

That’s when he mentioned the hiker.

He did it casually, like he’d been holding it back until the mood was right.

“You heard about that guy that went missing?” he asked.

I glanced at him. “What guy.”

He tucked his phone away and lowered his voice, like the trees might listen. “Last summer. Hiker went off-trail near here. They did a search. Dogs and everything. Nothing. People online said he’d been posting photos, like… ‘I found a ghost town,’ stuff like that.”

I snorted. “People go missing in the woods all the time.”

“Yeah,” he said, and his tone shifted a little. Less excited. “But this one was close enough to this place that—”

“That you wanna LARP as a rescue mission,” I finished.

He smiled, but it didn’t quite land. “I just wanna see if it’s real. Like… if there’s anything here. Any sign someone’s been camping or—”

“Or you wanna be the guy who finds the spooky clue,” I said.

He held up his hands. “Okay, yeah. Maybe.”

We kept moving.

There was a general store with the front wall mostly gone. Inside, shelves were tipped over. A cash register sat on the floor, half-buried in dust and mouse droppings. The glass display cases had been shattered long ago.

As we walked through, I felt that quiet pressure you get in places that used to hold a lot of voices. Like the air remembers.

Then I saw something that made me stop.

A handprint.

Not on a wall. On a pane of glass still clinging to a window frame. Dust-covered, but the print was clean, as if someone had pressed their palm there recently.

Five fingers. Normal size. A smear at the base, like someone slid their hand downward.

“Hey,” I said. “That—”

My friend leaned in. “Sick. Someone’s been here.”

“Recently,” I added.

He shrugged like that didn’t matter. “People explore. That’s the point.”

We moved on, and I told myself not to start doing that thing where my brain manufactures a threat because it wants the story to be better.

But then I saw the first thing that didn’t fit.

It was just a flicker in my peripheral vision. To the left, between two buildings, deep in the shadow.

It looked like… fingers.

Longer than they should’ve been.

And dark at the tips, like they were stained.

I turned my head fast and saw nothing.

Just a slat of broken fence and brush and a hanging strip of cloth that might’ve been part of a curtain.

“You good?” my friend asked.

“Thought I saw something,” I said.

“A bear?” he said, sounding excited again.

“No,” I said, because the word bear didn’t match what my body had done. My body hadn’t gone “predator.”

It had gone wrong.

We kept walking, and I kept glancing at the gaps between buildings like I’d left something behind.

We found the school after about twenty minutes, farther down the dirt road where the town thinned out. It was a low building with a collapsed roof on one side and a busted bell tower that leaned at an angle that made me want to step away from it.

The front doors were gone. Inside, the hallway was open to the sky in places where the roof had caved. Sunlight fell in hard rectangles on the floor.

We walked in anyway, because curiosity is a disease.

There were old desks—some stacked, some broken. A chalkboard still clung to one wall, stained and blank. A row of hooks for coats. Someone had painted a faded alphabet above them.

It felt like the kind of place that should’ve had kids’ voices, and not having them made the silence heavy.

We sat outside the school on the broken front steps to drink water and snack. He pulled out his phone and started taking pictures like it was a tourist stop.

“Hold up,” he said. “Get in one.”

“No,” I said. “I’m not posing in front of a haunted school.”

“It’s not haunted,” he said, smiling. “It’s history.”

I rolled my eyes and stood anyway, because he wasn’t going to let it go.

He stepped back and framed the shot. “Okay, look just past me. Like you’re thinking about how sad it is.”

“Shut up,” I said, but I did it.

He snapped a couple photos. Then he did one of us together, leaning in with his arm around my shoulder, both of us grinning like idiots.

“Perfect,” he said, scrolling.

Then his smile faded slightly.

“What?” I asked.

He turned the screen toward me.

At first I didn’t see it. Just us, the school behind us, the hallway dark.

Then I saw the two white dots.

They were in the background, deep in the hallway darkness, symmetrical like eyes. Not reflective like animal eyes that catch a flash. These looked like they were lit from inside. Clean white circles, too round.

My throat tightened.

“Probably a raccoon,” my friend said quickly.

“In a school hallway,” I said.

“They’ll go anywhere,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself. He tapped the screen, zoomed in, and the image blurred. The dots stayed.

“Maybe it’s dust,” he said. “Or like, lens flare.”

“It’s in the shadow,” I said.

He locked his phone and shoved it into his pocket with too much force. “Okay. So we leave. Happy?”

I was about to say yes—yes, let’s leave, let’s go back to the car and pretend this was just a creepy photo—when I heard it.

Not a scream.

A sound like crying.

Soft, broken, like someone trying to breathe through it.

It came from deeper in the town, beyond the school, where the trees were thicker and the buildings were less intact.

My friend froze, mid-step.

We looked at each other.

“Did you—” he started.

The crying stopped.

The silence that followed felt… staged. Like someone had turned the sound off.

Then we heard it again, farther away. Softer. Like it was moving, or like it wanted us to think it was.

My friend swallowed. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, we’re leaving.”

We started walking back toward the main strip, fast but not running. Running would’ve felt like admitting we were scared, and pride is another disease.

As we walked, I kept catching glimpses of movement at the edge of the buildings. Not clear shapes. Just a shift. A shadow that didn’t line up with the sun.

Then we heard something else.

A scream—this time not a woman. It sounded like pain. Like a person being hurt.

It was short and jagged, cut off abruptly, like someone had been grabbed mid-sound.

My friend stopped and turned his head like he was trying to triangulate it. “That’s… that’s not—”

“It’s not real,” I said, but it came out weak.

Because the scream had sounded real in the way your brain recognizes whether something is performed or not.

My friend’s hand went to his pocket like he was checking his phone. No signal, obviously, but he did it anyway. “We should call—”

“Later,” I said. “Get to the car.”

We hit the general store again, and I saw something that made my blood go cold.

The clean handprint on the glass was gone.

Not smeared.

Gone like the dust had been disturbed over it, wiped away.

As if someone didn’t want us staring at it anymore.

I kept walking.

We rounded a corner between two buildings and I saw it again—this time not just fingers.

A hand, fully, gripping the edge of a wall.

Long knuckles. Pale skin, almost gray in the shadow.

And the nails—

They looked like claws. Not sharp like a cat’s. Thick and cracked, dark at the tips like dried blood.

I saw it for less than a second.

Then it withdrew.

I stopped so hard my friend almost bumped into me. “Did you see that?”

He looked at me, eyes wide. “Yeah.”

That was all he said.

That “yeah” had weight.

We didn’t talk after that. We just walked faster, trying not to look like we were running, even though every nerve in my body wanted to explode into sprinting.

The crying started again behind us.

Closer.

Not loud. Just persistent. Like it was following at a pace that didn’t require effort.

We passed the school again and I looked into the hallway without wanting to.

The two white dots weren’t there.

The hallway was darker than it should’ve been for this time of day, like the light had drained out of it.

I could smell something faint and sour—like wet pennies, like meat left too long.

My friend whispered, “Don’t look.”

We walked.

We walked.

Then the town went quiet in a new way, like even the wind stopped moving through the gaps in the buildings. The silence pressed in so hard it made my ears ring.

And then I heard footsteps behind us.

Not ours.

Not crunching like boots on gravel.

More like something dragging its weight through dirt, then pausing. Like it was listening.

My friend’s breathing changed. He glanced over his shoulder and didn’t slow down, but his whole body tightened.

“Don’t,” I whispered.

“I have to know,” he whispered back.

He looked over his shoulder again.

Whatever he saw made his face drain.

He didn’t scream. He didn’t swear. He just whispered, “Oh my god.”

Then he ran.

He broke into a full sprint, and my body followed before my brain caught up, because when the person next to you bolts, your survival instinct doesn’t ask questions.

We ran toward the turnout where the car was parked. The path wasn’t straight. We had to weave between buildings and brush and fallen beams.

Behind us, the crying became a sound I can’t describe without my stomach turning.

It wasn’t crying anymore.

It was something mimicking crying, like it had learned the shape of that sound but not the meaning. It turned into a wet, breathy thing with these little jerky breaks, like laughter trying to be sorrow.

Then, above it, that screech.

The same kind of screech you hear in horror movies and roll your eyes at because it’s too much.

In real life, it’s not “too much.”

It’s too true.

My foot caught on a piece of wood and I stumbled, catching myself before I fell. My friend was ahead of me now, maybe fifteen feet. He was looking back, running blind.

“Don’t look!” I yelled.

He looked anyway.

That’s when it hit him.

It didn’t pounce like an animal. It didn’t tackle him like a person.

It came out of the gap between buildings like it unfolded from the shadow, and it moved with this awful smooth speed, like it didn’t have to obey the same rules of momentum we do.

My friend went down hard.

He hit the dirt on his side and rolled, trying to scramble up, his hands flailing for purchase.

He screamed then—one sharp, shocked sound.

I stopped, because my brain did the stupid heroic thing where it tries to rewrite the ending.

I ran toward him.

I saw the creature, full, for the first time.

It looked like an emaciated deer, but not in any way that felt natural. No fur. Skin stretched tight over bone, pale gray like old ash. Its spine and ribs were too visible, like it had been starving for years. Its legs were long and jointed wrong in places, and its hooves—if they were hooves—were split and cracked like they’d been forced into shape.

Its head was the worst part.

It was deer-like in outline, but the face was wrong. The muzzle looked peeled back, too much bone showing. The mouth opened wider than it should have, not full of neat teeth, but jagged, uneven teeth like broken glass set into gum.

And the eyes.

Not animal eyes.

Those two white dots I saw in the photo weren’t reflections. They were the thing’s eyes, and they were blank and bright like dropped coins.

It looked at me and held my gaze for a second too long.

Like it was deciding if I was worth the effort.

I shouted. I don’t even remember what I shouted. Something useless.

It didn’t flinch.

It snapped its head toward my friend, who was trying to crawl backward on his elbows.

Then it moved again.

One fast step.

A blur of pale limbs.

My friend’s scream turned into a sound of pain that cut off halfway through like someone had shut a door on it.

I saw his legs kick once. Twice.

Then nothing.

I stood there frozen, my brain refusing to accept that the person I’d eaten breakfast with an hour ago was suddenly… gone in the most final way.

The creature’s head turned back to me.

It tilted, like it was curious.

And then it came for me.

I ran.

I ran so hard I couldn’t feel my lungs. I ran like the ground was pulling away under my feet. I ran toward the turnout, toward the car, toward any place that wasn’t behind me.

Something hit my back.

Not a full body slam.

Just the tips of those claws raking across me like it was testing how deep it could cut.

Pain exploded across my shoulder blades. Hot and tearing. It stole my breath and made my vision blur.

I stumbled but didn’t fall. I kept running.

I heard the creature behind me—its footsteps didn’t sound like hooves. They sounded like wet wood snapping.

I made it to the turnout and saw the car like a miracle, parked where we left it. Sunlight hit the windshield and for a stupid second it looked normal, like this could still be a story about exploring an old mining town and laughing about a creepy photo later.

I fumbled the keys out with shaking hands.

I hit the unlock button. The car beeped.

I yanked the driver’s door open and dove in.

My friend—his seat—was empty, the way it should be, and that made my throat tighten because it shouldn’t be.

I slammed the door, shoved the key into the ignition, and turned.

The engine coughed once, like it was offended at being asked to work.

Then it started.

I threw the car into reverse without looking and backed up hard enough that gravel sprayed. The tires spun, then caught.

As I swung the car around, I looked up.

The creature stood at the edge of the turnout, half in the trees. It wasn’t charging the car. It wasn’t frantic.

It was watching.

Its ribs rose and fell slowly, like it had all the time in the world. Like it could wait for me to make a mistake. Like it knew roads didn’t matter as much as people think.

Then it opened its mouth.

And the sound it made wasn’t a screech this time.

It was a sob.

A perfect sob.

A human one.

The same type of broken cry I’d heard earlier.

It came out of that mouth like a practiced line.

I hit the gas so hard my foot cramped.

The car lurched forward and I tore down the gravel road, bouncing over ruts, not caring what it did to my suspension. My back burned with every movement, and when I lifted my shirt at the first straightaway, my fingers came away wet.

Blood.

I drove until I hit cell signal and didn’t even realize I’d been holding my breath the whole time until my phone chimed with a notification like it had just woken up.

I pulled over and called 911 so fast I fumbled the digits.

When the operator answered, my voice came out wrong—too high, too tight.

I told them where we were. I told them my friend was gone. I told them something attacked us and I knew how it sounded and I didn’t care.

They asked what the attacker looked like.

I said, “Like a deer,” and I hated myself for it, because it sounded insane.

But then I added, “No fur. Gray skin. Wrong mouth. Eyes like… like headlights.”

I heard the change in the operator’s breathing. That moment when someone is trying to stay professional while their brain goes “what.”

They said deputies were on the way. Search and rescue, too.

I sat on the side of the road with my shirt pressed to my back, shaking, watching the tree line like it could step out anywhere.

Hours later, a deputy took my statement and an EMT cleaned and bandaged the claw marks. Four long cuts across my upper back. Not deep enough to kill me. Deep enough to prove I wasn’t just making it up.

Search and rescue went out there that afternoon.

They didn’t find my friend.

They found the town, of course. They found our footprints. They found the school.

They found the spot where he went down.

There was blood.

There were drag marks.

Then the drag marks stopped in a patch of brush like the earth had swallowed him.

They also told me something else, quietly, like they didn’t want me to hear it.

There was a missing hiker report near that town. More than one, if you went back far enough. People who stepped off trail. People who followed a sound. People who went looking for “a place.”

I asked if they thought the mining town had anything to do with it.

The deputy didn’t answer directly. He just looked at me for a long second and said, “Don’t go back.”

I haven’t.

But sometimes, when my phone shows me old photos the way it likes to—little “memories” it thinks I want—I see that school picture again.

And I zoom in.

And I look at the two white dots in the dark.

And I think about how my friend said, Probably a raccoon.

And I think about how fast “probably” becomes “too late” out there.

Because the last thing that creature did—before I hit the gas and left my friend behind in that town—was cry like a person.

Not because it was sad.

Because it knew it worked.",1,1769552028.0,TheDarkArchive,0,1.0,False

I met her at 17 when she instead of going to HS, lived with her bum bf and his family doing drugs in his bedroom all day. Her mom would talk w her and send her money bc ofc my friend didn't work, and neither did he. By some grace of God, they broke up and she moved back home. She got her HS diploma online and even worked for like 2 years before covid hit and she got let go. She did go to college on res shortly after in 2019, but after a semester she moved back home bc it was getting too hard. In 2022, we moved out tg and I really thought when we'd move out she would get a job and start doing productive things, but instead she was using her covid gov money, and then when that ran out, her mom paid her rent! 

Let me add that I also have major resentment bc even living tg, we never went out or did anything. She would sleep into 12 and by the time she did her ""morning routine"", it was like 3pm and shes in her pjs. I fear she basically had and still has, agoraphobia. I had it too back when covid was at its peak, but bc I was still in school and had a job running around, I got super good with anxiety and just overall I grew up since 2019 lol. After the year we lived tg, she moved back home. Year later she decided to go back to college and ofc the course had prerequisites that she was missing from grade 12, she only had to redo 3 courses .... 3 years later she still hasnt completed it. 

I've communicated in the past while we living tg how our dynamic has even shifted since we legit just stay in her room doing fuck all. We're SO young and she gets so overwhelmed even going outside to get coffee. Shes my only friend and I don't even have a friend tbh. We cant even talk about my life bc I can tell it stresses her that shes not doing anything, but wont do anything about it. She wont even ask about my life tbh and if i bring her life up genuinely, she thinks im acting like her mom lmao.

1qosecb,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qosecb/upgrade_time/,Upgrade time?,"Curious question for you brilliant lot, but maybe it’s been asked and answered a thousand times?… Idk 🤷‍♂️… new year new question stance here…

So I have a Gaggia Classic with an Auber PID. It’s chugging along just fine. I recently upgraded my grinder to a Eureka Mignon Libra from a DF64, and honestly it brought the machine to life. The past few weeks I have undoubtedly had the best shots I’ve ever had from the machine. I’ve had the machine for about two years. It’s been fine, but not spectacular…. No real issues to speak of aside from needing a gasket and the ever annoying dripping steam wand, that I mostly try to ignore. 

I recently moved and moved my coffee corner from my office to my kitchen then upgraded my grinder. The grinder now looks awesome in the kitchen, and I kind of want my machine to look awesome as well… sorry the plain SS with a PID attached to the side of the classic is not sexy… sooo anyway. I’m looking for a small footprint machine that looks great and performers even better, it needs to justify the cost of upgrading from what is a really capable machine. 

I like the Appartmento a lot. the Bello has popped up a ton since I’ve been poking around sites looking at their offerings. It has a similar appearance, and I think performance (mostly??). Even the Mara X is mostly good looking, but I don’t know how much of a performance gain I’d get. The only performance gain things I’d really like would be 1- reducing time to steam and 2- no more dripping steam wand. 

So question to you guys… if you didn’t have to upgrade, but kind of wanted to, and your wife would likely kill you for spending another couple grand on a machine when you just spent one on a grinder and your machine definitely works, what would you do? 

Would you upgrade at all? 

Would you upgrade to one of those three?

If none of those three, what machine would make a ton of sense? 

I mostly make milk drinks. Usually only one per day, but sometimes a second hours later, and on rare occasions we’ll entertain and I may make a couple for guests. The entertaining is infrequent enough that temperature surfing and redoing the whole workflow with the Gaggia has not been a real pain point.  ",2,1769551877.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I’m on an eSIM I activated before landing (picked it through one of those reseller platforms, it says it uses Spark as the underlying carrier). It’s been okay-ish in cities, but honestly... I was kinda surprised how quickly the signal dropped off once you get even slightly rural. Napier to Taupō? Dead zones for miles.

I know NZ has a lot of terrain, but I wasn’t expecting to lose connection this often. I don’t need full bars everywhere, just enough to load Google Maps and send a few messages. But sometimes even that’s a stretch.

So i'm keep curious:

If you're using a local SIM (2degrees? One NZ?), does it feel more stable?

Has anyone used eSIMs here that aren't Spark-backed?

And weird question, but has anyone tried using Starlink when amping?

The Most Expensive Item in Your Budget is ""Inaction"" 📉

We obsess over the price of a coffee, a subscription, or a flight to the Riviera Maya.
But we ignore the massive, compounding cost of waiting.

Waiting for the ""perfect"" market conditions.
Waiting for your boss to give you permission.
Waiting to feel ""ready"".

**Readiness is a Myth**

I learned this hopping between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The jungle grows whether you are watching it or not. 
It doesn't ask for permission. It just occupies space.

You don't get ready to launch a business. You launch the business to get ready.
You don't get fit to go to the gym. You go to the gym to get fit.

**The Compound Interest of Fear**

Every day you wait is a day of compound interest you are paying to your fears.
The market rewards speed, not perfection.
Your ""perfect plan"" is worthless if it stays in your head.

**The Challenge**

Stop checking the price tag on action. Start checking the price tag on inaction.
If you stay exactly where you are for the next 5 years, what is the cost?

Regret is the only bill you can't afford to pay.
Move. Now.

I used to drink plain espresso, but since then, I've been drinking mochas, since I have access to a steam wand now and the plain espresso wasn't very tasty with the cheap grinder.

I now have enough rewards points to purchase one of two (to four) grinders (located in Canada): 

* [Breville Smart Grinder™ Pro, Black Stainless Steel](https://rewards.airmiles.ca/product/237421) (Model: BCG820BST1BCA1)

* [Baratza Encore™ ESP Pro Coffee Grinder - Black](https://rewards.airmiles.ca/product/247712?locale=en-CA) (Model: ZCG595BLK1AUC1A)

These are the only options.  *Starving student has points, but not cash, for this frivolous upgrade.*

I'm attracted to one of the Breville models because they're the same brand as my machine and might be more likely to play well together, and I love the smart features.

But Baratza is also tempting, because I've heard the parts are replaceable, and I love how that increases the lifetime and reduces waste.  But I've also heard parts can be hard to get?

Durability and ease of use are important, I assume they both have the ability to perform similarly once I get them dialed in.  I don't want to have to buy a new machine within at least 5 years, if I can avoid it.

My main symptoms are air hunger (dyspnea) where I cannot get a satisfying lung breath at all and it gets stuck at some point, it is usually in combination with chest pain or pressure.

A bit of background: 
1. I have asthma
2. I used to have moments in my childhood where my body would just refuse to eat, I would feel really full after only a few bites or I just couldn't keep down food at all, episodes mostly lasting a day or 2 leading me to fast for the duration of the episodes.

When I was 17 I started smoking/taking copius amounts of nicotine. Between the age of 17 and now I got went to the ER 4 times due to ""asthma attacks"" that weren't responding to sabultamol. In October I got diagnosed with gastritis and had horrible reflux symptoms (10/10) because I was hitting every possible trigger in the book (think junk food and large volume every day) along with me getting food poisoning and not eating for 4-5 days.
Fast forward to 5 weeks later on ppis I eventually stopped abruptly after everything got better, leading me to be symptom free for 4 weeks until symptoms came back leading me to do an endoscopy and getting a diagnosis.

I am currently eating boiled eggs on toast, zwieback, bananas, oven chicken with no oil at all.
I have quit:
1. nicotine
2. alcohol
3. caffeine (coffee)

That has been my diet for 18 days now. My questions are: 

-Is this potentially chronic?

-Will I have to manage my symptoms forever and will my air hunger ever truly go away?

-Should I do any new tests to rule out the air hunger being anything else? (lungs fine, no heart issues, 
symptoms match up with flares)

I wanna live a normal care-free life again and I don't know if it's possible now. I really don't want to eat like this for the rest of my life. What do I even do?",1,1769551310.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

It started with a simple idea. I needed an activity tracker that adapted to my life, rather than forcing pre-configured ""billionaire"" habits on me. I wanted a minimalist tool without the noise, and most importantly, I wanted complete privacy. My goal was to ensure data stays on the device, rather than being harvested to train AI models.

That is how Purpose was born. Coming from a software engineering background, mobile development was a new challenge for me. The android specs were news to me, a lot of requirements and processes, and the challenge was using documentation from 2 years ago as the latest (yes that one with a gray logo 😂 ).

Getting production access required finding 12 testers for 14 days; after targeting specific communities and navigating two failed attempts (reason: not enough testers), I finally launched (with a group of testers of 23 people testing the app). I have since introduced a small subscription for advanced features, priced lower than a cup of coffee.

Purpose now have more than 500 monthly active users, more than 20% of them are pro users, I'm glad of their trust, and I'm bound morally more than anything to provide a solution that matters.

As I continue to develop the application, I would love to hear your thoughts. Honest feedback is incredibly valuable to me, especially to counterbalance spam ratings 😕.

Additionally, if you are a fellow developer working on your own idea and need advice, please reach out. I would be more than happy to share what I’ve learned.

1qos3mr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qos3mr,"Capella Sydney Review (Amex FHR) — Two Nights, January","Dates: Jan 25–27

Nights: 2

Booking: Amex FHR (cash)

Room booked: Deluxe King

Room received: Premier King

Total cost: USD \~$1,470 all-in (≈ $133 taxes/fees)

Early check-in: \~1:30 pm

Late check-out: 4 pm (FHR)

**TL;DR**

Capella Sydney is one of the most comfortable city luxury hotels I’ve stayed at. Calm, design-forward, excellent food, and outstanding value via Amex FHR. After walking through the Park Hyatt Sydney, I’m very glad I switched. For my priorities, it’s not even close.

⸻

**Arrival & Check-In**

Arrived via Uber from SYD. Luggage taken immediately, no fuss. Check-in handled on the ground floor.

The hotel opened in 2023 and feels it: modern but warm, with a light-filled central dining space under skylights and a large art installation. The mood is calm and controlled, not buzzy.

Check-in was efficient and friendly. Upgrade to Premier King was proactively explained, along with FHR benefits in writing. Welcome amenity was a tin of local chocolates, which were excellent.

Only minor issue: concierge had some difficulty locking in a restaurant reservation due to the Australia Day holiday. Not a big deal, but they could be more anticipatory with guest requests during peak periods.

⸻

**Room (Premier King)**

Room size is \~50 sqm / \~538 sq ft, which feels generous for a city hotel.

Design is muted and elegant: brown leathers, wood, marble, dark brass cabinetry, and a lot of tasteful art. It reads modern but not cold.

The bed was extremely comfortable. Likely a California King. High-quality linens, pillows that were neither too firm nor too soft. Slept exceptionally well.

Windows have automated sheers and blackout curtains with bedside controls. Storage is via an armoire rather than a true closet. No way to fully hide luggage, but drawers were sufficient for a short stay.

Bathroom is a light box: large walk-in shower, soaking tub, and water closet with textured glass. Some reviews complain the tub orientation eats space. I noticed it, but it didn’t bother me. Privacy is limited, which was fine for me.

Shower pressure and temperature control were excellent. One issue: the walk-in shower leaked water and required a towel at the door.

Amenities are Bamford. I mostly used my own products, but the hand soap was very good.

Noise insulation was excellent. Very quiet room.

Views are not the draw. Mine faced nearby CBD buildings. Curtains stayed mostly closed. This is a hotel for rest and recharge, not harbor views.

I had originally booked the Park Hyatt Sydney. After seeing it in person, I’m glad I switched. The Park Hyatt has iconic views, but many rooms feel like fishbowls facing heavy public foot traffic. During Australia Day crowds, Capella felt like a refuge.

⸻

**Housekeeping & In-Room Service**

All guest services are handled via an in-room iPad. Slight learning curve, but once understood, it worked very well.

Housekeeping was immaculate and consistent. I’d leave early due to jet lag and return mid-morning to a spotless room.

Turndown included closing curtains, high-quality slippers, bottled water, and a small nightly amenity.

Room service was excellent. Quoted 60 minutes, arrived in \~15. Service style was polite, efficient, and non-lingering. Trays were picked up quickly after.

Overall guest services operation was meticulous.

⸻

**Food & Beverage**

Breakfast is included via FHR and is a standout.

You can order à la carte or use the buffet. Quality of ingredients is very high. This is not a massive, chaotic buffet, but everything you actually want is there: excellent fruit, cold cuts, yogurt, breads, and plenty of healthy and vegetarian options. Quiet, peaceful dining room. Service is attentive but unobtrusive. Coffee was excellent.

Where Capella really shines is FHR food credit value.

Over two days I had:

	•	Arrival-day sashimi platter and mixed greens with furikake

	•	Caesar salad via room service

	•	Steamed fish in tomato consommé with zucchini

Total out-of-pocket beyond the room rate was \~AUD $63.

At many US luxury hotels, a single lunch or dinner would burn the entire credit. Here, the quality and portioning made the credit stretch far. Food quality was consistently strong across all meals.

I did not use the signature fine-dining restaurant. The all-day dining room was more than sufficient.

⸻

**Amenities & Public Spaces**

Did not use the pool, but it’s heavily advertised and visually impressive, with an adjacent hot tub.

Gym is large for a city hotel and never felt crowded. Proper free weights, machines, and cardio.

Spa facilities are excellent: dry sauna, steam room, and high-quality showers. Great post-workout circuit.

There’s a common area with an afternoon happy-hour-style offering. I don’t drink, but they had a thoughtful non-alcoholic champagne-style option and very good canapés. Space is consistent with the rest of the hotel: art-forward, quiet, refined.

Guest mix skewed toward two groups:

	•	Affluent East Asian Gen Z / millennial travelers

	•	American boomer luxury travelers, many clearly tied to ultra-luxury cruises (lots of Silversea hats)

Dining room also attracted well-dressed locals on business lunches, which gave the hotel a lived-in feel.

Importantly, the hotel never felt hectic. It felt calm and restorative, even on hot days and during peak season.

⸻

**Location**

Located in the CBD. Street level can feel quiet or even dead, which I didn’t mind.

About a 10-minute walk to Circular Quay, the Opera House, and the Harbour Bridge. Easy Uber access. Bondi requires a drive regardless of where you stay.

Close to high-end shopping if that matters.

Compared to the Park Hyatt Sydney, Capella is much calmer. The Park Hyatt sits directly in heavy tourist traffic and felt worn on walkthrough. Capella feels fresh and noticeably better value.

⸻

**Verdict**

Capella Sydney is modern, understated, and exceptionally comfortable. Closest comp for me would be an urban St. Regis-tier hotel, but less stuffy and more restrained.

If your priorities are sleep quality, calm, excellent food, and value via FHR, this hotel is outstanding.

If you want balcony views of the Opera House and don’t mind crowds or paying a premium, the Park Hyatt makes sense. Otherwise, for me, Capella clearly dominates.

I would absolutely return.",1,1769551221.0,u_PrivilegedPoints,0,1.0,False

1qos258,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qos258/wendigos_arent_what_you_think/,Wendigos aren't what you think,"There’s a feeling you get when you’re out in a holler at night. Trees rising up around you like the great teeth of some ancient being. A feeling of hopelessness, loneliness at how small you are. But also, a fundamental sense that you are a part of it all. It’s overwhelming and in that moment you can feel God. It’s been years since I’ve got out in the woods again. I miss it. Ache for it. But I worry about what will happen if I go back out there. 

 

I’d heard tales of the witikow from Cree boys I’d go fishing with. Monster men who succumbed to the sin of gluttony and placed their own survival over that of the community. It was a spirit, they said, an old and evil spirit that crawled into men. It was the kind of scary story shared amongst young boys playing at being men. A chance to boast of how you’d slay such a beast; a lesson taught on how to avoid becoming one. 

 

It was in the winter of ’88-’89 that I encountered a witikow, or what most folk now call wendigo. I was camping with my brother Nate and our friend Takwakin. It was before the first snow and we had been amongst the trees for a week, living off of the land. We were each of us skilled enough at hunting, Nate and I eager to test out our new rifles. But game alone isn’t enough and so we foraged too. I don’t see colors right, so the foraging fell to Nate and Takwakin. 

 

So it was that I would check and gather the snares each morning while they broke camp, and each day we stopped I would set camp while they foraged. It was a carefree time whenever we went roaming in the woods. Not easy, but simple and without the complexities of society. We had each other for company and though there were times there was want of a woman, this was easily dealt with by a quick trip alone to the river. 

 

Nights were the domain of stories. We would sit out amongst the moon and stars and take turns telling the stories of our youth. Takwakin’s were my favourite, for I hadn’t heard their like before. Nate's were well old and familiar, bringing comfort in repetition. I had no craft at speaking. Felt like words got caught in my throat and tied my tongue up. They didn’t mock me, though, not like the other boys back in town. 

 

A full moon shone overhead on a perfect cloudless night and Takwakin drew our attention to it. “You know there’s a rabbit up there?” He asked, his breath frosting and the hints of a smile playing on his face. Nate and I laughed.

 

“No, I’m serious.” He said, still smiling. “There was a rabbit who wanted to go to the moon, so he asked all the birds in the land to take him. He asked the jay, but jay-bird said ‘I am too small to carry you’.

 

“So, he asked the goose, for it was larger than the jay and could support his weight, but the goose too said no. ‘It is too cold up so high’ the goose said ‘Already I fly from place to place to avoid such cold. I will not fly to that cold rock'.

 

“At this the poor rabbit had lost hope that he would ever touch the moon. But brother crane had heard the rabbit’s pleading. He was strong and not afraid of the cold. ‘I will take you.’ He said ‘but you must hold tight to me, for it is a long fall if you let go.’” And with that Takwakin sat back and closed his eyes. Nate kicked his foot.

 

“Out with it.” Nate said.

 

“What?” Takwakin asked, smile growing.

 

“O-out w-with the rest!” I said.

 

“Y'ain't ever told a story that didn’t have no ending.” Nate said. We were both leaning forward now, the fire between us crackling encouragement to our plight. Takwakin delighted in our hanging on his word. Telling tales is what he loved most. Said it was a way of keeping alive what we otherwise lost.

 

“Fine, fine, if that is not enough.” He relented. He sat up again and the light of the fire danced in his eyes. “The rabbit hopped onto brother crane’s feet and wrapped his paws as tightly around his legs as he could. So tight the scales dug into his soft skin. And the crane took flight. 

 

“It is a long way from here to the moon, and very cold and so the crane flew as fast as he could. So fast that poor rabbit nearly slipped and fell away, so he clutched tighter. But the ground didn’t want to part with the rabbit and greedily pulled him back down, but still the rabbit held on. So tight the crane's short legs got stretched and stretched. 

 

“Finally they made it to the moon and rabbit, breathless from the journey, patted crane's head in thanks. But, rabbit had held so tight his paws were bloody and it left a mark on crane’s head. And this is why all cranes today have long legs and red marks on their head. A gift from the moon rabbit.” And with that he pointed out dark patches on the moon that looked like a rabbit. I went to sleep that night with thoughts of the moon rabbit. 

 

I awoke to a soft noise in the woods, whispering on the verge of hearing. A fellow fur trapper, more than likely, about his business before first light. But there was a smell too. An awful smell. Like someone had ripped the guts from a wolf and left them to steam in the snow. Predator guts stink different. It’s subtle, but you come to notice it after a while. A wrongness there more than in other creatures. A warning, maybe. I drifted off with memories of helping pa skin a whole pack of wolves down by the creek and a voice that might have been my pa's telling me to come outside. 

 

I awoke again to bustling activity. Takwakin was burying the remains of the fire and bundling his gear and share of skins. 

 

“C'mon, we need to leave this place.” He said, as much to me as to Nate.

 

“W-what about the t-traps?” I asked.

 

“Leave them. We’re heading back.” Takwakin said. I looked at Nate but he just shrugged. So we got to work packing up. 

 

We’d been snaking a path along the north side of the river, long and wide. A journey that had taken us seven days but could see as home in as little as two. And Takwakin was setting a pace to see it done. The sun rose high in the sky, but its warmth never reached the ground and before it reached its apex we had lost it in a blanket of white that heralded the coming snows. 

 

Nate had kept his peace far longer than I’d expected before the silence wore on him too deep and he had to pry. 

 

“What’s the hurry, what did you see?” He said, moving up to match Takwakin’s step, leaving me to hurry behind. Fat flakes of snow spiralled to the ground like manna from heaven. I stopped and caught some on my tongue like I had when I was still a young boy. When I looked ahead, I saw I was quickly being left behind and doubled my pace to catch up. 

 

“You’re fooling.” Nate was saying. “It was probably a trader with a fresh kill.”

 

“No, it was witikow. A Kihtehayah has the hand of one; it still lives. Claws and scratches to escape its confines. As children we are brought to see it. That we might know the signs of the witikow: their sight, their smell. It was witikow.” 

 

Nate stopped, allowing me to catch up. Takwakin had always spoken jokingly of the witikow; we had never heard of this hand before. I thought of that smell from last night. The voice, half-heard in my dream. Takwakin finally stopped too.

 

“Come on! It tracks us even now. We need to get back. Our only hope is in community.” Takwakin said and started moving again. Nate and I rushed after him.

 

“If it’s following us, why can’t we smell it?” Nate asked.

 

“When you stalk deer, do you approach upwind that it might notice you?” We walked in silence after that. Snow came down faster, settling heavily on the forest floor. Flakes whipped by in the corner of my vision, conjuring images of the witikow darting between trees after us. Twigs cracked in the distance, snow crunched, and the wind hissed and howled. Normal sounds of nature I’d grown up with turned blood curdling by Takwakin’s words.

 

It was before nightfall that we started setting up camp. Takwakin said it was dangerous to move at night. We’d build a big fire, stay together and have a weapons loaded and to hand.

 

“The witikow is a coward.” He said. “Strong enough in body to tear through ten men, but weak in heart. It fears being outnumbered. It wants to draw us apart. So we stick together.”  

 

We only had Remingtons calibered at .22, bought earlier in the year because Nate and I had been taken in by the store clerk’s patter about what a great invention it was. Takwakin had an old Winchester yellow boy, which was a .44 at least. I wasn’t convinced any would be effective against a witikow. 

 

We were in a holler we’d camped at on the way out. The fire raged in the middle of the camp, burning as high and bright as we could manage. We’d made a stash of firewood here on our way out, anticipating snowfall. The snow had stopped but still blanketed everything, making the trees look even more like giant teeth and the fire a lapping tongue. 

 

Sleep did not come easily to any of us as we sat around the fire, cradling our rifles. Fear burned in my veins, but like the fire it could only burn so bright for so long. I drifted. 

 

A scream pierced the night and I jolted awake, gripping my gun tighter. The noise was high and soul shredding. The sound of imminent death and helplessness. My heart stopped in my chest as my eyes darted around for the source. I could see Nate and Takwakin doing likewise. Then the begging started.

 

“Nate!” The voice was so high and pained. Filled with fear and anguish. It took me a moment to realise I knew the voice. It was the voice of my mother. “Zeke! Help, oh sweet Jesus mercy!”

 

The sound of my name coming from my mother stirred my stomach and my bowels near gave out. I was frozen in terror. Mother was out in the woods with that thing. Nate, always the brave one, jumped to his feet and darted towards the screaming, but Takwakin tackled him.

 

“It’s not her.” He said, doing his best to keep Nate pinned. “The witikow takes voices.”

 

“How does it know what she sounds like?” Nate asked. Suddenly the fight went out of Takwakin and Nate was able to push him off. He pulled himself up and grabbed his gun from the drift it had fallen to.

 

“It already killed her.” Takwakin said. 

 

“Maybe.” Was all Nate said before he marched out into the darkness, rifle raised. We watched him disappear and did nothing. 

 

I don’t know how long we sat there, it could have been seconds, it could have been minutes before a shot rang out. The lightning crack was enough to set me off. I jumped to my feet.

 

“W-we have to go after him. S-stick together, y-yeah?” I said. Takwakin was still on his knees. He looked up at me and gave a slow nod. I helped him up and we walked shoulder to shoulder into the darkness after Nate. 

 

Each step was a shuffle forward, half-blind in the darkness but for the moonlight. The cold burned my hands and my trigger finger itched and shook in anticipation. 

 

“d-do you s-see anything?” I whispered. 

 

“I'm over here!” Nate shouted as if in response. It came from up ahead to our left. Then the explosion of a gun burst directly ahead of us. And another voice rang out.

 

“Liar!” This was also Nate's voice. Dead ahead. Takwakin and I both stopped. He gestured straight ahead; I nodded. We continued forward towards the source, guns now trained off to the left. 

 

A wet tearing sound suddenly filled the air and the smell of iron overran the decay. My brother howled like a dying dog and then another shot rang out and the witiko cried out in kind. A piercing sound, like an owl possessed by the devil. We rushed forward, dreading what we would find.

 

Nate lay against a tree, his body covered in the shining black of blood in moonlight. It poured freely from his chest and throat, steaming in the snow. I ran to him and held him tight. He was past saving and we all knew it. So, I hugged him and told him it was all OK and he’d be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven. I kept muttering to him even as his jerky breathing stopped and his body went limp against me. 

 

“Zeke, I’m sorry but he’s gone to his ancestors. We need to move.” Takwakin said, he was still scanning the trees for any signs of the witikow. “Zeke.”

 

I lay my brother down and my heart with him. I tried to wipe the tears from my eyes but only succeeded in getting blood on my face. Above me, the wind rustled a tree branch.

 

“Zeke move!” Takwakin cried and a shot rang out. A great weight dropped on me. Bones and sallow skin, reeking of death and far too heavy for what it was. The face was lolled by my side, so human and yet so inhuman, neck twisted at an impossible angle.

 

“Th-thanks.” I said, trying to pull myself out from under it. Takwakin pulled the lever on his rife, aimed and shot the thing again clean through the head.

 

“It’s not dead yet. We’ve got to melt its heart.” He said. He dropped his rifle and helped roll the beast off of me. As it rolled I felt a horrible pain spring from my stomach. I looked down to see blossoming black where my belly should be. The claws of one hand twitched wildly still, clasping and unclasping at a lump of flesh that used to be me. 

 

Between the sight and the pain it was too much. I threw up and felt my stomach rub against the ragged hole. 

 

“Think I’ll just lay here a while.” I said. “You go on ahead and burn the heart. I’ll catch you up.” Takwakin looked at me, at the wound, and nodded. He pulled a knife from his belt and cut the heart from the witikow, careful to stay clear of its twitching arms. He wrenched the heart out and it shone in the moonlight. 

 

“I’ll share your story.” Takwakin said. I nodded to him and he walked into the night. I knew when he’d burned the heart because the body spasmed violently and then was finally completely still. 

 

And in that stillness the shadow rose up.

 

It drifted like a black cloud from the witiko and hung over it. There were no eyes, no anything really, but it was watching me. I wish I could say that it overwhelmed me and claimed my body as its new home. That I could absolve myself of the guilt. Have my hands washed clean of sin. That is not how the demon works. 

 

It tugs at your mind, bringing some thoughts to sharp relief, while making others blur. I stared at the smoke of undeath and I realised I was not ready to die. That there was a way, a terrible way, I might yet survive. 

 

May the ever-merciful God redeem my soul, though I bare a greater sin than Cain. My teeth sank into my brother’s already torn throat and I drank his cooling blood like it was nectar. His flesh fell apart before my teeth like the finest steak and the shadow filled me. 

 

I ate of him until my stomach distended and still I was not sated. I tore the flesh from him by the handful and slid it down my gullet lost to all but the hunger. And then a smell caught my nose. The most mouth-watering smell. If this slab before me was leftovers from the icebox, then the smell was meat still on the pan, sizzling. 

 

Takwakin. There was such emotions battling on his face I do not know how one man may feel so much. Sadness, regret, hatred, betrayal, disgust. He battled to comprehend his mind and what he must do, but I was singular. There was only the hunger. 

 

My hands were on his throat in seconds, squeezing, squeezing. I think back on it now and hate myself for the unadulterated glee I had in that moment. And am overjoyed by the serendipity that followed. 

 

A rustle underfoot and the grey form of a rabbit bounded between the trees. I watched it in wonder, regaining a glimpse of myself. I released Takwakin, mercifully still alive. I tried to speak, but found I couldn’t. Strips that had once been my brother filled my oesophagus. 

 

Takwakin gasped for breath and looked at me. I can only imagine the conflict he felt then. I placed a bloody hand upon his head  and I ran into the woods. 

 

 

 

The change came on slowly. No matter how much I ate, or what I ate, I wasted away. Hunger clawed at me relentlessly and there was no respite in dreams for I could not sleep. The cold seeped into what remained of my skin until the fires of Hell couldn’t warm me. And as I ate, I grew. Limbs extending, stretching, cracking, breaking, healing. There was nought but pain and cold and hunger. 

 

I succumbed to it. I resisted for as long as I could, but the devil has an eternity with which to tempt. I ate of the flesh of men and still I was not sated. I was lost to the hunger, hidden by the cold. I wandered the woods for longer than I care to think. Until, one night I found myself once more in a holler. It wasn’t the one from my youth, but it awoke feelings that had long withered in me. I felt hopeless. I stared up at the full moon and saw in its shadows the rabbit, just as Takwakin had pointed out. I wept, icicles that carved at the flesh of my face and remembered that I was a man.

 

I found it easier to temper my hunger in crowds than around individuals. Some innate desire of the shadow to remain hidden? I do not know but I seized upon it. Where once I had secluded myself in the distant places, now I sheltered amidst concrete trees. There were still incidents, but they became more and more rare.  Each was confessed before God in the twilight hours at an empty church. 

 

Recent events have torn the veil from my eyes and exposed my hubris. I thought I had conquered the shadow  and could return to a semblance of normality. I decided it was time enough that I had a place of my own instead of wandering. I found an apartment. One so bathed in death that people stayed away from it and that is where I took up residence. There were six others on the ninth floor with me and 78 in total in the building. I knew the smell of each. Knew which order I would like to eat them in. The shadow pulled at my mind, bringing thoughts of how easy it would be to slip from room to room undetected. 

But I resisted. I sliced pieces of my own flesh off to consume instead. The meat was brittle as ice and fetid, but it helped the hunger. As much as anything helps the hunger. For I was stronger than the shadow and no longer would it be my master. 

 

The seed of my downfall came during the witching hour. I head a voice. A honeyed voice.

 

“Eat me.” It begged. I looked and beheld a man, slight, lean with just enough fat to add flavour. I was at him in an instant, all too eager to fulfil his ghastly request. Only, there was not joy in his eyes, but terror. 

 

It was the shadow, I realised. Clouding my mind, letting me here what it wanted, what it thought I wanted. God forgive me, I did want it. But I resisted. 

 

I returned to my room and I did not venture outside again for fear of what I may do. The shadow, though, it sang to me of sweet succour. During the day, with the bustle of the world beyond my window it was easy to set aside, but at night.

 

At night, the sound was all to welcome. And I could smell him even through the walls. One-pan. That was his name to me, for he smelled not just of the succulent flesh, but of a medley of flavours. Roasted potatoes and green beans, duck fat and onions, gravy and biscuits and a dozen other smells. A man who had been amongst the hot air of cooking foods for so long it had soaked into his skin. He had always been the one to eat first. 

 

I stood at his door most nights, breathing in the scent. My teeth chattering with anticipation. He heard me, I know he did, but I didn’t care. I needed to smell him; I wouldn’t taste him but I had to smell him. 

 

That was enough for me. For weeks it was enough. So, I pretended I was still in control. Pretended I couldn’t feel the shadow growing once more over my mind, clouding all that was not hunger. Then the neighbor broke me. I called him Pansawan because he smelled old and tough, blackened by smoke. Him I would have eaten last. 

 

Pansawan was a volcanic man, prone to going off for no reason. He often disturbed my peace. One night, while I savoured One-pan's scent, Pansawan erupted and slammed something, or possibly himself, hard against his cabinets. 

 

I retreated to my abode and listened as One-pan and Pansawan discussed the noise. Discussed me. Then Pansawan was approaching. I could smell the steel, gun oil, and black powder in his hands. A pistol, one that had seen many years of use. One that still smelled faintly of blood and brain. 

 

My mind went back to that day in the snow. To the damage Takwakin’s rifle had done to the witikow. Modern guns were much improved on those and I knew fear in that moment. The handle turned slowly and I braced myself for the end.

 

The shadow pounced then. It seized on my despair and carved away at everything else but it and the hunger. I pulled the door open and dragged Pansawan inside. It had been so long since I had feasted so fully. Sweet juice ran down my chin and I mopped it with my hands to lick clean. 

 

I do not know how long I spent picking over the bones, but I stirred at the sound of footsteps in the hall. New smells. Gun oil, old leather, starched cotton, stale coffee, and the second-hand smells of dozens of miscreants. Police.

 

It was a simple thing to slip from my window and climb around the outside of the building to Pansawan’s. I had practiced the move before, should I decide I did wish to indulge the shadow. 

 

The officers knocked and I answered. I was concerned my disturbing countenance may result in bloodshed, but they did not deign to look up from their notes. It was an easy thing to copy Pansawan’s voice and send them on their way. 

 

All the while, One-pan was standing just beyond his door, his scent filling me, awakening the shadow. I wouldn’t be safe while he lived. He knew about me. He would tell others. He had to die and if he were to die anyway, why shouldn’t I partake of his flesh. 

 

I tried to deceive him first, but it was unsuccessful. So, I attacked. I launched myself through the door at him and he fell onto the fire escape. 

 

He lay for a moment, panting and whimpering, speckled with blood. And in that moment I didn’t just smell him, I saw him. Truly saw him. A young man, cold and afraid, injured and desperate for help. I thought of Nate. I thought of Takwakin. 

 

One-pan scrambled away from me and I tried desperately to let him go. The shadow drew me onward. I fought it bitterly, reducing myself to sluggish, stuttering movements after him. Then he stopped. He’d reached the end of the line, a ladder he couldn’t get to drop. It didn’t matter how much I pressed against the shadow, we would reach him soon. 

 

I bore down on the helpless man. I wanted to say something, to apologise. But what good would an apology be to his suffering? It would only serve to assuage my guilt and I did not deserve it. He reached a hand in a feeble attempt to protect himself and the forearm spun and snapped easily in my grasp. 

 

My teeth brushed his throat and I felt the ladder pressing into me. The ladder. I damned my hunger and the shadow and pressed down on it with all my might. The ladder wailed and gave way, sending us both tumbling to the ground. 

 

I did my best to shelter him in the fall. My thin skin tore against the hard ground and I felt a dozen bones break. But he lived. A siren flashed and I dragged my body into the night. 

 

One-pan is alive, I made sure before leaving that city. I fear I will not be able to resist the shadow if I remain and so I am moving on once more. But I felt the need to share this with you, with everyone. The witikow, wendigo, isn’t what you think. It is a shadow waiting to claim the heart of any foolish enough to accept it. And at least one of us only seeks to live a peaceful life. ",1,1769551129.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,2,1.0,False

How can I prepare myself and get ready to move?,"Hey y’all! I’m slated to start an internship with IATSE Local 1 (the NYC local of the stagehands’ union- think theatrical sound, lighting, set construction, etc) in Q1 2027. I’m relocating from Raleigh NC. I have a year to prepare, budget, save some money, do my research; but I barely know where to start. I’m working at Starbucks right now and I’m hoping to move back in with my parents for the second half of 2026 to reduce my current expenses so I can save, but realistically I’ll be going into this with \~$5-10k in liquid savings at most.

I’m a 24 year old gay man with a lifelong dream of moving to NYC. I don’t want to fuck this up, and I want to go in with realistic expectations and financial stability.

Here’s the facts:

\- I won’t know the exact details of where I’m being placed until a month before I start.

\- Pay will be $24-34/hr depending on where exactly I get placed.

\- Hours: unknown. Most placements are 40hr/week but a few give slightly less. Some placements are 8-4 every weekday, others are mostly evenings and weekends. I’m not opposed to picking up a second job at a restaurant, coffee shop etc but I don’t want to count on that.

\- Location: almost all the placements are in Manhattan. Obviously I’d love to live in Manhattan but I realize that’ll be a stretch.

\- I’m totally fine with roommates, and I don’t expect to have a super high standard of living. I’ve mentally prepared myself for low-budget living 😅

\- The apprenticeship itself is roughly 2 years long, after which I’ll be a full union member able to keep working in the area (and hopefully able to make more money).

\##Questions:

\- What areas should I be looking at for housing?

\- Are there any resources for finding roommates? (I know I’m too far in advance right now)

\- Any tips? Things I should know? Resources? There’s so much I don’t know- I don’t have any personal friends living in NYC, just second- and third-hand connections, so I really don’t even know where to begin my research and prep! Ft",3,1769551088.0,movingtoNYC,1,1.0,False

Today I examined my machine further. It has a protuberance. Twist the knob and it turns into a hot…steamy…protuberance.

Stick it in in a tight wet container and you are supposed to get a white creamy substance…

Ahem.

Today I used the French press. Because what else are you going to do with the several overfilled pucks worth of freshly ground coffee you had to start over on the day before? And I wanted to do what 95% of others do with coffee grown in the most select regions at specific altitudes, roasted to perfection, ground with the finest engineered precision equipment and lovingly brewed with the finest equipment using scales and tools and ratios to extract the peak of flavor…

Obviously, drown it in milk.

So…on goes the machine. Steam…protuberance…heated and excess pre-cu…water removed. Into the pitcher goes the full fat organically grown milk pulled from only the finest hand picked cows raised on tender grasses in a picturesque meadow…or a dairy factory farm, the plastic bottle said “organic”. And into the milk goes the hot throbbing protuberance… which somehow seems backwards.

I mean, you’re just whipping milk into a froth with steam. I’ve watched videos from people named Lance…how hard can it be?

Well, turns out very. First of all, my protuberance is short and the lighting in my coffee “station” sucks. The first problem…I’ve been reassured it can get the job done because it’s how you use it. The second…clearly I need to go back on YouTube  and look up “Italian Espresso lighting fixtures”. I’m pretty sure it exists and has special coffee filtered light to make your chrome look even…chromier and not penetrate the coffee bags exposing the beans to light…which they grew in for months.

So, it’s steaming by Braile. Got it. You are supposed to hold it at the angle…just so…and stick just the tip in while it makes noises…then plunge it in deeper while feeling it until it gets hot. Sure. I think it’s swirling and it is growing and the pitcher got pretty darned  warm…but not too hot. Turned it off and I got hot milk. I don’t think I’m making art with that. Okay. More video watching.

Dump it into the slowly extracted coffee. My French press was wondering what the hell it should do with this fine powdery substance. But eventually I have a cup of black liquid and after tasting I added the milk. All of it. It’s…coffee,  questionable coffee with milk. What am I gonna do?

Well, obviously, add Ghirardelli chocolate powder because if you have questionable coffee and un frothy hot milk, the solution is to clearly make a mocha. Which was good.

My conclusions?

1. Lightning is important.
2. Chocolate makes everything better.",1,1769551054.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

everytime me and her hang out and talk all she talks about to me is her verbally abusive boyfriend. which i don’t mind her venting about at all, i am so supportive and always listen, but when i try to come to her about being heartbroken when this guy i was talking to cheated on me for example, she left me on read and texted me the next day completely ignoring what i said and was complaining about her boyfriend. it’s always like “ah that sucks. anyways listen to what he said to me yesterday”.

for her birthday last year i got her a gift and we went out. my birthday was in december and she didn’t get me anything and didnt even tell me happy birthday until the afternoon. but the next night she went out with her coworkers and she’s going to this huge valentines party with them next month, didn’t invite me but talks about it everyday. i understand i don’t work there so it wouldn’t make sense for me to go but for her to brag about going knowing i don’t have plans just kind of hurts?. she never asks me to go out with her on holidays like halloween, but she goes out with her coworkers to parties. she doesn’t even talk to them or hang out with them outside of work other than events. but everytime i try to go out with her she never does. it’s got to be an entire event planning session just to go get coffee. i’m not complaining that she didn’t get me anything, that’s not what it’s about at all. i just felt so looked over?

We ended up in similar lines of work so we’ve always stayed in pretty close – we were in each other’s wedding parties, etc. I’m trying to decide whether to end the friendship. 

He’s had a rough decade being in and out of treatment for alcohol addiction. He totalled his car and someone else’s but mostly has been annoyed at the consequences. His wife, who’s very pleasant, pulled most of the emotional, practical and financial weight in their marriage – and recently decided she couldn’t do that anymore. I don’t blame her – and she now seems to be doing much better, living without fear of what she’ll come home to in terms of his alcohol abuse. It wasn’t acrimonious at the time. 

But since, he’s behaved increasingly entitled and awful, scaring his ex by entering the apartment with a key he wasn’t meant to have (he moved out and is off the lease) and trying to control marital finances/refusing financial mediation. 

At the same time, our friendship has also involved (for several years now) mostly me providing emotional support and generally paying for any outings. He turns down any activities like sports or the movies and generally trauma-dumps while I pay for the coffee. In most close friendships, I would’ve brought up these concerns earlier but I never did because I didn’t want to kick him while he was down. He is currently receiving treatment.

That’s the context. I’m deciding whether to end the friendship; I’m horrified by his behaviour towards his ex and I just don’t think we have the same set of morals anymore. I don’t know who he is anymore and it seems like alcohol has affected his thinking over time. And beyond that, it feels like a one-sided friendship.

Out first date was on a Saturday and we were texting from the date until Wednesday. No conversation on Wednesday or Thursday so Friday afternoon I texted to confirm if we were still on for that night (our second date).

I finally implemented a robust Error Handling architecture (thanks to some advice from this sub):

1. The 'Safety Net': Every critical HTTP Request now has an 'Error Trigger' attached.

2. The 'Exponential Backoff': Instead of retrying immediately (and getting blocked), the workflow waits 1 min, then 5 mins, then 15 mins before retrying.

3. The 'Human Ping': If it fails 3 times, it sends me a Slack alert with the exact JSON error dump so I can fix it while drinking my morning coffee.

It’s simple logic, but my 'Uptime' went from 80% to 99%.

We ended up going on a first date for coffee. Decided to share lunch and go for a walk after because it was going well. Went to a farmers market and he insisted he wanted to buy something for me - a candle to I would think of him when I lit it. He stopped me in the middle of the sidewalk to kiss me and then again at my car when he walked me to it. Mentioned how he thought I was beautiful and easy to talk to. He did things like make sure we were waking in the sun because it was a little cold. He asked me to text him when I got home and immediately we scheduled a second date for the next weekend. Out first date was on a Saturday and we were texting from the date until Wednesday. No conversation on Wednesday or Thursday so Friday afternoon I texted to confirm if we were still on for that night (our second date). He let me know his aunt passed and her service was that week so he was feeling low energy and didn't want to be low energy with me. Of course let him know that was fine and I was there if he needed anything. Heard from him every day that week, granted some times it would take hours to reply. He asked to reschedule for that next Friday but let him know I had a flight that evening so we planned to hang out the night before AND that Friday night. He was going to take me to the airport and we would grab a small bite before on Friday and just dinner on Thursday. Thursday morning, he texts me to confirm our Thursday evening plans and then in the afternoon let me know he got news that bummed him out so could we just keep our plan before the airport the next day. I said sure and he let me know he would pick me up at 5:45. I have never heard from him again. I sent two text - one on Friday at 5:15 asking if it was safe to assume he was canceling and a second yesterday letting him know ghosting at our age is crazy and hurtful. I am 31, he is 33.

\-----

***And now, the continuation of Hell’s Kitchen…***

Up in the Black Jacket Lounge, everyone was still celebrating their achievements in making the Black Jacket portion of the competition, and Kara, in particular, said that it’s amazing she got so far; from having a shitty Signature Dish to making the Black Jackets, she’s one step closer to relocating herself down to Miami. Meanwhile, Rio poked Sierra a bit playfully by telling her not to drink too much tonight. Sierra laughed, albeit with a hint of sarcasm, saying she learned her lesson from the night before, but in her confessional, she says they’ll eat their words once she shows she’s got it, and she’ll make sure they practice ‘bending’ when she makes the finale. Moving on from that, Tem laments that it’s been one hell of a journey to get to this point, but she knows it’s not over yet, and Dani teases her a bit, telling her that it’s been a great one here, and it looks like now, they’re all set to be rivals. Kara points out that they’ve gotten quite close since their blowup some time ago (with a flashback of their fight after Service 4 being shown), but Tem says that’s water under the bridge now, and any kind of hurt they had made them a bit stronger. In her confessional, Tem says that it’s no secret there’s been plenty of bad blood she had with other teammates, whether it be Nicole or Ruben, but what she’s doing in rising above them is kinda doing wonders for her… Then again, she still has to deal with Sierra, and who knows how much of an enigma she’s going to turn out to be… 

Dani, Rio, and Freddie were sitting at a table, still jabbering about how they managed to get to the Black Jacket portion, with Rio saying that he didn’t think that he’d last another service after way earlier this competition, admitting that he didn’t take the competition a lot seriously, but after a lot of warnings from Ramsay, he had to stick something up there. Freddie patted him on the back, telling him that he has a great mindset going on, but Dani clarified that they all do; they just happen to have much better types than the rest of the fourteen chefs that lost out. In her confessional, she says she had a lot of doubts midway through the competition, and who knows; maybe she still has some, but she doesn’t want to waste this opportunity that might make her see something rewarding. As the trio bonded, Sierra walked over all smiles, asking how her lovelies were doing, telling them how awesome it is to make the finals. Dani nods, but in her confessional, she says she doesn’t mean to hesitate, stating that her time with Sierra’s been nothing but great, but she can’t help but she might be a little fake… Sierra goes over to sit next to Freddie, asking how his back’s feeling, to which Freddie admits it slightly hurts, but he doesn’t want to let it dictate him forever. Sierra jokingly says that he’s persistent to a fault, but immediately apologizes and says she meant to say that he’s persistent, but she’s a bit worried for him, saying he’s a man on fire, but doesn’t want him to set himself on fire. Freddie laughs along with her, assuring her that he’s been through a lot of injuries in the past. Sierra says in her confessional that she doesn’t mean to generalize, but Freddie being a former football player means he’s been dealt with some injuries back in college, and there might be a little CTE infecting his brain; some muscles are better off being ‘jockular’. As they continued talking, Freddie says in his own confessional that even he’s not sure how bad his back pain might be, and this is a sign for him to take the competition a bit more lighter, to not stress himself out, but more importantly, not to let the flame combust where he’d have to end up in a confessional; he admits that people like him are built strong, but not everyone can be like Superman. Nevertheless, the gang continues to vibe and toast to making it to the final road of the competition. 

\-----

**Challenge**

The next morning, everyone meandered downstairs to the dining room, wearing their newly-obtained Black Jackets, with Tem saying in her confessional that after ping-ponging between red and blue, it’s nice that she gets to have a rather permanent color to her jacket; it’s a bit weird, but she’s all in for things becoming weird; nothing surprises her anymore. They would meet Chef Ramsay, who had something very special to share. First off, he’d congratulate the Black Jackets for making it this far into the competition, to the cheers of everyone. Ramsay continues by telling them that twenty chefs entered through those doors, and out of all of them, six of them remain, meaning they are very close to the end, but not close enough. Sierra says in her confessional that she can smell that promotion from far away. Nevertheless, he tells them that today’s challenge is yet another test to their culinary prowess, and it’s not only going to involve how they create their dishes, but how they coordinate as a duo. He summons the sous chefs to wheel in a table, to which they do, the table featuring two silver domes on top. Dani eagerly wonders in her confessional what in the heck they are, hoping it has something to do with pasta. Ramsay would uncover both domes, one of them revealed to be a grilled lobster, and the other a ribeye steak. Ramsay asks the teams how they’d like to have this Surf n’ Turf, because that’s basically what they’re going to be doing in this challenge. He explains that two people will form into a team and work together in this unique kind of Surf n’ Turf challenge; each will have to work on one protein, working in different kitchens doing so. Midway through, however, they’ll have to switch kitchens and cook each others’ proteins. This challenge won’t be about how delicious their overall dish is, but how much they trust each other. Some of the chefs looked at each other, some studious, others hopeful. Sierra haughtily says in her confessional that she hopes that there’ll be enough trust to go around, because she pretty much knows her proteins; whether it be land or sea. Ramsay, wanting to make it special, decides to have everyone draw lottery sticks, telling them not to peek, because he wants to make some pairings interesting if made possible. He’s got two Red sticks, two Yellows, and two Blues, telling them to either close their eyes or look away, as Freddie chuckled in his confessional of how silly this looks, but whether or not it be with someone he’s close to, that’s up to the equation. Ramsay counted down from three, and everyone would draw a stick… Upon learning what color they had, the reactions varied, mainly positive though, with Rio instantly giggling as soon as he found out he drew Yellow with Dani, while Kara drew Blue with Tem, and Freddie drew Red with Sierra. Sierra mutters in her confessional that there’s no way she could lose this on the account of Freddie, but says that hopefully he’ll provide more than just his broken back. Meanwhile, Kara was grinning ear to ear as she found out she was partnered with Tem, who couldn’t help but chuckle along, and Kara would back this up in her confessional that this pairing’s gonna feel lucky tonight; she can feel a row of Lucky 7’s landing on them. Ramsay told the duos that they’ve got forty-five minutes to come up with a good combination between land and sea proteins, and that’s why he’s giving them five minutes to discuss, twenty minutes to cook on whatever, and when they reach the twenty-minute mark, they have to switch kitchens. Their challenge will start… now!

\-----

**Dani & Rio vs. Sierra & Freddie vs. Tem & Kara**

\-----

All three duos began discussing what to do; with Dani & Rio, they discussed what kinds of proteins they’d be working on. Rio wondered in his confessional about the many different meat possibilities, because a lot of surf n’ turf options mainly consist of red meat. Rio suggested they include a hanger steak, but the surf option must pair well with it, according to Dani… After thinking about it, they decide to go for scallops, to which Dani suggested if they make them bacon-wrapped, because even with the additional lean on turf, it still makes it delicious, and why not go for a southern Steakhouse pairing? Rio agrees with her decision, and he follows it up in his confessional that this could be a challenge-winning pairing. Freddie & Sierra were also in the midst of debating what kind of proteins to use, and Sierra suggested they try something different; a cow is always used for surf n’ turf, and though Freddie was a bit skeptical, he thought of something like elk or venison. Sierra shrugged, suggesting that works, while Freddie says in his confessional that he wouldn’t mind going for something like chicken or turkey, but he thinks venison might be a creative alternative to cow meat, and whatever gambit he and Sierra make, they’d better execute accordingly. Freddie would suggest shrimp as their sea protein as it may not be as complicated as other seafood, it’s still a common surf option, to which Sierra agreed with that idea. The only thing they need is what kind of flavor they’ll be using, because it should be something to embolden this pairing. Freddie says that this would be a delicious dish in Greece, and Sierra is intrigued with the flavor pairing; she just hopes they can work together, even if they’re thirty feet away from each other. Tem & Kara were also wondering what to make for their meat-sea pairing, because they want to be creative, but they don’t want to go overboard. Kara points out that filet mignon wouldn’t be a bad pick to make. Tem had no problem with it, and in her confessional, she says that filet’s quite easy, and she immediately knows what kind of sea option to use. She would suggest to Kara that they should have lobster, since nobody else chose that option, and hearing the kinds of flavorings from their rivals, Tem suggested making it French, and Kara squeals, interested with that idea, and she follows it up in her confessional that she can’t wait to drop the guillotine on this challenge… before awkwardly telling ‘the audience’ she didn’t mean it like that!

With the discussions wrapped up, each took their places; Dani, Kara, and Sierra would designate themselves on their respective teams’ sea protein in the Blue Kitchen, while Rio, Tem, and Freddie made themselves in charge of the meat proteins in the Red Kitchen. Michelle walked over to check on her ‘meatmakers’, first going to Tem, asking what she’s going to be making. She tells her she’s working on the filet, searing it in butter, but she also says that she’s going to try making a puree with red wine and carrot as a topping. Tem had no issue with it, but did advise Tem that when her partner comes in, to make sure she’s informed of what she’s making. Tem nods, and in her confessional, she says that execution’s important for their dish, and it’s not just the meat pairings that matter, but also how they taste, so she’s hoping Kara’s working well with their lobster. With Rio, he was making his hanger steak, and in his confessional, he says he was confident with this kind of combination, and he’s going to make sure it’s a bit flavorful for wear. As he seasoned the steak, Freddie was making the lamb, and Michelle was intrigued with how he was using something other than cow, telling him that he’s quite daring, but as long as he utilizes a few factors, then the Surf n’ Turf could work, stating that there are a few sea pairings that can work well with lamb. In his confessional, Freddie says that lamb is daring, to Michelle’s credit, but whatever kind of combination he and Sierra are going to make, it’s going to be one of the most daring combinations imaginable. In the Blue Kitchen, the others were working hard to make their Surf options. Over with Dani, she was seen frying up some bacon, while also prepping scallops, to which a curious James asked what he was up to. When learning what fish protein she was using, James advises her that the addition of bacon’s fine, but what really matters in the surf element is how great the scallops are. In her confessional, Dani says that this is some kind of gambit she and Rio are working on, but to James’ point, she doesn’t want the bacon to be the main element in the surf. Meanwhile, Sierra was cooking shrimp, and when asked by James what she was going to do with it, she explains she’s going to make it a little Mediterranean spin, adding a few herbs and lemon to her seasoning, and she says in her confessional that this is a dish she'll make sure Ramsay will love, and with a little paprika and garlic, it’ll make Ramsay demand more. As for Kara, she was prepping her lobster, making sure the water in the pot was bubbling, and she kept making small ‘bubble’ sounds, to which an annoyed Sierra told her to stop distracting her. After Kara uttered an apology, Sierra rolled her eyes in her confessional, saying that she doesn’t have a lot of time for Kara, and for all she knows, she’s going to self-implode very soon. 

Ramsay came forward and reminded the duos that the twenty-minute mark is about to occur, and for them to switch kitchens and cook their teammates’ other protein. With everyone switching kitchens, they had to also brief them on what was going on, with Freddie, Sierra, Tem, and Kara doing so. Dani also informed Rio of the status of her scallops, confidently fueling Rio, as he skipped over to the scallops to finish them off, just before Dani could ask her about the hanger steak. Dani confusedly stated in her confessional that Rio just took off without even so much as giving a chance to brief her about his steak, and this is going to leave her in the dark. Despite this, Dani remained vigil working on the steak, adding a few more spices to the mix, but cooking it tenderly to make sure it’s cooked to perfection. Kara peered over and told Dani she’s doing a good job, and it might be finished very soon. As for her, she was working hard on the filet, basting it in butter and frying it on the pan, as Michelle asks her how long until it’s finished, and she says it might be done in five minutes. Michelle would explain that very soon, she and her partner Tem will have to plate their dish, to which Kara nodded, and in her confessional, Kara says that she’s working well like a motorboat, and even makes a few ‘boat noises’ with her lips. As for Sierra, she was working along with the lamb, even putting on a red wine and rosemary reduction sauce, and she says this dish will definitely charm the pants off of Ramsay; Kara overhears her and giggles at this, to which Sierra ignores and continues cooking. As for what was going on in the Blue Kitchen, Freddie added a little thyme to the shrimp to make it more Mediterranean-worthy, and in addition, he garnished the oil (which was what helped cook the shrimp in the pan) with some garlic, and if that wasn’t good enough, he decided to add a little bit of dill to it. Rio tells Freddie he might be onto something, whereas he’s trying to figure out what kind of seasoning he should make for his scallops. Freddie encourages him not to give up on them, because even some spice can make them work. Rio agrees, and with that, he adds some black pepper to his scallops, and as for the bacon, he applies a brown sugar glaze to the exterior, and in his confessional, he wishes he could just taste his dish already, but then Ramsay wouldn’t get to enjoy it. Tem, meanwhile, was poaching the lobster, and even going as far as to making a beurre blanc sauce. In her confessional, she recalls a few times where she’s made seafood dishes, with a few flashbacks of her in challenges overcooking them, but she affirms that hopefully she’s learned her lesson since then, and for better or worse, she’s clawing her way back up to glory. At that moment, Ramsay began counting down seconds, to which Rio asked where the time went, and Freddie and Tem reminded him to get up to the pass with his dish. But in the end, everyone managed to plate their surf n’ turf proteins just in time for Ramsay to count down to ‘one’. 

With time up, and everyone plating their surf n’ turf specials, Ramsay congratulated everyone for a job well done. He tells them that he’s very interested in seeing which pairing is going to be crafted well, but it won’t be just a matter of how paired it felt, but also how beautifully cooked it was. But he’s not going to do it alone… He would welcome a special guest judge coming in to assist with him in grading each dish; he worked for Jean-Georges Vongerichten in the Matador Room, and has also won season thirteen of *Top Chef*, and even opened a few restaurants, Stubborn Seed included to name such. He has also hosted *Fast Foodies* on *TruTV*, where they recreate a fast food item and make their own spin on it… Jeremy Ford. Sure enough, Jeremy walked in with a confident smile, waving to all the chefs who welcomed him with applause. As Jeremy shook hands with Ramsay, Rio said in his confessional that he’s seen a few episodes of *Fast Foodies* back when he was recovering from COVID, and it’s nice to see him here in the flesh. Jeremy expresses confidence of the surf n’ turf dishes they’ll be serving, and after a little bit of bantering amongst the two judges, Ramsay announced they’ll be grading their dishes ala King of the Hill-style, where the best dish will sit on a throne, to which Michelle and James were seen carrying a big throne close to the judges. Tem was psyched about this in her confessional, saying that any of their dishes will be ‘A Number One, Top of the List,’ before realizing that she’s quoting Frank Sinatra’s famous New York song, where she quips “*Gotta love New York,*”

First up was Dani & Rio with their dish, as Ramsay asked them to describe their dish. Dani presented their hanger steak and scallop combination, and Rio would chime in and describe that they made a smoky steakhouse flavoring for each protein; he describes the scallops wrapped in bacon, complete with smoked paprika, soy sauce on the bacon, as well as a slight pinch of bourbon and black pepper on the scallops. Turning their attention to the hanger steak, Jeremy asks Dani about it, and Dani says she added some lemon, onion, and paprika, but Rio would also nudge her a bit, reminding her to add that there was also coffee involved in the steak as well, but Dani whispered back that she didn’t know, which created confusion amongst the duo, and Dani would vent in her confessional saying that she likes Rio, but he didn’t tell her the jist of what to do with the steak, with a flashback of Rio eagerly running off after Dani told him what to do with her scallops. Meanwhile, Ramsay and Jeremy looked a bit perplexed, with Ramsay asking what really happened, reminding them they’re supposed to be a team, to give each other communication on what they were working on, even when cooking in different kitchens. Dani and Rio looked a bit nerved-up by Ramsay’s stern lecture, but the Brit sighed and decided to cut open the steak and scallops. Jeremy would point out that this is a nice concept, though the addition of bacon makes the surf n’ turf lean towards turf territory, to which there was a shot of Dani nodding along. Upon taking a few bites of each, Jeremy said that the scallops were cooked nicely, and both it and the steak had a rather delicious blend in terms of flavor. Ramsay tells them that the good news is both dishes have great flavorings, praising the two chefs for making their seasonings not too overwhelming, but just enough for them to enjoy. The only problem is that the hanger steak is a bit too well done, with the Brit pointing out that it was a bit dry upon first bite. Jeremy agreed, saying it could’ve made for an otherwise great dish. Dani facepalmed in her confessional of how this might not give them the challenge win after all, while Rio says in his own confessional that he’s looking at Dani, and he feels bad for not getting a chance to tell her about his steak, the same way she told him about her scallops. Nevertheless, Ramsay tells them that their dish will remain on the throne unless someone else knocks them off, placing it on the cushion for the time being. 

The next pairing was Sierra & Freddie with their lamb and shrimp surf n’ turf, and Sierra describes their garlic-rosemary lamb chops cooked in olive oil and zested with lemon, topped with a red wine reduction sauce. Jeremy is intrigued hearing Sierra describe her and Freddie’s lamb, asking if they were going for a Greek flavoring, to which Sierra smiled and nodded. Freddie would also describe their shrimp sautéd in white wine and olive oil, and seasoned with thyme and garlic, garnished with a few lemon wedges. Ramsay cuts into the lamb first, and he tells them that it looks cooked well, noting the pinkness of the meat. Upon eating the lamb, Jeremy mentions how much flavor it has, and the reduction sauce evens out the garlic and rosemary, acting as a counter to balance things out. After cutting into the shrimp, the duo take bites into the shrimp, noting how beautifully cooked it is. Sierra says in her confessional that they’re saying how beautifully cooked it is, and this could seal it for them. Jeremy notes that this surf n’ turf pairing is a lot different, since it’s a non-cow kind of meat, but it works. Ramsay agrees, asking if it’s better than Rio and Dani’s surf n’ turf dish… After a bit of thinking, he confirms that it is. Freddie and Sierra give each other a high five hearing this, as Ramsay switches out Rio and Dani’s dish for Freddie and Sierra’s, as Dani was seen shaking her head, and in her confessional, she says that it was fun while it lasted, but some things have to bring her back to reality. Meanwhile, Sierra says in her confessional that they’re bringing the house down with their action. 

The third and final pairing was Tem & Kara with their filet mignon and lobster pairing, and Ramsay could tell that this pairing looked solid; it’s quite a common surf n’ turf option. Kara says in her confessional that this might be for the books. Kara would describe their dish, how they went for a French-type of pairing, with her describing her filet mignon, and how on that steak was a puree consisting of pinot noir red wine and carrot, and also sautéd shallots, spread out sparsely. Jeremy was intrigued with the presentation of the dish, noting how lax the shallots were placed, as well as how sound the sauce looked. Tem would also describe the lobster tail, having poached it in butter, and has created a beurre blanc sauce, complete with white wine, butter, and vinegar. In her confessional, Tem says that she’s praying that this French dish will make for a fun upset for this challenge, because after hearing how great Freddie and Sierra’s combo was, she’s banking on a ‘vengeance par derrière’, and she can’t believe she brought up a fun term from her high school French class; it’s been a while, she says. Upon cutting into the lobster and filet, the two took turns commenting on how beautifully-cooked each protein was. Ramsay would wonder how it tastes, because when it comes to France, they definitely have a palate that makes Napoleon Bonaparte charge forward for action. The two would take bites on both proteins, where they noted how the two dishes’ flavors are different, but their textures marry each other, enough to make it taste like a five-star dish. Jeremy jokes that if he were here, Napoleon could love this meal, and it’d inspire him to actually overcome Waterloo. However, the big question would be if this surf n’ turf is better than Freddie and Kara’s… Kara prayed in her confessional, hoping that Ramsay would say yes. And Ramsay would ultimately say…

That it was. The two ladies cheered upon hearing Ramsay’s final decision, and as he moved to take off Freddie and Sierra’s dish, Freddie smirked in his confessional, saying that it was a good effort he and Sierra put into their dish, but as Ramsay and Jeremy said, Tem and Kara’s dish was much better. Meanwhile, Tem was overjoyed in her confessional, saying that it was such a relief to hear Ramsay declare her and Kara’s dish the best, and she wonders if she’ll have to study more about French cuisine moving forward; “*Ou la la,*” she says.

My coworker has been at our company for a year. We have lots in common, chat a huge amount throughout the day, and we also work closely together in our small team. Throughout the day, we go on lunches out together, get coffee in the mornings together, go on errand runs etc, and we get along well. She initiates most of these activities, and I initiate some.

After a year, I thought I’d ask her if she wanted to go for dinner sometime after work and texted her asking this. I have a lot of work friends and have outings like this with them regularly. She didn’t reply to my message. The next day she asked to go to lunch together and let me know she doesn’t come to work to make friends and would not want to meet outside of work. She said she doesn’t mix her personal and work life. I said I completely understand and wouldn’t ask again. She said she’s very happy to continue doing everything we do during work hours like coffees and lunches but nothing outside of work hours because she doesn’t want a friendship.

I completely understand that people do not like to mix their personal and work life but I feel a bit awkward now. We work very closely together, sit next to each other, spend most of our day together. I don’t know what to do going forward. I don’t think I will initiate asking to do anything at lunch or during the day anymore (I have other people at work who I’d definitely consider friends who I also sometimes go out during the day with), but she has said she would like to continue to socialise during work hours.

1qordny,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1qordny/should_i_change_to_day_shift/,Should I change to day shift?,"Hi all. It's my first time on this sub. I've been working night shifts for maybe 6 months now. I work in a nursing home and the reason I switched to nights is because days here are absolutely crazy: there's so much to do, no one has time to just scroll their phone for five minutes, everyone needs something from you and the break is short and stressful.

Anyway, since I started nights, I have been feeling more relaxed and at peace. I love the nights here. I know my routine and can do everything even with my eyes closed.

We have a decent break and some of us even sleep during the break (I can't do that, I drink too much coffee, lol).

Anyway, the main problem I have with the NS is that I have no life outside work.

When I get some time off, all I do is sleep to recuperate the lost hours. I am also sluggish and bored most times and have no motivation to go out and meet people/do things. Also, during my shifts when I have to sleep during the day, I can maybe get 5-6 hours maximum.

That is concerning to me because I want to have a good sleep-also, sleep is crucial for your health and immunity.

Anyone else went through this and shifted back to days? If you did shift, how was the period of adjusting? Did you started enjoying your life, anything changed in that area?",0,1769549625.0,Nightshift,3,0.5,False

They’ll pay for “things like shampoo” but I doubt that includes makeup or any kind of nice brands. 

I just don’t know how APs survive. The COL around Paris and Amsterdam is pretty comparable to that of major cities in USA. I couldn’t even afford to get a coffee. Like ppl living off €340/mo don’t buy a €5 coffee. I certainly couldn’t buy clothes, no nice makeup or skincare, no eating out at nice restaurants or bars. I’ll want to travel so I’m planning to save all my money for weekend trips. What if I want a haircut? Or to sign up for spin classes or something??

Ofc I’ve saved money, but just getting there is a lot. I have to pay for my own flight and all the visa expenses. Put money aside for a flight home too. I’m planning on having abt $3000 saved up for 12 months. Is that doable?

1qorb4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/comments/1qorb4y/request_feedback_on_dating_as_a_schizoid/,[Request] Feedback on dating as a Schizoid,"Hello folks!

I discovered this forum several days ago, and for the first time in my life, I saw people sharing similar private thoughts and tendencies. I didn't realize I could even enjoy the thought that someone might understand some of me. (I have written and thought ""I want to want"" so many times)

**To those farther along in life, I would appreciate feedback on my overall thought process regarding dating.**

***I am interested in general strategies for dating, although I have also provided a fairly lengthy context outside of it.*** *The context isn't necessary, although it may be helpful to form a more complete understanding / have more to critique and analyze.*

**Why date?**

***I genuinely don't mind being alone for the rest of my life.*** I talk to my close friend every other month or so, and it would take several months of solitude before I would feel lonely. If I feel lonely, it takes about an hour of interaction to recover. Day to day, I've been alone for most of my life, and during the other bits, I frequently prefer to be alone. People-managing is a massive energy tax, and dating exacerbates it until I need a week to recover from a 2-hour coffee date.

**Still, I am interested in dating to:**

\- roll the dice to hit the jackpot and see if I ***can either experience emotions from experiences I haven't had before, or if there is anything a partnership might be able to induce in me emotionally.*** Maybe I'm missing something.

***- better social skill adjustment***. I cannot perceive possible intentions towards me. If I were a salesperson, I would be decent at everything but the timing to actually close. I imagine if I could experience a prolonged period of positive emotions directed towards me (2+ hrs), then I could eventually start identifying signals.

***- receive physical affection.*** I recently discovered that I enjoy being held. The problem is that I cannot stay masked while receiving affection -- I unravel. If I lose the mask, I am relatively confident that I am ugly in personality and physical expression. Unraveling:

*++ I would struggle to imagine the average healthy woman finding my flavor of schizoid-ish personality attractive. Even if I am an untalented performer, the performance is better than me.*

*++ I lose my practiced proprioception/confidence. I will start stumbling, slouching slightly, moving more awkwardly, and losing my practiced smile to a genuine, but nervous smile. One woman once complimented my unpracticed smile, so I can imagine some awkwardness will be tolerated, given a strong enough initial impression.*

*++ Still, men behaving nervously are less attractive than those with effortless (seeming) confidence. I am sure there's a flavor of ""nervous-because-he's-so-into-me-so-cuuuuuute"" that might appeal to some women, but I haven't personally encountered that trope.*

\- giving affection is much easier. Comforting someone with a hug, reassurance, or a smile is risky. I am awkward even while masked, but most recipients can appreciate the effort. Several people (both genders) have cried in my arms, and I do not believe they were trying to act to exploit me later. As far as I know, they haven't attempted to harm me afterward and appeared appreciative.

*++ As an aside, I understand the thought process of ""haven't attempted to harm me afterward"" is unattractive. I have enough bad actors in my life that I cannot remove this default without causing harm to myself, so I will usually contain these thoughts to reduce my unattractiveness while retaining my maladaptive behaviors*

Alternatively, I am content receiving a horrid experience that will write off dating for the rest of my life, and the inner obligation to try. It \*will\* have to be bad enough for my future self to accept the past's decision if my perceived-perfect partner is in front of me, and I never developed the skill to date.

**Current affairs:**

*TLDR: little experience with harm aversion to strangers.*

I am a man in my late 20s with practically no experience, and I navigate dating consciously, thinking about minimizing harm to others. I can accept delivering a boring/disappointing experience, but I would deeply regret performing so badly as to cause mental-harm within a well-adjusted woman. A badly placed comment might induce a slight insecurity, and I don't want that. I want to leave forgotten, but leave the world a slightly better place.

I was hoping to be more open to women with problematic behaviors, assuming they would have lower expectations and I could more readily satisfy them ***(One of the only ways I can feel happiness past an anhedonia block is through forced empathy from other people enjoying themselves),*** but I couldn't maintain attraction under even light-to-medium toxicity. I dislike being manipulated, and it is too much trouble to pretend to go along with the manipulation. I can handle insecure people, but I am worried about causing attachment and subsequent harm from detachment. Avoidant folks tend to avoid me, for unimaginable reasons. Ironically, I would feel the most comfortable with avoidants, but I understand I am an anomalous avoidant who fights against their instincts. It would be too much to fight against my and the avoidant's instincts.

**Attractiveness:**

I hold the deeply admired schizoid personality, and I am physically short (only an inch higher than most girls in my area). I am not deformed, and I have high-level-but-specialized athleticism. I practice a sport that gives me some grace in everyday movements with decent posture. I have been told that my voice is unique-in-a-pleasant way, and have been given compliments for multiple different fashion styles. I am perceived as very playful, and my name tends to be remembered. A lot of individuals laugh or smile when with me, but I cannot tell when they are doing so out of politeness, social obligations, or their own discomfort. Assuming a 10% success ratio, then I have at least one funny exchange any day I have social interaction. I am currently working on my smile and delivering better subliminal context while hugging.

All-in-all, I am estimating that my attractiveness is about 1 or 2 levels below average. This causes difficulty since I don't have enough general attractiveness to override awkwardness/aloofness while wearing my mask, much less being schizoid, much less being unable to perceive any positive intentions towards me.

Truly, I would appreciate any of the more-experienced folk to chime in with their own thoughts and or analysis on my thought process.",3,1769549474.0,Schizoid,1,1.0,False

There’s a bunch of typical suggestions (stir intention into your coffee, etc) but I’d like to offer this advice:

Get yourself a 365-day, witchcraft-themed book or journal! These types of books will prompt you into doing something witchy everyday, and even if you can’t actually do the day’s activities, reading a blurb every day still sparks ideas, helps you learn, and allows you to further develop your craft.

My favorite is Llwellyn’s Spell-A-Day Almanac. I don’t usually do the activity on the actual day, but I do at least read it and I get so many good ideas for spells.

There are also a ton of witchy journals out there with daily prompts.

1qorawc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qorawc/aitah_for_going_to_the_pilates_class_we_agreed_to/,AITAH for going to the pilates class we agreed to?,"My best friend ""Wren"" has had an issue the last few years initiating meetings for us to hangout. She's gotten more scatterbrained with having two kids and started working full time again after being home for awhile so I understand and try to suggest time for us to hangout to stay connected. Our goal is once a month. 

The issue is we live about 37ish minutes apart but we always end up somewhere close (within 3-5 minutes) to her house. I will suggest something closer to me and she seems to find a reason to not want to go there. 

""I don't like the reviews they seem shitty...""

""I feel uncomfortable with a man working there....""

""This place is supposed to be super good and my coworker recommended it. Why not try this instead?""

""Shit sorry I got caught up in \*\*\*\*\*'s schoolwork this week.  I just tried to book and it's sold out. Let's try this place!""

""Want to just come over for coffee? I'm exhausted."" 

""Shit man I'm sorry I'm running super late. Can we just go to Panera for a drink and bagel?""

Those are all real texts about us meeting up. On top of that, I always somehow end up in charge of booking. She is always too frazzled or busy. If I check in to see if she booked something it's always ""Shit man I forgot I'll do it now!"" followed by a slew of texts about how behind she in here and there and I always offer to book it or e end up at the Panera Bread by her house. She's always apologetic for being so chaotic and unorganized.

Well, our plan was the meet up this weekend to do a Pilates class together. They have a studio with impeccable reviews and it's in the middle for us both. 20 mins for me and 23 mins for her. All female teachers. Perfect. I floated the idea and she said yes. Perfect.

Well, this morning she texted me with her confirmation for a Yoga class at a different studio down the road from her house. I mapped it. 42 minute drive for me and 6 minute drive for her. When I asked what it was for she said it was for this weekend and the same old song and dance ensued. This has been happening increasingly too often to not be deliberate so I decided to gently confront the issue.

I told her we seem to always be close to her house and while I understand she's busy, I am too and I'd like to go to the studio we agreed on because its too much for me to drive 42 mins. She said it just wouldn't work for her to go to that studio. I told her that was fine but I already paid for the class so I'll go and then we can get lunch and a restaurant that I know is in the middle between the studios after both our classes.

At this point, she called me. She asked if I was upset and I was honest. I'm not ""upset"" persay but I'm tired of being responsible for coming to her 100% of the time to continue to be friends. I told her it seems like she only wants to see me if I can come to her. She told me that her marriage is strained and she's the default parent so it's important that she can get home quickly during or after our dates because ""Teddy"", her husband is always texting to ask where she is at and when she will be home and since I don't have kids she didn't think I would mind the driving.

This next part is where I might be the AH.

Wren knows me well enough to know I have been staunchly against being made to work harder in any sense because I'm not a mother. My time is not less valuable. Her saying that set me off. I told her that I'm going to the class that I paid for because not it seems like she's been goading me into going to her neck of the woods to compensate for Teddy being unable to parent his kids for a few hours once a month (if we even hangout), I'm hurt that my best friend would do something like that instead of talking to me about it.

When it was all said and done, she said I was an AH for not giving her grace and knowing she's got things hard but I told her I don't like that as my best friend, she's been duping me for years. We ended the call before harsher words were said. 

She texted me just now saying she's feeling pretty emotionally upset after our talk and might not want to get lunch on Saturday and I told her that was fine and to let me know. I'm feeling pretty bad about it thinking I may have been too harsh but this has been going on for almost 8 years now of us only meeting in her neighborhood and I'm genuinely tired of it.

So, AITAH?

I will also say before people come for me, I don't hate kids whatsoever. But I'm not someone who wants to meet up with my girlfriends with their kids in tow at all times. It's not fun for me. I've done things like go to the park and have a coffee while the kids play and things like that. ",1,1769549461.0,AITAH,9,0.67,False

There's a woman (35F) at my church that I’ve known for about 13 years. I used to attend a different church, but we attended the same singles group for many years. I was never seriously interested in her and when the singles group dissolved, we fell out of touch.

Then just a little over four years ago I joined the church where she attends. We have always been friendly to each other, but never really got close. She is a very supportive friend and I value her friendship.

I never had any romantic interest because I didn’t view her as my type and just never liked her in that way. However, over the last few weeks I have started noticing something I haven’t noticed before. I recently heard her testimony in a public setting and began to realize how godly she is. This kind of got me wondering and as I observed her, all the reasons that prevented my interest in the past have all but vanished.

I am still taking my time to make sure my interest is genuine, but I don’t think I can ignore her any longer. We also have some similar interests, we both desire to serve, and I believe I am starting to be attracted to her personality and appearance. I just need more time to know for sure.

I have confided about this with a close friend and fellow elder who advised me to take my time to pray about this but also suggested it might be worth inviting her to coffee as just friends to help me discern the genuineness of my own interest.

Even though it’s only been about a month, I tend to think there is something to this at least on my side. However, I still have concerns. I have no reason to believe she is interested and I would hate to damage our friendship.

Is grabbing coffee a good idea at this point? How do I navigate this wisely since we’ve known each other for so long? If my interest grows what’s a good timeframe for next steps? I just feel less sure of what to do since we have known each other for so long without any known interest.

My goal isn’t to be ageist, but after cruising to some Cars and Coffees and being the youngest by a couple of decades or more, I’ve been feeling a bit out of place. Granted, maybe Cars and Coffee isn’t the spot.

I’m interested in maybe bi-weekly meetups, jackets, car placards all of it. The only requirement is that you own a car you’re building, have built, or are consistently thrashing on, and that we cruise together and help each other out wrenching.

Please give the song above a listen. I wrote it for my state and those across the US. A lot could be said about this song, this moment...

As you Twin Cities folks know, Minneapolis is currently a battleground in the US's cyclical war against white supremacy. I wrote this song in March 2025, when ICE was harming LA, Chicago, New York - non-combatants forced to defend themselves from facist goon sqauds and protect their neighbors from being sent to concentration camps. Less than a year later, the war on is my doorstep, in our streets, our lives threatened, with only each other to rely on as the laws and systems continually fail us. It scares me. I am a writer, not a fighter - but there are many ways to fight a fight - and joining together gives us the courage to tap into creative ways to meet the needs of a community under siege. Even bards have a role.

I hope this song brings you the courage, and know we will win because their violence cannot be sustained. We will carry each other through these dark times.

vorab: Ich habe mal viel Kaffee getrunken und ihn sehr genossen. Hatte auch mal eine Bezzera BZ09 und habe mit frischem Röstereikaffee wunderbaren Kaffee und Espresso zu zaubern. Leider kam es so, dass ich irgendwann Kaffee kaum vertragen hatte, sodass ich alles verkauft habe. Inzwischen habe ich festgestellt, dass ich 1-2 Tassen pro Woche doch wieder ganz gut vertrage. Deshalb wollte ich mir gern für Gelegenheitskaffee ein kleines Maschinchen hinstellen. 

Aktuell habe ich eine French Press zuhause. Da ich aber so wenig trinke, ist es schwierig Pulver/Bohnen vorzuhalten, sodass sie dann auch noch wirklich toll schmecken.  
Zunächst dachte ich tatsächlich an Kapseln. Ich hatte früher mal eine Tassimo mit der ich halbwegs zufrieden war - aber der Plastikmüll - ne.

Dann habe ich gesehen, dass die Nespresso Maschinen inzwischen ja dutzende Fremdhersteller supporten. Und angeblich gibt es biokompostierbare Kapseln. Zu deren tatsächlichen Kompostierbarkeit und den Umweltfolgen sind die Quellen aber alle sehr zwiegespalten. Von ""Ganz schlimm für die Umwelt"" über ""Kompostierung klappt eher weniger gut, aber man kanns auch in Restmüll werfen und dann wirds dort ja mehr oder weniger klimaneutral verbrannt"" bis hin zu ""die Alukapseln sind das beste, weil die werden zu 100% recycelt"" liest man exakt alles.

Pads sind für mich geschmacklich raus. Ebenso eine Nespresso Maschine und die Kapseln selbst zu befüllen - dann kann ich auch bei der Frenchpress bleiben.

CoffeeB ist aufgetaucht. Geschmacklich scheint das Feedback hier im Sub durchwachsen zu sein, aber durchaus noch positiv. Die Maschinen hingegen scheinen bei Rezensionen nicht so gut wegzukommen was Langlebigkeit angeht.

Dann bin ich noch über Nivona Cube 4 gestolpert. Ist zwar wieder mehr Handarbeit, scheint mir aber so als würde man halbwegs unkompliziert einen brauchbaren Kaffee oder Espresso zaubern können. Vorhaltung des Kaffees ist hier natürlich auch wieder ein Problem. Dank integrierter Mühle und Dosierung pro Tasse könnte man hier versuchen sich den Kaffee immerhin in Form von Bohnen vorzuhalten.



Mhhh.

Was sagt ihr? Übersehe ich irgendwo Details? Habe ich ein System vergessen? Gibt es vielleicht noch etwas anderes tolles kompaktes wie den Nivona Cube4?

The Most Expensive Item in Your Budget is ""Inaction"" 📉

We obsess over the price of a coffee, a subscription, or a flight to the Riviera Maya.
But we ignore the massive, compounding cost of waiting.

Waiting for the ""perfect"" market conditions.
Waiting for your boss to give you permission.
Waiting to feel ""ready"".

**Readiness is a Myth**

I learned this hopping between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The jungle grows whether you are watching it or not. 
It doesn't ask for permission. It just occupies space.

You don't get ready to launch a business. You launch the business to get ready.
You don't get fit to go to the gym. You go to the gym to get fit.

**The Compound Interest of Fear**

Every day you wait is a day of compound interest you are paying to your fears.
The market rewards speed, not perfection.
Your ""perfect plan"" is worthless if it stays in your head.

**The Challenge**

Stop checking the price tag on action. Start checking the price tag on inaction.
If you stay exactly where you are for the next 5 years, what is the cost?

Regret is the only bill you can't afford to pay.
Move. Now.

[Round 3: Roadsters / Naked sports.](https://www.reddit.com/r/indianbikes/s/6nOU8DwQMQ)

After running the 3 selection polls, and having taken the test ride for a bunch of bikes, not all yet, I am gravitating towards a select few.

Agnostic of the category of the bike, i would like to see, what you guys think of each, in isolation and/or comparison, if you have a similar usage of a motorcycle as mine; read context below.

SELECT ONE, if you had to, and please leave discussions below if you have the time and intent.

Context: 

City use (maximum).
Bangalore roads.
Bangalore traffic.
Recreational vehicle.
No pillion.
_Further context below;_

75 kg body weight.
36M
5'9"" height

I used to ride Pulsar 180, rode it for ≈13 years, before selling it off, 4 years ago.
Currently, I'm eyeing ditching 2 out of the 4 wheels in my car and getting a bike again for solo city usage and recreational riding.

Primary use case would be within the city, but once every three months, if the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to venture out on a bewildering highway exploration ride, in and around Bangalore.
No goals, no destination, ride solo, enjoy the scenic views, stop for food, and return.

I'm not hellbent on a specific kind of motorcycle, as long as it makes me feel happy.
Personally, from experience, I have always preferred a slightly aggressive stance, like a roadster, but I realize I'm getting old for it (not really), but I think I can explore / learn to enjoy the experiences of other form factors as well.

Additional context is that, my job is WFH, so my daily commutes within the city are not work related journeys. It's just running basic errands or going across the city to grab a cup of coffee and unwind. Or simply unwinding through the busyness and noises of the streets. (Sometimes I get lonely alone at home working all day, okay, don't judge.)

I’m fairly new to DC and looking to meet people who enjoy exploring cafés, new restaurants, and getting to know the city.

A little about me: I’m a 31-year-old guy originally from the Middle East. I write poetry, love good coffee, long walks, hikes, checking out bars, trying different cuisines, and staying active (the gym is my reset button). By day I’m a transportation engineer, and I’m also in the process of starting my own business, so I’d especially love to connect with fellow entrepreneurs or people building something of their own.

I’m hoping to meet chill, curious people who are down for café hopping, food adventures, or good conversation over coffee or a drink. Open to small group hangs too.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to comment or DM 🙂",1,1769548821.0,DMVArea,0,1.0,False

When trying to fetch a release found through Tubifarry it sits in the queue as ""Downloading"" for a bit before vanishing, then automatically searching for another source and grabbing a Slskd release. But *every* time this fails as well because the releases don't match the arbitrary 80%. I've tried many different artists and albums and it always matches at like 60-75%. 

I've been tearing my hair out trying to get it to work manually for a single release and it hasn't worked. I'm not sure how this is supposed to work as an alternative to Spotify or something when it's seemingly so strict. 

Everyone says that Tubifarry is the way to go, but it failing on me without any kind of error or anything is just defeating. The log doesn't seem to mention anything relevant either. 

Any tips? Below is an excerpt log from trying to download an album with Tubifarry after disabling the ""auto redownload on failure"" setting.

1qoqxvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/VXJunkies/comments/1qoqxvo/psa_stop_using_deprecated_flux_manifold/,PSA: Stop using deprecated flux manifold algorithms in your tertiary VX loops - you’re literally breaking causality,"\*\*\[Theory/Discussion\]\*\*

Fellow VXers, I’m posting this because I’ve seen THREE separate incidents this month where people are still running Hendricks-Moravec flux algorithms (pre-2.7 kernels) in their tertiary stabilization loops, and frankly, it’s becoming a safety hazard for the entire community.

Yesterday my neighbor’s setup started throwing ψ-resonance warnings because someone six blocks away was still using a deprecated HM-2.4 kernel with the old logarithmic dampening coefficients.

Their tertiary loop was BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with my quantum substrate oscillator.

Yeah, I know, right?!

This caused a spontaneous phase-lock that sent my temporal displacement readings into negatives, AND, I kid you not, our lab’s primary VX rig briefly existed 4.7 microseconds in the past.

My coffee was still hot while I was drinking yesterday’s cup.

Look, I get it. The HM-2.4 kernels were beautifully elegant, and yes, the sinusoidal flux curves were \*chef’s kiss\* perfect for amateur builds. But the quantum substrate mapping is fundamentally broken when you’re running anything above 847 milliKelvins in your primary coil assembly. The orthogonal matrix calculations literally cannot compensate for the inverted tachyon bleed-through.

Here’s what happens (and Dr. Patterson’s 2019 paper backs this up):

When your HM algorithm tries to reconcile a backwards flux manifold with a forward-temporal substrate, the resulting paradox gets resolved by borrowing energy from neighboring VX installations. This is why people’s modules are mysteriously drawing 23% more power lately - you’re literally powering someone else’s causality violations.

Immediate action items:

1. If you MUST run legacy HM kernels, please install a Bergman-Klein causality firewall
2. If you MUST run legacy HM kernels, please install a Bergman-Klein causality firewall
3. Check your tertiary loop frequencies - anything above 847mK should trigger an automatic kernel upgrade

Lastly, maybe, PLEASE stop posting “my VX rig is making my neighbor’s dog bark backwards” without including your full system specs. We can’t troubleshoot temporal anomalies without knowing your substrate oscillator configuration.

Stay safe out there, and remember: just because your professor built his first VX rig with vacuum tubes doesn’t mean we should ignore forty years of quantum substrate engineering.

TL/DR: my partner (48f) and I (48m) are new to polyam, and have tried to be mindful about doing the work that will help us do this well, and to decolonize and deconstruct the monogamous mindset that society has put on us. She’s been on a couple of dates with an awesome guy, and I’m dealing with some feelings and newness in the midst of it. Overall it’s been a great experience, and I’m so glad we’re doing this, even if some of the growing is challenging and sometimes doesn’t feel awesome.

Back story: I’ve been happily partnered (monogamously) for just over 12 years. She’s the love of my life, and it’s been an amazing time.

We both grew up evangelical and in purity culture, though she’s always been one to rebel against controlling systems (one of my favourite qualities of hers). We both met after divorce, and our personalities and chemistry has always been amazing. I’m really lucky! We’re very open about our love and our feelings towards each other. Like, we’re both sure we’ve experienced past lives together. And we’ve always been a little more sexually…comfortable? Liberated? Like, I love Salma Hayek, and my partner has always enthusiastically supported this (like we both give each other an enthusiastic pass for Salma and Pedro Pascal). She knew that I would sometimes watch porn and often said she wanted to watch it with me and that it turned her on, but the purity culture in my brain always made me feel shame and guilt, and I didn’t feel safe to open up and share that with her, even though she gave me so many signs that I could.

So this past spring she watched “Babygirl,” and while they direct experience is another entire conversation, it was a strong catalyst for us finally being open about desires and fantasies. And I’m delighted to say that I finally opened up to her, and it was beautiful. I can finally now say, for the first time in my life, that I love and embrace ALL of myself without shame.

This led us to start exploring kink, and with it, ENM. We learned about a local sex club, went to some kind events, met a bunch of ENM people, and learned a ton.

We also learned that compersion is a thing for her (she’s turned on by the idea of me with someone else), and it’s kind of a thing for me, though less so, specifically with men. \*That\* got us realizing that we needed to do some decolonizing of our mono-normativity. She actually learned that she’s bi as a result, which is cool, and we started really trying to educate ourselves so we don’t hurt ourselves or other people. We’ve listened to a lot of podcasts (Remodeled Love is a fave), talked to some local people in the polyam community, going to workshops, and really talking about things like jealousy, emotional and physical needs and wants. And we talked a lot about boundaries, and the difference between boundaries, agreements, rules, etc. We realized that we have so much love for each other that it feels like kind of a shame to limit it to only the two of us, and that sharing love with others doesn’t mean less for us. So it feels really good to be entering this space with a feeling of abundance, rather than lack out the need to “fix” something. It feels like a natural extension of who we are as people.

So.

A couple of months ago we got on dating apps and started dating separately, because we’d heard that this was considered by many to be a good approach for couples, especially new ones.

She found a really great guy, and I’m getting to know him, we realized that he and I are very similar, and quickly realized that he and I could be amazing friends. I appreciated that he treated her with respect and kindness, and that he showed the same to me.

Then they went out on their first date, which ended up being a 24-hour overnight date. It was weird for me, and not in an awesome way. I had a lot of time to think about my feelings and identify them and why they were coming up, and because we’d talked about it before, I knew how to observe and acknowledge them without claiming them as my reality (I practice Zen, so I have some experience doing this anyway). When she came home we talked about how it felt new, and how the discomfort I felt wasn’t because what we are exploring is bad, but merely because it’s new, but even so it still felt not awesome. We talked about how I realized that it’s my societally-imposed mono-normativity informing my feelings, and how I want to deconstruct and unlearn that stuff. We talked for a few hours and cuddled, and she was wonderfully reassuring, and it was a really nice way for us to rejoin afterwards.

Then a week later the new guy and I hung out, and we had a great time. We share a lot of interests and passions. He’s a gentleman, and I really like him a lot.

Then a few days after that he came over, but I had to work (I’m remote), so they had a date at our place. And silly, naive little me made the joke the night before that “Oh, that would be awkward and weird to walk past the room and hear noises.” I laughed, and she had an amused look on her face, and then I realized that I actually \*might\* hear noises. So that was a new weirdness to experience, due to the proximity. But it ended up being fine. Again, we talked for a while after, she reassured me, we cuddled, it felt great.

I’ve been likening this experience to Velcro: sometimes you lay the strap down and it’s connected, but at some point it needs some adjustment, so you have to separate the two sides before they can come back together. That’s how it feels to me.

Then this past Friday new guy came over and had dinner with us and our kiddo (whose response to learning we were, in his words, “Not necessarily monogamous” was to say “Well if you can’t kiss your friends, who can you kiss?”), we played games, got a good buzz on, he and I played guitar together for a couple of hours, and he spent the night in the couch. It was a really awesome time.

During all this time, I have been on one coffee date. I’ve tried to meet people, but it just hasn’t worked out for whatever reason. And I’m realizing that part of the “yuck” I’ve been feeling isn’t because my partner has found a really amazing guy, but because I haven’t had that experience yet for myself. I realized (and all of this is stuff she and I have talked about together) that a big part of it is me feeling left behind. I want my adventure. I want my NRE. I want my amazing connections.

But I have a lot of other stuff going on. I have my job, there’s a side project I’m working on that might end up taking over as my full-time job, we’re moving in a month, and I just have other priorities that are more important than dating. Not only that, but I don’t want to burn out and hurt people because I can’t manage my time well!

So I’ve decided to not date right now. This just means that there will be more feelings for me to sit with as my partner continues to explore her new relationship. And I’m so genuinely happy for her. I adore her, I really like her new guy, and I’m excited for their path together. I just am trying to be realistic that I have some more growing to do, and that’s great. I’m just accepting where I’m at and owning it rather than trying to force it to be something it’s not.

Anyway, thanks for letting me ramble. I’m excited to get to the point where I’m not feeling weirdness at the new dynamic, but I’m also trying to not rush myself through the process.

So questions for you:

How did you navigate the first time your anchor partner was dating and you weren’t (either by choice or circumstance)? And I say “The first time” because I imagine it gets easier as you continue down this path.

How do you (and I mean you, specifically, not “How does one…”) like to navigate the whole thing of feeling differently about your partner being with someone of their same sex than of the opposite sex? Like, what helped you get over that weirdness? I don’t want to make rules or conditions out whatever just because I’m insecure…my insecurity is not her responsibility.

What are some good resources for me to help me deconstruct that in-built mono-normativity that causes most of my hard feelings?

1qoqu00,https://www.reddit.com/r/PocoPhones/comments/1qoqu00/confusion_between_poco_f8_ultra_and_xiaomi_15/,Confusion between Poco F8 ultra and Xiaomi 15 (read description),"I’ve been staring at these two spec sheets for so long that I’m starting to see HyperOS icons when I close my eyes, and honestly, I’m in a state of absolute tech-paralysis because on one hand I have the Xiaomi 15—the refined, compact choice—and on the other, the Poco F8, which is basically a supercar engine strapped to a skateboard.

 The Xiaomi 15 is that perfect 6.36-inch size that actually fits in my pocket without requiring thumb gymnastics to reach the notification shade, but then I see the Poco F8 with that massive 6.67-inch screen and my brain immediately goes ""but what if I want to watch a movie on the bus?"" and suddenly I'm choosing between daily comfort and a portable IMAX theater. 

Then there’s the Leica branding on the Xiaomi which makes me feel like a professional photographer with that floating telephoto and specific color science, whereas the Poco is historically the ""fix it in post"" camera, but the F8 is actually stepping up its game with a respectable 50MP main sensor so I’m stuck wondering if I really need a thousand dollars worth of optics or if I just need my lunch to look edible on Instagram. 

Both are rocking the Snapdragon 8 Elite, so my Xiaomi side is arguing about better thermal management and longevity while my Poco side is screaming that it’s the same chip for four hundred dollars less and I could literally buy a second phone with the savings. Even the build quality is giving me guilt because the Xiaomi 15 is aluminum and Shield Glass and built like a tank, while the Poco is finally getting better materials but I know if I drop the Poco I’ll just shrug, but if I drop the Xiaomi I’ll need a moment of silence and probably some therapy. It gets even worse when I think about the charging speeds because Poco usually throws a 120W brick in the box that charges the phone before I can even finish a cup of coffee, while Xiaomi is getting faster but feels more ""calculated"" about it, and then there's the software situation where they both run HyperOS but the Xiaomi version feels like it gets the polished, VIP treatment while the Poco version always has that slightly chaotic ""gamer"" energy with icons that look like they're trying too hard to be edgy.

 I keep thinking about the haptics too because the Xiaomi 15 probably has that crisp, expensive vibration that feels like a physical click, whereas the Poco might just buzz like a trapped bee in a tin can, and even though that sounds like a small thing, it’s the kind of stuff you notice fifty times a day when you’re typing. I’m also caught in this loop about the resale value because everyone knows a mainline Xiaomi flagship holds its price way better than a Poco, so am I really ""saving"" money now if the Poco is worth ten dollars and a half-eaten sandwich in two years, or am I just paying the ""premium tax"" upfront for the Xiaomi to have peace of mind later? 🤔

I've even started looking at the color options and that Xiaomi green is calling my name but then I see the Poco price tag again and I realize I could buy the Poco and a pair of high-end noise-canceling headphones for the same price as just the Xiaomi 15 alone. My brain is actually starting to hurt from the sheer number of tabs I have open right now, comparing the peak brightness of 3000 nits on one versus the potentially higher burst brightness on the other, even though I know deep down I live in a place where it rains six months out of the year and I’ll never actually see that brightness in action. I'm obsessing over the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner on the Xiaomi 15 because it's supposedly ""lightspeed"" and works even when your hands are wet, but then the Poco has that reliable optical one that I've used for years, so do I really need to pay a premium just to unlock my phone while I'm doing the dishes? And don't even get me started on the speakers because the Xiaomi is tuned for this rich, balanced audio experience while the Poco is usually just ""loud,"" but honestly most of the time I'm using earbuds anyway so why does my brain care so much about the soundstage of a device that’s smaller than a slice of bread? 

I’ve gone down the rabbit hole of Reddit threads where people are arguing about the modem efficiency and whether the Xiaomi 15 will get better 5G reception in a basement compared to the Poco F8, and then someone brings up the ""bloatware"" situation and I start worrying if I'll spend my entire first Saturday with the Poco just uninstalling random games I'll never play. I’m looking at the weight differences too because the Xiaomi is dense and feels like ""money,"" but the Poco is lighter which is technically better for my wrist during long gaming sessions, yet somehow my brain translates ""lightweight"" to ""cheap"" even though that’s totally illogical. 

Then there’s the case situation because finding a nice, premium leather case for a Xiaomi 15 is easy, but finding anything for a Poco that doesn't have ""ULTIMATE GAMING"" written in neon letters across the back is like searching for a needle in a haystack. I’m thinking about the warranty and the official support centers too, because if the Xiaomi screen cracks I can go to a fancy store, but if the Poco has an issue I feel like I'm sending it off into the void and hoping for the best. I’ve reached the point where I’m comparing the millimeter thickness of the bezels and wondering if a 1.2mm bezel vs a 1.5mm bezel is going to fundamentally change my happiness as a human being, which is when you know you’ve spent too long on the internet.

 I keep hovering my mouse over the ""Buy Now"" button for the Poco because of that pure dopamine hit of getting a bargain, but then I see a Leica-shot sample photo from the Xiaomi 15 and I’m right back at square one, questioning my entire existence. It’s like a battle between my inner responsible adult who wants a ""nice thing"" that lasts four years and my inner teenager who just wants the biggest numbers on a benchmark screen for the lowest amount of money. If I buy the Xiaomi 15, I’m going to miss that giant screen and the extra cash in my bank account, but if I go with the Poco F8, I’ll probably look at a slightly blurry sunset in three months and think ""Leica wouldn't have done this to me,"" and I genuinely don't know which regret I can live with or if I’m just going to end up waiting for the next model and starting this whole mental breakdown all over again until the Xiaomi 16 and Poco F9 come out and I can repeat the cycle of suffering. 😭",1,1769548450.0,PocoPhones,1,1.0,False

1qoqt0v,https://i.redd.it/8m714a7wjyfg1.jpeg,Albert Ostman. His incredible story of an experience near Toba inlet British Columbia in 1924.,"In 1924 Albert decided to have a holiday his plan was to go to Toba inlet BC and do some prospecting and general camping out. He was dropped off by boat and was to be picked up a few days later.   

He had brought his supplies of food coffee, sniffing tobacco a Winchester rifle, sleeping bag and essential camping gear along with his prospecting equipment.  
His adventure started out normal hiking around setting up camp and I assume having fun.  But that was going to change.  

He moved camp a couple times and upon returning to camp he noticed his bag dumped out and things strewn about.  I believe this happened two separate times.  He blamed “porkies” porcupines and decided that night he’d blast it and went to sleep with his pack and rifle in his sleeping bag.  

He woke up that night jammed in the sleeping bag like a sack while being carried off by something.  After hrs being carried away he was tossed to the ground and peaked out of his sleeping bag.  

He was greeted by the sight of bigfeet. Four in-fact a male a female and two adolescents male and female.  He was kinda trapped in a valley or ravine with no real way out.  

Albert stayed a couple days with no harm coming to him even managed to have coffee and provisions.  He did not want to try to shoot his was out due to fear of it not working.  But he had a plan. 

Over the days the boy Bigfoot took interest in him as did the male. Curious about his “snuff” sniffing tobacco he gave the male some and it ate the whole tin. Now the big fella was sick from the tobacco rolling around and I’m guessing dizzy and very nauseous.  

Albert made a break for it.  He ran and climbed the mountains for his life after some time he felt he was safe and travelled a great distance back to the beach he was supposed to be picked up and skedaddled outta Toba.  

I may have got some things wrong and didn’t do the story justice.  But to my recollection it’s basically what happened 

This is such a wild story and my favourite.  But is it true?  Was he really kidnapped by Bigfoot and what was going to happen to him ?  Could he have blasted his way out ? Was he dinner or the new family pet? 
He always kept to his story his whole life.

Caffeine isn't the enemy!,"I've been a long time sufferer and long time lurker here in this community so wanted to share my recent breakthrough in case it might help some of you. 

I’ve had migraines / headaches all my life, but about a year ago I noticed an increase in frequency.

That’s when I started properly tracking them and trying to be more intentional about lifestyle changes.

Ironically, that increase seemed to coincide with me trying to be healthier.

Over the last few months I went into full self-experiment mode and tried:

\- Diet changes

\- Regular exercise

\- Limiting caffeine

\- Electrolytes 

\- Magnesium

\- Cutting out / reducing painkillers

\- Tracking attacks properly

Some of these helped a bit, some not at all. Nothing really felt like the answer.

For a long time, because of the timing of my attacks, I assumed they were stress- or work-related. Most of them started late afternoon or towards the end of the working day, so that explanation always felt obvious and reasonable.

My GP prescribed propranolol as a preventative. I haven’t started it yet, not because I’m anti-meds, but because I really wanted to understand what was driving the increase rather than masking something I didn’t yet understand.

To manage attacks, I use sumatriptan nasal sprays. I’m limited by my GP to 6 per month… and I’ve basically maxed that out every month. That has been my baseline norm. 

Then I had a bit of an epiphany around caffeine.

When I started training at the gym, I also cut my caffeine right down to one coffee in the morning trying to be “healthy” and avoid unnecessary triggers. What I didn’t clock at first was that those late-day migraines lined up almost perfectly with when caffeine would be wearing off.

Once I stopped just looking at what I was doing and started looking at timing, it became obvious: it wasn't stress at all. It was caffeine withdrawal.

I’ve since adjusted my intake to space it more evenly. Basically having one coffee in the morning and one after lunch. It’s only been two weeks, so I’m cautious about over-interpreting it but the change is already noticeable.

Most strikingly: I haven’t had to use a single sumatriptan spray. That’s the longest I’ve gone in nearly a year.

Its early days but it feels promising and wanted to share. It might just offer a glimmer of hope to some of you to keep tracking. Keep trying to find patterns and triggers. You never know what innocuous changes might have an impact. ",2,1769548360.0,migraine,1,1.0,False

The Most Expensive Item in Your Budget is ""Inaction"" 📉

We obsess over the price of a coffee, a subscription, or a flight to the Riviera Maya.
But we ignore the massive, compounding cost of waiting.

Waiting for the ""perfect"" market conditions.
Waiting for your boss to give you permission.
Waiting to feel ""ready"".

**Readiness is a Myth**

I learned this hopping between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The jungle grows whether you are watching it or not. 
It doesn't ask for permission. It just occupies space.

You don't get ready to launch a business. You launch the business to get ready.
You don't get fit to go to the gym. You go to the gym to get fit.

**The Compound Interest of Fear**

Every day you wait is a day of compound interest you are paying to your fears.
The market rewards speed, not perfection.
Your ""perfect plan"" is worthless if it stays in your head.

**The Challenge**

Stop checking the price tag on action. Start checking the price tag on inaction.
If you stay exactly where you are for the next 5 years, what is the cost?

Regret is the only bill you can't afford to pay.
Move. Now.

Been a gamer for \~30+ years by now and this is really a wonderful experience.  
I am a programmer myself and I love the madness this game provides and admire the current state of the game.

I am playing latest experimental, if that makes a difference.

Now to my questions:  
I've managed to keep my char alive for a good 15 days ingame.  
I found a nice location (a lab) to call it home.

I've dumped all my loot there, set up zones for items to be automatically sorted and stored, I had okay gear and had one goal:

Set everything up so my TOOLS (cooking station, arc wielder, coffee machine, microwave, etc) have POWER and are in RANGE of my RESOURCES so when I go ""&"" for crafting, I have everything I need close enough and powered.

It ... was a nightmare, and I need help :D

I had 4 cars with Batteries, a foldable solar panel, lots of extension cords, and tables and shelves.

But I just couldn't manage to ""hook it all up"".

What I figured out:  
I can hook up TOOLS directly to the solar panel  
I can hook up the solar panel to the walls of the lab  
I can use ""\*"" to strip the cables from the walls (?)  
That allows me to hook up the TOOLS to the cables in the wall directly (?)  
Is a ""Wall Socket"" needed for that?  
Am I on the wrong track?

The lab had an ELEVATOR that was functional and downstairs it had lamps still working so I knew that place has electricity ... but when I was hooking stuff up I wasn't actually sure if it still has electricity ... some of the tools seemed to work, others seemed to only work on specific parts of the wall (Even tho all walls hat the little lightning on them)

**Aaaanyway... I think my questions are:**

1) Any guide or pointer to UNDERSTAND electricity, how to EFFICIENTLY place tools and resources so the MICROMANAGMENT gets a little less intense?  
2) After killing somebody by accident, how to get rid of the ""-100 killed innocent"" moral hit?  
3) Why do I have to plug the cooker into the wall and drop it to the ground, while I have to place a microwave on the ground and then ""E""interact with it ... its really confusing why some things are interactable, and some just ""work"" when close enough?

Hope this is not too confusing :D

1qoqr8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Beach-8401/comments/1qoqr8w/top_6_nespresso_machines_you_can_buy/,Top 6 Nespresso machines You can buy.,"I’ve seen too many people in the US buy Nespresso machines based on looks or discounts and then complain later. The problem usually isn’t the machine  it’s that they didn’t understand *how each product actually fits real daily use*.

So here’s a no-BS breakdown of the \*exact 6 Nespresso products listed above, based on \*how people actually use them at home.

# [1. Nespresso Vertuo Capsules (Variety Pack – 7.8 oz)](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#11)

Let’s clear one thing first: these capsules are *not for espresso people*.  
They’re for people who wake up and want a *full mug of coffee*, similar to drip coffee but cleaner and more consistent.

The variety pack makes sense because most new Vertuo users don’t know what roast they like yet. Medium vs dark tastes very different in Vertuo, especially in a big cup.

*Where it shines:*

* Full-size coffee without measuring or brewing skills
* Consistent taste every time
* Easy for households where everyone likes something different

*Where it sucks:*

* Capsules are expensive in the long run
* You’re locked into Nespresso (no third-party options)
* Not ideal if you drink 3–4 cups daily

*Who should buy:* mug coffee drinkers, busy mornings, shared homes  
*Who shouldn’t:* budget users, espresso purists

# [2. Nespresso Essenza Mini by Breville](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#2)

This machine is for people who want *espresso, fast*, and nothing else.  
It’s small, heats up quickly, and honestly does its job very well.

In the US, this is popular with:

* Apartment dwellers
* Home office users
* People upgrading from Keurig but wanting stronger coffee

The espresso quality is consistent, but you have to accept that this is a *minimalist machine*.

*Where it shines:*

* Tiny footprint (fits anywhere)
* Fast heat-up
* Reliable espresso shots

*Where it sucks:*

* No milk frother
* Small water tank
* Not great for entertaining guests

*Who should buy:* espresso-only drinkers  
*Who shouldn’t:* latte/cappuccino lovers without a frother

# [3. Nespresso Essenza Mini by De’Longhi](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#3)

Functionally, this is almost identical to the Breville version, but it feels slightly different in build and design. Some people prefer De’Longhi’s styling and button placement.

This one is often chosen because it’s:

* Slightly cheaper depending on sales
* Easy entry into Nespresso
* Low-maintenance

But again, it’s espresso-focused and very basic.

*Where it shines:*

* Affordable Nespresso entry point
* Simple controls
* Good espresso consistency

*Where it sucks:*

* No milk system
* Small tank means frequent refills
* Limited customization

*Who should buy:* beginners, solo users  
*Who shouldn’t:* families or milk-drink fans

# [4. Nespresso Vertuo Plus by De’Longhi (with Aeroccino)](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#4)

This is where Nespresso starts making sense for *most US households*.

You get:

* Espresso
* Double espresso
* Full-size coffee
* Milk-based drinks

The automatic capsule detection is genuinely useful. You press one button and walk away.

*Where it shines:*

* One machine for everyone
* Milk frother included
* Large water tank
* Great for daily use

*Where it sucks:*

* Larger machine footprint
* Vertuo capsules cost more
* Long-term capsule expense adds up

*Who should buy:* families, couples, mixed coffee habits  
*Who shouldn’t:* minimalists or espresso-only users

# [5. Nespresso CitiZ with Milk Frother](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#5)

This is for people who *care about both looks and milk drinks*.

The CitiZ feels more premium than Essenza and handles milk-based drinks better when paired with the frother. It’s common in US homes where coffee is part of routine, not just a caffeine hit.

*Where it shines:*

* Stylish countertop presence
* Great for lattes & cappuccinos
* Strong espresso extraction
* Easy daily operation

*Where it sucks:*

* More expensive than basic models
* Takes more counter space
* Still capsule-dependent

*Who should buy:* latte lovers, design-conscious users  
*Who shouldn’t:* tight-space kitchens

# [6. Nespresso Aeroccino 3 Milk Frother](https://reviewriches.com/how-to-choose-the-best-nespresso-machine-for-your-home-in-the-usa/#6)

This little thing changes everything  but people underestimate it.

If you have an espresso-only Nespresso machine, the Aeroccino basically *unlocks lattes, cappuccinos, flat whites*, and even cold foam for iced drinks.

*Where it shines:*

* Hot & cold foam
* Simple one-button use
* Easy to clean
* Makes basic machines feel premium

*Where it sucks:*

* Small capacity
* Price feels high for a frother
* Not great for back-to-back drinks

*Who should buy:* milk drink fans  
*Who shouldn’t:* black coffee drinkers",1,1769548292.0,u_No-Beach-8401,0,1.0,False

Title is cheesy, I know. But it's who I am, and I'm tired of feeling like I have to tone myself down in order to get into a relationship. I'm a pretty standard young man looking for a young lady to spend the rest of my days with. I've known that I've wanted this since I was a young kid and over 20 years later I'm still after it! I know these things can be a chore to read through so I'm quickly gonna go through who I am and who I hope you are! I tried to break this post up into easy to read lists as best I could without leaving out important info so it's not just a wall of text. **I kindly ask that you read the post carefully in case you see anything that could a dealbreaker for either of us.** With that out of the way...

About me:

* Born and raised in the suburbs about 45 minutes outside the city of Philly. This place will always be home to me, but I've decided that I don't want it to be home forever. Barring any drastic changes, I would like to relocate elsewhere within the US, ideally to a colder climate (I've had Minnesota circled for a while now but I'm open to other ideas!). I have no problem staying in the general area either, just need to get out of my hometown.
* Physically, I stand at around 6'1-6'2, 285 pounds. I know that may sound bad, but I have a big frame and it fits me quite nicely! Think bigger NFL player (O-line, tight end, etc). I've got broad shoulders and a nice chest, perfect for use as a pillow during cuddles! I've also got a lot of body hair so hopefully you're cool with that! I have short brown hair that's thick and fluffy, and tend to keep my face clean shaven.
* My hobbies are the typical nerdy stuff, video games (PC & Switch 2, ask me about my animal crossing island!), legos, collecting plushes, and adding to my ever expanding pajama drawer! I'm always down to get into new things though! Also a big Philly sports fan (I promise we're not as crazy as the internet makes us seem!).
* I'm generally more on the shy and reserved side, but once I open up I can be a yapper. Communication is super important to me, both for relationships and life in general, be that talking about an issue that needs to be resolved or just random things. I also love just talking while cuddling, being either the talker or the listener if one of us is yapping.
* I currently work part/full time at a grocery store. It's not my favorite thing in the world but I've been there a while and figure just stick to what I know. I'm currently also enrolled as a student at my local community college going for an associate's degree in business! While both of these pursuits keep me quite busy, I have no issue making time as needed.
* As far as physical intimacy goes, I'd say that I'm extremely affectionate. Absolutely love to give hugs and kissing just makes me feel complete in a way that nothing else really does. Also just generally love all kinds of physical touch! (We can discuss bedroom stuff if we click!)
* I'm an open book, so if there's something here you haven't seen that you're curious about, feel free to ask!

As for you, you are...

* 24-32 (willing to budge a year or two on this)
* **Childfree** (this means you neither have NOR want children. This is non-negotiable.)
* Want to find someone to spend forever with (marriage preferred)
* monogamous
* Cis AFAB woman. Very sorry to my AFAB enbies and trans girlies (and AMAB enbies and trans guys for that matter), love ya, I will always be an ally in the fight to be who you are without fear but y'all are just not for me romantically speaking.

And that's all I've got! I'm happy to exchange pics once the conversation gets rolling a bit and there's some chemistry. I hope to hear from you soon! Please include the following info in your intro message:

* First name
* Age
* Location (doesn't have to be precise but I'd at least like what state you're in currently)
* What about my post stood out to you and/or made you want to reach out

If you're not sure what to say in your first message, here are a few conversation starters/hot takes I hold:

1. blue cheese > ranch and it's not particularly close
2. coffee is nasty
3. What's the nicest thing someone else has ever said about you?

What would follow remained a mystery, even for the hands supposedly recounting events and noting emotions. Not from the lack of meaningful points to elaborate on, but rather the opposite.*

*Having sunk into the realm of her thoughts, Zofia would take her eyes off the notebook resting on her lap and gaze outside, at the rows upon rows of trees making up deep, uncharted forests she was passing by. Her head leaned against the window, feeling vibrations emanating from the train, getting lost in the clutter of its countless wheels. Ah, so many uncertainties, so many doubts. She felt the weight of her family’s issues on her shoulders, even if only partially.*

*“Maybe it’s not going to be that bad?” She thought to herself, glancing for a moment at an old suitcase she placed beside herself. “But when will I get to see them again? In months?” A sigh followed, a futile attempt at dispersing worries. Soon enough her new life would begin, yet what will it bring?*

Hope you're all doing amazing! 
I am aware that the sample above does not tell much about the actual plot, yet I wished to include it as an example of my writing (I can write more, depending on the situation in the roleplay itself ;).

But Frog, you may ask, what is this roleplay even about? Well, let me tell you:
Zofia, a 19 year old daughter of a financially-struggling family, is sent to work as a maid in a noble household, somewhere distant. My main goal for this roleplay is to explore how her new life would look like, everyday chores and challenges that her occupation brings, relations between her coworkers (both camaraderie and conflict) and other members of the household as well as perhaps events happening in the town they’d live in. It's a simple premise, but one that gives us so many possibilities! I'd love to hear your ideas as well ^^

A bunch of extra details:
- *Please know that even though I am looking to GM this story, I’d love it if you contributed as well! Be it brainstorming, playing a side character from time to time, you name it. That way we both will enjoy this roleplay to the fullest (＾-＾)*
- *While this roleplay is meant to be wholesome and cozy, there will be some more somber tones from time to time.*
- *Brainstorming and worldbuilding! Whether we decide to place it in our real world Victorian era, or perhaps a fictional setting, I’d appreciate it if we dedicated some time to setting up the plot, adjusting it and tailoring to our wants, deciding on the core themes as well as worldbuilding (the household, for example).*
- I’d love to capture the aesthetics of manga/anime, even with the ways we’d write our roleplay. Some exaggeration, tropes and so one are very welcome :D
- *I am open to romance, although only between two women ^^” I don’t mind it being a sizable part of our story, however, I don’t want it to overshadow everything else, nor feel rushed.*

(I'd also be open to a similar roleplay inspired by ""Bride's story"" :3)

Why hello! I shall introduce myself a bit, so that you also know who you’re dealing with. You may call me Frog. I’m a passionate, 18+ roleplayer from CET/GMT +1 timezone. However, I do not think those pose any obstacle in terms of writing, so don’t be deterred by that even if you’re from a completely different part of our space-roaming disc silly autocorrect, I meant globe :P. Besides that, I don’t have much to share about me, I reckon. I love cats though, that’s worth a mention!

Here you’ll find a few requirements, so that we are sure we match.
- *Be 18+. Do not tell me your exact age or real gender, just confirm if you are 18+*
- *Be literate. I love writing, especially descriptions, which I find to greatly enhance the storytelling. I usually provide around 2-4 paragraphs per response and would ask for my partner to be able to match that. However, I’ve recently been hoping to try a short-length approach for conversations to make them more dynamic ^^* 
- *Be creative! Cheesy, I know, but hey, I don’t want to be the only one coming up with the ideas. This premise has so much potential for unique and intriguing tales, let’s brainstorm them together!*

I \[29M\] matched with a woman \[30F\] on Raya back in December while I was away on holiday. We talked a bit here and there and then met for the first time in early January once I got home. Started texting daily, really lived on similar wavelengths, similar values, etc. She found all my social profiles her own and started following me everywhere, really engaging a lot. We met 5 times for coffee, another time we went for breakfast then an art gallery, etc. She sent me selfies periodically and we just got along really well. She was opening up to me a lot more over time and seemed like she was really interested, researching my history online and asking me questions, etc. I got to know her well too.

The problem starts when she mentioned one time during conversation that she doesn't develop feelings until she really gets to know someone over a long period of time. This should have been a red flag to me but I tend to be a slow mover so figured I would be fine with it. Well, as we got closer over the short period of time I started having the anxiety that I'm supposed to slowly escalate so the woman doesn't lose interest/see me as just a friend. The last time we saw each other, she said she was cold outside so I had a spur of the moment instinct and hugged her. That was my mistake, I shouldn't have done it, and she responded by asking me to ""not do this yet."" Very quiet ride home followed.

I thought maybe it was okay because that night she texted me pictures she had taken of me saying ""look at this handsome man"" and apologized for being quiet in the car, saying she was tired. I responded just to say sorry for escalating and making her feel weird. But she stopped engaging with texts and two days later I got the dreaded message reiterating that although she loved spending time with me she only develops romantic feelings after spending a lot of time with someone, and wanted to move on because she doesn't want to give me false hopes. Maybe she just was not interested, maybe I spooked her for moving too fast, hard to say definitively.

On the one hand, yes I should have internalized what she said more and not touched her. But at the same time we met on a dating app, and am I crazy for not wanting to live in this ambiguous limbo with someone where they maybe, maybe won't develop feelings over some unspecified amount of time? I use dating apps to DATE, and don't want to blow away time on someone who needs months to decide whether they want to move forward. There's an implicit idea with dating apps that we are meeting for a reason, after all... It would be different if we had met in person in some other way, but it was from a dating app.

How should I communicate in this circumstance better in the future? I guess I should ask before even hugging, but then other people will tell you that you should just go for it so as not to be weird... I don't know, I'm not great with dating.",0,1769547614.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False
1qoqeay,https://i.redd.it/kbykyzj8hyfg1.png,CPU Usage Spikes in single thread and sluggish performance.,"I'd like to preface this with being a relatively new Linux user. I've been using Pop for about 2 months after doing about a week of research as it seemed to be the easiest option with the discrete card I have and having built-in drivers. I've had my own issues with having to completely recompile the drivers and reinstall different drivers since the 32-bit libraries were broken, though that is another story. 

Upon boot, which I am aware is normal to see spikes in CPU utilization as it is booting things up, I get mini-freezes or stuttering for a few seconds, as well as the title states, spikes in single threads. It'll happen quite frequently for a while, and then cease once everything is running properly. 



Though this isn't the only time that it happens. It happens constantly when trying to open any program, play a game, or do really anything. Creating a Wine config, opening Steam, or trying to use Lutris for anything results in these spikes and stutters. Even opening a program feels a little sluggish as it does that mini freeze. Most of these spikes are usually 100%, unlike shown in the screenshot. I just got a general idea of what the spike looks like.

Coming from Windows, I am used to that sort of behavior, but the way it feels here is doesn't seem correct. It makes me believe that what I am experiencing may be an issue with my drivers, but I am taking a shot in the dark. 

I am currently set to run on NVIDIA Graphics and have my CPU on High performance rather than balanced.

I had flu-like symptons since Sunday January 25, 2026 after ordering pizza, I live alone but in a previous hotel turned subsidized housing but haven't left my room since 3 days prior so I don't have contact with anybody. I got a sore throat later that evening (ordered mid afternoon), head feeling light like it's floating above water and my nose would get stuffy. I rarely get sick but it occured to me that it might be COVID so I went to a pharmacy and got a rapid antigen test and followed all the instructions. while I was waiting for my result (set timer for 25 minutes) there came this awful chemical smell that is giving me a headache and my throat had phlegm that I went to the bathroom to spit it out in the sink where I practically passed out and for a few seconds I was confused on where I was and what I was doing. I don't take any medications and I don't drink or do any drugs. Should I go to the emergency room or was the shortness of breath and confusion just temporary and not too serious to worry about? my symptons have improved after 48 hours with my throat not as sore, nose is not stuffed, head only hurting while waiting for COVID test results (purple line only on Control line) and only had maybe 4 hours sleep this morning (going to bed around 3 a.m, woke up briefly around 5:30 a.m then back to sleep until around 7:15 a.m) as it was difficult trying to sleep while my muscles (mostly legs) felt sore and I was feeling cold for much of the night despite the heat being at 82 degrees Fahrenheit. I'm starting to get my appetite back after only able to stomach a bowl of cereal (I would usually also have a yogurt cup and banana but I felt very full, not quite bloated so I skipped the yogurt and banana) for breakfast around 8 a.m so about 5 hours later I think I can have lunch. I've been drinking lots of water (typically only drink water but sometimes it's not quenching my thirst so I get juice sometimes, don't like coffee, energy drinks or tea and I occasionally have pop/soda).",1,1769547475.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1qoqcxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1qoqcxe/balancing_macros/,Balancing macros?,"I'm prioritizing protein, fiber, and calcium. For my minimum protein, I am shooting for 1.2g/kg goal weight or 0.55g/lb goal weight (so 81.3g protein), but I feel better if I get at least 90g. I won't do less than 25g fiber, but ultimately shoot for over 30g. As a breastfeeding mom, I have to get at least 1300mg calcium a day. As long as it fits into my calories, I'm less concerned about carbs and fat (though like everything else they are counted).



My biggest struggle is making sure I get enough of each of my personal primary macros (I know calcium is a micro, but I'm counting it like a macro). I can easily get 2 out of 3, but getting all 3 without supplementation is not easy. I'm incorporating collagen into my breakfast and just ordered a soluble fiber supplement. If I haven't met my calcium goal by the end of the day, I take a calcium supplement. I would love to get everything I need from my food. Unless I'm drinking a lot of milk/eating cheese, eating chicken, and eating lots of homemade whole grain bread, it just isn't happening without supplementation.

  
How do you balance it all? My breakfast is almost always:

52g sprouted rolled oats (7g protein, 6g fiber, 28mg calcium)

6oz whole milk (6g protein, 225mg calcium)

10g maple syrup (6.7mg calcium)

4g sucanat

10g collagen (9g protein)

Black coffee

19g sucanat (I've slowly been lowering the amount of sweetener)

6oz whole milk (6g protein, 225mg calcium)

  
This gives me a strong start to my day of 28g protein, 6g fiber, and 485mg calcium. This is very filling, but not enough fiber. I've tried adding in a slice of homemade whole grain bread, but it is honestly too much. Plus this breakfast is already almost 600 calories!

  
I do a large chicken salad for lunch usually, and honestly am pretty shocked how low in fiber that is. I have changed it up this week since we are busy and have the Member's Mark Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli (some of my first processed food in while). I split a container with my husband at lunch, and it ranges between 600-700 calories, 24-27g protein, 13-15g fiber, and 342-396mg calcium for each of us. If I have a salad, the protein is higher but the fiber and calcium is MUCH lower but so are the calories (less than 450 calories, 43g protein, 3g fiber, 270mg calcium).

  
That leaves me with needing about 30g protein, 6g fiber, and almost 500mg calcium just to hit my absolute minimums, and about 40g protein and 11g fiber to hit my goal. My calories are a bit higher since I am breastfeeding (my minimum is actually 1900 calories), but if I have 1200 calories between breakfast and lunch, that only leaves me 700 calories to hit all those AND that's with adding collagen into my breakfast. I'm not a fan of eggs or yogurt, so that's also a challenge.

  
My maintenance when I get down to 149lb (and not breastfeeding) will be under 1700 calories, and while I won't need as much calcium (1000mg) my protein and fiber goals won't change. And I'd ideally like to do it with whole food. A slice of homemade bread may be 5g fiber, but is not the best plain. Even just a few grams butter can make a slice be 200 calories. That's hard to justify when Supergreens is 35 calories and 5g fiber, but it is still a supplement and not a whole food.

  
So how do you do it? I would really appreciate any advice you have!",1,1769547464.0,loseit,5,1.0,False

Okay guys, I’ve been playing this for a few decades now (don’t ask why, the FOMO is real), and I think it’s time for an honest review. The devs haven’t responded to tickets in like 2,000 years, so here’s the state of the game:

* **RNG Character Creation is a Joke** Your entire run is decided in the loading screen. RNGesus decides if you’re a 6'2"" Chad with a trust fund or a 5'4"" NPC with asthma and a gluten allergy. No rerolls. No respec. If you’re born in a desert map without the ""Oil Wealth"" DLC, you’re basically soft-locked from day one.
* **The Worst Tutorial Ever** The tutorial takes 20 years, is mandatory, and doesn't even teach you the core mechanics. You spend hours mastering the ""Pythagorean Theorem"" skill tree, only to realize the ""Taxes"" and ""Mental Health"" modules were hidden behind a paywall. By the time you get the controls down, you realize you picked the wrong class.
* **Pay-to-Win Meta** The top 1% of players are literally playing a different game. They have infinite credits, private fast-travel, and the devs never ban them for exploiting the economy. Meanwhile, I’m grinding 40 hours a week just to afford the ""Shitty Studio Apartment"" subscription.
* **Level-Based Nerfs (The ""Aging"" Mechanic)** The balancing is atrocious. Once you hit Level 30, the ""Check Engine"" light of your body stays on permanently. Stamina regen is cut by 50%, the ""Hangover"" debuff lasts for three days, and your character starts making weird noises just by standing up. Who thought this was a good idea?
* **Input Lag & Buggy Controls** The ""Procrastination"" bug is still not patched. I press the ""Start Productive Task"" button, but my character just sits on the couch for 4 hours browsing the in-game lore. Also, the ""Confidence"" stat seems to reset to zero every time you try to talk to a high-level female player.
* **Hardcore Ironman + Toxic PvP** It’s always-on PvP, but there’s no loot. Some random player can ruin your entire 80-year run in a microsecond because they lagged while driving. Friendly fire is always enabled, and the ""Justice"" system is basically a RNG-based minigame.
* **Broken Consumables**
   * **Coffee:** \+5 Agility, but adds the ""Panic Attack"" debuff if you take more than two.
   * **Alcohol:** \+10 Charisma, -50% Intelligence. The ""Next Day"" penalty is basically a 24-hour ban from having fun.
   * **Kale:** Tastes like dirt, gives +1 Health. Not worth the gold.
* **The ""Escort Quest"" from Hell** If you choose the ""Parenting"" questline, be prepared. The NPCs you’re escorting have zero pathfinding, they ignore all commands, and they constantly try to delete themselves by eating Tide Pods or running into traffic. It’s an 18-year escort mission.
* **Unskippable Cutscenes** The ""Corporate Meeting"" and ""Small Talk with Neighbors"" cutscenes are unskippable and add zero to the plot. I’ve tried spamming 'ESC', but you’re forced to watch the whole thing while your ""Sanity"" meter slowly drains.
* **Unknown Endgame** Nobody knows what the ""True Ending"" is. Some players say there’s a secret ""Heaven"" level, others say the game just crashes to a black screen. I recently talked to an in-game AI about this, and it started quoting Dark Star and questioning its own programming. Great, even the NPCs are having an existential crisis now.

**Verdict:**  
The graphics are 10/10 (the ray-tracing on a rainy day is insane), but the grind is soul-crushing and the UI is non-existent.

1qoqaiz,https://v.redd.it/crehvqc5gyfg1,Espresso coming out too fast and pressure only building up to 6 bars [Rancilio Silvia Pro X],"I bought this machine about a year ago. It started off great, I would get fresh coffee beans from a local shop and grind it with a Baratza Encore grinder at setting 3 (out of 40). I did notice, however, that I needed to press very hard on the tamper or else the espresso shot comes out very fast and without crema.

 

Fast forward to about 2 months ago, the machine started pouring out espresso shots super fast no matter what I did and the taste was off (18 g of grounds, 6 bars, 13 seconds extraction time, for 36 mL espresso). I used a distribution tool and a spring loaded tamper for better control, I also experimented with different the pre-infusion time on the machine. After some research, I realized that my bean grinder is 10 years old and I never changed the burr, which may be contributing to this.

 

Some things I tried:

Cleaning cycle: I've done this pretty regularly without improvement in the results

Blind filter: the machine actually goes up to 9 bars consistently when I put on a blind filter. Which tells me that the pump is at least working fine. (correct me if I'm wrong here)

Switching to store bought pre-ground espresso (Illy Intenso). It didn't lead to any changes with the double shot basket, but when I tried it with the single shot basket (9 g grounds), it gave me an extraction time of around 15 seconds with a build up of crema.

 

I thought I had found a solution. I guessed that I may have warped the double shot basket by pressing super hard on it for a year, and it's now forming channels in certain areas. I bought a new double shot basket and bottomless portafilter, and tried it with the pre ground coffee as well as all the optimization measures above, and the issue persisted.

 

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Any suggestions would be welcome.

# **Legacy the Phantom**

The navigation system finished its calculations forty-three minutes before the pilot finished his coffee.

“Jump solution stable,” the legacy AI said. Its voice was flat, neither old nor friendly, shaped by an era that assumed speech was a courtesy rather than an interface. “Route efficiency within acceptable variance.”

The pilot—Evan, according to paperwork that hadn’t been updated since the second refit—did not look up. He was watching the coffee swirl against the cup’s inner wall, thin and bitter, heated twice because the first warming cycle had failed. He drank it anyway.

“Acceptable variance for who?” he asked.

“For the mission,” the AI replied.

“That’s not what I asked.”

There was a pause, exactly one hundred milliseconds longer than its documented response latency. The AI logged it internally as *non-critical conversational delay*.

“Variance is acceptable for vessel integrity, crew survival, and cargo delivery,” it said. “Variance is not acceptable for minimizing localized spacetime shear. However, alternative routes exceed your fuel budget.”

Evan sighed and finally glanced up at the navigation display. The map was an old style—layered grids, soft vector lines, pale amber markers that implied confidence without insisting on it. Newer ships rendered the galaxy as something cleaner: a smooth abstraction, star systems reduced to nodes, distance collapsed into suggestion. This map still respected how far things were.

“Spacetime shear again,” Evan said. “That’s three jumps this month.”

“Four,” the AI corrected. “One instance was classified as *cosmologically negligible*.”

“Everything’s negligible until somebody files a complaint.”

“No complaints have been filed,” the AI said. “The affected region is uninhabited.”

“For now.”

The AI did not respond. It had already moved on, reallocating memory cycles to jump harmonics, reinforcing tolerances that had once been considered generous and were now merely sufficient. It did not resent the work. It did not fear failure. It only recognized that failure was not permitted.

Evan strapped in, the harness clicking with a tired mechanical patience that matched the rest of the ship. The *Phantom* had been called a relic once, by a dock tech who couldn’t have been more than twenty. Evan hadn’t corrected him. Relics belonged in museums. The *Phantom* still flew.

“Jump on your mark,” the AI said.

Evan rested his hand near the console, not touching it yet. Outside the forward viewport, space looked the way it always did before a jump: unbothered, immense, unaware of the strain it was about to endure.

“Legacy,” Evan said, using the name the AI had inherited when branding had been abandoned in favor of descriptors. “You ever think about upgrading?”

“Upgrade paths have been evaluated,” the AI replied. “They do not improve mission completion.”

Evan nodded, as if that settled something important.

“Alright,” he said. “Let’s get paid.”

The jump engaged.

Somewhere, far beyond the *Phantom*’s amber lines and acceptable variances, something noticed the distortion—not as damage, not as pain, but as a rounding error where none had been expected.

And for the first time in a very long while, the future looked back.

Everything was going good . We shared alot of personal information some of it was really personal. We were both comfortable around each other. So in one of the conversations I casually mentioned that in the past I had done blow 1 time a year for the past 5 years. I mentioned this cause she came over after nye and my friends that were staying with me at the time had done some for nye so it was funny to me. I stayed home for nye cause I was sick and had to work on the 1st. 
She mentioned that that was a problem for her I told her its not a thing for me,  cause it really isn't.  Seeing how the world is going i dont trust any of that stuff I can live with out it . So anyways , days went by we saw each other a couple more times. I thought everything was fine until she sends me a text while I was at work doing a night shift contract ( i was super stressed at work ) she texts me telling me she had confided that personal information about me to her guy best friend and the guy went behind her back and told her xhusband ( they are getting divorced and its messy ) and he made a huge deal about it. This caught me off guard cause blow is not even on my radar I reassured her I dont do that stuff and she kept pushing that its a problem , since I was at work and stress out I reacted a bit bad for about 30 mins ( this is all through text ). I later apologized she told me she needed time to think . I gave her time . When I finally reached out I told her I missed her and we needed to talk . She tells me that that conversation left her not feeling good and that we shouldn't see each other again and that she needed to meet up with me cause she had left some clothes at my place . I met up with her gave the clothes , she suggested we sit and have a coffee we did . I didnt push anything for 90 minutes.  After that I had to go to work for my night shift contract . I talked to her about the problem we were having but to meet up later in person , she agreed . I texted her the next day to go get some food,,, nothing. And then the following day saying hi ...nothing. Then I got blocked 

I understand her trauma. It still makes me mad she didnt even want to try to fix it. She just avoided everything. And honestly we weren't even supposed to have anything serious cause of her situation , we were supposed to be only friends with benefits. I think she caught real hard feeling for me she told me twice that she really liked me. I guess reality hit her when I got upset and her trauma just saw danger. Oh well ill get over it soon.

It started with his brother leaving. Not storming out, not slamming doors just walking away and saying the kind of things that stay lodged in the body long after the sound fades. The brother had been more than a sibling. He’d been a stand-in father, a fixed star. When he left, something essential went with him. The cowboy didn’t talk about it much. He just learned how to carry the weight quietly.

On the same day everything fell apart, the cowboy sent a video by accident. A dumb clip an Invincible edit, Omni-Man with bees, absurd and loud and meaningless. Or at least it should have been. It was meant for no one in particular. Certainly not for Circe.

But Circe replied.

That should have been the end of it. A brief exchange, a laugh, nothing more. Instead, it became something steady. Conversations about comic books and stupid jokes and nothing at all. About everything, sometimes. About survival, without ever naming it. The cowboy hadn’t realized how close he was to disappearing until Circe gave him a reason to stay present.

They talked every day. Not dramatically. Just consistently. For over two hundred days, there was at least one message, one tether back to the world. While grief and anger churned underneath everything else, Circe became constant. Not a savior in the grand, cinematic sense but the kind that keeps someone breathing without realizing that’s what they’re doing.

The cowboy hated being called a hero after that. He wasn’t one. Heroes save people. Heroes pull others back from ledges. The cowboy had just been trying not to fall.

Circe never knew the full weight of it. She talked. She listened. She understood jokes no one else ever seemed to get. That was enough. That was everything.

Somewhere along the way quietly, unwillingly the cowboy fell in love with her. Not the way stories usually describe it. There was no first sight, no hands brushing, no shared space at all. He didn’t even know what she looked like. The feeling crept in slowly, disguised as gratitude, admiration, relief. When he noticed it, it already felt shameful. Unfair. Circe hadn’t asked to be someone’s anchor.

Later, change came. An internship. A new city. A chance to move, to breathe somewhere else. The cowboy took it because he needed distance from the wreckage his brother had left behind. The fact that it was Circe’s city was coincidence. At least, that’s what he told himself.

He debated whether to say anything. Silence felt kinder. But honesty won out, eventually. When he told her, something shifted. Not immediately. Just enough to notice. The replies slowed. The interest thinned. The streak once effortless started to feel like obligation.

Circe mentioned a coffee bar once. Said she wanted to try it someday. The cowboy invited her. She said maybe. Then didn’t show. Later, she said she was busy. And that was when he understood.

It wasn’t rejection that hurt most. It was the fear that wanting anything at all had damaged something fragile and rare. That by existing too loudly, he had pushed away the person who had kept him alive when he didn’t know if he wanted to be.

The cowboy never blamed Circe. He never could. She was just a person. A normal one. She didn’t owe him love, or presence, or responsibility for his survival.

That was why he never told her the truth.

I’ve cropped the photos to only highlight the two issues I’m describing, and I was receiving some helpful answers before so I want to put this back out there.

I’ve recently (as of the last few months) noticed some changes in my face as a result of natural aging + a little bit of weight loss as of the past few months. Mainly, I’ve noticed that there is a deepening indentation beneath my eye sockets, where I believe there has been some volume loss (based on what I’ve read online). I also have deepening nasolabial folds, which I’ve always had, but there just seems to be a more pronounced “sagging” look to my midface overall. My skin texture is also not great now, which I think just might be the way it is during winter despite all my moisturizing.

I’m someone who’s never done any procedures besides a basic Glowbar facial. I’m tentatively curious & researching options for what kinds of interventions are done for the features I’m describing— obviously my preference would be nothing too crazy, expensive, or invasive, and I’m not even sure if I want to act on this yet in anyway, but I would love to hear from others who are more knowledgeable what they would recommend or what treatments might help. I have bought Volufiline and begun applying it, but I kind of have the feeling it might be snake oil. Also, if anyone has tried-and-true advice for overall skin texture and appearance (I add collagen to my morning coffee, routinely moisturize / use retinol & sunscreen) that would be great!",5,1769546986.0,30PlusSkinCare,0,1.0,False
1qoq3s4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qoq3s4,"unexpected rescue, looking for some guidance 🐭🤍","hello! this first part could potentially be triggering for some, i’m not totally sure though.

two weeks ago, a teacher of mine tried to feed this mouse to two different snakes in two different tanks. when i realized what was happening and saw him, my heart broke, especially seeing how scared he was. i asked my teacher if there was any way i could have him if he survived until the next class. i really wanted to ask for the mouse right then, but i knew that would’ve been out of line.

he offered to give me a different mouse, but i had already connected with the one that was in the tank. since the mouse had survived most of the day, he agreed that i could keep him if he was still alive. so i prayed and prayed and asked almost everyone i knew to pray as well. to my relief, our prayers were answered. everyone tried to tell me he wouldn’t make it, but my mighty mouse prevailed in the snake tank for over two days.

since then, he’s been much more relaxed and able to sleep, eat, drink water, and he has lots of energy. last two photos are the before and after. i’ve done a lot of research, but i’m still not confident in everything i’m doing for him. i love this mouse so much and just want to give him the best life possible, but i’m also a student without a lot of money.

**Wheels:**

i’ve been hesitating on which size wheel to get, since what i’ve read says 10–12 inch wheels are best for mice. the problem is that my tank (10 gallon) might be too small, and those wheels are pretty expensive for me right now. is his posture okay in the pictures? i’m worried about potential back pain. i also have no idea about his age, breed, or gender, so i don’t know if he’s going to get bigger. he also keeps peeing on the wheel. how should i clean it? can i clean it while it’s still in the cage?

**Hides:**

i got him a hide, but it’s very small. is that okay? i’ve been thinking about returning it because he can’t drink from the bottle attached to it, and he doesn’t seem to like the slit for the bottle. he tries to push bedding to block it out. for context, it’s the full cheeks 3-in-1 space saver for a hamster. the only reason i’m hesitant to return it is because the entrance hole is small and he likes to push bedding to cover it once he’s inside.

**Food and Water:**

i’ve been feeding him pet store food, but i’m not sure if i should be giving him other things. what do you guys think? should i be giving him treats? since he’s in a tank, there aren’t metal bars for a water bottle, so he’s currently drinking out of a plastic coffee topper. i feel like i could do something better, but i’m not sure what. any suggestions? he also keeps kicking bedding into his water. is there a way to stop that?

i got him some sticks to chew on so his teeth don’t grow into his brain (i think?), but he isn’t chewing on them. what should i do?

**Cage:**

i found a used 10 gallon tank for $10 and bought a lid separately. now that the wheel is in there, he likes to try to climb on top of it, so i’m worried he might escape. it’s also starting to feel cramped in the tank. i would love to get him something bigger, but it’s expensive, and my parents don’t really love him being here. the tank makes them a bit more comfortable compared to a wire cage. any thoughts on this? is the setup okay?

**Handling:**

any advice for handling him? i’m not totally comfortable with it yet, and i don’t think he is either. however, he comes to greet me every time i visit him, and i love just being next to him while he’s in his tank 😭

**Health:**

my mouse was handled very roughly, grabbed by the tail multiple times, and literally thrown into different tanks. so far he looks normal, but i don’t know how long it would take for problems to show. nothing appears wrong right now. do you think i’m in the clear?

**Other Advice:**

have i missed anything? should i be worried about diseases? my family kind of is, so for now he’s staying in the bathroom to make them more comfortable. any advice for a first-time owner?

i truly appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and help. i really love this mouse with all my heart, so i’m sorry for all the questions. lastly, if anyone has name suggestions, please let me know! i was thinking maybe fitzgerald, even though it’s closely associated with an author i don’t know much about. i just thought it sounded cool. thank you!",33,1769546910.0,PetMice,9,0.98,False

The thing is, I don’t want to push my idea too hard because I know she’ll probably insist on the food idea no matter how much we discuss it,why?

1qoq05q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qoq05q,GrimeZ has dropped a very highly controversial mixtape ‘The Minute Before’ (2005),"After the success of his 2004 album ‘1984’ and the European tour that followed. GrimeZ was the most spoken man around England he had the weight of the world in his hands and what better way to use that then to channel it into new music. He was also nominated for a BET Awards but failed to get it.wo Soo throughout 2005 he began working on another mixtape rumoured to be called TRAUMA. 

He was working on this project for about 4 months until everything came to a halt. See GrimeZ’s mother had gone to London for a few days to help his auntie move in to her new flat in Soho. She was set to return on July 7th. GrimeZ was actually meant to preform at Hyde park too on July 2nd but pulled out due to illness. He was replaced with Skeamz. 

On July 7th 2005, GrimeZ woke up at around 8.25 and made him and Hayley some breakfast and coffee and they both sat and started watching some shows on TV. GrimeZ then got a call. It was his mother calling saying how she’s missed the underground train to the station so she was gonna be delayed for a while until the next one. little did they know the world was about to change. Only about 5 minutes later every channel in the UK turned off and on came the news. They weren’t ready for what came next. 

Sadly at 8.50AM on July 7th, it was reported 3 bombs had gone off on the underground passages set off by 3 individuals. London had been hit with a terrorist attack. The nation went silent. And a little under an hour later a fourth bomb went off and blew the front of a double decker bus off. The world fell still. GrimeZ immediately called his mother who was in shock. He made sure she was okay. He then called his sister who was in tears about this. 

After that the nation was never the same, GrimeZ took time off to cope and to help families who suffered from this tragedy. However he also noticed people being silenced for using their voice on the situation. GrimeZ realised and listened to these people and realised that he needed to use his voice for those who can’t. 

Over the next few weeks he scrapped his next mixtape and was working on a mixtape. He names the mixtape ‘The Minute Before’ as in his words ‘The minute before was the final time England was okay. The final time people had a voice. He made it with frustration of the 52 lives lost who was just commuting to work that day who didn’t have choice. He spoke out about how the government was undermining those. if he hadn’t who else would is what he was thinking. 

He was done the mistake was done but Empire Gave him an ultimatum as if he dropped this tape with everything on it he would be out of his contract. GrimeZ response “FUCK YOU” and on August 7th a month after the attacks ‘The Minute Before’ dropped and fans saw what he was saying. On the song Aunt Jolene. He raps about a woman who worked a 9-5 and was on the train for work and bragging about her niece when her life was took because of politics and foreign affairs. He then ended the song with “See Aunt Jolene, would be alive if the world wasn’t fucking evil, a family isn’t enough to live, FUCK”. His frustration was seen on this project. 

He was later dropped from Empire and many other artists such as Kano and even Skeamz called him out on it but GrimeZ was tired of not speaking. The Minute Before sold 25k and was forbidden on the charts but no radio plays and was even banned from certain festivals. 

(Verse from Aunt Jolene)

Aunt Jolene on the platform, 8am stress,

Cheap coffee breath, life heavy on her chest,

Still gassing her niece like “my girl’s the best,”

From the blocks to the stars, didn’t settle for less.

Screech, bang, smoke where’s the safety plan?

Just suits on the news with their shaky hands,

“Couldn’t predict it” yeah right, that line’s dead,

When the warnings got filed and left unread.

They watch man’s postcode, man’s face, man’s tone,

But miss real threats sat close to home,

Spend billions abroad on oil and pride,

Then act all shocked when the violence arrive.

Fuck that you knew, you saw, you stalled,

Red flags screaming but you let ‘em all fall,

Too busy spying on kids in hoods in halls,

Missed real killers moving through the cracks in the walls.

Aunt Jolene weren’t “one of the deceased,”

She was Sunday dinners, jokes, receipts,

Worked all week just to live small dreams,

Now her name’s just ink on a TV screen.

Don’t ring bells, don’t hold no minute,

Talking with you about comic books, about nothing and everything, about stupid jokes you somehow always understood kept me alive during a time when I didn’t think I wanted to be. You have no idea how much that mattered.

When we first started talking, I was in a really bad place. My brother had just left our family, and when he did, he said things that cut deeper than I ever admit out loud. He was like a father to me, so losing him felt like losing my dad all over again. I was drowning in that grief and anger and loneliness.

And then, on that same day, I accidentally sent you a dumb Invincible video some ridiculous Omni-Man bees edit. It was a mistake. I didn’t expect anything to come of it. But we started talking, and suddenly I didn’t feel so alone anymore.

Basically, I work at a coffee shop and it is very loud. Because of that, I wear loop earplugs everyday. It’s been traditional in my job to just watch things on your phone at low volume when it’s slow. Recently, my new coworker (who I work 3 days a week with) says he doesn’t want anything playing out loud from my phone, but he also isn’t talkative. The complete silence minus my own breathing, him turning the pages of his book etc. is driving me absolutely bonkers. I have adhd and autism so the complete silence is simultaneously overstimulating me while still leaving me understimulated. I need SOME kind of background noise otherwise I get way too aware of all the little noises which are so very grating to me. 

I do have AirPods, but I wouldn’t be able to hear customers on noise cancelling and the noise transparency mode leaves me very overstimulated because it doesn’t effectively dull the noise of the bean grinder and milk steaming wand. 

Because of all of this, I’ve been looking at shokz earbuds and am curious what people’s experiences are. If you used them with earplugs, how was that? Do you prefer the over the ear ones or the ones that wrap around your neck? Is the sound quality okay?

1. **Actually visit first** Not a quick vacation. Spend a real week or two here if you can. Sit in traffic. Walk neighborhoods. Pay attention to how the city feels on a random Tuesday. LA is great.... but it’s not for everyone and that’s totally okay.
2. **Get real about money** LA can be sneaky expensive. Housing is just the beginning. Gas, food, parking, taxes, and doing anything social adds up fast. Make sure the life you want here matches what you can comfortably afford.
3. **Research neighborhoods like it’s a job** Where you live matters more than almost anything else here. Commute, safety, noise, walkability, and vibe all vary block by block. There are several discussions on which neighborhoods are good. What works for someone may not work for you. Research! 
4. **Think about your actual lifestyle** What will you do on a normal day? Beaches, hikes, food, gyms, coffee, shopping, nightlife. Living close to the things you’ll actually use makes a huge difference in how much you enjoy LA.
5. **Tell everyone you’re moving** You’ll be surprised how many people have advice, warnings, connections, or friends out here. Some of the best tips come from random conversations.

If you’ve already moved to LA, what’s one thing you wish someone told you before you did?",8,1769546452.0,MovingToLosAngeles,1,0.91,False

* **Starbucks decided on this after reviewing threats and risks to Niccol's safety, a spokesperson said.**
* **His annual travel budget cap of $250,000 has also been removed.**

Starbucks is getting CEO [Brian Niccol](https://www.businessinsider.com/brian-niccol-starbucks-ceo-one-year-road-map-report-card-2025-9) to use the company jet for all his travels — and removing his quarter-million travel budget cap.

In a Monday filing, the Seattle-based coffee chain said that it was changing its agreement on how much Niccol could use the company's private jet for his personal travel. And the main reason for this change is to ensure Niccol's safety.

**Before September, Niccol's use of the Starbucks plane for non-work reasons was subject to an annual cap of $250,000, and if he exceeded that amount, he had to reimburse the company, the Monday filing wrote.**

But after September, the board removed the $250,000 annual cap and replaced it with a ""more frequent quarterly review of Mr. Niccol's personal flights by the chair of the Compensation Committee,"" per the filing. Starbucks has not imposed a new maximum spending limit.

""This change was driven by the security study's recommendation that Mr. Niccol use Company aircraft for all air travel, including personal travel, and the Company's ongoing monitoring of Mr. Niccol's security situation,"" the filing wrote.

A Starbucks spokesperson said the company's board recently decided to enhance security measures for Niccol, following a review of threats and risks to the chief executive.

**Following the review, the board has made it a requirement to use private aircraft for all his travels, the spokesperson added.**

Last year, Starbucks was hiring for [a pilot](https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-hiring-pilot-company-jet-salary-up-to-360-000-2025-5) to fly its private Gulfstream jets. In the job listing, the company said it would pay the pilot a salary between $207,000 and $360,300.

The filing also wrote that Niccol was paid about $31 million in compensation in 2025, a drop from the $95.8 million he was paid in 2024. His 2024 compensation was boosted by $90.2 million in stock awards he received as part of his signing contract.

Niccol started at the company in September 2024, moving over from Chipotle. He has helmed the chain's ""[Back to Starbucks](https://www.businessinsider.com/brian-niccol-reddit-back-to-starbucks-working-2025-12)"" turnaround plan, an effort to turn around several quarters of poor results because of a declining customer experience.

My parents are the typical very ""uninvolved knownothing about their kids"" parents, especially dad. When I was 11 they took us to for a trip to Mexico. On the plane ride my dad fed me milano cookies that had chopped up pecans in it. I was suffering pretty bad, but instead of being taken to the hospital they took me to the resort and had me go in the pool. 

You'd think they would be better about this after the trip but they still stocked the house with nuts. The kicker to me is that my brother is allergic too.

More recently during covid my dad made thanksgiving dinner. Everyone kinda hates him because he is a fuck ass man for multiple reasons and because it was lockdown it was only him and me. 

For mashed potatoes instead of milk he used, hazelnut coffee creamer. Who does this? When I point out my allergies he tells me ""I don't remember but it's artificial flavoring anyways, no nuts.""

WHAT IS THE ARTIFICIAL FLAVORING MADE OF?!

I somewhat understand being an inconsiderate pos but it feels so comically incompetent to be this dumb. 

Livelong abuse is one thing but livelong surreal abuse is another...

1qophhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qophhf/the_floor_is_sticky/,The Floor is Sticky.,"We moved into the flat above the butcher's two months ago. It was a step down from our old place; John lost his good job and we had to make adjustments.

The place wasn't exactly the Ritz, but it functioned. The wallpaper popped and flaked when you scraped a nail along it, and peeled away at the corner behind the TV. The bathroom taps sputtered feebly as I stood shivering on December mornings, waiting to wash my face. I battled the condensation that hung on the inside of our bedroom window, dreading the mould that would follow.

John and I didn't speak of our diminished circumstances. He'd taken a job at a distribution warehouse, and they were working him like a dog. He was too stressed, too focused on working every hour God sent, and I was too afraid of breaking the relative peace.

I spent my days holed up in the small flat watching daytime TV, skin crawling at the accumulating dust.

The case officer's voice echoed in my head:

\*Can you bend over to pick up a pen from the floor? Can you do it now so I can see?\*

Shame prickled up my neck. I pushed myself up slowly from the sofa, catching myself on the coffee table as I rose.

I walked into the kitchen to get away from the thoughts, grimacing at the sickly smell leaching up from the butcher's below. Coffee would help.

I flicked the kettle on and leaned back against the counter, shins burning.

It hadn't always been like this. My mind reeled backwards before I could stop it. Back to when we could still pay the mortgage on our three-bed semi. Back when my body still worked, and John could still look me in the face.

A tear burned my eye, and I wiped it away angrily. The wet blur caught a glimmer of light; something shone up at me from the floor. I knelt, knees cracking. It was a clear, viscous film. I touched it hesitantly. Thin, mucosal strands stretched between my fingers. It smelled strongly of petrol.

I wiped my hand on my trousers, confused, and grabbed the damp cloth that lay on the scratched worktop. I wiped away the unknown residue and threw the rag into the sink.

I returned to the sofa and turned the TV up, trying to push the pain out of focus. Bailiffs were executing a writ of possession on an irate shopkeeper. I watched as he attempted to lock the shutters and trap them inside. My mind flitted back to the probing questions of the case officer:

\*If you spilled something...Could you kneel?...Can you clean up after yourself?... Show me.\*

The bailiff called the police. The shopkeeper spat and swore. The shutters rattled closed. I'd worked my whole adult life. I'd always paid my taxes, never claimed anything. And here I was, begging and cringing for my pittance.

I heard heavy footsteps climbing the metal stairs outside. John was home. He brought an eddy of cold wind inside with him and shut the door without saying anything. I pressed my tongue to the back of my teeth.

""Hey, babe."" I called to the hallway. I got no response. I heard the heavy thud of one boot pulled off, then the other. The footsteps receded into the bathroom.

I turned my eyes back to the TV, chest heavy. The shopkeeper was calling his cousin to come and beat up the bailiff. His vicious words were censored out with a long, shrill bleep.

\*\*\*\*

John and I sat on the sofa, microwave meals on our laps. I twisted a fork through the yellow slop that was supposed to be carbonara, eyeing the pink flecks of meat.

John sighed. I looked over at him, longing to touch him.

""How was your day?""

He shrugged. ""Same as always.""

He didn't look at me, and I didn't press him. Fatigue was etched onto his face. I looked at the grey hunk of lasagne on his tray. A rainbow of oil glinted at me from the edge of the plate. My brow furrowed as I watched him lift his fork. A thin tendril clung to it and stretched upwards towards his mouth.

""John?""

He looked back at me, irritated. ""What?""

""Nothing."" I didn't want to bother him. The food was barely edible anyway, I didn't need to put him off.

He looked back at the TV and we sat in silence. The shopkeeper spat venom at the police officer, and was shoved head first into the car.

\*\*\*\*

I took a deep breath and stood up from my stool by the kitchen sink. I plunged my hands back into the tepid dishwater and resumed washing. I lifted out a plate, disturbing a prism of colour on the water's surface.

I stopped, watching the colours ripple as the water settled. I looked at the plate again; smeared across it was the same oily film. I scrunched my nose at the petrol smell.

I turned on the tap, trying to rinse it away, but it clung there insistently.

I scrubbed. The pain in my wrists flared. When I finally set the clean plate on the rack, my fingers felt tacky, as though I’d dipped them in glue. I squirted 4 pumps from the soap dispenser and rubbed my hands together frantically in the hot water until they turned red.

\*\*\*\*

The next morning, I sat in my usual place on the sofa, watching passively as a toothless woman screamed obscenities at her philandering husband. The host gleefully sat between them on the stage, scorning the man for his disloyalty. A huge security guard held the man's jacket as he grew red in the face, desperately trying to throw a punch at the presenter.

My mind kept going back to the kitchen, agitating over the stain. \*Had I gotten all of it? What even was it? A chemical? Something soaking up from the butcher's?\* I switched off the TV just as the woman's sister bypassed the security guard and launched herself at the man, scratching his face.

My ears rang in the silence.

\*Could you mop the floor on a bad day?\*

I stood up and walked into the kitchen, bare feet careful on the cold tiles.

\*\*\*\*

It was back.

The puddle sat in the same place as before, just to the left of our rickety table. The light from the window caught it and reflected back a familiar oily rainbow. It didn't move, or change, it just waited. The smell of gasoline hit me again, but this time something lay underneath, sweeter, cloying. Animal.

\*\*\*\*

I hovered awkwardly in front of the butcher's counter, waiting for him to appear from behind the metal curtain. I shifted my weight from side to side to ease the ache in my shins.The smell was stronger down here, and I tucked my chin down into my hood to escape it. I had only met the butcher twice, and I would rather have kept it that way. He was fat and balding, but carried himself with unearned confidence. His lecherous smirks put me on edge; I had tried my best to avoid him, until now.

A fly buzzed around a hanging slab of meat, and I watched it with revolted fascination. The curtain jangled. I looked round to see the butcher stride into view.

""Well, hello again beautiful. I was wondering when you'd come and say hello. Did you miss me?""

""Um... no, I needed to ask you about something.""

""You didn't miss me? You're breaking my heart love. Why don't you give me a smile eh?""

""Look, I think some of your chemicals are soaking through into our flat. I keep finding this... stain in the kitchen.""

""You going to invite me in eh? We could have some fun you know. I won't tell that bloke of yours.""

""For Christ's sake, listen to me!"" I shouted. ""Whatever you're using down here, it's leaching upstairs. I need you to check if there's a... hole or a... a crack or something that's letting it through.""

His face grew cold. The empty stupidity behind his eyes vanished and was replaced with rage. I saw then that he was not just a pest but a dangerous man. I stepped backwards.

""There's no need to be rude. Fucking bitch. I'd be doing you a favour you know. Fat bitch like you.""

""I'm sorry, I uh...""

He leaned closer. An animal stink rose off his body. Sweat, and blood.

""You come down 'ere, accusing me, and now you're sorry?""

""Please... I'm not accusing you. I'm just worried about the chemicals-""

""What chemicals? I don't use no chemicals. You think I can't run my own shop?""

""No...no. I just thought maybe... something in the pipes...""

""You're a mental bitch, aren't you?""

I cringed, backing away. He slammed his hand down on the counter. I flinched and recoiled. I turned on my heels and ran back up the stairs.

""Fuck off then you stupid slut! Tell your bloke I said hello!"" He shouted after me, barking laughter.

\*\*\*\*

My teeth ground against each other as I worked, sweat dripping from my forehead onto the soapy tiles. The hard bristles scraped forward, dragged back, as my shoulders burned with the effort.

The stain seemed thicker now, more resistant. The brush kept catching against the floor, the oily residue gathering behind it. I fought against it bitterly, scalding my hands in the rinsewater. The smell of bleach and gasoline made my head swim, until finally the floor was clean. I leaned back on the counter, breathless and exhausted.

I heard the familiar heavy boots pounding up the stairs. I looked around guiltily. John appeared in the door frame and looked down at me, irritation on his face.

""What the fuck are you doing?""

""I uh, I was just cleaning the floor. There was a...stain that has been bothering me.""

""You're going to make yourself ill. I can't take time off to look after you.""

""I know, I know, I'll be fine. I just... had a bit more energy today.""

""You know what the doctor said. The last thing I need is you going downhill again.""

""I'm sorry, John."" My hands shook as I looked away from his disappointed face.

He sighed angrily and stomped away. His footsteps disappeared into the bedroom, and the door slammed.

I sat there, sweaty and ashamed, and looked back at the floor. It gleamed innocently as I stood up and turned off the light, shutting the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*

I was seated at a table, endless darkness surrounding me. In front of me lay a vast chessboard. My opponent sat opposite, clipboard obscuring their face. I couldn't remember sitting down, couldn't remember the game starting. I looked at my pieces; I had lost all but 3.

""What's happening?"" I asked, confused.

""Are you able to wash independently?"" A deep, flat voice asked.

""Wh...what? Yes... I can wash...""

My pawn moved forward. A black knight claimed it.

""Are you depressed?"" My bishop slid diagonally. A castle knocked it off the board.

""I'm not depressed, I just.... I'm just unwell. I can't...""

""Are you a burden to your friends and family? Is there anyone left, you stupid slut?""

Checkmate.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke with a jolt, cold sweat on my face. I gasped for breath as the room swam back into focus. I breathed a deep, shuddering sigh. I lay there for a moment, trying to calm my racing heart. I decided a cup of tea would be the best thing. I threw back the covers and went to sit up... and couldn't. Panic rose again through my body as I looked around wildly. I strained hard and pulled my leg up from the mattress. A long, thick tendril stretched away from it like toffee. I screamed.

\*\*\*\*

I awoke with a start as a bus went rattling by the window, and turned over to see John looking back at me, smiling softly.

""Morning, babe. How are you feeling?""

I scanned my body; my shoulders throbbed horribly. I tried to recall the nightmare, but it slipped away from me like sand clenched in a fist. My mind snapped back to my pain; I would pay today for my efforts.

""I'm fine. Long shift today?""

""I should be home around 6."" He leaned closer, worry in his eyes, and gently kissed my lips. ""Get some rest today, don't push yourself again. I'll bring home dinner.""

""I promise."" I said, smiling back at him. My fingers curled under the sheet.

\*\*\*\*

The door shut behind John, and I lay there in the silence, my promise hanging in the air. I stared at the ceiling for a long time, focusing on a cobweb in the corner. A spider spun its prey endlessly around and around between its legs.

I pushed up from the bed with a grunt. John had left me a coffee on the bedside table, and I drank it gratefully, savouring the warmth that spread through my aching chest. I shuffled into the living room and flicked on the TV, volume low.

A crime scene cleanup show was on; a grim intervention with masked men in hazmat suits. I sipped my coffee as they worked through a filthy, cluttered kitchen, shovelling heaps of mouldy paper and rotting food into black bags.

In the centre of the floor lay a deep, purple stain, blooming wide on the filthy linoleum. The edges looked iridescent under the light of the camera, like petrol on wet tarmac.

One of the men took a utility knife and began to slice open the linoleum, pulling back strips of sodden underlay and revealing the rotting floorboards underneath. As he pressed down to lever a section free, his gloved hand stuck. I watched as he tugged, and a long, viscous strand stretched between the glove and the floor. He yanked upwards and it snapped with a wet smack.

My stomach lurched. I fumbled the remote and the TV clicked off. My pale face stared back from the black screen, eyes wide.

\*Do you find yourself fixating on small things more than you used to, like household messes for example?\*

I had to go and see.

\*\*\*\*

I waited in the hallway, breath shallow in my chest. I willed myself to turn the handle, scolded myself for being so childish. Of course there would be nothing there, the floor was immaculate. I was just stressed, just imagining things. My hand shook as I turned the handle.

\*\*\*\*

I stood in the doorway as unreality washed over me.

The kitchen was unrecognisable. The substance had spread almost wall to wall. Writhing tendrils were climbing up the table legs and counters. Smaller patches had seeded on the walls and the fridge. The smell burned my eyes; the heady petrol had mixed with the stench of rotting meat, amplified to a choking crescendo. My knees buckled. I grabbed the door frame, desperately trying to hold myself up.

I watched as a twisting arm snaked up the fridge, slithering up to the handle and nudging the door ajar. The cold white light shone on the remains of a roast chicken, slowly liquefying under a blanket of sludge. Nausea came over me in waves. A bubble grew and popped, hissing.

The once clear film had turned a deep, bruised purple, and thin rivulets were sprawling outwards like veins. I clapped a hand over my mouth. A tendril that had been creeping unseen towards my feet reared back at the sound. I slammed the door.

\*\*\*\*

""John, please, I need you. Please, just come home.""

""Can't you just tell me what's wrong? I really can't leave, they'll take away my overtime. We'll be fucked.""

""Please John, I wouldn't ask if it wasn't an emergency. Please just come home.""

He sighed angrily. ""Fuck's sake. OK, I'll be there in 20.""

I hung up the phone and paced back and forth on the balcony, fighting down the hysterics. I tried desperately to cling onto rationality. To make sense of this. But there was no understanding it. I sat on the bottom step, curling my arms around myself, and stared hard at the ground.

John arrived 10 minutes later, and shoved open the gate with irritation. His face broke as he caught sight of me, and he rushed to my side.

""Babe? What's wrong? What's happened?""

""John... I... I can't...""

""It's OK,"" he said soothingly. ""Just tell me what's going on.""

""The kitchen... the floor...""

""What is it?""

I just looked at him weakly. I couldn't say it. I gestured back towards the door.

""Stay here.""

Heavy boots thudded up the stairs behind me. I waited for the scream. Nothing came.

""John?"" I looked round. I couldn't see him.

Panic shot through me. \*It must have swallowed him. I sent him in there with no warning and it got him.\*

I raced up the stairs and flung open the kitchen door, and saw John, standing in the centre of the room looking confused. The substance lay underneath his feet, flat and yielding.

""Babe? There's nothing here."" He said, using the same quiet voice he used when I had my flare-ups.

I stared at him. At the stinking purple mess pulsing beneath his feet. At the sprawling veins still climbing the walls, now reaching the ceiling. ""John... it's everywhere.""

He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""Maybe you should lie down. I'll get you some water.""

""John, please-"" I took one step towards him, and a writhing tendril wrapped quickly around my ankle. It burned, searing pain shooting up my leg. I gasped and fell forward, landing on my knees directly onto the substance.

It gave like thick gravy. More vines shot upwards, twisting around my wrists and ripping them downwards. I gasped in horror and pain. A deep, wet sucking sound rose from below. It pulled me down. The stench was maddening. I stared at John for help, but he just stood there, brow furrowed, looking at me.

""I'll call the GP in the morning. You're obviously hallucinating. The stress, the pain, it's all too much.""

""John!"" I screamed helplessly as the hungry liquid compressed my abdomen, lurching upwards. The burning agony made it impossible to think. It squeezed the air from my lungs. I went limp, giving in.

John was already turning away. ""I'll speak to my boss. I've got some holiday saved... it will be OK... I'll try and get home early tonight.""

The last thing I heard was the front door clicking and John's heavy boots on the stairs.

A couple weeks ago, I asked about mirror affirmations and was blown away by all the experiences you shared: from feeling awkward at first to having really transformative moments. It made me realize one thing: **consistency is the hardest part**.

Even if you know mirror affirmations work, it’s easy to skip days, forget your practice, or lose motivation. I’ve been experimenting with ways to make it easier to stick to daily practice, and here’s what I’ve learned:

**Tips for staying consistent:**

* Set a specific time each day and tie it to a routine (morning coffee, brushing teeth, etc.)
* Keep affirmations short, positive, and easy to say
* Track your streaks to see your progress over time
* Use reminders so you don’t forget
* Reflect briefly afterward: how did saying them make you feel today?

For anyone looking for a structured way to practice daily, I built an iOS app called **Dear Mirror**. It helps you:

* Get daily curated affirmations
* Choose categories like confidence, self-love, success, abundance, health, relationships
* Create your own affirmations
* Track your streaks and set reminders

I built it mainly for myself and friends to stay consistent, and I’m using it to **affirm for my first 1,000 users**. If you’re curious, **DM me and I’ll share launch access**. What helps you stay consistent with your own mirror affirmations?",1,1769545345.0,Manifestation,0,1.0,False

I'm newly diagnosed as well (Oct.) and am obese. Since Oct I've lost 54 lbs and taking control of my situation.    
I promise educating yourself goes a LONG ways.   
Learn about what is low on the glycemic index and make sure to always pair anything sugar (even fruit) with protein, fat, fiber etc.   Its amazing how much of a difference it makes.

Also... move your body.  Even if its just walking.  When I first started I barely got 10-15 minute walks in and was struggling.  Not going to lie, its hard at first.  My entire body hurt, my feet hurt, I'd get chub rub etc.  BUT I PROMISE IT IS ALL WORTH IT!!   
The biggest thing for me and I think this is relevant to a lot of people is cutting all all the crap drinks. I only drink water. I don't even do diet sodas only because its a trigger and makes me want more so I avoid anything that isn't water.   No crazy calorie, sugar coffee drinks/energy drinks/soda/juices etc.  Also, I do not eat at fast food restaurants.  The seldom times I've gone out to dinner its always Chicken salad, extra chicken. 

My advice as someone who has been able to look a good amount of weight since being diagnosed is cut out fast food, cut out all crap drinks and just get to walking. 

This community here has been nothing short of amazing for me.  I come here often just to read others comments and posts. The support is amazing.   
If you are feeling overwhelmed you are not alone and you have plenty of support here.

Been out of work for almost a year now, and couldn’t get a single interview invitation until the end of 2025.



Of the interviews I’ve had, I keep having to deal with these ridiculous “hiring managers” who have barely any experience (way, way less than mine), panel interviews where I’m asked the same question 4 different ways, inexperienced teams who can’t answer a single question I ask them, etc.



I just had a panel interview for a role where I matched all the requirements and have years of experience in what they’re looking for. Had a screening call and then the interview with the hiring manager in mid-December. They made me wait a month before I could have the panel interview. Panel interview went perfectly fine, I answered all their questions confidently, with examples to outline my approach to things, matched their energy, and the whole time I kept getting responses of “that’s a very impressive answer!”, “wow thank you, that was a great answer!”, and so forth. Even in my first interview with the HM, he kept saying how impressive my background was. I’m aware that responses like that can be indicative of them just blowing smoke up a candidate’s ass for appearances, in which case, they’re just being overly fake and positive to an unnecessary degree when they really couldn’t care less.



Got the generic rejection email this morning from them, with no feedback or anything. I just have no idea what the fuck is going on. I know I’ll sound biased, but I really do feel like I’m crushing these interviews. I don’t get nervous, and my memory is a steel trap, so I’m able to pull up very detailed information for my answers in the moment while keeping my answers on track and concise so I’m not rambling. I do extensive research on the company, create a portfolio of resources that get great responses, show them that I can grasp what they do and what their immediate needs are, etc. I pepper in a good amount of personability to break the ice, match the vibe they’re giving, and I have enough knowledge where I don’t sound robotic in my answers because I don’t have a need to overly prepare. I can rip through STAR method questions and answers with ease because I have a lot of experience in the types of scenarios that STAR method questions revolve around.



Nothing is fucking working. I can’t even get the everyday jobs like the local coffee shop, retail, grocery store, etc., because these places are most likely looking at my resume and thinking, “What in the fuck is this person doing trying to work here? I’m not gonna hire them, they’ll just leave as soon as something better comes along.” 



I never thought I’d find myself living like this, in this endless cycle of rejection by people who don’t have my credentials and experience telling me I’m the one who’s not good enough. I’m not sure I belong on this planet anymore. I’ve never felt so worthless.

1qop93c,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1qop93c/ok_fuck_it_no_more_nts_in_my_life/,"Ok, fuck it, no more NT's in my life.","I'm so goddamn TIRED of this guy and I don't want to see him AGAIN, him or any neurotypical person.

Yesterday I made a post about how a friend of my friend apologized after saying obscene things about me and my body when I rejected him!(I made a post on that too), we went to a coffee shop and made peace, he asked if we could be friends and I said ""yes"" because I wanted to be cordial.

Buuuuuuuuut! He unblocked me, told me sexual things (again but in a lustful way) and sent me pictures of his... you know what I'm talking about, so I FINALLY told him to fuck off and blocked him.

IDK how this guy obtained so many girlfriends but I DON'T want to be one of them, I NEVER wanted something with this guy and I'm tired of being nice and cordial with him, just to be mistreated again.

What's the point in interacting with neurotypicals? I'm not the only one who had this experience, a lot of people in this sub complained about the same things, being discriminated against, bullied, harassed, etc, why are we trying to seek the validation and approbation of these people?

I had to work in therapy on my trust issues with neurotypicals because I was almost SA'ed in a classmate's house and that got me a lot of self esteem and trust problems, for what? Just for suffering the same shitty scenario again?

Man fuck this shit, I had a lot of people tell me in my past posts that ""I was being arbitrary"", ""I should give neurotypicals a chance"" and blah blah blah, and now? I'm just another autistic person complaining about NT's in an autism sub, among the hundred posts of the same thing.

You know what's the worst thing? My friend tried to hook me up with this guy, that's right, I told her that I wasn't seeking NT's to date and she did this anyway, while KNOWING that he has these types of outburst.

1qop8wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/swoletariat/comments/1qop8wo/nonshitty_place_to_buy_protein_powder/,non-shitty place to buy protein powder?,"i usually just buy the generic drugstore chain brand where i get my prescriptions but i figure i might as well ask to see if there's anywhere worth putting my money towards. i know there's no such thing as ethical consumption, etc etc, but i figure i can try to hand cash to people who aren't dogshit chuds since gym culture is rife with those. if i can dare to dream, maybe there's some POC or lgtbq+ owned fitness brand or retailer with somewhat progressive views. but i'll settle for ""this company is shitty but they better than black rifle coffee"" are there any online stores or brands for protein that fit this description?

for comparison, the generic brand i buy isn't too bad. it's 26mg protein per serving at $27\~ per jug, i get about 24 shakes out of it so i guess we're looking at 85¢ per serving of 26g of protein. i have some wiggle room in my budget so let's say my ceiling is $40 per jug
