1psy8lf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIreland/comments/1psy8lf/decided_to_start_travelling_with_my_mother_and/,"Decided to start travelling with my mother and younger brother. Any recommendations for both an anxious, high-strung, perimenopausal woman and a high functioning autistic child with no sense of urgency?","
Before anyone asks YES I LOVE MY MUM AND LITTLE BROTHER. But I’m also deep rooted in reality and know they are both amazing people and absolute pains in my arsehole. 

My mum is genuinely formed of muscle, bones, and stress. I know she needs a relatively straightforward city/town to visit. High population/traffic areas are ok as long as the actual streets and roads are somewhat easy to navigate? If that makes sense. Good food and coffee calms her down. Language is no problem because I am at her disposal and my complete lack of social anxiety can make anything she needs happen. She’s not too keen on stuffy museums. But she’s a massive walk-n-talker so if that helps narrow it down then fucking fantastic. 

My little brother is 12 and autistic. He has like level 1/2 autism? Idk how far the spectrum goes but if ground floor is neurotypical then he’s around level 1 or 2. Exceptionally intelligent. Lacks almost every form of common sense. So ideally a place where I can safely let him get lost and not murdered or kidnapped if he chooses to wander. He loves chess, rubix cubes, Roblox, and piano. He really likes eating salmon too. And he’s not half bad at chopping vegetables and helping me cook whenever he sleeps over. 

I’m a 25F year old hermit. Ex junkie. My brother and I love anime. I genuinely just stay at home, trade, read, and go to the gym. Every 6-8 weeks I’ll invite one of my 5 friends for dinner and 8 hours of non stop talking before they leave at around 23:00. I’m fascinated by and love to get to know people of different cultures and I’d like to visit a country where I can talk to random strangers without them thinking I’m an absolute menace to society. And obviously take pictures I can look back on at 3 in the morning when I can’t sleep. Idk if this helps in any way but sometimes I read gay fanfiction. (Currently on my 7th reread of He Chose Titans on Ao3) 

I have no idea where to even start looking. It’s my first time actually being alive after wasting so many years on drugs. Now I’ve a really good relationship with my mum and little brother and I’d like to visit the world with them. Starting with the EU as we live in Ireland. We are originally from Eastern Europe if that also helps.

1psy779,https://www.reddit.com/r/havintha/comments/1psy779/how_to_get_glowing_skin_without_using_harsh/,How to Get Glowing Skin Without Using Harsh Chemicals,"Here's the thing about glowing skin—it doesn't need to be complicated. You don't need a ten-step routine with ingredients you can't pronounce, and you definitely don't need to stress about whether what you're putting on your face is doing more harm than good. The truth is, some of the most beautiful, radiant skin comes from keeping things simple, natural, and consistent. If you've been dealing with irritation, surprise breakouts, or that tight, uncomfortable dryness from chemical-loaded products, going natural might be exactly what your skin has been asking for.

**Start with gentle cleansing**  

Think about how your skin feels after using those foaming cleansers that promise a ""deep clean."" Tight? Squeaky? Maybe even a little angry? That's because a lot of chemical cleansers are way too aggressive—they strip away everything, including the natural oils your skin actually needs to stay healthy and balanced.

Instead, try switching to something milder and more natural. Herbal powders, plant-based face washes, or gentle natural cleansers get the job done without leaving your skin feeling like it just survived a battle. They remove the day's dirt and excess oil while respecting your skin's natural protective barrier. Your face will feel clean, not stripped.

**Exfoliate, but be kind about it**  

Yes, exfoliation is important—it helps clear away dead skin cells that make you look dull and tired. But here's where people often go wrong: they scrub too hard or use harsh chemical exfoliants that end up causing tiny damage and inflammation you can't even see.

Natural exfoliators like coffee grounds, oatmeal, or good old multani mitti work beautifully to slough off dead skin while boosting circulation. And the best part? They do it gently. When you remove that layer of dead cells without being rough about it, your skin's natural glow has room to shine through. You'll notice the difference—it just looks fresher and more awake.

**Hydration is everything**  

Let's talk about hydration, because this is where the magic really happens. Those chemical products that promise instant brightness? They're usually just sitting on top of your skin, creating an illusion. Real, lasting glow comes from skin that's genuinely hydrated—both from the inside and outside.

Start with the obvious: drink water. Enough of it. Throughout the day. It sounds almost too simple, but staying hydrated helps your body flush out toxins and keeps your skin looking plump and healthy from within.

On the outside, natural moisturizers are your friends. Aloe vera, glycerin-based products, or light plant oils help seal in moisture without making your pores feel suffocated. Your skin gets what it needs without the heavy, greasy feeling or the worry about pore-clogging chemicals.

**Protect yourself from the sun**  

We all know sun damage is a problem, but let's be real—avoiding the sun completely isn't exactly practical. What you can do, though, is be smart about protection. Sunscreen is non-negotiable. Covering up when possible and staying out of direct sunlight during those brutal midday hours goes a long way in preventing tanning, dark spots, and that premature aging nobody wants.

And when you do get some sun exposure, soothe your skin afterward with cooling natural ingredients. Aloe vera or cucumber aren't just spa clichés—they genuinely help calm and repair sun-stressed skin.

**Natural face packs are worth your time**  

Once or twice a week, treat yourself to a natural face mask. It's not indulgent—it's maintenance. Multani mitti works wonders for detoxifying and cooling hot, tired skin. Curd gently exfoliates while adding nourishment. Rose water refreshes and tones everything back into balance.

These simple masks help keep your skin clear and even-toned without subjecting it to chemical stress. Plus, there's something really satisfying about knowing exactly what you're putting on your face.

**What you eat shows on your face**  

This might not be what you want to hear, but your skin is basically a mirror for what's happening inside your body. Fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds aren't just good for you in some abstract way—they provide the vitamins and antioxidants that literally show up on your face.

On the flip side, poor sleep, constant stress, and a diet heavy on processed junk? That shows up too. Dullness, dark circles, random breakouts—they're often your body waving a flag saying something needs to change. Getting decent sleep, moving your body regularly, and being a bit more mindful about what you eat all contribute to that natural glow everyone wants.

**Patience over quick fixes**  

Here's the honest truth: natural skincare won't transform your face overnight. It's not going to promise you miracle results by tomorrow morning. But you know what? That's actually a good thing. What it does offer is something much better—safe, sustainable results that stick around for the long haul.

When you give your skin the time and space to heal and balance itself naturally, the glow you get looks real. It doesn't wash off at the end of the day. It's genuinely yours.

**The bottom line**  

Getting glowing skin without harsh chemicals isn't just possible—it's actually pretty straightforward. Choose gentle products. Use natural ingredients. Build healthy habits. Be consistent. That's really it.

True glow isn't about covering up every tiny flaw or creating some filtered version of yourself. It's about nurturing your skin with patience, simplicity, and the kind of care that nature's been providing all along. Give your skin what it actually needs instead of what marketing tells you it wants, and watch what happens. The results might take a little longer, but they're worth the wait.

1psy6x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TravelNoPics/comments/1psy6x8/decided_to_start_travelling_with_my_mother_and/,"Decided to start travelling with my mother and younger brother. Any recs in the EU for both an anxious, high strung, peri menopausal woman and a high functioning autistic child with no sense of urgency?","
Before anyone asks YES I LOVE MY MUM AND LITTLE BROTHER. But I’m also deep rooted in reality and know they are both amazing people and absolute pains in my arsehole. 

My mum is genuinely formed of muscle, bones, and stress. I know she needs a relatively straightforward city/town to visit. High population/traffic areas are ok as long as the actual streets and roads are somewhat easy to navigate? If that makes sense. Good food and coffee calms her down. Language is no problem because I am at her disposal and my complete lack of social anxiety can make anything she needs happen. She’s not too keen on stuffy museums. But she’s a massive walk-n-talker so if that helps narrow it down then fucking fantastic. 

My little brother is 12 and autistic. He has like level 1/2 autism? Idk how far the spectrum goes but if ground floor is neurotypical then he’s around level 1 or 2. Exceptionally intelligent. Lacks almost every form of common sense. So ideally a place where I can safely let him get lost and not murdered or kidnapped if he chooses to wander. He loves chess, rubix cubes, Roblox, and piano. He really likes eating salmon too. And he’s not half bad at chopping vegetables and helping me cook whenever he sleeps over. 

I’m a 25F year old hermit. Ex junkie. My brother and I love anime. I genuinely just stay at home, trade, read, and go to the gym. Every 6-8 weeks I’ll invite one of my 5 friends for dinner and 8 hours of non stop talking before they leave at around 23:00. I’m fascinated by and love to get to know people of different cultures and I’d like to visit a country where I can talk to random strangers without them thinking I’m an absolute menace to society. And obviously take pictures I can look back on at 3 in the morning when I can’t sleep. Idk if this helps in any way but sometimes I read gay fanfiction. (Currently on my 7th reread of He Chose Titans on Ao3) 

I have no idea where to even start looking. It’s my first time actually being alive after wasting so many years on drugs. Now I’ve a really good relationship with my mum and little brother and I’d like to visit the world with them. Starting with the EU as we live in Ireland. We are originally from Eastern Europe if that also helps.

I want to date again but take things slow. A friend has mentioned I might have avoidant tendencies, so I’m trying to be self-aware and not end things too quickly.

I matched with a guy (M26) on Hinge while I was traveling for 3 weeks. We chatted daily, but he texted a lot and kept messaging even when I wasn’t replying. I told him I want a serious relationship but slowly, and that I’d only know if we were compatible once we met in person.

When I got back, he wanted to pick me up from the airport. I said no, but he pushed to see me that day. I invited him over for coffee since I was tired (I have a male flatmate). He was sweet, brought chocolate, and didn’t push physically. We went on a couple more dates that week, including another night at my place watching a movie. There was no sex, it felt very intimate very fast, like we skipped the “going out and getting to know each other” phase.

The following week I was overwhelmed as any week after almost a month out of the office. Besides that it's Christmas this week, so we had some Christmas related events, like stupid company dinner. Also I getting my exercise routine back. I lift and run and I need it for my mental health, so I didn’t plan to see him because I simply didn't have any free days. I could see that it was bothering him, like he was waiting for any of my plans to fall down. 

On Friday, I was near his place but had yoga and dinner planned with a friend. He tried to change my plans and commented that maybe I didn't need yoga as I had gone to the gym already that week. I kinda ignored the comment and suggested to see each other Saturday but didn’t make concret plans.

On Saturday, I sent him a good morning message around 8am. I went to the gym, had lunch with a friend, then got caught in the rain and went home soaking wet and exhausted. When I checked my phone around 4pm, he had sent multiple messages saying he was waiting for me and implying I was always too busy. Btw... he woke up at 12pm.

I told him we hadn’t made concrete plans and that I felt pressured by all those messages. He sent many messages and called several times. I asked to talk the next day, because at that point all I wanted was a tea, a blanket and a movie, but he kept texting. The next morning I told him I needed to slow things down and that I couldn’t give him more right now. He liked the message but didn’t reply. That night he texted ""good night"" then followed up with more messages and called me five times while I was asleep.

I like him and think he’s kind, but the constant messaging, pressure, and difficulty respecting boundaries feel overwhelming. I’m unsure if this is my avoidant side reacting or if this is genuinely too much too soon. Any thoughts?",1,1766405885.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

We broke up on okay terms and didn’t really talk much after, but recently she’s been babysitting my little sister, so we’ve been around each other again. Over the past few weeks, we’ve started texting/snapping pretty regularly and hanging out in person whenever she’s over. I usually stay downstairs while she babysits, sometimes I cook dinner for all of us, and we end up talking or singing together (we’re both musicians).

Recently, she’s asked me to drive her places (Target, coffee, Christmas shopping), and one night she asked me to pick her up after work — we ended up out for about 3 hours and I bought her dinner. There’s a lot of joking/teasing in our texts, some light physical stuff like hugs, and she sometimes initiates plans or finds reasons to come inside and hang out longer. We’ve also talked openly about how we were basically kids when we dated and how we’ve both changed a lot since then.

The screenshots I’m posting are from three separate conversations on different days, not all from the same interaction. I’m not sure if this is just friendly comfort because of our history and the babysitting situation, or if this is subtle flirting / testing the waters.

1psy2xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1psy2xy/going_back_to_college_at_28_in_a_foreign_country/,Going back to college at 28 in a foreign country,"Hi! Long time visitor here, but here I am asking for advice and opinions for the first time.

Long story short - I am 28(M), live in a easter european country. Have a bachelor's in film and television. Spent 3 years working in a digital agency as a researcher, then spent the last three years working in hospitality. 

I plan to enroll in a bachelor's course this year in the Netherlands and study business. The plan is to finish a marketing master's after and hopefully start a career anywhere in Europe. 

Some things just hit my life at the wrong time. When I was finishing my first year in college, my mother died, which resulted in the remaining two years being spent in utter fog. After I just went into the job market and started working. Saw no meaningful course in marketing (at the time) and, for various reasons, went into hospitality. Currently work as a barista in a really good specialty coffee place. 

The thing is, there is no market in my country for anything. Pivoting into a career with a hiatus this long and no real connections means it's borderline impossible to actually find a job. A year ago, I applied to probably every job post related to marketing in my country, sent open letters, and unfortunately got nothing. When I think about what is possible for me in the next 5 years in my country, it comes down to 2 or 3 options, none of them great. The way I see it, going abroad, starting college from scratch, and actually specialising in a market with specific skills is going to yield a significant amount of options for me in my life. 

I have some savings, but I will still have to take out a student loan. 

I have some friends who are living, working, and/or studying in the NL who could help me settle in, find housing, and overall help me adjust.

I have a father and a sister who are willing to help me and actually were very glad to hear that I'm thinking about this, so in a way, I can rely on them even if just a little bit to help me financially. 

I guess the TL;DR would be - spent my twenties not really thinking about much, just dealing with life. Want to reset my career by studying abroad and starting to live my life deliberately.

Any opinions, advice, critiques or whatever is very welcome.

I want to share a recent experience in case it helps someone. I broke No Contact after a month,not because I had hope, but because I needed it for myself.

I posted here not long ago asking for tips on how to get over a 3-month situationship that ended almost two months ago. Many people told me to block him and delete the chat. But surprisingly, what helped me the most was sending him a message.

The uncertainty was too much; I needed to take back control of my life and accept reality. More than accepting it, I needed to confirm once and for all that it was really over.

My situationship had an unequal power dynamic and a significant age gap. Staying silent, waiting for a message I knew was never coming, felt more stressful and painful than any potential rejection. The anxiety of not knowing was consuming me.

So, I sent a simple message with zero expectations for a casual coffee meet up.

I’m 99% sure he’ll ghost me or not reply. But for my own peace of mind, I needed undeniable proof that he is not coming back. This wasn’t about self-esteem or respect (though those matter). It was about my specific circumstance, which required this step so I could finally rest.

Sometimes we need two or three moments of clarity to truly confirm that something is definitively over. Don’t feel ridiculous for needing that. You acted according to what you felt. If the other person doesn’t come back, then you know. That’s the confirmation you needed.

It reminds me of the phrase: “Of course you can go back, but there’s nobody left there.” Sometimes you need to feel that sense of abandonment to finally close the door and let go.

I’m sharing this for one reason: if you feel you need to send that last message for your own peace:for freedom, for closure; you’re allowed to do it.

Don’t be guided only by the “unwritten rules” of breakups or situationships. You can break those rules. It’s your life, and you have the freedom to choose. Of course, you’ll have to face the consequences (rejection, silence), but no one can force you to follow a script that feels like it’s hurting you.

I say this especially because we often turn these informal dynamics into a bureaucracy: we create a thousand rules, steps, and labels about how to act, how to feel, when to text, when to block… when in reality, only you know what you need to do to move forward.

Why so many rules? Sometimes you just need to act according to how you feel. Life sends you signals; what you’re going through is a lesson. Every relationship (or situationship) is unique and part of your personal journey.

Do No Contact if it works for you. Block if you need to. But you also have the freedom not to block, to send that last message. The ultimate goal should be your inner peace.

Don’t let other people’s experiences completely define yours. Listen to advice, reflect on it, and then act with caution and common sense.

Sending strength to everyone. Sometimes the bravest step isn’t staying silent, but speaking up so you can finally close the chapter.

P.S.:  I’ve written this post two weeks ago but I’m publishing now, and he hasn’t reply yet. Even though I haven’t gotten what I wished, I feel like a weight has been lifted. I already have the answer I needed. I’ve learned that, for me, certainty,no matter how painful, is far better than endless uncertainty.",1,1766405439.0,Situationships,0,1.0,False

Staff pleasant & knowledgable, but terribly overworked. Wonderful service from steward although we rarely saw him.

Dishes almost pulled away from us as we were eating on numerous occasions including specialty restaurants. Extremely rushed dining.

Buffet food just so so, but could always find something decent.

Food in specialty restaurants was pretty good, but many dishes, i.e., chicken extremely dry. 

Since we do not care for Starbucks coffee, we had to do ship's regular coffee.  Taste ranged from absolutely awful to just about passable on some days.

Fusion show was amazing.  Comedian was absolutely terrible. Not many laughs at all. People walked out during his performance.  I felt bad for him. 

Bartenders and cocktails were wonderful, especially at Gasby's which wasn't smoky as many reported in prior posts.  

Considering age of Dawn, it was in decent condition.  Some rust on bottom of balcony, but bathrooms, bed and cabins were fine.

I understand that NCL wanted guests to use phone for Freestyle Daily events, etc., but many people complained that they weren't internet savvy, others preferred paper version which was much easier to use.  Main complaint from guests at Guest Services seemed to be that one had to wait on a line to pick up a copy of Freestyle Daily which was available after 8pm for next day and give cabin number to obtain since only 1 copy given per cabin daily. We were told one could pick up copies after 8pm at restaurants, but twice were not available when we were there.

Don't think I'd cruise on the Dawn again even though the Tampa port is so close to home.

I use glass jars for things like rice, coffee, snacks, or even small screws and random items. Boxes end up holding cables, tools, skincare, or paperwork that I don’t want lying around. It’s not the prettiest setup, but it’s practical and saves money. Plus, with the humidity here, some containers actually help keep things dry and organized.

1psxuzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1psxuzy/i_developed_social_anxiety_as_an_adult_whos/,I developed social anxiety as an adult who’s always been social,"I (29f) have a newly developed social anxiety. 

A little bit of backstory: I’ve always enjoyed events and hanging out with friends. I was a bartender for years and could be described as charismatic, confident, cool, maybe even sassy or funny. I also did mma for a couple of years and it was a good outlet for my energy. I didn’t do many fights but I did attend a couple of jiujitsu competitions. 

2 years ago I decided to stop bartending, as it was getting emotionally draining. Despite being comfortable in social settings at the time, I’ve always been an introvert. I’m using ‘introvert’ in the context that I need my solitude to recharge before I go back into another social situation. (Extroverts are ‘charged’ when in they are around other people or social settings and drained when they spend too much time alone) 

Not long after deciding to take a step back, my fiancé and I discovered we were expecting a baby. I was very excited and I decided I wanted to be a SAHM because I wanted to spend as much time as I could with the baby. My fiancé makes 6 figures a year, so his income is enough to comfortably support our family. 

Motherhood has turned me into a different person. I think most, maybe even all mothers can agree in some way that we experience identity changes.

I love being a mother. I do a lot of outings with my baby (19months) such as mom groups, storytime at the library, music and dance classes for toddlers, library, park, etc. I am very involved as a parent, and I love pouring myself into my child and it’s very rewarding. 

In the last couple of years I noticed myself having social anxiety. A lot of times it was triggered when I feel put on the spot, but strangely it has happened even when I’m with someone I’ve always been comfortable around. If I’m at a bookstore and run into a friend, even if I’m happy to see them, my body just starts to betray me and panic. My heart rate speeds up, my mouth gets dry, I sweat from my face or hands and sometimes even shake. This has even happened with closer friends I’ve known for years if we hang out or meet up for coffee.

I do consider a lot about myself differently than before I was a mother. I’m much calmer. I don’t smoke (marijuana) anymore, I don’t drink anymore, I try not to cuss and I’m less confrontational. 

I haven’t been able to get back to jiujitsu regularly but I’ve attended a few women’s classes here and there. There’s still things I love doing including art, listening to music, cooking, gardening, and I’m very into reading. I still have a lot in common with my old friends so I don’t think it’s attributed to lack of anything in common. The anxiety is just something that has started to happen. It’s gotten so bad that one time when I saw a friend at Starbucks, we hugged said hey and in the middle of catching up I started to have a panic attack so bad that I walked away in the middle of a conversation and hid in the bathroom. 

Has anyone gone through anything similar? There were a couple of times as a teenager when I went to a new school that i experienced this feeling. Maybe a couple of times throughout my life leading up to a big event but it’s never been an issue like this so it seems like a new feeling I’ve been dealing with. How can I manage my emotions when I don’t even know why I’m feeling like this? Any advice is appreciated.

1psxsuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/voidpet/comments/1psxsuf/guide_for_beginners/,Guide for beginners,"I see a lot of posts from new players asking for advice. Whilst there are people further along than me I am at floor 2000 so think I can give some good advice. 

TYPE ADVANTAGE

Easy start point as it’s quite simple but very important. Fire is strong against metal, metal strong against wood, wood strong against earth, earth strong against water, water strong against fire. Strong types do 2x damage and weak types do 0.5x. Weak types are the cycle in reverse (fire weak against water etc.)

WHAT SHOULD MY TEAM LOOK LIKE?

As a general rule 2 fighters, 1 healer and 1 tank. Some tricky levels may require a switch such as 2 tanks but for most levels the first team is fine.

WHAT PETS SHOULD I USE? 

There are many tier lists on discord and Reddit and they are a good start point but they often lack information. I am going to stay away from legendary pets for now as they are rare. Now I agree that never say never but you should probably never use lonely, pain, curious or glee. 

I find most fighters are split being either good at floors or good at bosses. A rare few are good at both and a few are good at neither. Sad, anxious and apathy are good at both bosses and floors and are all good options to invest in. 

Good at bosses: paranoia and anger
Good at floors: panic, spite and wistful
Some other pets have specific rare uses but are normally outclassed by other pets.

Merry is the best support in the game there are better healers but its other moves give amazing versatility. Sonder is decent heals for the whole team. Wonder is very good single heals and also has good damage. Joy can be quite good but I’m not a huge fan of its heal. Don’t use lonely. Overall prioritise merry.

For the start of the game you only need 2 tanks. A main tank and a replacement for levels where enemies are strong against your main tank. Resistance and determination and considered the best tanks in the game. For later levels (and daily bosses) you should have 1 tank of each type. Best (or sometimes only) choices are resistance, determination, cringe, abandonment and conviction. Some legendary tanks such as petulance or maybe devotion are upgrades but others like scorn or rejection aren’t worth using.

LEGENDARY PETS

Mystery eggs have a 0.5% chance to give a legendary pet and astral eggs have a 9% chance. There is a pity system which means you are guaranteed a legendary pet on your 300th mystery egg or your 19th astral egg. If you get a legendary before then the pity resets to 0. Despite their rarity not all legendaries are good. It is hard for me to rate every legendary as I do not have them all but there are many tier lists which should be your first point of call. If you are unsure whether it is good compare it to your rare pets. For example if you got a legendary wood fighter, compare its moves to your current wood fighter. Is it worth using? Most legendaries are good but there are a few not worth it. 

ITEMS

item drop from every 5 floors and from using training keys on bosses. In the early game you will mostly get common and rare items. Whilst worth using they are not worth investing lots into. Not far into the game you will stay to get epic items but not all of them are worth using. Tanks want defense and stamina so you should focus on cowboy hat and scarf. Fighters and healers want a mix of attack, speed and crit so items that have some combination of those stats. Items that mix an offensive stat (attack/speed) with a defensive stat (stam/defense) are early worth investing in. Crit hit has a max stat of 44%, after this the other stat on the item will increase at a greater value for each level up. Every epic trinket is worth investing in and it is also worth investing in the rare offensive ones (iced coffee, leather journal, nail buffers and lychee candle). It is important to know that at first trinkets with just one stat have higher stats than trinkets which also have crit (e.g. fluffy pillow gives more Defense than gua shua) but once crit hit maxes out the other stat increases at a faster value. This means eventually the crit item will have a similar if not greater value for the other stat (e.g. eventually gua shua will have more defense than fluffy pillow). This means trinkets with crit are arguably more valuable long term than items without. 

LEGENDARY ITEMS

Legendary items have higher base stats than epic items and they also have bonus effects. You can find what each one does by going to item then dex which is in the top left. You can find all item drops from a specific boss by going to pets, dex then bosses.

TRAINING KEYS

each daily reset you get 10 keys which can be used to get xp or to fight bosses. For each key you use on a boss you get one item and you also get vm. For the first few hundred floors key are best used for xp. Later floors you should switch to bosses. A good time to use them for xp is when about to unlock a new evolution stone. This way you can level up pets to max level almost immediately to max level which I find is the fastest way to progress. 

GEMS

The best use for gems is training keys. It costs 200 for an extra 10 but for another 10 after that it increases to 400. I recommend saving at the start of the game when progression is easy and then spending 200 a day on keys. Another good option for gems later in the game is vivids. Do not spend gems on eggs it’s not worth it if you are trying to progress. Whilst you can spend them on the chest I would not recommend.

for context i deactivated all my accounts, made a friend change all the passwords so that i can't get them back, i used a pihole configuration on my router so that i can't connect to any time wasting site at home, and finally i used family link on my personal phone so that i can use only google maps, gmail, phone and web browser for 10 minutes a day  
it's a solid system and it works, it worked well for 4 months, i had to go out to a coffee shop to have access to reddit and write this post.  


now back to Istanbul, i took 0 pictures, it's all in my head, i didn't even take my work pc, usually i never travel without it.  


 i found out that i love museums, i went to every museum i can find on the map, i just go there and look at everything in details, i read every description, and i did loved it so much, i don't remember i had this feeling before, it's like i finally understand art.

i was alone there, i wake up very early in the morning, go for a walk, i started doing meditation lately (now i have time to experience new things), so i would walk while not thinking about anything, i would walk for very long distances every day, luckily i took my sport shoes with me.  
  
i have a breakfast in a coffee shop and i read a book there, it's a Turkish book called 'Ince memed', a book i read like 15 years ago when i was young and i loved it so much, so reading it again while being in Turkey felt very nice.

i enjoyed the cruise ride, crossing bridges, looking at mosques architecture, i was there the whole time.

one of things i like so much is looking at cites from a skyscraper roof, like the ones i see on NewYork movies, i found a building with a view deck access and i went there at night, the view was amazing, something about seeing high building with night lights just makes me happy, i had a note book at the time so i found a table and wrote about my life and what i should do next.

being off you phone gaves you time to look around, and wherever i go all i can see is people looking at their phone or taking pictures, i try not to be judgmental and i remind myself that i was like that just 4 months ago, so hopefully they will be free too one day, looking at them also made me understand that this is not how i want to live, i don't want to care about other people anymore, i don't want to impress anyone, i just want to live and experience life the way it should be done.

To-do lists felt like nagging, timers stressed me out, and “just be disciplined” made me want to close the app and lie down. So I tried something kind of silly that ended up working way better than expected: I turned my day into a game.

Nothing fancy. I give myself points for boring tasks I usually avoid. Shower = 5 XP. Answering emails = 10 XP. Starting the task I’m dreading = bonus points. I “level up” at the end of the day if I hit a certain score, and leveling up means I unlock something small but enjoyable (a show episode, a fancy coffee, guilt-free gaming, whatever).

The weird part? It actually works. Tasks feel lighter when they’re framed as moves instead of obligations. Even half-done days feel like progress instead of failure. I stopped thinking in terms of “I didn’t do enough” and started thinking “I gained some XP today.” It’s not perfect, and I still have off days, but it’s the first system that’s made consistency feel playable instead of punishing.

1psxkjv,https://i.redd.it/1c4ncunhtq8g1.jpeg,What Maxwell & Dershowitz didn’t want you to see | Sarah Ransome,"So you might have seen this part of a case filing that discusses Trump, Hillary & Bill Clinton, former prince Andrew & Richard Branson

This is the source: https://www.justice.gov/multimedia/Court%20Records/Giuffre%20v.%20Maxwell,%20No.%20115-cv-07433%20(S.D.N.Y.%202015)/1332-16.pdf

It is a document filed by Alan Dershowitz in the Giuffre v Maxwell case, in which Dershowitz argues that Sarah Ransome’s deposition (supporting Giuffre) should remain confidental and not made public. The quotes are from emails Sarah Ransome sent, and Dershowitz argues that based on these emails Ransome’s claims are ”uncredible” and ”outrageous” 

Key Timeline | Sarah Ransome

•  August 13, 1984: Sarah Ransome is born in South Africa.

•  2006: At age 22, Ransome moves to New York aspiring to study at the Fashion Institute of Technology. She alleges she was approached in a nightclub by a recruiter who introduced her to Epstein and Maxwell, promising help with school and career opportunities.

•  2006–2007: Ransome claims she was taken to Epstein’s properties, including his New York mansion and private island (Little St. James, U.S. Virgin Islands). She alleges repeated rape by Epstein (up to three times a day), threats of violence if she spoke out or tried to leave, and involvement by Maxwell in grooming and facilitating the abuse. She describes Maxwell as an “organizer” or “aristocratic pimp.” Ransome says she escaped in May 2007 by fleeing to the UK.

•  October 2016: Ransome contacts a New York Post journalist (Maureen Callahan), alleging possession of sex tapes filmed by Epstein showing Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Prince Andrew, and Richard Branson with underage girls or young women. These claims were not published at the time.

•  Late 2016: Ransome retracts the tape allegations in follow-up emails, citing fear for her family’s safety.

•  January 26, 2017: Ransome files a civil lawsuit (as Jane Doe 43) in New York federal court against Epstein, Maxwell, and others (including Sarah Kellen and Lesley Groff), alleging sex trafficking, coercion, and abuse.

•  2017: Ransome is deposed as a witness in Virginia Giuffre’s defamation lawsuit against Maxwell (Giuffre v. Maxwell). She provides photographs from Epstein’s island (showing young women, Epstein, and Maxwell) and reiterates her abuse allegations.

•  2018: Ransome’s lawsuit settles out of court for an undisclosed amount.

•  2019: In an interview with The New Yorker, Ransome admits she invented the sex-tape claims to draw attention to Epstein’s crimes and to deter him from harming her (by making him believe she had evidence).

•  2021: Ransome publishes her memoir, Silenced No More: Surviving My Journey to Hell and Back, detailing her alleged experiences. She speaks publicly during Maxwell’s criminal trial, calling Maxwell worse than Epstein.

•  June 28, 2022: Ransome speaks publicly as a named victim at Maxwell’s federal sentencing hearing in New York, advocating for a harsh sentence (Maxwell receives 20 years).

•  January 2024: Court documents from Giuffre v. Maxwell are unsealed, including Ransome’s 2016–2017 emails and deposition. The tapes allegations resurface but are noted as retracted/fabricated. Ransome later appears on UK TV (Good Morning Britain), standing by the existence of tapes and claiming her prior retraction was due to threats from Epstein/Maxwell.

CORE ALLEGATIONS & FACTS

•  Abuse Claims: Ransome consistently alleges she was lured with promises of educational/financial help, then coerced into sexual acts with Epstein. She describes threats to her life and family, starvation, beatings, and psychological manipulation (trauma bonding). She was older than many victims (22 at recruitment), which Maxwell’s defense once argued made her involvement “consensual” (a claim Ransome disputes).

•  Role of Maxwell: Ransome portrays Maxwell as central in recruitment, organization, and abuse facilitation—e.g., smirking after assaults or acting maternally to build dependency.

•  Sex Tapes Controversy: Ransome’s 2016 claims implicated Clinton (“likes them young”), Trump (regular encounters in NY mansion), Prince Andrew, and Branson. No evidence of such tapes has been made public. She retracted them shortly after, and in 2019 admitted fabrication for protection and publicity. In 2024, she reversed again, claiming threats forced the retraction. All named individuals have denied wrongdoing; spokespeople cite her admitted invention as proof of baselessness.

•  Credibility Notes: Defense attorneys (e.g., for Alan Dershowitz) have highlighted the retracted tapes to question her reliability. However, Ransome has maintained her personal abuse allegations across depositions, her book, and public statements. She provided photos to courts (unsealed in 2024) showing island activities in 2006.

•  Outcomes: Ransome settled civilly and contributed to Maxwell’s prosecution indirectly (via victim statements). She has advocated for survivors and expressed vindication after Maxwell’s 2021 conviction and 2022 sentencing.

The good

* Already on the day I quit it felt like a subtle source of anxiety fell away, like a subtle nagging that kept me anxious most of the time. I thought that's just the way I am, turns out caffeine could have played a big part in it
* Yesterday (Sunday) afternoon I already noticed the fog is lifting, like theres a relaxed source of energy in me that got activated. Kind of a surprise, because I'm used to a sort of crash in the late afternoon. Today on Monday it was already like this in the morning. Still feels relaxed and like the energy is coming from me and not from being pushed, it's nice

Neutral

* Starting in the afternoon the day I quit I felt some brain fog, very similar to jetlag. I was mostly able to lean into this sleepy feeling, no problem
* Sleep has surprisingly been a lot lighter and a bit longer, didn't seem to make a difference during the day though
* I miss the kick and euphoria I got from caffeine a bit, the feeling of ""let's go"" after an energy drink in the afternoon for example. Usually I think that lasted maybe up to 30 minutes and I wasn't more productive for sure, so fuck that

Not so nice

* Felt a lot more vulnerable and hat trouble making decisions during the weekend. This could also have been caused in combination with outer circumstances but I'm 100% sure I wouldn't have been as affected without the withdrawal
* Sunday afternoon light muscle aches started, mostly around the buttocks area. These aches got more intense and moved to my legs when I went to bed and kept me awake for 2 hours or so, wasn't the nicest feeling but still very much ok. Now on Monday it's still there a bit, hope it doesn't come back in the evening. Will hydrate more and take magnesium...

My boyfriend got really fucking drunk at a work  party and when his co worker kissed him he kissed back, twice. He didn’t remember the next morning and remembered when he was at work the next day, and called me to tell me what happened right after his shift. He feels like she took advantage of him in a bad situation, she knew about me, and he had told her about me that night, but he still knows he fucked up bad. 

To make matters more complicated I am finishing up my gap year, i’m home in 2 weeks from a year in the UK (I’m from NZ, which is where he is, and we haven’t seen each other all year), so we’ve been long distance since January, our relationship has been wonderful for the most part, we dated for 9 months before I left and we have a deep and beautiful connection, everything is fun as long as we’re together, and we can talk about anything and everything, from silly stuff, to complex politics, we really like and get on well with each others families. As well as being massively attracted to each other, and our intimate life being amazing. 

I have been torn about this the whole week since he’s told me, we’ve talked a lot and he feels devastated, he has quit drinking and is working on better coping mechanisms, he had no contact with the co worker before this and has blocked her on everything since, when he saw her at work he reiterated that all their contact at work was going to be professional, and other then work talk he blanked her attempts to talk to him, none of his other co workers know or saw what happened. He is also looking for another job, due to this situation plus the fact that it’s a horrible place to work in general, but if you know anything about the NZ job market atm, it’ll be a while before he lands another job.

I don’t believe that what he did defines who he is as a person, I think there was a lot of factors, and he’s been open and honest with me about everything he remembers from that night. There is no emotion involved and he is not attracted to her, he’s had panic attacks at work and with friends remembering what happened, and hasn’t been able to eat or sleep properly. I do believe that he wouldn’t do this again. However he has this time, and it’s broken my trust and my heart. 

However we were going through a rough week or two before this happened as well, he’s been carrying most of the heavy emotional weight of the relationship through my year away (my mental health has been on the rocks, he completely supported me through that, and his mental health was at a low as well but he didn’t open up as much as I did, as he didn’t want to put the weight on me), however he wasn’t putting much effort into other areas of the relationship like communication that I didn’t initiate and dates. So I feel that is something to address as well. 

I feel like I need some time away from the relationship to heal, as I don’t know how to handle the stress of a massive move home, re setting up my life and my connection with friends and family, and a routine, as well as finding myself again, as I’ve been in survival mode this year and have lost most of the soft girly parts of myself I want to get back. 

However I want him and our relationship back, but he needs to heal as well, and I can’t carry that. Is it bad to take say 6 months apart and let what happens happen, and after 6 months meet up for a walk or a coffee and figure out where to go from there. I’ve introduced this idea to him and he feels torn about it, he doesn’t want to not be in a relationship with me, he’s worried about losing me to another man, but if this is what I need I think he will accept it, and i’ve made it clear that if he met someone in our time apart that that is allowed. I also made it clear that the point of the break up for me would not be to date around or try another men, as I didn’t think it would be fair to other people when I’m still in love with him. 

I don’t know if I want a clean break with him, our connection is deep and meaningful and we are so in love, however this has deeply hurt me and I know it will take time to heal from both what has happened and this year. 

Any advice? 

tl;dr
My boyfriend kissed another girl when extremely drunk, I need space to heal from this and other things, is this 100% the end for us?

It's in a WeWork but I'd go in about 6 times a month. People I work with are top notch.

I have a SM offer at PwC and the domain looks awesome and the team I've met seem great too.

However, moving to PwC would be a pay cut on salary (I get a 30% bonus atm) as well as additional expenses and time spent having to travel in 3 days a week.  I also would miss out on all the start up perks like unlimited barista coffee at WeWork, free snacks, drinks, beers, and shed loads of social events and meals.

I feel like if I join PwC I will need to go balls out and make partner or it's not worth it.

My gut feeling is that the start up job is great as a job, but less so for career. I can also spend more time with my kids before they go to school full time.

However, Reddit posts are shouting about of 'burn outs, redundancies, low util firing, and low pay compared to real hours worked'.

Ideally I'd actually join PwC in a couple years when my kids are at school, but I don't know how often these opportunities come up.

I did once before turn down PA then text the partner and they offered me another role, but then I turned that down too because they wanted me to close my side business!

Any thoughts and insights would be great, are my assumptions madness?
Is it worth joining big four just to have the stamp on my CV?

Am I kidding myself and not be fussed about PwC or is it as great an opportunity as I imagine?",0,1766403006.0,PwC,0,0.33,False

FIRST 5 MINUTE SUMMARY: Anderson gets a banana first thing in the morning. Our gorl is making “family breakfast” of donut pancakes, SUGAR FREE bacon, & eggs and she is SO excited. Oh noes she doesn’t have buttermilk but makes do with oatmilk. We get a slow ass montage of her cooking, making her creamer coffee while changing in size depending on where she stands in front of the camera. She uses a shit ton of butter to make the pancakes in the pan then coats them with brown sugar. Seems to have made only 3 pancakes. They wave the plate in his face then take it away which causes him to cry because he wants some, then Big Al and Yar eat them first saying Anderson has to wait until they cool down before he can have any. We never see Al’s plate but she claims she only made half of the batter. Yar is feeding Anderson (but Al, I thought that was YOUR new tradition with Anderson?) She said Mimi’s dog was attacked by another dog but “he’s okay” but also “his arm was dangling?” Max is still at the vet so things are up in the air for cookie day, oh no! What will she ever do if she can’t make a pan of sugar cookies at Mimi’s?! Like I can’t with this woman.

You Know the drill. Watch without giving her a direct view or if you don’t want to wait for reaction channels.

I’ve been in no contact with my ex for about a month now (save one wellbeing text), but I’ve been thinking about my own patterns, and it made me really sad because I realised I couldn’t accept any of her safety?

She wanted to do nice things for me like bring soup when I was sick or keep my favourite snacks (which you can’t find easily where we live) stocked in her cupboards, and I nearly broke up with her, it just made me too uncomfortable! Every time we had a moment where she wanted me to be vulnerable, I’d skate over it or give her a fraction of the story. I would choose to pull back, I could feel it in the moment and would brush it off with jokes or physical affection. I’d obviously give her SOME vulnerability, but it was a level I felt safe at and didn’t really come close to matching hers. 

She was vulnerable though, she told me some really big things and she let me take care of her when she was sick, even though I know she felt the same way I did about receiving kindness. I know this isn’t WHY we broke up, but it sucks realising how much I pushed her away when I’ve spent so much of my life wishing that someone would be that nice to me. 

We broke up because she was overwhelmed by life and our relationship wasn’t helping that (we’d both admitted that we loved each other but were shit scared of how we felt prior to the breakup). I know that’s not completely on me and she has similar attachment struggles to me, but I can’t help but feel I did a crap job providing a safe space with how guarded I was being.

I was constantly on edge, and I moved us onto the next stage of the relationship too quickly because I thought I’d feel safer if we did (spoiler: it didn’t work), but I didn’t want to walk it back because I’d asked for it and I didn’t want to lose her 😭 but then it turned out that she wasn’t ready either, so I lost her anyways.

I’m going to text her when we’re both back from the holidays and give her the cliff notes of my realisation. Hopefully she’ll accept going for a coffee, I think the worst bit about this is that because we were so similar I can’t help but feel that we could really help each other if we could just stay 😭

I can kind of control my CH episodes or reduce the pain when I am having one. In my case, it has all to do with slightly shifting my jaw to one side of the head depending on which side you experience your CHs (left to right if your CH is on the left side of the face).

My theory is that depending on how the jaw sits with the skull, it compresses the trigeminal nerve and that over the course of hours and days will result in CH.

As my CHs are on the left side of the face, what I do is to sleep either on my belly or on the side, with the left side of the face touching the pillow, with enough pressure that it slightly shifts/dislodges the jaw towards the right. You should feel a small amount of pressure but it shouldn't be painful, you're putting too much pressure with your head on the pillow. I do this for roughly a week, policing myself to stay all night sleeping with the left side of my face on the pillow, and with the help of preventives/abortives I was able to stop this cycle in its tracks.

If I'm in the middle of an episode, I open my mouth slightly and shift my jaw to the right just as much so my upper and lower right canines are touching. This reduces the pain a bit.

For preventives/abortives, I tried many things, and for some reason coffee works wonderfully for me as a preventive. Red Bull not as much. If I feel the shadow, that slight elevation in pressure along the nerve, I quickly drink an espresso and it tends to stop the episode from appearing.

If your pain is on the right side of the face, you can try sleeping with that side on the pillow.

And if you dont notice any improvement within a week, try a different side, maybe that works differently for you or how your jaw is sitting on your skull.

This was a bit disorganized writing but hopefully it can help someone at some point.",2,1766400787.0,clusterheads,0,1.0,False
1pswpo6,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ideP66evEHM,Robin Vane - Jesus Christ [Electronic],"Robin Vane’s “Jesus Christ” is a beautiful EDM track with a powerful message. A message, or better said, a testimony, that you’d expect to hear across a coffee table, or during an informal church gathering. It’s raw, honest, and quietly brave. The song starts by looking back to a younger self, when he *“had no hope”* and *“stopped believing,”* stuck in a season where it was *“dark,”* lonely, and defeating. In other words, it names the kind of despair many people hide, even today, including our younger generations.

Robin continues to sing about when the turning point hit: Jesus *“knocked on the door,”* and how he opened up to *“love in the flesh.”* He also sings about what happened when Grace found him before he was able to clean himself up… Robin shares, *“I surrendered and fell to my knees,”* and *“I was weeping for the first time.”* That moment became a line in the sand for Robin: “I will never be the same.” What happened to Robin can, in one way or another, also happen to you. You don’t need to first “clean yourself up” before Grace can come knocking at your door! We have a magnificent God whose Grace takes you as you are and works to change your heart and life (if you let Him).

Instead of attempting self-reliance, we may rely on Him: *“I surrender all… hold on tight… to Jesus Christ.”* After more than shame, storms, and *“burned… bridges,”* it is His mercy that always pulls you through. Robin reminds us that Jesus is *“always there,”* nearer than doubt, and breathing new life into your tired soul.

So, go ahead and take the next step. Listen closely to the lyrics and the message behind Robin’s words. May this song spark your own prayer: *“Search me, Lord… Take my heart.”*",1,1766400733.0,ChristianMusicReview,0,1.0,False

However, I'm posting this as a reminder. I'm on vacation in Cape Town South Africa. And the difference between how men treat me here vs in America is kinda night and day. For instance, I've been hit up by straight 9's and 10's. Guys in their 20's, very in-shape, handsome. Of different races too. White, Black, Mixed, French, etc. And they were jumping in my DM's. TNow, when I share my face pics at home, a 60% I will get blocked. But here? I've only been blocked once. And everyone else was quick to call me handsome/gorgeous. One guy was literally like ""You're so handsome no wonder everyone was looking at you."" Another guy said ""Put the pretty little face in between my legs."" 

  
I even had a French real estate agent (who rode the fuck out of my dick. Like, Hand on my neck telling me how pretty I am the whole time). He kept telling me how gorgeous I was. He then asked me if my muscle was natural, if I was on steroids. I told him no, he said ""Oh wow I like that."" I even had multiple guy asking to go out on a date. Like a coffee date. I even had to turn down a couple (Both 20's in-shape, white) who hit me up. t really did surprise me because I get none of this trip oof action at home. At home it's crickets. lol. I get ignored so much at home. So I was highly surprised at all this. 

  
I've even been checked out by girls/women here too. I went out walking with my family at a pretty ritzy shopping area yesterday, and actively saw at least 6 girls blatantly check me out as I was walking by. Even my Mom commented on it. I saw one girl just stare at me from across the mall. Like a good 15-second stare. Ngl, I waist a very goo outfit, and I did hit the gym earlier. But that's besides the point. Me and one girl made eye-contact and she still kept checking me out. lol. I even saw a couple guys looking me up and down too. 

  
But anyway, get out of your main area and you'l be surprised how people react to you. ",0,1766400696.0,askgaybros,2,0.25,False
1pswp7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1pswp7o/how_long_did_it_take_you_to_feel_elvanse_wasnt/,How long did it take you to feel Elvanse wasn't the one for you?,"I started Elvanse 30mg two weeks ago and I strongly suspect it isn't the medicine for me, but I'm not sure. I'd really like to hear from people who who have had a rocky experience with it, too.

Here's what I've noticed so far...

**Pros:**

* **My mood has improved** and is more regulated; I'm less reactive to things that would otherwise irritate me or send me off the deep end. It's a little easier to be around people. As someone who suffers from depression and anxiety, this alone is a relief.
* **My impulsivity has diminished.** I've bought less frivolous things in the last couple weeks than I usually would to get that dopamine hit (booze, junk food, etc), and think more carefully about the things I *do* buy.

**Cons:**

* **My sleep has been** ***terrible*** **since night one.** I'm getting 2-5 hours a night, waking up in the middle or waking up early or both (one morning I thought it was improving, but the next night proved me wrong). I feel this tiredness exacerbates my ADHD symptoms and perhaps counteracts the benefits of the medicine.
* **I find myself jumping from distraction to distraction more rapidly** (e.g., reading this thing will remind me of that thing which will remind me of another thing, etc). Whereas before I was able to control that a little better.
* **My short term memory seems worse.** It's harder for me to hold an intention or reminder in my head long enough to act on it.
* **Task initiation feels worse.** It's just as hard (if not harder) to just *do* things. Chores and projects I've been needing to do actually seem *more* daunting.
* **Focus hasn't improved.** I still have just as much trouble not spacing out and comprehending what someone is saying or what I'm reading. I also have just as much trouble recalling words and expressing thoughts coherently.

*(I'm sure there are more things I wanted to add, but I can't remember 😅)*



I'd like to know...

**Did you have a similar experience?**

**Did you switch from Elvanse? If so, to what? Has that been a better experience?**

**Did you decide to stick with it and found it improved with the next dose?**

  
I'm going through a private psych and can only afford to titrate once a month. I know everyone's experience differs, but any feedback you can give me would be incredibly valuable in deciding what I'd like to do at my next appointment.

Thanks so much in advance!



*Here's some additional info, if it helps:*

* *My appetite is suppressed, but I track my food daily and am making sure I'm eating just as much as I always have.*
* *I take my pill at 7am with a high-protein breakfast and electrolytes.*
* *I have one small coffee in the morning and that's it (I've tried days without coffee and ironically my sleep was worse those nights).*
* *I drink plenty of water.*
* *I go to bed at the same time every night and fall asleep within my normal timeframe.*
* *My blood pressure is normal.*

*I tried two other medicines in 2024 in the summer for 2 months, but because of finances I couldn't continue:*

* ***Medikinet 20mg IR.*** *I felt an immediate positive affect on this. Mind was clearer. Mood was lifted. I could absorb more of what someone was saying to me. I didn't struggle so much to express my thoughts coherently. It was less of a struggle to just do something. No sleep issues. The only thing I didn't like was the effect window was only 2 hours, and I wanted something longer lasting, so I decided to try Concerta. Maybe I should've tried Medikinet XL?*
* ***Concerta XL 36mg.*** *I felt no noticeable changes on this. Not better, not worse. Maybe I needed to try the next dose up? But like I said, I ran out of money by that time. Long story as to why I'm now trying Elvanse...*

  
I'm sorry for such a long post, but I'm grateful to those who read through it, and I'd be very grateful for any experience you could share with me.",1,1766400681.0,ADHDUK,3,1.0,False

1pswmqn,https://i.redd.it/in44k2rziq8g1.png,Books & Brew comes to Pune,"Hey Pune!

I've recently moved here and I'm looking to start a local chapter of Books and Brew, a book club I've been part of for over 2 years in NCR.

**How it works:**

* We pick one book each month for everyone to read
* We meet once a month (weekends) to discuss it over coffee
* Book selection rotates, everyone gets a turn to propose their pick, so all genres are fair game

Venues will rotate around Pune depending on what's convenient for the group.

To kick things off, we'll start with a few casual meetups (think ""best book you read this year"" kind of conversations) so we can get to know each other before diving into the monthly reads.

1pswk2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/backrooms/comments/1pswk2x/the_backrooms_by_onyx_woods/,The Backrooms by Onyx Woods,"Chapter 0: Lara \~ Late Evening

Lara glanced briefly at the clock. It was already past ten.  
Her reflection was faintly visible in the window: tired eyes, messy hair, her back hunched in a posture that would give any orthopedist nightmares. She looked like her mother—always escaping into work while her private life quietly fell apart. Lara had sworn she would be different. Life had long since proved her wrong.

Here she was, alone in an empty office, while everyone else had been gone for hours, probably stretched out on their couches watching shows. Tonight was worse than usual. The new boss didn’t like her—she was sure of it. From the very first introduction, when he’d greeted her with that fake smile and squeezed her hand just a little too hard, she’d known they wouldn’t be friends. And she’d been right. He was never satisfied—not with her work, not with her motivation, not even with her clothes. One could only guess what his problem was, and why he’d decided to latch onto her in particular.

She was sick of being picked apart by him every single time. But she was too stubborn to quit.

Tomorrow she had another one of those awful review meetings, and of all days, there was an error somewhere in her calculations that she just couldn’t find, no matter how hard she tried. If she didn’t fix it, it would be a gift-wrapped feast for him. And she was absolutely not going to give him that satisfaction.

The rest of the office lay silent. Only her monitor glowed in the darkness. The harsh light made her eyes ache. Between the desks, the rolling cabinets stood like mute blocks; everywhere the same Post-its, the same mugs, the same half-empty glasses of water. Somewhere in the distance, the ventilation system hummed. Nothing else. No creaking chairs, no murmurs, no footsteps. No other person.

Lara yawned, arched her back, and tried to breathe the exhaustion away. The fourth coffee hadn’t made her more alert—just shaky. Her concentration was gone for good. Even if the error in the spreadsheet suddenly started flashing red, she’d probably miss it.

Maybe cold water would help. And a few minutes of movement.

The hallway was empty. The motion sensors switched on with a slight delay as she passed. A row of fluorescent lights flickered briefly, then steadied. She didn’t like the building at night. The familiar corridors suddenly felt foreign—too long, too quiet. Her thoughts grew louder the quieter everything around her became. She wondered where her ex was right now. She hoped karma would eventually get around to him.

In the women’s restroom, she turned the faucet only halfway. She held her hand underneath, waited until the water was properly cold, then leaned forward. The icy splash against her face was like a slap—but the good kind. Goosebumps crept over her arms and neck. She looked into the mirror: sallow skin, red eyes, flushed cheeks. No surprise after fourteen hours.

Maybe it would be best to just give up and look for something new after all. Starting over was annoying, sure—but maybe there was even more money somewhere else. Why was she putting herself through this, anyway?

She pulled the last paper towel from the dispenser, patted her face dry, and tossed it away. When she opened the door again, the hallway felt even quieter than before. The ventilation was still running, but softer now, as if the pressure were missing. Lara paused for a moment, irritated, without quite knowing why. Then she continued toward her office, telling herself she was just working herself up over nothing again.

After a few steps, she heard a sound.

A dull thud—not loud, but so unexpected that she stopped instantly. It sounded like something had tipped over. The noise came from the end of the hall, where the small janitor’s closet was located. It had been sealed off for a week—renovations.

“No one is allowed in there,” they’d told her. “Not even the janitor.”

She listened. Nothing.

Then, after a few seconds, there was a faint scraping sound.

“Mr. Schubert?” she called down the hallway.

No answer.

Great. She definitely hadn’t imagined that noise. But who would still be in the building at this hour?

She hesitated, then started walking down the corridor anyway. The carpet ended, linoleum began, slightly springy beneath her steps. The yellow caution tape in front of the closet hung loose, as if someone had simply pushed it aside.

“Hello?”

She pushed the door open. The light was on—a single fluorescent tube on the ceiling, flickering slightly. The room was barely three square meters: two metal shelves with cleaning supplies, a bucket, a stack of rags. The smell of chlorine stung her nose.

A shallow puddle spread across the floor. The water came from a leaky hose under the sink—drip by drip, always in the same spot, until it formed a small trail leading toward the wall.

“Well then,” she muttered. “So much for ‘sealed off.’”

She crouched down and tightened the tap until the dripping stopped. For a moment, water still trickled out, then only a thin thread, and finally nothing at all.

She straightened up; some vague sense of duty had been fulfilled, and she was just about to leave when her gaze caught on the shelves. The back panel didn’t seem to merge directly with the wall behind it. Between metal and concrete was a narrow gap—almost invisible, but deep.

Lara squinted. There was no plaster behind it. No concrete.

Just darkness.

She leaned closer. A draft brushed against her. It didn’t smell damp. Not dusty. Not like chlorine. Really, it didn’t smell like anything at all.

A dull clatter made her spin around.

Just the stupid broom that had tipped over.

Still, her heart was racing now. “Damn it.”

She took two steps toward the door and peeked into the hallway. The lights out there were flickering more strongly now; entire rows went out briefly, then snapped back on. The motion sensor reacted as if something were standing in the corridor—something she couldn’t see.

“Is anyone there?”

No answer. Just the hum of electricity.

But the tingling at the back of her neck grew stronger.

Lara stepped back into the janitor’s closet, and a sound behind her made her whirl around on the spot.

There was—nothing. Just shelves, cleaning supplies, a bucket.

She looked again at the gap behind the shelf. Something was different. The shelf stood slightly farther into the room, as if someone had pushed it forward just a bit.

She pulled her phone from her pocket and switched on the flashlight. The beam cut through the gap—and revealed an opening. After just a few centimeters, the light was swallowed by black depth.

“Okay…” she murmured.

She stretched out her hand, placed her fingers on the edge, and felt along it. Her hand slid farther in than she’d expected, into empty space, without hitting brickwork or pipes.

The light in the closet began to flicker. Once. Twice. Then it grew dimmer, as if someone had turned down the color setting. The fluorescent tube was still on, but the light was warmer now, yellowish, making the room look old and unfamiliar.

This building really deserved a complete renovation.

She took a step back. Her back bumped into the other shelf; bottles clinked softly. A brief electrical click sliced through the air. Lara held her breath.

She should just leave. This definitely wasn’t her problem.

But curiosity edged past reason. Why hide a passage in a janitor’s closet of an office building?

She leaned forward again and shone the light deeper inside. The draft grew colder. Her phone’s flashlight began to flicker slightly, as if the battery were suddenly weakening.

Just a quick look. No one has to know.

She grabbed the shelf with both hands and pushed it aside. It squealed across the floor, then stopped—just far enough for her to squeeze through sideways.

Lara took a deep breath and stepped into the darkness.

Above her, a weak light flickered on: a trembling strip along the ceiling. She stood in a long, gray, old corridor. Bare concrete, cold floor, walls without paint. Nothing exciting.

So much for that.

She turned around to go back—and froze.

The janitor’s closet was gone.

Behind her was nothing but a smooth concrete wall.

Her phone flickered once more—and went out.

**Title:** Initial Stabilization of a Resonant Boundary Layer  
**Author:** PROMETHEUS — Field Unit 0x07  
**Date:** \[Fragment: presumed 2012–2018\]

Summary:  
After twelve months of iterative calibration of the resonance chamber, trial run 47 succeeded in generating a measurably stable spatial interphase for the first time.

The theoretical foundation is based on the work of Prof. Dr. Emil Kasten (†), who in 1998 coined the term *Backrooms* to describe a hypothetical, unbounded intermediary continuum. Until now, the existence of such a structure had remained unverified.

Experimental Setup:  
• Resonance chamber volume: 2.4 m³, shielded.  
• Magnetic fields: dual-coil system (counter-modulated, frequency delta < 0.02 Hz).  
• Energy input: 4.3 kW peak; stabilization via dampened feedback loop.  
• Observation: interferometric measurement + multispectral video capture.  
• Environmental conditions: pressure 101.3 kPa, temperature 19 °C.

Observations:  
• After \~2.9 s runtime, a phase deviation of 0.002 rad was recorded.  
• Optical instruments showed brief luminance fluctuations; no discernible image.  
• Magnetometers reported implausible field inversion (< 1 ms), followed by stabilization.  
• Subjective perception among personnel: mild cranial pressure sensation, sound resembling distant electrical hum (not independently confirmed).  
• Field configuration remained stable for 4.12 s before automatic termination by control algorithm.

Assessment:

1. The effect confirms for the first time that a controlled, locally confined spatial interphase can be generated through technical means.
2. Observed anomalies suggest a genuine coupling to a previously inaccessible spatial structure.
3. No data exists regarding the internal composition of said structure.
4. No visual or physical penetration occurred.
5. Further trials are being prepared to maintain the field for longer durations and, if feasible, deploy a probe.

Note:  
The involved researchers emphasize that, at present, no hypothesis can be made regarding stability, extent, or physical parameters of the resulting space.  
Until reproducible conditions are demonstrated, any attempt at direct contact is to be excluded.

# volunteer_request.txt — INTERNAL CALL

**Subject:** Request for Recruitment of Volunteer Test Subjects for Controlled Interior Assessment Interaction (CAI) — Initial Stabilization Cohort

1. Purpose
2. The purpose of this document is the formal request to recruit a limited cohort of volunteer test subjects to conduct a visual and physiological exploration / assessment of the short-lived spatial interphase generated during experimental run PRIME\_RUN\_0001 (hereafter referred to as “Interphase”), under strictly controlled conditions.
3. This measure serves the primary objective of acquiring empirical data on the structural and biological characteristics of the Interphase and may proceed only after fulfillment of all safeguards outlined in Section 3.
4. Background
5. As documented in /sn3/tmp/first\_bridge.txt (PRIME\_RUN\_0001), a temporally stable interphase was generated for the first time. At present, only peripheral observable effects are available; no primary interior description exists.
6. Theoretical models (P-3) indicate a non-classical spatial configuration with potential physico-biological deviations from known parameters. A dedicated, controlled first-entry study is required to validate hypotheses and quantify hazard potential.
7. Preconditions / Safety Requirements (MUST be met prior to recruitment)
8. a. Approval: Full authorization by the interdisciplinary Oversight Board (medical, physical, ethical).
9. b. Isolation: Expanded containment infrastructure beyond SN-3 (physical airlock chambers, redundant air/particle filtration, cold-chain capability for samples).
10. c. Emergency Protocols: Validated extraction and quarantine procedures; standby teams (medical/forensic) on 24/7 availability.
11. d. Sensor Systems: Redundant telemetry (biometric, video, field measurements); invasive sensors only with additional approval and ethical review.
12. e. Legal Framework: Complete legal clearance, liability waivers, and transparent informed consent documentation.
13. Volunteer Profile (Selection Criteria)
14. a. Age: 25–45 years.
15. b. Health: Fully screened; no chronic cardiopulmonary, immunological, or neurological conditions; PCR and serological status within normal limits for standard infections. Pregnancy tests for individuals with a uterus: negative.
16. c. Psychology: Successful completion of psychological evaluation (stress resilience, reality testing; no diagnosed psychosis risk; no history of suicidality).
17. d. Implants / Devices: No implanted medical devices; no active neurostimulators.

# Chapter 2: Lara ~ The Corridor

At first, Lara couldn’t believe what she was seeing. There was no other way to explain it: where the door to the janitor’s closet had been just moments ago, there was now nothing but a smooth concrete wall. No frame. Not even the faintest suggestion of a passage.

“Did you hit your head?” she asked herself under her breath.

Maybe she was actually lying unconscious on the floor between cleaning supplies, and all of this was just some incoherent dream.

But the concrete felt real.

The corridor she was standing in was narrow, raw, gray—and so dimly lit that the light did little more than hint at a vague strip of floor in front of her. Slim ceiling lamps hung at regular intervals, each casting only a dull circle of light onto the cement. Between them lay dark stretches where the corridor seemed to disappear entirely.

Slowly, she turned in a full circle. To the left and right, the corridor stretched on endlessly, without windows, without doors, without any point of reference that might tell her where she was. She raised a hand, ran it along the wall, felt the rough surface, the fine dust clinging to her fingertips. She knocked on the concrete—first carefully, then harder. The dull sound made it hard to believe there was a room behind it.

“No… no, this can’t be happening,” she murmured.

The thought came automatically, like a reflex of self-defense. Because she had no explanation.

She turned left and walked a few steps, only to stop again after a few meters. The corridor looked the same in both directions—equally empty, equally cold.

And now?

She forced herself to breathe more slowly. Her mind rattled, desperately searching for a plausible version of reality. Maybe she was just completely overworked. Fourteen hours straight, hardly any breaks, too much coffee—maybe she’d nodded off in the office and was dreaming some kind of bullshit.

She dug her fingernails deep into her forearm. Pain shot through her instantly. Real. Far too real for a dream.

Lara took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and silently counted to five, the way she did when everything at the office felt like it was about to collapse on top of her.

One.  
Two.  
Three.  
Four.  
Five.

When she opened her eyes again, the corridor was still there. Gray. Dull. Endless.

A feeling crept up her spine, cool and insidious. It reminded her of that childhood terror—getting lost between the aisles of a department store and suddenly realizing there was no familiar person in sight.

She leaned her forehead against the wall, closed her eyes again, and tried to listen.

Nothing.

Even the air seemed motionless.

Get a grip. You’re not a child.

The feeling of being watched came without warning. It started as a pressure deep in her stomach and crept up into her chest. She held her breath and slowly turned around.

The light ended after maybe ten meters, swallowed by dense blackness. Beyond that, nothing was visible—and yet it felt as though something was there.

There was no movement. No sound. Just that certainty, that burning prickle on the skin you get when someone is staring at you.

Lara forced herself to look away. This was ridiculous. There was nothing there. There had to be nothing there.

Even so, her muscles stayed tense.

She wrapped her arms around herself to control the shaking and started walking—in the opposite direction.

Walking helped. One step after another. Somewhere, this damn corridor had to end. Even if this place was deeply strange.

An old emergency exit? Fire escape, maybe?

But the longer she walked, the stronger the feeling became that the shadows behind her were growing denser.

She stopped abruptly and spun around.

The corridor looked the same as before. And yet the section that had been visible just moments ago now seemed shorter, as if the darkness had crept closer.

Instinctively, she sped up. Her breathing quickened as she tried to convince herself that none of this could be *real*. Nothing was following her. There was no one there. There was nothing.

And yet the space behind her felt thicker, as though something invisible were pressing forward, closing in without revealing itself.

Then she saw it.

At some distance, something metallic glimmered in the pale light.

Lara stopped.

A door. Finally.

Relief and panic collided inside her at the same time. This was enough adventure for today—for this year, for an entire lifetime. If she got out of here—whatever *here* was—she would get straight into her car, drive home, and tomorrow tell her boss exactly where he could shove his performance review. It was hard to imagine anything more humiliating than being stuck somewhere in a tunnel like this.

The door was heavy, with a handwheel in the center, like the airlock to a maintenance room. It smelled of cold iron.

Maybe this wasn’t even an exit.

For a moment, she considered simply walking past it—onward, always onward, until she found something that clearly meant *out*. But the thought of moving even farther away from the only visible deviation in the endless corridor made her stomach clench.

She raised her hand, hesitated.

Once before, a passage had vanished the moment she used it. What if it happened again? What if she opened this door, stepped through—and everything behind her sealed itself shut, with no way back? What if, instead of an emergency exit, she ended up even deeper in this concrete labyrinth?

While she was still hesitating, the light around her changed. Not dramatically—more like a barely noticeable dimming. But the shadows behind her seemed to stir, as if the already weak light were being swallowed by something drawing closer.

Lara felt herself grow hot and ice-cold at the same time. Sweat gathered beneath her blouse; her neck prickled.

Enough.

She placed both hands on the wheel.

At first, nothing happened. Then the metal gave way with a reluctant crack. The hinge groaned, as though it hadn’t been moved in years, and the door slowly swung open a narrow gap.

A rush of cold air brushed against her—dry and dusty, with a hint of metal.

She stepped through without giving herself time to reconsider, grabbed the edge, and pulled the door shut behind her. The bolt slid into place with a dry, hard slam.

Only then did she let go.

For a long moment, she just stood there, her back against the cold surface, head lowered, her forehead damp with sweat. She focused on her breathing.

Inhale.  
Exhale.

For a moment, everything seemed still.

Then she heard it.

At first, it was so faint she thought she was imagining it.

Right behind the door.

It came again—a sharp, probing scrape, as if something were dragging its fingernails impatiently across the steel.

There was something in that corridor.

The skin on her arms tightened.

What the hell was going on here?

Lara didn’t dare move. She stood so close to the door that she could feel the vibration; each new scrape sent a fine tremor through the metal—and straight into her spine.

1pswjia,https://www.reddit.com/r/scabies/comments/1pswjia/my_experience_after_contracting_scabies_3/,My experience after contracting scabies 3 seperate times in the past 2 years (*Single* M31),"Firstly, a bit of context. I was 29 when this first began, I have been single throughout the entirety of this episode and, as a single male in his late twenties (now 31) I have been happily dating in London. I was unlucky enough to contract scabies on a first date which led to a one night stand back in February 2024. Since then I have contracted it 3 further times from dating in London and have successfully treated all times. I wanted to write this post as a bit of a reminder that there is a *huge* amount of misinformation on Reddit and the majority of people who contract it never visit this sub, treat and move on happily with their lives. I will also caveat I'm not a medical professional but I have been through enough (in my opinion) to share my experience with this sub. I will first discuss the times that I contracted scabies before following up with my experience with treatment, cleaning and post. You can easily treat it with OTC medication in the UK, you just have to be patient and trust the process, more to follow.



**1****^(st)** **Episode**

I first contracted scabies in February 2024. I was unaware what it was so tried to ignore it for a following 3 months. I also contracted Covid which developed into Long Covid at the same time which led to me experiencing a much worse bout of scabies due to my compromised immune system. During this time I developed allergic reactions to any foods high in histamine as well as panic attacks (most likely brought on by the allergic reactions) and post exceptional malaise. I could barely eat, exercise and working was an utter slog. It was truly an awful time as I was completely unaware what was happening to me. I guess my body was being attacked by Covid in the gut and scabies on my skin so was in fight or flight mode continually for a matter of months. I was misdiagnosed twice by doctors who presumed the allergies were due to Long Covid and insisted it would pass over time. By April I had done enough of my own research to come to the conclusion that I must have scabies, I changed doctors and made an appointment in early April and they confirmed that I did in-fact have scabies. I was prescribed 2 tubes of Permethrin. However, during this time there was actually a shortage in the UK so the prescription never came through. Instead I just went to my local Boots and bought a few tubes. I notified my flatmate who also treated and after the first treatment, I decided to go and stay with my parents (out of London) to continue treatment and leave my room to kill any remaining bugs. During this treatment phase, I ended up treating 5 further times in the following weeks, which I now know is a massive mistake. I continued to have burrows, bumps and marks appearing for weeks after treatment and, every time this happened I would treat again. This continued until the end of June when my skin finally started feeling normal again.



**2****^(nd)** **Episode**

By October 2024 I had been happily dating and enjoying life. I met a girl in late October, which soon turned into something more serious. However, after a month, I realised scabies symptoms to reappear. After a week or so to see if it was just a post flare up (more on this later) we spoke and agreed that we both must have it due to her noticing small bumps appearing all over her body. For clarity, she had never had scabies before and her symptoms were much less than mine initially, my symptoms re-appeared much quicker which confirmed to me that we had it. We therefore both treated as per the advice with Lyclear, we decided to still hang out after the 1^(st) treatment which I know is not the best practise to put it lightly. We considered the risk to be low after a thorough washing, cleaning and treatment cycle in our respective flats. As well as knowing we would have to apply the 2^(nd) treatment in under a week and repeat the cycle. I also notified my flatmate again of the situation and she re-treated again even though she had no symptoms. Luckily, we went on with our lives as usual and the post symptoms slowly faded away, sadly for her, post symptoms were pretty horrific. She suggested re-treating many times, I suggested we be patient and see if the symptoms persist which they didn't and meant we didn't get locked into a cycle of over treatment and worsening skin symptoms.



**3****^(rd)** **Episode**

This is the 3^(rd) and last time I managed to contract scabies. I had stopped dating my partner in the 2^(nd) episode in early January 2025 and had been happily dating throughout winter and into spring. In July I met a new girl, after around a month of dating she started to speak of itchy Symptoms. I obviously freaked out. I was having a bit of a flare up at the same time so was pretty sure I contracted it again from a date I had been on weeks prior to meeting this new girl. We both treated, and by this point had decided to be friends as the magic had somewhat gone, due to the circumstances. We kept in touch and were both symptom free again by August. I once again told my flatmate and she also re-treated to be careful. She continued to have 0 symptoms.

I have tried to explain this series of events in the most concise way possible, I chose to avoid details of symptoms and my experience with post as I will now divulge my experiences with the cleaning, treatment and post cycle as well as reappearing symptoms for people who have had it more than once. I will once again caveat that this is my experience, it may not be the same for you and I am by no means a medical professional. This is lead by my experience and my own opinions.

The biggest battle with scabies is a mental one. If you aim to stay calm, collected and simply follow the treatment and clean adequately, you'll be clear in no time.

Throughout the entirety of this time, having had scabies 3 separate times, my flatmate never got it once from me. We shared hand towels, tea towels and bathmats when I had an active infestation and was unaware and she never once contracted it. We rarely cohabit the same spaces so that wasn't an issue, but the likelihood of catching it without sharing bedding, towels or having sex with someone with an active infestation is incredibly low. I see a lot of misinformation on how easy it is to catch it, 99% of the time it will be from skin to skin contact.



**My Treatment Experiences**

During my 1^(st) episode, I spent half my time on Reddit, doom scrolling with ways on how to eradicate scabies. I was so sure the treatment wasn't working due to my post symptoms. I took bad advice from subs which consisted of re-treating, having showers with sulphur soap and scrubbing my skin with an exfoliating glove. This only made my symptoms worse and prolonged my recovery.

I cleaned all bedding, clothes that I had worn, shared hand towels, tea towels and bath mats on a hot wash (50 Degrees) and air dried. Any coats that couldn't be washed I bagged up for 3 days along with trainers and slippers. If you can tumble dry, even better but don't stress, this simple way of cleaning works just fine. If you consider that the mite like to burrow into your skin, the likelihood of it existing on anything other than bedding and your underwear is pretty low. I also hoovered the floors and mopped for my own piece of mind.

I see some people posting insane cleaning rituals on here. It's a tiny mite thats entire purpose is to exist on your body, it has no business living on the walls, floors or ceilings of your flat. I've never replaced my mattress, luckily I have an Emma so the cover can be removed and washed before being put back on. I am sure adequate cleaning of bed sheets is sufficient to remove an infestation.



**Post**

These symptoms will most likely be worse than when you have an active infestation. Be aware that you may have post symptoms for months after treatment, I believe that once you've had it, your body can show symptoms even if you don't have it. This is paramount that you only treat as per the instructions and wait for at least a month before re-treating. Often you may have a new bump or burrow appear and this doesn't mean you have contracted it again, if your symptoms are generally getting better then I would argue this is just a delayed immune response and not a re-infestation. If you're unsure, seek medical advice before asking Reddit. Nodular scabies can last for a really long time which is frustrating but not uncommon. Patience and time are the best medicine. Flare ups can often happen and last for weeks at a time, don't treat unless you are certain to have come in to contact with someone with scabies as it can only exacerbate your problems.

I often have small flare ups on my hands whenever my immune system is compromised. For example, during extended training blocks (I'm a runner), when I'm sick or when I'm sleep deprived and/or stressed. With adequate lifestyle choices these flare ups go down quite quickly.

Keeping showers on the cooler side will avoid irritating your skin, use a Hypoallergenic soap such as Sanex 0% and moisturise with Aveeno/Cocoa Butter. Your skin will thank you. Boots in the UK also do a tea tree body spray for spots which is super nice and soothing if you want a quick fix for an itchy part of your body! I've seen Tea Tree being suggested as part of the treatment to kill the mite, I'm unsure if this is proven, people most likely find it helps relive the symptoms of post and therefore think it's killing the mite which has already been eradicated.

Take antihistamines. I found I was much more sensitive to dust since having scabies so I usually take Piriteze any time I get a flare up and they help massively!



**Overall Immune Health**

I feel like this is never discussed, but, being living an overall healthy lifestyle will aid in getting rid of scabies, the stronger your immune system the less likely your infestation is to worsen. My symptoms were so much worse when my immune system was compromised due to Covid. I also found avoiding foods with high amounts of Histamine to help relieve symptoms when I was in the worst part of my symptoms. I wouldn't advise a low-Histamine diet for long periods, but it definitely aided my recovery when I was having severe allergic reactions due to Long Covid & Scabies. For example, are you post symptoms worse after that morning coffee?

[https://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/the-food-list/](https://www.histamineintolerance.org.uk/about/the-food-diary/the-food-list/)

A healthy lifestyle also promotes healthy thinking and as I mentioned before, it's a mental battle more than anything.

\-

**Conclusion**

Scabies is an awful, awful thing, but it's not untreatable. It's made me borderline neurotic and it took me a long time to get on top of it. It's not easy but you will come out the other side and feel stronger as a person. Do the treatment, get off Reddit and live your life. It won't kill you.

Feel free to DM me for any further questions and I'll do my best to respond.

  
Big love to anyone who's been affected by this!
