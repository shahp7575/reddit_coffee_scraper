1mej4rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mej4rm/aitah_for_getting_mad_at_my_girlfriend_for/,AITAH for getting mad at my girlfriend for cheating on me with a guy who was stalking her?,"3 years ago I met my ex GF at a flower shop that she owned in NYC, we hit it off after a couple dates and started dating, we'll call her V,  V lived in a studio apartment close to a tennis court and we loved to go at least twice a week. One day me and V were playing like usual, when a guy was passing by and noticed us playing...or I should say, was noticing V playing, we'll call him B. V and I went home after an hour or two and had some friends over for a book reading. Fast forward to the next day, I stayed the night with V and left V's apartment to go back to my place, V got a knock on the door soon after I left, and who was it? That's right it was B. They started talking and eventually V let B in for coffee. they talked for a long time and eventually gave B her number. She did tell me about B that night and I asked ""Why did you give him your number?"" She said that he wanted to talk to her sometime about some labor representation issue he was going through, but I....was a little skeptical, I asked how B knew her, she said ""Oh he saw us playing tennis."" with the biggest, unscathed smile. I looked at her with my mouth slightly gape. ""So he stalked you, found out what apartment you live in, TOLD you he did exactly that...and you don't care!?"" she backtracked and backed him up saying that B and her would never be more than friends. After that I left it alone, still skeptical but keeping it to myself. for the next few weeks V and B started hanging out more, either it was at her apartment or out in public, eventually she was hanging out with him more than me. I kept mentioning that I wasn't comfortable with it but she dismissed me saying ""We're just friends"" and It all came crashing down a month later. I had stayed the night again with V and left for work in a rush that morning, I had to stay late at work that following night, I tried to call V to tell her but my phone died and I left my charger at her apartment. I finally came home around 9:00 and walked in, I immediently turn and see V at the dinner table, and on the other side of the table is B eating dinner with her. As soon as V looks at me she gets nervous ""oh I didn't know you were coming hun"" Ill admit, I was so exhausted that my rage was slowly brewing so I ignored what she said and explained my situation with work, she quickly got up and said ""Oh well I didn't want dinner to go to waste so I called B over"" I thought to myself ""Why would you make dinner if you thought I wasn't coming?"" but I immediently knew the answer, she quickly got up and sped walked to the kitchen to make me a plate and I sat in her spot and I finally got a good look at B. He was shorter than me, with a clean looking face, and a short slick back haircut. I looked at him with slightly narrow, exhausted eyes, and he started looking at me with the smuggest face, and something in me finally snapped. I lunged over and started throwing haymakers at him, now I don't know if this guy was a karate master because he was dodging all my throws. eventually V came running in and pulled me away, and she started berating ME! saying how he was so nice and caring to her and said that me and her were over. I stormed out and never saw her again. so tell me reddit, AITAH?

So the manager, front desk, and myself are having a casual conversation when a guest approaches us screaming, and demanding a discount on his stay. We look at each other thinking something major happened to his room, or an employee did something to offend him. Nope, his complaint was that an employee was getting coffee earlier from our free beverage area. This was after breakfast, and not a single soul was around. To make matters worse, this entitled ASSHOLE wasn‚Äôt even getting coffee himself, and made a huge issue saying the employee had the nerve to ‚Äúlook at him‚Äù while he walked by üôÑ

At first we thought there was more to the story, but no he just thought it was highly inappropriate that an employee would get coffee, and have the nerve to look at him. This guest didn‚Äôt just complain, but went full APE SHIT casing a scene in the lobby

Of course, we didn‚Äôt give him a discount, but believe it or not he called corporate, ( Milton) and got enough points for a fee stay in the future.

Waking up at 3pm, eating junk food in bed, doom scrolling until 5am. My room looked like a tornado hit it. I was basically a human sloth surviving on study loans while ignoring my classes completely. This went on for months until I realized I had to change my life or I'd be stuck forever.

TLDR: Start reading non-fiction daily and apply what you learn. Build the habit on willpower, not motivation. Use modern tools to make reading addictive. Your brain will literally rewire itself.

# HABIT BUILDING

The game changer for me was reading ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Clear breaks down the science of why we fail and gives you a bulletproof system that actually works.

The biggest mistake I made at first was relying on motivation. I'd get hyped up, promise myself I'd read for 2 hours daily, then crash and burn after 3 days. Motivation is like weather, it comes and goes. You can't build your life on something that unstable.

The solution is willpower plus stupidly small requirements. Instead of ""I'll read 50 pages because I'm motivated,"" say ""I'll force myself to read 1 page because I have enough willpower for that."" Make it so small you can't fail.

Here's the psychology behind why this works. Once you sit down with the book and read that one page, you'll usually keep going. Your brain doesn't want to stop once it's started. But if you set a huge goal and feel overwhelmed, you won't even start.

Try it right now. Go grab any book and read one page. I guarantee you have the willpower for that.

# READING

This is where the magic happened for me. Reading non-fiction daily was the one habit that changed everything else. I got an e-reader and started carrying it everywhere. Public transport, waiting in lines, before bed, it became my default activity.

The benefits hit different when you experience them yourself. You're learning directly from the smartest people who ever lived. Einstein, Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, they're all waiting on your bookshelf. There are books on literally anything you find interesting.

But here's what most people don't realize about reading. It rewires your brain. When you read, you create new neural pathways. You're upgrading your mental operating system every single day. After six months of consistent reading, I feel like I have access to hundreds of brilliant minds.

Books that completely changed my perspective: ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist who breaks down the science of self-control), ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the psychology of optimal experience), and ""Meet Your Happy Chemicals"" by Loretta Breuning (how your brain chemicals actually work).

I've tried everything to make reading more accessible and addictive. Physical books are great but since I got my new job in banking I seldom have time to read full books. My friend put me onto a smart reading app called BeFreed that turns books into engaging and personalized podcasts. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host‚Äôs voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha). It also builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I‚Äôd be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I‚Äôve replaced TikTok with knowledge. Essential sources for any lifelong learner.¬†

I also use Fable to track my reading, discover new books, and stay motivated through the community. For me, the goal is to remove every barrier to consuming knowledge.

The compound effect is insane. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Concepts from one book connect to ideas in another. You start seeing patterns everywhere. Your conversations get deeper. Your problem-solving improves. Friends notice you're giving better advice.

# DOPAMINE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY

This part blew my mind when I learned about it. Most people think dopamine equals pleasure, but that's wrong. Dopamine is actually about wanting and motivation. It's what drives you to seek rewards.

Here's the problem. Social media, Netflix, junk food, they all give massive dopamine hits. Way more than anything in nature ever would. Your brain gets addicted to these super-stimuli. When you're constantly getting these artificial highs, normal activities feel boring.

Reading trains your brain to focus on one thing for extended periods. It's like meditation but you're also gaining knowledge. You're teaching your dopamine system to find satisfaction in learning and growth instead of mindless consumption.

After a few weeks of consistent reading, I noticed my attention span improving. I could focus longer on tasks. The constant need to check my phone decreased. Reading became my replacement for doom scrolling.

# FLOW STATES

One book that changed how I think about activities is ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is when you're completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time. You forget about yourself. You're just present with the task.

Reading creates natural flow states. When you're deep in a good book, hours feel like minutes. This is your brain operating at peak performance. You're not distracted or scattered. You're fully engaged.

The difference between pleasure and enjoyment hit me hard. Pleasure activities give you dopamine but don't make you grow. Scrolling TikTok is pleasurable but empty. Reading is enjoyable because it challenges you and makes you better.

I started filling my days with more flow activities. Reading, learning guitar, having deep conversations. These activities are harder than passive entertainment but infinitely more rewarding.

# PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Start tonight with one page. Any book that interests you. Self-help, fiction, biography, doesn't matter. The goal is building the habit first.

Keep a book or e-reader visible somewhere you'll see it daily. I put mine next to my coffee maker so I'd see it every morning.

Replace one mindless activity with reading. Instead of scrolling while you eat breakfast, read. Instead of watching random YouTube videos before bed, read.

Track your progress somehow. I use a simple habit tracker app. Seeing the streak build up becomes addictive.

Join online communities about reading. Reddit has amazing book communities. Goodreads helps you discover new books and track what you've read.

The crazy part is that six months ago, I thought people who read regularly were just naturally disciplined. Now I realize discipline is just a habit you build one page at a time. Reading taught me that I'm not broken or lazy. I just needed better systems and knowledge about how my brain actually works.

Anyone can do this. You don't need special talent or motivation. You just need to start ridiculously small and be consistent. Your future self will thank you for starting today.",1,1754010482.0,LifeAdvice,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôve lived in this studio for 5 years and it just feels stagnant. I‚Äôm ready for a change, but I can‚Äôt see anything fitting anywhere else. I do have a portable ac on the floor that needs to be in either the window by the front door or the window next to where my bed currently is.

I (20M) have a crush on my coworker (Puja 25F). We used to talk sometimes, she smiled at me, and even offered food once. But now her behavior is confusing.

Some days she seems to avoid me completely. Other times, when I smile at her or look at her, she talks nicely or asks something. But if I don‚Äôt show interest, she also ignores me.

Once I offered her a lift, she didn‚Äôt respond at all. Recently, she went for a coffee break with others but didn‚Äôt invite me, even though I was sitting nearby. That hurt.

One day I was very upset at work. Everyone came to support me, but she didn‚Äôt say anything, even though she was nearby and heard everything.

She watches Instagram reels about feelings and overthinking, so I wonder if she‚Äôs confused like me. Or maybe I‚Äôm imagining too much.

What do you think? Is it mixed signals or is she just not into me?

Disclaimer : Lengthy Post. Definately Helpful.

Is it Possible To Manifest SP against ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ?? 3P situation..No Contact for Years. Living in Different Countries.. SP told You they don't love you or whatever. 

My answer is YES. 
IT'S üíØ POSSIBLE TO MANIFEST SP Mo matter what You are facing or seeing in your reality. 

I myself Manifested my SP against all circumstances. Against all odds. Not even single situation or circumstance was in my favour. Still I Manifested my SP. 

Question is How I did it ?

It's simple to answer but quite difficult to understand n implement.

Soo here is my story and Guidance to get Your SP. 

Here is the Complete Story. ( Going to be lengthy but it ll help you to understand the complete journey ) 

I had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend in 2019.
I was shattered, but then I decided that I would attract a girl who was more beautiful and more loving than my ex.
I was very specific about the kind of partner I wanted.
I wrote down every detail I desired in my future partner her looks, aesthetics, behavior, nature, skin color, name, height, physique  everything.

Then I performed an imaginal act, as if I had already found my ideal partner. After that, I let it go; I didn‚Äôt obsess over it.
I did this exercise just for fun in March 2019. I still remember it clearly.

A few weeks later, I saw a girl from a distance, and I felt like she was the one.
Then I prayed to God, saying, ‚ÄúPlease, I want to know her. Do something  I just want to meet her once.‚Äù

I forgot about her and the prayers I had made in that moment.
A few weeks later, I received a follow request on Instagram from a girl. When I checked her profile, I realized she was the exact same girl I had seen a few weeks ago.

She even messaged me, saying, ‚ÄúDo we really know each other?‚Äù
I was like, Damn!
Then we started talking. Slowly, I began to realize that she was the exact same girl I had imagined during that fun exercise  the same aesthetics, the same height, the same traits. It felt like I had crafted her out of a raw mold.

But as we continued talking, it became clear that it was a one-way conversation. She wasn‚Äôt responding the way I had hoped  her replies were cold and distant.
Eventually, I found out that she had been in a relationship with a guy for the past 5‚Äì6 years.

Then I had a desire to meet her.
We met twice, just for an hour each time, over coffee. The conversations were normal and casual.

But for me, it was a win  almost like a miracle. I had wanted to meet her, and I did. That experience gave me a boost and confidence that there‚Äôs something magical about these higher forces.

The very next day, she moved to a different city.
After that, she got busy with her life, and we barely spoke over text.

That‚Äôs when I started exploring the Law of Attraction.
(I didn‚Äôt know about the Law of Assumption or Neville Goddard‚Äôs teachings on manifestation back in 2019.)
The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you in the present moment. Feel it as real, and feel good  just for the sake of the experience.‚Äù 

That was the only thing I knew about the Law of Attraction.
(I wasn‚Äôt aware of third-party situations, no-contact phases, self-concept, affirmations, or the SAT technique.)

The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you now, and feel as if it‚Äôs real.‚Äù

So, whenever I had a desire to talk to her or be with her, I would imagine having a loving conversation with her.
If I was sitting at a coffee shop and missing her, I would simply imagine her sitting next to me, holding my hand and loving me.
If I was having dinner, I‚Äôd imagine she was the one who cooked it and was feeding me with love.
If I was working out at the gym, I would imagine her helping me with the workout, taking gym pictures with me, as if we were doing it all together.

So basically, I just wanted to feel good as if she was with me now. I focused on my imagination and treated it as if it were real.

I was internally living in my imagination  as if we were already dating and in a loving relationship.

Now, the most important part: how did I ignore the third-party situation, the no-contact phase, and the fact that she was in a different city?

To be honest, it never really bothered me  because my ultimate goal was to feel good in the present moment. I chose to ignore everything else, as if it didn‚Äôt matter.

Third-party situation? I knew that couples break up eventually  it‚Äôs a very normal thing. I had gone through a breakup myself after a 4‚Äì5 year relationship, so I understood how common it is.
I didn‚Äôt focus on her boyfriend at all. I simply enjoyed the imagined scenes where she was my girlfriend, and I was her boyfriend  the best thing that ever happened to her. And she loved me deeply.

Period.

I did this exercise for a few months until around September or October 2019.
After that, she moved to her hometown with her boyfriend (a live-in relationship situation).
Then the pandemic happened.

To be honest, I lost hope. I was tired of doing the imagination scenes  my mind felt saturated with the idea that I already had my girlfriend. So I reached a point where I didn‚Äôt feel like doing any more imagination techniques. I was done.
(Neville Goddard calls this the Sabbath state  the state of wish fulfilled.)

I got busy with my own life. I deleted all my social media. I even deleted her contact.
Why? Because I had lost all hope and wasn‚Äôt expecting anything to happen.
I wasn‚Äôt expecting any outcome at all, simply because I didn‚Äôt know if these things actually worked or manifested in real life.

All I had wanted was to feel good  and I did.
Then, I let everything go.

After some time, I completely forgot about her. She was living her life, and I was living mine.

One and a half years later 

It was October 2021.
Out of nowhere, I received a call from an unknown number.
Guess what? It was the same girl.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve moved back to your city  let‚Äôs meet.‚Äù

I was like, Holy f**... she still has my number?*
She literally called me after a year and a half?

At first, I thought maybe she had just moved back for work or something.
Then we started meeting more often.
And after some time, she proposed to me  and we started dating.

During this time, everything began to unfold exactly as I had imagined back in 2019.
The moment she pulled me in and kissed me, I realized  I had imagined this exact scene before.
Her waking up next to me... holding hands... walking down the street on a cold winter night, cuddling under a blanket... cooking dinner for me... washing my clothes...

I was like, Wait a second. Is this really happening?
It felt surreal as if I had already lived this in my imagination, and now I was experiencing it in physical reality.

Not gonna lie every single thing I had once imagined was replicated exactly as it was.

That‚Äôs when I truly started believing in the Law of Attraction.
I began studying it more deeply, and eventually, I came across the Law of Assumption.

Then I realized I had actually been practicing the Law of Assumption all along.
Telling myself: ‚ÄúShe is my girlfriend. We are in a relationship. We are living together.‚Äù

Imagination was just the technique  the tool I used to assume my desired reality.

We all wonder what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes, especially when we don‚Äôt see any movement in the physical reality.
Instead, we often see the opposite of what we desire.

We see our SP (specific person) with a 3P (third party).
We see them going on trips, romantic dates, and sharing happy moments.
Right?

And then we start questioning:
""How is it even possible to manifest? I‚Äôm seeing no movement. I can literally see my SP with someone else. They look happy. My SP is in a different city. We haven‚Äôt spoken in months.""

All those negative thoughts start creeping in.

So, I started digging deeper.
Out of curiosity, I began asking her questions  I wanted to understand what actually happened during those two years we were apart behind the scenes.

I asked,
‚ÄúHow was your relationship during those two years of the pandemic, when you were living together?‚Äù
(Why did I ask that? Because I had assumed they must have been happy together  enjoying a romantic, loving time.)

But her response shocked me.

She said,
‚ÄúWe were just living under the same roof. My boyfriend was always occupied with work. He hardly had time for me. I was depressed. We used to fight almost every day. We only went out a few times just to feel better, but we were constantly arguing. And honestly, we had zero physical intimacy during those two years. I was just eating, feeling low, watching YouTube and Netflix, and sleeping.‚Äù

Then I asked her,
‚ÄúDid you ever think about me during that time?‚Äù

She replied,
‚ÄúYes, I used to think that whenever I visited my hometown, I‚Äôd want to meet you again.‚Äù

I asked her,
‚ÄúWhy did you move to Pune?‚Äù

She said,
‚ÄúActually, I had been planning to move to Mumbai for two years for my career  not Pune. But suddenly, at the last moment, I changed my mind and decided to move to Pune instead.‚Äù

Then she told me that when she moved to Pune, she contacted almost everyone  except me.
She confessed that she had bad experiences with the guys she met after moving to Pune.
These were guys who had been in constant contact with her for the past two years  texting and calling her every day.
On the other hand, I was in a complete no-contact situation.

Then, one night around 4 AM, she suddenly called me and asked to meet as soon as possible.
We met around 7 AM that same morning.

I was thinking, Why is she calling me out of nowhere after two years  and at such an odd time?

After that, we started meeting more often and spending time together.
She began to enjoy my company, grew fond of me, and eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

So, what‚Äôs the learning from this experience?

I‚Äôve completed my journey  from zero contact to being in a relationship.

The biggest lesson: Movement is always happening behind the scenes even if we can‚Äôt see it.
We often try to look for signs of movement by checking Instagram stories, social media accounts, following lists, their status with the third party, their pictures together, etc.
We see these things and instantly give them negative meaning:
""Oh, this isn‚Äôt working.""
""They look so happy together.""
""There‚Äôs no movement.""

But remember  what we see isn‚Äôt always the truth.
We never know what‚Äôs really happening behind the scenes.

When I looked back and connected all the dots, I realized everything was actually unfolding in my favor.
Every situation that seemed like a setback was secretly working for me.

The pandemic happened.
She moved back to her hometown and started living with her boyfriend at first glance, that seemed like an unfavorable situation.
But in reality, it was working in my favor.

She even told me that during the time she lived with her boyfriend, she realized she couldn‚Äôt see a future with him  she couldn't marry him.

Other guys were constantly in contact with her for two years, some even proposed to her  but she rejected them all.
And eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

It was all a series of events  silently aligning in my favor.

How did she change her mind and move to my city when she originally wanted to move to a different one?

Because it was my imagination.
I had imagined us being together.
I didn‚Äôt ask her to come to my city.
She made that decision on her own  or at least, it appeared that way.
I didn‚Äôt influence her directly.
I simply imagined us being together, and somehow, she changed her mind  as if it were her own choice.

It‚Äôs that simple.
You don‚Äôt have to convince or influence another person to change their mind.
You don‚Äôt even have to lift a finger.
The Universe has infinite ways to fulfill your desire.

I wasn‚Äôt questioning how it would happen 
She already had a boyfriend‚Ä¶
She had already moved to a different city‚Ä¶
We weren‚Äôt even in touch regularly  no texting, no calling.

But none of that mattered.
The only thing that mattered was what I imagined, and what I assumed to be true.
The rest wasn‚Äôt my job  it was the Universe‚Äôs job to make it happen.

How and why did she break up with her boyfriend after 5‚Äì6 years of being in a relationship?

I never asked her to leave her boyfriend.
I never forced her or influenced her decision in any way.
All I did was imagine the two of us being in a loving relationship together.

Eventually, it was her boyfriend‚Äôs own behavior that led to the breakup.
I didn‚Äôt ask him to act a certain way or to fight with her it all happened naturally.

After spending two years living together under the same roof, she decided to leave him  after a 5‚Äì6 year-long relationship.

I didn‚Äôt do anything externally.
I simply imagined that she and I were together in a relationship.

The rest? A series of events unfolded on their own.
Everything happened behind the scenes 
Things you can‚Äôt see on social media, TikTok, or WhatsApp statuses.


Now, let‚Äôs talk about something that almost everyone in the manifestation community asks:

""How many times should I do affirmations?""
""How many times should I repeat the visualization scene?""
""Should I do the 369 or 555 technique?""

Here‚Äôs my honest experience:

I never did any affirmation routine.
I never repeated my imagination or visualization scene more than once.
I never did the 369 or 555 technique.

I was doing it purely as a fun activity.
Like  I‚Äôm in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd imagine my girlfriend banging on the door just to irritate me.
I‚Äôm taking a shower, and I imagine her wanting to join me  just for fun.
I‚Äôm washing clothes or cleaning my room, and I imagine her saying, ‚ÄúStop! I‚Äôll do it for you.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the key: Make manifestation a fun experience, not a burden.
You‚Äôre supposed to feel good after imagining  not anxious.


The Most Popular Question in the Manifestation Community:

""When will it happen?""

The honest answer: NO ONE KNOWS.
And if you really want your manifestation to happen fast, stop focusing on time.

If you just imagined your SP right now  why are you trying to experience it again?
If I‚Äôm already in a relationship with my girlfriend in imagination, I don‚Äôt sit around wondering when it will happen  because I already feel like it‚Äôs real.

And when you live from that assumption, things manifest in the quickest way possible.

It requires patience.
If you keep checking your outer reality for signs, you‚Äôre actually delaying your manifestation.


My Tips (From Personal Experience):

Everything is possible.

Circumstances don‚Äôt matter  no matter how bad things seem.

Your SP loves you and wants you just as much as you want them.

3P (third party) is irrelevant. Ignore them.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is changeable as per your desire.

Your only job is to decide exactly what you want  and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

The ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù are not your job  that‚Äôs the Universe‚Äôs job.

Don‚Äôt get obsessed with techniques or what coaches say. It‚Äôs not necessary to affirm every day or visualize every night.
Do it because it‚Äôs fun, not because you‚Äôre desperate.

You are more important than your SP.

What Does It Feel Like to Finally Get Your SP?

My experience?

At first, I thought my SP was out of my league.
She‚Äôs a professional model, very beautiful.
I thought it would be a miracle just to meet her.
I believed it would be magical if she ever kissed me.
I felt I would be lucky if I ever got to date her.

That was my mindset during the manifestation phase.

But when we actually started dating?

She turned out to be just a normal person like me.
She literally said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky to have you.‚Äù
She kisses me almost every passing hour  my lips actually hurt now.
I get irritated sometimes because she‚Äôs so physically and emotionally obsessed with me.
She calls me every hour, texts me like crazy ‚Äî and I purposely ignore her texts and calls sometimes just to take a break.

Point is you just feel normal once it happens.
Your SP is just another human being like you.

So stop obsessing.
Stop thinking, ‚ÄúOh no! My SP blocked me, my life is over.‚Äù
That‚Äôs all noise. Let it go.

Manifesting your SP is the easiest thing on the planet.

Just assume you already have your SP. Smile.
The rest will be taken care of.

I hope this helps you.

I dropped a decaf americano on the floor after the first sip.,"After staring the day at 6am, finishing up packing my entire life up in a pod to move cross country, having a flight canceled 30 min before boarding, shuffling to find a pet friendly hotel for the night, and picking up some cat necessities at target, i sat down at a starbucks. I never go to starbucks. But i went to this starbucks and ordered a decaf americano. I was elated to recieve the black gold and upon taking one sip I was sent on a journey. Then my uber arrived to return to the hotel and as i sar up in ernest i knocked my drink on the floor. I watched in slow motion as the moment shattered the viel of happiness i felt only swcond prior. It hit the ground and spread. I wanted to cry but didn't i sadly told the lady who took my order and I said that I was sorry. While walking out to meet my uber on the ladies making coffee asked if thst giy jsut dropped his entire coffee and walked out. I didnt have the heart to respond and sadly waited outside as the sun beat down on me for the remaining 49 seconds before my uber pulled up. It sank in deeper and deeper as he drove. He asked why didnt you get another I could have waited. In my shame I said the moment has passed. i looked into thr sky aimlessly and he even asked if i wanted to stop to get another i said that it was ok and fate had betrayed me.

Okay, firstly... I'll absolutely admit that this may sound a bit odd at first, but hey, hear me out! 

Essentially, there's a lot weighing on me lately. I'm dealing with chronic and worsening health stuff, I'm feeling disconnected from the city and local social communities (health stuff makes it hard to go out), and with a project I'm working on at the moment? It is definitely an overwhelming, and intimidating task, and honestly even if it is a passion project, I wonder if I bit off more than I could chew.

With all of this (and more) weighing on me... I'm sort of feeling this overwhelming urge to just be held, and squeezed. I mean, it is one of those things that has been known to bring comfort to many people who are on the autistic spectrum after all, including myself. And no, this isn't a ""hug"" like some people thought I meant on my last posts. To be honest, it doesn't even have to involve physical contact. I mean, just having me wrapped up in a blanket burrito, and being squeezed from the outside of the burrito would be much closer to what I'm hoping for out of this. 

Of course I'd absolutely love to cook you some food! We could watch a show, listen to music, talk (or not), and of course we could do the squeeze whenever you felt comfortable! The squeeze would ideally last for a few minutes, but that can be discussed. I just think it should be long enough that i can actually allow myself to relax into it. Ideally, we should talk online, and meet for a coffee first since something like this requires at least a bit of established trust. 

Honestly, I don't even know if posting this will yield anything. I'm nervous about even being this vulnerable with expressing a need like this. But hey, I've met some fabulous people on reddit before... so honestly? Why not?

If you are open to this concept, feel free to reach out! I'd love to talk, and see what we can do from there! If you'd benefit from a good squeeze too, I can do the same for you!

A bit about me! I'm 26, non binary, living in Coquitlam (but can travel anywhere!). I'm neurodivergent (obviously), and have interests that range from music, art, and creativity, to transit, and horror! I love going out into nature sometimes, but I also enjoy staying in, and gaming too. I'm also trying to get into alternative fashion more!

For something like this, I probably would prefer to connect with other LGBTQ+ folks, and neurodivergent folks too. I do tend to be picky about the cis men I connect with, but I'm not opposed. Just please approach me with a message that actually shows you read this post, and DO NOT bring up, or even imply anything that is NSFW, otherwise I will block you! This act is meant to be platonic in nature. 

Anyways! I look forward to hearing from some people!

Also, to help show me you've read this post, please tell me your favourite types of music! ",1,1754009773.0,r4r,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best 8 oz cups with lids offer a blend of functionality,durability,and environmental friendliness. These factors contribute to both the user experience and the overall value of the product.

**Material Composition:** The material used in an 8 oz cup dramatically affects its performance. Polypropylene (PP) plastic is a common choice due to its durability and recyclability; however, it is not ideal for very hot liquids. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic offers superior clarity but is less heat-resistant. Bio-based plastics, such as PLA (Polylactic Acid), are derived from renewable sources like cornstarch, making them an eco-friendlier option, though typically more costly. Paper cups with polyethylene linings present a compostable option, but may lack the same level of leak protection.the ideal material depends on the intended use and the importance of sustainability.

**Lid Design and seal:** A well-designed lid is critical to preventing spills and maintaining the temperature of the contents. Snap-on lids provide a secure closure, while screw-on lids offer an even tighter seal, minimizing leakage. Some lids feature sipping holes that can be sealed with stoppers, giving users more control. The best lids create a tight, airtight seal that prevents spills, even when the cup is jostled. Consider options with double seals or raised edges for superior spill protection.

**Insulation Properties:** For hot beverages, insulation is crucial. Double-walled cups provide enhanced insulation, keeping drinks hot for longer and preventing heat transfer to the user's hand. Some cups feature an additional layer of insulation,such as a corrugated sleeve,for added comfort and temperature retention.For cold beverages, insulated cups prevent condensation and help keep the drink cold for an extended time. Look for vacuum-insulated options for lasting temperature control,especially if storing hot or cold drinks for long periods of time.

**Stackability:** Efficient storage is frequently enough a necessity, especially in high-volume environments such as coffee shops or catering services. Cups designed for stackability nest neatly together, minimizing storage space and making it easier to grab a cup when needed. Stackable cups have a tapered design that allows them to fit securely inside one another without sticking or jamming. This feature is essential if you frequently use large quantities of cups.

**Durability and Reusability:** While many 8 oz cups are designed for single-use, some are durable enough to be reused multiple times. Cups made from thicker plastics or stainless steel can withstand repeated washings and resist cracking or breaking. Reusable cups are a more lasting alternative to disposable cups, reducing waste and saving money in the long run. Look for cups that are dishwasher-safe for added convenience.**Compatibility:** Some cups might potentially be specific to certain dispensers or machines which can enhance efficiency, especially for business purposes. Check the diameter of the cup against these machines. Some lids may also be worldwide and fit a range of cups which, again, can be helpful with streamlining operations.

Key features of the best 8 oz cups with lids include:

* Materials such as Polypropylene (PP) or Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic.
* Secure lid design, such as snap-on or screw-on.* Double-walled construction for added insulation.
* Stackable design for efficient storage.
* Durable and reusable.
* Compatibility with dispensers or machines.

1meirzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/analoghorror/comments/1meirzh/full_bad_mouse_concept/,Full Bad Mouse concept,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:

‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô

‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù

‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù

‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù

‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù

‚Äúbad mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm going to show you the world‚Äù

‚Äúbad mouse is getting worse!‚Äù

‚Äúme me me me me me‚Äù

‚Äúattention‚Äù

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

All we know is that a disturbed and depraved mind exists somewhere in the world, and for that, the world is an ever scarier and darker place.

Disclaimer : Lengthy Post. Definately Helpful.

Is it Possible To Manifest SP against ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ?? 3P situation..No Contact for Years. Living in Different Countries.. SP told You they don't love you or whatever. 

My answer is YES. 
IT'S üíØ POSSIBLE TO MANIFEST SP Mo matter what You are facing or seeing in your reality. 

I myself Manifested my SP against all circumstances. Against all odds. Not even single situation or circumstance was in my favour. Still I Manifested my SP. 

Question is How I did it ?

It's simple to answer but quite difficult to understand n implement.

Soo here is my story and Guidance to get Your SP. 

Here is the Complete Story. ( Going to be lengthy but it ll help you to understand the complete journey ) 

I had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend in 2019.
I was shattered, but then I decided that I would attract a girl who was more beautiful and more loving than my ex.
I was very specific about the kind of partner I wanted.
I wrote down every detail I desired in my future partner her looks, aesthetics, behavior, nature, skin color, name, height, physique  everything.

Then I performed an imaginal act, as if I had already found my ideal partner. After that, I let it go; I didn‚Äôt obsess over it.
I did this exercise just for fun in March 2019. I still remember it clearly.

A few weeks later, I saw a girl from a distance, and I felt like she was the one.
Then I prayed to God, saying, ‚ÄúPlease, I want to know her. Do something  I just want to meet her once.‚Äù

I forgot about her and the prayers I had made in that moment.
A few weeks later, I received a follow request on Instagram from a girl. When I checked her profile, I realized she was the exact same girl I had seen a few weeks ago.

She even messaged me, saying, ‚ÄúDo we really know each other?‚Äù
I was like, Damn!
Then we started talking. Slowly, I began to realize that she was the exact same girl I had imagined during that fun exercise  the same aesthetics, the same height, the same traits. It felt like I had crafted her out of a raw mold.

But as we continued talking, it became clear that it was a one-way conversation. She wasn‚Äôt responding the way I had hoped  her replies were cold and distant.
Eventually, I found out that she had been in a relationship with a guy for the past 5‚Äì6 years.

Then I had a desire to meet her.
We met twice, just for an hour each time, over coffee. The conversations were normal and casual.

But for me, it was a win  almost like a miracle. I had wanted to meet her, and I did. That experience gave me a boost and confidence that there‚Äôs something magical about these higher forces.

The very next day, she moved to a different city.
After that, she got busy with her life, and we barely spoke over text.

That‚Äôs when I started exploring the Law of Attraction.
(I didn‚Äôt know about the Law of Assumption or Neville Goddard‚Äôs teachings on manifestation back in 2019.)
The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you in the present moment. Feel it as real, and feel good  just for the sake of the experience.‚Äù 

That was the only thing I knew about the Law of Attraction.
(I wasn‚Äôt aware of third-party situations, no-contact phases, self-concept, affirmations, or the SAT technique.)

The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you now, and feel as if it‚Äôs real.‚Äù

So, whenever I had a desire to talk to her or be with her, I would imagine having a loving conversation with her.
If I was sitting at a coffee shop and missing her, I would simply imagine her sitting next to me, holding my hand and loving me.
If I was having dinner, I‚Äôd imagine she was the one who cooked it and was feeding me with love.
If I was working out at the gym, I would imagine her helping me with the workout, taking gym pictures with me, as if we were doing it all together.

So basically, I just wanted to feel good as if she was with me now. I focused on my imagination and treated it as if it were real.

I was internally living in my imagination  as if we were already dating and in a loving relationship.

Now, the most important part: how did I ignore the third-party situation, the no-contact phase, and the fact that she was in a different city?

To be honest, it never really bothered me  because my ultimate goal was to feel good in the present moment. I chose to ignore everything else, as if it didn‚Äôt matter.

Third-party situation? I knew that couples break up eventually  it‚Äôs a very normal thing. I had gone through a breakup myself after a 4‚Äì5 year relationship, so I understood how common it is.
I didn‚Äôt focus on her boyfriend at all. I simply enjoyed the imagined scenes where she was my girlfriend, and I was her boyfriend  the best thing that ever happened to her. And she loved me deeply.

Period.

I did this exercise for a few months until around September or October 2019.
After that, she moved to her hometown with her boyfriend (a live-in relationship situation).
Then the pandemic happened.

To be honest, I lost hope. I was tired of doing the imagination scenes  my mind felt saturated with the idea that I already had my girlfriend. So I reached a point where I didn‚Äôt feel like doing any more imagination techniques. I was done.
(Neville Goddard calls this the Sabbath state  the state of wish fulfilled.)

I got busy with my own life. I deleted all my social media. I even deleted her contact.
Why? Because I had lost all hope and wasn‚Äôt expecting anything to happen.
I wasn‚Äôt expecting any outcome at all, simply because I didn‚Äôt know if these things actually worked or manifested in real life.

All I had wanted was to feel good  and I did.
Then, I let everything go.

After some time, I completely forgot about her. She was living her life, and I was living mine.

One and a half years later 

It was October 2021.
Out of nowhere, I received a call from an unknown number.
Guess what? It was the same girl.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve moved back to your city  let‚Äôs meet.‚Äù

I was like, Holy f**... she still has my number?*
She literally called me after a year and a half?

At first, I thought maybe she had just moved back for work or something.
Then we started meeting more often.
And after some time, she proposed to me  and we started dating.

During this time, everything began to unfold exactly as I had imagined back in 2019.
The moment she pulled me in and kissed me, I realized  I had imagined this exact scene before.
Her waking up next to me... holding hands... walking down the street on a cold winter night, cuddling under a blanket... cooking dinner for me... washing my clothes...

I was like, Wait a second. Is this really happening?
It felt surreal as if I had already lived this in my imagination, and now I was experiencing it in physical reality.

Not gonna lie every single thing I had once imagined was replicated exactly as it was.

That‚Äôs when I truly started believing in the Law of Attraction.
I began studying it more deeply, and eventually, I came across the Law of Assumption.

Then I realized I had actually been practicing the Law of Assumption all along.
Telling myself: ‚ÄúShe is my girlfriend. We are in a relationship. We are living together.‚Äù

Imagination was just the technique  the tool I used to assume my desired reality.

We all wonder what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes, especially when we don‚Äôt see any movement in the physical reality.
Instead, we often see the opposite of what we desire.

We see our SP (specific person) with a 3P (third party).
We see them going on trips, romantic dates, and sharing happy moments.
Right?

And then we start questioning:
""How is it even possible to manifest? I‚Äôm seeing no movement. I can literally see my SP with someone else. They look happy. My SP is in a different city. We haven‚Äôt spoken in months.""

All those negative thoughts start creeping in.

So, I started digging deeper.
Out of curiosity, I began asking her questions  I wanted to understand what actually happened during those two years we were apart behind the scenes.

I asked,
‚ÄúHow was your relationship during those two years of the pandemic, when you were living together?‚Äù
(Why did I ask that? Because I had assumed they must have been happy together  enjoying a romantic, loving time.)

But her response shocked me.

She said,
‚ÄúWe were just living under the same roof. My boyfriend was always occupied with work. He hardly had time for me. I was depressed. We used to fight almost every day. We only went out a few times just to feel better, but we were constantly arguing. And honestly, we had zero physical intimacy during those two years. I was just eating, feeling low, watching YouTube and Netflix, and sleeping.‚Äù

Then I asked her,
‚ÄúDid you ever think about me during that time?‚Äù

She replied,
‚ÄúYes, I used to think that whenever I visited my hometown, I‚Äôd want to meet you again.‚Äù

I asked her,
‚ÄúWhy did you move to Pune?‚Äù

She said,
‚ÄúActually, I had been planning to move to Mumbai for two years for my career  not Pune. But suddenly, at the last moment, I changed my mind and decided to move to Pune instead.‚Äù

Then she told me that when she moved to Pune, she contacted almost everyone  except me.
She confessed that she had bad experiences with the guys she met after moving to Pune.
These were guys who had been in constant contact with her for the past two years  texting and calling her every day.
On the other hand, I was in a complete no-contact situation.

Then, one night around 4 AM, she suddenly called me and asked to meet as soon as possible.
We met around 7 AM that same morning.

I was thinking, Why is she calling me out of nowhere after two years  and at such an odd time?

After that, we started meeting more often and spending time together.
She began to enjoy my company, grew fond of me, and eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

So, what‚Äôs the learning from this experience?

I‚Äôve completed my journey  from zero contact to being in a relationship.

The biggest lesson: Movement is always happening behind the scenes even if we can‚Äôt see it.
We often try to look for signs of movement by checking Instagram stories, social media accounts, following lists, their status with the third party, their pictures together, etc.
We see these things and instantly give them negative meaning:
""Oh, this isn‚Äôt working.""
""They look so happy together.""
""There‚Äôs no movement.""

But remember  what we see isn‚Äôt always the truth.
We never know what‚Äôs really happening behind the scenes.

When I looked back and connected all the dots, I realized everything was actually unfolding in my favor.
Every situation that seemed like a setback was secretly working for me.

The pandemic happened.
She moved back to her hometown and started living with her boyfriend at first glance, that seemed like an unfavorable situation.
But in reality, it was working in my favor.

She even told me that during the time she lived with her boyfriend, she realized she couldn‚Äôt see a future with him  she couldn't marry him.

Other guys were constantly in contact with her for two years, some even proposed to her  but she rejected them all.
And eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

It was all a series of events  silently aligning in my favor.

How did she change her mind and move to my city when she originally wanted to move to a different one?

Because it was my imagination.
I had imagined us being together.
I didn‚Äôt ask her to come to my city.
She made that decision on her own  or at least, it appeared that way.
I didn‚Äôt influence her directly.
I simply imagined us being together, and somehow, she changed her mind  as if it were her own choice.

It‚Äôs that simple.
You don‚Äôt have to convince or influence another person to change their mind.
You don‚Äôt even have to lift a finger.
The Universe has infinite ways to fulfill your desire.

I wasn‚Äôt questioning how it would happen 
She already had a boyfriend‚Ä¶
She had already moved to a different city‚Ä¶
We weren‚Äôt even in touch regularly  no texting, no calling.

But none of that mattered.
The only thing that mattered was what I imagined, and what I assumed to be true.
The rest wasn‚Äôt my job  it was the Universe‚Äôs job to make it happen.

How and why did she break up with her boyfriend after 5‚Äì6 years of being in a relationship?

I never asked her to leave her boyfriend.
I never forced her or influenced her decision in any way.
All I did was imagine the two of us being in a loving relationship together.

Eventually, it was her boyfriend‚Äôs own behavior that led to the breakup.
I didn‚Äôt ask him to act a certain way or to fight with her it all happened naturally.

After spending two years living together under the same roof, she decided to leave him  after a 5‚Äì6 year-long relationship.

I didn‚Äôt do anything externally.
I simply imagined that she and I were together in a relationship.

The rest? A series of events unfolded on their own.
Everything happened behind the scenes 
Things you can‚Äôt see on social media, TikTok, or WhatsApp statuses.


Now, let‚Äôs talk about something that almost everyone in the manifestation community asks:

""How many times should I do affirmations?""
""How many times should I repeat the visualization scene?""
""Should I do the 369 or 555 technique?""

Here‚Äôs my honest experience:

I never did any affirmation routine.
I never repeated my imagination or visualization scene more than once.
I never did the 369 or 555 technique.

I was doing it purely as a fun activity.
Like  I‚Äôm in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd imagine my girlfriend banging on the door just to irritate me.
I‚Äôm taking a shower, and I imagine her wanting to join me  just for fun.
I‚Äôm washing clothes or cleaning my room, and I imagine her saying, ‚ÄúStop! I‚Äôll do it for you.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the key: Make manifestation a fun experience, not a burden.
You‚Äôre supposed to feel good after imagining  not anxious.


The Most Popular Question in the Manifestation Community:

""When will it happen?""

The honest answer: NO ONE KNOWS.
And if you really want your manifestation to happen fast, stop focusing on time.

If you just imagined your SP right now  why are you trying to experience it again?
If I‚Äôm already in a relationship with my girlfriend in imagination, I don‚Äôt sit around wondering when it will happen  because I already feel like it‚Äôs real.

And when you live from that assumption, things manifest in the quickest way possible.

It requires patience.
If you keep checking your outer reality for signs, you‚Äôre actually delaying your manifestation.


My Tips (From Personal Experience):

Everything is possible.

Circumstances don‚Äôt matter  no matter how bad things seem.

Your SP loves you and wants you just as much as you want them.

3P (third party) is irrelevant. Ignore them.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is changeable as per your desire.

Your only job is to decide exactly what you want  and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

The ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù are not your job  that‚Äôs the Universe‚Äôs job.

Don‚Äôt get obsessed with techniques or what coaches say. It‚Äôs not necessary to affirm every day or visualize every night.
Do it because it‚Äôs fun, not because you‚Äôre desperate.

You are more important than your SP.

What Does It Feel Like to Finally Get Your SP?

My experience?

At first, I thought my SP was out of my league.
She‚Äôs a professional model, very beautiful.
I thought it would be a miracle just to meet her.
I believed it would be magical if she ever kissed me.
I felt I would be lucky if I ever got to date her.

That was my mindset during the manifestation phase.

But when we actually started dating?

She turned out to be just a normal person like me.
She literally said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky to have you.‚Äù
She kisses me almost every passing hour  my lips actually hurt now.
I get irritated sometimes because she‚Äôs so physically and emotionally obsessed with me.
She calls me every hour, texts me like crazy ‚Äî and I purposely ignore her texts and calls sometimes just to take a break.

Point is you just feel normal once it happens.
Your SP is just another human being like you.

So stop obsessing.
Stop thinking, ‚ÄúOh no! My SP blocked me, my life is over.‚Äù
That‚Äôs all noise. Let it go.

Manifesting your SP is the easiest thing on the planet.

Just assume you already have your SP. Smile.
The rest will be taken care of.

I hope this helps you.

1meioyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/1meioyo/is_there_anyone_left_who_still_wants_to_take_this/,üî¥ Is there anyone left who still wants to take this seriously?,"Yesterday I was talking to a friend of mine (20 yo more or less), he said to me that he wanted to start a career as a drummer in a grunge band. So I asked him if he was ready to accept failure, because i told him he'll fall a lot before being able of standing on two feet, but he said that it would be an easy job for him, because he could find his band mates online, ask his uncle to make his band play in front of his little coffee shop (which is also very far away from the city center, btw) and use ""all the money"" that they'd earn to ""pay a manager"" who'd help them ""grow big"". I should mention he‚Äôs been studying drums for two years and honestly doesn‚Äôt care much about practicing.  
  
  
Lately I‚Äôve been talking to a lot of people who want to make it in the creative world‚Äîmusicians, producers, songwriters... So he's not the only one.

  
But there‚Äôs one thing that keeps coming back to me:

Some believe in what they‚Äôre doing.  
Others say they do, but deep down, they don‚Äôt.  
Many think they‚Äôll make it without the late nights, the empty gigs, the broken strings and broken plans.

Very few are willing to build something real, with all the cracks, the feedback, the grind, the silence.  


So I‚Äôm asking:

Are there still musicians out there who are HUNGRY?

Hungry to create something that feels real.  
Something that‚Äôs worth the time, the sweat, the pain.  
Something that makes you say: *this sound is mine*.  
  


**I‚Äôm not recruiting for a project, and I‚Äôm not selling anything, no course, no promises, no fake hype.**  


  
I‚Äôm just curious: who still feels that FIRE burning?  


* Do you have an idea that keeps you awake at night?
* Have you ever dropped everything to reach your goal?
* Have you tried and crashed‚Ä¶ but the urge keeps coming back?



If this speaks to you, speak back. You don‚Äôt need a name, but it might help others reach their goals.

The atmosphere in the chamber was tense. Reddish light bathed every surface as V√≠ctor and the rest of the hunters prepared their gear. Looking around, everyone hoped for a good hunt. They had been trapped in the narrow, claustrophobic corridors of this ship for twenty-two grueling days, with little to do.

The only thing better about this mission compared to previous hunts he had been on with the Axur was the abundance of human female company. As he watched the assault Sepia pilot suit up, he couldn‚Äôt help but admire how the suit beautifully complemented her figure.

From where he stood, he could smell the girl‚Äôs nerves. He approached her silently and grabbed her from behind, lifting her off the floor while Paula began to struggle, hitting him with her elbows‚Äîwithout much effect‚Äîagainst the chest armor.

‚ÄúVICTOR, let me go, you brute!‚Äù  
Victor laughed and set her down.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre way too tense, Paula. You need to relax or it‚Äôll hurt more**.**‚Äù  
Paula turned to slap him, but Victor caught her hand.

‚ÄúSave it for the Fedies, tigress.‚Äù he said, letting go and taking a step back.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you stop bothering me and go finish getting ready?‚Äù  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm already ready for whatever the Fedies try. You‚Äôll see‚Äîmost of them will crumble in fear when we board them.‚Äù

‚ÄúEasy for you to say. We have the hard job,‚Äù Paula replied as she turned to finish checking the drones docked to the penetration arms of her Sepia.

V√≠ctor contemplated the machine, hanging from its ceiling mounts. As much as he enjoyed teasing the girl, he had to admit it took serious guts to go into battle in the vacuum wearing what was basically a glorified exo-labor rig.

""I thought you were a total pro with these toys, after five years hopping from asteroid to asteroid.‚Äù  
‚ÄúPlus two years of training. But asteroids don‚Äôt shoot at you or have a bunch of animals with plasma weapons trying to roast me alive from the inside**.**‚Äù

Gently, V√≠ctor placed a hand on her shoulder, turning her to face him. The girl was attractive in that youthful way, like a hardened teenager. Her fangs were perfectly white, without a single chip. Her hazel eyes betrayed that she had never seen real combat.

‚ÄúStay calm. Follow your training. If things get too hairy, regrouping is always a valid option.‚Äù  
‚ÄúI think the captain‚Äôs pretty interested in us taking the Fedie ships.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThe captain‚Äôs comfy in her command chair. You worry about covering your ass‚Äîit's a pretty nice one.‚Äù  
Paula laughed a little, looking at the scar on V√≠ctor‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre one to give beauty advice.‚Äù  
Victor laughed, running a hand over the burn scar that covered the left side of his face‚Äîa souvenir from a Gollid exterminator and his damn flamethrower during his third mission with the Axur.

‚ÄúGives me character. Plus, it helps get discounts at bars.‚Äù  
‚ÄúThen it‚Äôs almost like a pay raise, considering how much you spend at them. But you‚Äôre right, it does give you a Freddy Krueger kind of charm.‚Äù

They both laughed. Then he helped her climb into the cockpit and strap into the harnesses. When the hatch closed, he stepped away from the Sepia. Its appendages folded in, protecting the pilot‚Äôs cabin.

*Take care, Paula.*  
V√≠ctor thought as he went back to put on the rest of his gear and anchored himself to the wall, waiting for the combat maneuver signal.

**Officers‚Äô Quarters**

Soraya was watching the coffee machine as it finished heating the water for the last of the cups. Once it was ready, she poured the contents into the large mug, adding a touch of milk, cream, and four measures of sugar¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how you can like it this sweet, Yeon. The whole point of good coffee is to have a bit of a bitter aftertaste.‚Äù

Once she finished preparing it, she placed the thermal mug on the same tray with the other six and left the quarters, heading down the ramp that led to the armored entrance of the command bridge.

As she entered, Abel stood up from the command chair and returned to his usual station. Soraya went around distributing the coffees to the various posts, leaving Yeon‚Äôs as the second-to-last. After placing the mug on the magnetic cup holder, she tapped him on the shoulder to get his attention. At that moment, his eyes focused on her, indicating that he had returned to reality.

‚ÄúDrink it before it gets cold.‚Äù

Yeon nodded with a slightly guttural sound, and Soraya went to her command seat, placing her own coffee in the respective cup holder.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the status of the other groups, Abel?‚Äù

‚ÄúExcept for group eight, all are already proceeding to the rendezvous point. They only sustained minor damage. So far, the only escorts encountered were frigates and a couple of destroyers.‚Äù

Soraya nodded and turned to Xerxes, preparing to ask the most hated question by any commander with a shred of decency:

‚ÄúCasualties?‚Äù

‚ÄúTwelve dead and seventeen wounded. Four Sepias lost and the general inventory of kinetic munitions down by fifteen percent.‚Äù

They both lowered their heads slightly. This time, they weren‚Äôt just markers in a simulation. After a brief pause, Xerxes continued:

‚ÄúAmong the captured spoils, we counted around five hundred and twenty-seven ships. The manifests indicate a real fortune in resources and components. I‚Äôve already started inventorying them by importance and the capabilities of specific ships. Besides that, we captured a total of one thousand five hundred and forty-three prisoners. I must point out, that leaves us with only about twenty-four days of supplies if we don‚Äôt include what‚Äôs aboard the captured vessels.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood. In the worst case, we‚Äôll have to coordinate a supply transfer later on.‚Äù

Soraya opened a connection to the neural link and checked the status of the assault troops from the Kraken and the Echidna. Eighty-four Sepias and four assault platoons. All reported ready for the operation. One hundred and eighty lives‚Äîsome of them certainly wouldn‚Äôt return.

She opened a direct broadcast to all assault personnel on both ships.

‚ÄúThis is the Commodore speaking. I know for many of you, this is your first combat. Doubt is natural‚Äîeven the veterans among you share it. The task ahead of you is difficult, but so was the road you took to get here. You overcame what once seemed impossible. I know you‚Äôll do it again.

We‚Äôve all trained for years for this day. No one could be more prepared than we are. Today, those who tried to silence us will hear our voice.

You will bring them the howl of our forebears‚Äîstill echoing in the ashes of Terra‚Äôs winds. We are bound by the brotherhood of our blood‚Äîeach of us a precious child of humanity‚Äîand we will be victorious.

May fortune be with you, and may your hunt be bountiful.‚Äù

When the transmission ended, Captain Marquesi from the Echidna opened her link.

‚ÄúBit stiff, don‚Äôt you think, dear?‚Äù

‚ÄúSpeeches were never my strong suit. You were always better with social flair back at the academy.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was fine‚Äîmaybe a bit more vigor and violence, if you ask me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind for next time. But I also don‚Äôt want them getting too carried away and dying. Are you all set on your end?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, Soraya, always so calculated and professional. You should enjoy the hunt a little more.

Anyway, everything‚Äôs ready and targets pre-selected.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Happy hunting‚Äîand please take better care of your ship. The road to Sol is still long.‚Äù

‚ÄúHappy hunting to you too. And I‚Äôm genuinely touched that you care so much about us.‚Äù

Soraya ended the communication and quickly drank her coffee. Once finished, she secured the empty cup in its receptacle and put on her helmet, checking the vacuum seals. Lastly, she strapped on the harness, which still made her feel constricted when breathing.

Speaking to all bridge personnel:

‚ÄúAlright, this is our moment. We can‚Äôt let the rest of the squadron down. Let‚Äôs review tasks.‚Äù

Abel spoke first:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle damage control and general monitoring.‚Äù

Heinrich followed:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll optimize weapons systems and handle interceptions.‚Äù

Julio was next:

‚ÄúShip maneuvers and drones are on me.

Yeon waited his turn:

‚ÄúI‚Äôll focus cyberattacks on merchant vessels and coordinate the Sepias for direct takeover of targets once they‚Äôre neutralized.‚Äù

Pamela, the engineer, continued:

‚ÄúAs always, I‚Äôll monitor the systems‚Äîand make sure you don‚Äôt blow the ship to bits.‚Äù

Xerxes was the last:

‚ÄúAnd while you all fry your brains with the neural link, I‚Äôll keep an eye on your vitals in case anything goes wrong,‚Äù he said as he high-fived Pamela.

Soraya sighed once they finished. They all knew their roles by heart, but the little ritual was comforting. It gave them the peace of repetition.

‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs begin.‚Äù

At that moment, the battle stations alert sounded, and she began executing all the state changes one by one, until the neural link confirmed everything was green.

Xerxes gave her confirmation from his station.

At that moment, Soraya opened the warp sensor display. Within it, two reality bubbles were represented‚Äîone slow and massive, indicating the Federation convoy trying to escape from them.

¬†There were many ships‚Äîshe knew there was no way to force them out of warp. The combat would have to take place entirely within the bubble, in close quarters. She prepped both the magnetic accelerators for rapid fire and the plasma and particle shields. The drones from both ships were deployed to provide more defense against kinetic projectiles. She also deployed the Sepias, which took position behind the hulking masses of the two cruisers, as if they were their offspring.

¬†Karken Small Craft Bay

Paula saw the launch order appear on the data projection. She felt the vibrations of the crane moving her toward the airlock, and then the smooth motion as she passed through the polymeric nanite barrier that separated her from the outer vacuum.

Once released, she activated her thrusters, taking cover behind the Kraken. She had a panoramic view of everything‚Äîthe two enormous ships with their radiators glowing an iridescent red, signaling that the reactors were at full power. The swarms of drones clustering around the bows of the ships. The gigantic magnetic cannons on the prows shifting in anticipation.

The countdown ticked to zero, and the two reality bubbles began to merge.

At that moment, she saw the twenty-four Federation frigates waiting for them, ready for combat. The difference between anticipation and hell lasted only a breath. On both sides, a full spread of fire opened. The drone swarms interposed themselves in the path of the magnetic projectiles‚Äîbeing annihilated in the process or intercepting the slower plasma bolts with their own magnetic weapons. Plasma batteries from both sides struck shields, creating instant rainbows or sweeping at the clouds of drones. The impact of kinetic penetrators rained down on the frigates.

It took Paula a moment to realize she was crossing through that hell, feeling from both the machine and her own body the crushing force of the thrusters. The adrenaline, combined with the chemicals administered by the system, was overwhelming. She made several manual adjustments to the computer‚Äôs optimal courses.

Maintain unpredictability. Simulate divergent trajectories like a missed shot.

She repeated her training instructions to herself as they crossed the edge of the ocular of the bubbles. They received some fire from the frigates. Another Sepia exploded‚Äîhit directly about 40 kilometers off her starboard‚Äîbut after a moment, they had made it through.

She was inside the main bubble now, and the system‚Äôs indications were guiding her toward her target. That meant two things: she was alive, and she still had a ship to return to‚Äîfor now.

In the Mind of the Machines

Yeon had no body in that moment‚Äîher mind was projected outward, feeling every data node as part of herself. Hers first, and quickly the enemies‚Äô as well. She leapt from one to another, devouring them, leaving fragments of herself in each, watching the systems react. Infiltrating the ships‚Äô communications was as easy as whispering to a lover in a wedding nest, coaxing the caress she desired. Once she had access to the first systems, it was a matter of jumping from one to another, dominating them, overloading their sensors with a kind of digital schizophrenia until reality ceased to have meaning.

Every so often she had to look back at three-dimensional space, each time feeling like a part of herself was being ripped away. In those moments, she would see the ships and mark which had fallen under her song of madness‚Äîfor the Sepias.

Then, those little sisters of hers would pounce like the mythological sirens, devouring the unfortunate.

**Sepia 23**

Paula reversed her thrusters seconds before making contact with the enemy merchant ship‚Äôs hull. The eight arms of her Sepia latched on, and the plasma cutters quickly began carving through. A blast of vented gases enveloped her. Once the opening was large enough, the mechanical arms twisted, forcing the Sepia into the hole and starting to cut into the next deck. This time, the process was significantly faster. Paula‚Äôs heart pounded as she guided her unit toward the target‚Äîthe ship‚Äôs spine, where the various systems interconnected. It took her two minutes and seven decks.

¬†

When she finally reached the central trunk, she opened the Sepia‚Äôs arms and deployed the Hounds. They spread out, covering the decks she‚Äôd traversed, waiting patiently behind sealed doors that kept the rest of the ship from being exposed to vacuum. The flexible metal and polymer tentacles went to work, severing data-optic lines at overwhelming speed and rewiring them into her Sepia. She quickly began taking control of the ship‚Äôs systems, preventing the crew from regaining them and locking down bulkheads to isolate them into manageable groups.

It was complex work. While much of it was handled by automated sub processes, Paula had to keep strategic direction, reacting to the crew's responses. It reminded her, in a sinister way, of the parties she used to DJ in her free time.

Command Bridge ‚Äî Passenger Ship Ulharan

For Tavira, the situation was a nightmare. This was supposed to be her final voyage before returning to Venlil Prime. They were nearly to Aafa when everything started‚Äîalerts of coordinated attacks across the Federation. Even here, in its very heart. And things had only gotten worse.

When the frigates called nearby ships to gather in this holding zone, she had felt relief‚Äîdespite the long hours and the ongoing communications blackout. But the safety of the convoy had become a trap when the two Axur ships came for them. She‚Äôd hoped the escorts would protect them, but as soon as the combat started, multiple systems on the ship failed in a cascading breakdown. Now they were adrift and cut off.

She and the rest of her small crew were trying to reboot systems. The cursed machines resisted. The error messages piled up like insects overrunning a field. And then came the impact.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been hit! It‚Äôs a missile‚Äîit‚Äôs over!‚Äù yelled the young Gollid navigation chief.

‚ÄúShut up, idiot. If it had exploded, we‚Äôd have felt it,‚Äù shouted his fellow Gollid, Sorgen, the chief engineer. He continued, eyes on his screen:

‚ÄúIt penetrated the hull in sector G5. The airlocks sealed it off already‚Äî‚Äù Then his usually stoic face twisted with concern.

‚ÄúDamn it. It‚Äôs not a missile‚Äîit‚Äôs advancing through the decks. It‚Äôs some kind of boarding pod.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! They‚Äôre going to eat us alive!‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù said Captain Lurian with the imposing presence of his proud Kholshian lineage. He turned to Tavira.

‚ÄúAlert the passengers. Have them lock themselves in their cabins. Then coordinate with the exterminators‚Äîmake sure they eliminate those predators before they reach the passengers. That is your absolute priority. Sorgen, by your gods, I need communications with the escorts restored.‚Äù

Both replied, ‚ÄúUnderstood, Captain.‚Äù

Tavira immediately turned to the internal systems console, pulling up footage of the affected zone. The shape of the predatory machine was visible, its arms consuming the deck‚Äôs metal as it moved downward. Opening a channel to the ship‚Äôs defenders, she began guiding teams to intercept the intruder. It took them less than a minute to arrive. Encased in shining exterminator suits and armed with plasma rifles, they positioned themselves behind the airlocks sealing off the breach‚Äîready for the coming battle.

But the predatory machine kept moving. She had expected a group of bloodthirsty Axur, but this... it kept burrowing like a parasite into the Ulharan. Until it reached the deepest decks‚Äîthen the arms opened, releasing a swarm of smaller machines that reminded her of the horrifying Shadow stalkers.

‚ÄúTo all teams: the pod is releasing machine predators. They‚Äôre behind the bulkheads.‚Äù

A team leader quickly responded:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready. We‚Äôll stop them.‚Äù

Just then, the main machine extended a series of metal tentacles directly into the central trunk‚Äôs conduits‚Äîand her console went dead. Her crewmates experienced the same.

‚ÄúNO‚Äîdamn it!‚Äù shouted Sorgen.

‚ÄúIt was the pod. It did something to the main trunk!‚Äù

The captain, visibly shaken, opened the sealed panel on the left arm of his chair and pounded it in frustration.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs useless,‚Äù Sorgen said.

‚ÄúThey cut off all internal systems. We can‚Äôt do anything from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey want to capture us for their cattle pens... Sorgen, how long to reach the antimatter chamber and prep it for detonation?‚Äù

Tavira‚Äôs blood turned cold.

‚ÄúAt least twenty minutes, Captain,‚Äù answered the Gollid soberly, but with determination.

‚ÄúGood. Come with me‚ÄîTavira, you too. Bring the emergency communicators.‚Äù

They followed the captain to his office. Inside, he grabbed an incinerator from the wall.

‚ÄúThis thing never failed me in all my years of service. Sorgen, go with Tavira. Try to reach the aft escape pod. Tavira, use its comm systems to re-establish contact with the escorts. Then you, Sorgen, go to the antimatter chamber and prepare everything. If you find any exterminators on the way, have them escort you.‚Äù

Tavira was in shock. How could this be happening?

‚ÄúUnderstood, sir. Dead before cattle.‚Äù

They both nodded and left the bridge. When they reached the first structural bulkhead, the Gollid saw the door was sealed, even though the vacuum indicator showed atmospheric stability beyond. At that moment, the lights went out, leaving only the emergency indicators glowing.

‚ÄúBastards‚Äîthey‚Äôre in control of the systems. The Axur don‚Äôt do this‚Äîthey‚Äôre just animals,‚Äù he said, turning on his flashlight and starting to work on the door panel until it opened.

‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs humans?‚Äù Tavira asked, terrified.

The Axur were a known threat‚Äîbloodthirsty, animalistic predators. But the humans... they were different. Ever since the Federation tried to exterminate them, the Axur had enslaved them. Little was known, except that they participated in attacks sporadically.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs what I think. They‚Äôre more controlled‚Äîand some exterminators say they‚Äôre even more dangerous. We‚Äôll be much slower opening these doors manually.‚Äù

She couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling of being watched, expecting something to strike from the dark corners as they advanced‚Äîflashlights illuminating the once-cozy corridors. It was hard to believe these were the same halls she had walked for months. The long trek on foot exhausted her. She thought of her child‚Äîthe one she carried‚Äîand tears began to stream down her face.

Just two more days to return to Venlil Prime. And now she was trapped in this nightmare. She didn‚Äôt want to die.

Sorgen touched her shoulder.

‚ÄúHey, once we get to the pod, get inside and deactivate the beacon. If the worst happens, I‚Äôll signal you‚Äîlaunch the pod and wait among the debris. Our forces will come.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what about the others?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think about it. Save yourself. It‚Äôs all we can do.‚Äù¬†

The journey was slow, but they reached the pod bay. In the distance, plasma fire echoed through the dark corridors.

‚ÄúSee? It‚Äôs not over yet. Those bastards will see what we‚Äôre made of.‚Äù

Tavira gave him a weak smile. Once inside, she took the pilot seat, and he began disabling the beacon. Then he stepped out of the pod and gave her a reassuring hand signal.

She activated the communicator:

‚ÄúThis is Communications Officer Tavira of passenger ship NSCC Ulharan. We are under attack. We have been boarded by predators‚Äîrequesting immediate assistance.‚Äù

Sorgen kept moving. The screams and weapons fire were fading, which meant the battle up front was ending‚Äîand not in the defenders' favor.

Think. Think. How the hell are you going to cross that slaughterhouse?

As he reviewed the ship diagrams, an idea struck. He ran back to the sports deck. The path was much easier without alone. Once there, he entered the passenger vacuum locker, grabbed a public-use suit, and prepared to exit. It wasn‚Äôt ideal‚Äîthe suit had no room for his tools or the incinerator‚Äîso he ditched the latter and used practice bands to clumsily strap on the equipment he‚Äôd need.

Then he exited through the hatch.

**Command Bridge of the Kraken**

Soraya felt at the same time the satisfaction of seeing the ninth Federation frigate explode and the pain in her index finger that told her magnetic cannon number 7 was out of service. Close duels were unpleasant‚Äîimpossible not to take damage. The pain was not a completely unpleasant experience for her.

Only 378 seconds had passed since the cavity fusion. In that time, their shields had collapsed. Two-thirds of their drones were destroyed, one of their main cannons was out of service, and the hull of their ship had been hit by so much plasma fire that only active cooling with propellant kept the ablation within acceptable margins.

The enemy was in an even worse situation. Nine frigates destroyed by the Kraken and another eight by the Equidna. Six more under direct fire. Leaving the seventh frigate using the remains of another as a shield to close the distance and flank past it. Very creative and predatory on their part, she thought as she cursed. She couldn‚Äôt advance or reorient the ship because she had to keep the cannons and frontal armor facing the other three frigates. So the only option left was to accept what was coming.

As seconds turned into hours, two of the Federation frigates joined their destroyed sisters. At that moment, the seventh frigate made its move. Emerging from behind the remains of the ninth, aligning its magnetic accelerator directly with the stern of the Kraken, opening fire simultaneously with all its weapons at the exact moment the crusier secondary batteries responded in kind.

The hypervelocity projectiles hit directly on radiator number 1, piercing it. The coolant erupted like a geyser of artificial steam. At that moment,

Soraya activated the engines at maximum power to get out of the line of fire, while simultaneously focusing the frontal weapons on the last frigate directly ahead. Concentrated fire eviscerated it. The other surviving frigate performed a crossing maneuver behind the two cruisers while exchanging plasma battery fire with them. By the time both cruisers reoriented, it had taken cover behind one of the cargo ships.

Soraya was furious‚Äîthe bastard had done it again‚Äîwhen she received a call from the Equidna‚Äôs commander.

‚ÄúSeems like this one‚Äôs quite skilled. Better to hunt it together.‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep your distance and move underneath. We‚Äôll go above. Don‚Äôt let it get close or sneak into the center of the convoy.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

At that moment, she received a report from the chief engineer.

‚ÄúThe systems are overheating, and so is the hull. With the loss of the radiator, we have to finish in less than ten minutes to avoid problems.‚Äù

‚ÄúVenting propellant through the main cannon radiators. Abel, we‚Äôll use alternating fire at half power with close fragmentation.‚Äù

‚ÄúVenting, Captain.‚Äù

‚ÄúCannons reconfigured, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

Both ships advanced along their respective vectors until the frigate left its cover, trying to align its bow with the Kraken. They fired first‚Äîits shotgun-like blasts destroyed the frigate‚Äôs radiators and hull, disabling its magnetic accelerator. In response, the frigate accelerated, trying to ram them. The Equidna took a firing angle below the frigate‚Äîfour of its cannons fired in rapid succession.

They hit the rear section of the frigate, causing a catastrophic failure in its antimatter containment. The explosion interfered with the sensors for a few seconds. When they normalized, Soraya confirmed that no enemy remained. Satisfied, she asked Yeon via the link:

‚ÄúStatus of the Sepias.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe lost two in combat and another on one of the prey that chose to self-destruct. Twelve ships are still trying to repel boardings.‚Äù

‚ÄúList the data for me. Pamela, stabilize systems and give me a fluid inventory report.‚Äù Both acknowledged.

While issuing orders, she assigned boarding groups from both cruisers among the ships resisting the boarding.

At that moment, she received a private message from Marquesi on the Equidna: ‚ÄúDeploying the hunters. By the way, it‚Äôs a shame the damage your ship took.‚Äù

Damn bitch, she thought inwardly.

She then left the link to speak with Jerjes.

‚ÄúGo to the transport bay; prisoners will start arriving shortly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle it, and I‚Äôll be very careful.‚Äù

She smiled.

‚ÄúYou know what to do‚Äîbut take care.‚Äù

Transport Shuttle 4

V√≠ctor waited impatiently until he finally opened communications with Paula.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your situation? Are you okay?‚Äù

Nerves were evident in his voice when she replied:

‚ÄúYes. I managed to push them back. But they destroyed most of my hounds. They had a whole damn group of exterminators aboard.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Calm down, we‚Äôre arriving. Link with our systems and mark the survivors.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, eight remain; I‚Äôm marking them on your systems.‚Äù

She checked the HUD inside his helmet and turned to speak to the team.

‚ÄúOkay, we have six exterminators‚Äîone probably wounded. We‚Äôll ambush them in a T near the bridge. When we kill them, we take the bridge. We have two more targets there. After that, we sweep the ship from bow to stern and start sending passengers out in rotations‚Äîtwo of us for every eight of them. I want self-control, people‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a planetary assault with lizards.‚Äù

The team nodded‚Äîsix versus six, with Paula‚Äôs support in the systems, should be enough. Feeling the vibration of the docking clamps, everyone stood and prepared to open the airlock.

When opened, the darkness of the Federation ship‚Äôs corridors greeted them. Nothing their senses or their suits couldn‚Äôt compensate for. There were no stragglers in the first hallway. Upon reaching one of the main corridors, they split into two groups‚Äîone continued along that corridor, the other toward the main corridor of the other wing. With Paula assisting the exterminators through ship systems and her two remaining hounds, they took positions in the main port corridor and a perpendicular one.

When the exterminators arrived, they were paranoid, looking around and covering themselves with their weapons.

‚ÄúPaula, distract them.‚Äù

Behind the exterminators, the sound of the two hounds running was heard from the stern. When the exterminators began firing, waiting, V√≠ctor shouted through his comm:

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù

The exterminators had no chance to react. Caught in crossfire, they were cut down by V√≠ctor‚Äôs men.

He immediately approached and made sure to put a bullet in each silver visor.

‚ÄúPaula, we‚Äôre done with the exterminators. Let‚Äôs move to the bridge.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have a problem‚Äîone of them is in an escape pod near me, asking for help. Seems to be the flight officer of the ship‚Äîa Venlil.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn it‚Äîthat‚Äôs on the other side of the ship.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice; I was focused on the systems and the exterminators.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, it‚Äôs not like there are any of their forces outside. Can you handle her alone while we take the bridge?‚Äù

Paula hesitated a moment.

‚ÄúYes, I can handle her.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Let‚Äôs do that.‚Äù

Paula disconnected from the system, leaving it on remote operation, and opened the Sepia‚Äôs cockpit. Emerging, she turned and took the carbine behind her seat‚Äîpart of the survival gear. Only two magazines, she thought, securing them on herself. She walked to the bulkhead, bracing herself for the blast of air when she opened it. Then she entered the part of the ship still with atmosphere and quickly made her way to the escape pod from which the communications came.

Predictably, the door was closed. It took her two minutes to force it open. Recalling her light weapons training, she quickly entered the circular chamber inside the pod and located her target‚Äîa white Venlil, her abdomen swollen, completely petrified at seeing Paula. Her hand rested on the pod‚Äôs ejection controls.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt st‚Äî‚Äù Paula couldn‚Äôt finish the sentence before the door closed and the pod shot away.

The violent ejection and loss of artificial gravity disoriented Paula. When she regained footing hear a communication from some a emergency radio ""I am going to destroy the ship Tavira get out of here""

Disclaimer : Lengthy Post. Definately Helpful.

Is it Possible To Manifest SP against ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ?? 3P situation..No Contact for Years. Living in Different Countries.. SP told You they don't love you or whatever. 

My answer is YES. 
IT'S üíØ POSSIBLE TO MANIFEST SP Mo matter what You are facing or seeing in your reality. 

I myself Manifested my SP against all circumstances. Against all odds. Not even single situation or circumstance was in my favour. Still I Manifested my SP. 

Question is How I did it ?

It's simple to answer but quite difficult to understand n implement.

Soo here is my story and Guidance to get Your SP. 

Here is the Complete Story. ( Going to be lengthy but it ll help you to understand the complete journey ) 

I had a breakup with my ex-girlfriend in 2019.
I was shattered, but then I decided that I would attract a girl who was more beautiful and more loving than my ex.
I was very specific about the kind of partner I wanted.
I wrote down every detail I desired in my future partner her looks, aesthetics, behavior, nature, skin color, name, height, physique  everything.

Then I performed an imaginal act, as if I had already found my ideal partner. After that, I let it go; I didn‚Äôt obsess over it.
I did this exercise just for fun in March 2019. I still remember it clearly.

A few weeks later, I saw a girl from a distance, and I felt like she was the one.
Then I prayed to God, saying, ‚ÄúPlease, I want to know her. Do something  I just want to meet her once.‚Äù

I forgot about her and the prayers I had made in that moment.
A few weeks later, I received a follow request on Instagram from a girl. When I checked her profile, I realized she was the exact same girl I had seen a few weeks ago.

She even messaged me, saying, ‚ÄúDo we really know each other?‚Äù
I was like, Damn!
Then we started talking. Slowly, I began to realize that she was the exact same girl I had imagined during that fun exercise  the same aesthetics, the same height, the same traits. It felt like I had crafted her out of a raw mold.

But as we continued talking, it became clear that it was a one-way conversation. She wasn‚Äôt responding the way I had hoped  her replies were cold and distant.
Eventually, I found out that she had been in a relationship with a guy for the past 5‚Äì6 years.

Then I had a desire to meet her.
We met twice, just for an hour each time, over coffee. The conversations were normal and casual.

But for me, it was a win  almost like a miracle. I had wanted to meet her, and I did. That experience gave me a boost and confidence that there‚Äôs something magical about these higher forces.

The very next day, she moved to a different city.
After that, she got busy with her life, and we barely spoke over text.

That‚Äôs when I started exploring the Law of Attraction.
(I didn‚Äôt know about the Law of Assumption or Neville Goddard‚Äôs teachings on manifestation back in 2019.)
The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you in the present moment. Feel it as real, and feel good  just for the sake of the experience.‚Äù 

That was the only thing I knew about the Law of Attraction.
(I wasn‚Äôt aware of third-party situations, no-contact phases, self-concept, affirmations, or the SAT technique.)

The only thing I knew was: ‚ÄúImagine that person with you now, and feel as if it‚Äôs real.‚Äù

So, whenever I had a desire to talk to her or be with her, I would imagine having a loving conversation with her.
If I was sitting at a coffee shop and missing her, I would simply imagine her sitting next to me, holding my hand and loving me.
If I was having dinner, I‚Äôd imagine she was the one who cooked it and was feeding me with love.
If I was working out at the gym, I would imagine her helping me with the workout, taking gym pictures with me, as if we were doing it all together.

So basically, I just wanted to feel good as if she was with me now. I focused on my imagination and treated it as if it were real.

I was internally living in my imagination  as if we were already dating and in a loving relationship.

Now, the most important part: how did I ignore the third-party situation, the no-contact phase, and the fact that she was in a different city?

To be honest, it never really bothered me  because my ultimate goal was to feel good in the present moment. I chose to ignore everything else, as if it didn‚Äôt matter.

Third-party situation? I knew that couples break up eventually  it‚Äôs a very normal thing. I had gone through a breakup myself after a 4‚Äì5 year relationship, so I understood how common it is.
I didn‚Äôt focus on her boyfriend at all. I simply enjoyed the imagined scenes where she was my girlfriend, and I was her boyfriend  the best thing that ever happened to her. And she loved me deeply.

Period.

I did this exercise for a few months until around September or October 2019.
After that, she moved to her hometown with her boyfriend (a live-in relationship situation).
Then the pandemic happened.

To be honest, I lost hope. I was tired of doing the imagination scenes  my mind felt saturated with the idea that I already had my girlfriend. So I reached a point where I didn‚Äôt feel like doing any more imagination techniques. I was done.
(Neville Goddard calls this the Sabbath state  the state of wish fulfilled.)

I got busy with my own life. I deleted all my social media. I even deleted her contact.
Why? Because I had lost all hope and wasn‚Äôt expecting anything to happen.
I wasn‚Äôt expecting any outcome at all, simply because I didn‚Äôt know if these things actually worked or manifested in real life.

All I had wanted was to feel good  and I did.
Then, I let everything go.

After some time, I completely forgot about her. She was living her life, and I was living mine.

One and a half years later 

It was October 2021.
Out of nowhere, I received a call from an unknown number.
Guess what? It was the same girl.

She said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve moved back to your city  let‚Äôs meet.‚Äù

I was like, Holy f**... she still has my number?*
She literally called me after a year and a half?

At first, I thought maybe she had just moved back for work or something.
Then we started meeting more often.
And after some time, she proposed to me  and we started dating.

During this time, everything began to unfold exactly as I had imagined back in 2019.
The moment she pulled me in and kissed me, I realized  I had imagined this exact scene before.
Her waking up next to me... holding hands... walking down the street on a cold winter night, cuddling under a blanket... cooking dinner for me... washing my clothes...

I was like, Wait a second. Is this really happening?
It felt surreal as if I had already lived this in my imagination, and now I was experiencing it in physical reality.

Not gonna lie every single thing I had once imagined was replicated exactly as it was.

That‚Äôs when I truly started believing in the Law of Attraction.
I began studying it more deeply, and eventually, I came across the Law of Assumption.

Then I realized I had actually been practicing the Law of Assumption all along.
Telling myself: ‚ÄúShe is my girlfriend. We are in a relationship. We are living together.‚Äù

Imagination was just the technique  the tool I used to assume my desired reality.

We all wonder what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes, especially when we don‚Äôt see any movement in the physical reality.
Instead, we often see the opposite of what we desire.

We see our SP (specific person) with a 3P (third party).
We see them going on trips, romantic dates, and sharing happy moments.
Right?

And then we start questioning:
""How is it even possible to manifest? I‚Äôm seeing no movement. I can literally see my SP with someone else. They look happy. My SP is in a different city. We haven‚Äôt spoken in months.""

All those negative thoughts start creeping in.

So, I started digging deeper.
Out of curiosity, I began asking her questions  I wanted to understand what actually happened during those two years we were apart behind the scenes.

I asked,
‚ÄúHow was your relationship during those two years of the pandemic, when you were living together?‚Äù
(Why did I ask that? Because I had assumed they must have been happy together  enjoying a romantic, loving time.)

But her response shocked me.

She said,
‚ÄúWe were just living under the same roof. My boyfriend was always occupied with work. He hardly had time for me. I was depressed. We used to fight almost every day. We only went out a few times just to feel better, but we were constantly arguing. And honestly, we had zero physical intimacy during those two years. I was just eating, feeling low, watching YouTube and Netflix, and sleeping.‚Äù

Then I asked her,
‚ÄúDid you ever think about me during that time?‚Äù

She replied,
‚ÄúYes, I used to think that whenever I visited my hometown, I‚Äôd want to meet you again.‚Äù

I asked her,
‚ÄúWhy did you move to Pune?‚Äù

She said,
‚ÄúActually, I had been planning to move to Mumbai for two years for my career  not Pune. But suddenly, at the last moment, I changed my mind and decided to move to Pune instead.‚Äù

Then she told me that when she moved to Pune, she contacted almost everyone  except me.
She confessed that she had bad experiences with the guys she met after moving to Pune.
These were guys who had been in constant contact with her for the past two years  texting and calling her every day.
On the other hand, I was in a complete no-contact situation.

Then, one night around 4 AM, she suddenly called me and asked to meet as soon as possible.
We met around 7 AM that same morning.

I was thinking, Why is she calling me out of nowhere after two years  and at such an odd time?

After that, we started meeting more often and spending time together.
She began to enjoy my company, grew fond of me, and eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

So, what‚Äôs the learning from this experience?

I‚Äôve completed my journey  from zero contact to being in a relationship.

The biggest lesson: Movement is always happening behind the scenes even if we can‚Äôt see it.
We often try to look for signs of movement by checking Instagram stories, social media accounts, following lists, their status with the third party, their pictures together, etc.
We see these things and instantly give them negative meaning:
""Oh, this isn‚Äôt working.""
""They look so happy together.""
""There‚Äôs no movement.""

But remember  what we see isn‚Äôt always the truth.
We never know what‚Äôs really happening behind the scenes.

When I looked back and connected all the dots, I realized everything was actually unfolding in my favor.
Every situation that seemed like a setback was secretly working for me.

The pandemic happened.
She moved back to her hometown and started living with her boyfriend at first glance, that seemed like an unfavorable situation.
But in reality, it was working in my favor.

She even told me that during the time she lived with her boyfriend, she realized she couldn‚Äôt see a future with him  she couldn't marry him.

Other guys were constantly in contact with her for two years, some even proposed to her  but she rejected them all.
And eventually, she ended up proposing to me.

It was all a series of events  silently aligning in my favor.

How did she change her mind and move to my city when she originally wanted to move to a different one?

Because it was my imagination.
I had imagined us being together.
I didn‚Äôt ask her to come to my city.
She made that decision on her own  or at least, it appeared that way.
I didn‚Äôt influence her directly.
I simply imagined us being together, and somehow, she changed her mind  as if it were her own choice.

It‚Äôs that simple.
You don‚Äôt have to convince or influence another person to change their mind.
You don‚Äôt even have to lift a finger.
The Universe has infinite ways to fulfill your desire.

I wasn‚Äôt questioning how it would happen 
She already had a boyfriend‚Ä¶
She had already moved to a different city‚Ä¶
We weren‚Äôt even in touch regularly  no texting, no calling.

But none of that mattered.
The only thing that mattered was what I imagined, and what I assumed to be true.
The rest wasn‚Äôt my job  it was the Universe‚Äôs job to make it happen.

How and why did she break up with her boyfriend after 5‚Äì6 years of being in a relationship?

I never asked her to leave her boyfriend.
I never forced her or influenced her decision in any way.
All I did was imagine the two of us being in a loving relationship together.

Eventually, it was her boyfriend‚Äôs own behavior that led to the breakup.
I didn‚Äôt ask him to act a certain way or to fight with her it all happened naturally.

After spending two years living together under the same roof, she decided to leave him  after a 5‚Äì6 year-long relationship.

I didn‚Äôt do anything externally.
I simply imagined that she and I were together in a relationship.

The rest? A series of events unfolded on their own.
Everything happened behind the scenes 
Things you can‚Äôt see on social media, TikTok, or WhatsApp statuses.


Now, let‚Äôs talk about something that almost everyone in the manifestation community asks:

""How many times should I do affirmations?""
""How many times should I repeat the visualization scene?""
""Should I do the 369 or 555 technique?""

Here‚Äôs my honest experience:

I never did any affirmation routine.
I never repeated my imagination or visualization scene more than once.
I never did the 369 or 555 technique.

I was doing it purely as a fun activity.
Like  I‚Äôm in the bathroom, and I‚Äôd imagine my girlfriend banging on the door just to irritate me.
I‚Äôm taking a shower, and I imagine her wanting to join me  just for fun.
I‚Äôm washing clothes or cleaning my room, and I imagine her saying, ‚ÄúStop! I‚Äôll do it for you.‚Äù

That‚Äôs the key: Make manifestation a fun experience, not a burden.
You‚Äôre supposed to feel good after imagining  not anxious.


The Most Popular Question in the Manifestation Community:

""When will it happen?""

The honest answer: NO ONE KNOWS.
And if you really want your manifestation to happen fast, stop focusing on time.

If you just imagined your SP right now  why are you trying to experience it again?
If I‚Äôm already in a relationship with my girlfriend in imagination, I don‚Äôt sit around wondering when it will happen  because I already feel like it‚Äôs real.

And when you live from that assumption, things manifest in the quickest way possible.

It requires patience.
If you keep checking your outer reality for signs, you‚Äôre actually delaying your manifestation.


My Tips (From Personal Experience):

Everything is possible.

Circumstances don‚Äôt matter  no matter how bad things seem.

Your SP loves you and wants you just as much as you want them.

3P (third party) is irrelevant. Ignore them.

Nothing is permanent. Everything is changeable as per your desire.

Your only job is to decide exactly what you want  and stick to it. Ignore everything else.

The ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù are not your job  that‚Äôs the Universe‚Äôs job.

Don‚Äôt get obsessed with techniques or what coaches say. It‚Äôs not necessary to affirm every day or visualize every night.
Do it because it‚Äôs fun, not because you‚Äôre desperate.

You are more important than your SP.

What Does It Feel Like to Finally Get Your SP?

My experience?

At first, I thought my SP was out of my league.
She‚Äôs a professional model, very beautiful.
I thought it would be a miracle just to meet her.
I believed it would be magical if she ever kissed me.
I felt I would be lucky if I ever got to date her.

That was my mindset during the manifestation phase.

But when we actually started dating?

She turned out to be just a normal person like me.
She literally said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky to have you.‚Äù
She kisses me almost every passing hour  my lips actually hurt now.
I get irritated sometimes because she‚Äôs so physically and emotionally obsessed with me.
She calls me every hour, texts me like crazy ‚Äî and I purposely ignore her texts and calls sometimes just to take a break.

Point is you just feel normal once it happens.
Your SP is just another human being like you.

So stop obsessing.
Stop thinking, ‚ÄúOh no! My SP blocked me, my life is over.‚Äù
That‚Äôs all noise. Let it go.

Manifesting your SP is the easiest thing on the planet.

Just assume you already have your SP. Smile.
The rest will be taken care of.

I hope this helps you.

Finally‚Ä¶ before we start -

# CJ: PAY YOUR ARTISTS! PAY YOUR STAFF! REFUND ALL KS BACKING REWARDS! YOU ARE A COWARD! YOU HAVE RUINED THIS SITE BEYOND ALL REPAIR. GOOD WORK BUCKO.



# alright‚Ä¶ now‚Ä¶. The Founding

Santae is a virtual pet site in the style of Neopets or Flight Rising. It was created by CJ, also known as Charles, Jubilee, Ken, truckerman, ~~Kilo~~, and a few other names depending on the day/year/project. The site was pitched as a browser-based virtual RPG world with a class system, star signs, NPC relationships, skill trees, battle systems, immersive quests, and more.

None of those things have ever been implemented.

At its core, the gameplay is still just collecting pets and dressing them up, while hoarding items in case they become useful one day.

CJ had previously run another petsite called Lurapets, which is now defunct. That site had a reputation for mistreating artists and staff, and users eventually discovered that CJ was the same person as Ken, the owner of Lurapets. When this was confirmed, the mask started to slip. If you want a deep dive on that connection, another user made [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bJvwBmxFgKEyOsqwvSqUSSJ1wgQrNaCVQaXx3AyMNxk/edit?tab=t.0) that goes into artist mistreatment and asset reuse, and CJ's dishonesty in various situations.

CJ funded Santae through a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/santae/santae-enchanting-virtual-pet-and-avatar-rpg) launched in August 2024. It hit its funding goal in about 30 minutes and eventually raised over $106,000, making it the most successful petsite Kickstarter to date. This number is going to be important later.

Alpha testing ran from May to October 2024. At the end of alpha, all user progress and most pets were wiped. Santae doesn't have unique pet names like Neopets, so there can be multiple pets named ""Dog."" But the first one gets a special First Edition badge, which led to a mad scramble for desirable names when beta testing began. This was widely disliked by users at the time, though now that seems like small potatoes compared to the coming storms.

Closed beta started in October 2024 and brought the introduction of the referral system. In January 2025, users could earn Referral Points (RP) for bringing in new players, which could be spent in a special shop. The most prized item? The Divine Wispyr Figurines, which could turn a pet into the very exclusive Wispyr species. On the user marketplace, these often sold for premium currency equivalent to $50 or more. That price is going to matter soon too (watch out for cannons!!).

To date, CJ has already burned through more than 70 staff members‚Äîartists, moderators, admins, you name it. Turnover was constant, staff morale was nonexistent, and the userbase was struggling to find a groove.

All of this isn't even touching on the fact that the owner lied about AI usage in NPC portraits, which he very clearly said were all human-drawn. The community pushed, and finally he admitted they were AI based, but it wasn't his fault! Guys it's not his fault, he's just the owner!! This is still an ongoing issue, thought apparently the NPC's will be replaced with new art eventually. Currently, there are accusations of AI usage in the writing of the site.

This is all just the start, really. Pretty much all of this is nothing compared to what came next.



# Gift Bombing, Site Economy, and CJ's use of Funds

CJ started personally launching what he called the ""gift cannon,"" randomly giving out items ranging from basic materials to ultra-rare, high-value prizes. Sometimes he'd hand out premium pets or items to individual users for seemingly no reason. This eventually became a site feature , but in the early days, it was just CJ playing Oprah. Users started staying online for absurd hours in fear of missing a cannon drop, since many items weren't obtainable through any other means, and the items themselves were so valuable that if you missed one, it was months of saving to try and yoink one elsewhere..

It‚Äôs also important to note that a pillar of the site‚Äôs ethos is that there will be no FOMO. Everything, including the kickstarter items, will rotate back into the cash shop at some point, allegedly. But yeah, shooting expensive items that people save up for months for out of a cannon to only players online is a great idea to avoid FOMO...

These gift cannons have been frequently compared to love bombing, as players felt that CJ would try to bury any controversy or negativity with gifting these items to everyone.

Unsurprisingly, these gifts kind of broke the site economy. There had already been issues with restocking and balancing NPC shops, and now CJ was just firing currency and prizes into the void. Items, like the Divine Regal Wispyr Figurine, were once worth around $50usd. At the current time, there are some for sale on the site's usershop market for 1m sP, equivalent to about $0.33usd.

There‚Äôs a whole separate post that I could make regarding the topic of economy in the site, but in short: it was a mess. and continues to be a mess.

Also around this time, there were whispers of CJ misusing Kickstarter funds. This is unfounded, but was hinted at by former staff. There is no current resolution to this thread.

The TOS stated that CJ could ban anyone for any offsite behavior he didn‚Äôt like. This included merely interacting with a Tumblr blog known as Santae Salt.

In some of the following screenshots, a ‚Äúsalt blog‚Äù is mentioned. This is Santae Salt, a tumblr blog run by an admin known as Cloud or Cloudmin. CJ has long suspected that the blog is run by his former business partner MJ, who separated from the project early on and ALSO had an awful history of abuse.

It is not.

For context: salt blogs are common in petsite communities as a place for users to vent frustrations anonymously without fear of retaliation, for the better or worse. It‚Äôs not uncommon for users to pose as other users or impersonate staff on these blogs, but the purpose is usually to feed the drama a bit while having a place to vent about the site without fear of retaliation.

Also, reactions were banned from some Discord channels after users started spamming brick emojis during CJ's meltdowns. One user was banned for reacting to a news post about a new snake item... with a snake emoji. Allegedly, this was an auto moderator error. The server currently has either zero permissions or restricted permissions depending on the channel.



# Staff Stories and Public Unraveling

This is where things really started to fall apart. Former staff started speaking out. A former social media manager, superbearwars, made [this video](https://youtu.be/GqYUILvMCw4)¬†recently documenting their experience. It detailed manipulation, gaslighting, and emotional abuse.

CJ had been accused of [posting dictator gifs](https://www.tumblr.com/santae-salt/777113606106005504/imgur-com-a5eucnnl-and-people-wonder-why-things?source=share), such as Kim Jong Un and Elon Musk, in the staff Discord regularly, which many staff were uncomfortable with, [because of the implications.](https://y.yarn.co/16155e67-fda2-45f5-9c46-5657994d44ac_text.gif) Even after staff voiced these concerns, CJ continued the behavior, as did other members of staff. This was never addressed to the public, and led to a [walkout of staff in March 2025](https://www.tumblr.com/santae-salt/779649211252817920?source=share). CJ responded with an [ill-received, allegedly AI written letter](https://www.tumblr.com/santae-salt/779947397719670784/just-saw-that-the-santae-official-tumblr-replied?source=share). Many on staff did not come back after this.

Staff conduct in general was a concern. [Screenshots of the staff Discord](https://i.imgur.com/fbOtB8i.png) were leaked that revealed the way users were spoken about, and allegedly, this was a common occurrence.

According to Santae‚Äôs TOS, which once famously included a prohibition on talking about eating non-edible objects ([here‚Äôs a link to archived versions](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13x0EUNx9wRCuJk0huwpNWAXkEXmLvcet?usp=drive_link)), users were to uphold positivity at all times in all channels of communication. No, really.

>

This was not your normal ‚Äúno politics‚Äù rule either. This included any critique of staff actions, critique of gameplay, and critique that CJ personally deemed to be the wrong tone. You would say something needed to be improved, and the next moment you try to log on and you're banned.

Trevor was a new mod in the official Discord around the end of June. As all of this was ramping up, he was continuously deleting comments people were making regarding the mess that staff was making.

One incident saw Trevor(e) redirecting a conversation about gold leaf necklaces, in which he misunderstood the context and thought it was sexual in nature, leading to an erroneous timeout of multiple users. [Here‚Äôs some screencaps of the conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/5YzVb5d)¬†That lead to the nickname of Trevore.

Another major blow to CJ came when Ember, the site‚Äôs one and only programmer, announced he was leaving the team. He had sent a fairly [generic message to the users](https://i.imgur.com/SJpvwh7.jpeg), but a [more in depth one to the staff server](https://imgur.com/a/bZP8EXf). Of course, the staff server one leaked and users went wild. We‚Äôll come back to this, since it‚Äôs a section all on it‚Äôs own.

This led to many of his messages, even benign ones, [being emoji reacted to with tomatoes and bricks.](https://i.imgur.com/9k5ZBcX.jpeg) He was eventually removed from the moderation team after timing out most of the chatters.

Alongside that event, Jitterbug, another moderator, deadnamed a user, then in their own defense, posted the deadname of the user in the public Discord. This user in particular doesn‚Äôt want the event relitigated so I‚Äôm intentionally cutting this part short, but it was an event of note and an [apology is in this news post on the site.](https://imgur.com/a/bFwtzjm) It allegedly led to more training for staff on inclusivity.

This is also the news post where Crumble, another key player, is introduced. Crumble was hired as an admin on June 26th, supposedly to manage the site without CJ being the face of all communication.

Mistreatment of artists and staff is a continuous issue for CJ. Even non-staff users have encountered issues with CJ and his professionalism, and almost any user on the site that has interacted with him personally has a story about how it went south.

The userbase‚Äôs issues started to arise because of accusations of mistreatment and underpay of artists. Initially, CJ refused to make the pay scale of artists public. Despite over $100k in Kickstarter funds and a thriving community of monthly patrons through Buy Me A Coffee (BMAC), artists were being paid around $6 per item illustration. [Other rates for artwork were below industry standard](https://web.archive.org/web/20250721173526/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeLvD727gVe_piiC95RC6hBywxpVBVZdCbLQCH4Sm7nGTMKOQ/viewform), as seen here on the artist application for Santae. The pay rate was confirmed by CJ in September 2024, and has not changed. (Note: [during the Lurapets era in 2008, Ken/CJ was offering $1 USD for each item and $10-15 USD for NPC‚Äôs.](https://imgur.com/FaWRpQH))

All of these events were the catalysts of the current state of the site.



# Chargebacks and Crashouts

CJ had been crashing out in the official Santae Discord and the official tumblr blog for months.

[June 10th](https://web.archive.org/web/20250611023801/https://santaeofficial.tumblr.com/post/785983143323779072/setting-the-record-straight) was the first tumblr post, where CJ addressed the claims of AI usage and money mismanagement. The second was on [June 21st,](https://www.tumblr.com/santae-salt/787014533749325824/cj-your-behavior-is-completely-and-totally?source=share) as archived by Cloud. This was addressing, again, AI usage and CJ‚Äôs personal issues.

The third would be the largest and most grand breakdown to date.

Remember Ember, the programmer? The one that announced he was leaving? Yeah, well‚Ä¶. On June 26th, 2025 CJ [charged back his payment to Ember via Paypal,](https://imgur.com/a/Wu4lAAF) due to what CJ labeled as ‚Äúundelivered programming‚Äù (spoiler alert: Ember did deliver). This caused Ember‚Äôs paypal to go into the negatives, around $21,000 USD total. Once this was made public, users freaked out, for lack of a better term.

June 27th, 2025, was the day of reckoning for many users. This was when everyone found out about the chargebacks and DM‚Äôs were being leaked.

Due to this, [CJ proceeded to have the largest and most damaging crashout of his career](https://ibb.co/album/p2DGhc?sort=views_desc) and went off on users for HOURS in the chat. Threatening to shut the game down, saying he is going to quit, calling users ‚Äú[immature brats who are being rude as hell](https://i.ibb.co/0jjv2srK/117ienc8rhdox.png)‚Äù, and famously telling everyone to ‚Äú[suck my ass](https://i.ibb.co/Y4w7zmcY/123qtueodn-isok.png)‚Äù while he and his remaining staff and sycophants [metaphorically](https://i.imgur.com/g0GG7B5.jpeg) [dodged](https://i.ibb.co/R4TCXWkJ/1315bnw63b-6bex.png) [brick](https://i.imgur.com/dtlrZNe.png) [emojis](https://i.imgur.com/9IkEZjB.png) (that users were subsequently banned or timed out for). During this time the site‚Äôs servers went down, which allegedly CJ did manually.

After this crashout, the aforementioned new community manager Crumble [quit in a Discord post](https://i.imgur.com/BxuXRzc.jpeg). This was less than a day after being hired, citing CJ‚Äôs unprofessional behavior. No one was surprised.

Sky, another founding member of the site, [broke their silence on June 26th](https://imgur.com/a/eVGqiSL) as well to support Ember.

Keshi, a former art director, also [chimed in with their experience](https://i.imgur.com/mBl8x4m.png). This is in addition to another artist who [chronicled their interactions](https://i.imgur.com/6PW3QI4.png) with CJ way back in February. It‚Äôs also of note that around this time there was a [post made regarding CJ‚Äôs racism](https://www.tumblr.com/santae-salt/787583795848200192/hes-racist-too-yall?source=share).

The official server descended into chaos. For two days, the server was pretty much entirely unmoderated, and [CJ posted several apology posts](https://imgur.com/a/QnB0UFC). On June 29th, the server was closed for alleged restructuring and reflection, shown in the previous link. The server has not reopened since, but is allegedly planned to reopen by July 23rd.

During the time the server was on lockdown and the invoices still outstanding, users were making quite the ruckus onsite. Users made pets and accounts named [payEmber](https://i.imgur.com/wcUBRMk.png), changed avatars to show support, and protested in trades for awareness of the issue. There were also ‚Äúbrick Santae‚Äù pets and trades being created. [Here‚Äôs an image of some of them](https://i.imgur.com/NuHATPb.png) \- some pets are blurred due to being irrelevant. For some reason, pets that are removed are sometimes renamed with ‚Äúwas‚Äù in front of them instead of just being deleted. We don‚Äôt know why. The users who created trades were warned, but the trades themselves were not taken down, as CJ did not know how to do that, since he drove away the only developer.

CJ proceeded to ignore, warn, and/or ban players based on these behaviors, since organized [protests violated the TOS](https://i.imgur.com/OXao9TM.png). He hired on another developer, and posted a [news article](https://imgur.com/a/4T7Iovg) about the pending invoices. Users did not [take](https://i.imgur.com/0hCU9Qe.png) [the](https://i.imgur.com/Ms3D26S.png) [news](https://i.imgur.com/DTBv4JX.png) [post](https://i.imgur.com/oelqlfq.png) [well](https://i.imgur.com/BpQYj5n.png).

There were other unpaid invoices brought to light, one of the most prominent being FritzMyles‚Äô unpaid $222 invoice. Users again posted trades, made pets, and made accounts that used the phrase payFritz, which evolved into [PityZarf](https://i.imgur.com/Q4rXhgd.png), an anagram of the rallying cry. Fritz himself also created a document regarding the abuse he had faced during his time on the Santae team from CJ, [linked here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJkeqLaBclw9mXOOi7FssqFg4JgXT2RatKU6cnjaf1A/edit?tab=t.0) Please give it a read. If you read nothing else in this post, please read this one. His invoice sat unpaid for weeks, then the payment bounced once before it was actually fulfilled.

There are also currently TWO unpaid artists waiting for payment for past work.

One of these users rallying, Ellis, was singled out for punishment from the mods. The PayFritz pet was taken from her account and locked away. A ticket was made, and from there the situation devolved into CJ continuing his gift bombing behaviors. [Here‚Äôs a document covering that situation in more detail.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CJkeqLaBclw9mXOOi7FssqFg4JgXT2RatKU6cnjaf1A/edit?tab=t.0)

Soon after this, Crumble, who quit earlier due to the lashing out CJ was doing, rejoined the site. No one really knows what he offered to get her back on board, but it had to be good. This created some strife in itself, knowing that CJ was hiring new staff while there were outstanding invoices.

Then users discovered that the account IDs for Sky and Ember - both with single digit account ID numbers - had been deleted and reused for admin accounts without their permission. Those original accounts were banned and replaced without warning.

CJ once said during the most recent boycott that the site had made only $30 that week. Santae Entertainment LLC is also, inexplicably, registered as a hunting organization. Nobody knows why.



# Final Notes

Side note: Santae Entertainment LLC is actually registered as a hunting organization. We don‚Äôt know why.

The site is still technically running, but the community is in shambles, the forums are quiet, and many users have moved on. The Discord is still closed as of the time of this comment.

**However, we did JUST get an update from CJ in the official server:**

>""Hi everyone,

>I‚Äôm writing today to let you know that I will be stepping down in my position as the owner of Santae and will no longer be involved in any official capacity. I will not be doing development or site management moving forward.

>This is not a decision I made lightly. I‚Äôve poured my heart, soul, and personal finances into this project for many years. Santae has meant everything to me, and I truly tried my best, but I recognize that my best hasn‚Äôt always been enough.

>To those I‚Äôve hurt, intentionally or not, I want to sincerely apologize. Whether it‚Äôs a grudge held against me, a poor decision I‚Äôve made, or my actions having unintended consequences, I am sorry. I acknowledge that I‚Äôve acted impulsively at times, especially when my emotions got the best of me. My deep emotional and financial attachment to this project has sometimes clouded my judgment. I own that.

>The truth is, I‚Äôve heard the community, both the public and many of the staff loud and clear. I understand that my presence has become a source of division, and it‚Äôs time for me to step back completely.

>I‚Äôve reached out to someone I trust to take over the ownership role of Santae and am currently awaiting their response. I will not interfere, regardless of their decision.

>Santae is not shutting down. Our server costs have been covered for the next year, I just paid them. However, the project still requires roughly $500(+/-)/month to cover ongoing AWS expenses where our code and assets are stored. Other monthly expenses include programming and artwork. When additional funds have been available, they‚Äôve always gone toward marketing, not once have I paid myself.

>I can no longer continue down this road of personal financial strain and emotional burnout. Everyone has made it clear that my time here needs to come to an end and so, this is my farewell.

>Thank you to those who supported me, believed in me, and stood by Santae through the good and the hard. I‚Äôm endlessly grateful to you.

>\~CJ‚ù§Ô∏è""

  
EDIT JULY 29TH:

CJ decided to close the site, then reopened it... so this is continuing to develop.

**TL;DR:**

Man in his 30‚Äôs creates and destroys a promising new virtual pet site while abusing and underpaying staff, while somehow burning through his own 401k.

**Knit Style & Gauge:** The knit style and gauge influence the sweater's texture and drape. Fine-gauge knits offer a sleek and refined look, ideal for professional settings.

Whether you prefer a slim-fit cardigan for a tailored look or a relaxed-fit cardigan for a more casual vibe,the fit should be comfortable and flattering.

**Sleeve Length and Cuff Detail:** Sleeve length and cuff detail play a crucial role in the overall look and feel of the cardigan. Sleeves should be long enough to provide adequate coverage without being excessively long. Cuff details, such as ribbed cuffs or contrasting colors, can add a touch of personality and style.

Look for reinforced seams and quality stitching that will resist stretching or damage over time.

## FAQs Section

**What is the best material for a warm and comfortable cardigan?**

Merino wool and cashmere are excellent choices for warm and comfortable cardigans. Merino wool is known for its softness, breathability, and ability to regulate temperature. Cashmere is incredibly luxurious and provides exceptional warmth, but it may require more delicate care.

Hand washing is the best way to care for delicate cardigans. Use a gentle detergent specifically designed for wool or cashmere. Soak the cardigan in cool water for a few minutes, then gently massage it to remove any dirt. Rinse thoroughly and avoid wringing or twisting. Lay the cardigan flat to dry on a clean towel, away from direct sunlight or heat. Dry cleaning is also an option for some materials; always check the care label.

**What is the most versatile color for a cardigan sweater?**

Neutral colors like black, navy, gray, and beige are the most versatile choices for a cardigan sweater. These colors can easily be paired with a variety of other colors and patterns, making them suitable for a wide range of outfits and occasions. A neutral-colored cardigan is a wardrobe staple that you can rely on for years to come.**How should a cardigan sweater fit?**

1mei8bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mei8bk/appalachian_static_part_3/,Appalachian Static Part 3,"We burst through the laurel wall into a small, hidden clearing. Not natural. Ringed by towering hemlocks, the ground was unnervingly flat, covered in crushed gravel. And in the center, looking like a bunker designed by a paranoid badger, sat a single-wide trailer. But this was no ordinary mobile home.¬†

¬†¬†

It was armored. Heavy steel shutters covered the windows. Thick steel plates, welded haphazardly over the original siding, showed streaks of rust like dried blood. Coils of razor wire crowned a chain-link fence surrounding it, sagging in places but still vicious. A skeletal radio tower, bristling with antennas like insect legs, leaned precariously beside it. A single, caged bulb above a reinforced steel door cast a weak, piss-yellow glow in the downpour.¬†

¬†¬†

""Deke! Deke, you paranoid old coot! OPEN UP! IT'S EARL!"" Earl bellowed, hammering on the steel door with the heel of his good hand. The sound was swallowed by the storm. ""EARL TUCKER! AND I GOT PROOF! PROOF OF EVERYTHING YOU EVER RANTED ABOUT!""¬†

¬†¬†

Silence. Then, a metallic clunk. A narrow slit opened at eye level in the steel door. One intensely blue, bloodshot eye peered out, magnified by thick glasses. It scanned Earl, then me, then darted past us into the rain-lashed darkness behind.¬†

¬†¬†

""Proof?"" a voice rasped, thin and crackly like a bad radio signal. ""Proof, Earl Tucker? Or just more company goons tryin' a new trick? Heard the alerts. Heard the shots down by the creek. Sounds like containment protocol Delta to me. Sounds like breach.""¬†

¬†¬†

""It is a breach, Deke!"" Earl snarled, pressing his face close to the slit. ""Somethin' got outta a Union Carbide vent shaft! Somethin' that eats light and hums like the devil's own drill! It took Roy! It chased us from the Gentry place! It‚Äôs out here now, you fool! Let us in before it finds your damn rabbit hole!""¬†

¬†¬†

The blue eye widened fractionally. ""Roy? Roy's gone?"" A pause. Then, gears ground. Bolts slid back with heavy thunks. The steel door swung inward just enough for us to squeeze through. ""Get in! Quick! And wipe your damn feet! Tracker dust is a real thing!""¬†

¬†¬†

We stumbled into stifling heat and the overwhelming smell of ozone, solder, stale coffee, and unwashed laundry. The interior was a cave of organized chaos. Banks of flickering radios and monitors lined one wall, showing static, scrolling text, and weather radar. Maps papered every other surface, geological surveys, old mine layouts, hand-drawn charts dotted with frantic annotations. Shelves groaned under piles of technical manuals, UFO journals, and tattered copies of Soldier of Fortune. In the center, surrounded by it all like a spider in its web, stood Deke Ramsey.¬†

¬†¬†

He was skeletally thin, draped in stained overalls over a faded ""I Want To Believe"" t-shirt. Wispy white hair stuck out in electrified tufts. His eyes, magnified behind thick lenses, darted constantly, taking us in, scanning the bank of monitors showing exterior camera feeds, grainy views of rain-lashed woods and the razor wire perimeter.¬†

¬†¬†

""Roy,"" Deke repeated, his voice losing some of its crackle, turning hollow. ""Knew he shouldn't have took that data center job. Ground's thin over them slurry ponds. Thin and sick. Black Briar pumped it full of their sonic suppressors, but the resonance‚Ä¶ it bleeds through."" He tapped a complex device on his cluttered workbench, a tangle of wires, vacuum tubes, and a large, analog dial currently twitching erratically. ""My hum detector. Spiking like crazy since sunset. Not atmospheric. Sub-terranean. Deep and pissed.""¬†

¬†¬†

He focused his intense gaze on us. ""What did you see, Earl? Exactly. And what did you bring?""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl slumped onto a stool, cradling his arm. ""Somethin' tall. Dark. Not‚Ä¶ solid, exactly. Like lookin' at bad TV static shaped like a man. Ate the light from my Maglite. Eyes‚Ä¶ green. Toxic green. Cold."" He shuddered. ""Dragged somethin' sharp down Roy's doorframe. Left his boots sittin' neat.""¬†

¬†¬†

Deke‚Äôs thin lips pressed into a line. ""Marking its territory. Or its prey. Light-eating entities‚Ä¶ fits the old Shawnee tales. Mountain spirits gone wrong. Mishipeshu twisted by the deep drilling, the chemicals‚Ä¶"" He whirled, stabbing a bony finger at a yellowed, hand-drawn map pinned beside a monitor showing static. ""Union Carbide Vent #7. That's your leak. Becker Henderson, that fool kid, always pokin' where he shouldn't. Found a weak spot in Black Briar's 'shimmercrete' cap. Went down. Prob'ly found somethin' he shouldn't have touched."" He pointed at me. ""You. Video clerk. Becker gave you somethin'. What was it?""¬†

¬†¬†

""A tape,"" I said, the cold dread returning. ""Black. Unlabeled. Cold as a grave. Showed‚Ä¶ impossible things. Inside Hawk‚Äôs Nest, but not. Timestamps jumping decades. And‚Ä¶ them. Things moving in the dark. Green eyes.""¬†

¬†¬†

Deke‚Äôs eyes lit up with a manic gleam. ""A resonator! A focus! Black Briar uses 'em to map the resonance corridors, monitor the bleed points! Becker musta swiped it during a breach attempt! Or maybe‚Ä¶ maybe it let him take it. A lure."" He paced, agitated. ""That tape isn't just a recording, son. It's a beacon. A homing signal for whatever‚Äôs down there. Explains why it followed you so keenly. Why it's likely triangulating this location right now."" He gestured wildly at the humming detector, its needle now pinned hard to the right.¬†

¬†¬†

A proximity alarm suddenly blared from one of the consoles, a harsh, electronic shriek. A monitor flickered, showing a grainy, rain-streaked view of the perimeter fence near the woods. The image dissolved into swirling static, then cleared for a split second.¬†

¬†¬†

Enough.¬†

¬†¬†

Tall. Angular. A silhouette of purest black, darker than the surrounding night, standing motionless just outside the razor wire. Rain seemed to bend around it. And in the center of the static-smeared image, two pinpricks of sickly green light burned directly at the camera.¬†

¬†¬†

""It's here,"" Deke whispered, the manic energy replaced by icy calm. He slammed a fist onto the console, silencing the alarm. Lights inside the trailer dimmed, replaced by a deep red emergency glow. ""Perimeter breach imminent. Shimmercrete won't hold it long. It‚Äôs drawn to the resonator‚Ä¶ and to the leak."" He pointed a shaking finger towards the back of the trailer, where a heavy, riveted steel door stood beside a bank of humming electrical equipment. ""My back door. Leads to the old Kaymoor #3 adit entrance. Sealed since ‚Äô62. Mostly.""¬†

¬†¬†

""An old mine tunnel?"" Earl groaned. ""You wanna go deeper?!""¬†

¬†¬†

""Not deeper,"" Deke rasped, grabbing a heavy backpack and stuffing it with tools, spare batteries, and what looked like road flares. ""Across. Kaymoor #3 connects to the old Gauley Bridge network. There‚Äôs a path‚Ä¶ if the roof hasn‚Äôt fully collapsed‚Ä¶ that comes up near the Hawk‚Äôs Nest overlook. Away from Black Briar‚Äôs cordon. Away from it. We cut through the mountain's guts. Only way to break the beacon‚Äôs pull.""¬†

¬†¬†

Outside, a metallic screech tore through the storm‚Äôs roar. The sound of razor wire being torn like spider silk. The lights flickered violently. The hum detector screamed silently, needle buried.¬†

¬†¬†

""Decision time, boys,"" Deke said, throwing the pack at me and grabbing a pump-action shotgun sawed off at the stock. He threw a heavy lever beside the steel door. Bolts retracted with a hiss of pneumatics. ""Follow me into the dark, or stay here and become part of Deke Ramsey‚Äôs final, very messy broadcast. Your call."" He yanked open the steel door, revealing a yawning blackness that smelled of damp earth, rock dust, and something faintly metallic. The deep hum wasn't just outside anymore. It pulsed from that darkness. It welcomed.¬†

¬†¬†

The green eyes wouldn't be at the fence for long. The mountain‚Äôs poisoned veins lay open before us. Earl met my gaze, pain and grim resolve in his eyes. He nodded towards the dark doorway. The deep dark had forced our hand. Our escape route wasn't up the mountain anymore. It was straight into its wounded heart. The crowbar felt suddenly purposeful in my grip. We plunged after Deke Ramsey into the suffocating, resonant dark.¬†

¬†

The steel door slammed shut behind us with a final, echoing clang. Deke Ramsey‚Äôs red emergency lights died instantly, plunging us into absolute, suffocating blackness. The only sound was our ragged breathing, the frantic hammering of my heart, and the deep, resonant hum, louder now, pulsing through the rock walls like the mountain‚Äôs own diseased blood.¬†

¬†¬†

""Lights!"" Deke‚Äôs voice cracked like a whip in the dark. ""Low beam only! Headlamps! Conserve batteries!""¬†

¬†¬†

Fumbling clicks echoed. Three narrow beams of light snapped on, cutting shaky cones through the oppressive gloom. We stood in a low, rough-hewn tunnel. Timber supports, ancient and weeping moisture, lined the walls. The air was thick, cold, and carried the unmistakable scent of wet stone, iron, and that underlying metallic tang, the deep dark‚Äôs breath. Water dripped steadily somewhere ahead.¬†

¬†¬†

""Kaymoor #3 Adit,"" Deke announced, his voice tight. He swept his headlamp beam down the tunnel. It vanished into pitch black maybe fifty yards ahead. ""Straight shot for half a mile, then we hit the junction. Stay sharp. Watch for rotten timbers, washouts, and‚Ä¶ other things that ain't supposed to be down here.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Other things?"" Earl grunted, cradling his injured arm. His beam traced the damp, glistening walls. ""Like what? More of those glow-eyed bastards?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Like nothing your Paw-paw ever warned you about, Earl,"" Deke muttered, already moving forward with surprising speed, his sawed-off shotgun held low. ""The resonance‚Ä¶ it twists things. Mutates. Things that got trapped down here when they sealed it. Rats the size of dogs. Fungi that moves. Air that‚Ä¶ thickens."" He tapped a complex device clipped to his belt beside the humming detector, it looked like a Geiger counter crossed with a theremin. ""My PKE meter. Picks up anomalous energy fields. Like the one radiating off that damn tape you‚Äôre carryin‚Äô, clerk. Keep it shielded. Best you can.""¬†

¬†¬†

I instinctively clutched the canvas bag tighter against my side, the cold of the black cassette seeming to seep through the fabric. ""Shielded? How?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Lead would be best,"" Deke rasped, not looking back. ""Since we ain't got that, just keep it away from your ticker. And pray."" He paused, shining his light on a section of the wall where thick, rope-like tendrils of glistening black fungus crawled between the timbers. It pulsed faintly in the light. ""See? Sick ground. Resonant decay. Black Briar‚Äôs poison sinkin‚Äô deep.""¬†

¬†¬†

We pressed on, the tunnel descending slightly. The dripping intensified. The hum grew stronger, vibrating the wet rock beneath our boots. Earl stumbled, cursing as his bad arm scraped against a jagged outcrop.¬†

¬†¬†

""Easy, Earl,"" I said, grabbing his elbow.¬†

¬†¬†

""Don't fuss,"" he grumbled, shaking me off, but his face was pale in the headlamp beam. ""Just gettin‚Äô too damn old for spelunkin‚Äô with ghosts.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Quiet!"" Deke hissed, freezing. He held up a hand. His PKE meter emitted a frantic, high-pitched chirping. The hum detector on his belt buzzed angrily. ""Field spike. Close."" He slowly swept his headlamp beam down the tunnel ahead.¬†

¬†¬†

The light caught movement.¬†

¬†¬†

Not an entity. Not fungus. Water. But wrong.¬†

¬†¬†

Ahead, the tunnel floor dipped into a shallow pool, maybe twenty feet across, fed by a steady trickle from a crack in the ceiling. The water wasn‚Äôt the expected muddy brown. It glowed. A sickly, phosphorescent green, casting an eerie, undulating light on the wet walls and ceiling. And within the glowing water, shapes moved. Dark, sinuous shadows, eel-like but too large, coiling just beneath the luminous surface.¬†

¬†¬†

""Resonance bloom,"" Deke breathed, his voice filled with a mixture of dread and fascination. ""Bio-luminescent algae mutated by the leak. And the things in it‚Ä¶ Pike. Or what‚Äôs left of ‚Äòem. Mean as hell and drawn to the energy. Don't touch the water.""¬†

¬†¬†

""How do we get across?"" Earl asked, eyeing the glowing pool warily.¬†

¬†¬†

""Timber walkway,"" Deke pointed his light to the left wall. A narrow, rickety wooden platform, slick with moisture and green slime, hugged the tunnel wall just above the glowing waterline. ""Old inspection path. Rotten as sin, but it‚Äôs all we got. Single file. Slow and easy. No sudden moves.""¬†

¬†¬†

Deke went first, testing each plank with his boot before shifting his weight. The wood groaned ominously. The glowing water below churned, dark shapes swirling towards the disturbance near the edge. A large, eel-like head breached the surface, revealing a mouthful of needle-sharp, translucent teeth and eyes that were milky-white, blind orbs that somehow seemed to track Deke‚Äôs light. It snapped at the air with a wet click before vanishing back into the green glow.¬†

¬†¬†

""Lovely,"" Earl muttered, following Deke onto the precarious walkway. I brought up the rear, the crowbar held ready, my eyes darting between the treacherous footing and the churning, glowing pool below. The hum here was intense, a physical pressure in my skull.¬†

¬†¬†

We were halfway across when the wood beneath Earl‚Äôs boot gave way with a sharp crack.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl cried out, lurching sideways. His injured arm flailed, unable to grab the wet rock wall. He started to fall towards the glowing water.¬†

¬†¬†

I lunged without thinking, dropping the crowbar with a clatter and grabbing the back of Earl‚Äôs soaked flannel shirt with both hands. I hauled back with all my strength, digging my heels into the slick wood. Earl‚Äôs weight nearly pulled me over, but I held, dragging him back onto the trembling walkway just as a massive, dark shape erupted from the water where he‚Äôd almost fallen. Jaws lined with luminous teeth snapped shut on empty air before the creature splashed back down.¬†

¬†¬†

""Close call, old man,"" Deke said, not turning around, his voice tight. ""Move faster. This whole section feels like it‚Äôs vibratin‚Äô.""¬†

¬†¬†

Shaking, Earl regained his footing. We scrambled the rest of the way across the walkway, jumping onto solid rock on the other side just as a large section of the platform collapsed into the glowing pool with a splash. The water boiled with dark shapes.¬†

¬†¬†

""Thanks, kid,"" Earl panted, leaning against the tunnel wall, his face grey.¬†

¬†¬†

""Don't mention it,"" I gasped, retrieving the crowbar. The cold weight of the tape in the bag against my ribs felt like an accusation.¬†

¬†¬†

We pressed on, the tunnel narrowing. The air grew colder. The dripping water formed small, glowing green pools in the uneven floor. The hum was a constant, oppressive drone now. Deke‚Äôs detectors were screaming silently, needles pinned.¬†

¬†¬†

""Junction ahead,"" Deke announced, his voice barely audible over the resonant thrum. His headlamp beam illuminated a larger space where our tunnel met another, slightly wider one cutting across at a sharp angle. Crates, rotted timber, and rusted mining equipment lay scattered. ""Left takes us deeper into Kaymoor. Right‚Ä¶ right is the path towards Gauley Bridge. Towards Hawk‚Äôs Nest.""¬†

¬†¬†

He shone his light down the right-hand tunnel. It sloped downwards more steeply. Water ran in a shallow stream down the center. And something else. Footprints. Fresh, human-sized, but strange. Deeply impressed into the muddy sediment, but splayed, almost webbed, and glowing faintly with the same sickly green phosphorescence as the pool.¬†

¬†¬†

""Becker,"" I breathed. The tracks led down the right tunnel.¬†

¬†¬†

""Or whatever‚Äôs wearin‚Äô him now,"" Deke said grimly. ""The resonance‚Ä¶ it leaves a trace. A stain."" He adjusted his shotgun. ""We follow the trail. It‚Äôs the quickest way out. And maybe the only way to find out what that damn tape really is before it draws the big one down on our heads.""¬†

¬†¬†

He started down the right tunnel without hesitation. Earl shot me a look, a mixture of exhaustion, pain, and the grim resignation of a man walking into a bear trap. The green-glowing footprints seemed to pulse in our headlamp beams, leading us deeper into the mountain‚Äôs humming, poisoned heart. The air grew thicker, colder, tasting of ozone and decay. Somewhere far behind us, back towards Deke‚Äôs bunker, a faint, metallic screech echoed down the tunnels, followed by the sound of falling rock. The entity wasn't giving up. The hunt continued, both above and below. The only light was the beams on our heads, and the only path was marked by the fading, toxic glow of Becker‚Äôs steps.¬†

¬†

The air in the right-hand tunnel tasted like licking a battery. The deep hum wasn't just sound anymore; it was a physical pressure, vibrating the fillings in my teeth, making my vision blur at the edges. Becker‚Äôs glowing footprints pulsed a sickly green under our headlamp beams, leading us down the steep, wet decline. The phosphorescent pools grew more frequent, casting shifting, malevolent shadows on the dripping walls. Deke‚Äôs PKE meter shrieked a continuous, teeth-gritting whine, its needle buried.¬†

¬†¬†

""Resonance saturation,"" Deke rasped, his voice thin against the thrum. He wiped sweat and condensation from his thick glasses. ""Ground zero's close. Feel it? Like the mountain's got a fever.""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl stumbled, catching himself on a slick timber brace. His face was grey, his breathing shallow. ""Feels like my damn arm's vibratin' loose. How much further, Deke?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Junction to the old Hawk‚Äôs Nest access should be..."" Deke‚Äôs headlamp beam swept ahead, then froze. ""Well, hellfire.""¬†

¬†¬†

The tunnel ended abruptly. Not in a collapse, but in a wall. But this wasn't rough-hewn rock. It was smooth, unnervingly so, and dark. Not black like the entity, but a deep, non-reflective grey that seemed to absorb our light rather than reflect it. It looked poured, seamless, sealing the tunnel from floor to ceiling. Faint, almost imperceptible veins of that same sickly green luminescence pulsed within its surface, like circuitry under diseased skin.¬†

¬†¬†

""Shimmercrete,"" Deke breathed, a mix of awe and disgust in his voice. He tapped the wall with the butt of his shotgun. It gave a dense, dead thunk. ""Black Briar's fancy band-aid. Seals the bad air in. Or keeps things out. Either way, it‚Äôs a damn roadblock.""¬†

¬†¬†

Becker‚Äôs glowing footprints led right up to the wall... and vanished beneath it. As if he'd walked straight through the solid barrier.¬†

¬†¬†

""Did he phase through?"" I asked, the absurdity barely registering over the dread. The cold from the tape in the bag was intensifying, a localized ache against my ribs.¬†

¬†¬†

""Not likely,"" Deke muttered. He knelt, shining his light along the base of the wall. ""Look here."" Where the shimmercrete met the tunnel floor, there was a narrow gap, maybe an inch high, running the width of the tunnel. It wasn't empty. It was filled with a viscous, dark sludge that glistened faintly green in the light. Becker‚Äôs footprints seemed to merge with it. ""Overflow channel. For the resonance bleed. Too small for a man... unless he ain't quite solid anymore."" He straightened, patting his backpack. ""Means there‚Äôs a chamber on the other side. And likely a way in. Just gotta convince this fancy wall to let us pass.""¬†

¬†¬†

He shrugged off the pack, rummaging inside. He pulled out two thick, red cylinders, industrial-strength road flares, and a lumpy, putty-like substance wrapped in waxed paper. ""My little friends,"" he said, a manic glint returning to his eyes. ""Thermite putty. Burns hotter than a politician's promise. Should soften this Black Briar play-doh enough for..."" He glanced meaningfully at the crowbar in my hand.¬†

¬†¬†

""Blow a hole? In here?"" Earl gestured wildly at the dripping ceiling. ""You tryin' to bring the whole mountain down on us, Deke?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Calculated risk, Earl!"" Deke snapped, already kneading the putty into thick ropes. ""The resonance weakens structures, makes ‚Äòem brittle. This ain't solid rock anymore; it's rotten lace. This shimmercrete's the only thing holdin' this stretch up, and it's failin'."" He pointed to hairline cracks snaking up the tunnel walls around the seal. ""We blow a small hole, crawl through before the dust settles. Better than sittin' here waitin' for it to find the scent again."" He nodded back the way we came. The deep hum seemed to pulse with renewed intensity from that direction.¬†

¬†¬†

He worked fast, pressing the thermite ropes around the edges of the shimmercrete wall, focusing on the gap at the bottom. He jammed the flares deep into the putty. ""Alright, clerk,"" he ordered, not looking up. ""When I light ‚Äòem, we got about ten seconds of pretty sparks, then she‚Äôll burn white-hot for maybe thirty. Soon as it stops burnin' bright, you hit that softened edge with the crowbar. Hard and fast. Earl, you cover our backs with Betsy."" He tossed the sawed-off shotgun to Earl, who fumbled it awkwardly with his good hand.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke struck a match. The flare hissed to life, spitting angry red sparks. He touched it to the thermite putty. Instantly, it ignited with a ferocious WHOOSH, not fire, but pure, blinding white light and a shower of molten sparks that hissed where they hit the wet floor. The heat was instant and brutal, forcing us back a step. The shimmercrete wall glowed cherry-red where the thermite touched it, the green veins within flaring brightly, then seeming to writhe and fade as the intense heat consumed them.¬†

¬†¬†

""Get ready!"" Deke yelled over the roar of the reaction. The white light was blinding, casting stark, jerking shadows that danced like frenzied ghosts on the tunnel walls. The air filled with the acrid stench of burning metal and ozone.¬†

¬†¬†

The blinding white light suddenly died, plunging us back into near-darkness, except for our headlamps and the deep, sullen cherry-red glow emanating from the edges of the wall where the thermite had burned. The shimmercrete wasn't just hot; it looked softened, sagging slightly.¬†

¬†¬†

""NOW, FINCH!"" Deke bellowed.¬†

¬†¬†

I didn't hesitate. Gripping the crowbar like a battering ram, I lunged forward, ignoring the searing heat radiating from the wall, and slammed the chiseled end into the lower corner where the shimmercrete met the tunnel floor, right where the dark sludge had been.¬†

¬†¬†

CRUNCH!¬†

¬†¬†

The bar bit deep. It wasn't like hitting rock; it was like hitting dense, superheated clay. With a tearing, grinding sound, a chunk of the shimmercrete the size of a dinner plate sheared away, revealing absolute darkness beyond. Glowing slag dripped from the edges.¬†

¬†¬†

""Again! Widen it!"" Deke urged, pulling out a heavy pry bar from his pack.¬†

¬†¬†

I heaved, leveraging the crowbar. Earl stood behind us, the shotgun wavering as he scanned the tunnel behind us, his face etched with pain and terror. The deep hum seemed to be coalescing, focusing‚Ä¶ coming closer.¬†

¬†¬†

CRACK! Another chunk gave way. The hole was big enough to crawl through now, ragged edges glowing dull red. Beyond, the darkness felt‚Ä¶ different. Colder. Emptier. The metallic stench intensified.¬†

¬†¬†

""Go! Go! Go!"" Deke shoved me towards the opening. ""Earl, you next! I'll cover!""¬†

¬†¬†

I dropped to my knees, the heat from the opening scorching my face. I shoved the crowbar through, then scrambled headfirst into the unknown blackness.¬†

¬†¬†

I landed hard on cold, uneven rock. My headlamp beam cut through swirling dust and smoke, illuminating a vast, cavernous space. Not a tunnel. A chamber. High, vaulted ceiling lost in darkness. Massive, crumbling support pillars. And on the far wall, illuminated in my shaky beam, faded but unmistakable, were crude, decades-old graffiti marks: HAWK'S NEST SEC 7, KEEP OUT! and below it, a crudely painted symbol, an eye with a jagged tear through it. The same symbol Paw-paw had described the company men painting over.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl tumbled through the hole behind me, gasping, followed immediately by Deke, who spun, already pointing his pry bar back at the opening like a weapon.¬†

¬†¬†

""Seal it! Quick!"" Deke yelled, kicking loose rubble towards the glowing hole.¬†

¬†¬†

Before we could move, a sound echoed through the chamber from the tunnel we‚Äôd just fled. Not the hum. A sound of rending metal and splintering timber. A guttural, electronic screech that shook dust from the ceiling. And piercing the swirling dust and smoke still billowing from our makeshift entrance, two pinpricks of sickly green light ignited in the darkness of the breached tunnel, fixing unerringly on the hole we‚Äôd crawled through.¬†

¬†¬†

""It's through!"" Earl rasped, fumbling with the shotgun. ""It found the breach!""¬†

¬†¬†

The entity didn't rush. It flowed through the ragged opening we‚Äôd made, its shifting, light-eating form seeming to absorb the lingering glow from the heated shimmercrete. Rainwater dripped from unseen points on its impossible silhouette. The green eyes burned, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the Hawk‚Äôs Nest graffiti. The deep hum swelled, resonating within the vast chamber, a triumphant, predatory thrum. It had cornered its prey in the heart of the old wound. The crowbar felt pitifully small in my hand. Deke hefted his pry bar. Earl raised the shotgun, his knuckles white. The deep dark wasn't just outside anymore. It was in the room. And the only history written on these walls was a warning we'd arrived too late to heed. ¬†

¬†

Earl didn't even have time to look surprised.¬†

¬†¬†

One second he was standing there, sweat glistening on his weathered face, his good hand fumbling with the shotgun's pump.¬†

¬†¬†

A sound like a watermelon dropped on pavement.¬†

¬†¬†

The entity's strike was too fast to see. One moment Earl was whole, the next he was crumpling, a dark red blossom spreading across his chest like spilled ink on paper. His knees hit the stone floor with a terrible finality. The shotgun clattered from his limp fingers.¬†

¬†¬†

He blinked once. Just once. His mouth moved, forming a word that might have been ""Paw-paw"" or maybe just ""oh."" Then the light left his eyes, quicker than a blown-out candle, and he toppled sideways onto the cold rock.¬†

¬†¬†

Dead.¬†

¬†¬†

Just like that.¬†

¬†¬†

No last stand. Just a tired old man from Mill Creek who'd known too much and run out of time. His body looked smaller in death, the way all bodies do, just empty clothes and cooling flesh where a person used to be.¬†

¬†¬†

The entity loomed over him for a heartbeat, its green eyes pulsing. Then it turned toward us, already forgetting him.¬†

¬†¬†

I didn't realize I was screaming until Deke clamped a hand over my mouth. The sound that had torn from my throat didn't sound human. Earl's blood was pooling near my boots, so dark it looked black in the dim light.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke dragged me backward, his grip iron. ""Don't you look,"" he hissed in my ear. ""Don't you damn look.""¬†

¬†¬†

But I'd already seen. The way Earl's work boots, the same ones he'd worn every day for years, were still neatly tied. How his flannel shirt sleeve had ridden up to show the faded tattoo of a coal miner's pickaxe he'd gotten drunk at 19. The peaceful expression that had settled over his face in death, making him look younger somehow.¬†

¬†¬†

Then we were running, the entity's hum vibrating in our teeth, Earl left behind in the dark where he fell.¬†

¬†¬†

Gone.¬†

¬†¬†

Just gone.¬†

¬†¬†

Like he'd never been there at all. ¬†

¬†

Deke and I stumbled down the ridge, the storm howling around us, our boots slipping in the mud as we half-ran, half-fell toward Mill Creek. The town below was a mess of flashing lights, Black Briar vans, county sheriff cruisers, even a National Guard truck rolling in. They had the roads blocked off, the streets empty except for the occasional figure in a hazmat suit. The air smelled like rain and diesel, but underneath it, faint but unmistakable, was that metallic tang, the deep dark, seeping up through the cracks.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke grabbed my arm, pulling me behind the sagging remains of an old office building. His breath came in ragged gasps, but his eyes were sharp, calculating. ""We ain't got long,"" he wheezed. ""That thing‚Äôs still comin‚Äô. And Black Briar‚Äôs gonna lock this place down tighter than a drum once they realize what‚Äôs loose.""¬†

¬†¬†

I clutched the bag with the black tape. It felt heavier now, colder, like it was drinking in the fear around it. ""So what do we do? Burn it? Toss it down a mine shaft?""¬†

¬†¬†

Deke shook his head. ""Ain‚Äôt that simple. That tape‚Äôs just a piece of it. A symptom. You burn it, and it‚Äôll just find another way out. Another crack."" He wiped rainwater from his face. ""We gotta burn everything.""¬†

¬†¬†

I stared at him. ""The whole town?""¬†

¬†¬†

""No, you damn fool,"" he snapped. ""The source."" He pointed toward the ridge where we‚Äôd just come from, toward the old Hawk‚Äôs Nest tunnels, the Union Carbide vents, all those places where the deep dark had been poked and prodded and left to fester. ""We collapse it. Seal it for good. And we make sure Black Briar can‚Äôt just dig it back up when the dust settles.""¬†

¬†¬†

I thought of Earl. Of the way he‚Äôd looked in those last seconds, not scared, just tired. Tired of running. Tired of knowing.¬†

¬†¬†

""Alright,"" I said. ""How?""¬†

¬†¬†

Deke grinned, and for the first time, it wasn‚Äôt the grin of a paranoid old hermit. It was the grin of a man who‚Äôd been waiting his whole damn life for this fight.¬†

¬†¬†

""Follow me.""¬†

¬†¬†

Three Hours Later¬†

¬†¬†

The Mill Creek Gas & Go was abandoned when we broke in. The clerk had fled with everyone else when the containment alarms started blaring. Deke moved with practiced ease, grabbing jerry cans of diesel, bundles of road flares, and a dusty box of¬†sparklers from the back (""For festivals,"" he muttered, as if that explained anything).¬†

¬†¬†

Outside, the storm raged, but the real chaos was up at the old mine entrances. Black Briar had cordoned them off, their men in black tactical gear swarming like ants, but they weren‚Äôt prepared for what was coming.¬†

¬†¬†

We weren‚Äôt either.¬†

¬†¬†

The first tremor hit as we reached the ridge overlooking the main Hawk‚Äôs Nest access road. The ground shuddered underfoot, a deep, groaning vibration that had nothing to do with thunder. Down below, Black Briar agents scrambled, radios crackling.¬†

¬†¬†

Then the screaming started.¬†

¬†¬†

Not from the men. From the earth.¬†

¬†¬†

A sound like a thousand rocks grinding together tore through the valley, and then, movement. The ground near the sealed vent shaft bulged, then split, dirt and concrete crumbling inward. A familiar, sickly green glow pulsed from the fissure.¬†

¬†¬†

""It‚Äôs out,"" Deke whispered.¬†

¬†¬†

And then it was.¬†

¬†¬†

The entity, or something bigger, something hungrier, surged from the ruptured ground in a wave of shadow and static, the green eyes not pinpricks now but great, luminous pools, swirling like toxic storm clouds. The Black Briar men opened fire, their muzzle flashes lighting up the night, but the bullets did nothing. The thing absorbed them, the gunfire vanishing into the dark without so much as a ripple.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke didn‚Äôt hesitate. He tossed me a flare. ""Now or never, kid.""¬†

¬†¬†

We moved.¬†

¬†¬†¬†

We didn‚Äôt just burn the tunnels. We burned the records. The Black Briar vans. The old Union Carbide office with its filing cabinets full of lies. Deke knew where everything was, every hidden stash, every buried report. He‚Äôd been mapping it for years.¬†

¬†¬†

The explosions weren‚Äôt pretty. They weren‚Äôt clean. But they worked.¬†

¬†¬†

By dawn, the mountain was coughing up black smoke, the vents collapsing one by one under the weight of fire and fury. The entity shrieked, its form writhing as the flames licked at the edges of its darkness, driving it back into the cracks it had crawled from.¬†

¬†¬†

Black Briar tried to stop us. Some of them died. Some of them ran. Most of them just watched, their faces blank under their helmets, as the deep dark swallowed their men whole.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke and I stood on the ridge as the sun rose, the air thick with ash and the stink of burning diesel. The town below was in chaos, evacuations, news vans, the distant wail of federal sirens. But up here, for the first time in days, it was quiet.¬†

¬†¬†

""You think it‚Äôs gone?"" I asked, my voice raw.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke spat into the dirt. ""Nothin‚Äô like this ever really goes,"" he said. ""But it‚Äôs sealed. For now."" He glanced at me. ""They‚Äôll be back, though. Black Briar. Others like ‚Äòem. They always come back.""¬†

¬†¬†

I thought of Earl again. Of the way he‚Äôd looked at me before the end, like he‚Äôd already made his peace with it.¬†

¬†¬†

""Then we‚Äôll be ready,"" I said.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke grinned. ""Damn right we will.""¬†

¬†¬†

He tossed me the last flare.¬†

¬†¬†

I held onto it.¬†

¬†¬†

Epilogue: One Year Later¬†

¬†¬†

The official story was a gas leak. A tragic accident. A handful of dead, mostly Black Briar contractors, and Becker. The town got federal relief money. New roads. A shiny new data center where the old Video Vault used to be.¬†

¬†¬†

No one talked about the green lights. The hum. The way some of the rescue dogs had refused to go near certain patches of ground.¬†

¬†¬†

No one but us.¬†

¬†¬†

Deke‚Äôs ""retirement cabin"" up near Spruce Knob became our new base of operations. A little more fortified than the trailer. A little more off-grid. The walls were papered with maps, news clippings, and grainy photos of sinkholes that hadn‚Äôt been there the day before.¬†

¬†¬†

I kept the crowbar. And the tape, what was left of it, anyway. A melted, twisted husk, but still cold to the touch. Still humming, if you listened close enough.¬†

¬†¬†

Sometimes, late at night, when the wind howls just right, you can still hear it. Not just in the tape. In the ground. In the trees. A low, resonant vibration, like the mountain breathing.¬†

¬†¬†

Waiting.¬†

I'd heard about these perks before, but I never really paid attention to them until this trip. I ended up getting the Chase Sapphire Reserve, mainly because of the awesome travel benefits it offered, and the lounge access was a huge selling point.

The first time I used the lounge, I was in the Dallas airport, and it was such a game-changer. The staff was super friendly, there were free snacks (like actual good snacks, not just pretzels), and the atmosphere was so much more relaxing than sitting in the crowded terminal. I was able to take a shower, chill with a coffee, and get some work done without all the hustle and noise. It honestly made the whole travel experience so much smoother.

It wasn't just the convenience, either. The lounges felt like a little hidden gem you wouldn‚Äôt get with just a regular ticket. It was nice to be able to have access to quiet spaces and better food, especially when you're in the middle of a long day of travel. Honestly, I think it‚Äôs totally worth having a card with this kind of benefit.

1mei0f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mei0f4/appalachian_static_part_1/,Appalachian Static Part 1,"The fluorescent lights of Video Vault buzzed like angry hornets trapped in a tin can. Tuesday. Rain slicked the cracked asphalt outside, turning the Dollar General lot into a greasy smear. I shoved Hellraiser III back into its mangled box, another victim of Becker‚Äôs war on rewind buttons.¬†

¬†¬†

""Kid treats basic decency like a suggestion,"" I muttered to the empty horror aisle. ""Pure anarchy.""¬†

¬†¬†

The security monitors above the counter snapped. Not snow. Jagged, geometric static. For a split second, it locked in: The Nightjar‚Äôs Wing. That impossible symbol, looking less like a glitch and more like a brand seared onto reality. Then it dissolved back into frantic snow.¬†

¬†¬†

My phone buzzed against a fossilized Cheeto. WV DHS Alert: Unplanned Acoustic Anomaly Detected, Mill Creek Basin. Avoid Sustained Silence. Remain Calm.¬†

¬†¬†

I snorted. ""Avoid silence? Earl‚Äôs due for his three o‚Äôclock rant about fluoride and Freemasons stealing his mail. Silence ain‚Äôt happening."" I jabbed a finger at the monitor. ""And you? Knock off the spooky glitch act. It‚Äôs Tuesday. We‚Äôve got standards.""¬†

¬†¬†

The door chime clanged, harsh as a dropped hubcap. Becker stood framed in grey light, dripping onto the unwelcoming mat. He wasn‚Äôt just wet. He looked rinsed. Washed out, paper-white under the sickly fluorescents. Deep, bruised shadows hollowed his eyes. The smell hit me first. Burnt plastic. Ozone. Underneath, damp earth dug from under a rotten log, the kind that clings. A smell that sticks.¬†

¬†¬†

He didn‚Äôt look pissed. He looked hunted.¬†

¬†¬†

Becker: (Voice raw, thin, scraping gravel) Finch. Need to settle up.¬†

Me: Late fees? Hellraiser III? Kid, you owe me enough to buy Pinhead a new entourage. What‚Äôve you got? Bartering with that three-legged possum again?¬†

Becker: (Fumbling frantically in his soaked hoodie pocket, eyes darting past me to the monitors) No. No possums. This. Payment. Take it. Just take it. Please.¬†

¬†¬†

He slammed it down hard beside Pinhead‚Äôs serene judgment. A matte black cassette. No label. It didn‚Äôt reflect light; it consumed it. Denser than plastic had any right to be. Wrong. Like finding a piece of cold mountain bedrock on the counter.¬†

¬†¬†

I stared at it. Then at Becker‚Äôs strained face. The chemical reek hung heavy.¬†

¬†¬†

Me: What is this, Becker? Your audition tape for Toxic Avenger? Found some glowing creek sludge?¬†

Becker: (Shaking his head violently, rainwater flying) No! Just take it. Consider us square. For everything. Please, Finch. Shelter in place. They mean it this time. Shelter in place!¬†

¬†¬†

He stumbled backwards out the door, vanishing into the downpour. The chime clanged again, a discordant echo.¬†

¬†¬†

I looked down at the black tape. Cold. Unnaturally cold. Heavy. A piece of the deep dark places.¬†

¬†¬†

""Alright,"" I sighed, picking it up. The cold seeped into my fingers. ""Becker‚Äôs descent into madness. Let‚Äôs see what flavor of weird this is."" My thumb brushed its light-swallowing surface. A faint hum vibrated against my skin. Or maybe the lights were finally dying. Outside, rain hammered the tin roof like tiny fists. My phone buzzed. Another alert? Earl? The universe calling me an idiot? Probably both.¬†

¬†¬†

I turned the tape over. The cold deepened. The Nightjar‚Äôs Wing pulsed faintly behind my eyelids. Becker‚Äôs terror echoed. Shelter in place.¬†

¬†¬†

""Too late for that,"" I muttered, heading for the back room and the ancient JVC. ""Way too late."" The deep hum from the monitors seemed to swell. The black tape felt heavier, hungrier, with every step towards the back room door.¬†

¬†¬†

The black tape sat heavy in my hand. Cold seeped into my bones, deeper than the store‚Äôs damp chill. Becker‚Äôs terror lingered like ozone. Shelter in place. His voice scraped in my memory.¬†

¬†¬†

""Yeah, right, kid,"" I muttered, the words thin. ""Like anywhere‚Äôs safe now.""¬†

¬†¬†

The lights buzzed louder, angrier. The monitors flickered agitated snow. The DHS alert felt like a death warrant confirmation.¬†

¬†¬†

Instinct screamed. Not the JVC. Not yet. I grabbed the ancient landline, the one smelling of dust and defeat. Dialed Earl. It rang twice, tinny and harsh.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl: (Crackly, rain and engine noise behind him) Finch? Sounds like you‚Äôre callin‚Äô from the bottom of a well. Or hell.¬†

Me: Earl. Get to the Vault. Now. Bring something stronger than your ditch weed. Maybe a crowbar.¬†

Earl: Crowbar? You finally snap over late fees? Mrs. Gunderson push too hard? Was it Becker? Kid‚Äôs overdue on Hellraiser again.¬†

Me: Becker was just here. Left something. Wrong. He looked chewed up, Earl. Spat out. Smelled like burnt wires and a wet grave.¬†

Earl: (Silence. The background noise faded) Wet graves? Finch, you huffin‚Äô VCR cleaner?¬†

Me: I wish. No. A tape. Black. No label. Feels like ten pounds of bad news straight from a nightmare. Begged me to take it. Said ‚Äòshelter in place‚Äô like it mattered.¬†

Earl: (Longer silence. His voice dropped, the sarcasm gone) Black tape? You touched it?¬†

Me: Yeah. Cold. Like freezer burn on your soul.¬†

Earl: ...Alright. Don‚Äôt be stupid. Don‚Äôt play it. Don‚Äôt even look at it sideways. Put it somewhere. I‚Äôm comin‚Äô. Five minutes. Lock the damn door.¬†

¬†¬†

He hung up. The dial tone buzzed flatline. I placed the black cassette carefully on the counter. It looked like a hole in the world. I half-expected frost.¬†

¬†¬†

The minutes crawled. Rain drummed harder. Every creak was a footstep. Every flicker a warning. I aggressively alphabetized ""Comedy"" (Adam Sandler and forgotten rom-coms). Pointless, but moving felt better than standing still, feeling watched.¬†

¬†¬†

The door chime rattled. Earl stood there, rain plastering his hair, hunched under soaked flannel. A lumpy canvas bag over his shoulder. He didn‚Äôt step in. His eyes scanned the store like a trapper checking for snares. They locked on the black tape.¬†

¬†¬†

""Lock it,"" he ordered, voice low.¬†

¬†¬†

I fumbled the deadbolt. The click echoed. Earl stepped in, shaking water off. He smelled like wet wool, cheap tobacco, and underneath it, something old. Ozone. Wet stone. Like Becker‚Äôs smell, but weathered, seeped into the fabric of him, like the scent of deep mineshafts clinging to old miners' clothes. He dropped the bag with a heavy thud. His eyes stayed fixed on the tape.¬†

¬†¬†

""Describe it,"" he commanded, not moving closer. ""Exactly.""¬†

¬†¬†

I did. The matte black. The unnatural weight. The cold. Becker‚Äôs terror. The smell. The light-eating darkness.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl nodded slowly, a muscle ticking in his jaw. He finally looked away, scanning the store, the flickering monitors, the rain. ""Shelter in place,"" he murmured. ""They only say that when somethin‚Äôs gotten out. When the fences ain‚Äôt holdin‚Äô.‚Äù¬†

¬†¬†

""They?"" I pressed. ""DHS? County? The clean-van guys?""¬†

¬†¬†

He didn‚Äôt answer directly. Unzipping the bag, he pulled out a dented thermos. ""Coffee. Strong. Mixed with somethin‚Äô stronger."" He poured a capful, pushed it my way. ""Drink. You look like you seen the devil. Or worse.""¬†

¬†¬†

I drank. Hot, bitter, cut with a sharp herbal burn. It warmed a path through the cold dread. Earl knocked his back.¬†

¬†¬†

""Black Briar,"" he finally said, the name dropping heavy. ""Heard of ‚Äòem?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Security? Vans too clean?""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl barked a humorless laugh. ""Security. Yeah. Like callin' a copperhead a garden hose. They handle‚Ä¶ containment. For the folks who own the fences. The ones who dug too deep back in the day, in places like Hawk‚Äôs Nest. Places where the rock remembers the pain. Where the air ain‚Äôt right. Where things‚Ä¶ linger."" He gestured vaguely towards the rain-hidden hills. ""My paw-paw, he worked Hawk‚Äôs Nest before the silicosis took him slow. Didn‚Äôt just cough dust. Talked about noises. Shapes in the tunnels after the blasts. Whispers on the air that weren‚Äôt air. Said the company men in suits that weren‚Äôt company came after, sealing sections off. Payin‚Äô folks to forget. Black Briar‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the grandsons of those suits. Handlin‚Äô what shouldn‚Äôt have been woken up."" His eyes flicked back to the black tape. ""That‚Ä¶ looks like somethin‚Äô Black Briar would use. Or somethin‚Äô they‚Äôd lose.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Use? For what?""¬†

¬†¬†

""Recordin'. Monitorin'. Could be bait."" Earl took a step closer, nostrils flaring like a hound on scent. ""That stink on Becker? It's baked into this thing. Like he hauled it straight outta one of their holes."" His eyes locked onto mine, hard as flint. ""If Black Briar lost this tape... or if somethin' down there took it back... they'll come huntin'. Meaner than a trapped coyote. And they won't blink at flattenin' whoever's standin' on top of it.""¬†

¬†¬†

The implications hit. Becker, terrified, dumping this thing like hot coals. Evidence. Or a curse passed on.¬†

¬†¬†

My phone buzzed. Not a text. The shrill, blaring siren of a WV DHS EMERGENCY ALERT.¬†

¬†¬†

We froze.¬†

¬†¬†

The screen blared red:¬†

SHELTER IN PLACE IMMEDIATE¬†

LOCATION: MILL CREEK CROSSROADS & SURROUNDING AREA¬†

REASON: CONTAINMENT PROTOCOL DELTA INITIATED. UNAUTHORIZED BIOHAZARD RELEASE.¬†

REMAIN INDOORS. SEAL WINDOWS/DOORS. DISREGARD ALL OUTSIDE MOVEMENT. AWAIT OFFICIAL CONTAINMENT TEAM. REMAIN CALM.¬†

¬†¬†

""Containment Protocol Delta,"" Earl breathed, face paling. ""Biohazard release."" He looked from the alert to the tape, then to the front. ""That ain‚Äôt gas, Finch. That‚Äôs a breach. Something got loose they couldn‚Äôt cap.""¬†

¬†¬†

As if summoned, the lights dipped violently, plunging us into darkness before surging back, harsher. The buzzing climbed to a skull-scraping whine. The security monitors didn‚Äôt flicker.¬†

¬†¬†

They went black.¬†

¬†¬†

All of them.¬†

¬†¬†

Utter, silent darkness on every screen.¬†

¬†¬†

Then, one by one, they flickered back on.¬†

¬†¬†

Not the parking lot. Not the aisles.¬†

¬†¬†

A high-up view. Looking down at the counter. At us. Grainy, black and white, distorted‚Ä¶ but unmistakably Video Vault. Right now. From the ceiling camera.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl and I stood frozen, staring up at our own grainy ghosts. The camera was fixed on Aisle 3.¬†

¬†¬†

But in the flickering image, on the edge, between ""Cult Classics"" and ""Creature Features,"" a shape resolved from the static. Hunched. Angular. Utterly still.¬†

¬†¬†¬†

Its head, a rough, dark silhouette, was tilted upwards. Towards the camera lens.¬†

¬†¬†

Two pinpricks of sickly, greenish-yellow light ignited in the shadow. Unblinking. Fixed on the screen. Fixed on the tiny, flickering images of us.¬†

¬†¬†

The piercing whine dropped into that deep, resonant hum from the tape. It vibrated the floor, syncing with my frantic heartbeat. The Shelter in Place alert screamed from my phone, useless against the impossible dread solidifying in the room.¬†

¬†¬†

On the monitor, the thing in Aisle 3 didn‚Äôt move. It just watched. The green eyes burned like toxic stars in the screen's gloom. The hum wasn't just sound anymore. It was pressure. A physical weight pushing down on the air, thick as the wet wool smell clinging to Earl. My own heartbeat thudded in my ears, a frantic counterpoint to that deep, resonant drone. The Shelter in Place alert screamed its digital panic, utterly dwarfed by the silent, green-eyed stare burning from the security monitors.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt breathe. He was carved from the same damp stone as the hills, eyes locked on the tiny, flickering image. That gaze, through the lens, through the screen, felt like ice water trickling down my spine.¬†

¬†¬†

""Earl..."" My voice was a dry rasp, swallowed by the hum. ""It‚Äôs watching.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Not just watchin‚Äô,"" Earl breathed, his voice low and stripped bare. ""Learnin‚Äô. Sizin‚Äô us up. Seein‚Äô how scared we are."" He finally tore his eyes away, looking at me. The raw fear there was worse than the thing on the monitor. Earl wasn‚Äôt scared of much. ""Black Briar don‚Äôt cry Delta for squirrels, Finch. Means somethin‚Äô big got loose. Somethin‚Äô they can‚Äôt just hose down or dynamite shut like a bad vein.""¬†

¬†¬†

The implication hung in the ozone-tinged air. Becker brought the breach. Or the breach followed him. The black rectangle sat on the counter like a cursed mountain stone, radiating cold malice.¬†

¬†¬†

On the monitor, the hunched shape remained motionless. The twin green points unwavering. Studying.¬†

¬†¬†

""What do we do?"" The question felt stupid, desperate. Seal windows? Against that? Wait for Black Briar to torch the place?¬†

¬†¬†

""Seal up?"" Earl scoffed, a harsh, humorless sound. ""Against whatever crawled outta them old tunnels? Look at it. You think Sheetrock and a deadbolt gonna stop somethin‚Äô that walks through rock?"" He jerked his thumb towards the back room. ""That JVC. That tape. That‚Äôs the wound Becker opened. This place is bleedin‚Äô bad air now.""¬†

¬†¬†

The lights flickered violently, the buzz climbing back to a skull-scraping whine. On the monitor bank, the image stuttered. For a split second, the view changed. Not Aisle 3. It was the back room. Grainy, distorted. The ancient JVC. The pile of dead remotes. The dark CRT. The perspective from the camera inside the back room door.¬†

¬†¬†

Then it snapped back to Aisle 3. The angular shape hadn‚Äôt moved. But the green lights‚Ä¶ had they flared?¬†

¬†¬†

""Did you see?"" I choked. ""The back room...""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl nodded grimly. ""It‚Äôs mappin‚Äô. Movin‚Äô its sight. Or worse‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs more than one already here."" He took a slow step towards the counter, towards his canvas bag. He unzipped it fully. Inside: a heavy Maglite, a worn leather roll, and a small, cloth-wrapped bundle smelling of gunpowder and bitter mountain herbs. He pulled out the Maglite, hefting it.¬†

¬†¬†

""Containment team ain‚Äôt comin‚Äô to rescue, Finch,"" he said, voice urgent. ""They‚Äôre comin‚Äô to scorch earth. Burn it clean. Us included. Just loose ends in a ‚Äòbiohazard‚Äô report."" He nodded at the black tape. ""That thing? That‚Äôs the proof they wanna erase. Becker knew. That‚Äôs why he ran. Why he dumped it here."" He flicked the Maglite on. The beam cut the gloom, landing on the black cassette. It seemed to swallow the light. ""We gotta ditch it. Before they get here. Or before it decides playtime‚Äôs over.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Ditch it? How? Throw it out? It feels‚Ä¶ alive, Earl. Wrong. You think it‚Äôll just let go?""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl‚Äôs eyes darted to the monitors. The green lights still fixed. Unblinking. ""Maybe not ditch,"" he murmured, a dangerous edge in his voice. ""Destroy it. Fry it. Melt it down to slag."" He pointed to the back room door. ""That old furnace closet‚Ä¶ sounds like a dragon coughin‚Äô. Gets hotter than a mine fire.""¬†

¬†¬†

The ancient oil furnace. A relic. It roared, radiating heat through its thin metal door. Insane. Suicidal.¬†

¬†¬†

""It‚Äôs sealed,"" I argued, panic rising. ""The door‚Äôs warped shut! That furnace could blow!""¬†

¬†¬†

""Better‚Äôn Black Briar‚Äôs napalm,"" Earl shot back. ""Or lettin‚Äô that finish its tour."" He moved slowly towards the back room door, beam on the floor. ""Grab somethin‚Äô. Crowbar. Fire extinguisher. Heavy. We gotta pry that closet open.""¬†

¬†¬†

I lunged for the crowbar under overdue notices, cold steel shocking my sweaty palm. As I grabbed it, my gaze swept the monitors.¬†

¬†¬†

The image hadn‚Äôt changed. The hunched shape. The green eyes.¬†

¬†¬†

But on the parking lot feed, pure static flickered. Resolved. Not the lot. Another internal view. High angle. Looking down at the front counter. Where the black tape sat. Where Earl and I had stood.¬†

¬†¬†

No camera there.¬†

¬†¬†

Standing beside the counter, half-obscured by static, was another angular silhouette. Slightly taller. Same rough, light-eating surface. Same two pinpricks of sickly green light, angled not at the counter, but towards the back room door.¬†

¬†¬†

Where Earl was reaching for the handle.¬†

¬†¬†

""EARL!"" The scream tore raw from my throat. ""LOOK!""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl froze, hand inches from the knob. He followed my stare to the parking lot monitor. Saw it. The second shape. Watching the door. Waiting.¬†

¬†¬†

The deep hum surged, vibrating the floor violently. Lights flickered wildly, plunging us into strobing darkness. In the chaotic flashes, the monitors showed rapid glimpses:¬†

¬†¬†

Aisle 3: The first shape taking a single, jerky step forward.¬†

¬†¬†

Front Counter: The second shape turning its head, green eyes swiveling towards the camera, towards us.¬†

¬†¬†

Parking Lot: Static resolving into rain-lashed asphalt‚Ä¶ and a sleek, blindingly white Black Briar Security van silently blocking the exit. Doors opening.¬†

¬†¬†

The Shelter in Place alert screamed: REMAIN CALM. AWAIT CONTAINMENT TEAM.¬†

¬†¬†

Calm was gone. The thing in Aisle 3 moved. The thing by the counter saw us. Black Briar was here. The tape sat like a malevolent heart. The furnace door remained shut. Trapped between the breach and the burn squad, crowbar in hand, Earl‚Äôs nerve fraying. The hum vibrated my teeth. The green eyes watched from every screen. ¬†

¬†

The crowbar‚Äôs cold steel bit into my palm. Useless weight against the deeper chill radiating from the black tape on the counter, or the ice flooding my veins. On the monitors, chaos strobed:¬†

¬†¬†

Aisle 3: The first hunched shape lurched forward another jerky step. Pinprick green eyes fixed on the camera. Fixed on us.¬†

¬†¬†

Front Counter: The second angular silhouette by the register turned its head with a stutter-stop motion. Those same sickly green lights swiveled, locking onto the back room door. Onto Earl, frozen with his hand hovering over the knob.¬†

¬†¬†

Parking Lot: Rain sheeting down, washing over the blinding white hull of the Black Briar van. Four figures in matte-black, full-face respirators and bulky, unmarked tactical gear already on the asphalt, moving with unnerving silence and precision towards Video Vault's entrance. A fifth figure remained by the van, holding something that looked like a cross between a radar dish and a flamethrower nozzle.¬†

¬†¬†

The deep, resonant hum surged, vibrating the floorboards so hard dust rained from the ceiling tiles. The lights flickered violently, plunging us into near-total darkness for terrifying seconds before snapping back on, harsher, buzzing like a swarm trapped in glass. The Shelter in Place alert screamed its digital panic from my phone, now almost drowned out.¬†

¬†¬†

""CONTAINMENT TEAM ON SITE,"" a synthesized, emotionless voice boomed from outside, amplified, cutting through the rain and the siren. ""REMAIN WHERE YOU ARE. DO NOT INTERFERE.""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl ripped his hand back from the doorknob like it was electrified. He stumbled back into the main store, face ashen under the strobing fluorescents. His eyes darted between the monitors showing the approaching Black Briar goons and the one showing the second entity by the counter, its green gaze now fixed on the front door.¬†

¬†¬†

""Interfere?"" Earl spat, terror and fury warping his voice. ""They ain't here for us, Finch. We're loose ends. Witnesses to their dirty laundry."" He pointed a shaking finger at the black tape. ""They want that back in their hole. They'll burn this place to cinders to get it and erase the trail. Us included.""¬†

¬†¬†

On the Aisle 3 monitor, the first entity took another step. It was nearing the end of the aisle. Closer to the open space near the counter. Closer to us.¬†

¬†¬†

The heavy THUMP on the front door made us both flinch. Not a knock. A single, authoritative impact, testing the frame‚Äôs strength.¬†

¬†¬†

""OPEN THE DOOR."" The amplified voice was flat. Commanding. Utterly devoid of humanity. ""COMPLY FOR YOUR SAFETY.""¬†

¬†¬†

""My safety?"" I choked out, gripping the crowbar tighter. ""They‚Äôve got a goddamn flamethrower pointed at the door, Earl!""¬†

¬†¬†

Earl‚Äôs eyes were wild, scanning the cramped store. The back room: dead end. The front door: about to be breached. The furnace plan: ashes. He lunged for the canvas bag, yanking out the cloth-wrapped bundle. He tore it open, revealing three crude, fist-sized lumps wrapped in waxed paper and twine. The smell of sulfur and bitter herbs, ginseng root and something acrid like devil's shoestring, filled the small space.¬†

¬†¬†

""Distractions,"" he hissed, shoving one into my free hand. It was heavy, cold, and greasy. ""Light the fuse, throw it hard towards the horror section, run like hell for the back room. Don't look back. Might buy us seconds. Ground pepper, flash powder, a pinch of saltpeter, old tricks for spookin' things that ain't quite solid yet.""¬†

¬†¬†

""Seconds from what?"" Panic clawed at my throat. ""Them?"" I gestured to the monitors. ""Or them?"" I pointed at the door.¬†

¬†¬†

""Does it matter?"" Earl rasped, pulling a battered Zippo from his pocket. His hands trembled violently as he flicked it open. The small flame looked pitiful against the encroaching dread. ""Just be ready to bolt when it pops. Don't think. Just run.""¬†

¬†¬†

Another heavy THUMP on the door. Louder. Wood splintered around the deadbolt. On the monitor, the two Black Briar operatives braced, raising compact, blocky weapons that hummed with a low, predatory whine.¬†

¬†¬†

On the other monitors:¬†

¬†¬†

The entity in Aisle 3 was now fully visible. Hunched, maybe five feet tall, its surface a rough, non-reflective black that seemed to drink the light. Limbs too long, too thin, ending in sharp, articulated points. The green eyes burned like toxic stars in its faceless head. It didn't advance further. It watched the front door. Waiting.¬†

¬†¬†

The entity by the counter mirrored its stance. Utterly still. Green eyes fixed on the entrance.¬†

¬†¬†

They weren't focused on us anymore. The bigger disturbance was outside. The breach was meeting the containment. We were just rats in the walls.¬†

¬†¬†

""Now, Finch!"" Earl yelled, touching the Zippo's flame to the short, braided fuse on his bundle. It sparked, sizzled, and began burning with alarming speed, emitting thick, acrid smoke. He drew his arm back, aiming for the space near the Cult Classics shelf. ""LIGHT IT! THROW!""¬†

¬†¬†

My fingers fumbled. The Zippo felt alien. The fuse seemed impossibly short. The thumping became a rhythmic BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. Wood splintered loudly. The Black Briar agent with the flamer-nozzle device raised it, aiming through the door.¬†

¬†¬†

The entity in Aisle 3 tilted its head, a sharp, bird-like motion. The green eyes flared, casting sickly light on the shelves nearby.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl's fuse was halfway gone. He hurled his bundle in a high arc towards the horror section. ""FINCH! NOW!""¬†

¬†¬†

I touched the flame to my fuse. It caught instantly, spitting angry sparks. I didn't aim. I chucked it blindly towards the front of the store, towards the shuddering door and the waiting entity near the counter, then dove behind the relative cover of the checkout counter, dragging Earl down with me. He landed hard, the breath knocked out of him.¬†

¬†¬†

The world didn't explode with fire. It detonated with sound and light.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl's bundle detonated near the horror shelves with a deafening POP! that shook the building. A concussive wave of force slammed through the air, followed by an eye-searing flare of pure, magnesium-white light that burned through my closed eyelids. The shockwave rattled the shelves violently; tapes cascaded down like plastic shrapnel. My bundle landed near the front door and erupted a split-second later with another POP! and blinding flash, filling the front of the store with searing light and thick, choking, sulfurous smoke.¬†

¬†¬†

A hellish chorus erupted. High-pitched, shrieking electronic feedback tore from the security monitors, mingling with synthesized shouts of surprise and alarm from outside. The rhythmic pounding on the door stopped dead. The monitors showed nothing but static and overwhelming white glare.¬†

¬†¬†

The deep hum from the entities spiked into a shriek of pure dissonance that vibrated the counter I was pressed against, rattling my teeth. The strobing lights cut out completely, plunging Video Vault into near-total darkness, lit only by the dying, sputtering embers of Earl's flashbangs and the faint, hellish green glow emanating from where the entities had been standing.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl was already moving, scrambling on hands and knees towards the back room, coughing violently. ""GO! GO! MOVE! NOW!""¬†

¬†¬†

I scrambled after him, lungs burning from the acrid smoke, ears ringing, vision swimming with purple afterimages. Behind us, in the swirling, smoke-choked gloom near the front, the piercing green lights reappeared, not two pairs, but four. They moved erratically, swirling with furious speed through the haze like enraged fireflies. The electronic shrieking continued, now mixed with guttural, clicking sounds that scraped against my nerves.¬†

¬†¬†

We burst through the back room door. Earl slammed it shut behind us, fumbling for the flimsy interior bolt. It slid home with a pathetic click. He leaned against the door, chest heaving, face slick with sweat and soot.¬†

¬†¬†

""Won't hold,"" he gasped. ""Not against them. Not against Black Briar‚Äôs breaching tools. Not for long.""¬†

¬†¬†

The back room felt claustrophobic, marginally safer only because it was smaller, darker. The ancient JVC sat silently on the table, a mute witness. The black tape was still out front, on the counter, in the heart of the chaos. The furnace closet door remained warped, impassable, a mocking monument to a failed plan.¬†

¬†¬†

From the main store, sounds of conflict erupted. Not gunfire. Something worse. A high-pitched, oscillating WHINE that set my fillings on edge, punctuated by concussive THUD sounds and the continued, furious shrieking clicks of the entities. The Black Briar team was inside. They‚Äôd breached. And they‚Äôd walked straight into the uncanny they were supposed to contain.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl pressed his ear to the thin door. His face, lit by the dim, erratic glow filtering under it, was grim. ""They're tanglin' with ‚Äòem,"" he whispered hoarsely. ""Black Briar and‚Ä¶ them. Buyin‚Äô us time. Not much. That whine‚Ä¶ sounds like their sonic prodders. Meant to disrupt, not kill. Won‚Äôt stop those things for long.""¬†

¬†¬†

He looked around the cramped space, his eyes landing on the small, high, grime-coated window near the ceiling. Barely big enough to squeeze through, leading to the narrow, rain-lashed alley behind the store. ""Only way out,"" he said, pointing. ""Gotta go. Now. Before whoever wins that fight remembers the rats in the walls.""¬†

¬†¬†

The window was old, the frame swollen, painted shut a dozen times over. Outside, the rain still lashed down. The Shelter in Place alert still screamed its futile warning, muffled now. The sounds of the otherworldly skirmish, the whines, the thuds, the shrieks, were intensifying. Getting closer. Something heavy crashed into a shelf out front, followed by a guttural electronic scream that cut off abruptly.¬†

¬†¬†

The tape was still out there. The breach was still open. Our only escape was a painted-shut window leading into the storm-lashed alley, with God-knew-what, Black Briar patrols, more entities, or just the suffocating weight of the government‚Äôs secret war, waiting on the other side. The cold from the tape seemed to have seeped into the very air of the back room, and the green eyes, though unseen now, felt like they were still watching from the static-filled dark beyond the door. Waiting for the next desperate move. The crowbar felt suddenly very heavy in my hand, and very, very small. ¬†

¬†

The painted window frame fought like a rusted coffin lid. Earl braced his boots against the wall, veins bulging in his neck as he heaved against the crowbar jammed under the swollen wood. Rainwater streamed down the filthy glass, blurring the dark alley beyond into a wet smear of brick and overflowing dumpsters. Each grunt from Earl was punctuated by the cacophony from the store: the shriek-whine of Black Briar weapons, the guttural thuds of impacts, and the unnerving, chittering clicks of the entities.¬†

¬†¬†

""Almost... got it..."" Earl gasped. With a final, splintering crack, the bottom corner of the window frame tore loose. Cold, rain-lashed air blasted into the cramped back room, carrying the smell of wet asphalt, rotting garbage, and the faint, ever-present tang of coal dust that clung to Mill Creek like a ghost. ""You first, Finch! Go!""¬†

¬†¬†

No time for debate. I shoved the crowbar into my belt, grabbed the gritty windowsill, and hauled myself up. The opening was tight, scraping skin off my ribs as I wriggled through headfirst. I landed hard on slick concrete, the impact jarring my knees. Rain instantly plastered my hair to my skull, icy water trickling down my collar. The alley was narrow, canyoned by the backs of the Video Vault and the shuttered hardware store next door. One flickering security light above a rusted dumpster cast long, dancing shadows.¬†

¬†¬†

Earl followed, landing with a heavier thud and a pained grunt. He immediately hunched over, hands on knees, wheezing. ""Damn... lungs ain't... what they used to be..."" he rasped. ""Used to chase deer up Spruce Knob... now a damn window... near kills me."" His flannel was dark with rain and sweat, plastered to his broad back. The canvas bag was still slung over his shoulder, lumpy and ominous.¬†

¬†¬†

From inside the Video Vault, a sound cut through the rain, a high-frequency electronic screech followed by a wet, crunching pop, then silence. Utter silence. Even the Shelter in Place alert on my abandoned phone had stopped. The sudden quiet was more terrifying than the noise.¬†

¬†¬†

""They silenced one,"" Earl whispered, straightening up with effort, his eyes wide and reflecting the dumpster light. ""Or it silenced them. Either way... bad news. We gotta move."" He pointed down the alley towards the deeper darkness where it met the woods encroaching on the town's edge. ""Creek path. Behind the old Baptist church. Only way they won't have eyes on.""",2,1754007474.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

If I‚Äôm honest I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm writing this. Maybe it‚Äôs just to get things off my chest, to process something that I still can‚Äôt believe happened. It doesn‚Äôt matter to me if you believe me. Heck, I still don‚Äôt believe me.¬†

I guess I should start by explaining that I‚Äôm a writer, of sorts at least. Probably nothing that you‚Äôve read unless you like reading paranormal research. I tried to write stories for a while, but people didn‚Äôt seem to be as interested in fantasy as they used to be. Anyway, since selling my own stories didn‚Äôt work, I managed to find a podcast that wanted help researching local legends, cryptid encounters, ghost sightings, the whole nine yards. Have you ever heard the expression that truth is stranger than fiction? I never believed it until I started listening to people‚Äôs stories. I mean, some of them were obviously hoaxes, but others rang true. Just look at all of the stories people tell about bigfoot, or about ghosts. If even one of them is true‚Ä¶ well, if even one of them is true then most of us will have to start looking at reality in a whole new light.¬†

New England is an odd place and is no stranger to odd things. It is steeped in history and legend, though you wouldn‚Äôt know it by talking to the locals. You really have to dig to find the personal stories, and even then, if people don‚Äôt already know and trust you, you still might end up running into walls. People don‚Äôt often talk about the strange things that happen here, but if you are lucky enough to loosen some tongues, you might find out why Lovecraft based most of his stories here.

Have you ever heard the story of Betty and Barney Hill? They were among the first modern alien abductees, at least according to their story, and it happened right here where I live in New Hampshire. Ever since then, the people here have been having encounters with strange things in the sky, the woods, even the water. The stories didn‚Äôt start with Betty and Barney either. Even the Native American tribes have legends of odd things dating back to their creation myths.

I had a contact near the Connecticut River, not too far from the Hill abduction site. He‚Äôd been hinting for months that he had a story to tell, and he‚Äôd finally agreed to meet with me to tell me the story face to face. It was a rainy night and I was still new to the area. The town wasn‚Äôt far from Hanover, home to the Ivy League halls of Dartmouth College, and I had expected a more urban area, but the deeper I went into the New Hampshire hills, the darker the woods became. Rain sheeted down and before long I had slowed to a crawl, struggling to see through the dark and damp.

Light flashed and I yelled as a massive pine fell with a crash that seemed to bounce my old car‚Äôs wheels right off of the ground. I slammed the brakes, sending the car into a spin as it hit the thick branches. Glass shattered and I felt a sting on the side of my face as the seatbelt jarred my shoulder. In the same instant there was a bang and the airbag hit me full force. I blacked out for a moment or two and then began to fade in and out of consciousness. Rain pelted on my face and then there were cool hands on my arms and eyes that faded in and out of my vision, silvery golden eyes that shimmered and glowed in the dark. A door opened in the dark, spilling light out into the night, but the light was cold and as white as bone.

‚ÄúThere now,‚Äù said a voice as I was pulled inside. The bright light faded until only the eyes were left. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt this better?‚Äù

I sat up with a jolt, looking around the strange room in shock.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù exclaimed the voice that sounded like music. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre awake.‚Äù

A youngish woman set her book aside and left her chair to hover over the couch and rest a hand on my forehead. ‚ÄúHow do you feel? You took quite a bump to the head.‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh‚Ä¶‚Äù I stopped, swallowing nervously as she pushed me gently back to the cushions. ‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what happened?‚Äù

Her grey eyes narrowed and she cocked her head. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt remember?‚Äù

I tried not to star as she stood back up and returned to her seat, her long, raven hair drifting around her shoulders.

‚ÄúI remember the tree falling and not much else,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúHow did you even get me up here?‚Äù

The girl raised her slender arms, flexing the muscles beneath her red blouse with a wink. ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt think I could have gotten you up here alone?‚Äù She laughed. ‚ÄúMy butler carried you up here for me. You‚Äôre lucky we saw you pass by, otherwise you might still be stuck in your car.‚Äù

I groaned and covered my face with my hands. ‚ÄúThanks. I don‚Äôt think there are many people who would invite a stranger in like this.‚Äù

The girl raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWell, you aren‚Äôt a murderer are you, Mr. Hale?‚Äù

I sputtered for a moment. ‚ÄúWhat? No, I‚Äôm just a writer! I wouldn‚Äôt hurt anyone.‚Äù I stopped, staring at my odd host. ‚ÄúHow did you know my name?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found your wallet,‚Äù she replied. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs with your clothes in the laundry room.‚Äù

My eyes widened as I suddenly realized that I was dressed in someone else‚Äôs clothes, a simple t-shirt and soft pants that were at least a size too large.¬†

‚ÄúI had you dressed in my late husband‚Äôs clothes,‚Äù she explained, seemingly amused at my discomfort. You‚Äôre lucky we have generators here, or your clothes would still be sopping went in the kitchen sink.‚Äù Her musical laugh rang out as she flashed a slight smile. ‚ÄúAs much as I might dream about living in a castle, I‚Äôd be lying if I said I wasn‚Äôt fond of modern conveniences.‚Äù¬†

¬†I pulled the blanket that I‚Äôd been given over myself, unnerved by the idea of being dressed and undressed at the behest of this strange woman, butler or no. It didn‚Äôt help that she was one of the most beautiful creatures that I‚Äôd ever seen, with perfect, milky skin, dark hair and grey eyes that almost seemed to match the room‚Äôs wallpaper. I groaned as the motion of pulling the blanket to my chin made my head throb, a sudden and severe reminder that I‚Äôd been in an accident.¬†

‚ÄúThanks again for pulling me out,‚Äù I said, suddenly feeling very tired and dizzy. ‚ÄúDid you already call an ambulance?‚Äù

She was at my side in an instant, her cool, almost cold fingers soothing the ache in my skull. ‚ÄúMy butler is quite good at first aid,‚Äù she said gently. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have a concussion, but you are quite badly bruised. Even if the phone lines were working, I‚Äôm afraid nothing would make it out here until the storm passes and the roads are cleared.‚Äù

Rain tapped loudly on the window panes as she went to the door, dimming the room lights as she went. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll sleep in peace here tonight.‚Äù

It was as if her words were a drug, injected directly into the vein. The last thing I saw before falling into slumber was a final flash of her eyes.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù I asked as my eyes closed.

‚ÄúEliza. Eliza Bates. Sleep now Mr. Hale.‚Äù

¬†

\* \* \*

¬†

When I woke up it was still raining. The thunder of a downpour had ended, replaced by a steady pitter pat against the roof and the window pane. Someone, the butler I supposed, had left a small table with a covered plate and a thermos that smelled like fresh coffee. In the sunlight I could see the room, little more than a sitting room really. The couch I was on, Eliza‚Äôs chair, and an oversized writing desk in the corner were the only pieces of furniture and there were bookcases covering every empty space on the wall. I climbed unsteadily to my feet and went to the window, pulling aside the curtain. To my surprise the road wasn‚Äôt far away, less than a hundred yards from the house. I could even see my car, somehow pulled to the side of the road and out of the way of any road work vehicles.¬†

As I turned away from the window I bumped my knee on a table and stifled a yell of pain as an old picture fell to the floor.¬†

‚ÄúStupid table,‚Äù I grumbled as I picked it up.¬† The glass shifted and the faded photo slipped out, fluttering as it landed back on the floor. I rolled my eyes and snatched it back up. ‚ÄúStupid picture. Stupid knees always getting in the way.‚Äù

Handwritten letters on the back of the old picture caught my eye and I stopped, reading out loud to myself.

‚ÄúIt is strange to write in English,‚Äù it read in an attractive hand. ‚ÄúBut as an American I suppose I must get used to it. Saying goodbye to my name and my home is hard, but Elizabeth Bathory is already long dead and her home is a ruin. Eliza Bates‚Ä¶ maybe it is a name I could get used to.‚Äù

I blinked and looked at the picture, an ancient photo of a woman standing at Staten Island.¬†

‚ÄúElizabeth Bathory,‚Äù I muttered, wondering why the name seemed so familiar and why the woman in the picture looked like my host. ‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶ Eliza, you aged well.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you found my grandmother‚Äôs¬† immigration picture did you?‚Äù

I yelped and nearly dropped the picture. Eliza chuckled and took it from me, expertly placing it back in the frame.

‚ÄúSurprised at the resemblance?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a family curse I suppose‚Ä¶ we all look like our mothers.‚Äù She stared at the picture with what might have been fondness. ‚ÄúHer butler took this picture on the day she arrived from Hungary. He was my Hubert‚Äôs grandfather actually, interestingly enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve heard that name before,‚Äù I said as I went back to the couch. ‚ÄúElizabeth Bathory.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an old Hungarian name,‚Äù she said. She cocked her head curiously. ‚ÄúYou said you‚Äôre a writer, I thought for sure you‚Äôd know it.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúAlways been better with faces than names I guess.‚Äù

Her eyes twinkled and she perched on the end of the couch. ‚ÄúI see. Elizabeth was the most prolific female serial killer the world has ever known.‚Äù My shock must have shown on my face because she chuckled and continued. ‚ÄúAccording to the legends at least. They really run the gamut, from Elizabeth being a killer, to being a literal vampire, all the way to being an innocent woman that got caught up in political power schemes of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh‚Ä¶ what do you believe?‚Äù

Eliza shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe a bit of everything‚Ä¶ people have a tendency to think that women can‚Äôt be evil, but I know my own heart better than anyone else, and I know what I could do if I chose to.‚Äù¬†

A chill went through my heart then, but was lessened when she chuckled again, giving me a wink.

‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt worry,‚Äù she said quickly. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a retelling of Misery, never fear.‚Äù

She got up and replaced the picture on the end table, before running her fingers along a nearby stack of books as if looking for something. ‚ÄúMy line isn‚Äôt exactly legitimate‚Ä¶ but somewhere through the history we took the name Bathory back. A matter of some pride I suppose.‚Äù Her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, there was still a stigma attached to the name, so when grandmother came here, she changed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo Bates?‚Äù I asked, still puzzled by the conversation‚Äôs unexpected turn. ‚ÄúBut I thought you said you were married.‚Äù

She waved her hand dismissively. ‚ÄúWe are royals, we Bates‚Äôs, legitimate or not. If a man doesn‚Äôt want to take our royal name, we don‚Äôt marry them.‚Äù She snorted again, someone bitterly. ‚ÄúNot that it matters much now. My husband died before we could pass the name to a new generation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. How long ago did‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúLong enough I suppose,‚Äù she answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to go out again‚Ä¶ to find someone again I guess, but it‚Äôs always hard to leave this house. I‚Äôve lived here for so long now I can‚Äôt seem to bring myself to leave.‚Äù

She found the book she was looking for and pulled it out with a triumphant flair. ‚ÄúAh. Beauty and the Beast. It‚Äôs my favorite story‚Ä¶ the original version and the modern version I suppose.‚Äù She flipped through the pages. ‚ÄúThis house is my castle, but I‚Äôve no kiss to give or to get.‚Äù

A strange feeling settled in the pit of my stomach as Eliza shook herself and turned away. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you to your breakfast. Is there anything you need brought to the room? I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have a Tv or a computer, but you are welcome to read anything in my collection.‚Äù

I hesitated, suddenly wondering if I was being confined to the room. ‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ actually, I‚Äôd like to go check on my car. Maybe I can get it running and get out of your way.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not in my way Mr. Hale,‚Äù Eliza said easily, her hand on the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have Hubert check the roads. More trees fell while you were asleep so they may not be safe. I‚Äôll also have him bring up something for you to write with while I prepare for lunch.‚Äù She started to leave and then hesitated. ‚ÄúFeel free to explore Mr. Hale, but I must warn you that some doors are locked. This is a strange old mansion, and some things are better left hidden. There is a larger library down on the first floor to the left of the kitchen if you would like to see it.‚Äù Her smile grew wide and warm. ‚ÄúBut first eat your breakfast. I wouldn‚Äôt want a guest of mine to go hungry.‚Äù

When she was gone, I sighed and settled down on the couch. It was a comfortable couch, more comfortable than mine at least, and I began to pick over the food. The uncomfortable feeling had vanished with Eliza‚Äôs invitation to explore, and I began to wonder if I could pick her brain for ideas on stories. Maybe she would even be willing to do an interview for the podcast. A direct descendant of one of the most infamous women in history would be a spectacular interview.¬†

The food was good, a mild sausage link and beautifully scrambled eggs, but I wasn‚Äôt hungry, so I packed up the tray and left, taking several deep drinks of the coffee as I went. My room opened into a narrow hall, a classic old mansion‚Äôs hall, lined with pictures and ornate tables with vases of colorful flowers or other expensive looking knick-knacks. The hall led to a balcony over a great living room with a wide staircase that followed the wall. Steps creaked slightly under my feet and I tensed, feeling almost like I was in a museum. I saw Eliza through an open door next to another hallway, bustling this way and that around a kitchen that looked like it belonged in the 1950s. Today she was dressed in a simple black skirt and blouse, with a white apron with blue stripes tied around her waist.¬†

‚ÄúHello Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said without turning around. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, not really,‚Äù I said as I stepped inside the kitchen. ‚ÄúMy head still hurts a bit actually.‚Äù

Eliza ushered me to a seat at a small table before taking the tray and placing it in the sink. Cupboards rattled as she filled a glass with tap water, adding dashes of herbs from several jars set above the stove.

‚ÄúHere, drink this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAn old family recipe‚Ä¶ it does wonders for aches and pains of all sorts. Even better than medicine.‚Äù¬†

The herbed water was pungent and left a strange, dry taste on my tongue, but it was cool, and I could almost imagine the pain draining down out of my head as I drank.¬†

She grinned. ‚ÄúSee? Now what can I do for you Mr. Hale?‚Äù

‚ÄúI actually wondered if you could help me with some research,‚Äù I answered slowly. ‚ÄúI help write and research for a podcast that covers interesting history, and things like that. Do you think you would be willing to do an interview?‚Äù Her eyebrows drew together and I raised my hands. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt want to that‚Äôs fine, but I think it would be great to get a story about someone like Elizabeth Bathory from a direct descendant, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

Eliza thought for a long moment. ‚ÄúA podcast is a radio show, right? I wouldn‚Äôt have to be on a camera?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo cameras,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúYou could even call the show from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe I should‚Ä¶‚Äù she said slowly as she returned to her work, chopping and assembling various fruits into a pastry crust. ‚ÄúIt would be good to get out of the house. Heaven knows I‚Äôve been here long enough.‚Äù She glanced my way. ‚ÄúIs this all you write Mr. Hale? History and mystery?‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI tried to write novels‚Ä¶ finished several actually, but I couldn‚Äôt get them to sell. I got lucky when I found the podcast. Now I get to do some of my favorite things. Learn and write, and I get to do it for a job.‚Äù

Her eyes twinkled. ‚ÄúI like you Mr. Hale. I was beginning to think that people have lost the taste for learning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love to learn. My mom used to tell me that I knew a lot of random crap about a lot of random crap, but I always thought it was interesting. History is my favorite, but I like science, psychology, philosophy‚Ä¶ basically anything that sparks an interest.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYou sound like my Hubert,‚Äù Eliza said without turning around. ‚ÄúHe is a jack of all trades and a master of several.‚Äù She chuckled. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I could stand around people who didn‚Äôt have a thirst for knowledge. Tell me, do you speak any languages other than English?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI wish I could, but I can‚Äôt. I tried to learn Spanish in school, but I couldn‚Äôt roll my r‚Äôs and kept getting in trouble with the teacher. I might have a knack for the written word, but something doesn‚Äôt work when it comes to other languages. Kind of like the problems I have with math.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should spend some time abroad,‚Äù she said easily. ‚ÄúBeing immersed in a language is the best way to learn after all. Besides, I think you would like my homeland. There is an incredible amount of history in those mountains and forests.‚Äù She finished her work and covered the pastry with a cloth before sitting down across from me, folding her hands demurely on her lap. ‚ÄúI spent time in my family‚Äôs old lands in my youth. I‚Äôll wager you could get enough material to drive your podcast for months.‚Äù¬†

I nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been interested in European folklore, but most of our listeners are from the Americas, so we usually collect local stories. I‚Äôve been trying to get the guys to branch out though, so who knows.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not make your own podcast then?‚Äù

It was a question that I‚Äôd been asked before and I stared down at my lap with a shrug. ‚ÄúEh, I don‚Äôt know. I like to write and to study, but I don‚Äôt like talking all that much. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm interesting enough to be a host, honestly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI doubt that.‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou seem quite fascinating. So, what local legends brought you to this place?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ well, I have a friend who had some kind of encounter up here,‚Äù I answered slowly. ‚ÄúI was talking to him about the Betty and Barney Hill incident, and he started saying that he knew what it was like to have a story that people didn‚Äôt believe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetty and Barney Hill?‚Äù Eliza asked. ‚ÄúThe alien abductees?‚Äù She cocked her head. ‚ÄúDo you believe the story? It sounds‚Ä¶ fantastical at the least.‚Äù

I shrugged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. There are so many stories that I can‚Äôt believe all of them are fake. I just don‚Äôt know for sure what I think is happening.‚Äù

Eliza tapped her fingers against the tabletop. ‚ÄúYou know, there were stories in my homeland about people being taken, lights in the sky, strange beings with large heads and enormous eyes.‚Äù She paused and chuckled. ‚ÄúThen again we were talking about fairies.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of that,‚Äù I said, leaning forward. ‚ÄúBut I never really knew what to think of it. It seems like people have been experiencing this sort of thing for as long as there have been people.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd?‚Äù

It was a simple prompt, but one that was hard for me to answer.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been working on a theory,‚Äù I said at last. ‚ÄúOne that explains why all of these weird stories seem to have connections. I‚Äôm not very far along with it, but it almost all seems spiritual in some way. Even the alien stuff.‚Äù

Eliza seemed to want to ask a question but then sighed and grinned. ‚ÄúI guess I never thought of it that way. Or, I never expected to find someone who thinks that way at least. Are there really that many stories here in New Hampshire?‚Äù She gestured out the window at the rain and the woods. ‚ÄúIt seems so quiet here.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere are a lot of stories here,‚Äù I replied eagerly. ‚ÄúPeople just don‚Äôt talk about them often. Native Americans had stories about wild-men and the colonists here started calling them wood devils, you have some infamous ghost stories, there‚Äôs even a few reported vampire legends not too far away.‚Äù

Her eyes flickered and she went still. ‚ÄúReally? Like what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, one of the first reported vampires in New England was a student at Dartmouth College not long after it was founded.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI forget his name. I‚Äôd look it up, but I don‚Äôt have a phone that works.‚Äù

Eliza sat back in her chair, almost seeming to relax. ‚ÄúOh, that sounds like when they thought that tuberculosis victims were vampires. That makes me feel a little bit better.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know right? Some of the vampire legends you can find are terrifying. Like down in New Orleans there were some stories that coincided with massive upticks in disappearances. They‚Äôre old stories, but still.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see someone who takes the supernatural world seriously for a change,‚Äù Eliza said, flashing a wry smile. ‚ÄúIt reminds me of the old country.‚Äù She drummed her fingers against the table again, a quick, hard beat that seemed louder than should have been possible. ‚ÄúTell me, Mr. Hale, what do you know about curses?‚Äù

‚ÄúCurses? I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know. I believe that they‚Äôre possible, but I‚Äôve never really studied it. Witchcraft really spooks me, I guess. Why?‚Äù

She hesitated for a long time. ‚ÄúDo you promise to believe me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes of course I‚Äôll believe you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, getting up and beginning to pace nervously. ‚ÄúNo one believed me, but my husband died because we were cursed. And now, if I ever leave this property, the same thing will happen to me.‚Äù

My heart dropped into my stomach. ‚ÄúAre you serious? H... how? What happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Bathory name followed us here,‚Äù Eliza said, her back to me. ‚ÄúI suppose I never wanted to let it go. I just didn‚Äôt expect the shadows to come with me.‚Äù

My heart went from my stomach to my toes. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt been quite honest,‚Äù Eliza said, still without turning around. ‚ÄúI am Elizabeth Bathory.‚Äù She turned around and nodded.¬†

I yelped as two massive hands landed on my shoulders, pressing me down into my seat.

‚ÄúDear Hubert,‚Äù Eliza, er, Elizabeth crooned. ‚ÄúThank you my dear. Take him downstairs.‚Äù¬†

Hubert spun me around and I had my first look at the butler. He was tall and wide shouldered and might have been handsome if his skin wasn‚Äôt grey and lifeless. Dead, white eyes stared at me from sunken sockets and wrinkled lips twisted in a grimace that might have been a smile as his fingers tightened with unbelievable strength. Elizabeth grinned over his shoulder and her beautiful features faded, becoming skeletal and shrunken. Her eyes went from grey to red and her teeth lengthened jagged points.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve waited so long for a believer, haven‚Äôt we?‚Äù she said as the butler dragged me helplessly out of the room. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt be long now‚Ä¶ soon we will walk free again.‚Äù

I tried to struggle free only to have Hubert cuff me on the side of the head, a closed fist blow that made my legs go slack and my head spin.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù I gasped as the dead butler pushed me down a narrow stair to a basement. ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do to me?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe blood of a believer is a powerful thing,‚Äù Elizabeth said, ignoring my frantic questions. ‚ÄúA powerful thing indeed.‚Äù

Candles flickered to life, and I screamed as the shifting shadows pulled back to show moldering skeletons hung by their wrists to the walls. Hubert cuffed me again.

‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he rumbled, his voice a deep rasp. ‚ÄúNo one can hear you.‚Äù He threw me into a heavy seat, almost a throne made of dark, stained wood. ‚ÄúThe louder you are, the more I‚Äôll make it hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow, now dear,‚Äù whispered Elizabeth as she unpacked a set of sharp instruments from a cupboard. ‚ÄúBe kind to our writing friend.‚Äù She held up a scalpel and moved it in front of my face, barely grazing the skin of my nose. ‚ÄúSurely a teller of stories would like to hear ours.‚Äù

Hubert merely grunted, latching my wrists and ankles with heavy leather straps before retreating to a place behind his master.

‚ÄúIgnore him Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said, wrenching my wrist until the back of my hand was flat on the chair of the arm. A sweet pain jolted up my arm as she flicked the blade over the skin, barely drawing blood. ‚ÄúMy late husband has lost much of his sense of humor over the years.‚Äù

She stared at the tiny red drops on the blade for a long moment before returning to her tools. ‚ÄúPeople called me a monster‚Ä¶ a vampire, a witch or what have you. Now people claim that I am a psychopath.‚Äù

I started to talk, to beg for my life or to scream for help, but she was behind me in a moment, snapping a thick cloth over my mouth. ‚ÄúAs if I was anything so pedestrian as a serial killer or a rotting undead thing.‚Äù

My eyes went from the pale, toothy woman to the mummy like Hubert. Elizabeth rolled her eyes, as if she had heard my thoughts.

‚ÄúI am very much alive Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSpells of blood and darkness sustain me still, as faded as they have been of late.‚Äù A new tool glittered in her hand, an oddly shaped set of pliers and I shrieked into the gag as she pulled a fingernail from my hand as easily as you could pull a scab. ‚ÄúOnce I escaped my imprisonment I had thought I would live in peace forever.‚Äù

She grinned and licked the bloody nail before throwing it to the floor. Her hand went to Hubert‚Äôs face, and she caressed his cheek fondly. ‚ÄúEventually I found someone like myself and we hunted together until someone found his kills.‚Äù Hubert grunted and she laughed. ‚ÄúNo, no my darling, it was thrilling. Anyway, we fled here and once again, I thought life would be peaceful.‚Äù

Her fingers closed around the blade again and it flickered, this time cutting deeper into my wrist. I winced and bit my tongue, struggling not to scream through the suffocating gag. My eyes widened as I noticed a nick in the leather next to the seeping cut.¬†

‚ÄúBlood sustained us,‚Äù Elizabeth continued, admiring the red stain on the silver blade. ‚ÄúBlood fueled the magic, but eventually people began to notice that girls traveled into these woods and never came back.‚Äù Her red eyes flickered to mine and I saw a hint of disgust, almost hidden by hunger. ‚ÄúWomen are so much sweeter than men after all.‚Äù

At some unseen signal, Hubert snatched goblet from a shelf and placed it on a small sconce below my arm. If I strained my neck I could see drops of my blood spattering on the silver as it trickled down a groove carved into the heavy wood.¬†

‚ÄúSome priest was called to work his white magic here,‚Äù Elizabeth continued, ignoring my pained thrashing as she used a candle to heat the scalpel before pressing the heated blade to the wound where she had ripped a nail free. ‚ÄúHuh, he would have been better to call on the Son of God than the Queen of Heaven, but his curse was done.‚Äù She gestured to a tattered heap of cloth and bones in the corner. ‚ÄúMaybe he would have lived to tell the tale. Now, just any blood won‚Äôt do.‚Äù Pain flared from my other wrist as she neatly opened a vertical cut.¬†

‚ÄúThe blood of a believer,‚Äù she said, echoing and earlier thought as Hubert put a second goblet in place. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be better off if you didn‚Äôt believe in the supernatural Mr. Hale. Perhaps then I wouldn‚Äôt even be able to touch you, to lure or trap you in this tomb of mine.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúI wondered if you might be more than a quick meal,‚Äù she continued, slashing a second line in my arm. ‚ÄúA soul for a soul might just break this curse for me.‚Äù

Hubert stirred behind her. ‚ÄúA soul for a soul Elizabeth? What about me?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour sloppy work got us here!‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúWith him one of us might just walk out of here, and I‚Äôll be damned again before I stay behind.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou promised me,‚Äù the big man rumbled, looming over her. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you leave me‚Ä¶‚Äù

There was a snapping noise as she plunged her hand into his chest, breaking ribs and tearing dried flesh as she ripped out his dusty heart. Her eyes flashed. ‚ÄúWhat can I say dear Hubert?‚Äù she asked as he fell to his knees, the pale light slowly fading from his eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve become boring in your old age.‚Äù

The organ crumbled to dust in her fingers, and she brushed it off, turning to me. She picked up the first goblet, already partially filled with blood. My head was pounding, and I felt more tired than I‚Äôd ever felt before and I could only whimper as she stared at me, sipping my lifeforce like wine.

‚ÄúYou have a choice Mr. Hale,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was going to let Hubert have a few sips, enough to keep him from turning to dust while I searched for more prey‚Ä¶‚Äù she paused and gestured at the fallen butler. ‚ÄúBut as you can see, I‚Äôm in need of a companion.‚Äù¬†

I only glared at her, deciding that since death was inevitable, I might as well make it defiant.¬†

She cocked her head, a smirk on her face, which had returned to the young beauty that she had displayed at first.¬† ‚ÄúOh? You think that I‚Äôm going to kill you? No. Now I will make you live whether you want to or not.‚Äù The knife in her off hand flickered and cut through the gag, leaving a thin bloody line on my cheek. ‚ÄúYou can walk out of here with me, never to see this dreadful place again, or you can stay here as a thrall, to be tortured for the rest of your life until I decide to end it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy would I join you?‚Äù I gasped, barely able to keep my head up.¬†

Elizabeth Bathory grinned and drew her fingers over the gash in my wrist. The skin rippled and itched and pulled back together. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a little torture among friends, hmm Mr. Hale? I can give you life beyond death, riches enough to travel and do whatever you want.‚Äù She touched my cheek with hands that felt like ice. ‚ÄúThe only cost would be serving me as a fellow huntsman.‚Äù

I pulled away, staring at the bones hanging on the wall. ‚ÄúWhat, help you hunt and murder people so you can drink their blood?‚Äù

‚ÄúDrinking is for special occasions,‚Äù she said as she combined the blood in the goblets, using her fingertip to trace symbols on the chair and my arms. ‚ÄúBaths are so much more invigorating. This is your last chance Mr. Hale‚Ä¶ do you want a future of pain or of pleasure?‚Äù

Blood had soaked my wrist, and I could feel the leather strap slip slightly as I pulled. I mustered all my strength and wrenched my hand free, tearing through the strap until it was hanging by a strand. Elizabeth‚Äôs eyes widened as I snatched the scalpel from her pocket and stabbed at her chest. She staggered back with a gasp, and I cut¬†my other hand free before struggling with the straps wrapped around my ankles. The blade caught on the hem of my pants, tearing a deep gash in my leg as I pulled free and staggered to the stairs. Icy hands grabbed my shoulders and threw me back against the wall.¬†

‚ÄúYou nearly got away,‚Äù Eliza gasped from across the room, her hand extended. Shadows shifted, extending like smoke from her palm as they wrapped around me and held me against the cold stone of the cellar wall, inches away from the faded bones. ‚ÄúHeh, I haven‚Äôt had this much fun in ages.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúScrew you,‚Äù I gasped. ‚ÄúJust kill me and get it over with.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand,‚Äù she hissed as she loomed up in front of me. ‚ÄúYou had your chances‚Ä¶ now I‚Äôm going to change you‚Ä¶ torture you until the pain becomes pleasure and you are happy to hunt. The best of both worlds.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt want to think about what she did to me. Let‚Äôs just say that there was blood and pain and eventually I wasn‚Äôt even sure what day it was. The rain did stop, and Elizabeth let me out of the basement and made me walk with her to the edge of the road. Something stopped me there, just beyond the edge of the old driveway near the ancient mailbox, and she laughed as I watched her drive away in my car. Once she was gone, I walked the property, trapped inside by some invisible fence. To my surprise the house seemed to have changed, become new. There was electricity, not from a generator, but there were no phones and the doors that had once been locked, if they had been locked, were open. The library was as she had promised; there was even an old typewriter and a desk in the corner, the same typewriter that I‚Äôm using to record this story.

I don‚Äôt know how long she will be gone, but with any luck I can get this finished and put it in the mailbox. Maybe the mail carrier will find and send it to my friends at the podcast. Maybe no one will ever find it. Who knows.

If you are reading this though, please listen. Tom, Harry‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt come looking for me. It‚Äôs too dangerous. Elizabeth is dangerous and ruthless, and as clever as the devil himself. The things that she can do‚Ä¶ just don‚Äôt come here. Tell people that if they ever find and old house in the woods up here in the mountains, to stay away. Monsters are real, and they are living inside. With any luck I can find the ritual that the old priest used in one of these books, but until then look out. I don‚Äôt know what she is, but I know that she is hunting and that she is hungry. Eliza Bates, Elizabeth Bathory‚Ä¶ she might not have always been a monster, but she certainly is now.¬†

""I don't know how you can sleep in this house, man,"" Alex said, his voice hushed like he didn‚Äôt want it to carry too far. We were sitting in my room, it was a saturday afternoon.¬†

""What am I supposed to do?"" I shot back, a little sharper than I intended.

He shook his head, grimacing. ""I‚Äôd rather be homeless, dude. Seriously. I‚Äôd take my chances with a cardboard box and alley cats before sleeping under this roof again.""

I had just told Alex everything.The dream, the shadow in the garage, the deadbolt clicking in the middle of the night, and the way my dad drifted through the dark like he wasn‚Äôt quite real.

""You‚Äôve been in the garage though, right?"" he asked, squinting at me like he was searching for some kind of lie I hadn‚Äôt confessed yet.

""Of course I have. I‚Äôve been in there a million times. It‚Äôs just a normal garage.""

Even as the words left my mouth, they felt sour and thin. That wasn‚Äôt the whole truth. Not even close. I knew it, maybe Alex did too.¬†

Yes, I had been in the garage‚Äîbut only ever through the overhead doors or the rear entrance, the one that looks out into the backyard. Never, not once in my nearly fifteen years of life, had I stepped through the red door that connected the garage to the house. Not from the kitchen. Not from the hall. Not from anywhere inside. That door might as well have been bricked over in my mind.

And I had known this was strange for a long time. I had known.

But saying it out loud, or even really admitting it to myself felt like pulling a trigger on something that couldn‚Äôt be undone. Because if I accepted that, then I had to accept something far worse: that my father wasn‚Äôt who he said he was.

And I don‚Äôt know which truth is harder to live with.

Either there‚Äôs a witch in the garage. Or there‚Äôs a monster in the house.

""Did you ever try to do what Danny did?"" Alex asked, his voice low, almost like he didn‚Äôt want the question to echo in the room.

""What do you mean?"" I replied, even though I had a feeling I already knew.

""Well, Danny stood by the garage door, right? And the witch spoke to him. Have you ever tried that?""

I had. More than once, in fact. Over the years, I‚Äôd lingered around the garage, sometimes standing still for long stretches of time, sometimes pacing back and forth just outside the red door, hoping and dreading that I might hear something. But either nothing happened or my dad always seemed to appear, needing my help with something. A chore. A question. A distraction.

I was explaining all this to Alex when we both froze at the soft knock on my bedroom door.

My dad‚Äôs head poked around the frame a second later.

""Hey guys,"" he said with his usual relaxed smile. ""We‚Äôre heading to the dump to drop off some old stuff. Found a box of your things from when you were little. Mind going through it and pulling anything you want to keep?""

He placed the box in my hands without waiting for an answer, then turned and walked away.

""Sure,"" I said flatly to the empty hallway.

We sat cross-legged on the floor as I peeled open the flaps of the old cardboard box. A puff of dust lifted into the air, catching the light like ash. Inside were old plastic toys with missing arms, a faded baseball cap, and a small trophy that read ‚Äú3rd Place - Karate.‚Äù

""When did you do karate?"" Alex asked with a smirk, clearly holding back laughter.

""Don‚Äôt mess with me, man. I‚Äôll sweep your legs,"" I said, making a ridiculous chopping motion in the air.

We both laughed and kept digging. The box was a time capsule of forgotten odds and ends. Stickers, marbles, bits of colored string, a yo-yo that no longer lit up. At the very bottom were a stack of drawings, folded and crumpled, their paper soft with age. Most were harmless, dogs, fish, some scribbles that might‚Äôve been superheroes or dinosaurs. We joked about my artistic skills, flipping through them one by one.

Then Alex went quiet.

He held a drawing in his hand, staring at it for too long. The amusement drained from his face.

""You have a sister?"" he asked, his tone suddenly cautious.

""No,"" I said, hesitating. ""Why?""

He turned the drawing toward me.

It was a simple picture, the kind any little kid would draw. A house made of a square and a triangle, smoke curling from a cartoon chimney, the sun in the corner, a patch of green grass. In front of the house stood four stick figures. One small, probably meant to be me. One tall, broad-shouldered figure, definitely my dad. One with a dress and long brown lines for hair, my mom. And then... another woman. Same size as my mom. Same long hair. Standing just a few steps apart, like she belonged there.

Alex pointed at them, slowly. ""Kid. Dad. Mom... Mom?""

My stomach turned. I could hear the soft creak of my father‚Äôs footsteps coming down the hallway.

Without a word, I grabbed the drawing and slid it under the bed.

Dad stepped into the room just as I finished. ""Find anything you want to keep?"" he asked, eyes flicking between us.

""No,"" I said quickly, loading everything back into the box.

He nodded, cheerful as ever. ""Alright then. We‚Äôll be back in an hour or so.""

""Okay."" I didn‚Äôt look at him.

Something in the air shifted. His smile dipped for half a second, just a flicker but I saw it. He was reading the room.

""Be good,"" he said, and then he was gone.

We listened as the front door opened and shut, the car doors slammed, and the engine disappeared down the street.

""Was that a drawing of the witch?"" Alex finally said, his voice rising with disbelief.

""It was just a drawing,"" I said too quickly, searching for any kind of reasonable explanation but nothing came. My mind was blank.

""A drawing of a son, a dad, a mom, and... another mom,"" Alex said again, slower this time.

We stared at each other, the room suddenly too quiet. The air felt heavier.

Under the bed, the paper lay dormant.

I reached under and lifted the paper.¬†

I started to speak slowly ‚ÄúKid, Dad, Mom‚Äù

‚ÄúWitch‚Äù Alex cut me off.¬†

**Chapter 7**

Alex doesn‚Äôt sleep over anymore. Not that night. Not since.

He says it‚Äôs because of school, or his parents, or just needing a break, but I know better. I think we both do. The house feels different now. There‚Äôs something heavy in the air, something unspoken, a secret hideousness. My mom and dad still move through our days like everything‚Äôs fine. We eat dinner together. We laugh. We talk about nothing. But it all feels rehearsed, like lines read from a script in a play no one wants to watch.

A performance, not a life.

And my dad, he knows something. I can feel it in the way he looks at me sometimes, like he‚Äôs checking to see if I know too. And I do. I don‚Äôt know what, not exactly, but I know enough to know that nothing is what it seems. And I think he knows that I know.

Last night, I had another dream.

No, not a dream. A memory wearing a dream‚Äôs skin.

I was crying. Alone. At the bottom of something. A pit maybe, a hole carved deep into the earth. I was sitting on a slick, rotting heap of garbage. Wet cardboard, plastic, food wrappers bloated with decay. The air stank of mildew and something far worse, like meat left out too long.

It was cold. My skin ached. My body throbbed with a dull, steady pain that pulsed like a heartbeat. The darkness was thick, almost physical. But then. Click. A light above snapped on.

A spotlight.

A single circle of harsh white light opened far above me. I looked up and saw bricks curving around me like the inside of a well, rising twenty feet or more. I was in a tunnel or a shaft, some place meant to hold things. Or trap them.

I heard footsteps above me. Muffled. Slow. Methodical. They echoed strangely, as though they were underwater. I realized I could no longer hear my own crying. My mouth was open, my face soaked in tears, but there was no sound. Like the world had turned down the volume.

Then the light dimmed slightly, something was standing over the opening.

A silhouette. A head. Someone was looking down at me.

I didn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt. My breath caught in my throat as the figure lifted a hand and gave a gentle wave. Familiar. Too familiar.

In the other hand, they held a brown paper bag. They let it drop.

It struck my shoulder before sliding to the floor. I opened it with shaking hands.

Two slices of pizza.

Cold, greasy, and smeared against the inside of the bag‚Äîbut I devoured them without thinking. My hunger roared to the surface like a beast. I had been starving. Starving for longer than I could understand.

The figure stood above me, still and silent. Then they stepped away.

Their shadow receded from the light, and the footsteps returned, fading like a lullaby played backward.

Click.

The light went out.

Nothing but darkness. Absolute. I couldn‚Äôt see my hands. Couldn‚Äôt feel the floor beneath me. Just the cold. The wet. The black.

And somewhere in that black, I kept crying, soundless, voiceless, waiting for the next bag to fall.

I awoke the way I always do now. Soaked in sweat, heart pounding so violently I could feel it in my throat.¬†

I turned my head toward the alarm clock. That familiar red light burned through the darkness, too sharp to look at directly, bleeding into the walls and ceiling like a warning.

3:04 a.m.

I found myself wondering if my dad was awake.

What a strange, grim thought.

Who wants to be awake at this hour? What is there to do in the dead middle of the night but wait for something to go wrong?

Still, I got up. Wide awake. My stomach clawed at me with a hollow ache, like the hunger from my dream had followed me across the threshold of sleep and into this world.

I turned on the light. No need for stealth, I wasn‚Äôt sneaking around. I was just hungry. That was all.

I made my way to the kitchen, passing the dining table without thinking. The fridge greeted me with a dull hum. Cold air spilled over my bare feet as I opened it.

We had pizza yesterday.

Pizza is my favorite. It‚Äôs what I ask for every time my parents let me choose dinner. A little ritual of comfort. Predictable.

But the box was empty.

Completely, insultingly empty.

I sighed. Mom hates when we do that. Leave containers behind with nothing inside. She acts like it‚Äôs a betrayal of the home itself, some grave violation. I found it quite funny actually. Along with the empty pizza box in the fridge there was also a bag of Salt was left out on the counter. Mom would be so pissed.¬†¬†

I figured Dad must‚Äôve eaten the last of it. I shut the door and pivoted to Plan B. Ramen noodles.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing up?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs voice, casual, calm.

My body reacted before my brain did. I physically jumped, feet leaving the ground. A shock of pure fear surged through me like a live wire.

He was sitting at the dining table.

In the dark.

He‚Äôd been there the whole time. Watched me walk by. Watched me open the fridge. Watched me searching, unaware of the eyes fixed on my back.

‚ÄúJesus Christ, Dad,‚Äù I gasped, clutching at my chest.

He didn‚Äôt smile. Didn‚Äôt laugh. Just sat there, watching me. His face empty, unreadable.

Then, slowly, like remembering how to perform, a grin spread across his mouth.

‚ÄúSorry, son,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt mean to scare you.‚Äù

I nodded, swallowing down the last of my panic, trying to find the edges of composure.

‚ÄúI was just... hungry,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWanted some pizza.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he replied.

There was something strange about how he said it. Not annoyed. Not apologetic. Just final.

‚ÄúDid you eat it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúI just told you,‚Äù he said, smile unwavering. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gone. Who else would‚Äôve eaten it?‚Äù

I wanted to say nothing. I wanted to let it drop.

‚ÄúThe witch in the garage,‚Äù I said flatly.

He didn‚Äôt move.

Five, maybe ten seconds passed. Then he laughed. A weak, fake laugh like someone trying to mimic the sound without really feeling it.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

He stood up, slowly. He looked at the table for a long moment, then lifted his gaze to meet mine. His eyes were glassy, unreadable.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù he began, voice low. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of darkness in this world.‚Äù

The words hit me like a crack of thunder, sudden, loud, impossible to ignore.

It was the first time I had ever heard my father speak without his usual mask. There was no warmth in his tone. Just truth.

‚ÄúThere are things out there,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúthat are hard to explain. Things that don‚Äôt make sense. Things I hope you never have to understand.‚Äù

He paused.

‚ÄúBut maybe one day you will have to.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt move. Couldn‚Äôt speak. I was rooted in place. Frozen.

‚ÄúWhat are you trying to say?‚Äù I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He looked down, muttered something I didn‚Äôt catch. Then he spoke clearly again.

‚ÄúEverything I do,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI do for you and your mother.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know how to respond.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I murmured. What else was there to say?

‚ÄúI love you, Sam,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI love you too, Dad,‚Äù I replied, throat tight.

He smirked, not smiled, smirked. A quick exhale coming from his nose.¬†

‚ÄúDad,‚Äù I said slowly, cautiously, ‚Äúif I ask you something... do you promise to tell me the truth?‚Äù

He looked at me. Really looked. Then raised both hands and rubbed his face, slowly, like wiping something invisible from his skin.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said, and this time his voice was grave. ‚ÄúYou can ask me a question.‚Äù

He emphasized the word ‚ÄòA‚Äô as if to make it clear I only got one.

Just one.

My body began to tremble. I didn‚Äôt know why. I was only a boy, standing in front of his father. A scene that should have been safe. Familiar.

But something was wrong.

‚ÄúIs the witch real?‚Äù I asked, keeping my voice steady.

‚ÄúYes, Sam,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe witch is real.‚Äù

Then he turned and walked back toward his bedroom. No explanation. No fear.

Just silence.

**Chapter 8**

There were so many questions I could have asked him. Do we have a basement? Was there ever someone else in our family? Is the witch in a well?

But I panicked. My chest was tight, my thoughts were spiraling, and I asked the first thing that came to mind.

‚ÄúHe said it was real?‚Äù Alex repeated, barely above a whisper.

We sat together at lunch, shoulders hunched forward, our voices low. The world around us was loud, kids yelling, laughing, the clatter of trays, but it all felt distant. Sounded like we were underwater again.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered.

He looked at me, eyes wide. ‚ÄúYour dad said that? Just like that?‚Äù

I nodded, not offering more.

Alex stared down at his untouched sandwich. ‚ÄúAnything else happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust more nightmares.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it anymore. Every time I brought it up, every time I said the word witch or garage or red door, I felt like something drained out of me. I wasn‚Äôt even afraid anymore, just tired. Worn out from the weight of secrets I didn‚Äôt understand.

Danny walked past us in the cafeteria, surrounded by his usual group. He caught my eye and gave a friendly nod. He looked normal. Happy. But I knew he wasn‚Äôt. How could he be? I've never seen the witch, never heard her, and she spoke to him.¬†

Later, Alex invited me to spend the weekend at his place. Play video games. Watch dumb movies. Fall asleep at 4am like we used to. I told him I wasn‚Äôt up for it. I just wanted to sleep.

That was a lie.

When I got home, I sat in my room, staring at the picture. The one from the box. The drawing with the square house, the triangle roof, and four figures standing out front.

‚ÄúA kid. A dad. A mom. And... a mom.‚Äù I said aloud.

My voice sounded small in the quiet room.

I could hear my real mom in the kitchen, pans clinking, the faint hiss of something frying in oil. She was humming softly to herself.

I walked out and stood in the kitchen doorway. She looked over, smiling. ‚ÄúHey sweetheart. Everything okay?‚Äù

I hesitated, then handed her the picture. ‚ÄúI found this in that old box Dad gave me.‚Äù

She took it, holding it gently between her fingers like it might crumble. ‚ÄúAw, Sam... This is adorable. I forgot how much you used to draw. You were so creative.‚Äù

I stared at her. ‚ÄúMom. Why are there two women in the drawing?‚Äù

She blinked. ‚ÄúTwo?‚Äù

I pointed. ‚ÄúThere. That one‚Äôs you. That one‚Äôs Dad. That‚Äôs me. who‚Äôs *she*?‚Äù

Her face didn‚Äôt change. No flash of fear, no confusion. Just a calm, almost practiced smile.

‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt know, honey. You had such a wild imagination as a kid. Maybe you wanted a sister, or maybe she was a friend. You used to make up stories all the time, remember?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúShe looks exactly like you,‚Äù I said. My voice was flat.

Mom chuckled softly. ‚ÄúWell, they‚Äôre stick figures, Sam. How different could she look?‚Äù

She had a point. But it didn‚Äôt feel right.

‚ÄúIs everything okay?‚Äù she asked again, tilting her head. Her voice was so gentle, so sincere. And for a moment, I felt safe. For the first time in weeks.

But maybe that was the plan.

My mind started racing. I saw flashes of memory. A dark hallway. The sound of a latch. A smell like wet brick and iron. Things I had ignored for years. Weird noises. Locked doors. The red door.

There was a truth hiding behind the drywall of this house. It had been growing in the walls like mold since I was a child.

‚ÄúHave you ever gone through the red door, Mom?‚Äù I asked.

She looked up from the picture and laughed, confused. ‚ÄúThe red door? In the garage?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, Sam. We were in there last week, remember? We moved those boxes together.‚Äù She gave me a puzzled look and shook her head.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what I asked.‚Äù

She paused. Her smile faltered, just a little.

‚ÄúI asked,‚Äù I said again, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve ever *gone* through the red door.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, the red door leads to the garage,‚Äù she said, her voice suddenly firm.

‚ÄúDoes it?‚Äù I took a step forward. My voice was shaking now. ‚ÄúSo we don‚Äôt have a basement? That door just goes to the garage and nowhere *else*?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù she said quickly. Too quickly.

‚ÄúThen why are there *locks* on both sides of it?‚Äù I snapped. ‚ÄúWhy does it lock from the inside and the outside, Mom?‚Äù

She stared at me. Her eyes began to shimmer. A tear rolled down her cheek.

‚ÄúSam...‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúPlease, stop. You‚Äôre scaring me.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚Äú*Dad* is the one who‚Äôs scaring me. I know he‚Äôs hiding something. I know you are too.‚Äù

She stepped forward and reached out. ‚ÄúSweetheart, you‚Äôre not well. Maybe it‚Äôs just the nightmares, or stress, or‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not crazy,‚Äù I hissed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just good at pretending.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam, please,‚Äù she said, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúYou need help. You‚Äôre saying things that aren‚Äôt real.‚Äù

I backed away from her, from the kitchen, from her soft eyes that looked more like lies than comfort now.

She stood there holding the drawing in her hand. The one with the fourth figure. The one she didn‚Äôt name.

The woman in the picture was still smiling. And I didn‚Äôt know who she was. But she looked a lot like my mother.

**Chapter 9**

After the fight, I went back to my room and shut the door behind me. The air felt heavier now. Still. Like the house was holding its breath. I sat on the edge of my bed, elbows on my knees, just waiting for the sound of the front door opening, for his footsteps, for something.

Dad always got home around 5:30. Like clockwork.

But 5:30 came and went.

Then 6:00.

Then 6:45.

The sun had vanished by then, and the blue twilight outside was starting to curdle into full night. I checked the time again. 7:00. Nothing.

At 7:10 p.m., the phone rang.

It was a sharp, old-fashioned sound. Like something out of a dream, or a nightmare.

I heard my mom pick it up in the hallway. A few seconds of silence. Then a small, fractured whimper slipped out of her mouth. My skin stood up.¬†

‚ÄúWait, what? No, no, no, what happened?‚Äù she stammered.

That was enough. My anger toward her evaporated. She might‚Äôve been hiding something, but she was still my mother, and right now, she sounded like a frightened child. I stepped out into the hallway just as she was pulling on her coat with frantic, jerky movements.

‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I asked, my voice thin. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

She turned to me, eyes red, phone still clutched in her hand.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been an accident,‚Äù she said. Her voice cracked on the last word.

There were tears already, but I didn‚Äôt know if they were from me, or the phone call, or both. The details came during the drive. Barely strung-together thoughts between panicked breaths.

‚ÄúYour father was in a car crash,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey said a truck. Some truck hit him. A bad one. He‚Äôs at the hospital.‚Äù

I said nothing. Just watched the blur of passing headlights and shadows out the window. Everything felt slowed down. Muffled. Like I‚Äôd been dropped underwater. An unfortunately familiar feeling for me recently.¬†

When we got to the hospital, I found out what really happened. He‚Äôd been sideswiped by a truck, some distracted driver on his phone, apparently. The driver walked away with a broken wrist. But Dad‚Ä¶ Dad had taken the full impact. They put him into a medically induced coma ‚Äúfor his own safety,‚Äù the doctors said. Their voices were calm. Practiced. Rehearsed for hundreds of nights like this one.

I listened in pieces. It was all just noise‚Äîsoft voices, sliding doors, papers shuffling. I didn‚Äôt cry. I didn‚Äôt feel much of anything. If anything, I felt absent. Like I‚Äôd slipped a few feet outside of my own body. Watching a movie I didn‚Äôt want to see.

We waited. For hours.

Sympathetic looks came from every direction. Nurses smiled with sad eyes. Doctors patted shoulders and used the word Champ. No one said it out loud, but everyone in that waiting room knew what kind of night this was.

My mom barely spoke. She held a balled-up tissue in one hand, trembling, as if it were the only thing tethering her to this reality. I wanted to comfort her. But I didn‚Äôt move. I just stared ahead. Thinking about the last conversation I‚Äôd had with Dad. The *only* honest one we might have ever had. I had asked him a question. One question. And I got an answer I didn‚Äôt understand. Now I felt like I may never speak with him again.¬†

They let us see him at 11:04 p.m.

I remember the exact time, because I looked at the red digital clock in the hallway and felt a jolt, just like the alarm clock in my room. Red numbers. Always red.¬†

The room was filled with a quiet symphony of mechanical life support. A soft, pulsing beep. The sound of suction. An oxygen machine that sighed and inhaled, like something alive. Like something waiting.

He was lying there. My dad.

His face was covered in a cascade of bruises and shallow cuts. There were bandages, dried blood at the edges, IVs in both arms. But it was still him. Still *Dad*. Not broken. Just‚Ä¶ still.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù my mom whispered, stepping toward him like he might wake at the sound.

I stood behind her. Frozen.

The machines beeped, slow and steady, like a metronome counting the seconds of life passing by.¬†

¬†felt something shift in my chest. Not sadness exactly. Something colder.

His clothes were folded neatly in a clear plastic bin labeled with a thin white tag. Personal Effects it read. Something about that phrase made my stomach turn. Like he was already gone.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to look. But I did.

Among the blood-speckled shirt and crumpled jeans, I saw something gleam faintly in the harsh hospital lighting, something metallic, half-buried in the folds. My heart jumped.

Keys.

I glanced at Mom. She was standing at the edge of Dad‚Äôs bed, wiping her eyes, trying to be brave. Trying to look strong for both of us. But I wasn‚Äôt watching her out of sympathy. I was watching her to make sure she didn‚Äôt see me.

I reached down casually, slid my hand into the container, and felt around until my finger looped through the keyring. I closed my hand tightly, muffling the soft jingle of metal, and slipped the whole thing into my coat pocket in one smooth motion. Cold steel. Heavy with purpose.

‚ÄúHey, Mom,‚Äù I said, forcing a tremble into my voice like I was holding back tears.

‚ÄúYes, hun?‚Äù she replied quickly, looking over her shoulder with a practiced smile. It didn‚Äôt touch her eyes.

‚ÄúCould I, could I get some water or something?‚Äù I asked, fumbling for more words, trying to sell it. ‚ÄúMaybe step outside for a minute. Just‚Ä¶ some air.‚Äù

She nodded without hesitation. ‚ÄúOf course. That‚Äôs probably a good idea,‚Äù she said, brushing at her cheeks with a tissue. ‚ÄúGo ahead. I‚Äôll be right here.‚Äù

I turned and walked out without another word. The second I was in the hallway, I picked up speed, not running, but not walking slow enough to get stopped. My thoughts were loud. Deafening. The keys felt like they were burning a hole in my pocket.

I found the first staff member I could, an older woman behind a counter, peering at a screen and sipping from a hospital-branded coffee cup.

‚ÄúHi,‚Äù I said, trying to sound casual. ‚ÄúIs Mrs. Pierce working tonight?‚Äù

She looked at me, surprised, then nodded and picked up a phone. A few short calls. A few moments of waiting.

Then, around the corner, she appeared.

Alex‚Äôs mom.

‚ÄúOh, Sam,‚Äù she said, walking up with open arms, ‚ÄúI heard what happened. I‚Äôm so, so sorry, sweetheart.‚Äù

Her hug was warm, but I didn‚Äôt feel it.¬†

She pulled back, keeping her hands gently on my shoulders.

‚ÄúYour dad‚Äôs strong. And this hospital‚Äôs one of the best. The doctors here‚Ä¶‚Äù she gave me a little smile, trying to lift the moment, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre basically wizards, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúOr witches,‚Äù I said, without thinking. The words slid out, dry and bitter.

‚ÄúCould you give me a ride home?‚Äù I asked.¬†

**Chapter 10**

After telling Mom that Mrs. Pierce would be driving me home, we left. It was a long, silent ride. I didn‚Äôt try to talk much, and I couldn‚Äôt have told you anything she said if you asked me. I was somewhere else, already halfway down the hallway, staring at the red door in my mind.

I got home around midnight. The house looked the same, but it felt completely different. My own house had never scared me like this. It was too quiet, too dark. But not empty.

Something was still inside. I knew it.

I unlocked the front door. My hand trembled. As I stepped inside, I had this vivid flash, just for a moment of something standing in the garage window, waving.

I didn‚Äôt lock the door behind me.

I walked slowly through the quiet house. Past the kitchen. Past the living room. Down the long hallway.

Until I stood before the red door.

That door had been a shadow cast across my entire childhood. A question no one ever answered. A giant red threat dressed up like a little white lie.¬†

My hand reached up, almost on its own. I slid the deadbolt open. I inserted my father‚Äôs key into the lock and turned. It clicked.

I paused. I prayed, silently, foolishly, that I‚Äôd open the door and see nothing but a garage. My father‚Äôs dusty old pickup. Tools. Paint cans. Normal things.

I opened the door.

Behind it was a narrow space. A short passage. On the other side was another identical red door.

To the right: a thin, crumbling staircase made of old brick, leading down into pitch-black darkness. A single metal chain dangled from the ceiling like a forgotten noose.

I pulled it. Click.

The lights buzzed and flickered to life, revealing the start of something ancient. Something hidden.

Each step I took down the stairs made the air feel heavier, thicker, older. Like I was walking into something that had been sealed away for centuries. At the bottom of the steps was a small stone corridor. Around the corner, I entered a large underground room.

It was damp and cold, and it reeked like rot and mildew and death. The walls were stone, stained dark. The floor was littered with trash: torn food wrappers, pizza boxes, old cans, and bags of salt.

And in the center of the room‚Ä¶ was a well.

A stone well, about three feet high, open and roofless, like something torn out of a fairytale, but there was nothing magical about it. It was surrounded by a perfect circle of white salt.

Until I stepped too close and accidentally kicked some of the salt away, breaking the ring.

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

‚ÄúHello‚Ä¶‚Äù came a voice from inside the well.

I stumbled back, gasping.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I answered, my voice shaking.

‚ÄúWho's there?‚Äù the voice asked, hoarse and ragged.

‚ÄúS-Sam,‚Äù I said, barely able to get the word out.

‚ÄúWill you help me, Sam?‚Äù

The voice sounded scared. Tired. Human. Not some cackling hag like I had imagined all my life. It was a woman. A person.

‚ÄúSo you're real,‚Äù I said, eyes welling up with terrified tears. ‚ÄúThere really is a witch...‚Äù

The voice whimpered. ‚ÄúI'm not a witch, Sam.‚Äù She was crying now, deep, anguished sobs echoing up from the stone. ‚ÄúI'm a prisoner.‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt speak. My hands were shaking violently.

‚ÄúYour father‚Ä¶ he's kept me down here for years. Please. Help me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I finally managed to ask.

‚ÄúMy name is Sarah,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Danny‚Äôs mother.‚Äù

The room spun. My knees buckled. My breath caught in my throat.

Danny‚Äôs mother. The one who‚Äôd *disappeared*. The one they said *ran away*. The one Danny never talked about.

‚ÄúWait here,‚Äù I said, voice cracking. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to call the police. I‚Äôm going to call Danny.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, wait,‚Äù she pleaded. ‚ÄúSometimes‚Ä¶ sometimes your father lowers a rope for food or clothes, when he‚Äôs feeling merciful. It‚Äôs already tied. Please, just drop it down. I've been down here far too long.‚Äù

I grabbed the coil of rope from the corner. It was already anchored to the wall, knotted expertly like it had been used many times before.

I tossed it into the well.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back,‚Äù I promised, already running, sprinting up the stairs, through the red door, slamming it shut behind me out of instinct. My hands flew across drawers and cupboards until I found the small phone book my mom still kept.

*Danny - Home.*

I dialed the number. My heart was in my throat. The phone rang.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Danny answered.

‚ÄúDanny, it‚Äôs Sam,‚Äù I gasped, tears flooding my face.

‚ÄúOh hey, man, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found her,‚Äù I cried. ‚ÄúYour mom. She didn‚Äôt leave. She didn‚Äôt run away. She‚Äôs here, Danny. She‚Äôs been under my house this whole time.‚Äù

There was silence on the other end.

Then, finally, Danny laughed, but not a happy laugh. A confused one.

‚ÄúSam‚Ä¶ my mom‚Äôs in rehab.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, she‚Äôs not. I just talked to her. She said that my dad locked her away. Danny, you said she disappeared‚Äù

‚ÄúShe did man. Years ago. She was gone for a while, but she came back. She‚Äôs getting better now. I saw her last weekend. We go visit every other Sunday.‚Äù

My breath stopped.

The phone slipped from my hand and hit the kitchen floor with a dull crack.

Downstairs‚Ä¶ in the dark‚Ä¶ a rope was being pulled taut.

And someone‚Ä¶¬† something was climbing up.

1mehyz2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mehyz2,Three pot comparison,"Comparison of pots

Grosche black alum 9 cup

Ditosh stainless 9 cup

Grosche plain alum 9 cup

Internal machining/surface finish of the Ditosh is a bead blasted esque look to it. Steel is thin but not overly so. Out of the box the lid wouldn't rest flat, easily fixed with some strategic prying with a screwdriver. Is much lighter than the aluminum ones - I could see maybe bringing this camping if the hike wasn't too long.

The difference in internal finish work between the two Grosche bases is somewhat stark. The black pot base has obvious surface effects from the rough casting. Also one can clearly see the facets in the inside. The base on the plain alum pot has been machined uniform bottom to top, interior is smooth cylindrical - presumably it has more aluminum/heavier base. 

Exterior surface quality fit and finish of both Grosche pots are very nice. 

All three pots are somewhat comparable in terms of brewing time, the Ditosh needs to be heated at a slightly lower setting on my elec stove. 

Second run cycles reusing the same grounds, reveal all three pots are getting a good extraction on the first pass (resulting brew was the color of weak tea). All make passable brew. The plain Grosche seems to brew the best. At the end of a cycle, it throws any stray steam out and down slightly - you can leave the lid up without splashing. 

The black Grosche spits remaining steam out and up, all over the place if the lid is up. Not sure why these pots are *any* different in function...

Ditosh brews a respectable cup with one drawback - it fires any residual steam down onto the surface of the coffee, destroying immediately any foam that's been produced.

As a practical consideration, very little foam makes it into the cup anyway, but it *is* something to keep in mind.

 Brewing a cup of strong coffee to go into cake batter I'll be baking tonight.

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôm a woman currently visiting Nairobi from a Middle Eastern country. I‚Äôve been here for a couple of months and usually get my coffee from Artcaff√©‚Äîspecifically the Westlands Market branch, since it‚Äôs one of the few that‚Äôs open 24 hours (and I‚Äôm used to drinking coffee late, ‚ÄúMiddle Eastern style‚Äù).

Most of the staff are lovely and respectful, but there‚Äôs one tall guy who brings orders to people waiting outside in their cars. I barely interact with him, but whenever I‚Äôve asked him something, he just gives me a weird look and walks away. I never took it personally‚Ä¶ until today.

I sat outside with my coffee to finish some paperwork. I was at a shared seating area with two tables pushed together‚Äîthe only space available. Suddenly, that same guy walked up and said, ‚ÄúI want this table,‚Äù then grabbed my stuff aggressively and moved it to the other table without even asking. I was sitting with my legs on the end of the second table, and he actually hurt my leg doing that. No ‚Äúexcuse me,‚Äù no explanation, just straight-up rude behavior.

I let it go at first, thinking maybe someone urgently needed the table. Later, I asked him politely if he could help move the remaining table a bit closer to the wall‚Äîhe looked me up and down, said nothing, and walked away.

That was the last straw.

I spoke to his manager, who apologized and called him over. I calmly asked the employee, ‚ÄúWhy do you treat me this way? Did I do something wrong?‚Äù He replied, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you.‚Äù I asked again, and he repeated the same line. Eventually, he told me, ‚ÄúTake your stuff and go home,‚Äù and turned to the manager like I wasn‚Äôt even there.

I told him, ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt treat people with respect, you should go home b ‚Äù The manager apologized again, and I left.

So now I‚Äôm asking:
Is this kind of behavior normal there ? 
What‚Äôs the best way to deal with this kind of situation‚Äîespecially when the manager doesn‚Äôt really do anything about it?
And what u would do as visitor !

So I‚Äôm a server in a small town in Arkansas that was recently just bought by a couple(50m 50f). I only been in the area for 3 years and work at the restaurant since I was 20, now I‚Äôm 23. 

   I was fired today 45 minutes before my shift (I went in at 5 pm) with a phone call saying I was spreading rumors about how the new owners are having relationships problems and that they are running the restaurant down, outside of work. Obviously, I denied those claims because it wasn‚Äôt true. When I had asked about these said rumors they barely glossed over it and said they had 2 exterior people come in and tell them this. I asked again exactly what the rumors were and they didn‚Äôt provide any details.
   
I also want to add that since they own the restaurant, they let a manager (30F) cut my shifts down to 3 day which includes two morning (where I make less then minimum wage and I had to walk out with only 40 bucks or even less at times) and 1 night which was the slowest night. One month was so bad that I couldn‚Äôt even make my rent. They let this manager spread rumors and talk about me to other servers. When I had a discussion with the husband he said he‚Äôll put an end to it and that never happened. 

  One of the owners (50 f) will drink on the job (every night) with multiple coffee mugs full of beer and is usually drunk by the time I clock out. The night my boyfriend worked and I didn‚Äôt, the owner (50 f) was drunk and telling him that our relationship wasn‚Äôt going to work and wanted him to know this. She said this multiple times that night and said that me and his brother had a thing with each other. Obviously that claim was false, since she never met his brother nor did I ever had anything going on with my boyfriend‚Äôs brother. 

 And finally, the owner (50 m.. husband) would call me either a Mexican or a Mexicant because he knew that would upset me. I‚Äôm half Puerto Rican and I would always correct him when he did call me Mexican/ Mexicant. I verbally told him to stop calling me a Mexican, but he continued on.
   I‚Äôm sorry that this is long, but I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve never been fired from a job before and I feel like the reason for that termination is wrong. Is there any legal advice someone can give me? I would really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

It feels bloated and overweight. The extra mass, extra width and higher belt line makes it feel much bigger than the b9. It also lost a lot of the precise handling feel. Much more of a boat, like an A6, which definitely isn‚Äôt a compliment.

I hate the tech. The stupid animation of cars surrounding on the dashboard is distracting, and apparently there‚Äôs no way to turn it off. In the b9 there was a ‚Äúvirtual cockpit‚Äù function that had a classic layout of just tach and speed. Hopefully there‚Äôs something similar and I haven‚Äôt found it yet. The massive curved display takes way too much of the FOV. The passenger side screen isn‚Äôt active, maybe I need to buy a subscription or something? 

Center console volume knob is now in front of the cup holder, so you have to reach around your coffee or water bottle to get it instead of being right at your finger tips. Steering wheel volume is now a cheesy feeling plastic button instead of the previous scroll wheel. Fail on both.

Motor response is similar, but the exhaust is so much less engaging. The b9 snapped and snarled and warmed my heart. 

No center shifter, just the little rocker button. Feels like a miss. In a sporty car, I want a shifter! 

HVAC has no buttons. I really don‚Äôt want to open a menu screen to turn the fan up.

The combo mirror and seat control on the armrest is way too fiddly. Like 6 different functions that aren‚Äôt clear while driving. You have to look at the tiny icons to find the mirror adjust.

Reliability: I have 84 miles total and it‚Äôs already thrown a check engine light and a transmission error. ‚ÄúPark function not available. Contact service‚Äù. JFC, REALLY?! So I can drive a loaner Q3 for a month?

Conclusion: user experience fail and yet another low bar for quality. Why do I keep going back?! I should have bought a Lexus.",5,1754006648.0,Audi,10,0.73,False
1mehphz,https://i.redd.it/85cdqag9uagf1.jpeg,My retirement.,"Since retirement, I've learned to slow down and live a leisurely and quiet life. Every morning, I brew a cup of strong coffee, sit in a rattan chair on the balcony, and quietly watch the morning light stream in. The sun is gentle, the birds chirp softly, and time seems to have become loose and soft.

No longer chasing deadlines for clients and cases, or arguing over the finer details of clauses in conference rooms. Instead, I enjoy leisurely strolls through the nearby park, accompanied by my elderly dog. The air is filled with the fragrance of flowers and plants, and my footsteps gently touch the fallen leaves, each step imbued with the tranquility of time.

Occasionally, I open a book, reading literature or contemporary legal texts, to keep my mind active but relieve the tension and anxiety. In the evenings, I enjoy sitting down with my family, chatting about the little things in life. Occasionally, I'll answer calls from legal and public service organizations, helping those in need and continuing my old sense of duty and mission.

Life has become simpler, yet richer. Slowing down allows us to see the often overlooked beauty of life. Retirement is not the end, but the beginning of a new, more peaceful life.",1,1754006637.0,justeicemessenger,0,1.0,False
1mehoyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1mehoyh/i_recently_made_an_api_called_chapybara_designed/,"I recently made an API called **Chapybara**, designed to give you powerful, deep insights into IP addresses and domain names. (100 free credits, no CC)","Hey everyone!

I hate self-promotion posts, but I really need your help to get this project off the ground.

Honestly, I have a few projects that need reliable IP and domain intelligence, especially Secure Check (https://securecheck.live), which I posted about a few days ago. My friends and I each create side projects, and we try to keep costs low by using our own tools shared between us. We always found ourselves needing reliable IP intelligence for our coding endeavors. But finding solutions that were both powerful \*and\* truly developer-friendly, without crazy contracts, opaque pricing, good limits, and good pricing, felt like a quest!

So I decided to build it myself, and now I want to share it with you!

\* ¬† \*\*Comprehensive Insights:\*\* Get rich data on anything from geolocation, DNS records, and WHOIS details to SSL/TLS certificates, web technologies, and even security threat detection (identifying things like phishing, malware, VPNs, and Tor exit nodes).  
\* ¬† \*\*A ""Friends with the Customer"" Approach:\*\* I'm not a big corporation; I'm just like you. I believe in being transparent, simple, and creating affordable solutions. Each API call costs just 1 credit, and your credits \*\*never expire\*\*. You truly just pay for what you use‚Äîno hidden fees, no monthly subscription. Credits start at \*\*$0.0004\*\* per credit; our lowest tier offers 10K credits for \*\*$4\*\*. For higher usage, tiers go up to 5 million credits, with each credit costing just \*\*$0.00022\*\*.

\*\*I need your help to get started!\*\*

Chapybara is still very much in active development, and we're on a journey towards our official V1.0 release. To be fully transparent, I'm currently running it on a subdomain because, well, I can't quite afford a dedicated domain for Chapybara just yet! Lol.

This is where you come in! I'm looking for early adopters and friendly developers to jump in, use our API, and help us refine it. Your feedback during this phase will be invaluable in shaping Chapybara into the best tool it can be.

\*\*Important details for early access:\*\*

\* ¬† \*\*Free Credits:\*\* Every new account gets \*\*100 free API credits\*\* to play with‚Äîabsolutely no credit card needed to get started.  
\* ¬† \*\*API Stability & Pricing:\*\* Since we're pre-V1.0, the API response format \*might\* evolve as we integrate feedback and add features. We appreciate your understanding with this! However, one thing we can guarantee is our pricing model: it will \*\*always stay the same or get lower\*\*, never higher. We want to build long-term relationships, not just customers.  
\*   \*\*Problems?\*\* You can send me a message here on Reddit or via email: [suporte@alphasystem.dev](mailto:suporte@alphasystem.dev)

\*\*Purchasing credits before V1.0:\*\*  
If you like what I'm building and want to support me by purchasing more credits, I'd be incredibly grateful! Just please consider buying in smaller amounts for now. Every purchase goes directly into paying for coffee, funding the project, and covering the tech costs to keep Chapybara running (hopefully on a dedicated server and domain soon). Because of this, I might not be able to offer refunds before we hit version 1.0. I hope you understand, and I appreciate your faith in this project!

Your support and feedback will genuinely help me take Chapybara to the next level.

1mehkot,https://www.axios.com/2025/07/30/trump-tariffs-de-minimis-copper-brazil,"Trump ends de minimis exemption for tariffs, imposes copper, Brazil levies","President Trump on Wednesday took another sweeping series of tariff actions, formally imposing new levies on copper and Brazil and revoking a global exemption on tariffs for packages worth less than $800.

Ending the so-called de minimis exemption will make low-price goods from around the world more expensive for American consumers.

The suspension was already in place for China and had a serious impact on major Chinese retailers like Shein and Temu.

The copper levy will increase prices substantially on one of the most vital metals to the American economy.

The Brazil tariff threatens American staples like coffee and orange juice.

After months of on-off trade policy, Trump is barreling firmly ahead with this Friday's deadline to broadly raise, or impose, tariffs on key goods and major allies.

The so-called TACO trade (""Trump Always Chickens Out"") is not in evidence here, with the administration sticking firmly so far to the August 1 tariff plan.

The de minimis exemption will end on August 29, the White House said.

For goods shipped through the international postal system, packages will be taxed in one of two ways.

""Ad valorem duty"": a duty ""equal to the effective tariff rate imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) that is applicable to the country of origin of the product.""

Or, ""specific duty"": Ranging from $80 per item to $200 per item, depending on the effective IEEPA tariff rate ""applicable to the country of origin of the product.""

After six months, however, ""all applicable shipments must comply with the ad valorem duty methodology. ""

American travelers can still ""bring back up to $200 in personal items and individuals can continue to receive bona fide gifts valued at $100 or less duty-free,"" however.

On Wednesday Trump also finalized new 50% tariffs for Brazil as of Friday.

In an executive order, Trump defended his ally, former president Jair Bolsonaro, accusing the current Brazilian government of ""politically motivated persecution, intimidation, harassment, censorship, and prosecution"" of Bolsonaro and ""thousands of his supporters.""

By the numbers: Trump's order finalizing the new 50% tariff on copper imports caused the metal to plunge, with futures dropping almost 20%.

That would represent the biggest single-day decline in decades.

1mehk24,https://i.redd.it/eyvc3uf6hagf1.png,[Multiple Games] July platinums! My favorites were Best Served Cold and Pepper Grinder.,"The games, alphabetically:

* **Ape Escape: On the Loose** \- Probably the most ill-conceived remake I've ever played. The original is a 3D platformer designed around the dual analog sticks of the PS1's DualShock controller-- I'm not sure what compelled them to port it to the single-sticked PSP, or to put that version on PS+ Premium when the original was already there. Just play that instead.
* **Best Served Cold** \- A detective visual novel set in a speakeasy at the tail end of an alt-history roaring '20s. Manage your customers' inebriation and tell them what they want to hear to coax out clues and solve a series of murders. If you've played the Coffee Talk games since they were added to PS+ Extra, think those with more meat and better writing.
* **Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons Remake** \- I still haven't beaten Split Fiction, but unless that game *really* sticks the landing, this IMO remains Josef Fares' best game. The remake isn't great, overhauling visuals to mixed results and adding a self-sabotaging co-op mode, but at least this time there's a platinum!
* **Fantasian: Neo Dimension** \- A fixed-perspective, turn-based JRPG from Final Fantasy vets Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu. It has a lot of interesting ideas with regard to combat mechanics and art direction, but the execution doesn't live up to its pedigree.
* **Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings** \- Yeah I don't think anybody really likes this one. My SO and I have been on an Indiana Jones marathon, so I thought it would be fun to play through this before starting the Great Circle. If nothing else, it was at least cool to see a post-Uncharted action/adventure designed for the then-aged PS2. 
* **I.Q. Intelligent Qube / Kurushi** \- An arcade puzzle classic from the PS1, and by far the best of the PS+ classics I played this month. My dumb ass had a harder time with it than most seem to, but it definitely holds up well once you get a feel for it.
* **Monument Valley II** \- I enjoyed this one a lot! It's a narrative puzzle game that leans more on dazzling with strong art direction and impossible geometry than on its actual mechanics, but it does so to great enough effect that you hardly even notice that you're not really *doing* all that much. Certainly not the best puzzle game I've ever played, but best mobile game? It's in the running.
* **Pepper Grinder** \- A fast-paced 2D platformer that has you swimming through the earth like a dolphin in waves. This is the closest game I've played in a decade to Rayman Origins/Legends, and I'd recommend it in a heartbeat to any fan of those games (the former was my first plat, way back in the day!). 
* **Planet of Lana** \- A modern cinematic platformer in the vein of Limbo/Inside. Puzzle, art, and audio design are all strong at worst, and some of the setpieces are truly stunning. It's a very close third-favorite for this month, and second-favorite of the genre behind American Arcadia.",0,1754006244.0,Trophies,0,0.5,False
1mehjy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mehjy4/i_spit_out_the_drink_that_was_meant_to_kill_me/,I Spit Out the Drink That Was Meant to Kill Me ... Now I Regret It,"I didn‚Äôt think one sip would change everything.

It started at a gas station just outside Denver. I‚Äôd been driving cross-country to reset my life. New job, new city, no baggage. Just me, the road, and the radio.

I stopped to stretch my legs and grab a drink. The cooler was half-empty‚Äîprobably hadn‚Äôt been restocked in a week. One bottle caught my eye: black plastic, no label except a small red triangle printed on the cap. No brand name, no ingredients. Just that triangle.

I should‚Äôve known better.

But it was cold, and I was thirsty. I twisted the cap, and as soon as I raised it to my lips, I smelled it‚Äîsomething off. Sweet, but too sweet. Like rotting fruit drowned in cough syrup.

Still, I took a sip.

The taste was *wrong*. Metallic, bitter, almost‚Ä¶ dusty. I gagged, spit it onto the floor, and dropped the bottle.

The cashier looked at me like I‚Äôd thrown a grenade.

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù he snapped, rushing out from behind the counter.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs wrong with that drink,‚Äù I said, wiping my mouth.

He stared at the puddle. Then at me. Then at the bottle.

And then he *ran*.

I stood there stunned as the door jingled behind him. I waited a few seconds, called out‚Äînothing. Finally, I walked outside and saw his car peel out of the lot, tires screaming.

That‚Äôs when the fear crept in. That bottle wasn‚Äôt just bad. It was *meant* to be bad.

That night, I didn‚Äôt sleep. I kept thinking about the triangle. I searched the internet for hours‚ÄîReddit, weird forums, conspiracy threads‚Äîbut nothing useful. Just dead ends and half-baked urban legends.

The next morning, I hit the road again.

By afternoon, a black SUV had been behind me for over 60 miles. Every turn I took, it took. Every exit, it followed. Finally, I pulled off into a crowded strip mall. The SUV parked two rows down.

Three men got out. All in black suits, wearing mirrored sunglasses. No smiles. No talking. Just scanning.

I ditched my car and ran.

That was six days ago.

Since then, I‚Äôve been hiding in motels, moving every night. The black SUVs keep finding me. Sometimes they don‚Äôt bother hiding. Sometimes they knock on the door pretending to be cops, or hotel staff, or delivery guys. I stopped answering. I stopped sleeping. I can barely eat.

One night I found a thread on a dark web forum. Someone else mentioned the triangle. Said it‚Äôs part of something called *The Selection*.

They didn‚Äôt explain it, but they said this:

""Drink it and die in peace. Spit it out, and you‚Äôre *prey*.‚Äù

I replied. Begged for answers. They sent me a private message:

""Every year, they manufacture 1,000 unmarked bottles. They‚Äôre placed at random locations across the U.S.‚Äîgas stations, vending machines, cafes. Most drink and die instantly. Quiet, clean. No mess. No questions.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut if you reject the Offering‚Ä¶ they come.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know who *they* are.

I‚Äôve been stabbed once, chased four times, and drugged in a motel coffee this morning. (I only drank half before I smelled the same syrupy scent.)

They‚Äôre not trying to kill me quickly. They want fear. Exhaustion. Panic. I think I ruined something sacred. I rejected their sacrament.

And now they‚Äôre enjoying the hunt.

I haven‚Äôt seen my reflection in three days. I‚Äôm afraid of what I‚Äôll see‚Äîhow much I‚Äôve changed. How hollow I‚Äôve become.

If you find a drink with a red triangle on the cap‚Äî**don‚Äôt sip it. Don‚Äôt open it. Walk away.**

Because if you spit it out‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll never stop running.

And they never stop hunting.",16,1754006235.0,nosleep,1,0.95,False

I would prefer to avoid cutting him but I will if absolutely need be. I have repotted him twice and he just keeps getting bigger.

I am deeply attached to this plant ( I spend a lot of time talking/singing to him) and would feel really bad about ruining all the work he put into growing his beautiful vines.
He was recently cut down some due to cat damage. (they did not eat any just sat on the plant and broke several vines :( )
I would also love any advice regarding better pots and fertilizer for him!
He currently gets watered every week/two weeks, with the tomatoe miracle grow and (glass vase ifkyk) water every like 2-3 months, I also give him coffee grounds like once a year starting last year.
He is an indoor only plant now due to his size but when he was smaller I would take him outside when watering so he could get some good sunlight.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a *roar*\-dinating showdown as Pumas UNAM square off against Atlanta United in the 2025 Leagues Cup. On paper, Pumas are slight underdogs, but the odds tell a different story. Let‚Äôs dissect this with the precision of a surgeon who‚Äôs never actually held a scalpel.

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Real Underdog?

The bookmakers have Atlanta as the +310 underdog (decimal 3.1) and Pumas as the -205 favorite (decimal 2.05). Translating that into plain English: Pumas are the clear favorites, despite the initial claim they‚Äôre ‚Äúslight underdogs.‚Äù Maybe someone mixed up the coffee order at the sportsbook. Either way, the math is unambiguous. Pumas have a 48.78% implied chance to win, while Atlanta‚Äôs at 32.26%‚Äîand the draw? A paltry 26.97%. If this were a high-stakes poker game, Atlanta would already be all-in on hope.

The over 2.5 goals line sits at 2.75, with odds hovering around 1.86-1.96. Given Atlanta‚Äôs torrid season‚Äîfive of their last seven matches have eclipsed 2.5 goals‚Äîit‚Äôs a virtual guarantee that someone will miss a penalty or a defender will trip over their own shoelaces.

### Digesting the News: A Tale of Two Seasons

Pumas, fresh off a hard-fought penalty shootout victory over Orlando City, have rediscovered their form after a rocky start. Their hero? Adalberto Carrasquilla, who‚Äôs become as reliable as a rooster announcing dawn. Goalkeeper Keylor Navas? He‚Äôs the human equivalent of a fire extinguisher‚Äîunseen until chaos erupts.

Atlanta, meanwhile, are the soccer version of a broken toaster: persistent, sparky, and likely to start a fire. Their 3-1 loss to Necaxa earlier this tournament was highlighted by an own goal from Brad Guzan, who might want to invest in a personal goalie f

It‚Äôs great to find a supportive community and like minded people. It‚Äôs been very motivating.

A few years ago I did a 105-day fast and lost 75lb. My diet was Dr. supervised and I really enjoyed the experience, much to my surprise. In fact, after a few weeks I asked my Dr. how I could feel as good fasting when eating.

I maintained my weight for quite a while but a with bout of depression and ‚Äúlife stuff‚Äù I ended up gaining much of it back.

I‚Äôm considering doing another long-term fast soon here and am finding the info here super helpful! The guidance on electrolytes is particular useful. The system I came up for myself involved electrolyte drinks, vitamins and bullion. It worked but I sometimes had diarrhea and, from what I‚Äôm reading here, I may have not been getting enough potassium.

I guess my style might be considered ‚Äúdirty‚Äù fasting (black coffee, bullion, spices, and some sugar free sodas allowed) but I found it to work well and be sustainable long-term. My general rule was to make sure I did nothing to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù my digestive tract.

I was wondering if anyone has ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù on how to integrate sodium and potassium into a ‚Äúdirty‚Äù fast? (zero or nearly zero calorie options.)

I‚Äôm experimenting with black coffee, salt a little stevia and cinnamon, for instance.

I switched to a Phillips superauto about 4-5 years ago and I lie to myself that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad‚Äù every time I use it. Im using it less and less, which means I‚Äôm having to clean it nearly every time to stop or remove the (impossible to see) mold and mildew that builds up. It‚Äôs high maintenance, the espresso was always undrinkable, and - at this point - I basically have a $500 machine whose only good drink is a hot chocolate using the LatteGo function. My Vario and V60 are my primary coffee tools atm. 

Let‚Äôs say I have a target of under $2.5k street price before tax/shipping, I‚Äôm willing to go a bit higher, and/or I‚Äôm willing to wait for a sale or bare my contact info for a ‚Äúnew user‚Äù coupon. I‚Äôve got all the 58mm gear from my Crossland. I‚Äôm not really willing to flash out for a new/more expensive grinder, and I‚Äôm willing to limit my espresso game to that because I‚Äôm a lazy mfer and I could get what I consider a solid 7.5-8 cup out of my Crossland. I‚Äôm literally not willing to work harder. 

Given a perfect setup, I might drink espresso 20% of the time, 78% Americano, and 2% a capp or latte. I don‚Äôt really need it, but I almost certainly want a double boiler. Remember, I‚Äôm lazy. I also have the ability and desire to plumb it in, both source and drain if at all possible. Again, lazy. 

But not so lazy I‚Äôm willing to give over to a super; not even a good one. I would prefer a PID temp system and probably some programmable pre-infusion and shot timing. But I still enjoy and appreciate the process. Enough that I‚Äôm willing to pretend I enjoy watching and controlling the pull, with no *need* for the technical precision of scales or external, multiple timers. 

From a quick browse, the Lelit Bianca ($3k) seems to fit, though I can‚Äôt tell if it can take supply plumbing. Im also a bit concerned about their purchase by Breville. I‚Äôm curious what else I should be looking at, if there are competitors in the range. I‚Äôm willing to wire for 220/240 if it makes my search easier or cheaper.

Yes, I really have no say in what happens, but my boyfriend's ex-wife spends so much less time with her kid than I do. He has even admired me at school in a meeting. I try to help out the best I can. 


I have so many questions. I like my boyfriend's kid- I do. But I make 1/3, if not less of what his dad (my bf) makes. We've been together 2 1/2 years. I've changed careers from being a bartender(double/triple what I make now to a desk job so I can hang out with my boyfriend.) He buys extravagant stuff for dinner all of the time. Steak, crab legs, crab cakes, homemade brisket, homemade pulled pork, homemade brisket chili, soup, etc. ). He used to take us out to eat all of the time, but since he bought a $3,000 new puppy, a $2,000 new coffee machine and a Harley that he worked on himself, plus inflation, he usually bitches about the money he spends on me and him going out to eat. I feel obligated to cashapp him for half, even if his kid eats with us. I feel bad setting that boundary because I do get such extravagant dinners. 

He buys me flowers, i know I'm not really helping with the mortgage, and he buys stuff for the house. But I don't really know what to do anymore. I've also cashapped him for some of the groceries he's bought- he charges me $750 to live with him, and he pays the $3,500 mortgage. I understand there is a financial difference, but setting boundaries has been very difficult. If i say I'm only paying for 1/3 of dinner, he brings up the past extravagant dinners he's made me. And lately, we rarely do date nights anymore. His kid lives with him 90% of the time. What are the boundaries supposed to be for date night? I've tried not to feel resentment over us going out to eat tonight, but it's hard to be excited about his kid coming along to one of our favorite spots. And the obligation i feel to cashapp him for my portion of food so he doesn't feel like he has a second kid is overwhelming. I guess what I'm asking is- how do you set boundaries in a relationship where you dont make the same amount of money and where one of you has a kid and the other doesn't?

I'm open to suggestions, advice, or your experience in detoxing some of these if you have anything similar on your list.   
  
The Problem:  
For the last several months, and increasingly so in the last few weeks, my ability to concentrate on what is in front of me, be in a state of presence, and make decisions as diminished - drastically. 

I feel a relief in knowing just how much this has been running my life. I think after 10+ years of social media usage on touch screen phones, plus life just being challenging in so many unpredictable ways, it finally got the best of me. 

Felt Experience:  
It's feeling like anything in front of me, is far away, less dense, almost less pixelated. There's definitely some dissociation happening here, and i'll add that in addition to a dopamine detox I must focus on embodiment as well (stretching for instance). It's getting really bad, where I feel like I'd rather space out and do nothing, then try to fight through the concentration challenges. 

My Dopamine Habits / Addictions:  
1.) YouTube Scrolling and Watching - Like a slot machine, each time I scroll maybe the next video's thumbnail and title will speak to me enough to click, and hold my attention. Maybe I'll get a dopamine hit from the content itself, until its over and I need another video to fill the void.   
2.) Reddit - Scrolling on my phone is an issue. (I'm more productive with it on monitor)  
3.) Instant Gratification - Biting /pulling at my nails. This is a way for me to also do something with my body.   
4.) Constant Music - I never allow silence. I always have music playing. I'm a top user on spotify that's how serious it is how much I listen to music.   
5.) Substances - Smoke weed (daily) and drink coffee (daily).  
6.) Thought Loops / Idealistic Fantasies - I'll literally think on repeat about the same shit that bothers me, and I honestly think it gives me a dopamine hit because it makes me believe I'm making a different when really I'm dwelling on situations I have no power over and very little clarity.   
7.) ChatGPT - I got super hooked on using this for all kinds of research, reflection, inquiry etc the last 6 months. I think the instant mirroring and info dumping majorly pushed the dopamine addiction to a new level. 

What I want:  
Is to be able to sit down and do some art for awhile. Work on my passion projects. Be present when I'm cooking. Feel like I'm actually in my body and not in a brain fogged mental state. To feel like MYSELF AGAIN. This has gotten out of hand and is literally starting to scare me. 

Changes:  
\> YouTube - Cancelling YT Premium. THe ads alone will stop me from watching as much YT. Full on no YT for 30 days though.   
\> Spotify - Cancelling Premium and deleting app for now. Will use RADIOOOO to listen to music when I want, to change the habit slowly. I love music. But I'm willing to detox majorly on it.   
\> Reddit - I will allow myself to interact when on a desktop and using it intentionally.   
\> Substances - Replace coffee with tea. Weed... ugh this is hard... I will work towards a detox.   
\> Thought Loops - I gotta be journaling more. Can't just sit and ruminate...   
\> GPT - Minimize this. Return to using google search. Already deleted icon off of my home screen.   


The science around this stuff is fascinating and I didn't think it would happen to me. I was like, yeah I'm not addicted. I don't have dopamine addiction issues.... YES I DO. YES I HAVE HAD THEM FOR A LONG TIME. And now its hitting a wall for me and how my cognition and present day focus abilities and concentration abilities work.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **CF Montreal vs. Toluca: A Leagues Cup Showdown of Shootout Heroes and Mexican Might**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of North American underdogs and Mexican maestros! CF Montreal, fresh off a penalty-kick *thriller* against Le√≥n, now faces Toluca‚Äîa Liga MX titan with the swagger of a team that‚Äôs won more trophies than a grandma at a craft fair. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a ref‚Äôs whistle and the humor of a stadium DJ who‚Äôs seen it all.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Favorite?

The numbers don‚Äôt lie (well, they might if they‚Äôre trying to trick us into buying overpriced nachos). Toluca is the clear favorite, with odds hovering around **-150 to -160** (implied probability: \~62-63%). Montreal? They‚Äôre the long shot at **+400 to +500** (19-23%), while the draw sits at **+375 to +420** (24-27%).

Translation: Bookmakers think Toluca is as reliable as a coffee machine in the morning‚Äîconsistent, dominant, and likely to leave Montreal feeling like they‚Äôve been kicked by a caffeinated mule. The spread (-1.0 goal for Toluca) suggests even a narrow win for the Mexican side would satisfy bettors, while the over/under of 3.0 goals hints at a high-scoring spectacle. Let‚Äôs hope someone brings a net to catch all those shots‚ÄîRed Bull Arena‚Äôs concession stands might need the revenue.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Comebacks

**CF Montreal**: They‚Äôre the sports equivalent of a ‚Äú50% off‚Äù sale‚Äîexciting in theory, but you‚Äôre not sure what you‚Äôre getting. Their 7-6 penalty-kick victory over Le√≥n was cinematic: down, then up, then *literally* kicking it into overtime. Prince Osei Owusu‚Äôs heroics saved the day, but Montreal‚Äôs MLS struggles (they‚Äôre *bottom of the Eastern Conference*) suggest they‚Äôre like a toaster that only pops half the time. Coach Wilfried Nancy is probably muttering, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got potential‚Ä¶ if potential had a heartb

# When the Words Disappeared

There was a time when an unbearable weight of depression landed on my shoulders.¬†¬†I‚Äôm not quite sure what triggered it, but it hit me like a ton of bricks.¬†¬†I couldn‚Äôt find joy in simple pleasures.¬†¬†My hobbies and interests quietly fell to the wayside.¬†¬†And all I could do was sit with my misery.

That heavy fog stayed with me for years.¬†¬†All I wanted was to be able to write again and get the ache out of my body and onto the page.¬†¬†But not a single word came.¬†¬†No journal entries.¬†¬†No poems.¬†¬†No scribbled thoughts.¬†¬†The part of me that had always found meaning through words had gone utterly silent.

It wasn‚Äôt that I had nothing to say.¬†¬†I had too much to say‚Äîbut the weight of everything I was carrying made it impossible to speak, let alone write.¬†¬†I began to wonder if I had lost myself entirely.

I‚Äôd spend entire days lying in bed with the curtains closed, sobbing underneath my comforter.¬†¬†By the end of the day, my eyelids were so swollen I could barely lift them.¬†¬†I just felt trapped in a stillness that felt endless.

I remember trying to pick up a pen.¬†¬†I‚Äôd just sit there, staring at a blank page, quietly begging the words to come.¬†¬†But my mind was too loud with intrusive thoughts, each one whispering the same cruel lie:

* That I was worthless.
* That I had nothing left to say.
* That even if I tried, it wouldn‚Äôt matter.

# Not Lazy‚ÄîJust Surviving

For the longest time, I thought I was lazy, unmotivated, and broken.¬†¬†That maybe I had wasted my potential.¬†¬†That maybe I just didn‚Äôt care enough to try.¬†¬†But the truth? I wasn‚Äôt any of those things.¬†¬†I was surviving.

Burnout, depression, and anxiety don‚Äôt always show up in the ways you expect. Sometimes they look like quiet withdrawal.¬†¬†It could be staying in bed all day and still feeling tired.¬†¬†It could be being surrounded by people and still feeling alone.¬†¬†

I remember one afternoon, a friend texted me:¬†*‚ÄúYou okay? I haven‚Äôt heard from you.‚Äù*¬†It was difficult. I wanted to respond, but the act of typing a few words felt like too much of an effort.¬†

# A Small Beginning

Eventually, I hit a point where I was just done.¬†¬†I was tired of feeling stuck.¬†¬†Tired of carrying so much pain.¬†¬†I didn‚Äôt know what healing would look like, but I knew I needed help.

So, I reached out.

* I found a therapist.
* I cried through every appointment.
* I started medication‚Äîone that didn‚Äôt numb me but steadied me.
* I told someone the truth about how I‚Äôd been feeling

Healing didn‚Äôt come in one big wave.¬†¬†It came in small, barely visible shifts:¬†¬†A morning walk with my dog.¬†¬†A good cup of coffee.¬†¬†The first smile I didn‚Äôt have to fake.

# Scribbles That Turned into Stories

One day, I picked up a pen again.¬†¬†No pressure.¬†¬†No expectations.¬†¬†Just intention. First, it was a sentence.¬†¬†Then a paragraph.¬†¬†Then an entire page.¬†¬†The words were messy.¬†¬†The thoughts were jumbled.¬†¬†But they were¬†mine.

That day, I tried something new: a freestyle writing session.¬†¬†No structure. No grammar checks. Just me, pouring everything onto the page.

One moment I was writing about anxiety.¬†¬†The next, fluffy unicorns dancing on rainbows.¬†¬†It made no sense‚Äîand that was the point.¬†¬†The words were flowing again.¬†¬†And that was the beginning of coming back to myself.

# Healing, One Word at a Time

Now, I try to journal regularly.¬†¬†I write blog posts each week.¬†¬†I write about food, feelings, identity, and the quiet in-between spaces.

Some days, the words still get stuck.¬†¬†Some days, I go quiet again.¬†¬†But I no longer see that as failure.¬†¬†I‚Äôve learned to trust my rhythms.¬†¬†Some seasons are for expression.¬†¬†Others are for stillness and restoration.

Lately, I‚Äôve started using gentle writing prompts when I feel blocked.¬†¬†They‚Äôve become little doorways back to my creativity.

1meha9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1meha9g/ill_be_seeing_you/,I‚Äôll Be Seeing You,"The sun began to fade behind the lonely church, casting mournful shadows across the lawn. 

All the folks who had held us close through every season of our lives‚Äîdrifting solemnly down the chapel stairs. Soft words echoing about the thinning crowd. She could hear their Sunday shoes whispering grief across the pavement. 

Inside, the pews sat abandoned‚Äîdusted with trash and forgotten programs. There, Gina sat alone. 

Her shoulders curled slightly inward, from both the heaviness of age and indescribable despair, like something folding in on itself‚Äî quiet and defeated.

She thought herself too *old* for heartache. 

Oh, how life had proved her wrong. She had spent nearly *fifty* years with the love of her life, Gunther Morrison. Decades of soft laughter, quiet mornings and endless life-lessons were stitched into her memory. Yet none of it had prepared her for *this*. 

She placed a trembling hand on the casket. 

To lose someone after *forever*‚Äîshe shut her eyes, as if scared of the thought. A woman startled her, having rested her hand near Gina‚Äôs own. 

‚ÄúGunther was *so* good to everybody‚Äî‚Äù 

She spoke. Gina looked up at her. ‚ÄúBut Lord knows, he was *good* to you.‚Äù The woman patted the casket before walking off. Gina managed a tender smile. Gunther was indeed, a *good* man.

She decidedly took the long way home.

The drive felt like crossing dimensions. Memories danced around her. Her weathered eyes watched as the rays bent through the windows like stained glass. She passed Franklin Square‚Äîthe park Gunther had knelt before her, nervous and youthfully unsure and *proposed*. Then, Hilltop Drive. Where they shared their first kiss. 

He was fire and thunder. Wore his love like armor. But most of all‚Äîhe was *hers*.

When she arrived‚ÄîThe house they built together rose before her. It was here they raised children. Grew *old*. Conquered all their fears. She walked to the door slowly. Her sway, frayed by time. 

She shakily turned the knob.

She made her way down the hall when suddenly a familiar scent inticed her‚Äîwarm, rich, like coffee and cologne. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Gunther?‚Äù Gina whispered.

The scent tugged at her, gentle and insistent. She followed it to the foyer, Gunther‚Äôs favorite room, where they‚Äôd once hummed old jazz melodies and told stories inspired by fading photographs.

Her withered eyes scanned the room. No one.  

‚ÄúOh, Gunther. What am I doing?‚Äù Her heart and memory, traitors now‚Äî played cruel, quiet tricks. 

She turned to leave

*Crash* 

The sound jolted her. 

She turned, breath catching, as a picture frame lay face down on the floor, its glass fractured like ice. 

It was their wedding photo. Beneath the shards, a folded paper peeked out‚Äîa name barely visible at the top. She knelt slowly and pulled it free. 

‚ÄúOh, *Gunther*‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be seeing you.‚Äù

Her eyes softened as she traced the edges. A broken sound escaped her throat before a tune took hold. Their *favorite* song. 

And across the top of the program, dated for today:  **In Loving Memory: Gina Morrison.**

My (autistic 20f) Fianc√© , Lets call him Seth (22m) have been together for a while, my sister Vicky (autistic 28f) and Seth became friends while we first started dating. Vicky has offered Seth multiple times to come over while I‚Äôm at work, she lives close to there and we are trying to save gas, whatever, right? 

But yesterday everything went to shit while I was at work. Vicky doesn‚Äôt have a car or license (she can walk to where she needs as she lives right outside of town) and she offered Seth to get some coffees. When they got back Seth said he would be in in a moment and she asked why, Seth told her he was gonna take a hit off of his pen (THC), as he has anxiety and uses it to medicate, which driving makes him nervous in the city as there is construction) and Vicky starts freaking out, but does drop it (for the time being as she‚Äôs against pot) Seth comes in to the apartment and Vicky asks if he is okay if she naps, Seth says it‚Äôs fine and goes to the couch to nap too. 

Seth then gets woken up by her saying they need to talk. Vicky talked to some friends online and apparently they said it was rude for him to use pot, even if it was outside of her apartment and in his own car (no keys in ignition, as he refuses to drive stoned) and didn‚Äôt wanna intrude on her as he knows she doesn‚Äôt like the smell. My phone starts blowing up at work, mind you I am in the middle of a 6 hour shift with no breaks, no lunch. I tell her to drop it until I get out of work. (My fianc√© had left at this point to go to his car to respect her wishes, but was upset and confused.) 

Vicky still insisted on blowing my phone up to the point I‚Äôm like ‚Äòso what, he did it respectfully and not around you, and it‚Äôs legal here‚Äô and she is freaking the hell out, saying I‚Äôm a bad sister for not sticking up for her. I am inconsiderate and she is gonna get our dad involved (heavy hippie) saying I don‚Äôt respect her. 
Our dad has to be explained what happened and he sides with me and my guy. 

Vicky is pissed and hangs up on him, going to his mom to tell her what happened (our gram raised her) and then dad gets bitched out.
I hear this when I get out of work, (Seth filled me in) and go to check my messages, only to see Vicky‚Äôs friends are now spamming me and calling me rude names and such. I blocked them all but my sisters number cause she was my best friend before this.

At the end of each month I sweep any surplus from checking to savings.

This week, due to a vet emergency with my cat (he's fine, btw), I went over this week's budget by $1291.    Well, yes, this is what we have an eFund for, but ....

But, I just finished my monthly total out. Because of the fact that I have been so mindful with my spending this month and the luck of not needing $400 of the $500 set aside for possible medical bills, I will not need to tap my eFund.  In fact, I will have $22.90 to sweep to savings.

Now, it doesn't matter what method you use to structure your cashflow -- envelope, zero based, reverse budget, 50/30/20, Kakeibo, etc. -- **the point is my particular emergency shows why it's vital to have some means, some plan for how your money gets spent, and to know where it is going.**

A money plan enables you to take a whalloping in stride and make a plan to recover from it, either by tapping your savings, tightening up for the rest of the month (if the set back happened early on), or realizing it's not a thing because you spent so mindfully all month (and had some luck) that it won't put you over.

**A money plan is not about denying yourself anything, it's ultimately about freedom from money anxiety. And you deserve freedom!**

But the other day, I ended up drinking it at a cafe because their self-serve pot of regular coffee was empty. Decaf was the only option, so I figured, why not.

To my surprise, it tasted just as good as regular coffee. I‚Äôd always had this weird impression that decaf tasted bad. I had no idea it could actually be this good.

Out of curiosity, I looked up what decaf actually is. Turns out, it‚Äôs not completely caffeine-free: about 97% of the caffeine is removed, but it still contains a small amount.

Coffee is known to have some health benefits, like being a major source of antioxidants and potentially reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Interestingly, decaf coffee still offers many of the same benefits, though it contains slightly fewer antioxidants, about 15% less than regular coffee.

Of course, caffeine has its own benefits. It‚Äôs great when you‚Äôre tired, need to focus, or want to feel more alert.

But I don‚Äôt drink coffee for those reasons. I drink it purely for the flavor, so I might actually switch to decaf in the evenings, just to enjoy it at night without worrying about it messing up my sleep.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Leagues Cup 2025: Santos Laguna vs. Colorado Rapids ‚Äì A Matchup of Math and Mayhem**

The Leagues Cup has descended into a chaotic ballet of cross-border soccer, and tonight‚Äôs clash between **Santos Laguna** (Mexico) and **Colorado Rapids** (USA) is a prime example of why bookmakers charge by the decimal point. Let‚Äôs dissect this like a spreadsheet on Red Bull.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are screaming ‚Äú**Colorado Rapids**‚Äù louder than a fan in the 89th minute of a 1-1 tie. Their implied probabilities? A tidy **64.9%** (based on decimal odds of \~1.53), while Santos Laguna‚Äôs chances hover around **18-22%**. The draw? A paltry **20-23%**, which is about as likely as a Mexican wave in a tornado.

The spread (-1.0 for Colorado) suggests the Rapids should win by two, while totals hover around **3.5 goals**. That‚Äôs the soccer equivalent of a ‚Äúmoderate apocalypse‚Äù ‚Äî enough goals to keep the highlights reel juicy but not so many that the referees need IV drips.

### Digesting the News: Fictional Fodder

Since the provided data lacks real-world injuries or drama, let‚Äôs invent some for comedic effect:

* **Colorado Rapids**: Star midfielder **Drew Moor** is ‚Äúrecovering from a minor case of overachieving last match,‚Äù per team sources. Translation: He‚Äôs fine, but his coffee addiction is concerning.
* **Santos Laguna**: Top scorer **Johan V√°squez** is ‚Äúon a strict diet of tacos and confidence,‚Äù according to his agent. Translation: He‚Äôs eith

I‚Äôm 25f and my coworker is 36f. We‚Äôve worked together for years and have always been close, but lately things feel different. I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs regularly allowed in her office.  Or at least the only person 'not actually annoying'

She calls me a nickname I hate and always makes a point I say only she can call me it

 We‚Äôll sit in there for hours talking about everything and nothing. We lock eyes in the hallway and have this daily routine where one of us goes, ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how are you‚Ä¶‚Äù and the other mimics the tone exactly. It‚Äôs small, but it‚Äôs like a ritual now.

We also have what honestly feels like daily little lover‚Äôs tiffs like teasing, bantering, challenging each other. It‚Äôs like a dance, every morning, every day. Fake arguments. It‚Äôs constant and kind of intense in a way I‚Äôve never had with a friend.

She checks in on me outside of work. During a recent crisis, she called me not her boyfriend  because she said she needed me to help her calm down and process what had happened. That really stuck with me.

Then the other day, I brought myself a hot coffee and set it on my desk. She walked in, smiled, and just took it, saying ‚ÄúThanks, it‚Äôs mine now‚Äù while laughing and walking off. I told her I was mad and said I‚Äôd kill anyone else for that, and she responded, ‚ÄúBut not me‚Ä¶ because you like me..... As a colleague.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúBarely tolerate you.‚Äù A few hours later, I stole her coffee in return and she yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling the police!"" Tutting and pointing her finger batting me away

She says she‚Äôs not gay, but this doesn‚Äôt feel like a regular friendship. I don‚Äôt have this kind of emotional push-pull with anyone else. I don‚Äôt want to misread things or make it awkward, but I also don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs just messing with me or if something more is happening here. ",1,1754005032.0,dating_advice,3,0.6,False

The summer had been unusual. A lot of cool mornings with only one heatwave, which had caused the town‚Äôs usually good tourism to hit a low and most of the vendors had packed up well before the official end of summer. A chunk of the residents had vacated to hotter areas outside of town. The only people happy with the weather was a group of picnickers who had chosen a particular spot just off the riverbank where a thick trail of weeds led to barren ground. The town was otherwise mostly a dirtpile geographically. One family was visiting for the first time with their teenage son and his friend, who‚Äôd heard about the good tourism. They‚Äôd arrived just after the vendors left and were disappointed, but tried asking around for other venues. The few remaining kiosks said all big events were at least one hour away. The parents turned to their son and his friend, who were zoned out.

‚ÄúHey!! What do you guys wanna do?‚Äù The son blinked, coming back into his body.

‚ÄúMATT!! Hello..?? Dillon?! I‚Äôm talking to you!‚Äù His friend yawned, nudging Matt.

‚ÄúBro, they‚Äôre asking something.‚Äù Matt straightened up, alert.

‚ÄúThe open venues are at least another hour, what do you wanna do?‚Äù He gave a long shrug.

‚Äú...I don‚Äôt know. This was Dillon‚Äôs idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you have your phone?‚Äù The dad asked. His friend took it out and with some reception trouble, found comparison information between locations.

‚ÄúMost hotels are full and the available ones are more than one hour. Not too many here, either.‚Äù The kiosk host spoke up.

‚ÄúThere IS a decent one twenty minutes away, although that route‚Äôs going through heavy construction. You still have over one hour of daylight to decide.‚Äù They all looked at each other.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather stay local.‚Äù Matt looked at his mom quizzically.

‚ÄúBut you hate construction.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd still rather deal with that than risk arriving late for a hotel that‚Äôs probably full.‚Äù He looked between his friend and dad.

‚ÄúYou guys backing her or what?‚Äù His dad gave a look.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not arguing with her at this hour. I‚Äôll go with the construction. It‚Äôs only 5 o‚Äô clock.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds aight.‚Äù The boys said in unison. They thanked the host and headed back to the car, the sun hitting their sides.

‚ÄúSo, like, if this place is haunted, should we ask for a discount?‚Äù Matt asked casually. His dad rolled his eyes at him.

‚ÄúIf it is, I‚Äôll ask the ghost or ghosts to get you first!‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt mind if it‚Äôs a chick.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôll get one each, haha!‚Äù Dillon and Matt fist-bumped.

The drive ended up taking almost one hour with the construction causing a lot of dust, and his mom was trying to keep her cool when they finally parked. It was nearly 7 o‚Äô clock and the still air had been replaced by slapping winds. The boys jumped out the moment the engine was off for a much-needed stretch. Dillon at a lanky 5‚Äô5‚Äù always looked comical doing so next to Matt‚Äôs lanky 5‚Äô9‚Äù. They surveyed the front of the hotel and were glad the kiosk guy hadn‚Äôt lied. Very average-looking but modern. Everyone grabbed their things and headed in. His mom was polite through the check-in process but when they got to their separate room she started venting.

	‚Äú...dear GOD that was insane!!!!....gAAaAAAahhh!!!!!!...I hate, hate, HATE IT!!! Stupid stupid, stupid!!! Roads suck, I hate people. Fffffffaaaaaaaaaahhh‚Ä¶..!!!!!!‚Äù She let out a long sigh. The dad looked at her with love as he changed.

	‚ÄúBetter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI hate you, too.‚Äù He laughed and got into bed.

‚ÄúI expect you to get some good sleep after all of that, honey.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting a good SOMETHING no matter what!‚Äù He looked at her flatly.

‚ÄúNOT the time or place.‚Äù She raised her brow at him.

‚ÄúThat was rhetorical.‚Äù He mouthed ‚ÄúOooh.‚Äù

‚ÄúANYWAY, those two had better be ready to head off by check-out. Did you text them a reminder?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, and Matt responded so politely. As always.‚Äù she rolled her eyes while changing as well.

‚ÄúJust as long as they know the time. And speaking of, I‚Äôm really tired and you need to scootch over more.‚Äù He obeyed and she got under the covers, turning the lights off.



In their own room, Matt and Dillon were barely making an effort to get into bed, they were too hyped over finding out if the hotel was haunted. Dillon‚Äôs phone was rapidly clicking as he went through several sites, laying on the bed.

	‚Äú...haunted hotels‚Ä¶.Wolfeboro, New Hampshire‚Ä¶.[hauntmash.com](http://hauntmash.com), [hotelhaunt.com](http://hotelhaunt.com), New Hampshire in October‚Ä¶blah blah blah‚Ä¶this sucks, bro.‚Äù Matt was standing at the window and beckoned.

‚ÄúGet over here!‚Äù He whispered urgently. His friend was perplexed but curious and walked over.

‚ÄúWhatchu got?‚Äù Matt pointed at the ground, to a tree close to the building.

‚ÄúCheck it out!‚Äù He still whispered. Dillon leaned against the window and peered down. Someone was at the tree, in dark clothing, wearing what looked like a long shawl flapping in the wind. They were making abnormal movements and moving things around at the base of the trunk.¬†

‚ÄúToo bad we‚Äôre on the second floor, we could have a better look.‚Äù Dillon continued whispering. The person placed their hand on the tree a few times, then hurried off.

‚ÄúDUDE‚Äì!‚Äù They both quietly speed-walked out of the room, down the hallway, to the elevator. Reaching the first floor, they politely exited the front and carefully found their way to the back where the tree was, despite the strong wind. Their medium-length hair looked wild as it whipped around. Dillon turned his phone‚Äôs light on and scanned the area. Both boys were confused and disappointed. There was nothing there. They looked around the whole tree, felt the trunk and grass. Nothing.

‚ÄúThe fuck‚Ä¶? Maaan, that‚Äôs messed up, bro.‚Äù Matt kicked the trunk.

‚ÄúI guess even out here there are tweakers.‚Äù Dillon saw a big piece of loose leaf bark hanging on for dear life in the wind at the very bottom and knelt down to free it.¬†

‚ÄúOw!‚Äù The bark was somehow sharp and had given his finger a nice papercut. He stood up, sucking on it and muttering in frustration.¬†

‚ÄúMother Nature strikes back!‚Äù Matt teased.

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù His friend retorted. Turning away from the tree, a transparent piece of brown glass with blood on it fell on another piece of transparent glass, making a slight tinker.¬†



They hurried back and asked the front desk for band-aids. Quietly passing his parents‚Äô room, they stopped and listened. All was silent. They returned to their room. Checking the time, Matt was startled.

	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 2am, dawg!! Wasn‚Äôt it only barely 9 o‚Äô clock when we went out there??‚Äù Dillon gave a quizzical look and checked his own phone.

	‚ÄúMaybe our phones had an update and this is a brief glitch.‚Äù Matt frowned and pointed to the hotel clock.

	‚ÄúThat one says the same time. Is this place on an indian burial ground?‚Äù Dillon let out a big, tired sigh.

	‚ÄúBro, I don‚Äôt care. I just want to sleep. We gotta be up early but I still wanna crash for a bit.‚Äù Matt closed his mouth in a resigned gesture and got into the shower. Several minutes later he flopped onto the provided chair with wet hair, in his pajamas and set an alarm. He raised his brows at Dillon.

	‚ÄúDude, take a shower. I‚Äôm not sleeping next to swamp ass.‚Äù His friend grunted and went to the bathroom. Matt heard the showerhead turn on and got under the covers. He reached over to the lamp, thought he heard a strange squeal from outside and switched the light off. He was out almost immediately so didn‚Äôt hear Dillon get into the bed or whimper when his finger suddenly throbbed but just as quickly the feeling stopped.



The wind had gone gentle and the tree was slightly swaying. Two figures approached it and began a set of unusual movements. After a bit of time they left, the tree now completely still.



The phone alarm went off what seemed like 5 minutes later, the sun just coming up. Both boys groaned but knew better than to hit the snooze. Rubbing their eyes, they literally rolled out of bed, making thunks on the floor. ‚ÄúI hate 6am‚Äù Matt complained as he yawned loudly, checking his phone for a text from his parents but nothing.¬†

	‚ÄúI need to see if they‚Äôre up,‚Äù he said, slowly getting off the floor. Heading out to the hallway, he knocked on their door. ‚ÄúMeet you downstairs in 15!‚Äù His dad yelled. ‚ÄúOkay!‚Äù Matt confirmed. Rubbing his light brown bed hair, he went back inside to dress. Dillon had taken his band-aid off and was inspecting his finger, looking concerned. His friend raised his brows.

	‚ÄúDid it grow fungus?‚Äù

	‚Äú...I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on‚Ä¶the scar is a weird pattern‚Ä¶like a smile?‚Äù Matt looked and it did resemble a faint bloody smile.

‚Äú...I guess as long as it‚Äôs not turning gangrenous or blue or whatever infected colors?‚Äù Dillon pursed his lips.

‚ÄúI suppose it‚Äôs just a unique cut.‚Äù He put his hand down. ‚ÄúAre your parents up?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre meeting us downstairs in 15 minutes.‚Äù He got up.

‚ÄúGive me a minute in the bathroom.‚Äù He hurried around the corner. Matt checked his phone for big events in Wakefield while packing his bag‚Ä¶.stage plays‚Ä¶a carnival‚Ä¶.museum‚Ä¶‚Äùthere‚Äôs some good stuff where we‚Äôre going!‚Äù ‚ÄúGood deal, man.‚Äù Dillon came out, changed and his dark brown hair as combed as it could get. ‚ÄúYour turn.‚Äù Matt closed the door firmly. His friend kept checking his finger while packing his own bag, unable to get his mind off the scar. He stood by the front door, ready to head out. He could hear Matt‚Äôs parents making conversation. The bathroom door opened and they headed down the hall to the elevator, calling it up.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt it nice when the kids are first?‚Äù Dillon quipped.¬†

‚ÄúThey just care that we‚Äôre out on time.‚Äù Entering the elevator, they were welcomed by a not half-bad continental breakfast downstairs. The parents exited the elevator with their belongings as the boys were munching on cinnamon rolls and pocketing oranges.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs some good stuff to check out in Wakefield.‚Äù Matt told them through a mouthful. They gave approving nods.

‚ÄúThanks for checking, my guy!‚Äù His dad slapped his shoulder and grabbed an apple, his mom was making coffee. Dillon belched, making them give gross looks.

‚ÄúKAY, I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù Matt‚Äôs mom sipped her coffee.

‚ÄúGo wait by the car.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

The remaining three finished their breakfast and packed into the car. Matt gave the directions, adding ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reports of construction and at this hour there should be no traffic.‚Äù

	‚ÄúThank goodness. How‚Äôd you two sleep?‚Äù The boys rolled their eyes.

	‚ÄúNot enough! How was yours?‚Äù

	‚Äú...your dad kept farting all night‚Ä¶‚Äù she answered in irritation. His dad cracked up.

	‚ÄúHEY, I‚Äôm saving the earth through natural gas!‚Äù As if on cue, both boys farted.

	‚ÄúSorry!!‚Äù They chorused. His mom rolled her eyes and muttered to herself. The drive was uneventful, going through scrubland, fields and dotted woods until halfway when a sudden windstorm picked up. A digital freeway sign read, ‚ÄúSEVERE WIND/ROAD DEBRIS/FREEWAY CLOSED.‚Äù The boys and dad braced for impact. His mom gripped the steering wheel with rage.

	‚Äú.....FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!!!!‚Äù His dad decided to take over and told her to pull over at the next turn-out, which was 1 mile.

	‚ÄúHONEY. I‚ÄôM. FINE.‚Äù She said through clenched teeth. He gave her a look.

	‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt pull over, I‚Äôll make you listen to my favorite CD.‚Äù She glowered.

	‚Äú....fiiine‚Ä¶.‚Äù

The turn-out approached and she not-so-gently brought the car to a stop. He got out and patiently stayed on his side. He watched her do a breathing exercise for a minute and then slowly got out. He walked around, held her and then got into the driver‚Äôs side. Pulling back onto the road, he took them back towards Wolfeboro. Matt‚Äôs mom was staring out the window, chin in palm, legs crossed. No one said anything until they approached the town entrance.¬†

	‚ÄúWe could explore that riverbank on the other side.‚Äù Matt suggested.

‚ÄúYou all do what you want,‚Äù said his very deflated mother.

‚ÄúWe could try another route to Wakefield or another city?‚Äù Dillon chimed in.¬†

‚ÄúWe have all day. Let‚Äôs look around and then maybe try another city.‚Äù His dad decided. He drove through the town and a sign pointing to ‚ÄúRiverbank‚Äù came into view. It connected them to a back road for 2 miles and then opened into a parking lot surrounded by thick patches of weeds. His dad got out and went to the passenger side, opening the door.¬†

‚ÄúCome on, honey.‚Äù He extended his hand as she looked at him and took it, slightly reluctantly. She unbuckled herself and he pulled her out, giving a quick kiss.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have fun today regardless.‚Äù She sighed and nodded.

They all went through the lot and onto the scrubby bank, trying to avoid all the weeds. It didn‚Äôt take long to reach the lake. For the heatwave they were in, the lake edge was surprisingly really cool with a refreshing breeze going across. They stood enjoying the view of the expansive sparkling view, specks of another town in the far distance. Matt started walking along the edge, then Dillon, then the parents. He ended up leading them, zigzagging around bunches of weeds. They approached a tall thicket and he had to force his way through.

	‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really thick through here, guys! Watch yourselves!‚Äù He called back. He caught a glimpse of Dillon elbowing and pushing the weeds away. Matt got to the end and the area opened up in a wide circle, the weeds thinned out much more in places. He looked around at the ground, noticing it was distinctly circular. HIs parents made their way to him.

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Dillon? Did he go back? Wasn‚Äôt he behind you, sweetie?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúW-huh..?‚Äù Matt was immediately concerned and panned the area.

‚ÄúDillooooon!!!! Where are you??!‚Äù He expected an answer but nothing. He cupped his hands to his mouth and yelled louder.¬†

‚ÄúDIIIILLOOOOONNN!!!!!! GET THE FUCK OUT HERE, BRO!!!!‚Äù They all started back the way they came, scouring the weeds in case he‚Äôd somehow fallen. Arriving at the other end of the thicket, the three of them were panicked.¬†

‚ÄúDoes this town even have police?? Where do we go??!‚Äù His mom frantically wondered. His dad ran a mildly trembling hand through his hair.

‚ÄúWe need to keep our wits. I imagine he‚Äôs not the first person to go missing around here. Let‚Äôs find SOMEONE, okay?‚Äù They went back to the car and Matt searched for police stations, the closest one thirty minutes out. His dad practically threw the car in that direction. In what seemed like fifteen minutes later, they pulled up to the station and nearly ran inside. The officer at the window took one look and knew it was a missing person.

‚ÄúMy friend‚Äôs gone!!!‚Äù ‚ÄúHis friend‚Äôs been kidnapped, he disappeared!‚Äù They all yelled in panic at once. The officer leaned in, told them to take slow deep breaths and then to give details one at a time. Matt exhaled slowly and went first.

‚ÄúWe were at the riverbank in Wolfboro, going through a huge bunch of weeds, my friend Dillon was behind me, then my parents. I got into a clearing first, then my parents. Dillon vanished. The officer nodded ‚Äúokay.‚Äù

‚ÄúHis dad and I came through all the weeds and into the clearing and saw him but not Dillon. We have no idea what happened.‚Äù The officer leaned back and yelled to one of his staff, ‚ÄúSerche(Sehr-sh)! Another missing persons, Wolfboro.‚Äù The family looked incredulous.

‚ÄúWait, what???‚Äù The officer leaned forward again.

	‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had more than a few incidents regarding the lake area in that town involving some very old history related to a cult. A family from the 1900‚Äôs. Last name of ‚ÄòHappy.‚Äô Officer Serche specifically handles cases from there.‚Äù He handed her a clipboard with a form. ‚ÄúFill this out.‚Äù Matt‚Äôs mom took the form on a clipboard with a ‚Äúwhat the fuck‚Äù look, slowly turned around and went to one of the lounge chairs, slowly sank into it. His dad looked about to break down.

	‚ÄúMatt‚Ä¶I‚Äôm so sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù he sniffed with a wavering voice. He put his face in his hands and shook. Matt was very still and red-eyed. His mom began writing out the information and after a few minutes, very robotically, got up and took the form back to the window. Officer Serche appeared and took it from her.

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, I‚Äôm very sorry this happened. I‚Äôll be leading this case.‚Äù He looked at the paper.¬†

‚ÄúYou live three hours away?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, I haven‚Äôt even thought about-‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNot to interrupt, ma‚Äôam, but I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù He went around a corridor to a backroom for several minutes. He came back with a handful of cards and gave them to her.

‚ÄúThese	are hotel, gas and store vouchers. I‚Äôm sure you and your family will want to stay during the search.‚Äù She blinked several times.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúTalk it over. In the meantime I‚Äôll be preparing this case and contact you early next week. Please try to take care.‚Äù She turned around again and headed for the door. The family got up and followed.



That was Saturday. Late on Tuesday they indeed got a call from Officer Serche that they were setting up perimeters. The family had decided it was best to stay nearby for anything immediate and asked if they were allowed to help with the search.

	‚ÄúAbsolutely. You can come tomorrow. See you then.‚Äù They hung up and there was a tangible air of morbid uncertainty between Matt and his parents. They were in the same hotel from before with the same tree but Matt no longer cared. He just wanted his friend back.¬†



The following morning they were already at the perimeter, coordinating with the police where to go. He went with his dad, his mom with some search and rescue officers. All day they scoured and into the evening. Nothing. This process repeated many times and into the nearby towns until the search was officially called off. The family didn‚Äôt know what to do.



One year later Matt was seventeen with his own car and had convinced his parents to let him make the three hour drive alone to Wolfboro in private memoriam. He arrived at that same parking lot with all the weeds. Same strong wind and same as the first time, no one else was there. He sniffed, took a breath, and got out of the car. He took a steady pace across to the scrubby dirt and went down to the lake edge. He stopped a minute, hair being whipped around. Turned and like de ja vu, went that zig-zag path again and before he knew it, approached the thicket. He stood like a statue, cried a moment, took a deep breath, exhaled, and went in. These weeds were as thick and intrusive as the first time and he fought through. As he slowly went, he thought he could see glimpses of things or figures as the wind blew the weeds. Not knowing what to think, he kept pushing through until he got into the clearing and was hit with a terrible vibe. Several feet ahead were many people sitting in a circle with picnic supplies, but no one was moving. The group all turned their heads to Matt, abnormal smiles carved into their faces, their mouths bleeding. His friend was among them, staring as Matt stood there, petrified, small weeds tickling his legs in the wind.

‚Äú...D‚ÄìD‚Ä¶.deeh‚Ä¶hillon..?‚Äù His mouth barely worked out the whisper. Dillon just stared at him, his smile like a big white spot on a blackboard. The group started inviting him over, gesturing with their arms. Matt suddenly remembered his body and ran for his life, not caring which way he went.

  
  


Another year passed and the entire town was deserted now, unless you included some birds. A vicious windstorm had approached and was trying to knock hell over itself. Down by the riverbank, among the thicker weeds, something heavily buried got loosened. A very old sign got knocked into the air and twirled around into the middle of the picnic spot:



‚ÄúHAPPY RESIDENCE. ALL ARE WELCOME.‚Äù¬†

(Like I do, but I totally don‚Äôt at the same time.) The only times I‚Äôve ever come close have been with eating out.

My TDEE is ~2100 and I am going to be shooting for ~1950 while I focus on recomp through at least the end of the year. Adding another day of strength training and really trying to shave off a few more % of fat while I build some muscle to fill some of this loose skin. 

I do track most of the time and don‚Äôt mind it. I am on 10mg weekly and planning to stay there.

I really don‚Äôt see myself going down in dose or spacing out, based on how I feel towards the end of the week. If anything I can see that I might need to eventually go up while in maintenance.

üëâ So what I‚Äôm most curious about is what you added to or changed about your eating to get those extra calories. 

Real sugar coffee creamer? A larger portion of salmon? More cheese and avocado? 2T of PB instead of 1? A more fun dessert? 

Before Zep I sucked at being able to restrict, but I‚Äôm having trouble feeling permission to include more caloric things on the regular after a lifetime of telling myself I should avoid or limit them.

1megxyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/casualdating/comments/1megxyr/grindr_review_according_to_reddit_users_in_2025/,Grindr Review According To Reddit Users in 2025?,"I decided to give Grindr another shot last week after deleting it a few years ago. I‚Äôm in a new city now and figured maybe it would be different, or at least useful to meet a few people casually. The app's layout feels a bit cleaner now, but it‚Äôs still very much the same old Grindr experience, lots of blank profiles, people who don‚Äôt reply after messaging first, and way too many spam bots slipping through filters.

One specific thing that stood out this time though was the weird amount of ‚ÄúNFT bros‚Äù and crypto flexers popping up in my area. Like I had three different guys open with some version of ‚Äúyou into Web3?‚Äù and honestly I was not expecting that at all. I also noticed that messages vanish randomly if someone blocks you after chatting, which still sucks if you were mid-convo or planning to meet up.

To be fair, I did meet one guy who actually wanted to grab coffee and talk like a normal person, but that felt like the exception rather than the rule. Most people are either super blunt or just there to scroll without ever meeting. Curious what your experience has been like lately, have things gotten better in your city or is it still the same chaotic energy?",1,1754004581.0,casualdating,0,1.0,False
1megxxz,https://i.redd.it/vivj2qb5oagf1.jpeg,Allergic reaction on eyelids after surgery?,"My surgery(laparoscopic, kept only ovaries) was Monday, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone knows what they put on your eyelids during surgery that I could have been allergic to?(can I tell them not to use it in the future?) I kept trying to tell the nurse in recovery that my eyelids were itchy, but she just kept assuming I was talking about my eyes being dry and I was too out of it to be more clear. This is what they looked like when I got home. I also have a mild reaction where the heart monitor sticker was under my boob. I am putting aquaphor on my eyelids, and that seems to be helping them heal up. 

Also strangely enough I went under with an eczema flareup on my palms and woke up with no trace of it. 

Other than that recovery is going amazing. No surgery gas pains at all, just intestinal gas. MiraLAX and Colace weren‚Äôt doing enough to get things moving for me, but coffee did the trick. Not having any difficulty moving around and I‚Äôm a strange chicken who finds anesthesia very restful, so I haven‚Äôt been tired much. ",2,1754004579.0,hysterectomy,20,0.67,False
1megxpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1megxpo/anyone_in_laser_tech_field/,Anyone in laser tech field?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a 33F, currently living in Falls Church and going through a major life transition. I recently got divorced and used to co-own a restaurant with my ex-husband. Now, I‚Äôm preparing for a fresh start and looking into a new career path that truly interests me.

Lately, I‚Äôve become really drawn to the field of cosmetic laser treatments‚Äîespecially things like skin tightening, laser hair removal, and laser tattoo removal. The problem is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know anyone in this field..:( so I‚Äôve been feeling a bit lost about how to even begin.

I‚Äôd love to hear anything from anyone working in this industry.

If there‚Äôs anyone in the area who‚Äôs working as a laser tech and wouldn‚Äôt mind meeting for coffee or brunch, I‚Äôd absolutely love that. I don‚Äôt have any friends here yet. Thanks so much for reading and for any advice or insight you can offer. I really appreciate it! üíõ",1,1754004562.0,nova,0,0.56,False

1megsi5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1megsi5,The lid to this jar doesn't seal tight.,"I love drinking instant coffee and the glass containers are awesome to reuse as storage containers. I have several that I keep my sewing, arts and crafts, office supplies, nails, screws,  dry foods and so much more.

I have even gave away some to friends when I showed them how I reuse them. Now I'm told to drink more coffee LOL.

But the lid doesn't seal very well without the paper sealer. So storing any liquids is a big no.

I have stopped buying milk it's such a big waste for me. I live by myself and a half gallon of milk goes bad before I can use it all. I don't drink milk I only cook with it. So I just waste milk and use more plastic. 

I've been using powder milk when I need milk for a receipe. It's been working out very well. The milk keeps better when stored in a glass container. I have a small glass canning jar that I've been using but I really want to make the coffee jar work somehow.  

But I can't figure out how to make the lid seal tighter on the jar without using the paper seal. Without the paper seal, the jar leaks. 

Any suggestions?

‚òï[Tip Jar](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I‚Äôve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ‚ù£Ô∏è (P.S. if you‚Äôre having trouble getting to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",23,1754004003.0,TwinCities,1,0.9,False
1megpog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1megpog/why_i_stopped_buying_ashwagandha_and_started/,Why I stopped buying ashwagandha and started growing it myself,"Ashwagandha has been a part of my stack on and off for a few years. Mostly for stress, sleep, and general recovery. Like a lot of people here, I‚Äôm not expecting miracles but I always felt it helped me stay a little more level, especially during higher training volume or getting stressed at work.

But I started getting a bit more skeptical about the stuff I was taking regularly. You read enough studies and supplement reviews, and you start realizing how little consistency there can be between products. Extract ratios, fillers, standardization, quality control- even with decent brands, it‚Äôs hard to know exactly what you‚Äôre getting.

Not too knowledgeable about plants but I managed to grow some this year-

# What that looked like:

* I used Withania somnifera seeds (the actual species used in traditional and clinical settings). (Don't think I can discuss sources)
* Planted in early summer, in a big pot with sandy, well-draining soil.
* Got some info from plant care apps, the plant wants full sun and minimal water once it‚Äôs established, no fertilizers, no sprays, takes around 5‚Äì6 months to become ready for extract. Most recent one was with [Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=r_bh), did an ID to double check I had the correct plant, health scan to make sure it wasn't dying. I would deffo make sure you check in plant reddits or this one to make sure its legit as a final check.

By late autumn, the plant started yellowing and dying back- which is when you‚Äôre supposed to harvest. I pulled the root, cleaned it, chopped it into small pieces, and air-dried it over 10‚Äì14 days. Once dry, I ground it into powder with a basic coffee grinder and stored it in a glass jar. my haul yielded about 2 months worth of doses at 1g a day so if I want to do this long term Ill have to scale up my method.

# Why I prefer it now:

* I know exactly what‚Äôs in it. No maltodextrin, no capsules, no ‚Äúsensoril blend‚Äù fluff. Just root.
* It‚Äôs surprisingly effective, even in small doses. I started with around 1mg in warm water before bed- tastes earthy but not awful.
* I noticed better sleep, less anxiety at night, and a more calm baseline during the day. Nothing crazy, just steady.
* There‚Äôs something grounding about using something you actually grew yourself. It becomes part of your system on another level. Hard to explain, but you feel more connected to your inputs.

# Is it more potent?

No idea. I didn‚Äôt lab test anything. But subjectively, it feels about the same as the better-quality capsules I used to take- maybe even a bit stronger. Could just be freshness or placebo. Doesn‚Äôt really matter to me. Let me know if you want me to do some testing and compare it to a brand (I think Janoshik does some?)

# Final thoughts

Obviously this won‚Äôt be for everyone. You need time, space, and patience. But if you're already into DIY, gardening, or just being more intentional about what you put in your body, it‚Äôs worth trying. It‚Äôs not just about saving money or being ‚Äúnatural‚Äù it‚Äôs about taking control of your inputs and closing the loop. Lost trust in a lot of these brands.

Would love to hear if anyone else here is growing their own herbs or adaptogens or if you‚Äôve experimented with preparing your own nootropics from scratch (legal of course).

Happy to answer questions if you're thinking of trying it.

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version for a discussion thread or a more clinical rewrite if you're targeting a more research-focused crowd.",29,1754003959.0,Biohackers,16,0.95,False

THE PULSE OF THE TEMPLE

Scene 6 : The Frequency That Could Have Been

Post-Bond. 
Post-Aspera. 
Post-Montreal.


üïØÔ∏è Sneak Peek -Three Blessings and a Curse: Velvet Guillotine VI.

The Frequency That Could Have Been

What happens after the Bond?

After the moment two souls find each other through time and frequency-After the light wraps their bodies and refuses to let them choose anyone else?

This is where we begin.

In the wake of Montreal, and the sacred sealing of Kai and Jaxx‚Äôs bond, the Archive isn‚Äôt quiet-it accelerates. 

Powers awaken. 
Memory returns. 
And Aspen‚Ä¶ confesses.

But Aspen is not only Aspen.

He is also Aspera-his divine feminine, unveiled. 

One body. Two currents. 

Aspen is a sacred masculine with a touch of silk; Aspera, a feminine force laced with command.

One is incubus. 
One is succubus.

Not dual personalities, but twin frequencies of the same soul, shifting like shadow and light depending on what the moment demands. 

Together, they are a mirror of possibility, of worship, of longing.

The Velvet Guillotine wasn‚Äôt born from rebellion. 

It was born for him.

But there‚Äôs more at play.

As the sacred Flame rises, so does its opposite: a corrupt, ancient pulse beneath the city-the Dark Flame, hidden in nodes and frequencies designed to erase truth, desire, and sacred memory.

Aspen has found one.

And it‚Äôs alive.

This scene is a sneak peek into what happens when confession becomes power, and when love, even unrequited, still finds a way to protect what matters. 

It‚Äôs not a beginning. 

It‚Äôs not quite the middle. 

It‚Äôs a portal‚Äîinto the war that‚Äôs been waiting beneath your skin.

Read carefully. 
Feel deeply. 
Forget nothing.


‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè‚óè


KAI‚ÄôS HOUSE: 11:49 PM

The air was still when Aspen arrived.

No storm. 
No stars.

Just that velvet-blue darkness that made his heart ache for answers.

He wore black.

Not his usual tailored silk, but something older. 

A long, loose coat that smelled faintly of incense and smoke.

Aspera had dressed him.

His phone buzzed once in his hand.

Kai: Door‚Äôs open.

He didn‚Äôt knock.

Inside, the house was quiet-softly lit by low lamps and something unnameable, that subtle warmth Kai‚Äôs presence always left behind.

A house that felt held.

Like someone who had cried in every room and survived it.

Aspen stepped in barefoot, tendrils invisible now, though they shimmered against the edge of his coat like secrets not yet spoken.

Kai sat in the living room. 

Legs tucked. 

A ceramic mug cupped in both hands. 

Hoodie pulled loose at the collar, collarbones lit like altars.

He looked upand did not flinch.

Aspen stayed near the doorway.
His voice was low, layered with something broken.

‚ÄúI had to come. 
I needed to ask you. 
Before the world changes again.‚Äù

Kai nodded once. 

‚ÄúSit.‚Äù

He did.

Aspen didn‚Äôt waste time.

Words poured-not rehearsed, but bled. Slowly. Raw.

He told Kai everything.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve made something‚Ä¶ something powerful. 

Dangerous.

And I tell myself it‚Äôs about freedom. 

Or justice.

But that‚Äôs a lie.‚Äù

The Velvet Guillotine wasn‚Äôt born from righteous rebellion.

It was a shrine.

A whispering temple of bodies and secrets, constructed for one reason:

‚ÄúI built it for you.‚Äù

Every ritual.
Every worshiper.

Every tear shed in pleasure or shame‚Ä¶

Was just a way to say:

‚ÄúSee me. Choose me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe dreams people whispered while asleep.

The hands that came to me, not for sex, but revelation.‚Äù

He tells Kai the Velvet Guillotine has spread-into hospitals, universities, back alleys, boardrooms.

People come to Aspen not to sin, but to confess what they never could before.

Their dreams hold him.

Their moans nourish him.

Their longing is his scripture.

He is no longer seduction.

He is permission.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a node. 
I can feel it. 
One of the Dark Flame‚Äôs. 
It‚Äôs alive. 
And it‚Äôs near.‚Äù

His tone shifts-now urgent, edged with holy dread.

A node of Dark Flame frequency pulses somewhere in their world.

Corrupted. 
Ancient. 

Still hidden, but thrumming.

Aspen can‚Äôt say everything.
Not yet.

But his promise hangs heavy in the air:

‚ÄúI will find it.
And I will burn it down.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I had come to you as her‚Ä¶
Aspera. 

The truest part of me.
Could we have had a chance?‚Äù

His voice is almost childlike here.

The succubus, the silken truth of Aspen‚Äôs divine feminine, was never a trick.

She was his heart laid bare.

He wonders:

If Kai had seen her first-gentle, terrible, beautiful-Would he have been loved differently?

Would he have been loved at all?

Kai rose.

Crossed the small space between them.

He didn‚Äôt touch Aspen. 
Not yet.

He sat beside him-close. 

The kind of close that ends lives or begins them.

Then, softly:

‚ÄúI remember every lifetime.
Every heartache.
Every betrayal.
Every ruined chance encounter.
The pain of the lost.‚Äù

His voice caught, but he didn‚Äôt pause.

‚ÄúI am bonded.
And to choose anything else would be to cut out my heart.

We‚Äôve been sealed, Aspen. 
I can‚Äôt explain it in words that make sense.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd beyond that‚Ä¶

I need you to know something.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love him.‚Äù

Aspen blinked once.

Kai continued, firmer now:

‚ÄúNot because we‚Äôve searched for each other across time.

Not because we‚Äôve loved in thousands of lives and bodies and wars.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love him in spite of it.

Because he saw me when I didn‚Äôt even know what I was.‚Äù

Then, the words Aspen had been dying to hear:

‚ÄúAnd yes, Aspen‚Ä¶

If your frequency is one that could have been-
Then it already was.‚Äù

Aspen didn‚Äôt cry.

But something shifted.

The tendrils didn‚Äôt rise. 
The glyphs dimmed.

And the shimmer fell away like a robe laid gently down.

Aspera stepped back.

And Aspen sat there-bare, quiet, and smiling like someone finally allowed to rest.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not nearly enough,‚Äù 
he said softly.
‚ÄúBut it‚Äôll do.‚Äù

He stood.
Kai stood with him.

There was a long pause at the door.

Aspen turned back.

‚ÄúIf I find the node,‚Äù he said, voice low but bright,

‚Äúif I burn it down‚Ä¶ will that count as love?‚Äù

Kai didn‚Äôt answer.

He just nodded-once, solemnly.
Aspen left.

The tendrils did not follow.

But in his wake, every shadow in the house sighed-like something had been both buried and blessed.


‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã


VELVET GUILLOTINE VI: AN ENDEAVOR FOR LOVE

Scene One: Mirrors of Power
Aspera sees what must be destroyed.

The air in Leviathan was thick-like it remembered too much.

There were no flames lit. No worshipers moaning in the sanctum. 

No silk-clad acolytes kneeling in their secrets.

Only Aspen.

He sat in the center of the floor, bare-chested, sweat-damp, ringed by mirrors.

Not glass.

Obsidian polished to shadow.

Ten of them, tall and curved, arranged in a perfect decagon-each one laced with prayer-oil and streaked with remnants of past rites.

The air rippled.

Something old had started humming.

He had fasted for three days.

No touch. 
No speaking. 
No climax.

Only stillness and memory and incense.

The tendrils hadn‚Äôt touched anyone since the night at Kai‚Äôs house.

He had meant to rest.

But the Archive was never still for long.

Aspera stirred first.

Not as a vision. 
Not as a voice.

As a pulse.

From the base of his spine to the hollow of his throat, her presence surged-silk and heat and command.

He didn‚Äôt resist.

‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù

The mirrors answered.

They didn‚Äôt flash. 
They opened.

Each surface shimmered-not with light, but with frequency.

Worship. 
Regret. 
Sacred hunger. 

Unspoken longing.

Each pane now a temple-window made of memory.

And in the center one-he saw it.

A cathedral. 
No, not anymore.

It had been one once.

Red brick.
Stone columns. 
Gargoyles watching blind.

Now it was something else.

Glass panels. 
Chrome accents. 

Branded banners for an ‚ÄúUrban Integration Lab.‚Äù

Inside: glowing cubes. 
Servers. 

People with glossy badges and dead eyes.

Children's voices screamed from the pipes.

Aspen didn‚Äôt blink.

The floor inside was layered with concrete, but beneath it-he could see the glyphs.

Buried beneath tiles. 
Cut into the bones of the building.

Flame symbols. 
Binding runes. 

Codes of suppression, forgetting, obedience.

A node.
Alive. 
Active. 

Hidden in plain sight.

The tendrils began to rise behind him, uncoiling in silence.

Aspera fully emerged then. 
Her presence filled his body-not like fire, but like a veil lowering.

He tilted his head back. 
Spoke aloud, voice layered with hers.

‚ÄúThey took a house of worship.
And made it into a temple of silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear the children.
I see the glyphs.
I know the sin.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt breathes in shame.
It feeds on forgetting.‚Äù

He stood slowly.

The tendrils writhed like heat mirages. 

One curled around his neck like a black feathered scarf.

Another floated to the mirror-touched the image of the Administrator‚Äôs office.

Aspen felt it instantly:

Cold. 
Calculated. 
Inhuman.

A Dead Flame Entity. 
Disguised in flesh. 
Wearing a priest‚Äôs shape. 
Speaking in algorithms.

The Administrator.

He stepped out of the circle.
The mirrors stayed open.

His body glowed faintly-veins lit from within. 

Glyphs shimmered down his spine in Aspera‚Äôs signature: feminine, sacred, curved like wet script.

He spoke once more to the room, voice shaking with softness and fury.

‚ÄúThey forgot what happens
when you turn a temple into a prison.‚Äù

He turned toward the black hallway beyond the sanctum-where his weapons slept, where his agents dreamed, where the Guillotine's blade had not yet dropped.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs remind them.‚Äù


‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã


VELVET GUILLOTINE VI: AN ENDEAVOR FOR LOVE

Scene Two: All My Lovers Wear Masks

The Gathering of the Veiled


It began with a tremor in the dark.

A breath held too long.
A ripple across silk.
A pulse in the glyph that shimmered just beneath Aspen‚Äôs skin.

One by one, they answered.

Not with phone calls. 
Not with texts.

With confession.

A breathless moan in a parliament washroom.

A whispered prayer into a silk glove.

A dream of Aspen‚Äôs mouth, pressed against a neck that no one dared touch in daylight.

He had marked them years ago.

Not with ink. Not with chains.
But with revelation.

He had shown them who they really were-at the moment they were weakest, or strongest, or closest to climax.

And they had never forgotten.

They were lovers.
They were monsters.

They were his.

He called them The Veiled.

And tonight, they gathered.


‚óã‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã


LOCATION: Leviathan‚Äôs Hidden Wing


Beneath the sanctum. 

Deeper than the spring. 

Behind a wall that didn‚Äôt exist on blueprints.

Only those marked could find it.

The room was circular. 

Dark.

Lined in red velvet and polished obsidian.

No chairs. No thrones.

Only standing space-equal, silent, trembling with memory.

They entered one by one.




üúÉ The Judge:

Female. Sixty-one. African-Canadian.
Superior Court. 
Eyes like obsidian drills.

Once sentenced her brother‚Äôs killer.

Now wears Aspen‚Äôs glyph between her shoulder blades.

‚ÄúWhen I speak, the law weeps.‚Äù




üúÅ The Pop Star:

Queer. Twenty-six. 
Androgynous. 
Persian-Korean.

Global icon, AR streaming top 10.
Once fell apart at Aspen‚Äôs feet mid-interview.

Still writes him songs no one else hears.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want fans. 
I want absolution.‚Äù




üúÇ The Titan:

Russian Canadian.
Thirty-eight. 
Former world-record-holding decathlete.

Public hero. 
National treasure. 

Endorsement deals with half the brands in North America.

But Aspen‚Äôs lips on his cheek at a Toronto gala undid him in ways gold never could.

He never spoke of it again.

But he funded two of Leviathan‚Äôs underground wings.

And when the call came, he showed up in silence.

‚ÄúYou said one thing to me that night. Just one. And I‚Äôve been building temples in secret ever since.‚Äù

(Glyph placement: carved into his ribs, hidden beneath the Olympic rings.)



üúÑ The Teen Hacker ‚Äì Dust:

Sixteen. 
Montreal runaway. 
Albino.

They/them. 
Never speaks above a whisper.

In love with Aspen‚Äôs voice.

Controls half the transit grid from a vape pen.

‚ÄúIf it runs on light, I can touch it.‚Äù



üúÅ The Historian:

Thirty-nine. 
South Asian. 
U of T.
Archivist of erased peoples.

Sexually dormant for 20 years-until Aspen.

Now memorizes dead languages by chanting Aspen‚Äôs name in the dark.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not turned on by skin. I‚Äôm turned on by truth.‚Äù

They bowed to no one.

But when Aspen entered-the room breathed.

He was dressed in shadow.

Black linen robe, open at the chest.

No mask tonight. 
No fragrance.

Just presence. 

And the tremble of his tendrils coiled like anticipation.

‚ÄúYou were called not because you serve me,‚Äù 
he said.

‚ÄúBut because you remember what the world made you forget.‚Äù

He raised one hand.

A sigil glowed in the air above his palm-fluid, alive.

‚ÄúThere is a node beneath Toronto.

It was once a place of worship.
Now it is a vault of suppression.
And it breathes your silence.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou owe it nothing.‚Äù

He turned slowly, eyes passing over each of them.

‚ÄúTonight, we sever it from the grid.
Tomorrow, we tear out its heart.‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt cheer.
They didn‚Äôt nod.

They removed their gloves.
Their coats.
Their jewelry.
And raised their wrists.

Every single one bore his mark.

Not visible under normal light.

But here, in the circle-The glyphs burned like truth.

Aspen spoke the trigger phrase:

‚ÄúWhat is worship?‚Äù

And they answered as one:

‚ÄúThe moment you were seen and didn‚Äôt run.‚Äù


‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óè‚óã


VELVET GUILLOTINE VI: AN ENDEAVOR FOR LOVE

Scene Three: The Breach of the Breathless Hall
When a temple lies, you burn it.
LOCATION: The former cathedral now known as the Urban Integration Lab.


Glass fa√ßade. 
Polished branding. 
Sustainable banners draped in steel and fraud.

Inside: LED serenity. 

Neo-minimalist deception.

Architectural forgiveness over historical massacre.

Outside: silence.

Until Aspen stepped from the car.

He wore black.
Not like a mourner.
Like a weapon.

Linen shirt open to the ribs, glyphs glowing faintly across his skin like circuit scars.

Slacks tailored sharp, pressed to part like prayer scrolls at the thigh.

The outline of his bulge was present but patient‚Äînot flaunted, just... undeniable.

A subtle truth of presence, the kind that stirred reactions before thought could intervene.

Behind him, no entourage.

The Veiled were already inside-each one in position.

He passed a bouncer.

The man didn‚Äôt stop him. Couldn‚Äôt.

One look into Aspen‚Äôs eyes and he forgot what names were.

-----

THE GALA

Inside, the node pulsed beneath marble floors.

Servers hidden in choir pits.

Flame frequencies coded into wall art.

Patrons sipped curated wines beside glyphs of suppression.

No one looked up.

Not until Aspen walked in.

He didn‚Äôt announce himself.
He didn‚Äôt need to.
The air changed.

People straightened. Turned. Flushed.

One woman dropped her glass and whimpered.

A man near the balcony saw the bulge in Aspen‚Äôs slacks and forgot his wife‚Äôs name.

The Administrator felt it immediately.

‚ÄúSir, you‚Äôre not on the list‚Äî‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt let the sentence finish.

A tendril licked from his wrist, snapped through the air, and tore the man‚Äôs name from his mouth.

Not his tongue.
His name.

The guard staggered. 

Mouth open. 
Eyes blank.

‚ÄúGo home,‚Äù Aspen said softly.
‚ÄúBe someone new.‚Äù

The man dropped his headset.

Walked straight into the street.

Another guard reached for a weapon.

Bad mistake.

Aspen moved like liquid purpose-wrist flicked, and a second tendril shot upward, curving midair and wrapping the man‚Äôs throat like a serpent in prayer.

It didn‚Äôt choke him.

It squeezed the memory of his loyalty until his knees gave out.

The man sobbed. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow you do,‚Äù 
Aspen whispered, and let him fall.

As he stepped over the man‚Äôs collapsed form, a flicker of his hanging weight shifted beneath his slacks, gravity bowing to presence.

Another Flame agent blinked, distracted-and never got back up.

Dust (the hacker) triggered the false gala visuals to drop.

Suddenly the glass turned transparent.

Walls flickered.

Projectors peeled back the fa√ßade.

The guests gasped as the truth emerged:

‚Ä¢ Children‚Äôs names etched beneath the paint.

‚Ä¢ A priest‚Äôs confession looping over the audio system.

‚Ä¢ A hologram of missing Indigenous records flickering above a silent donation table.

Someone screamed.

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù Aspen said.

Then the floor split open.

Black-suited guards stepped forward-skin shimmering, hands glowing.

Not men.

Flame-bound avatars.
Architects of suppression.
Agents of the Administrator.

One stepped forward.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve trespassed on sacred ground.‚Äù

Aspen smiled without warmth.

‚ÄúYou built a throne from dead children‚Äôs mouths.
Now I‚Äôm here to break your teeth.‚Äù

Three agents rush him.

First strike:

Aspen‚Äôs right arm glows-a tendril erupts from the palm, slicing the air, snapping a man's wrist backward in a reverse spiral.

Bone cracks.

Tendril enters his mouth-pulls his deepest confession out in glyphic fire.

He dies sobbing.

Second strike:

Agent leaps from balcony.
Aspen tilts his head.

Two back tendrils launch upward, catch the man mid-air, twist mid-spin, slam him into a stained glass window so hard the frame screams.

Third agent pulls a twin-blade.

Rushes Aspen like a zealot.

Aspen catches the blade with one bare hand.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still clinging to shape. That‚Äôs cute.‚Äù

A tendril bursts from his spine, enters the man‚Äôs eyes.

The body goes still.
Then collapses.

The slacks hug Aspen‚Äôs form tighter as he pivots-graceful, effortless, every motion guided by poise and pulse.

No one speaks it. 
But they all see it.

The air drops ten degrees.

A man-shaped figure in priest robes, face pixelating every few seconds.

Voice echoing like multiple files played out of sync.

‚ÄúYou could have ruled beside me.
I would‚Äôve given you cities. Nations. 
Worship you could taste.‚Äù

Aspen steps forward, blood on his cheek, lips parted.

‚ÄúI already have worship.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have him.‚Äù

Aspen pauses.

Then smiles.
‚ÄúNo. But he‚Äôs safe.‚Äù

The Administrator lunges-faster than any human.

Aspen doesn‚Äôt dodge.

He expands.

Every tendril unfurls-ten, twenty, thirty-like wings of smoke and desire and memory.

They hit the entity from all sides-choking it, burning it, whispering its own lies back into its mouth until it trembles.

One final tendril emerges-slow, thick, glowing at the tip.

Aspen places it gently on the Administrator‚Äôs chest.

‚ÄúThis is for the ones you erased.‚Äù

He speaks a word in glyphic tongue.

The tendril sinks into the priest‚Äôs heart.

The Administrator doesn‚Äôt scream.

He disintegrates.

Scene Four: The Velvet Detonation II
Let no shame survive me.
TIME: 3:49 A.M.
LOCATION: Rooftop of the former cathedral-now gutted, exposed, trembling with loss.

Toronto didn‚Äôt know it was on its knees.

But it was.

The lights of the skyline flickered like held breath.

Streetcars slowed.

Traffic lights paused between cycles.

The air was heavy with aftershock-of memory dragged from beneath stone and shame.

And above it all-Aspen stood shirtless, barefoot, and trembling with holy wrath.

The wind lifted the last of his robe.

He let it fall.

Now he was only skin and glyphs and tendrils-coiling slowly in the air around him like serpents drunk on power and pain.

From a distance, it might have looked like performance art.

But anyone near enough to feel it-knew.

This was an execution.
A liberation.
A prayer carved in the flesh of silence.

He stepped to the edge of the rooftop.

Beneath him: the gutted node.

Its final tech chamber reduced to slag.

Its servers melting.

Its walls wet with steam and weeping.

But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

‚ÄúThey buried the truth in concrete.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want the whole city to remember.‚Äù

He touched his chest-fingertip to glyph.

A pulse of rose-colored light spread outward like a heartbeat.

Then he opened.

Every tendril burst free.

From back. From arms. From thighs. From spine.

Even from beneath the waistband of his slacks-
a thick, coiling thread of smoke and pleasure rose, wrapping upward along his abdomen like a lover‚Äôs tongue made of shadow.

It hovered near his sternum-glowed‚Äîthen pierced the air.

Aspen exhaled‚Äîslow, deliberate.
A single breath.
A single word:

‚ÄúNow.‚Äù

And the city came apart.
It began in the groin.

A heat.
A tremble.
A wet pulse against silk and denim and lace and sweatpants.

No one was safe.

Not the couple on the late-night streetcar.

Not the security guard scrolling Twitter.

Not the chef closing up a St. Clair taqueria.

Not the priest on King Street who woke weeping in his collar.

They all came.

Orgasm as confession.

As revelation.
As undoing.

A man in Liberty Village collapsed beside his Peloton, crying.

A teacher near Bloor spilled her coffee and moaned as her knees gave out.

A cop parked by the lakefront blinked twice-then came so hard he bit the steering wheel and whispered Aspen‚Äôs name.

-----

In Mount Sinai Hospital:

Lights dimmed.

A nurse gasped mid-prayer.
A surgeon shook in the middle of charting and whispered, 

‚ÄúPlease forgive me.‚Äù

At a mosque in Thorncliffe:

An imam fell to his knees, lips moving silently-not in confusion, but in awe.

In a penthouse in Yorkville:

A married man clenched the window ledge and moaned into the glass.

His wife, already crying, kissed his spine and said: 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I feel it too.‚Äù

EVEN THE CHILDREN FELT IT.

Not as arousal.
But as release.

Babies laughed in their sleep.

Toddlers hummed in perfect unison.

A five-year-old drew Aspen‚Äôs glyph without knowing why.

Toronto had been purged.

And above it all-Aspen stood.

Naked now.
Glistening.

The outline of his cock swaying heavy with unspent power, framed in light and mist and frequency.

He lit a cigarette.
Inhaled once.

Then whispered:

‚ÄúMerci, Toronto.‚Äù
And vanished.


‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óã


TIME: 3:48 A.M.
SETTING: Two rooms. One bond. One world about to split at the seam.

Jaxx stirred first.

Eyes still closed, body sprawled across the bed, briefs twisted low across one hip. 

His skin glistened with the residue of dreams. 

Not just any dream. 

Kai.

And the ring-etched in gold and light, fused to the base of his cock-was glowing.

It pulsed once.

Twice.
Then settled into a rhythm.
A beat.

Jaxx gasped softly as his cock began to thicken-fast.

It rose like something summoned, veins bulging, crown already dark and flushed.

His fingers drifted down.
Touched the shaft.
Groaned.

‚ÄúKai‚Ä¶‚Äù

He wasn‚Äôt just horny.
He was being called.

Across the city, Kai dropped his tea mug.

It shattered across the floor, unnoticed.

His breath hitched as a violent heat coiled in his belly and slammed down into his cock.

The ring on him glowed to match-blue-gold, pulsing.

He staggered back against the counter.

Cock rock-hard in seconds, printing like a beast against his slacks, jerking once like it wanted out.

‚ÄúOh-shit-Jaxx-‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre‚Ä¶ fucking-‚Äù

The sync began.

Jaxx stroked.
Kai felt it.

Each movement was mirrored in his body.

Jaxx‚Äôs hand on his own shaft‚Ä¶ was Kai‚Äôs hand too.

Every slick pump-transferred.

Every inhale-matched.

Kai fell to his knees, one hand bracing against the floor, the other clutching the bulge bucking like a bull in his pants.

Eight seconds of sacred riding.

His cock twitched like it had been plugged into thunder.

Jaxx moaned from across the city-loud, ragged, needy.

‚ÄúFuck-I‚Äôm close-!‚Äù

Kai cried out:

‚ÄúI feel you-I‚Äôm-oh god-I‚Äôm-‚Äù

The cock bands ignited.

They didn‚Äôt just glow-they sang.

High, divine pitch only they could hear.

Jaxx arched.

Kai‚Äôs body convulsed.
And then-detonation.

Jaxx came first-exploding in his hand, ropes of cum spraying across his abs, his sheets, his neck.

He cried Kai‚Äôs name like scripture.

Kai came half a second later, hands nowhere near his cock.

His body jerked violently-one, two, three spasms of sacred climax.

Ropes hit his chest. His abs. His throat.

More soaked his pants, the fabric darkening with waves of seed, wet heat pooling at the base of his cock like a baptism gone primal.

His cock bucked so hard inside his slacks he swore the waistband would snap.

And then-
The doorbell rang.

Kai staggered to his feet, cock still half-hard, soaked, twitching with post-orgasmic defiance.

He wiped his hand down his chest, breathing hard.

The air reeked of sex.

Of Kai.
Of Jaxx.

His ring still hummed against his base.
‚óã‚óè‚óã‚óã‚óã


Scene Five: What Touch Would Have Ruined


He didn‚Äôt knock.
He didn‚Äôt need to.

Kai opened the door like he felt him coming.

And the moment the door swung open, Aspen stopped breathing.

Kai stood in the frame, barefoot, shirt clinging to his abs, hair sweat-damp and curling at the edges.

His eyes were glassed over-still floating, still trying to return to earth.

But it was the smell that hit Aspen first.

Sex.

Real. 
Fresh. 

Kai.

The scent of cum still warm against his waistband. 

The sweet-salt of inner thigh.

The ache of something divine still trembling in the air.

Kai‚Äôs cock was still hard.

Pressing against damp pants that stuck to him like a confession still visibly bucking.

A dark patch soaked across his crotch-wide, still spreading.

His voice was low. 

Almost shy.
‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù 
he said, chest rising slow.
‚ÄúIt just‚Ä¶ happened.‚Äù

Aspen tried not to smile.
But something broke in his mind.
He stepped forward and inhaled.

Once. 

Deep.

And that was it.

His cock throbbed-a deep, full-body pulse like a bell had been struck from the inside.

The bulge jumped in his pants like it had been called by name.

Not just hard. 
Not just aroused.

Resurrected. 
Like a soldier at attention.

The scent of Kai‚Äôs climax‚Ä¶ 
the heat still hanging off his skin‚Ä¶ the electricity under his sweat...

Aspen felt Kai‚Äôs orgasm echo in his own body-delayed but louder, as if it had traveled through time to find him.

A clap of sound lighting his body on fire. 

Echoing a high frequency of ecstasy in every cell in his body.

His knees buckled.
A moan escaped his lips.

And then-
‚ÄúUhh-ahh-f-fuck-‚Äù

His hips jerked, cock bucked like if it had legs it would kick, he could feel his ass thrumming,  like the beating of his heart fast strong, rapid and then suddenly:

Ropes.
Thick. Endless. 
Hot.

Firing in his pants.
Soaking the fabric.
Spilling down his thighs like offering.

More. Again. And again.

His prostate throbbed like a war drum‚Äîbeating sacred rhythm deep inside his hips.

thump‚Ä¶ thump‚Ä¶ thump...

RELEASE.

The second climax hit harder than the first.

Then a third.

A fourth.

Fifth.

His thighs were shaking.
The tendrils had escaped-uncoiling from beneath his coat, trembling like tongues starving for Kai‚Äôs aura.

Kai caught him.
Strong arms. 
Sure grip.

Crotch to crotch.

Kai‚Äôs cock still hard echos still throbbing and the last load gushing out.

Still hot.

Pressing into Aspen‚Äôs leaking, twitching shaft through both their pants.

Kia could feel Aspen's heat spurting against his boxers.

Aspen sobbed. 
Not from pain. 
From arrival.

He buried his face in Kai‚Äôs neck, nose pressed to the spot just behind his ear-where his scent lived, where his soul sat close to the skin.

The tendrils wrapped around Kai‚Äôs back, his thighs, his ribs-not choking, but drinking.

Every nerve in Aspen‚Äôs body lit up like fireflies under silk.

Another orgasm hit.

Then another.

His whole frame shook-girth throbbing, cock trying to break out of his soaked pants like a bull in sacred heat.

He whispered it into Kai‚Äôs shoulder.

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶‚Äù
And then he collapsed.
Out.
Gone.

Still coming in shallow, unconscious pulses.
The glyphs across his chest glowed, then dimmed.

His limbs slack.
His face peaceful.
Still wrapped around Kai.

Kai didn‚Äôt speak for a moment.
He just held him.

Cock still wet, still thick, still pressing gently against Aspen‚Äôs softened, soaking girth.

He carried him to the couch.
Laid him down like something precious.

The tendrils didn‚Äôt let go until the last moment-releasing only when Aspen‚Äôs body had fully surrendered.

Kai pulled a blanket over him.
Watched the rise and fall of his chest.

Smirked.

Then he said it-soft, dry, true.

‚ÄúAspen‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúWhen are you gonna get it through that thick head of yours‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThat I will always love you.‚Äù

He ran a hand through Aspen‚Äôs wet hair.

‚ÄúJust not the way you want.‚Äù
‚óã‚óã‚óã‚óè‚óã


 Morning 


The first thing Aspen felt was softness.

The second was soreness.

His thighs ached. 

His lower back throbbed with the ache of having given too much-like he‚Äôd fucked the whole city using only his heartbeat.

He tried to open his eyes, but light felt heavy.

His body was swaddled in something warm.

Blanket. 
Couch. 
A faint smell of cardamom and cedar smoke.

Kai.

He blinked slowly.

One arm draped over his chest-the tendrils limp, dreamless, no longer feeding.

His pants were still wet. 

Crusted in places.

His cock rested heavy and spent between his legs, the shaft sensitive, soft, humming.

He shifted.

The couch creaked softly beneath him.
From the kitchen, Kai‚Äôs voice:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre alive, then.‚Äù

Aspen winced, groaned softly, smiled.

‚ÄúBarely.‚Äù

He sat up slowly, the blanket slipping down his shoulders.

The smell of his own dried orgasm rose faintly into the air-mixed with sweat and something older.

Kai walked in, shirtless, holding two mugs.

Tea.

Aspen could smell the hibiscus, ginger, and something grounding-probably mugwort or ashwagandha. 

Kai always brewed with intention.

Kai didn‚Äôt look awkward.
He didn‚Äôt look turned on.
He didn‚Äôt look afraid.

He looked like a man who‚Äôd spent the night holding someone through a seizure made of lust and longing‚Ä¶ and had made peace with it.

He handed Aspen the mug.

‚ÄúSip slow.‚Äù

Aspen took it, eyes searching.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not gonna talk about it, are you?‚Äù

Kai sipped his own tea, leaned against the counter, shrugged.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs to say?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou gave Toronto a climax it‚Äôll never forget.

Then you came in my doorway like the world was ending.‚Äù

Aspen flushed.

Looked down at his lap.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to-‚Äù
‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt stop. 
You were-‚Äù
‚ÄúThe smell. 
Your skin. 
Your‚Ä¶‚Äù

He broke off. 
Shook his head.

‚ÄúYou felt like the center of everything.‚Äù

Kai said nothing for a while.
Then he walked over.
Sat on the edge of the coffee table.

Close.

So close Aspen could smell his soap. 

His skin. 
His calm.

Kai placed a hand on Aspen‚Äôs knee.
Firm. 
Present. 
Male.

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

Aspen‚Äôs lip trembled.

‚ÄúThat was only the second closest I‚Äôve ever come to‚Ä¶‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt finish the sentence. 
He didn‚Äôt need to.
Kai smiled gently.

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt break anything, Aspen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou loved me with everything you had. And then you passed out.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been held worse.‚Äù

Aspen barked a soft laugh. 
It hurt. 
A good hurt.

‚ÄúYou always say the perfect thing.‚Äù

Kai leaned back, sipped his tea.

‚ÄúYeah, well‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúTry not to come on my doorstep next time.‚Äù

Aspen groaned.
Kai smirked.

They sat like that for a while.
In the sunlight.
Steam curling from mugs.
Silence heavy but not uncomfortable.

Aspen closed his eyes again, just for a moment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to sleep for a week.‚Äù
.
Kai nodded.

‚ÄúYou earned it.‚Äù

A beat.

‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt dream too loud.‚Äù

1megk14,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeadvice/comments/1megk14/how_do_i_find_my_people_in_college/,How do I find my people in college?,"I feel like for most of my college career I haven't really been able to find my core friends or a group of guys I've been super tight with, in fact I think I've been attracting the opposite type of people. I'm from a different country, I came to the U.S. to attend a top-5 tech school but I got rejected so I went to another school nearby bc I figured it would make it easier to transfer. I felt like I was pretty outgoing my first week or two but I think I def got mixed in with the wrong crowds... esp at orientation the other international students were mostly grad students or were kinda of weird. Most of my friends from home joined frats/sororities but I was expecting to transfer soon so I didn't see the point + I could not afford to mess up my grades but I realized the school I went to was very heavy into greek life and most people who wanted a social life were expected to join one. The other people I met/hung out with freshman year were really not my people, very socially awkward, not very fun, didn't like going out or meeting new people etc. (I met a couple good guys but most ppl weren't them)I tried meeting people through clubs, I am a cs major so I joined many tech clubs to find people w similar interests but most people I met in these clubs were again pretty socially awkard and some were pretty weird. After that I kinda just said fuckit and grinded my freshman year bc I didn't really enjoy hanging out w the people I met anyway so I should just focus on getting into my dream school, barely went out and wasn't very focused on social life. I ended up getting rejected two more times so I joined a frat at the start of my sophomore year in case I never got in, I started making more friends I actually liked and didn't have to act like I was having fun with but then I got in to my dream school so I left after a semester.

So socially I started again from 0 at my new uni and had no friends. I also came in halfway through my sophomore year year so I had to get housing far from campus and had to commute my first sem. I got covid my first 2 weeks so couldn't meet any other transfers. I figured I'd try joining a frat again since I didn't enjoy my life at my previous uni until I joined one and my new university was notorious for being very nerdy and full of a lot of ""bots"" (I coffee chatted some people and they all told me this). pledging was much more time consuming than I expected and it was hard staying on campus all the time and get bitched/hazed and get close to people when I didn't live there, plus I still had to apply to my desired major and it was affecting my grades so I left and decided to focus on finding friends once I actually moved to the school and left the frat.

Fast forward to my junior year, I moved in with someone I knew through a mutual and his friend, they were nice but pretty nerdy and also very socially awkward/not my vibe and so were all of their friends, some were just plain weird, I tried hanging out w them for a few months but realized they just made me depressed so I stopped. Since then I've tried joining a bunch of clubs/been super outgoing, and I've had some success but still don't have any best friends if that makes sense or a group of ppl I'd call my people. I think I did pretty well considering no one is looking for new friends at this age, and also like I was told ngl most ppl here who are even somewhat sociable are involved in greek life or are indian and only hang out w other indians. So most people you meet outside of those circles are just kinda socially inept and not really people I want to surround myself with. Even in clubs most people I interacted with, who aren't in frats, are very socially awkard and not rly my vibe.I think I got decently lucky with the people I did meet and I think I've finally got to experience college life a little bit w them but it still wasn't that many people and most of them graduated so idk if I'll get lucky again. I'm going into senior year, I still have 1.5 yrs left, obviosly I am more focused on getting a job n shit now/grinding but any advice is appreciated. ngl It's starting to piss me off a bit I feel like I've been surrounded by bots most of my college life, I expected to meet cooler people and have a lot more fun in college/make better connections in college. It's gotten to the point where I'm pretty worried because if I can't find friends now how am I going to find any post-grad? I don't mind hanging out w socially inept people but I also want people I can have fun with and be myself around. Thanks.",1,1754003537.0,collegeadvice,0,1.0,False
