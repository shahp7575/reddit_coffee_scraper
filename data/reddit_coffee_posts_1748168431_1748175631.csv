This exploratory endeavor seeks to demystify the sequence of events commonly encountered upon the commission of a faux pas—specifically, the curious case where one finds oneself adorned in the proverbial blush.

Our subject tonight centers on an impromptu, yet inadvertent, overshare during a conversational exchange that disrupted social equilibrium, inducing a pronounced rush of cutaneous crimsoning prominent in the facial region, particularly the cheeks. Initial observation reveals a dual-stage process: a precipitating verbal miscalculation followed by a pronounced physiological response characterized by dilation of dermal vessels—colloquially understood as blushing—transiently afflicting the epidermal layer.

This analysis involves rigorous stage-by-step scrutiny of the aforementioned verbal misalignment during a social discourse—one where I might've prematurely voiced an opinion on reality TV drama that was perhaps not universally shared among my peers. The resultant awkward silence was empirically measured in subjective time, lasting approximately three eternally harrowing seconds, followed by the physical manifestation of heat and the peculiar hue referred to herein as 'embarrassment red.'

Notably, this observable blush triggers what I hypothesize to be a copious dispersion of self-consciousness hormones (hypothetical terminology), originating in the cortex and cascading rapidly through the emotional processing centers. Simultaneously, an involuntary cognitive replay attempts, albeit in vain, to rectify the social gaffe, thus exacerbating the crimson flush.

In conclusion, the delicate art of social interaction demands an understanding of emotional dynamics akin to a balancing act on a tightrope of interpersonal etiquette. The phenomena of blushing, awkward pauses, and internally cringing all play their roles in this grand experiment of human relations. As data collection continues, I'm left hypothesizing: perhaps increased exposure to such social stimuli could diminish the intensity of reactions, a sentiment surely worth further exploration over a comforting cup of coffee and a re-run of my favorite chill TV show.",3,1748175201.0,feelingsUnderMicrosco,0,1.0,False

Hi everyone,
I’m hoping to get some feedback or insight on what might be going on. I’ll be attaching my bloodwork results from August and December 2024, and I’m currently waiting on another set for comparison.

Background:
	•	Age: 40
	•	Gender: Female
	•	Current weight: 110 kg (243 lbs)
	•	Goal weight: 90 kg (200 lbs)
	•	Family history:
	•	Dad’s side: Type 2 diabetes, heart disease
	•	Mom’s side: Not much to note

Lifestyle & Diet:
For the past 10–12 months, my routine and meals have been incredibly consistent. I’ve cut out a lot of processed and trigger foods and focused on healthier options.
	•	Exercise: Strength training (Peloton) 2–3x per week
	•	Intermittent fasting: 16:8 since December

Daily Diet:
	•	Breakfast:
	•	Good Protein scoop with almond milk
	•	1.5 tbsp psyllium husk
	•	½ cup egg whites
	•	Black coffee
	•	~340 calories / ~41.5g protein
	•	Lunch:
	•	½ scoop Good Protein
	•	Lactose-free Greek yogurt
	•	80g raspberries (sometimes ½ banana)
	•	Almond milk (if smoothie)
	•	Snacks:
	•	Popcorn
	•	Protein ice cream (Ninja Creami using breakfast shake recipe) with 1 tbsp peanuts
	•	Frozen yogurt (same as lunch, frozen)
	•	Dinner:
	•	Meat, veggies, potatoes

Foods I Avoid:
	•	Bread/gluten (very rarely, maybe once/month)
	•	Pasta
	•	Oats
	•	Rice (doesn’t digest well)
	•	Cheese (rare, only lactose-free)
	•	Crackers, snack bars, cookies, chips (once/month at most)
	•	Juice, pop
	•	Alcohol (maybe once every two months)
	•	Chocolate (only occasionally)

Past Habits (Before May 2024):
	•	~10 alcoholic drinks/week
	•	Cheese in nearly every meal
	•	Pizza a few times/month
	•	Crackers & hummus weekly

Supplements
All the time: Iron, Magnesium 
Aug-Dec: Berberine, Chromium (clearly not working from blood results) 
Dec-Now: omegas 3, chromium 

I cut all of that out and initially lost 10 lbs (from May–August), but from August to now, nothing. Worse, my bloodwork numbers have actually gotten worse.

I rarely go out, but when I do (maybe once/month), I’ll have a meal like a burger and fries with a beer. Every time, I gain 3–5 lbs, and it takes weeks to get it off again.

⸻

What I’m Struggling With:

I feel like I’m doing everything right — I’ve been consistent, disciplined, and mindful. Yet my weight has stalled and my bloodwork is worsening.

What’s even harder is the emotional toll:
	•	I want to be able to enjoy dinner with friends without feeling like I’ve “ruined” everything.
	•	I want the discipline I show at home to actually reflect in my results. I feel stronger, I feel less inflammation in my body, which is amazing, but my weight severely bothers me. 
	•	I’m scared I’m developing an unhealthy relationship with food — the guilt and frustration are becoming overwhelming.

If anyone has been through something similar or has insight into what could be going on (metabolic issues, hormonal, anything), I’d really appreciate hearing from you.

Thanks for reading.

Even if my boyfriend and MIL are in between us? + update 3 years later,"Hi, this is an old story of mine. years ago I asked for advice on reddit. I eventually deleted it. but now 3 years later I have an update for the people who still remember and would like to know how it ended with my mentally abused mother in law.

AITH if I don't want my stepfather in law back in my life? + more updates

Hi people, first of all English is not my first language and I also suffer from dyslexia. So sorry if I make some mistakes. I (female 27) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend Mark (male 26) for about a year and a half now. Very soon after a friend introduced us, the spark flew and we started a relationship. Also very soon we met each other's family. His side consists of his father Harry and new girlfriend Jane, and mother Wanda with her new husband Albert. Mark's parents divorced years ago because Wanda fell in love with Albert. She often tells me that she never cheated, but that she just fell in love with Albert and therefore divorced Harry, and moved in with Albert. This all happened years before I met Mark. His father was single for years and had a new girlfriend Jane half a year before I met Mark.

Now the story is about Wanda and Albert. At the beginning of our relationship I used to come to their house for dinner every week. And now for half a year I haven't been there, because of a fight I had with Albert half a year ago. 
That infamous evening I had dinner with them again and we were now having coffee before Mark would drive me home and will sleep at my place. We were just chatting and at one point flying came to talk about vacation. I don't dare to fly, I have a slight fear of being locked up in spaces, no matter how small or big. If I know I can't get out the walls close in on me. Elevators are therefore really something for me that I do go in but the fear is always with me. In the car on the highway where we drive fast I also find it quite excusting. 
This is also one of the reasons why I don't dare to fly, and then after a few episodes of air crash investegation I am even more afraid of flying. That evening I told him that I'd rather not fly and would rather go by car. Wanda, Mark and I just kept chatting. But Albert kept shouting under his breath ""chicken, chicken, you're a scared chicken"". At first I ignored him, but he kept going.

My mother, who was mentally and physically abused by her first husband, raised me with the attitude of standing up for yourself. So, at the umpteenth time I heard the ""you scared chicken rhyme"", I was fed up and I shouted quite loudly that he should shut up. In my country that is a bit of coarse language and therefore quite rude and not very nice of me and certainly not towards your in-laws. He was surprised at first, Wanda and Mark were also a bit uncomfortable and tried to talk over it. 

When Albert had recovered from the shok, he said that I should shut up or leave his house. Wanda tried to calm her husband down and said that I didn't mean it like that, I was fed up with his arrogant attitude and I left there house. 
Mark drove me home and on the way we had an argument that I didn't feel supported by him or his mother and that they just allowed Albert to bully me.

Eventually me and Mark talked it out, and I knew before that Mark and his mother had always walked on eggshells when it came to Albert. The next day I sent Albert a message that I was going to have low contact because what he did was just bullying and instead of having a calm conversation with me he immediately threw me out. And that he, as someone who did the course to help people find their strength in the workplace lile HR, was a disrespectful way of dealing with people. Everyone has fears and bullying someone there is simply not acceptable. 

Months went by and I didn't go there anymore, Mark was more at my and my mother's house than at his mother's. 
I still had contact with Wanda, and we often met in the city, often I got stories about what sweet things Albert had done for her or Mark. Wanda tried to convince me a few more times to talk to him, but I didn't want to have much to do with Albert, but if he would send me a message to talk I would be open to it. 

But I wasn't going to crawl back where I wasn't welcome. I also told her that I don't understand what she sees in Albert, she had a very sweet husband in Harry, Mark's father and she left him for Albert. She said she liked Harry but he was a bit boring, had his rituals and often wore the same kind of clothes for years, and with Albert it was more about traveling, shopping and eating out. The feelings she had for Albert she never had for Harry. I still didn't get it but respected her feelings and choices. (after all they are hers.)

For me and Mark the relationship has become strong, and we can start a new chapter, namely we have found a house for us together. It is not big but it is ours. Now Wanda tried to convince me again to talk to Albert, because he could help us with paperwork. I told her that I am getting a bit tired of her pushing me to talk to him. I understand that she and Mark are in the middle of this conflict, but that I do not need a man like Albert in my life. 
So AITH?

answer to the question why Mark and Wanda walk on eggshells with Albert. He is a very big guy and with a big mouth. I once said to Mark that it seems that his mother may not be physically abused but more mentally. An example of this is whe I was there one evening, I was helping my MIL cook in the kitchen, Mark was still add work and Albert came into the living room (house has a fairly open kitchen to the living room) Albert saw that the sound system was straight on the cupboard. He shouted very loudly and angrily why it was like that, it had to be diagonal and not straight, otherwise he would not take the whole room. My mother-in-law immediately came running, her head low with ""oh sorry honey, I put that like that when I was dusting the room"".

He shouted a bit more that she should put it back properly next time. I was so surprised how that went, she huddled, not looking at him en lookt scared. When he went upstairs, I asked if she was okay. And she said ""yeah sweaty, it was my fault and he's a bit stressed"". I said that that wasn't normal, and she said that every house has its things and that I shouldn't worry too much about it. I also discussed this with Mark but he also said that it happened more often. Mark who has lived with them since he was 8 years old, didn't know any better. I tried to tell him how mentally abusive Albert's attitude was. But neither of them wanted to listen, it was just how Albert is. I let it go.

Update: First, Thanks for the responses, they are very mixed from people who think I should be the bigger person and talk to him, there are people who said I should stay away and people who even say I should do something about the abuse. Unfortunately in my place of residence you can do little about mental abuse if the abused person not want the help. 
Now the update: I am pregnant, Mark and I are expecting our first child in the fall. I am busy preparing for the baby and even though I have been prescribed bed rest due to my health, I am enjoying it immensely. We have a lot of help from Mark's father, Harry, Jane and my mother. From painting the nursery to assembling the crib, chair and stroller. My mother-in-law is still not with us much because of the fight, but she would like to babysit once ore twise a week when I go back to work. 
She tried to convince me to talk to Albert again. I got so tired of this, that every time I had to hear the stories about how good Albert is and how he can help us. And that he can help much better than Harry. After the umpteenth comment I lashed out at her a bit, telling her to leave it alone. Albert has his own phone, I haven't blocked him and he can message me if he wants to talk. And that she should leave it alone for now. I have no contact with my own father after his wife wanted to embarrass me on social media and blocked me after my confrontation and I'm fine with that, I don't need people in my life who treat me like that. 
Mark wasn't too happy about how I lashed out at his mother, but he understood my frustration, especially with the high hormones and health pain in my body. For now we focus our attention on the little miracle.

Comment on its me because i have no contact with my father, F... U. 
My father and stepmother, that's a completely different story, my father has always been difficult, cared more about my brother than about me because I was a girl. 
Even when my mentally unstable and aggressive brother beat me up because he was in a bad mood and I apparently sang along too loudly to the music, My father stood by him. So that has always been a difficult relationship and my stepmother who is antisocial and never really accepted us didn't help either. Anyways, hopefully to explain briefly ass i can: Because of the corona epidemic there were many guidelines that had to be adhered to. My father and his wife were terrified of the virus, now they are more anti-vex. When I called my father because i had a fall and if he could take me to the hospital. He only wanted to do that if I had done a test, wanted to sit at the very back of his big bus with a face mask on. He would drop me off and he would immediately drive on. I was desperate to get to the hospital, so of course I did.
Later thad month was my birthday, with the guidelines we celebrated my birthday in a safe way. But my father didn't want to come, because of the virus. I respected this, even though I felt said because we adhered to the guidelines of that time. I only received a text message with congratulations from him. Only that word. Father's Day was not much later, the guidelines had been tightened again. So I thought we couldn't come to visit ourselves because he didn't want to risk that on my birthday a few weeks earlier. I sent him a card by post with the message that I wished him a happy Father's Day and that we would quickly catch up when the guidelines allowed it again. My stepmother, with whom I always had a messy relationship, posted on social media that her husband had such bad children that they didn't even show up on Father's Day. This made me angry and eventually led to a further argument in which he blocked me.

Update: Maybe it was the hormones, maybe because I felt sorry for my mother-in-law. She was afraid she wouldn't see us or our baby much because of the fight with her husband. But I'll be back at their house again. Albert and I haven't talked. But it was more of a we don't talk about it anymore and try to treat each other respectfully. So far it's working. We would never be friends, but for my mother-in-law, Mark and baby we try to keep it nice. My father also unblocked me because he was afraid he would never meet my baby. There too is a we don't talk about it and try to treat each other nicely. We'll see how it goes!


Update: 3 years later. 
A lot has happened, first I had a baby boy. I had a terrible maternity period due to human error in the hospital during my c-section. I almost bled to death alone at home with the baby in the crib, luckily I was able to get help. I had eventually lost more than 50% of my blood. Furthermore, my beautiful son was perfectly healthy and despite the scary start and the trauma and depression that followed. I now enjoy our son wonderfully and even plan to get married! 

Now my in-laws! 
OMG im shocked myself but my MIL is getting divorced from Albert. Even though I knew their relationship was bad, I never expected her to take the step. But apparently she had not realy been living as husband and wife for a year. Because she had been in a traffic accident she was taking therapy for the fear she was dealing with.
Eventually, she also tackled deeper fears with therapy and stood up for herself more. 
She eventually realized that life could not go on like this. He treated her more like a housekeeper than a wife. When he got sick a year ago, he did little. He did nothing at home anyway because he had his wife for that. But he also did not work anymore and he did not walk the dog either. The doctor advised him to continue walking as much as possible and to eat healthily for his illness. But he did not listen to this. Even when my mother-in-law had agreed to come to our place for brunch, she had to leave early because he refused to walk the dog and she had to come back to do it. Even at work, she had a late lunch to walk the dog at home.
She remained positive to the world, but it was already gnawing at her inside. 

So she finally put an end to it. Now, a few weeks later, she and their dog moved in with a friend, lets name him Bob, she moved in with Bob to get out of the house as quickly as possible. This friendship started years ago as a dogwalking friendship when they were both still married to their partners. They went for walks in the woods with there dogs and first with their partners to, but partners didn't want to spend more time with the dogs. When Bob got divorced, he bought his own house, and because Wanda still didn't have a place where she could go with her dog. He invited her to move in with him temporarily until she found something.

Maybe you know where this is going. But when they lived together,  both in sorrow and pain of their divorce, found support and love with each other. From friendship to a beautiful relationship. It is still young and fresh, but we can already see how well it is going. She has a partner and not a boss like Albert was. 
Someone who helps her in the house, also cooks for her now and then. Dances with her in her house and just takes very good care of each other. We are going to see where this leads.",1,1748174846.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

This was in response to ""time for everyone but me""

Quick info. Him 76m, me 59f. Bf for 5 years, and time is fucking running out. 

His daughter and grandchild are staying with us. I get to see his mask slip on and off on real time. 

He used to bring me coffee in bed in the morning. I can't remember the last time he did that. 

I get up, he's cooking up a storm. (For himself, he never cooks breakfast for me)


Me: good morning. 

Him: hey. (In a low dower tone)
I pour a cup of coffee.
He starts complaining about something dumb (how packed the fridge is. That's his doing. Lol)
Me: thank you for making the coffee
Him: no response 

Daughter and baby granddaughter come down stairs.

Him: hello!  I'm making omelettes, anyone want one? (Anyone meaning not me)
Then they start going back and forth in a cherry vibe. 

Mind you I NEVER get the morning cherry vibe mask. 

He takes the baby in this over the top cherry voice that I know is fake fake fake. 
I took my coffee and left. Nobody notices. 

I know this sounds all minor and petty and it is but it's indictive of what my day to day is like with that mentally ill overgrown geriatric baboon. 
It's nice that he treats his daughter so well.

But I get the unmasked version.  And I'm exhausted.

Vorrei parlare brevemente delle etichette dei caffe' perché da queste si possono capire davvero tantissime cose ed e' fondamentale avere qualche base per capire cosa sia davvero specialty e cosa no. Mi e' capitato diverse volte di entrare in sedicenti bar specialty e sentirmi dire - qui abbiamo specialty ed e' tutto arabica! -  Nessun'altra informazione mi e' poi stata fornita. Insomma ci sono tanti red flag che si possono evincere dalle etichette ed e' bene avere qualche nozione di base per districarsi in questo modo di caffe' buoni e meno buoni. 

[Garage Coffee Bros El Salvador](https://preview.redd.it/3c6igzwyzw2f1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a84c4bf65deaefa9ce5b0d1403791252b94b960c)

Partiamo da esempi che a mio avviso sono davvero virtuosi. Cosa ci deve necessariamente essere su una etichetta specialty?

**Origine (Region or Farm)**

Sembra semplice ma anche qui ci sono diversi livelli di dettaglio. C'e' chi definisce mono origine caffe' che viene dalla stessa nazione. Un po' come dire - Questa bottiglia di vino rosso e' mono origine perche' viene dall'Italia. Vi fidereste?   
Ovviamente no. Quindi innanzitutto deve essere specificata la regione dalla quale viene il caffe'. Questo perche' mono origne puo' essere inteso come caffe' proviente da farm che coltivano il caffe' alla stessa maniera e seguono gli stessi processi. 

Inutile dirvi che e' ancora meglio quando  il caffe' proviene dalla stessa farm o coopativa come nel caso mostrato sopra. 

  
**Altitudine**  
Collegato all'origine. Non tutte le regioni risiedono alla stessa altitudine e avere questa informazione puo' essere utilissimo per scegliere il caffe' o meno. L'altitudine influenza profondamente le caratteristiche sensoriali del caffe' arabica. 



**Varieta'**  
All'interno della famiglia dell'arabica esistono davvero tante varietà ognuna con caratteristiche diverse. Man mano che proverete caffe' specialty potreste farvi una idea se ci sia una o piu' varietà' che vi piacciono maggiormente rispetto ad altre. Alcune sono nate da mutazioni spontanee, altre invece con la mano dell'uomo che magari cercava piante piu' resistenti a certe malattie oppure che avessero uno yield maggiore.   
Vi lascio un link molto interessante su tutte le [varieta' di arabica](https://varieties.worldcoffeeresearch.org/arabica/varieties). 

**Processo**  
Direi d'obbligo sapere se parliamo di Lavato, Naturale, Anaerobic Natural ecc... A mio avviso questa e' una caratteristica obbligatoria che deve apparire su ogni etichetta di specialty. Di metodi di lavorazione oramai ce ne sono tantissimi e non conoscere questa informazione e' davvero limitante.   
Fra naturale e lavato ad esempio, i profili sensoriali possono essere davvero diversi e pertanto potreste preferire l'uno per il pourover e l'altro per l'espresso o semplicemente entrambi per lo stesso metodo di preparazione, semplicemente in diverse giornate. 

  
**Cupping Score**  
Un caffe' specialty si definisce tale se ha un cupping score di almeno 80. Inutile dirvi di quanto questo parametro sia essenziale

  
**Profilo Sensoriale e Gusto**   
Per profilo sensoriale parliamo delle sensazioni prodotte tramite l'olfatto. Mentre per Gusto e Corpo parliamo di texture e sensazioni organolettiche date appunto all'assaporare il caffe'.   
Questo argomento e' davvero complesso per poterlo affrontare in questo posto in qualche riga e magari ci ritorneremo.   
Cio' che importa e' saper distinguere caffe' che sono piu' tostati quindi con profili sensoriali che riportano note di nocciola, caramello, cioccolato e altri magari piu' aciduli. Potreste trovare descrizioni come: note di frutti rossi, frutta tropicale. Questo tipo di descrizione e' fondamentale per potervi orientale su che profilo desiderate.   
Ci sono caffe' piu' funky, tipicamente anaerobici, o con aggiunta di lieviti che possono sapere anche di cheesecake alla fragole. Quindi occhio all'etichetta!

  
**Data di Tostatura**  
Questa e' una informazione fondamentale perche' tutti i caffe' degradano nel tempo. Quanto velocemente degradano? Dipende da tanti parametri relativi al profilo della tostatura.   
In sostanza vi serve sapere quando e' stato tostato il caffe' innanzitutto per capire se e' fresco o meno e in secondo luogo per orientarvi voi su quando potete iniziare a consumarlo.   
Si raccomanda solitamente una o due settimana di attesa prima di utilizzarlo. Dipende anche da che metodo pensate di utilizzare, espresso? V60? ecc...

**Data di Raccolta del Caffe'**   
Questa informazione non e' d'obbligo fornirla ma e' sicuramente un plus per capire se il caffe' e' stato raccolto millenni fa o no. Questo può dare indicazioni anche sul fatto che il caffe' sia stato stoccato da qualche parte per molto tempo e quindi presentare potenzialmente dei rischi come muffa ecc.. 

  
**Confezione**   
Com'e' la confezione? Ha la valvola di fuoriuscita dei gas? Contiene chicchi o caffe' macinato (red flag grande come una casa)? E' di metallo, carta o di plastica? 

  
Qui di seguito un altro esempio virtuoso che non ha bisogno di presentazioni.  
Ma per chi non lo conoscesse, Gardelli ha sede a Forli' ed e' stato due volte campione mondale di tostatura. Insomma guardate questa etichetta e vi renderete conto del grado di serietà.  

[Gardelli - Bani Al Areef - Yemen](https://preview.redd.it/8gektvyb4x2f1.jpg?width=2546&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10be1bda34bf3900b21af694bde54ef502dc5401)

  
Al momento non ho esempi di ""finti"" caffe' specialty pertanto mostro il classico caffe' commodity da supermercato tanto per farvi una idea della differenza abissale circa le informazioni riportate. 

  
Attenti alla famosa scala di Intensita' del caffe' che in Italia si usa tantissimo!  
Cosa vuol dire esattamente Intensita' 5/10?  Assolutamente niente. E' solo un tentativo di rappresentare il caffe' con una sola variabile che puo' essere visto come un mix fra grado di tostatura e persistenza in bocca. Dimentichiamoci dei sentori. Il caffe' del supermercato e' generalmente tarato su un profilo di tostatura accentuato.

It was a Monday, I'd not had a drink for some days, and I'd been dreading the treadmill where I stayed alcohol free for 5-8 days, then somehow convinced myself midweek that I should have a drink even though the goal was to quit. It had been the goal for months, and I'd have these spells where I stuck to it, and then a random midweek night out where I had 2-3 IPAs or 3-4 glasses of wine, then back into the 5-8 days alcohol free, and so on. 

I was a gourmand drinker, or what I like to think of as a connoisseur. At the height of my drinking, before the half-hearted attempt at quitting I've described, I was a 3-4 times a week drinker.

I ENJOYED white wine, beer, gin and ciders, and not just because of the alcohol, but because of the taste, lore and occasion pairing. There was an endless variety of these drinks (Lorn knows how many flavours of each of those drinks actually exist) but when it came to NA drinks where I live, the variety is quite limited. So it felt like I was denying myself in a way, or leading a very boring life.

Monday, 17th March 2025 rolled around. I was never a Monday drinker, but I was dreading the almost inevitable Wednesday drinks, so I decided to switch it up. I went drinking on a Monday. The first place I went to had cheap wine, but I think they had mixed it with water because after 4 glasses, it felt like I'd only had 2 (they're known to be crooked, so I have good reason to believe this). So I went to a large pub near my house and had 2 more glasses.

On the way out, I met this woman peeing on a car's tyres in the parking lot, and asked her if she was okay. She started cursing at me drunkenly, and I told her I was just worried because the toilets were not too far from the car she was peeing on, and the car's owner might be offended. She went on this long diatribe about how she doesn't give a fuck, she's a doctor AND she's better than me, asked me what I know about cars anyway, what I was gonna do to her...it went on and on.

I was so befuddled...she looked pathetic. She was endangering herself. We have a really bad citizen paparazzi problem in my country, so she could have found herself on an online tabloid or Telegram group, but in her drunkenness, she didn't see that far. I went home in silence, thinking about the absurdity of the entire night. I NEVER wanted that to be me.

I'd been participating in some form of FOMO each week, thinking ""Oh no, my last drink needs to be my favourite wine!"" 5-8 days later: ""No, it should definitely be X IPA!"" The next time: ""Should the last wine I ever have be a Pinot Grigio? That doesn't seem good. Let's make it a Chardonnay.""

Friends, my last drinks were 4 watered down Chilean Sauvignon Blancs, and 2 nondescript glasses of dessert wine. 

I woke up the next day to what I like to call my last hangover, and have enjoyed every lemonade, iced tea, iced coffee, hot tea, hot coffee and NA beer and cider I've taken since. The cravings left me after week one, and my sunny outlook has become even sunnier. I've handled crushing disappointment since then without the promise of a drink at the end of the day, and I can say that life is good.

So today, on my day 69, can I get a NIIIIICE!!?

I don’t know your personal investment philosophies and I don’t intend to change that at all, everyone is open to different levels of risk and everyone’s personal circumstances are different. Whether you invest 90% into Bitcoin, Ethereum or whatever and 10% into higher risk coins like memes… idk. But if for example you do put 10% of your investments into memes, it is highly advisable to choose memes that are backed by insanely strong communities, communities that are constantly grinding, day to day. As in the past we have coins like Pepe and Shiba Inu that performed outrageously reaching market caps of 10 billion and 44 billion respectively. There is more coins than those 2 though, that reached hundreds of millions or even a few billion in market cap, they all share a common trait, they were backed by insane communities.  
A strong community provides a coin with unlimited advertisement and generally makes a coin fun to be a part of. In memes, a strong community is **Everything**

**Examples of Kendu being a strong community**

* Only the 2nd coin to ever reach a free Certik Audit(you need 50k votes), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe
* Certik rates Kendu's community at a score of 98/100, whilst other coins with a ""strong"" community are in the 70s, even though they have a higher market cap and more holders, Kendu outperforms them. I have never seen Certik give a score over 98.
* Twitter engagement rivals the very strongest
* Reddit - check any memecoin subreddit and Kendu will be everywhere - our engagement is second to none
* So many IRL products including energy drinks, coffee, merch, video games, beer and more. These products are created by the average community member, there is no team
* Pickleball events in India
* Murals by community members

Although, I and many others(both individuals and industry leaders) see Kendu as the strongest community in the space right now, you may not choose Kendu. If you don’t for whatever reason, that is cool and I sincerely wish you the best of luck both in terms of material success and personal success. After all, money can’t buy happiness, but I can buy a 5.0 litre V8, so I guess that’s close enough : )  
But if you do choose, Kendu, get involved you will enjoy it far more than sitting in the shadows and welcome to the pack!

1kv0w18,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kv0w18/aita_for_letting_my_bf_alone_to_steam_off_after/,AITA for letting my BF alone to steam off after he left in anger over the placement of a bed?,"Ok, I need some outside perspective on this, as I'm struggling to see this clearly atm. This is a long one.

My BF(27) and me (M44) met five months ago on a blind date, immediately hit it off and have a wonderful relationship, apart from one serious issue: Every time we have a disagreement about something, it blows completely out of proportion and ends in a horrible fight. Over literally nothing. Something insignificant. It always starts with something trivial, which we initially disagree on. I won’t go into detail but we have opposite ways of communicating in an argument. I have tried desperately for us to find another way of dealing with it, landing on couples counseling/therapy. but he refused. Only recently has he -  very reluctantly, I must say, agreed to couples therapy, under the condition that he choose the therapist. None found yet (some practical issues so don’t blame him for that)

In my opinion, the problem starts when I do not agree with BF. I am a rational type and he is emotional. He thinks (and he has also said several times) that he is always right, even when he isnt. So when I argue against, it leads to him taking it as personal rejection, when i sincerely only try to find the best solution to a problem, and would only like to discuss the options between us to figure it out. IMO BF is a bit arrogant when it comes to decisions and always knows best, also when he clearly doesn’t, and never needs any help, he knows better. Yep, red flag. Apart from this, the relationship has been wonderful and we fulfill each other in a magnificent way. 

My stepfather is visiting us at the moment. He is a lovely guy that loves my BF to bits. So do I. But these arguments that blow up over literally nothing is killing me. I am not a confrontational type (Nordic) and BF is Latino, and we’re clearly used to a completely different way of discussing/arguing. Every time this has happened, it has nearly killed the relationship over nothing. I have repeatedly stated that this affects me badly, it exhausts me, and my patience with this happening again and again is getting very thin. Hence the need for therapy, to find a constructive way of dealing with this, and stopping it before it escalates completely out of proportion.

So to the issue at hand:

Previously, BF and I had discussed a bed for a guest room. The room is long and narrow (2.20 wide approx). I wanted the bed along the wall in the direction of the room, allowing a full size 2m bed. He disagreed and wanted it across the room, limiting the bed to 1.80 length and, IMO, cramping the room, making it hard to pass by the bed. We discussed it earlier and I initially gave in to his wish, against my instincts, because he got upset and angry, and not every hill is worth to die on. After giving it some afterthought I wasn’t sure and wanted to revisit the subject. 

The other day the subject came up again, as the three of us all in the room. We were there because we had to decide where the electric outlets were going to be. I just said we had discussed having a shorter 1.80 bed across the room against having a longer bed against the wall. My stepfather immediately said “no, the bed has to follow the length of the room, there is no other option because of the shape of the room”, hence agreeing with my original view. Also to allow for a full length bed. A 1.80 bed is not sufficient for people over 1.80, which is a very valid point, I think. 

BF disagreed and got upset. I asked him several times to please explain WHY it was so important for him that the bed was placed otherwise, forcing us to go with a shorter bed. He did not have an answer. I asked again. BF did not respond, just got more upset. I talked with my stepfather, stepfather reiterated his views, and BF left the room visibly angry and upset. Like a small tantrum. It was tense. IMO, and my stepfather’s, this was simply a practical discussion about placing a guest bed. Nothing more. Nothing personal, nobody ganging up on anyone. My stepfather is the kindest person in the world and would never ever do anything to harm BF. 

My stepfather immediately reacted negatively to BF’s behaviour and asked what in the world that was about. I explained that this was far from the first time he reacted this way if his opinion is not immediately agreed to, and has caused significant problems many times in the relationship. My stepfather shook his head and mumbled something about blowing things completely out of proportion. My stepfather was upset, and it affected him to the point of tearing up. 

My stepfather and I continued the bed-discussion for about 5 minutes, to make sure we were on the right track, and went back to the kitchen to play cards and have tea. My BF stayed in the bedroom. I did not go after him. Obviously a mistake on my part, but since my stepfather was there and I knew if I went to talk to BF, it would escalate (as it always did). I could not have my stepfather go through that. Also I did not, and still don’t, think I did something wrong. This was 6.30 PM

Our dinner reservation was at 8.30 PM. No sign of BF. I did not go in to check on him (asshole move of me, I know) but I did not want to give in to emotional blackmail (I may very well be wrong about that). So I cancelled dinner reservations, stepfather and I stayed in the kitchen, playing cards and having a little snack. We were supposed to go out to a karaoke bar at 10, no sign of BF.

My stepfather is a very sweet man and this whole situation upset him a lot. He started to cry and said “this is the last thing I need right now”. He is 81 and sick with cancer. Him tearing up broke my heart. I managed to calm him down a little. He called it a night, still shocked about BF’s behaviour, and went to bed in tears. I took a quick shower and a dip in the pool to sort my thoughts, and went to bed. BF was fuming and turned his back to me in bed, indicating he wanted to be left alone. Clearly a misinterpretation on my part. However I was under the impression I did nothing wrong, and I felt (and still feel) that it was not my job to smooth this over. I don't respond well to emotional manipulation.

Next morning I got up early as usual, made coffee and breakfast for stepfather and me (BF is a late sleeper so he usualy has breakfast at his convenience later). After breakfast I went into the bedroom and asked if he was going to stay there and be grumpy or come out (not the best choice of words). He was on his laptop and snerred back that “he was busy”. I left the bedroom. 

After a couple of hours, he came out, greeted my stepfather, exchanged a cold hello with me, and took some food back to the bedroom.

A few hours after that, BF opened the door and demanded my presence in the bedroom. Not a “can we talk”. The tone really provoked me. He was angry over nothing and ignored us all evening and morning, and then started the communication like this. But, he initiated communications, which I should have done. Anyways.

Well, to sum it up, he was very angry with me for not coming after him to talk about my behaviour, and apologise. He felt ignored, why did I ask for his advice if I dont follow it, we already had an agreement of using the smaller bed, how could we make a decision without hearing him out etc. 

Unfortunately I kinda lost it there and got angry back, which I should not have. I said it was preposterous that I should apologise, all the while it was he turning an insignificant discussion about the placement and size of a guest bed into something about him. This was not about HIM. I agreed we had already settled for a smaller bed, but he must be able to deal with people changing their minds from time to time, and that this was not for him or my benefit, but for the comfort of a GUEST. I reminded him that I asked him several times for his reasons, that HE left the discussion and the decision was made AFTER he chose to leave. BF reiterated his views. I raised my voice and said (again) that I am f-ing tired of having things blow completely out of proportion every time, turning a simple discussion about something trivial into something about him, resulting in a horrible fight every time. And I said (again) this is why I want us to go to couples therapy, and that this is something that belongs with a mediator, since we are not able to communicate when aggrevated. I also said this is ruining my stepfather’s stay, I will not accept this to continue to affect him. So either we take this issue to a therapist, or wait it out until my stepfather leaves in 5 days, because this will blow up (as it always does). He refused. I told him I could take BF to stay with a friend until my stepfather left. No. The rest of the argument is blurry, but I remember BF saying he refused to take this to a therapist and I demanded we do. The rest is blurry, but we both kept our stances and the unfortunate result was that we broke up while being angry. I said if therapy is off the table then there is now point in continuing this and have the same thing happen again, effectually forcing a break up. I told him I’d take him to his friend. I should have calmed down, but my anger got to me. I have not been this angry for at least 20 years. I am usually very calm and have never had these kind of arguments in previous relationships. My stepfather overheard everything of course, and broke down in tears.

BF started packing his things. After an hour, he had calmed down and wanted to talk. I was horribly upset, and unfortunately was not very receptive. I did not manage well at all, and with my stepfather affected and all the emotions, I  did not handle it. I was angry with BF for provoking this and subjecting my stepfather to this, and rejected his attempts of talking. In my opinion he provoked this situation and blamed me for it (and I know I may be very wrong here) but that’s how it is for me. That has been a topic many times before, btw. I have explained rationally many times when we both were calm that these situations drain me physically and emotionally, and that I need to have time to calm before talking. And that this is not something I can have in my relationship, as it affects me badly. It feels like he is picking a fight and escalating it. Some people like to argue things out in anger, good on them, I can’t. I do not anger easily, but if I do, I need time to process, and I’ve been very clear to communicate that.

Anyway, a few hours later, while both were a a bit calmer, we had a quick talk on ex’s initiative, to clear the air and separate our ways as friends, He was very sweet about it. I was tearing up and tried my best. It was a horrible breakup. I love him and I’m completely crushed over this. He thanked me sincerely for our time together and I managed to say a few words also. We both said we were sorry. I drove him to his friend in a dissociated state. 

Now I am trying to puzzle the pieces together. My stepfather is still upset about this, it breaks my heart to see him tear up.

There are obviously some other red flags in the relationship, but those are manageable. I’d really appreciate some outside opinions here. Clearly I need to work on my anger, as this threw me off. However I don’t feel guilty for what happened initially, but clearly should have dealt with it differently.

AITA for letting my BF alone to steam after he left in anger over the placement of a bed?

Will address any questions as they come up. Thank you for any advice or opinions, harsh or not. ",0,1748174523.0,AITAH,1,0.5,False
1kv0ue2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1kv0ue2/coffee_newbie_pixie_or_vertuoplus_for/,Coffee Newbie: Pixie or VertuoPlus for lattes/cappuccinos,"Hey. I am a coffee newbie and want advice on what to buy. I mainly want to make lattes/cappuccinos (a sweet, smooth, creamy drink).

I am deciding between the Pixie or VertuoPlus. The VertuoPlus is on sale at Costco and includes the frother and an extra $25 credit for $150. While the Pixie is costlier at $180 with no milk frother (I'd need to buy one separately for $35). So the VertuoPlus is better out of the pocket. But, the OL pods are much cheaper, so in the long term, even after a year, I calculated that the Pixie would be cheaper.



Some questions:

* Is 1 espresso pod enough for a latte? In the long term, I calculated the Pixie to be cheaper, but that was assuming I'll be using 1 pod per latte. With the VertuoPlus, there's the double espresso option, while with the Pixie, if I have to use 2 pods, it would null the savings — since 2 OL pods cost = 1 Vertuo pod cost — and that would make the VertuoPlus the better deal (cheaper upfront)

* What is the better machine for you? I am mainly interested in taste, cost, reliability, and ease of use.",1,1748174387.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

It’s a long story and I’ve shared it a year or two ago. 
This story takes place in late march of this year 2025. 
We rented Room361 and didn’t expect anything because they say Room 311 is the room with stories. 
It was a typical day in a new hotel. 
We got there around 4pm. Walked around the area and had dinner and 2 drinks each in the hotel restaurant. 
Probably fell asleep around 10pm and I was woken up at 2:22am to an aroma of flowers. Felt like I was in a florist shop. Walked around my room. ( it was a suite) checked the hallway and saw nothing. 
Back to sleep and wake for the day at 6:30 and go get us coffee. 
I can slightly smell it in the hallway but it dissipates as I walk away from my door. 
On the way back I run into a maintenance worker and ask if they pump air freshener through the a/c or heating units. He says no and asks why… I tell him and he says “ You should tell them at the desk”. 
We go down to the lobby at 9 and stop by the desk. All 3 workers at the desk are surprised by my story and have not heard anything like it. 
I thought they were pulling my leg to be honest with you. 
The next night I wake again to the aroma again. Slightly less powerful and look at the clock and it’s 2;22am again!!!
I woke my fiancé this time looking for validation, I didn’t wake her the first night because she loves her sleep and I thought it was the hotel supplying the aroma. 
She gets all wide eyed and awake and can smell it also. We looked around and couldn’t find a source. 
We both fell back to sleep and in the morning it was gone. 
Sorry to make the story so long but it’s the only way to explain it. 
Our 3rd night in the hotel was uneventful even though I woke at 2:23  but there was no flower aroma in the room. 
Has anyone dealt with a situation like this? I’m not saying we were visited by anything or anyone. But this has me intrigued and wondering if anyone has had similar

1kv0sks,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kv0sks/does_sweetcrispy_ice_maker_rfegt85_really_deliver/,Does Sweetcrispy Ice Maker RFEGT85 Really Deliver? Comprehensive Review for Ice Enthusiasts!,"The Sweetcrispy Ice Maker RFEGT85 caught my attention as someone who uses a lot of ice daily. From smoothie prep on busy mornings to cooling drinks at evening get-togethers, an ice maker with quick and efficient performance seemed like the kind of product that would simplify my life. After using it in various scenarios for about ten days, I’ve gathered some honest thoughts on its functionality. While the product has its strengths, there are also a few elements that might not work for everyone.  

**Design and Build**  
The compact size of this machine was the first thing that stood out to me. Measuring just 8.8” x 11.6” x 12.5”, it fits snugly on my cluttered kitchen countertop without hogging too much space. It’s lightweight, weighing just over 17 pounds, and comes equipped with a handle, making it easy to transport. This feature alone made it great during a weekend RV trip. The black finish gives it a sleek and modern appearance, though fingerprints or smudges on the exterior can get noticeable over time. The transparent window on top allows you to watch the ice-making process—which feels oddly satisfying, almost hypnotic—and this little design perk was a pleasant surprise.

**Performance and Efficiency**  
This ice maker promises fast ice production, and I was honestly impressed it delivered on that front. It managed to churn out 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in approximately six minutes, just as advertised. This was incredibly handy during a party when I needed quick refills for multiple drinks. Over a 24-hour period, it can produce up to 26.5 pounds of ice, which is a hefty capacity for a countertop device of this size. While it performed admirably for drinks and cocktails, the smooth, bullet-shaped ice cubes also came in handy when my cousin needed ice for her sprained ankle!

[Check Sweetcrispy Ice Maker RFEGT85 price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0dkhjxcdb/)

**Features That Stood Out**  
One of my absolute favorite features was the option to choose between two different sizes of ice cubes. Small-sized cubes were perfect for keeping beer chilled during our barbecue, and the larger ones worked impressively well with iced coffee, as the cubes lasted longer without diluting the drink too quickly. Additionally, the bullet-shape is smooth, so it doesn’t stick to your hands or irritate your mouth when chewing ice—a trait I particularly appreciated.  

Another noteworthy feature is the self-cleaning function. Cleaning small appliances is often a pain, but this machine kept things simple. Holding the on/off button for five seconds activates the feature. After using this, my worries about potential odor buildup from leftover ice water were put to rest. The cleaning process is simple and efficient, which enhances its appeal for users like me who value low-maintenance products.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating the Sweetcrispy ice maker was incredibly straightforward, requiring minimal effort. With just three steps—and some basic observation of the light indicators—I had fresh ice ready in minutes. If the water reservoir was empty or the ice basket was full, the indicator lights notified me instantly. Noise levels stayed relatively low, too, at around 40dB, which equates to the soft hum of a standard fridge. It didn’t disturb conversations or cause annoyance, even when used late at night.  

**Portability and Applicability**  
As someone who likes appliances that adapt to various uses, this ice maker impressed me here. Its portable design means it’s not confined to home use. I took it to a family reunion last weekend, and it fit seamlessly into our setup at the RV campsite. Even at an outdoor picnic, the machine proved its worth by keeping drinks chilled at a steady pace. However, if you’re someone looking for higher ice storage, you may need to clear out the ice basket frequently—ideal for light to moderate use but not for serving an entire large gathering without breaks.  

**Highlights**  
- Quick ice production—only 6 minutes for a batch.  
- Compact and portable design ideal for small kitchens or RV trips.  
- Choice of two ice cube sizes.  
- Self-cleaning feature simplifies maintenance.  
- Quiet operation at less than 40dB.  

**Shortcomings**  
- Limited storage in the ice basket.  
- Exterior is prone to smudges and fingerprints.  
- Needs frequent water refills for full-day use.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
I’ve come across other similarly compact ice makers, like the GE Opal Nugget Ice Maker and Igloo’s countertop models. The GE machine has the ability to create chewable nugget ice, which some may prefer, but it comes at a significantly higher price point. Igloo’s products are closer in price, but they don’t offer as many convenience features, like self-cleaning, and usually take longer to produce ice. While those competitors might excel in certain areas like aesthetics or specific ice types, the Sweetcrispy product shines in its practicality and versatility. 

**Quality for Price**  
Considering what this appliance offers, I’d say the cost aligns reasonably with its features. It doesn’t aim for fancy gimmicks but rather focuses on functionality that supports everyday use. Its efficiency and convenience make it a worthy contender in its price bracket, particularly for individuals or small families. While not the cheapest on the market, it’s far from the most expensive, and the additional practical features make it worth the splurge for convenience lovers.

The other day I went into interview for a coffee barista position (it was my first time doing an interview for a position like that) 

I walked in with a coffee from another shop. (It was a genuine mistake, I usually always have a drink in my hand- especially coffee or water) 

The manager I was interviewing with called me out on it the first thing after greeting me and said “I’m sorry but why do you have a coffee in your hand” you see how that looks right? Like do you understand how bad that looks” 

I apologized and told him it slipped my mind but he gave me an attitude the whole “interview” and didn’t even take me aside to interview me properly but had me just kind of stand there while he roasted beans and asked me questions. 
He asked me a bunch of questions unrelated to the job position and then laughed at my music taste and my major in school. 

I told him I was passionate about social causes and then before ending the interview he told me that I shouldn’t be “political” in the workplace and he wasn’t stocked about what I said. Umm ok? 

I understand what I did may not have been professional but I feel like the way he addressed it and treated me an an individual was super rude? Or am I tweaking?

My itinerary was a little all over the place because I was visiting friends who had their own plans so I sometimes joined them and sometimes went off on my own. 


Day 1- landed in NRT. Took an express train but got confused if it goes to shinjuku or not so we got off at Tokyo station and took a cab for like $40. 

Got dinner at the takashimaya Times Square mall in shinjuku, grabbed 7/11 snacks for hotel and went to bed. 

Day2: 3D cat head in shinjuku, the Godzilla head are very walkable from shinjuku and next to each other. Also stumbled upon a Don Quixote in this area so did some shopping. 

Afternoon met with friends and went to the Senso-ji temple and did the kimono rental. Loved this, felt like a Disney princess. In the evening we went to Tokyo tower and it was so nice to see it lit up at night. 

Day3: train to lake kawaguchiko area, rented car and hiked to Chureito pagoda. This hike was medium hard for me! We drove to lake yamanasha and got brunch at the park which does the fluffy pancakes with the Fuji view. Dinner was served by hotel but it was traditional Japanese food and i kinda hated it (sorry)

Day4: fuji again, went to shiba Zakura gardens and the tea garden. Relaxed at hotels private hot spring

Day5: back to Tokyo, went to harajuku (great for shopping and eating snacks like crepes, the potato tornado, tanghulu but it’s insanely crowded) 

From harajuku walked to meiji jingu shrine. Very beautiful and green and relaxing. 

Walked to Shibuya and saw the crossing. Yes it’s like Times Square x 10 but wanted to see it as mt first time in Japan. Also walked to Hachi statue which is around the corner. 

Day 6: kamakura day trip, took a train from Tokyo. We happened to go there same day as multiple school field trips so this was also insanely crowded. Saw the bamboo forest and did the matcha tea thing that’s part of itwhich was nice. Took local bus to the big Buddha which is also cool. Also took a train down to the beach area where the train crosses from the famous anime movie. Took train back to Tokyo at night and got ramen and a second donki trip


Day 7: happened to be in Ueno bc was staying with friends and such a drastic difference from staying in Shinjuku, more locals and more quiet. Walked to Nezu shrine in the morning, saw Hachi at Tokyo university and then went to airport. From ueno station, the skyliner is super fast and easy to go back into NRT … about 45 mins and $24 or so 


Notes:
Credit cards accepted everywhere in Tokyo ..the only time I needed cash was mt fuji and kamakura. No one took card there except 7/11 so make sure you bring cash for food and tourist attraction tickets. 


Shinjuku and Shibuya areas are crazy and overwhelming but for a short time and for tourists I think it’s not a bad area to stay bc there are a million food places, train stations and things to do nearby 

Usually people say if you see something, buy it because you may not see it again. This did not hold true for me because I feel like I saw the same souvenirs everywhere. Unless you want something specific like pop marr characters or some hello kitty doll or something, you can find the same souvenirs in most places like magnets and little pouches. If you love something, definitely buy it. But don’t panic buy like me because I got a lot of stuff and then found better versions of later on. Donki is overwhelming … I also liked shopping at Daiso and Seria a lot. I was not gonna shop in Uniqlo since we have it in the USA but they had a lot of stuff you would not get here so o grabbed a bunch of tshirts. They also had really cute I love Japan tshirts so you can def find souvenirs in Uniqlo too! 

Trains are not too hard to figure out if you are from NYC and if you can follow google maps, it tells you everything down to the platform and the car you should sit in for fastest exit. Suica card also works when you tap your phone while it’s locked. 


7/11 snacks - omg I was obsessed and prob ate there every morning and got snacks at night to eat before bed. The little smoothies, egg sandwiches, pancakes with the syrup in the middle, I loved 90% of what I ate from there. 

Japanese people were extremely kind, polite and helpful to us. I had some reservations because I heard they can be slightly racist but everyone we came across was super friendly. Even in more remote areas of kawaguchiko, we met the loveliest couple who ran a coffee shop. They had alrdy closed when we got there but they made coffee just for us and didn’t even take money.  

Also everyone was right, the royce chocolates that you can only get at the airport were really good. I got the au lait ones and they are great, would make great gifts and souvenirs as well! 

If I had planned everything myself, I could have just spent one night in kawaguchiko. It’s very beautiful but I was over it and fuji’ed out after first day. We got lucky and saw Fuji both days but I  would have rather spent an extra day in Tokyo prob bc I prefer city life more than country. I was stuck here because my friends booked the fancy hotel for 2 nights … it was beautiful because we had a balcony with a private hot spring and views of Fuji but I couldn’t even eat the food in the hotel and I couldn’t walk to anything nearby without my friend driving there so I felt a little trapped. 

I had only one short week which most people would say is not enough and don’t bother. But I think it was a perfect intro to Japan for me and I would love to go back one day and explore more. So if you have short time because of job, family, life etc don’t let people tell you it’s not worth it going for a week. Life is short, take the trip! Although Japan was overstimulating, crowded and overwhelming, I really liked it. The food, the people, the culture and history. I do think it’s suffering from overtourism and it’s not as clean as I expected (I think Singapore is the cleanest place I’ve ever been) I think for the amount of tourists it gets it’s prob hard to keep it pristine. Even then, I think it’s prob cleaner than NYC (my hometown) and more organized. I already miss the 7/11 and the vending machines everywhere! ",8,1748173999.0,JapanTravelTips,1,0.9,False

If you’re battling post-meal slumps and want to avoid coffee, exploring alternatives like Mitolyn and Ikaria Juice can be a game changer. Both options have quickly gained popularity for their unique benefits and ability to enhance energy levels naturally.

Mitolyn is packed with potent ingredients designed to improve cellular energy production. By supporting ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis, it enables your body to convert food into usable energy more effectively. This means that instead of an afternoon crash, you experience sustained energy levels post-meal.

On the other hand, Ikaria Juice targets weight management and digestive health, thus contributing to overall well-being. With a blend of natural ingredients that promote metabolism and detoxification, it can significantly reduce the chances of feeling sluggish after eating. Many users have reported feeling lighter and more energized after incorporating this juice into their daily routine.

Here’s how both products help combat post-meal slumps:

    Mitolyn: Enhances cellular energy and reduces fatigue.
    Ikaria Juice: Supports digestion and boosts metabolism, minimizing sluggishness.


Switching to Mitolyn or Ikaria Juice has made a noticeable difference in my energy levels. No more afternoon crashes or the reliance on coffee to stay awake. Instead, I enjoy a vibrant, energized feeling all day long. If you're seeking a natural way to combat those post-meal slumps, consider giving these alternatives a try; your body will thank you! 

Incorporating either Mitolyn or Ikaria Juice into your diet could be the solution you need for better post-meal productivity and well-being. Finding the right fit for your lifestyle will enhance not just your energy levels but also your overall health.

I hope you live in Hyderabad (preferably) or are from the nearby states. Keep reading, if interested. (Hopefully you’re non-religious, into rock/metal and anime)


About me: A corporate slave 5 days per week and a slow-life lover 7 days per week. Atheist by choice, Christian by birth. Non-vegetarian, but WAS vegan for 2.5 years. Telugu is my native language, and I CAN speak Hindi (with a funny accent, apparently)


Reason for being CF: I think it’s unethical to create new life knowing that life guarantees suffering. It’s also financially unsustainable. I’d rather live my life with a clear conscience and a heavier wallet. I don’t hate children, I just don’t want to have them.


Hobbies

Music: Rock and metal (current obsessions: Russian Circles, The Butterfly Effect, Karnivool)

Art: Digital art, pen on paper

Anime: Seinen, psychological thrillers (currently re-watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, watching Re:Zero, High Rise Invasion)

Books: Dystopian, philosophical fiction, philosophy

Others: Philosophy, psychology, contemplating about everything in life, guitar (electric and acoustic), singing


Vices: Coffee (apparently it’s a drug), social drinker (whiskey, beer), non-smoker, open to some interesting + safe experiences.


Preferred lifestyle: Calm and minimalistic. I don’t wear make-up, I love oversized T-shirts. Comfort > Everything. Very particular about cleanliness. I would love to enjoy the mundane things in life with my partner, while also having a few adventures along the way. When we aren’t sure about staying in or going out, let’s choose a cozy/lazy day. Also, let’s travel a bit because we have only one life, and one Earth.


Views on marriage: In an alternate universe I’d have chosen to never get married. However, in the current world, it’s socially beneficial to get married. I view marriage as an obligation rather than a necessity. My priority is to be committed and loyal to my partner regardless of marriage.
Also, big NO to big weddings. Yuck.


Hopefully you are:

1. CF (duh)

2. Atheistic/agnostic

3. No diet preference (as long as we let each other eat what we want to eat)

4. Non-smoker (specifically cigarettes because they are called death sticks)

I like cooking and so far I haven't gotten sick or made someone else sick so you can say I'm like the Gordon Ramsay of cooking something edible. I do look at recipes in terror and sometimes actually cook them. Looking for cool chatters and maybe we can play games. Or not. Who knows.

1kv0kmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepsMcPasta/comments/1kv0kmp/every_twenty_years_the_faceless_ones_come_out/,"Every Twenty Years, The Faceless Ones Come out","I’ve been contracted by the Bureau a dozen times in the last four years, mostly for sinkhole reports or rural spill assessments, the kind of work no one notices until it costs someone money. This one came through late in the season- an old mine outside a place called Evercreek, tucked in a valley that didn’t show up on GPS until we were nearly there.

The brief was minimal. A collapsed shaft from the 1930s, reportedly sealed after seventeen fatalities. The town’s records were inconsistent, and what little had been digitized didn’t match the state’s. Our job was to assess any remaining liability, test for subsidence, and determine if the land could be safely reclassified for a timber lease. In and out. No contact needed with the townsfolk beyond a courtesy heads-up.

We hit the edge of town around noon. October had already stripped most of the trees, and the wind blew low through the bare branches in irregular pulses, the way wind does when the landscape feels hollow. Fog clung to the roots of the hills, moving only when we did.

Evercreek was smaller than I’d expected. A gas station, a diner, a short main road that curved lazily around the church and disappeared back into the trees. Maybe three hundred people, if that. Some looked up when we passed, but no one waved. No one asked what brought us. They just watched, silent, still, returning to their tasks only when our car moved on.

We checked into the motel. Four rooms, flat gravel lot, rust around the fixtures. The woman at the front desk handed me the key without asking my name. There was a small guestbook by the window, but the last signature was dated two weeks ago. My apprentice, Seth, took the room next to mine.

After dropping our bags, we drove the half-mile to the mine site. The access road had been overgrown with vine and thistle, but the path was still clear enough to follow on foot. Old warning signs hung loose from metal rods, faded to near illegibility. A half-rotted fence surrounded the mouth of the mine, with caution tape haphazardly fluttering from rusted stakes.

We walked the perimeter, marking out potential weak points in the soil and flagging erosion spots. The ground was mostly stable, though I noted a shallow depression near the north side that looked fresh. I was jotting notes when Seth called me over.

Just outside the broken section of the fence was a bundle. It looked deliberately placed, not dropped or blown in. A small, scuffed baby shoe. A hand mirror with a crack spiderwebbing out from one corner. And a velvet pouch, its drawstring rotted. Seth opened it. Inside was a single child’s tooth, browned with age.

He turned to me with a half-smile. “Guess Halloween starts early out here.”

I shrugged, reached for a nitrile glove from my kit, and bagged the items. Probably old memorials, I figured. Maybe a local tradition, or just some grief left to weather out in the open. Either way, we couldn’t leave it there. Wildlife might get into it, and there was no reason to let someone find it and think it meant anything now.

Seth made a face as he watched me seal the bag, but didn’t say anything. I made a note to include it under potential public safety debris. I’d seen weirder things.

Back at the car, we loaded the first round of soil data and logged the day’s findings. The mine wasn’t visibly unstable, but the fence needed replacing, and we’d have to get a look at the shaft itself if we wanted to close the file properly. I figured we’d head in tomorrow and get the rest of it done in daylight. Two more days of work at most. Then we’d be gone, and the town would have their forest back.

\-

The next morning we decided to split the day between paperwork and local logistics. Seth wanted to get breakfast and see what the town was actually like in the daylight. I agreed, mostly because the state records on the mine were such a mess that it made sense to check the town clerk’s office while we were here. I figured we might find original filings, or at least some version of the truth closer to the source.

The diner was the first stop. It was the same one from the previous night, though it looked warmer in the morning light. Wood-paneled walls, a faded jukebox, and a specials board written in hard-to-read cursive. There were only two other customers, both elderly, both watching us over their mugs without speaking.

A waitress greeted us with a smile that didn’t quite touch her eyes. She handed us menus, asked where we were from, and then made no further comment when I said we were working on a state assignment near the mine.

“We’re just cleaning up some liability stuff,” I added, trying to keep the tone casual.

She nodded slowly. “Best not to linger past sundown, then.”

Seth gave me a quick glance but didn’t say anything.

Breakfast arrived quickly. Everything was hot, and everything tasted fine. The silence around us remained fixed in place. When Seth asked the waitress what she meant earlier, she wiped her hands on her apron and said, “Ain’t much up there worth surveying anymore.” Then walked away.

He looked over at me, eyebrows raised. “They’re all weirdly cagey about this. You notice that?”

I had noticed. But I also knew that rural towns protected their dead fiercely. Tragedy becomes folklore, and folklore turns into boundaries people stop questioning. I figured it was better not to push.

When we stopped at the general store afterward to buy some bottled water and replacement gloves, Seth mentioned the baby shoe. Just a passing comment to the woman at the register. Asked if they did any sort of local memorials up by the mine.

She froze mid-scan. Her hand rested on the top of the register for a full second before she looked up.

“That’s not for you to handle,” she said.

Seth blinked. “I mean, we already bagged it. Part of site cleanup.”

Her expression shifted, but only slightly. Then she handed him the receipt without saying another word.

We left in silence. Seth kept shaking his head the whole way back to the car.

“They’re acting like we dug up a grave.”

“Maybe we did,” I said. “Not literally, but to them? Could be.”

At the clerk’s office, I asked for records from the mine’s operational period. The woman behind the desk handed me a heavy binder without asking any questions. Her nameplate was chipped, and the corners of the folder were stained from time and handling. It had clearly been opened more than once, but not recently.

I brought it to one of the back tables and started scanning through it while Seth looked over some land plats. About halfway through the binder, I found two sheets clipped together, both labeled “Casualty Summary – Evercreak Collapse, March 1937.” The first listed 17 names, each followed by a cross symbol and a four-digit miner’s ID. The second listed only 11. The others were marked simply as “unrecovered.”

There was no explanation. No red ink or notes in the margin. Just two nearly identical documents that contradicted each other completely.

That alone would have been worth noting. But deeper in the binder, tucked into a folder labeled “Post-Collapse Correspondence,” I found something stranger.

Photocopies of town death certificates, bundled by decade. Some were handwritten, others typed on fading carbon. Most were routine- old age, farm accidents, the kind of mortality you expect in rural places. But until recently, every two decades, always in late autumn, a name would appear with no cause of death listed. Just “missing.”

The latest entry was twenty years old. October 2005.

Written by hand was a note saying a solution was found, but no other details were given.

Seth came over and asked if I’d found anything interesting. I showed him the list. He whistled low through his teeth.

“Could be coincidence,” he said, but his voice didn’t sound convinced.

“It could,” I agreed. But someone had grouped them all together, across nearly a century of town records. That wasn’t standard filing. That was curation.

When I asked the clerk if anyone was expecting us at the site tomorrow, she shook her head.

“We don’t go up there,” she said. “Not anymore.”

She didn’t elaborate. I didn’t ask her to.

Outside, the wind had picked up. It came down from the ridge in slow, cold currents. The kind that settle into your clothes and stay there.

We drove back to the motel without speaking.

\-

The next day, Seth stayed behind to catalog soil data while I returned to the mine site alone. The air was colder than it had been the day before. The sky was gray but dry, and the woods held a heavy stillness that felt deeper than weather.

I paced the perimeter again, noting where the ridge sloped toward a cluster of collapsed timbers that had probably once supported the original access trail. From there, the forest pushed right up against the edge of the old fence, its roots lifting earth and stone in uneven patterns. It wasn’t dramatic subsidence, but it suggested slow movement beneath the surface. The kind of thing that wouldn’t appear on modern records unless someone went looking.

That was when I heard it.

A faint metallic sound. Sharp, rhythmic. It came from somewhere beneath the ground, distant but consistent. The kind of sound that might have been dismissed as wind dragging through old ventilation shafts, or water dripping from rusted struts onto a hollow steel plate. But the intervals were too clean. Steady. It struck stone and rang out in short echoes, as if whatever caused it was focused on something specific.

I stopped walking, crouched, and pressed my palm to the earth. Felt nothing. The vibrations, if they existed, were too faint. Still, the sound continued for another ten seconds. Then it stopped all at once.

I stood slowly and scanned the surrounding slope. Just past the trail collapse, behind a clump of buckthorn, I saw something that didn’t belong.

A small clearing, half-swallowed by moss and leaf litter. A shallow pile of items sat at its center, arranged with deliberate spacing. Not trash, and not abandoned.

A silver ring, tarnished and bent at the edge. A folded photograph, warped from moisture but still showing the face of a man standing beside a truck. A pale braid of hair, tied at both ends with twine. All of it was placed with care, though the elements had done their best to erase the intent.

I stood there for a long time, trying to piece together whether this was grief, folklore, or something else entirely. It was too far from any graveyard to be a memorial, and the items were too personal to have been discarded by chance.

I photographed the scene from a distance, then logged the GPS coordinates and returned to the motel.

Seth was in the lobby, working through the geology reports over a coffee that had long since gone cold. I dropped into the armchair across from him and relayed what I’d found.

“Second one, huh?” he said. “You think it’s part of the same tradition? Like, another offering site?”

“It has that feel to it,” I said. “But nothing official. No plaques. No town maintenance. All of it looks like it’s meant to be forgotten.”

He leaned back and ran a hand through his hair. “I tried asking that waitress again. Just normal questions. You’d think I asked about somebody’s funeral. She said they don’t go near the fence line. Told me to ‘mind the season and let it rest.’ Whatever that means.”

I nodded. “Same tone I got at the clerk’s office. Everyone’s polite, but they’re not confused. They know something.”

Seth looked out the front window. The sky was starting to dim. The clouds had thickened since I got back.

“Do we tell them we’re opening the shaft soon?”

“No point,” I said. “It’s not a conversation they’re interested in having.”

\-

It was just after noon when I decided to stretch my legs and walk the edge of town. Seth had returned to the motel to sort data, but I needed to escape the screen for a while. The air was still, pressed down under low cloud cover. Nothing moved in the trees. Even the birds had gone quiet.

The streets were empty in that in-between way rural towns often are. Shops open but unattended, wind chimes moving without sound. I passed the church, a one-room schoolhouse, and a shuttered gas station that still sold cold sodas through an ancient vending machine.

Near the edge of the church lot, I spotted a boy crouched beside a dry culvert. He was fiddling with something in the dirt, maybe a stick or a bit of wire, the way kids do when they have more day than structure. No older than seven. He didn’t notice me at first.

I slowed as I passed, and gave him a quick nod. “Hey there,” I said, keeping the tone casual. “You know any scary stories about the mines?”

He froze. The object in his hands slipped from his grip, but he didn’t move to pick it up. I just sat there, my shoulders stiff and my head lowered.

I waited a moment, then smiled. “I was thinking about going to play up there,” I added, keeping it friendly. “Thought I should ask if there are any monsters I should watch out for.”

That got him to look up, but not with amusement. His eyes were wide in the way kids get when they’ve been told a rule that feels larger than them, something that feels older than their parents. He looked around, then leaned in slightly.

“I’m not supposed to talk about it,” he said.

I crouched a little, hands on my knees, staying a few steps back. “Fair enough. But I won’t tell if you don’t.”

The boy hesitated. Then, in a near whisper, he said, “The Faceless Ones are there. They only come out if someone opens it. Every twenty years or so. That’s why we leave stuff. It stops them from coming.”

He stood up and dusted off his pants. Then he turned and walked away without another word, not running, but quick, head down. He never looked back.

I stood there for a few moments after he disappeared around the corner, letting his words settle.

Faceless Ones.

The phrasing was strange. Not monsters, not ghosts. Not even miners. Faceless. It was the kind of story a child might inherit without understanding. Something passed down through repetition, never fully explained, just accepted.

To me, it was a bit of folklore, probably rooted in grief. A way for the town to ritualize the collapse. A quiet warning wrapped in superstition. It wasn’t uncommon. I’d heard a dozen versions in other towns across the state.

Still, as I made my way back to the motel, I found myself repeating the phrase under my breath.

The Faceless Ones.

\-

We started early the next morning, just after the sun cleared the ridge. The sky was flat and pale, the clouds stretched thin across the horizon. Seth looked half-awake when he met me by the car, but his boots were laced and he was already double-checking the survey gear.

The drive to the site was short. Trees pressed in from both sides of the access road, brittle with the change in season. By the time we reached the mine entrance, the frost on the undergrowth had already started to melt.

The boards covering the main shaft entrance were old and brittle. They cracked easily under pressure. I pried them loose while Seth cleared the debris. Beneath the outer layer, the frame had been reinforced with thick nails and rusted chains. Someone had sealed it thoroughly once. That effort hadn’t held.

Behind the final boards, darkness pressed forward in a way that felt tangible. The shaft yawned open, lined with rotting timber. No air movement. Just stillness.

I stepped forward first and checked the air with a handheld reader. Oxygen low but breathable. No methane. No signs of recent activity. Just stale air and the dry rot of long-abandoned spaces.

Inside, the beam of my headlamp cut through thick layers of dust and old cobwebs. The walls narrowed quickly, then opened into the first main corridor. Carved stone reinforced with wood beams, most of them splintered and leaning under their own weight.

We moved slowly, pausing often to photograph structural damage and cross-check support spacing. Seth handled the laser mapping, marking depth and slope gradients as we went. The process was tedious but necessary. No shortcuts with work like this.

About an hour in, we both paused at the same time. A sound had drifted up from the tunnel ahead. Faint, sharp. A metallic tick, followed by a pause. Then another. Regular intervals. Clean repetition.

Seth raised an eyebrow. “You hear that?”

I nodded, already listening harder. The sound came again. Distant. It echoed faintly along the stone, but not enough to locate a source.

“Could be water dripping,” I said. “If there’s metal piping still embedded in the rock, the echo can carry.”

Seth didn’t respond, but I could tell he didn’t buy it. I wasn’t sure I did either, but I wasn’t going to say what it really sounded like. Not yet.

We kept working. There was still a lot to do. The map had to be completed before we could even submit the preliminary risk report. Neither of us mentioned the sound again, though it returned occasionally, always at the edge of hearing.

By mid-afternoon, we were both covered in dust, our knees sore from crouching, our wrists aching from constant notation. The work was good, methodical, but it drained you. Old tunnels had a way of taking more energy than they gave back.

We reached the midpoint of the shaft and decided to stop for the day. There was too much to cover in a single pass, and we hadn’t brought enough gear for an overnight trip.

Before we left, we stacked our packs near the entrance. It felt safe enough. No one in town would likely come near the mine, not with how they spoke about it. And the equipment wasn’t useful to anyone who didn’t know how to use it. Specialized tools had a way of protecting themselves.

We hiked back to the car without speaking much. The quiet between us wasn’t tension. It was exhaustion. The kind that settled into your shoulders and made you feel older than you were.

By the time we rolled back into Evercreak, the sky had already started to dim. We didn’t talk about the sound in the mine. We just drove to the diner and ordered whatever was still on the grill. We were dirty, tired, and hungry enough to forget everything else for a little while.

The diner felt warmer than usual when we stepped in. The windows were fogged at the corners from the kitchen heat, and the overhead lights hummed softly above our booth. We sat near the back, away from the regulars who always clustered close to the counter.

Seth looked worn out. He rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand while I flipped through my notebook, cross-checking some of the beam measurements from earlier. Our boots left a trail of dry mud across the floor, and the waitress didn’t ask us to wipe it up. She just dropped off two waters and walked away.

We ate slowly, tired from the work. Neither of us had much to say at first. Eventually, Seth broke the silence.

“That place was empty,” he said. “Not even a raccoon down there. I don’t get what they’re so scared of.”

He said it too loudly. Not shouting, just casual. The kind of volume people use when they assume no one is listening.

Someone was.

A man in a booth two tables over turned in his seat. He stood up slowly, eyes locked on us. His voice was sharp enough to cut through the entire room.

“You opened it?”

Seth froze mid-bite. I set my fork down.

The diner went still. Conversations died. The clink of silverware stopped. Chairs scraped lightly as people began to stand. Some avoided looking at us. Others stared too directly.

The man didn’t say anything else. He just stood there a moment longer, then walked out. A few others followed him.

A woman near the counter leaned in our direction. “Go back to your motel,” she said. “Lock your doors tonight.”

Seth looked at me, his brows furrowed. I didn’t know what to say.

The waitress came by with the check. She didn’t meet our eyes. Then she walked away.

The rest of the meal sat untouched.

We paid and left without another word. Outside, the street had emptied. No one was on the sidewalks. No cars passing. The sun had fully dipped behind the ridge, leaving the town in that in-between color that doesn’t belong to day or night.

Windows were shuttered. Porch lights were off.

The walk to the motel wasn’t far, but it felt longer than it should have. The silence pressed in on both sides. Even the wind had dropped away.

When we reached our rooms, we didn’t discuss it. We said goodnight at our doors and locked them behind us. Seth double-checked the deadbolt, then said through the wall, “See you in the morning.”

I didn’t answer right away.

Eventually, I said, “Yeah. Morning.”

But it was hard to believe that tomorrow would feel the same as today.

\-

We woke early, though neither of us had slept well. I kept waking to small noises that never repeated, moments that might have been dreams but left the hair on my arms standing straight.

When we stepped outside, the air had turned colder. A fine mist clung to the gravel lot, and the sky had the flat, heavy color that usually meant snow by nightfall.

The town was still.

Not just slow. Not quiet in the way small places often are. It was still in the way of shut doors and drawn curtains. The kind of stillness that implies watching.

The diner was closed. No chairs on the porch, no light inside. The gas station had its metal shutters down. The general store was locked, its windows dark.

We knocked on a few doors, more out of instinct than hope. We could hear the shuffle of feet inside. Once, there was the distinct sound of someone inhaling sharply when we knocked. But no one opened up.

Seth looked around and rubbed his neck. “They’re hiding.”

“They’re waiting,” I said.

“For what?”

I didn’t answer.

We made our way back to the mine. The path had the same emptiness as the town did.

At the mine entrance, everything was untouched. The boards we had pried loose still lay in a neat stack by the opening. Our gear sat just where we left it, the dust undisturbed.

It felt wrong to step into the shaft again, but we did. The job wasn’t finished.

Inside, the air had grown heavier, not from weather or lack of oxygen. There was simply a pressure to it now. The kind that settles behind your eyes and makes your jaw clench without knowing why.

We worked in silence. Mapping, photographing, and logging. I tried to focus, but every few minutes, the sound returned.

Tick.

Metal on stone.

Pause.

Tick.

It echoed from deeper in the tunnel, always just past the last point we had explored. Never louder than a soft chime, but enough to hear. Enough to feel in the joints of your teeth.

Seth stopped once to ask what I thought it was. I gave the same answer I had before. Groundwater. Pressure shifts. Old machinery. But I knew he didn’t believe me.

We left earlier than we had the day before. Neither of us wanted to be in the shaft when the light failed.

Back at the motel, the hallway smelled faintly of cedar and dust. Our doors were closed, but something had changed.

Inside my room, on the table beside the window, sat a basket. Wicker, lined with cloth. No tag. No note.

Inside was cheese, wrapped in wax paper. Jerky, salted and dense. Bottled water, six tall containers, labels peeled off.

Seth called from his room. He had one too.

We stood in the hallway a moment, baskets in hand.

“This isn’t hospitality,” I said.

“No,” he said. “It’s rations.”

We didn’t talk about what that meant.

But I left the basket sealed when I went to bed.

\-

I woke to the sound of something slamming against the door.

Not knocking. Not a fist. It was heavier than that. Blunt, deliberate, paced with the kind of weight that didn’t need to rush. The first strike rattled the frame. The second made the bedside lamp flicker.

I sat up too fast and nearly fell out of bed. My mouth was dry. I hadn’t heard any footsteps or voices leading up to it. Just the bang. Then another. Then the silence in between.

I thought, at first, that the townspeople had decided to force us out. That the warnings had turned into action. I imagined a group outside with flashlights and tools, fed up with our presence, tired of whatever they thought we had stirred.

But I didn’t hear voices. No muttering or yelling.

Just one more slow, heavy impact against the door. The hallway light under the door flickered once, then dimmed.

I backed into the bathroom, shut the door, and locked it. It was a flimsy bolt, the kind meant for privacy, not protection. I sat down in the corner beside the toilet and tried to slow my breathing.

Another blow shook the walls.

Then came the sound of wood splintering. Long, drawn-out cracking. The groan of material giving way under pressure. Whatever was out there had started breaking something apart.

But it wasn’t my door.

The sound shifted.

I heard a scream.

Seth.

It came from the room next door. Not just one shout. It stretched out, ragged, panicked. I heard furniture scrape, then crash. Something was being dragged. Not fast. A slow pull across the carpet. Seth screamed again, then it cut off, sudden and sharp.

I pressed my hand over my mouth and stayed completely still. My own breathing felt too loud.

Then came the creaking. Not footsteps. Just the sound of something shifting weight. A slow movement, wood bending under uneven pressure. The hallway groaned.

Minutes passed. Then more.

No more sounds. No more movement.

I didn’t open the door. I didn’t speak. I sat curled on the tile floor, knees pulled to my chest, staring at the space beneath the bathroom door and waiting for the sky to turn gray again.

It was a long time before dawn came.

\-

When morning finally came, I stepped out into the hallway expecting to see the remnants of a break-in, maybe even the police. But the corridor was clean. The carpet undisturbed. My door stood intact, latch untouched.

I crossed the few feet to Seth’s room and felt the shift as soon as I reached it.

His door was split down the center. The frame had been torn at the corners where the bolts used to be. The handle hung loose on one screw, and the paint around the lock had buckled outward. Four clean holes had been punched straight through on the bottom half of the door. They weren’t ragged. They were narrow and round, drilled deep and deliberate about the width of a pickaxe tip.

Inside the room, the sheets had been stripped halfway down the bed. The nightstand lay on its side. The floor was scuffed in a wide arc, the carpet torn where something had been dragged.

A dark red smear trailed from the bed to the door and then turned toward the parking lot.

Outside, a woman in a plain gray sweater was mopping the pavement with slow, practiced strokes. She worked in silence, pushing the soaked fibers across the concrete. The red line faded behind her with each pass. She never looked up.

I stood there for a long time, waiting for someone else to appear. For a police cruiser. A medic. A crowd. But no one came.

Eventually I left the motel and walked into town. The streets were no longer empty. The diner had its chairs back out. The gas station pumps were humming again. A man was putting out a sandwich board for the lunch special.

People passed me on the sidewalk without stopping.

Near the post office, I found a small group gathered in the street. Half a dozen men and women, all standing in a loose formation. They weren’t holding anything. They weren’t armed. Just waiting.

One of them, a man in a tan coat with sleeves too short for his arms, stepped forward. He was maybe fifty. His expression was neither kind nor angry.

“It’s time for you to go now,” he said.

I stared at him. “What happened to my partner?”

No one answered.

I tried again. “What happened last night? Where did you all go the day before? Why are you acting like this is normal?”

The man’s mouth twitched once at the corner. Not quite a smile. More of a signal. A recognition that my questions didn’t need answers.

“An offering has been made,” he said.

I looked past him to the others. None of them met my eyes. They stared just over my shoulder, waiting.

I turned and walked away.

No one followed.

\-

The sky was dull gray when I returned to the mine. The trees along the road were still, their leaves half-dropped and wet from a slow morning drizzle. The tires cracked over gravel, but the rest of the world held its breath.

No one followed me. No one had asked where I was going.

The entrance had been sealed again.

Fresh boards crossed the mouth of the shaft, cleaner than the old ones we had pulled away. New bolts reinforced the frame. Someone had worked quickly and quietly, and they had done it before sunrise.

I walked to the fence. The grass around the path was damp, but a few red droplets stood out on the pale soil, leading toward the base of the entrance. The color was too bright to be old.

Then I saw a bundle.

It had been placed carefully, resting against the lower beam of the gate. A handkerchief knotted into a loose satchel, bulging at the center. I crouched and opened it.

Inside were the same kinds of items we had found before. A ring dulled by age. A lock of hair braided and yellowed at the tips. Two small teeth that looked far too human.

And nestled among them in the pile of offerings, the plastic corner of a clipped work badge.

Seth’s.

His name. His face. Still clean, still laminated. It must have been taken from the pack we left behind.

I stood slowly, holding the bundle against my chest, then lowered it again and left it there.

I pieced it all together. Something in the mines, “The Faceless Ones” that I heard about, were in there. Whether they were lost souls from the collapse, or something far older I did not know. But what I did know was how they kept them back. Memorabilia. Memories from when they were alive left on their doorstep. Maybe a reminder of their humanity to stop claiming more souls. They had solved this. Worked this out over decades. And we came in and messed things up.

And how could this have gone any different. If some hick came up raving about monsters and rituals, we'd have pushed him aside to do our work.

No one had told me what to do next. There was no official protocol for this. No field manual entry labeled folklore, no checkbox for an offering made in someone else’s name.

I sat in the driver’s seat of the truck with the engine off and opened my field log.

“Mine structure remains unstable. Conditions hazardous. Collapse risk high.”

I paused.

“Secondary fatality during inspection- body unrecoverable. Recommend indefinite closure.”

I didn’t sign it right away. Just closed the book and rested it on my lap. Then I looked back at the mouth of the mine.

I never heard the ticking sound again.

Cocoa. Coffee. Soy. Wheat. Rice. Maize. These are the primary six commodities which [are unsustainable for EU residents](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/21/eu-chocolate-climate-breakdown-crisis-report) in a future of strong climate change. So says [a 53-page report](https://www.netzerotrade.org/eu-food-imports) on **biodiversity risks**. Cocoa is in particular danger, though it is hardly an essential product. Except for rice, more than two thirds of EU imports come from regions with low-medium “climate readiness.”

>“€1.54bn’s worth of rice imports, representing more than a third of total European rice supply, is already at risk….Extreme weather events, like floods, droughts or heatwaves, are expected to disrupt the entire food system….73% of global coffee production and 90% Climate and biodiversity risks to EU food imports of cocoa is produced on farms of less than five hectares in size….Europe is already **experiencing declines in harvests**, with 2024 seeing the smallest EU27 wheat crop since 2018…” -excerpts from [the report](https://www.netzerotrade.org/eu-food-imports)

Earth [lost its largest amount of tropical rainforest](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lnngl6713o) last year—around 67,000 sq km (equivalent to the size of Sri Lanka, or Tasmania). 2024 was the first year where **more rainforest was destroyed by fire** than by humans clearing the land. 

[Flooding in New South Wales](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861gqdd8x0o) stranded 50,000+ and killed at least four. Cocnern is growing on the Iraq-Iran border that [oil companies may **drain ancient marshes**](https://archive.ph/12gRH) to drill for oil. A proposed U.S.-Mexico border wall extension [is poised to disrupt](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/18/trump-border-wall-wildlife) the large fauna which live in the area. 

Water levels in Damascus [continue dropping](https://archive.ph/GzAu7) amid a **vicious Drought**, the worst in 60+ years. The top U.S. diplomat [claims that Syria](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3v553py965o) “are maybe weeks, not many months, away from potential collapse and a full-scale civil war of epic proportions, basically the country splitting up.” [According to some Druze](https://newlinesmag.com/spotlight/syrias-druze-are-wary-in-the-wake-of-attacks/) Syrians who have already taken up arms, “**The civil war is happening right now.**” Russia, currently hosting the deposed Syrian President, [calls the attacks](https://archive.ph/5GpDc) ethnic cleansing.

Global climate change will bring sea level rise (SLR) and “**catastrophic inland migration**,” [say scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/20/sea-level-rise-migration) in a recently published [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02299-w). “Mass loss from ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica has quadrupled since the 1990s….20 cm of SLR by 2050 would lead to average global flood losses of US$1 trillion or more per year for the world’s 136 largest coastal cities.…The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets store ~65 m of GMSL equivalent and even small changes in their volume will profoundly alter coastlines around the world, displacing hundreds of millions of people and causing loss and damage well beyond the limits of adaptation.”

Several regions of China [reported record May highs](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-north-central-china.html). Hurricane predictions for 2025 are [not optimistic](https://phys.org/news/2025-05-ready-busy-atlantic-hurricane-season.html), but forecast a season less destructive than 2024’s. The UK is [facing a **super dry spring**](https://archive.ph/V7Vb1), and has received about a third of the rain predicted. 

Ammonium Nitrate is difficult to detect in air. A [new study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt8957) in *Science Advances* determined that AN levels in Los Angeles—the U.S. city with the worst air quality—are higher than expected. [Another study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-025-4447-0) says that the [Madden-Julian Oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madden%E2%80%93Julian_oscillation)—a tropical atmospheric convection influencing global rainfall and weather patterns—may cause **drier and windier conditions** on the U.S. West Coast, exacerbating wildfire risk.  

Why is the Arctic warming so quickly? An *Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Research* [study](https://spj.science.org/doi/10.34133/olar.0089) claims that increasing cloud coverage may be partially to blame. Clouds are useful for cooling during the summer, when they reflect constant sunlight back into space; but in the long, dark winters, these clouds **trap earthly warmth**, like a blanket. 

American officials are [putting climate change in the backseat](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/20/doug-burgum-climate-crisis-interior-secretary) to prioritize dealing with urgent geopolitical threats: a **nuclear Iran** and the **AI arms race**. Meanwhile, [record minimum temperatures](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1924879824423616606) in Greenland, a [record May temperature](https://x.com/extremetemps/status/1925325734609834019) in South Africa, and the [**earliest 52 °C**](https://x.com/ThierryGooseBC/status/1924872828740092139) temperature ever recorded ~~in Iran~~ worldwide happened last week.

The [growth of prepping](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/may/20/people-are-buying-crossbows-faster-than-id-like-how-prepping-went-mainstream-in-britain) in the UK is defying traditional stereotypes, and largely based on **stashing large quantities of food**. In Kenya’s refugee camps (total pop: 840,000+), [cuts to international food aid](https://reliefweb.int/report/kenya/refugees-kenya-risk-worsening-hunger-wfp-faces-critical-funding-shortfall) have resulted in rations shrinking to 28% of their previous size, and the elimination of cash aid altogether.

A [measles-positive person attended a Shakira concert](https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/shakira-concert-measles-exposure-nj/) in New Jersey. France is [planning to build a **large prison**](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7v7n81emy3o) deep in the jungles of French Guyana to hold 500 prisoners. A [**polio outbreak** was declared](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg9men89yvo) in Papua New Guinea. A [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestwater.4c00768) says washing plastics in dishwashers releases nano/microplastics. A [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125004827?via%3Dihub) of Brazil’s marine protected areas (MPAs) found microplastic contamination. 

Another [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12302-025-01104-x) tries to recalculate the threat posed by microplastics to ecosystems, farming output, and human health. The article says that soil—“which experience 4–23 times more MP contamination than water”—is the primary means through which **micro/nanoplastics** begin their journey into harming us and our world. 

>“These particles impact soil quality by altering physical properties, such as water transport, retention capacity, and porosity,chemical parameters including the carbon- to-nitrogen ratio; and biological factors, such as microbial diversity and macrofauna health. Over time, they accumulate in agricultural soils and infiltrate food chains, raising concerns about potential ecosystem and human health risks….**plastic mulching is also the main contributor of MPs and NPs to soils** due to the difficulty of recovery….MPs in wastewater treatment plants, notably sewage sludge (SS), raise concerns due to inadequate removal methods….” -excerpts from the study

Hold my ~~Beer~~ PFAS—a [study](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.4c11265) from last month says that PFAS chemicals are in your beer. **95% of American beers tested for PFAS chemicals**, particularly in areas with high PFAS groundwater concentrations. According to the authors, “beer is the third most popular beverage around the world, following only water and tea….Nearly every American has PFAS in their blood, indicating that exposure is common. Consumption of contaminated drinking water is a major, if not primary contributor to total exposure….PFAS sources could include brewing ingredients (e.g., grains, hops, spices, etc.), packaging or storing materials (storage tanks, tubing, bottles, or cans), and cleaning supplies and processes.”

Scientists have [named a “new” form of diabetes](https://theconversation.com/type-5-diabetes-is-a-newly-recognised-disease-here-are-all-the-types-of-diabetes-you-need-to-know-about-256262): Type 5. This iteration afflicts people chronically malnourished in early life, whose pancreases never fully develop to regulate blood sugar. Somewhere between 20M-25M people already suffer from **Type 5 diabetes**, and this number is likely to rise as food scarcities expand over the coming decades. 

A 63-page [report](https://globalenergymonitor.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GEM-global-steel-report-May-2025.pdf) on steel production sustainability and decarbonization was published this month. India is quickly growing as a steel producer, and the coal-intensive production process for making most steel is not really being phased out as quickly as hoped for.  “the green steel transition is facing many potential setbacks. Economic pressures and shifting policies have led major steelmakers to delay or reconsider decarbonization initiatives, threatening progress on a broader scale.” I didn’t have time to fully skim this report but it seems to be more interesting than you might think. The iron & steel industry [accounts for **11%**](https://steelwatch.org/steelwatch-explainers/climate/) **of all CO2 emissions** worldwide.

Scientists say that [*Aspergillus* fungi are spreading](https://www.yahoo.com/news/fungi-eat-inside-could-spread-110052871.html) because of climate change, and one day they may devour your body from the inside.

Meanwhile, India’s pledge [to withhold water](https://kmsnews.org/kms/2025/05/23/india-can-block-pakistans-water-is-insane-thinking-dg-ispr.html) from Pakistan appear to have set up the two nations for a second round in the near future. 90% of Pakistan’s people live within the Indus River Basin. [According to a Pakistani official](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2546603/pakistan-warns-india-dont-weaponise-water), “**Nobody dare stop water of Pakistan**.”

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency released a declassified 45-page [**Worldwide Threat Assessment** report](https://armedservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025_dia_statement_for_the_record.pdf) for 2025. The document is obviously oriented towards an American perspective, but many of its conclusions are applicable to anyone. However, the document does not mention “climate” or “environment” (outside of references to the ‘threat environment’) or “famine” or “drought” once.

>“Transnational criminal organizations and terrorist groups are exploiting geostrategic conditions….an increasingly complex national security threat environment. In addition to traditional military modernization, developments in **artificial intelligence, biotechnology, quantum sciences, microelectronics, space, cyber, and unmanned systems** are rapidly transforming the nature of conflict and the global threat landscape….Over the next year, ISIS probably will try to conduct highprofile attacks in the West….Russia is aggressively seeking foreign support for its combat operations in Ukraine….Russia is likely to continue its strategy of attrition, focused on degrading Ukraine’s ability and will to resist through 2025….Russia is entrenched in eastern Libya, and has used the country as a launchpad and logistics hub for its activities in Sub-Saharan Africa. North Africa also remains a primary avenue of immigration to Europe….China is developing scientific, technological, and naval capabilities to improve its ability to operate in the Arctic region….the rise in the number
of laboratories around the world conducting **high-risk life sciences research** using potential pandemic pathogens without appropriate oversight has increased the risk of an accidental release….”

1kv0his,https://i.redd.it/mbobvy560x2f1.jpeg,"SECRET of the mimic 2nd teaser, what does it mean.","With the mcm universal leader constantly being in the past two teasers what could it possibly mean. Well we know the coffee pot and the hanger seem to both have the mimic program to be able to talk to their owners in both situations.

We also know that the person in the first teaser is not afton its just a random worker same with the second teaser as they are legit random people.

At the end of the second teaser the film burns up at the end. But what does it all mean.

If we know that the mimic programing is in everything and legit everything it could mean this. Edwin made the mimic noticed how good it was as both a functional toy and added it to his other projects. The hanger can change its size like the mimic and the coffee pot has a voice like how the mimic does. This could mean when edwin made the animatronics he used a similar programming. This would explain why all the characters are so advanced for taking place in the 70s and 80s. 

We dont get to ever see the animatronics perform with very few exceptions. Im foxy go go go, we get to see what an average day would be at the restaurant, we see foxy run meaning that he did not need to be possessed to do so as it was a built in function. This would give a reason to that, foxy was implemented with the ability to run by mimicking kids or adult actors to do the same thing. Think about it. We know the suits where originally just people in costumes, fazbear entertainment could've had their actors train the new system hence why they act like how a human actor would in this kind of scenario. It would be programing animatronics without ever needing to actually program anything at all. It would certainly make the diners and restaurant popular enough by 83 to have 3 whole restaurants running at the same time.  

In the secret of the mimic that might be just the secret that the mimic program is the reason why the animatronics are so advanced but so much in the 80s itself. In vr the acknowledge how advanced the animatronics where and that's in the 2000s 30 to 40 years later. 

I theories that after SM we the player take the information back to William afton the head of the company, he then starts using them to make the funtimes as the other animatronics are already made. Using the mimic program, this is why even through ballora isn't possed by aftons wife she acts like him. Baby acts like Elizabeth and has her soul this might be why she's so active as the originals could not speak independently. Foxy acts like a showman, we know William was in the circus he could base him off of his own original act. 

This could also be why all versions of each character that was actually made (discarding the nightmares, shadows and phantoms as they arent actually animatronics) all have similar roles and act the same as they would've been constantly copied over and over again with the mimic programing. This would explain y the toys act strange with no being possessed and before the DCI, (obviously excluding puppet as she's very much possessed) the four toys could be mimicking the originals we know they used their parts which might contain the programing but it would also include the bad parts like they hating adults but being fine with kids. Attacking night guards and moving at night. This whole time we always thought it was possession but I believe the way SW is going its more technology than ghost and having the toys be like that is very key.

Another connection to fnaf 2 is the code in the beginning of the 2 teaser as it has the numbers 439-8757, which could be DCI 87 the year when it happened.

Awoke. Dawn-light filtered through gauze curtains. I whispered, “Morning.”

The warmth fled the room.

Something changed.

The moment that word passed my lips, it died—gone from thought, gone from tongue. I tried to repeat it. Nothing. It choked in my throat like a swallowed nail. Another word, different one: “Sunrise.” It worked. Once.

Then that vanished, too.

Language betrayed me.

Each term, once spoken, faded from mental reach. I kept testing: “Coffee.” “Window.” “Outside.”
Gone. Gone. Gone.

I knew what was happening. I just didn’t understand why.

Until I remembered.



It was the night before.

A rain-slick sidewalk. I was in a hurry, eyes down. I turned a corner too fast and collided with someone—an older woman in layered shawls, bangles, a scarf wrapped around her hair like a crown of dusk.

She dropped her bag. Apples scattered across wet pavement. I muttered something—maybe not even a word. I didn’t stop. Didn’t say the one word I should’ve.

Sorry.

I didn’t use it. Out of rudeness, or arrogance, or indifference. I just kept walking.

Behind me, she said something. I didn’t catch the full sentence, but it chilled me even through the rain:

“If you will not spend your words when needed… then you shall not keep them once spent.”

I thought it was nonsense. A threat from someone bitter.

Now I know better.

I wasn’t cursed for what I said. I was cursed for what I didn’t.



I became obsessed.

My world narrowed into syllables and silence. I tried everything: whispering. Singing. Shouting. Writing in reverse. It didn’t matter. Once used, the word disappeared—not just from my mouth, but from comprehension. As if something were erasing every term from every part of me.

I wondered—what would happen when I ran out?

Panic wasn’t a strong enough word. But I’d already said panic. And fear. And terror.

That’s when I realized: I’d started losing emotions too.

Not just the ability to name them, but to feel them fully. My responses dulled. When I cut my finger, I winced—but I didn’t know why. I couldn’t name the sensation. Was it pain? Was it shock?

Those words were gone. So the feelings followed.

Language wasn’t just a way to describe experience—it was experience. I hadn’t known how much thought relied on naming.

Without words, thoughts came in shapes. Pulses. Dull foggy impressions, like colors leaking through a wet canvas.



I tried speaking to others.

It worked—for a while. Until the words I used with them disappeared too. Every conversation was a gamble: do I say “friend” and lose it forever? Do I tell them what’s happening—and spend precious terms just to explain?

I used metaphors, riddles, nonsense poetry. But metaphor is just delayed meaning, and this curse is patient.

I became quiet.

They stopped visiting.

And I was relieved. Because I no longer had to try.



Sleep became sanctuary.

In dreams, my vocabulary returned. I wept every time I closed my eyes, knowing I’d forget entire mental dictionaries come dawn.

But the curse reached deeper. One day I woke and couldn’t remember what a “dream” was. I only knew I’d been elsewhere. I couldn’t explain it, even to myself.



I began to dread mirrors.

Looking at myself became unbearable—not because of what I saw, but because I couldn’t describe it. I couldn’t even identify it.

That’s a man.
That’s me.

No. That was used up.

Soon, I couldn’t remember what a man was. Not truly. Just an impression—a shape that once held meaning.



I tried creating new words. Hybrid creatures of language.

Fleshclock for heart.
Skyrattle for thunder.
Mindsnow for confusion.
Soulleak for despair.

But it didn’t last. The curse was clever. It didn’t just delete the word. It followed the meaning. Anything I understood, anything that carried even a hint of clarity—it devoured.

I began to fear even thinking.

Because thought leads to recognition. Recognition becomes definition. And then it, too, is taken.



I stopped going outside.

Not because I couldn’t. But because there was no outside. I’d lost the names of everything: street, air, cloud, leaf. The world without labels is shapeless. Featureless. Terrifying.

Even indoors, the furniture became abstract. I’d touch a surface and know it once had purpose, but not what. Was it a chair? A table? Had I sat here, or written here, or cried here?

All became one pale smear.



Then came the worst part: I started losing desire.

I couldn’t remember what I wanted. I couldn’t even recognize that I used to want.

What is longing without the word long?
What is identity without the word I?

Every word gone took a piece of comprehension with it. I wasn’t just becoming mute. I was becoming unreal.

I sat for hours—maybe days—staring at the wall. Not in despair. Not in peace. In nothing. And even that word is slipping now.



This account? This last effort?

A scraping. A final gesture. Like a match struck in a cave, already wet.

Even now, every line I write takes something from me. A little more clarity, a little more structure. A little more me.

Soon, even writing fails. The shape of letters will blur. The idea of grammar will fade. Not broken—just… missing.

And when that goes—
I’ll go, too.

I will forget what thought is.

I will forget forgetting.

I will vanish, wordlessly.

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself—sexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let’s skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don’t want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let’s channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I’m here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we’re debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You’re a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you’ve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I’ll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

**The Vibe:**  
Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I’m driven but not ruthless, my version of “Machiavellian” is designing a life that’s sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let’s be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

My[23f] fiancé[30m] and i have moved in together about two Month ago. We had a rouge Patch but we talked a lot and i thought everything was going fine. 
For context: I am not the jealous type. I encourage him to practice his hobby, wich is Posting on social Media. I encourage him to go out with his friends and don't care if another woman tries to flirt with him (as long as he doesn't flirt back). 
About two Weeks ago he went out partying with his friends. I dropped him off at the train Station and also picked him up the next day. 
On that evening he was not reachable. He later told me that He didn't have connection at his friends appartement. 
Ich picked him up the next day as usual with Coffee and breakfast. 
Later that day he was acting weird with a phonecall. He went to another room to take it and when i came in to ask him a question, he muted and then ended the call immediatly. 
When i asked him about it he told me i was paranoid and He was just talking to his sister. 

I have been very overworked these past weeks because i am a University Student and have a lot of work there. I also have been organising our lives but his primarily. He is a refugee and that comes with a lot of paperwork and different appointments that i make, manage, attend and then do all the work that comes next. I also do most of the daily housework. He works a fulltime job and only ever vacuumes once every two weeks. 

Anyways i woke up yesterday morning and had a very weird gut feeling. We always talked about how trust is extremly important to the both of us and He told me multiple Times that if i ever worried i could always just check his phone. Wich i have never done before. But this morning i did. And boy oh boy, was i right to do so. I only checked his instagram and not only did i find a Chat with a woman that He met on his night out with his mates, in wich he asked her for nudes and they had videocalled for over 20 minutes. No i also found 4 other chats all trying to hit up some girls. None of them responded tho. 
First i screenshotted everything and send it to myself. Then i woke him up and confronted him immediatly. 
At first he was acting all confused. Then he got mad at me for checking his phone.
And then came the 100 different excuses. ""I met her and she went home with my friend. I wanted to Show him that she is easy and not good for him"", ""I didn't mean it like that, i only wanted to get on her nerves"", ""I felt powerless and did it to feel something"", ""I was getting bored in our relationship/lives and i wanted to try something New WITH YOU"", ""it was just texting, nothing physical happend"", ""I didn't think it would be that big of a deal"".

So many excuses. And i am shattered. I love this man with everything that i have. I have carried him on my back for the past Months when he didn't have a job. And He just does that. 
I threw up, haven't eaten for almost two days now and can not cope. I don't know what to do. 

He told me, if i told anyone other than my therapist about this Situation, he would leave me. And that gets me so mad because i haven't decided what i want to do now. 
I feel betrayed and disrespected. He knew what he was doing was wrong and hurtful, otherwise he wouldn't have hidden it from me. He knew and He did not give a fuck. 

And now he is acting like the victim. Telling me how much effort he put in the last years. That i must not see his efforts for me to just ""throw everything away over a few texts"". 

I know that He is trying to manipulate me into staying and accepting. But i am right now just too weak to do anything. 
I am in therapy and was well on my way to burnout well before this Situation came to light. And now i can't do anything other than cry and lay in my bed and feel sick to my stomach. I am physically and emotionally so drained. 

I really need some advice.
Where do i go from here? I am so tired and so alone.

I've known my roommate for many years and we're good friends, but moving into an apartment with him two years ago has been difficult due to our difference in lifestyles. I consider myself fairly clean and organized, probably even slightly neurotically so, but my roommate exists completely in the radical other direction. 

The past year, I've been keeping a list of all the things that bother me and seeing it all laid out in my notes app has made me question just how acceptable this living situation is for two guys in their mid-20s. I've given him some grace on certain issues since he has chronic problems with being half-consciously active at night, but I don't know how much longer I can take the onslaught of problematic habits.

I will say there were other issues that I've had written down but then brought up and have since been fixed, and so those have been 86'd from the list. The following issues, however, have each been brought up at least once with little to no improvement since.

Here's the list in full:

* Frequent body odor
* Unsavory smell from bedroom
* Leaving spills/smears/crumbs uncleaned
* Neglecting to take care to avoid spills/smears/crumbs
* Letting food sit in dishes in the sink without rinsing
* Spilling food into the sink and leaving it there
* Leaving shoes and guitar cases in the walkway
* Stomping heavily at nighttime hours
* Slamming doors (bedroom, bathroom, cabinet, refrigerator) at nighttime hours
* Speaking/laughing loudly at nighttime hours whether in conversation with me, with himself, or with the cat
* Burping loudly directly outside my door at night while stomping into the bathroom then loudly closing the bathroom door then stomping back to his room then loudly closing the bedroom door (bathroom is located directly next to my bedroom)
* Leaving the shower faucet dripping after shower
* Leaving the bathroom floor and rug soaking wet after shower
* Collecting used disposables in common areas e.g. razors, toothpaste tubes, coffee cups, toothbrushes, peanut butter jars, mayonnaise jars, etc.
* Leaving little wrappers or pieces of trash on the floor or on surfaces
* Leaving food containers partially or fully open in fridge or cabinet
* Leaving wet laundry in the washing machine for hours causing it to develop moldy smell then leaving it in the dryer for days at a time for me to discover the smell when I'm forced to remove it to do my own laundry
* Setting things precariously on the edge of the top of the fridge so that they fall when the freezer is opened
* Leaving the sink dirty after doing dishes
* Leaving the sponge sopping wet and dirty on the dirty sink bottom
* Neglecting to do the dishes for several days at a time
* Removing guitar picks from common areas and collecting them in his room
* Leaving items (guitars, vinyl records, shoes, blankets, etc.) out and in the way instead of putting them back where they're supposed to go
* Touching doors, drawers, handles, and instruments with greasy/dirty hands
* Neglecting to take care of instruments by avoiding collisions or precarious placement
* Leaving my PS4 on after using it

  
Yup, think that's everything. I usually bring up an issue or two when there's a particularly egregious offense or if I'm feeling particularly irritated by it, and he usually says ok and tells me he'll do it, but obviously the habit eventually continues. Most of the stuff I've mentioned has only been brought up once or twice, though. I'm trying to be sensitive to his feelings and not come across as insulting.

Pros: no feeding, patients are usually asleep, no family.
Cons: I've had up to 30 patients, I'm am sooooo tired, people can be a little irritated but I would be too if I got woken up in the middle of the night.
11 pm I usually clock in and get report from the previous shift, I get shown my assignment, today was fairly light only 14 patients and for noc that's pretty good, NGL I'm a little embarrassed to say I'm a slow CNA at least compared to some people that feel like they are speed running their job. It takes me a long time to do vitals because I take my time to introduce myself and not rush anything and I'll get interrupted 9/10 times while doing vitals with a task or call light also doing vitals gives me a chance to see if everyone is clean and comfortable. Around 1 am there is down time to do some charting, 2 am I check up on patients, repositioning, emptying catheter bags, and making sure everyone is clean, I also do some light cleaning, around 3am I get some more charting done, low-key I dislike charting, then I take my 30 minute lunch, today lunch is cold pizza and a lot of coffee. Between 4 and 4:30 there is some down time but that is the calm before the storm, I use this time to mentally prepare and drink more coffee. 4:30 hits and now it's go time. I change everyone before am shift comes including those who have been already changed in the night and those who insist they are clean cuz miss ma'am I understand you are clean but you been wearing that brief all night, also half the time they aren't actually clean they just didn't know they needed to be changed. It literally takes me 10-15 and at max 20 minutes per patient, I still feel slow compared to others but I heard 10-15 minutes isn't bad. 20 minutes is when I have to change the bedsheets and clothes as well. And finally 7 am hits and I have not stopped changing briefs since 4:30. And now I have to chart like my life depends on it because I have 30 minutes until am shift comes. All in all I get it done, I'm tired, drained, and I want to sleep. But overall what I described was a really successful shift for me! Sometimes things go south and you have to be quick on your feet!

It was purely casual at the beginning (more enforced on my end since I wasn't ready for anything serious, although I'm pretty certain she would've said yes to a relationship) and we only saw each other once a month, to prevent either of us from developing too much feelings for one another, and also gives each other time to go out on dates with other people and explore (since we were both in our early-mid 20s and shouldn't just settle for one another so soon). I was also her first, since she was a virgin when I met her, so I didn't want to pin her down and prevent her from truly exploring her life.

Inevitably, we ended up seeing each other once a week and acted more like a couple and feelings grew for both of us. Whilst I absolutely adore and love her who she is a person, I believe our lifestyles to be very different along with a few other dealbreakers that have always prevented me from seeing her as a true romantic partner. It's a sad reality, but these are just my true feelings. I've tried brute-forcing romantic feelings for her and attempted to try something more exclusive/relationship-like, but I simply couldn't do it, no matter how great the physical intimacy was between us.

With that all said and done, now fast forward to present day 2025, we haven't seen each other in months as I simply could not give her what she wanted - which is ultimately a relationship. We decided to call it quits whilst she pursues something more concrete, which I totally respect. I still hold lots of love for her as a true friend, and I would very much like to keep in contact with her even as friends, but a part of me understands that it might simply be impossible. We are so physically attracted to one another, we basically jump on each other whenever we are together, I believe the physical chemistry and intimacy is too high for us to ever just be ""friends"" at a true platonic level. But god I just miss our conversations and I really want to reach out, even if it is just for a coffee. But a part of me believes that she won't be able to truly move on if I'm still in the picture. And if she does find herself a boyfriend, it would be inappropriate for us to be talking anyway. Are situationships just all doomed to end as strangers?

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements



Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)



Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:



Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep



Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness



Want better exercise performance and recovery



Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally



Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements



However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.



Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.



I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.



Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.



Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.



⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ 5/5 – A Life-Changing Supplement That Works.",1,1748170805.0,FighttoSurviveTVShow,2,1.0,False
1kuzv9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianMasculinity/comments/1kuzv9l/nobody_ever_talks_aboutdating_logistics/,Nobody ever talks about...dating logistics,"Yep, I said it.

Basically there is a lot of advice about looks or profile review but not much about text game, dating set up, logistics and hold to hold the relationship once things get going along.

Why do I say this: you normally gravitate towards people whom are confident in themselves, and take the lead.

Leadership shows confidence. Your know how gives comfort to others.

Let's give an example, your text game goes well, keeping it fun and a bit flirty, enticing but not too long a response.

Generally I like to keep my messages a sentence or two long and not paragraph Wikipedia responses.

Example: 
""Hey {name}, did you actually order what you wanted from the menu or are you still looking?""

Her: ""haha, yea I got the cheesecake in the end""

Me: ""oh next time, try me n you, I like cheesecake""

Blahblah (this is just an example, it's cheesy but let's say hypothetically it works, how to set up the date?)

Yes, the date. You pick a spot where it's generally not super busy or super empty. And of course not some run downs spot that does not have any ounce of romantic feel.

I repeat, *romantic*. This is the main thing, no matter the cost. If you set the mood up, it shows you care and have thought about the date.

Generally some good spots to date are: nice cosy coffee shops, cafes with food, dessert places or if you can afford, a bit more upscaled restaurants (however I tend to stick with cafes or ok restaurants that don't break the bank)

Why is this important? You don't wanna splash out the dough on someone you barely know, the date is to know them. All things considered, you do not pedestal the person. They're supposed to be your equal no matter how pretty they are etc. no need to treat them as a prize as if you aren't also a prize. You're both human.

Generally, after the first activity (in this case, cafe) you follow up with a brisk walk afterwards which could lead to the date extending OR you can offer to just walk to the station and go home if all doesn't go well.

Either way, whether if the date is good or not, you can leave things to the 2nd date of you like them.

Dating can be tricky, and if you have a few in the span of a week/month, you may need to fix your logistics aka don't take all the dates to the exact same spot in a short span of time so that the staff end up recognising you OR worse a previous date will bump into you. 

Hence, you probably don't want to hit the same spot twice in a month or so. 

Next, let's say all goes well, and you get into an rship:
Someone's true colours do not show until a good few months (I take the honeymoon period post 3 months)
If all goes well then great, if not, and it's more than it's worth, you gotta be honest with yourself.

An rship is all about communication, commitment and if you can see a future with that person. Do not waste each others time if that's the case.

Good luck bros 💪

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.



After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.



What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.



That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.



What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:



Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.



PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).



N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.



Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.



Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.



Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.



In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.



My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.



Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.



Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""



Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.



The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.



Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.



Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.



Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.



Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""



Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:



Clean, research-based ingredient list



No stimulants, no crash



Noticeable improvements after consistent use



Supports both mind and body



Manufactured with high quality standards



Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens



Cons:



Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)



Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.



My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.



✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!



Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.



I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”



The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.



By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.



Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.



Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.



Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.



Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.



Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.



Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:



✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.



✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.



✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!



✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.



✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.



Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:



Bloating or gas



Irregular bowel movements



Leaky gut or food intolerances



Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings



Skin issues like acne or rashes



Weakened immunity



Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...



Then this product is 100% for you.



Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.



Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.



Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.



I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

Think this was the first time in ages I felt a connection with a girl (f27) so quick and conversations were deep about our pasts and personal troubles and also top level as well. We aligned on similar upbringing, political values, humour, music etc. I was trying to match her were she was at (as in she was the one to go deep convo first) as I could tell she didn't want to rush into anything physical too quick as I was her 1st in person date in over a year. When we kissed she said ""that's big"" to which I asked why and she said it had also been a year since being kiss.

She called it off 2 days after the 2nd date (we already had plans for a 3rd date the next week) after she was texting me stuff like how ""she smiles everything she thinks about me"" and how she really enioy my company. She said that dating to her is an outer body experience and that she's not ready to date still. She said we could meet for coffee at friends which I declined at the time and we left it at that after texting for 2 hours about the break off. Saying how I deserve more than she can give, that she felt seen and understood, acknowledged thst she normally doesn't get this connected from a few dates but ultimately can't date me. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks later I decided to reach out saying I'm open for the coffee just to catch up and instead of a yes or a decline I've just been ghosted. It just makes me feel what I felt and what I perceived of her liking me was all in my head. Obviously I now regret reaching out and definitely should have left it with my head held high as I was doing alright until deprecating my self value.

Throughout my life, I’ve only ever talked closely with one or two people at a time. These people have changed during different periods of my life, but my social circle has always been limited to just one or two person. For example, right now I have one friend I see once every few months and a boyfriend.

In school, I used to interact with different people, but after graduation, all the connections suddenly ended. I tried reaching out to some of them occasionally, asking to grab a coffee or something, but maintaining a friendship turned out to be really difficult—for me and for them.

During university, I had a group of acquaintances for a few months, but after moving to another city, all those connections faded away too.

To be honest, I wouldn’t even call those interactions close friendships—more like just casual acquaintances.

So now I’m 21. I work remotely and I’m not studying anywhere at the moment. That makes it really hard to meet new people. And the old ones have stopped keeping in touch because of distance and time. I even signed up for a dance class hoping to find some kind of connection there, but our relationships are quite distant and cold as well.

I’m sharing all this just to explain that I’ve never really had deep friendships in my life, even though I try to keep in touch and not come across as clingy or annoying. But when I scroll through social media, I see people I know hanging out with their friends, going on trips together, enjoying life—and I realize I don’t even have anyone to go on a short trip with, or grab a coffee and walk in the park.

So my question is: is this somehow my fault? Am I unconsciously pushing people away? Or is it just the people and circumstances I’ve encountered? Also, I’d be really grateful for any advice on how to improve this situation.",1,1748170130.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1kuznvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1kuznvk/amazing_meal_and_experience_in_pooraka/,Amazing meal and experience in Pooraka,"Like the title says, my family and I had an amazing meal in Pooraka yesterday. It was at a little delicatessen in a group of shops on Research Road. All it says out the front is literally 'Minimart' with some ads for European-looking products like chocolates and coffee on the front window. Inside is an area with a few tables, a wall that with a small menu of savoury and sweet options (written in both English and a slavic language) as well as a tv that was playing Eastern European pop music. 


We didn't really intend to get lunch there, we were in the area because my wife had heard about a 2nd hand toys market (Terra Collective) and we were really just curious to see what else was in the area. The first thing we noticed was how lovely the lady was at the front till. We had just come in to browse and when I asked what country the products were from, she was happy to explain that her family were Serbian but the store stocked products from all the countries the area that used to be Yugoslavia. When we finished browsing she actually asked if it was okay for our daughter to have a chocolate and gave her a brand neither of us had seen before. 


After we finished looking at the shops nearby we decided to go back to the Minimart for lunch. As we aren't very familiar with Eastern European food we didn't exactly know what we were ordering. There were two main options, sausages  (chevapchichi) with lepinja or a beef patty, also with lepinja. You can get optional sides including cream cheese, cabbage salad and vegetable relish. There are also sweet options that sound great but in the end we went with a half serve of chevapachichi (5 sausages and meat patty with cream cheese and cabbage salad. My wife and daughter had an Orangina each and I ordered a short black. The meal was brought out by a really lovely older woman and it turned out that Lepinja is like a hamburger roll, a really nice, chewy bread. The meat patty was huge, wide and flat. It sat on a bed of melted cream cheese. Simple but totally delicious. The sausages were super tasty too and the cabbage salad was really light, tangy and refreshing. It definitely helped offset the heaviness of the meat and cheese. My coffee came out mid-meal, they offer other types of coffee but I ordered the short black hoping it was similar to a greek coffee and I was glad to be correct. The coffee came in a carafe served on on a tray with packets of sugar and a small cup. It was really thick, strong and again, delicious. Definitely recommend. 


Overall I thought the experience was awesome. The food was great but perhaps just important was how lovely the staff were. The lady at the front counter was so kind and helpful and seemed really excited to show us a bit of her country's culture. The store also reminded me a bit of the OG corner stores that used to be more common before they were swallowed up by petrol stations and supermarket giants. Maybe they didn't have everything we needed but they genuinely were part of the community. It's nice to know that those stores still exist. 

Anyway I'd definitely recommend Minimart on Research Road in Pooraka. The proper address is shop 4, 16-28 Research Road, Pooraka. I think they're only open, Thursday, Friday and Saturday but this is a business I'd happily support.",63,1748169973.0,Adelaide,12,0.98,False

BLUF: Moreish, but not exceptional.

This was a limited release with just 7,200 bottles worldwide. I picked it up as a bargain at auction a few months ago.

Aged for nine years in ex-bourbon barrels and finished for twelve months in Caribbean rum barrels, I expected something quite ‘expressive’. Was a little disappointed with a whisky of medium weight that was still young and feisty, without many of the notes I would expect from a rum cask.

Integrity Bottling?: Yes. 46% abv, non-chill filtered, no added colour.

Colour: Aged Sauternes

Nose: Mocha, salted caramel, charred pineapple, some coconut, lychee and mango.

Palate: Coffee and Caramel have disappeared. We are talking milk chocolate and coconut (Bounty Bars?), a little sweet citrus like mandarine, vanilla and a light oakiness. Some sweet honey notes.

Finish: Only medium length, sweet, dried apricots, honeyed malt, some dark chocolate, a little white pepper, some green/fermented banana that may be the rum finish finally coming through.

Overall Impression: A little ‘young’ and spirit driven. Would have benefited from some more time resting in the rum barrel as it was more reminiscent of a slightly over-sweetened bourbon aged Scotch.

Rating: Yet to work out a definitive scoring system. Suffice to say it was enjoyable, but I would only buy it again if I got it cheap (which this bottle was).

1kuzgdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/1kuzgdd/my_mum_is_emotionally_abusive_advice_needed/,My mum is emotionally abusive - advice needed,"(Not sure what tag to put, sorry - I think this is most pertinent?)

My mum has been emotionally, psychologically, and occasionally physically abusive my whole life. 

  
She is constantly angry, always swearing, insulting, belittling and mocking us (my dad, sister, and I). We have had the police called on us multiple times for reports of a domestic, sometimes reports so bad that three police cars show up, and on such occasions she lies to the police officers claiming that my dad attacked her. I have one vivid memory of being maybe 9/10 and sitting on the lower bunk of mine and my sister's bunk bed with my dad and the two dogs and sobbing to the police, while we could hear her crying to the police that my dad attacked her and was a danger - and the police responding that they could tell we felt safer with our dad. 

  
My dad is genuinely the best man ever, he is so patient, sweet, kind, and caring. All the chores in the house are delagated to him, he cleans, does the washing up, prepares the food, looks after the dogs, and while I try and help him as much as I can he always tells me that I'm the kid and I need to be out having fun rather than doing chores. He does basically everything for my mother, and makes her a coffee every single morning. I remember one time he didn't have it ready for her and she started swearing at him, calling him a lazy bastard who never did anything etc. 

My dad definitely recieves the worst abuse; she is always calling him horrible names (her new favourite is ""you motherfucker, you fucked your mother didn't you and that's why you turned out like this""). 

He has also *genuinely* never said a bad word about her to my sister or I (although I'm sure he thinks things).

She has told me to kill myself before, told me she wanted to stab my eyes out, told me graphic details about how I would be anally raped if I went outside without a coat on when I was 11, is always calling me lazy and fat, and yet she seems to think she is absolutely the best person on the earth. 

I used to have panic attacks all the time - just hearing her yell in another room would cause me to start shaking and my heart to start pounding. I remember that up until the age of maybe 6 (?) my sister and I would sprint to hide whenever we heard her footsteps coming, and I genuinely will never forget the first time I didn't run to hide and how my heart was pounding and I was so scared and literally every instinct inside of me was telling me to run. 

I feel worst for my dad, who (as I said before) recieves the worst of the abuse. As I am now 18 and moving out to university in a few months I have started telling my dad that he needs to divorce her, but they run a business together and I don't think he could be financially independent on his own. I want to help him so bad but I don't know what to do. I just want everyone in my mum's life who doesn't know what she's like to us to learn about how genuinely evil she is (I have been taking voice recordings in the hope that one day I'll be able to take her to court and get her punished - just a weak fantasy of mine that helps me get through the emotional abuse and gives me something purposeful to do when she's screaming). 

I just need advice on how to help myself, my sister, and most importantly my dad.

Here's the twist: I tie it to the new habit I'm trying to form. So, each time I fail, I write why I'm grateful for attempting it, even if I messed up. Like, ""I'm grateful I tried to meditate today because it showed me I can find 5 minutes for myself,"" even if I didn't actually chill long enough or got distracted.

A week later I open my door in the early morning to get coffee for my gf, and there’s this old shopping cart left there that they obviously brought back from the store. At first didn’t say anything. Then they started leaving old food in it and empty chip cans and shit. Some time after that during that summer we get woken up by these loud bangs and crashes coming from upstairs. Come to find out they were dancing upstairs almost like a traditional thing they do but it’s fucked up because they are obnoxiously loud at all times of night. Started at 10 didn’t stop at all till like 1 or 2am. Then they are back up in like an hour or so (guessing the adults stay up a while) Horrible when you have to work early.

I don’t normally write reviews, especially not long ones, but I feel morally obligated to share my experience because this product has truly changed my life.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://603dep05g7pb5z6kxbn-k2-6f4.hop.clickbank.net)

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

My Struggle: Years of Digestive Chaos

Let me back up a little. For years, I battled unpredictable digestion. Some days I’d be so bloated it looked like I was six months pregnant. Other days, I couldn’t go to the bathroom for two or three days in a row. I also had frequent acid reflux, gurgling sounds, random stomach pains, and just a constant feeling of discomfort.

[**✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://603dep05g7pb5z6kxbn-k2-6f4.hop.clickbank.net)

Doctors told me it was “just IBS” or “stress-related.” I tried everything: prescription meds, over-the-counter antacids, low-FODMAP diets, expensive food sensitivity tests, juicing, fasting—you name it. Nothing gave me long-lasting relief. And worst of all, my energy was constantly drained. I was irritable, sluggish, and frankly, depressed. My gut issues had taken over my life.

I stumbled upon PrimeBiome during one of my 2 a.m. desperate Google searches. At first, I was skeptical. But after reading about the spore-based probiotics and how they survive stomach acid (unlike 90% of the regular probiotics that die before reaching your gut), I figured: “What do I have to lose?”

The First Few Days: A Surprising Start

When PrimeBiome arrived, I appreciated the clean, professional packaging. It felt like a premium product right from the unboxing. I started with one capsule a day, as recommended.

By day 3, I noticed something shocking—my stomach wasn’t making those embarrassing gurgling noises anymore. My digestion already felt a little smoother. And by the end of week 1, I had my first completely normal bowel movement in months. I’m talking no straining, no cramping, no bloating—just relief.

Week 2: Energy, Mood, and Skin? What’s Going On?

By the second week, I felt like a completely new person. I had more energy in the morning without needing three cups of coffee. My mind was clearer. I wasn’t crashing at 2 p.m. anymore. Even my mood improved—I felt lighter emotionally, less anxious, and more balanced.

Oh, and here’s something unexpected: my skin cleared up! I used to have these little breakouts on my cheeks and forehead. Gone. Just gone. Turns out, the gut and skin are deeply connected—and PrimeBiome was doing some serious deep cleaning from the inside out.

Week 4 and Beyond: The Gut I Was Born to Have

By the end of the first month, I realized something I hadn’t in years: I no longer worried about food. I could eat without fear of bloating, pain, or running to the bathroom. I felt free.

Even better? I started losing a few pounds of belly fat—without changing anything else in my routine. Why? Probably because inflammation was down, my body was digesting food properly, and I wasn’t holding on to toxic waste anymore.

Let me be clear: this isn’t some magical fat-loss pill. But when your gut is working correctly, everything else in your body begins to work better. And PrimeBiome was the missing link.

Why PrimeBiome Stands Out From the Rest

Here’s what makes this product a MUST-HAVE:

✅ Spore-Based Probiotics – These are the elite soldiers of the probiotic world. Unlike traditional probiotics, they survive the journey through your stomach acid and reach your gut where they can actually do their job.

✅ Clinically Proven Strains – These aren’t just random bacteria thrown into a capsule. Each strain is backed by science and chosen for its ability to repair gut lining, fight harmful bacteria, and rebalance your microbiome.

✅ No Refrigeration Needed – PrimeBiome uses a heat-stable formula, so it’s easy to take on-the-go and travel with. Convenience matters!

✅ Third-Party Tested – You can trust the label. There are no hidden fillers, no fake ingredients, and no shady practices. What you see is what you get.

✅ Real, Lasting Results – Most supplements promise the moon and deliver nothing. PrimeBiome is one of the only supplements that actually delivered visible, tangible, lasting changes in my health.

Who Should Use PrimeBiome?

If you suffer from:

Bloating or gas

Irregular bowel movements

Leaky gut or food intolerances

Fatigue, brain fog, or mood swings

Skin issues like acne or rashes

Weakened immunity

Or even just want a clean, healthy digestive reset...

Then this product is 100% for you.

Even if you “feel fine,” the truth is most people have an imbalanced gut microbiome without even knowing it. Between antibiotics, processed food, stress, and environmental toxins—we ALL need gut support. PrimeBiome is the simplest, most effective way to do that.

Final Verdict: I’ll Never Go Without It Again

I’m now on my fourth bottle of PrimeBiome, and I’ll never go without it again. I’ve recommended it to my husband, my sister, and even my skeptical best friend who had chronic constipation—she’s now a die-hard fan too.

Listen, I know what it feels like to be desperate for a solution. To waste hundreds of dollars on products that don’t work. But I can promise you this: PrimeBiome is different. It works. And if you’re even slightly on the fence, do yourself the favor and just try one bottle. You’ll know within a week or two that something is changing—and you’ll never want to go back.

I don’t say this lightly: PrimeBiome didn’t just help me poop better—it gave me back my health, my confidence, and my life. I am deeply grateful to the creators of this product. Thank you for changing my life.

In a world where everyone seems to be running low on energy, it's tough to find a supplement that actually works without relying on heavy stimulants.

That's why when I heard about Mitolyn, a mitochondrial support supplement, I was intrigued — but also skeptical. Lots of products promise the world and deliver little.

After trying Mitolyn consistently for 8 weeks, I’m honestly impressed.

This isn’t just another energy pill — it’s something different, and in this review, I’ll explain exactly what happened for me and why I think it’s worth considering.

What Makes Mitolyn Special?

Mitolyn focuses on something most supplements ignore: mitochondrial health.

Instead of just masking fatigue with caffeine, it supports your body’s ability to create real energy at the cellular level.

That difference matters.

When your mitochondria are healthy, everything improves — from your brain function to your workout performance to how fast you recover from stress.

What sets Mitolyn apart is the quality and synergy of its ingredients. Here's what’s inside:

Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10): Essential for cellular energy production and antioxidant protection.

PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone): Promotes the creation of new mitochondria (a rare benefit in supplements).

N-Acetyl L-Carnitine: Boosts mental clarity and physical energy.

Alpha Lipoic Acid (ALA): A powerful antioxidant that enhances mitochondrial function.

Resveratrol: Famous for supporting longevity and fighting oxidative stress.

Magnesium and B Vitamins: Vital cofactors for energy metabolism.

In other words, Mitolyn isn’t throwing random ingredients together — it’s built around a clear, science-backed strategy.

My First Month with Mitolyn: What I Noticed

When I first started taking Mitolyn, I made sure to keep the rest of my habits the same (no new workouts, no changes in diet) to really see what the supplement could do.

Week 1-2:

At first, I didn’t feel much difference. I knew real mitochondrial support would take time, so I stayed patient.

Week 3:

This is when I started noticing something exciting: I had a steady, natural energy throughout the day. Not a wired or hyper feeling, just a solid baseline of ""I can handle anything.""

Week 4:

By the end of the month, I realized I hadn’t been reaching for coffee in the afternoons anymore. Plus, my focus at work was sharper, and my workouts felt noticeably stronger.

Another bonus: my mood seemed more even. I didn't get frustrated as easily and felt more grounded overall.

The Real Benefits I Experienced

Consistent Energy: I’m no longer dragging myself through afternoons. My energy feels ""clean,"" not forced.

Enhanced Cognitive Performance: Tasks like writing, strategic planning, and learning new skills became easier. Less mental fatigue.

Better Workouts and Recovery: More stamina during cardio and faster recovery afterward.

Improved Stress Resilience: Life feels less overwhelming, even during busy weeks.

Subtle Anti-Aging Effects: I can't scientifically measure it, but I honestly feel younger — more vibrant and ""alive.""

Pros and Cons of Mitolyn

Pros:

Clean, research-based ingredient list

No stimulants, no crash

Noticeable improvements after consistent use

Supports both mind and body

Manufactured with high quality standards

Vegan, non-GMO, free of common allergens

Cons:

Takes a few weeks to fully notice effects (not instant)

Slightly higher price point than typical energy supplements

Only available online (not sold in physical stores easily)

Who Might Benefit from Mitolyn?

In my opinion, Mitolyn is a fantastic choice if you:

Feel chronically tired, even with enough sleep

Struggle with focus, memory, or mental sharpness

Want better exercise performance and recovery

Are interested in slowing the aging process naturally

Prefer science-backed, non-stimulant supplements

However, if you’re just looking for a quick caffeine buzz, Mitolyn probably isn’t for you.

This is a supplement for people who want deep, lasting improvements.

Is Mitolyn Worth the Money?

Short answer: Yes, absolutely — especially if you care about your long-term energy, brain health, and vitality.

I see Mitolyn as an investment. Instead of spending money every day on coffees, energy drinks, or ""band-aid"" supplements, I’m fueling my body to produce its own energy more efficiently.

Given the quality of ingredients, the careful formulation, and the results I've personally experienced, I think the value is definitely there.

Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Mitolyn?

Without hesitation, yes.

Mitolyn is now part of my daily health stack, and I plan to keep using it for the long term.

[**✅Visit The Mitolyn Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!**](https://2e4dfqzgq0l5exfewg26zg0kb2.hop.clickbank.net)

If you’re serious about feeling more energized, more focused, and more resilient, Mitolyn is absolutely worth a try.

Just give it time — think of it as building your foundation, not putting up a quick tent.
