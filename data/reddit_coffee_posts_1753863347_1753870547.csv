1md2rk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1md2rk4/you_havent_worked_here_for_over_five_years/,You haven't worked here for over five years...,"Dear me, it's been a while, hasn't it? Sorry to say that there haven't been any good Tales of late. Sure, there's been a few irregularities, some issues - yesterday we had no toner and only half the breakfast items. The weather has been fantastic, with *shockingly* mild springlike weather. 

Tonight, gentle readers, we shall speak of former employees, family, and people not being all there. Buttercup is in ber paddock enjoying a bit of crunchy oats at the moment, should anyone need to braid her mane and tail with the prettiest of ribbons.

So there I was, in the doldrums of the night, after the paperwork has been done, but hours before breakfast, when a woman walks in. Peeking at the cameras, she looks reasonably ""not-homeless"" enough that I don't worry when she goes over to the coffee.

That's when I notice the wagon.

Not one of those folding fabric ones, but an actual metal little red wagon. Piled with a few bags and blankets, stashed cleverly behind one of the portico's pillars, *almost* out of view of the cameras. Yes, it seems this woman is in fact one of the local unhoused population. 

I'm not fussed about the coffee too much, but I do follow her outside to make it clear she needs to move along. She's pulling her charging cable out of her bag, so it's pretty clear she was interested in hanging out in our lobby for a while.

I clear my throat, ""Hey there..."" Nice and nonconfrontational. I'm in a good mood.

""Are you new?"" This is said in the sneering, mocking tone of a Karen, which takes me aback a bit.

""I am not, no.""

""You *must* be new. Let me talk to a woman."" Something about her seems familiar, but I can't put my finger on it.

""There isn't anyone else here, sorry. Good night.""

I head back inside, but as I'm settling back in, I see that she's come into the lobby after me.

""DIANA?"" She shouts, in my lobby at two am.

""LYDIA?"" 

""Hey! I can't have you shouting in my lobby at two am.""

""Whatever... (slightly quieter) Sabrina? Natalie?""

""No no, that's it, you need to stop.""

""Ex*cuse* me, I'm *trying* to find my *family*. Becca?""

That's when it clicks. The names she's been shouting are those of some of our housekeeping staff, and some of them haven't been here in five years. *Now* I recognize her.

Most of our housekeeping staff are related. A bit of mild nepotism perhaps, but they were all generally good employees, and got along well. But all families have their black sheep, and this gal was theirs. 

She'd worked with us for a while, but the quality of her work went steadily downhill, as did her attitude and personal life. Her husband was unemployed, and she didn't want to work full-time. She managed to miss enough rent payments to get evicted, and wound up staying at the hotel for a while.

The manager had given her a generous rate, but even that wasn't enough. She'd mooched a few bucks off her family, generally burned bridges, and became demanding and awful.

Also drunk and loud.

So she got the boot. After a couple incidents where she convinced family members to let her sneak into vacant rooms, she got added to the DNR list. Stern words were had with the staff, and that was the last I had heard of it. There were a few more problems with her, but I'm on the night shift, so I miss a lot of the scuttlebutt around here. As far as I knew, she was gone for good. Until now.

""You need to leave, please.""

""I need to talk to my family!""

""They are not here. You need to leave.""

""I am *federal* and I am conducting an *investigation*!"" ... o-kay, that's an odd attempt at false authority? She's seeming less rational now.

""You need to leave, now.""

""I was *raped* and there were *bones*!"" Ahh, yeah, she's got something going on, brainwise. I'm no mental health expert though.

""You need to leave or I am calling the police.""

""Yeah, it's *good* there's no women here tonight. Really, *really* good..."" She grumbles her way out the door when I pick up the phone.

It sucks. She's probably not going to get help with the issues she's got going on. I hope she manages to recover, but it sounds like she's got some flavor of schizophrenia (reminder that I am *not* a mental healt expert) and that doesn't really get better on its own.

Take a moment to say good night to Buttercup, and may your night be free of unstable former employees.

Teal Deer; DNR'd former employee shows up, is not all there.

My bf made that pin in the picture provided, and when we got to Brodie he legit carried the kitty back to the pin area but it just ran back to us. We didn’t want them to get run over crossing Brodie so we carried them thinking hopefully it was there neighborhood but nope, just kept following us. 

My bf has a bunny and can’t have a cat right now, and I am literally at max capacity with rescue animals atm. This kitty most definitely seems like it has a home and I really want to return it to the owner. 

We just didn’t know what to do and didn’t want them to get run over on Brodie, so now they posted up in my empty, spare bedroom with food/water/bed/litter box for tonight.

Please if this is your kitty please DM (please provide proof of some kind so I know it’s forsure going to its rightful owner) and please consider putting a collar on them so people can tell they aren’t a stray and it’s easier for them to return them if this kinda situation happens. I’ll literally give you the $20 to get a collar and tag at petsmart (there’s a booth thing by the entrance at the Southpark Meadows one where you just buy the tag and use that to engrave your info)

I’m going out of town soon so I can’t keep them here for long, and don’t want to drop them off at a shelter if they are someone’s pet. ",1,1753870413.0,Austin,0,1.0,False

1md2q0u,https://i.redd.it/c7o9b5tukzff1.png,Bride of the Cursed Alpha,"Chapter 1

Auren POV



The morning air was cool as I hurried through the pack house, balancing a tray of breakfast plates. The faint smell of caramel and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the halls, but it did little to soothe the anxiety brewing in my chest. Today was my birthday—my eighteenth—the day I would smell my mate who would take me away from this cursed life. Life as an orphan omega in our pack was riddled with hardships and misery.



“Do you plan on making me wait all morning, Auren?” Maris’s sharp voice cut through my thoughts like a whip as I entered the dining room.



Maris was Alpha Bram’s betrothed. He was thirty-three years old and still unmated. Maris was twenty-seven and daughter of the Alpha of Iron Pine pack. They had met each other in the annual mating ball about a year ago.



“I’m sorry,” I mumbled, bowing my head. Her dark, carefully fashioned curls shimmered in the sunlight filtering through the wide windows of the dining hall, and her perfectly manicured nails tapped against the table impatiently. Everyone knew Maris would be the Luna soon. She carried herself like it, with a sharp tongue and a sharper glare.



She narrowed her eyes at the tray in my hands. “Where’s my almond latte? I specifically asked for it.”



“It’s coming, Maris—” I stopped myself, flinching. “I’ll get it right away.”



Her lips curved into a cruel sneer. “See that you do. I’d hate to have to speak to Bram about your incompetence.” I didn’t know why was it that she hated me so much. It was like she was always finding an excuse to punish me.



The other maids, already standing around the table, exchanged knowing looks. One of them, a tall brunette named Reya, a sycophant, shot me a glare. “Honestly, Auren, you should be more careful. Lady Maris has enough to deal with without you messing up her morning.”



“Right,” chimed in another maid, Hyra, her voice dripping with false sweetness. “She’s practically running this pack already. You should be grateful she even lets you serve her.”



I nodded, clutching the tray tighter to keep my hands from trembling. “Yes, of course.”



As I turned to leave, Maris’s voice stopped me in my tracks. “And don’t call me Maris like we’re equals. It’s Luna Maris to you.” Her words were laced with venom, and the maids chuckled. My cheeks burned, but I didn’t argue. She wasn't a Luna, but she liked others to call her Luna.



In the kitchen, I prepared the latte with trembling hands, still feeling hurt about how they all loved to humiliate me for no reason. And no one remembered my birthday. Usually everyone got a note from the Alpha wishing them Happy Birthday, but not me.



My reflection in the polished metal of the coffee pot caught my eye. A slim girl with wide, gray eyes stared back at me, her blonde hair pulled into a loose braid. My face looked paler than usual and my expression was weary. It was a known fact that we got our wolves at sixteen and smelled our mates as soon as we turned eighteen, but why didn’t I smell mine?



“It’s just another day,” I whispered to myself. “Keep your head down, and it’ll be fine.”



But it didn’t feel like just another day. The air felt charged. I allowed that little hope to bubble inside my chest.



After delivering the latte and enduring another round of scornful looks and remarks, I retreated to the laundry room to catch my breath. That’s when it hit me—a scent unlike anything I’d ever smelled before. Warm and earthy, like pine trees after a rainstorm, with a hint of musk. My pulse quickened. My heart thundered.



‘Mate.’



The words of my wolf, Siena, echoed in my mind, both thrilling and terrifying. The mouthwatering scent tugged at me, pulling me out of the laundry room and down the hall. My feet moved on their own, guided by an invisible thread. The scent made my chest tighten, pulling me as if it had wrapped around me. Down the quiet hallway, the smell grew stronger, drowning out everything else around me. It was so strong and intoxicating that I couldn’t think of anything else. All my wolf wanted was to coat herself in it, roll in it.



‘That’s our mate!’ Siena said enthusiastically. ‘Go fast. I want my mate.’



The scent grew stronger as I stepped outside onto the training grounds. Warriors trained in the morning light. My eyes scanned the crowd, searching for the source. And then I saw him.



Alpha Bram Thorne.



I couldn’t believe that the moon goddess had made Alpha Bram my mate. Shock mingled with awe. The world around me faded as irresistible desire rippled through me. A deep sense of completion overcame me, as if I’ve found a missing part of my soul.



He stood at the center of the field, towering over the others with graceful confidence. His dark hair was slightly tousled, and his sharp features were set in a look of concentration as he demonstrated a fighting move. The sunlight caught the sweat on his brow, making him seem almost otherworldly.



My breath hitched as our eyes met. Hope swelled in my chest when I saw recognition in his eyes. This was it. My mate. My Alpha. He was going to pull me out of my wretched life. Before I could stop myself, my feet carried me towards him.



I stared at him like he was my God. He was so beautiful and strong that every girl in the Crimson Howl pack had a crush on him. All I wanted was to reach him and fall into his arms as he wrapped them around me. ‘Mate,’ I whispered, my cheeks flushing.



But, why was he behaving so coldly? Didn’t he recognize me?



When I was only a few feet away, his expression shifted. His body stiffened, and his warm, amber eyes turned cold. The flicker of recognition in his gaze was quickly replaced by a harsh disappointment and anger. It cut deep and so I hesitated.



‘No, go to him!’ Siena urged. When I took a few more steps toward him, Maris came into my peripheral vision, heading straight to Alpha Bram.



“Alpha Bram!” she chirped excitedly, elbowing me roughly, nudging past me, making me stumble to the side.



He looked at her and beamed as if I wasn’t even there. He opened his arms for Maris who rushed to him and hugged him tightly. She tipped her head up and he pressed a kiss to her lips.



My heart sank. I stood frozen, unable to move. The warmth I’d felt moments ago evaporated, leaving an intense ache in its place. The weight of his horrible rejection settled over me. His betrayal felt like a knife was plunged in my chest and then twisted.



Siena howled inside me out of rage and jealousy. ‘No, he is our mate.’ She wanted to come out and tear Maris away from him, but I knew that she was a weak wolf. If she surfaced, Alpha Bram would kill her instantly.



For years, I’d dreamed of this moment—the day I’d find my mate, the one person destined to see me for who I truly was, who would love me, cherish me. But now, that dream lay shattered at my feet. Tears sprang in my eyes.



Alpha Bram glared at me, daring to come close. Maris also turned to look at me with narrowed eyes. Dread plummeted in my stomach. I was afraid that if I went nearer and declare that I was his mate, they would throw me in the dungeons. So I turned and walked away, my shoulders slumping with miserable rejection I hadn’t even heard spoken aloud. The scent of him lingered, bittersweet and unbearable. By the time I reached the pack house, tears blurred my vision.



I thought today might be different, that I could finally have someone to share it with. Instead, I was left with a heart full of despair. Weren't mates supposed to look after each other?



I hid inside the laundry room and started crying. Was there a way to get out of this pack? The idea of rejection was so painful. How would I serve him now?



I curled up on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees as tears streamed down my face. The ache in my chest felt unbearable. It was like a deep, raw wound that wouldn’t stop bleeding. I didn’t know what to do or who to go to for comfort.



Alpha Bram’s cold, distant stare replayed in my mind over and over. My mate. He didn’t even want to acknowledge me.



Suddenly, the door opened.



Chapter 2

Auren POV



Being an orphan had always been hard for me. According to our previous Alpha, who was Alpha Bram’s father, my parents died in a pack war. He was kind enough to give me shelter in his packhouse and even allowed education in a school for omegas. However, a few years later when he died and Bram became the Alpha, he pulled me out of the school, made me pack’s servant and gave me lowly jobs, clearing stating that if I had to stay in the pack, I had to earn my living. His lusty gaze would often linger on me, and I would shy away, afraid of his intentions. But then he would snap his gaze away from me as if he saw vermin.



I was born with a tattoo the size of a squash ball on my back. A golden moon shackled by dark thorn vines curving around it. The Shaman had kindly warned me that it was a mark of a curse and so I had to keep it hidden at all times, afraid that if anyone saw it, they would kill me.



Suddenly, the door opened, snapping me from my thoughts. I hurriedly wiped my tears, but it was too late. Maris stood in the doorway, her arms crossed and a smug smile playing on her lips and her face donned with a wicked expression.



“Well, well,” she said, stepping closer. “If it isn’t our little orphan, sniveling like a child.”



I didn’t respond, keeping my head down. My whole body trembled in fear even though Siena wanted to come out and attack Maris.



“I know what happened,” she said, her voice dripping with venom. “You think you’re special because Bram is your mate? Let me tell you something, Auren.” She crouched down, her face close to mine. “We knew it long back. But you’re nothing. You’ll always be nothing. Bram doesn’t want you. He’ll reject you soon enough, and when he does, you’ll wish you’d never set foot in this pack.”



I swallowed hard, trying to fight back the fresh wave of tears.



“If you tell anyone—anyone—about this,” she continued, her voice low and dangerous, “I’ll make sure you regret it. Do you understand?”



I nodded weakly, too scared to speak. Maris straightened, brushing invisible dust off her skirt.



“Good. Now clean yourself up. You’re pathetic. I don’t want anyone to see you crying because if they do, they will ask you the reason. I swear you’ll regret it if they come to know the reason.” Saying that, she turned sharply, flicking her hair and marched out.



The weight of her words crushed me further. I brought my knees against my chest and hugged them tightly. Mates were supposed to take care of each other. His betrayal was worse than all my years of enduring servitude. And they knew that I was his mate? The revelation shocked me.



When I finally stepped out of the laundry room, the humiliation didn’t end. Reya was waiting for me in the kitchen. “You are reassigned to work in the toilets!” she barked at me. “Stay there until you get a new duty. Don’t you come out of that place!”



I balked as I stared at her. “What?” Toilets were the worst place to work.



She slapped me hard across my cheek. I screamed in pain as I fell down. Her lips curled into a sneer. “Did you not listen to what I said? Clean all the toilets. Now!”



Scared, I made my way to the toilets, sure that this was Maris’s order.



Over the next few days, Maris, always clever with her schemes, pointed fingers at me for things I hadn’t done. A broken vase, a spilled drink, and suddenly, I was everyone’s scapegoat. The other pack members whispered and sneered, their remarks cutting me like knives. They would accuse me of everything and anything. And Alpha Bram just turned a blind eye to all the bullying.



Things settled a bit, but one morning when I woke up and hurried to the kitchen, I heard Reya shouting at others. When I entered, Reya threw very expensive cutlery directly on the floor near me.



Maris walked in just at that time like she was waiting for this moment, as if on cue. “Reya, don’t let her get away with that,” she said, her tone filled with anger. “She’s nothing but trouble.”



It didn’t take much for Reya to agree. She and Maris cornered me by the pantry, their faces contorted in anger. I sensed something was wrong, but I had no time to react.



“You’ve caused enough problems,” Reya sneered immediately. “It’s time you learn a lesson.” And then came the blows. “No,” I cried and screamed and begged them to leave me, but no one came to rescue me.



“What’s going on?” A loud growl came. It was Alpha Bram, my mate. Was he coming to save me?



“Alpha Bram,” Maris immediately changed her facial expression and said in a honeyed voice. “Auren threw broken glass at me. See, I am bleeding.” She showed him a little cut on her finger that she got while beating me.



“No, it’s not–”



“How dare you?” Alpha Bram cut me off and roared in anger. “Throw her in the dungeons!” he ordered.



I was stunned. It was me, his mate, who was bleeding, and he didn’t even have a heart to respond to that. How naive of me to think of his coming to save me. This was just a perfect plan for them to get rid of me. And just like that, Maris and Reya dragged me to the dungeons—a dark, damp hole beneath the pack house where air was thick and musty, and the only light was coming from a single flickering torch.



“You’ll stay here until we decide you’ve learned your place,” Maris said, her voice laced with poison. She gave me one last triumphant smile before slamming the door shut. “Fucking bitch.”



Seven days passed in darkness. My body ached from the cold stone floor, and hunger clawed at my stomach. The only company I had was my wolf, Siena, who tried to comfort me, though her own pain mirrored mine.



But on the seventh day, the door opened. Reya stood there with her usual scorn.



“Get up,” she said sharply. “Alpha Bram has called for you.”



I staggered to my feet, weak and disoriented. Surprise flickered through me. Did he finally want me? But her next words were like some had splashed icy cold water on me.



“He’s going to offer you to Alpha Lucien. You know what that means, don’t you? His bride will never last. You’ll be dead within a year.” She gave me a sly smile.



My heart dropped to my stomach. “What?” I said in a weak voice. “He can't do that. I— I—” It was worse than being in the dungeons. Everyone knew about Alpha Lucien. He was cursed, just like every Alpha in his family, and so ruthless that he killed first and talked later.



“Shut up!” Reya shouted. When I scrambled back, she came over, pulled me roughly and dragged me out of the dungeon. “You dimwit,” she retorted. “Did you really think you could ever compete with Lady Maris? Now look how nicely she has got rid of you by convincing Alpha Bram. No one wants to marry Alpha Lucien. By offering you to him, she will win his alliance for Alpha Bram. And you? You’ll be nothing more than a breeder for the cursed Alpha. So it’s a neat little arrangement that benefits both packs beautifully.”



Chapter 3

Auren POV



As Reya dragged me out of the dungeons, my heart drummed against my ribcage out of pure fear. I couldn’t even think of marrying Alpha Lucien, not just because he was cursed, but also because Alpha Bram was my mate. The idea was abhorrent. It was better to die than to marry Alpha Lucien.



Summoning up whatever little energy I had left in me, I pulled my hand out of Reya’s and thought of running towards the forest that surrounded our pack. Once I got away from here, I was sure I would find help.



But the truth was cruel. I stood up, and the next second, my legs felt weak and my body collapsed. With a loud “bump”, I fell to the ground, so did my hope. The dust stung my lungs, my tears welling up in an instant. “No–” I struggled.



“Ha, you think you can escape?” Reya caught my neck with great force, turning my face to her. I couldn’t see her face clearly, but I assumed an evil smile there. “Get her.” She ordered before throwing me to the ground.



Two warriors jumped right in front of me. My eyes widened in horror. “Please leave me alone!” I begged them. “Let me live.”



As if my words irritated her, Reya came into my line of vision again. She directly charged at me and tackled me to the ground. She punched my side and I heard a crack. It meant that one of my ribs had fractured. A scream ripped out of my throat as my body turned numb in pain. “Live? You are so pathetic. Pick her up!” she ordered the warriors. One of them hauled me over his shoulder with no mercy to my fractured rib. As I screamed and cried and begged them to leave me, they carried me all the way to a little room in the omegas’ quarters and slammed the door shut behind them.



I pounded on the door, shouting, coughing blood. “Please leave me. Please.” But no one listened. Eventually, I slipped down on the floor with blood-stained clothes.



I don’t know how many hours went by when I heard the door creak open. I lifted my head only to see the pack's healer. “Luna Maris has sent me to you. Drink this draft,” he ordered. “It will reduce your pain.”



“C—can I talk to her?” I asked.



He clenched his jaw and without replying to me, forced me to have the draft and left, locking the door behind him.



I felt so weak and helpless that I sat against the wall as fresh tears sprang from my eyes. “This is not justified, goddess,” I said aloud. “It is not my fault that you bestowed Alpha Bram as my mate.” Alpha Lucien was the most ruthless Alpha in the north. “What have you written for me in this life?”



The door opened again and this time Alpha Bram walked in. He narrowed his eyes at me and scrunched his face. Shaking his head, he said, “How could the moon goddess bestow you as my mate? There must have been some mistake. You are so pathetic!”



With my eyes wide open, I stared at him with rage simmering in my chest. Feeling horrible under his gaze, I retorted, “I am not pathetic. You are pathetic! You are rejecting your moon-mate.”



He let out a growl and in a flash of a second, he grabbed my throat with his large hands. “Auren!” he shouted. “How dare you say that to your Alpha? You had the guts to run away and defy my orders.”



I started sputtering and coughing as he squeezed my airway.



“Bram!” Maris entered the room and shouted at him. “Don’t do that. Tomorrow she is going forever!”



Alpha Bram shoved me away and got up, still growling. And then came out the poisoned words,



“I, Alpha Bram Reed of the Crimson Howl Pack, reject you, Auren Cressida as my mate.”



“Noooo!” I shrieked as sharp pain stabbed my stomach and heart. My vision blurred and I doubled over, unable to move. Through my blurry vision, I saw Alpha Bram and Maris glaring at me coldly. Maris smirked and holding his hand, she walked out of the room, locking the door behind me.



“I will send Reya to dress her up tomorrow,” I heard her voice before I fainted.



When I woke up next, I felt numbness in my body. Seina had howled and whimpered all night and eventually rolled up in a ball and tucked away somewhere, where I couldn’t reach her. She was more hurt than I was.



Morning light was filtering in my room. It was a morning of doom. I didn’t have the strength to get up and do anything. I had lost my appetite. When the door opened again, I saw Reya entering with a box in her hand, followed by a maid.



She chuckled. “What a wretched bitch!” She pulled me up roughly. “Luna Maris has sent me to dress you up. But first you need a bath. You stink like a rotten critter.”



She dragged me to the bathroom where she opened a cold water shower. I shivered under it uncontrollably, but she was least bothered. When I came out, she threw a dress at me. “Wear this. Alpha Lucien will be here in an hour.”



I gaped at her with horror. Alpha Lucien was coming so fast?



The dress loosely hung over my shoulders. From the smell of it, I knew it was Maris’s old one.



Reya’s face lit up with a shrewd grin. “Congratulations, Auren. You are getting married to the most unwanted Alpha in the north. Consider yourself lucky that you will live another year while serving as his breeder.”



Chills ran down my body at the way she said it to me, and my knees felt wobbly. I walked shakily behind her until I reached the main hall.



The place was buzzing with activity. All the omegas were preparing for Alpha Lucien’s arrival. Maris was giving orders to them and as soon as she saw me, she sniggered. She jerked her chin to Reya who nodded and took me to a corner of the room. My eyes went to Alpha Bram who was talking to some people. Why was it that the rejection affected me and not him? Did his wolf not feel the pain? Tears came into my eyes again, but this time I refused to let them out because I didn’t want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me broken and shattered.



A few minutes later, he went out and when he returned, he was with Alpha Lucien. The most terrifyingly beautiful wolf I’d ever seen.



Towering at over six feet, his broad shoulders and chiseled physique radiated raw power. Midnight-black hair framed a cold, sharp, angular face, with dark eyes that seemed to pierce your soul. There were tattoos of vines and thorns on his muscular arms. His presence was magnetic yet menacing, like that of a silent, dangerous predator cloaked in charm.



When our gazes locked, I gasped and my cheeks heated.



Chapter 4

Lucien POV



The council chamber of the Shadowfang Pack was stifling, filled with the heavy presence of my pack’s Elders. They had serious expression, their faces weathered with age and experience and their eyes carrying the weight of centuries of tradition. I stood before them, my arms crossed, my jaw tight as they droned on about duty and heirs.



“You cannot keep delaying this, Lucien,” Elder Orlan said in a sharp voice. “The pack needs an heir. Without one, we risk losing everything we’ve built.”



I clenched my fists, the sharp points of my claws pressing into my palms. “And what happens to the woman you force me to marry?” My voice was cold, laced with a simmering anger I couldn’t contain. “She will die, just like the others who died marrying my ancestors.” I really wanted to put an end to this.



Elder Ryna, the oldest among them, leaned forward, her pale gray eyes penetrating. “We know the cost of the curse. But the survival of the Shadowfang pack must come first. Your power keeps us strong, but strength alone will not secure our future.”



Their words were like iron chains around me, dragging me back to the nightmare I lived every day. The curse—a cruel legacy of my bloodline—had claimed every bride my forefathers had taken. On the night of the full moon after our bond was sealed, death would come for them, slowly, silent and final. Within a year they all died. How many women will die just to carry my bloodline?



It was said that centuries ago, the moon goddess cursed our Alpha bloodline for betraying love or breaking a sacred bond. Rejections happened all the time, but I don’t know why did the goddess curse my forefather? What was special about that mate bond?

1md2pei,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1md2pei,"AliExpress is actually great! (Buying, and Refund experience)","So I'm constantly seeing negative stories posted about AliExpress on here, so much if I wonder whether eBay, Amazon, and Temu are doing it intentionally (astroturfing I think it's called?) to put people off buying, since honestly 95% of things on eBay/Amazon are actually being shipped from AliExpress and once people finally figure this out, ebay will be cactus. 

My... 7-8 years or so, shopping there have been overwhelmingly good. Maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe it's how/what I buy. 

I shop there ALOT. As proof, I've screenshotted everything I've bought in 2025 - see attached.  
That's about 200 items. Ranging from $10 things, to $350 tablets, $500 mobile phones, etc. I run a youtube where I need to buy lots of things for reviews and stuff, and that often pays for the purchases, which is why I can do this.

I very rarely need to refund items, for several reasons I'll explain below.

But I did have a refund just now for an $80  item. Here's how it went.  
1. Applied for refund on 25th  
2. Within 1 hour got a free return label  
3. Dropped off at Post Office today (30th)  
4. Within 1 hour got the refund as a bonus to my AliExpress account.

That's it. Simple. I didn't even need to post photos or videos or anything, but depending on the reason you might.

These are my tips for buying things.

1. Always buy **CHOICE**. I don't every time, but 90% of the time as it's fastest (5-10 days) and great return policy.

2. If you're buying something ridiculously cheap, don't whine when it turns out to be a ridiculously cheap piece of garbage that is either crap, or doesn't last long. You took the gamble. You knew what you were buying. Sometimes these things turn out great, sometimes not. AliExpress is just a platform, you're buying from a seller and making a choice as an adult to buy that $5 coffee machine or whatever.

3. If it looks TOO cheap, ridiculously cheap, check the seller's account (hover over it). If the store was established recently (this year) then DON'T BUY, that's a scam account. These are ""rare"" but sometimes there will be bursts and you'll see many. Look at other things they are selling. Are they ALL ridiculously cheap? $500 items for $50? DON'T BUY. These scam accounts get booted by AliExpress within a few weeks  once the feedback comes in. Same happens on eBay.

That's it really. And to be completely honest, I used to be HUGELY against AliExpress - around 10-15 years ago?  They've changed massively since then, and now I'm possibly their biggest fan. Are they perfect? Heck no, nothing is, but for me they're easily the best online shopping platform.

Part 1: New Visitors.


Chapter 1, Somewhere Only We Know


Tommy was bored—really bored. Three whole months of guarding a portal no one used anymore, but his boss still made him stay there.


I guess the people back on Earth have to eventually learn that anyone who comes through that portal never comes back.


Tommy stumbled through the crystal portal at 14, while out camping, naturally stuck with the worst job: collecting wood. Tommy, being a dumb teenager, let his stupid curiosity get the best of him.


Well, that's what Tommy thought about his curiosity. Something that just gets you in more trouble than you were at the beginning.


Quinn disagrees with Tommy, though. He always says, ""Curiosity is something everyone has, Tommy,"" and then he recites a quote from a random person who died hundreds of years ago. 


The only quote Tommy could think of was, “Curiosity killed the cat.” Well, he guessed he was officially a dead cat.


Quinn is one of Tommy's best friends since he was transported to this dimension. He was the one at the portal to greet him. Now he's just a bozo who lives on the outskirts of town and mops about his friend that died half a year ago.


Quinn was good about hiding his emotions. His poker face was something else. Sometimes, Tommy forgot he was still sad about his best friend. Quinn wore this nonchalant face most of the time. The only times he would break his facade were when he would make fun of him or if he was really mad, which never really happened.


Maybe he just needs a beer. *Maybe I need beer. I could be a bartender—oh wait, underage. Well, in the U.S anyway…*


His thoughts were flying around like whoosh. 


Whoosh… whoosh whoosh. WHOOSH WHOOSH! 


Hold up, these weren’t just his thoughts now, this was something real! Something close, and… OH! The puzzle pieces finally connected, sending his body into immediate and primitive action. 


Tommy braced himself as the portal whipped leaves and debris into the air. 


“What the f-” He was cut off by a loud boom, knocked off his feet, saving him from letting out the most vulgar stream of curses.


Tommy took a glance at the portal just in time to see a large shadow fly past him onto the ground.


“Oh DAYUM!!!,” Tommy wasn’t afraid to state his opinion now.


He peered down at the poor thing that had been deposited into this land. There was a girl on the ground. She wore a black T-shirt and skinny jeans, her long brown hair tangled from the fall. She also looked around Quinn’s age.


The foreigner was a pretty girl and looked as if she were about to take a trip to her local Starbucks, like most people Tommy’s age. Maybe she already has Starbucks on her.


“Yo, you good bro?” Tommy asked while putting his hand out to help her up.


“I’ve been better,” The girl snarled at him. “What’s your name?”


*Why was she being so aggressive? Why was she not asking questions about what the hell just happened? And WHY did she come BARRELING through the portal like a pissed bull!?*


This was Tommy’s second time helping someone who came through the portal. The first time was when he helped out a girl named Lexi who was obsessed with Quinn.


The girl stood up, ignoring Tommy’s offer to help her up. “Where am I?”


Now this is the part Tommy HATED. He hated when he had to tell people that “You're in a different dimension” and “You can't go back to earth,” because he would then get bombarded with tears and questions. LOTS of questions. 


Well, that’s what Lexi did anyway. She’s come to terms with her situation by now, so she's somewhat manageable.


“Well, this is Austin,” Tommy responded.


“Texas does not have weird bluish grass and rolling hills everywhere,” The girl responded, annoyed, “And I asked you for your name.”


“Well, eff you too,” Tommy growled at her.


“Excuse me?” She said, raising an eyebrow, “Why are you being so rude all of a sudden?”


“Why are you being so rude?” He shot her a glare.


“Maybe it’s because I'm not in a good mood right now. I just got pushed through a portal.”


“Wait, you got pushed?” *Well, that explains the tumble. Not exactly a graceful entrance. *


“Yes, I got pushed, and I don’t feel like telling you about it right now,” the girl responded, “Now tell me your name.”


“My name’s Tommy.”


“Tommy? You sound like a little kid.”


“Wow, original,” Tommy muttered. “Quinn says that, too. Now tell me your name.”


“Kaitlyn,” she responded, “see how easy that was?”


Wow. Kaitlyn’s annoying already.


Tommy chuckled to himself.


“What are you laughing at?” Kaitlyn asked.


“Uh, I’m laughing at you, duh.”


Kaitlyn didn’t respond. Instead, she just gave Tommy a look that screamed, “You’re more annoying than me,” and “How dare you?” at the same time.


“So, how do I get out of here?” Kaitlyn asked, ignoring Tommy's previous remark.


“You don’t.”


Kaitlyn stayed silent for a moment. She stayed so silent that you could hear the crickets and birds chirping as the three moons rose from the horizon.


“Hmm, ok,” she said with a neutral tone.


“Huh? You're not worried at all?” Tommy was now really confused. Lexi was the complete opposite of Kaitlyn when she came out of the portal.


“My life was shitty anyways,” she said, “Now I get to start a new one in this place.”


Tommy blinked. That was… not the answer he was expecting.


*Really? Kaitlyn’s life’s shitty? She does a good job of hiding that fact. She’s kinda like Quinn with hiding her emotions and stuff.*


Tommy felt like Kaitlyn started to like him more because of how she started to open up more. 


*Maybe she isn’t that bad. You just gotta get to know her. I knew a few people like that.*


“Well, it’s getting late, maybe we shou-” Before Tommy got to finish his message, a person came around the corner and started demanding things.  


It was Tommy’s boss, Derek, or what Derek would call himself “Mr. Vance,” because it “sounded more professional.” Tommy did not like Derek.


“Hey Tommy, can I get you to guard those stupid magical books for the night shif-” Seeing Kaitlyn standing there, Derek cut himself off. 


He was too late, however. Kaitlyn now knows that this continent is magic.


Tommy’s heart skipped a beat.---Those books are dangerous, and Derek shouldn’t have mentioned them so casually. 


“Magical books?” Kaitlyn said. Tommy made a face at Derek, who always tells Tommy not to spill the secret about the enchanted books. Ironically, it was Sr. Vance himself who slipped up.


“I-I-uh, hmm,” Derek was now deep in thought. Tommy did not like that.


“Guess I have to hire you, know,” Derek suggested, “You’ll need to make money here eventually.”


“Excuse me? You don’t even know me yet. I don't know you yet,” Kaitlyn said, “This guy’s your boss?”


“Yeah.”


“Well then, let's get to know each other!” Derek exclaimed, “I’m Mr. Vance, or just Derek, nice to meet you. Y’know, we haven't had anyone new come out of the portal in a few months.”


“People coming out of a crystal-white portal is normal for you?” Kaitlyn asked. 


Kaitlyn looked around at her surroundings again; Blue-green grass, white, crystal portals, strange men asking to hire you, yeah, nothing here is normal.


“Yeah, people used to come out of the portal so often! I wonder why fewer people are coming out.” Derek said, “Anyways, your name?”


“My name is Kaitlyn.”


“Well, Kaitlyn, I promise you I'm a good boss! There’s a reason Tommy isn’t homeless. I’ll start you at 30 bucks an hour, how bout that?” Derek said, reaching his hand out for a handshake.


“Tommy, can I trust this guy?” Kaitlyn whispered to Tommy.


*She’s asking me for advice. Does this mean she trusts me?*


“He’s not my favorite person, but he doesn't have evil intentions.” Tommy responded, “Like he could easily become the most powerful person with those books, but he chooses not to.”


“Probably because if he does, everyone would then know about the books, and people will probably get their hands on at least one,” Kaitlyn said.


“You knew that just by observing him?”


“Alright then, I’ll accept your deal,” Kaitlyn said, ignoring Tommy as well as shaking Derek’s hand.


“Amazing! I’ll tell you when you can start working. In the meantime, Tommy, can you show Kaitlyn around town? I’ll take over portal duties for the night.”


“I was going to do that anyway.”


“Alright, make sure she also has a place to sleep,” Derek responded, “It’s almost nighttime.”


“Ok, ok,” Tommy then turned and tugged Kaitlyn along.


“Oh, that’s weird,” Kaitlyn said while looking up at the night sky.


She was looking at the three moons. Tommy had forgotten that there was only one moon on Earth. When Lexi arrived through the portal, it was daytime, so she couldn't have asked Tommy about the 
moons.


*Yeah. That must be strange for her.*


“Why are there three moons?” 


“Bruh I don’t know,” Tommy responded, “Why does Earth only have 1 moon?”


“Ok, no need to give me attitude.”


After a few minutes, Tommy and Kaitlyn eventually reach the town of Austin. They arrived on a fairly thin path with shops and bars lighting up the space.


“So what did your boss mean about those magical books?” Kaitlyn asked as they passed a bustling bar.


The pair could hear chatter coming from the bar, as well as glass clinking with each other.


“They’ve been there since like, forever. And they give you special powers depending on what book you enchant yourself with.” Tommy explained.


“Really? Bro, this place is weird.” Kaitlyn said, “So why doesn't Derek just enchant himself with all the books?”


“Well, when you open one of the books, the power will be on the first page with the rest of the book being blank, but if you enchant yourself, you will also get a curse along with your power,” Tommy explained.


“Uh huh,” Kaitlyn was confused, “So if the rest of the book is blank, how did you guys learn about the curse?”


“Well.. uh,” Tommy hesitated.


I mean, it's not my secret, but then again, she will find out eventually, and then she won’t tell me. But she will meet him, and then he won’t be that happy with me. 


“My friend Quinn enchanted himself.”


“Oh, you mentioned him earlier, right? So what did Derek do to him?” Kaitlyn was asking him a lot of questions that could determine his friendship with Quinn forever.


“Derek banished him from the town,” He said, “He lives on the outskirts.”


“Do you still visit him? Because you said he’s your friend.”


“Well, he might not be anymore because of what I’m telling you right now,” Tommy explained, “He likes it when people don’t think he’s a selfish person.”


“Well.. is he?”


“NO,” Tommy yelled, “He’s the nicest and chillest person I’ve ever met! You’ll see what I mean when you eventually meet him.”


“Erm, if he's so nice, then why did he enchant himself?” Kaitlyn asked, “And what did he enchant himself with? What was his curse?”


*UGHHHHHHHHH. I knew this would happen. People always ask waaaaaaay too many questions. *


“He’s got..” Tommy hesitated, “Really… tough skin.”


“Tough skin? You couldn't think of something better?”


“I’m telling the truth! I’ve only seen him get hurt from blades.”


“Yeah, ok,” Kaitlyn said, not convinced, “And what’s his curse? He doesn't have legs?”


“Ok, bro,” Tommy said with an annoyed voice, “I’m telling the truth!”


“Then why were you stuttering?”


“Because I didn’t know if Quinn would want me to tell you.”


“Hm,” Kaitlyn started to think carefully about what she was about to say, “Guess you were telling the truth.”


Well, that was way easier than I thought it would be.


The pair continued to walk down the path when the temperature started to drop, and a distinct pine smell entered their noses. Eventually, snow started to show up on homes, stores, and the ground.


“So uh,” Kaitlyn said, breaking the silence, “What was Quinn’s curse?”


*Yeah, Quinn’s gonna kill me.*


“It’s okay if you don't want to tell me.”


“No, no, I’ll tell you. You’ll find out eventually.”


“So… what is it?” This is probably the first time Kaitlyn has been curious in a while.


Kaitlyn didn’t seem like the type of person to be this interested in someone. You can only get to know her if she wants to get to know you… which she does. 


Tommy looked away. “He can’t…” He took a deep breath. “He doesn’t feel love for living things.”


Kaitlyn stayed silent for a minute before finally saying something.


“Oh, that’s sad,” Kaitlyn ducked her head down to stare at the ground.


“Yeah,” Tommy responded.


“I feel bad for him, and I haven’t even met him yet.”


“Yeah. He didn't even know that he had cursed himself until his best friend died a few months ago,” Tommy spoke a little more quietly, the more he spoke about Quinn. “He didn’t appreciate what he had until-”


“Until it was too late,” Kaitlyn finished for him, “I know what it feels like to be in that situation.”


“Well, anyway, here we are.”


Tommy and Kaitlyn stopped in front of 2 medium-sized huts next to each other, made out of brick and wood. There was also another house far behind the other houses, 800m away. 


“Where are we?” Kaitlyn asked.


“The edge of town,” Tommy responded, “And that’s my house.”


Tommy pointed to the hut on the right. Someone was awake in the other hut because of the light coming from it. The hut in the back also had light coming from it.


“Who’s your neighbor?”


“That’s Lexi’s house, you can meet her later,” Tommy said while pointing to the house on the left, “And the house in the back is Quinn’s.”


“Oh,” Kaitlyn said, sounding surprised, “Well, I guess this is the edge of the town, so that will be the outskirts.”


“Yeah, let’s head inside,” Tommy suggested, “I’m tired.”


As soon as the pair stepped inside, Kaitlyn was immediately hit with a scent of applewood and nostalgia. Tommy was probably already used to the smell because, well... he lived here.


Tommy’s house was pretty cozy. It felt like a woodsy cabin—warm, simple, and safe. Lanterns lighting up the room, which gave it a golden yellow look. 


There were weapons hung up on the wall as well. There was an axe, a sword, a bow, and a pickaxe. All the tools were made out of metal except for the bow which was made out of a wood that was a slightly lighter brown then the cabin.


“This place is cozy, Tommy.”


“Yeah, I know,” Tommy responded, “I chose this side of town because it’s somewhere only we know.”


“What do you mean?”


“Like, only me, Lexi, and Quinn live here,” Tommy explained.


The pair walked into the center of the house, entering the main living room. 


The living room had a bed in the corner with a bookshelf propped up at the end of the bed. It also had a couch with a coffee table in front of a clear, glass window. Connected to the living room was the kitchen.


“Erm, you got anything to eat?”


“Check the fridge or the cabinet,” Tommy responded.


Kaitlyn stepped on the wooden planks as she walked over to the fridge and cabinets. She found herself in front of various vegetables and fruits when she opened the fridge.


“Well, well, well,” Kaitlyn said, raising an eyebrow at the neatly stocked fridge, “I thought you would eat processed stuff.”


“Well, it’s not like we have factories here that produce an endless amount of Doritos,” Tommy explained, “The time we get to eat processed stuff is when someone comes through with snacks, but 
even then you have to buy it off them.”


“So you only eat carrots and apples?”


“No, I eat meat, but it’s all raw right now, and it’s too late to cook something up.” 


“Huh, ok,” Kaitlyn snatched an apple out of the fridge and closed it.


Kaitlyn sat down on Tommy’s couch and took a bite of the Grammy Smith. 


“You can sleep on my bed,” Tommy offered, “I’ll take the couch.”


“Don’t pity me,” Kaitlyn replied. “I’ll take the couch.”


Tommy rolled his eyes and stepped towards his bed. “Goodnight.”


“Night.”


The pair turned around to face away from each other as they dozed off.

My professor was 10 years older than me, and married. I really admired him and his work, and he did me. Tbh the chemistry between us was intense. We were both smart enough to know we couldn't go there, so we didn't talk about it, didn't act on it, and for a while tbh I thought I might be imagining it.

But the year we both left uni, he went to another college, I moved away, and professional boundaries evaporated. We talked all the time, all hours, from the day I left, and honestly didn't stop for like a year.

We said we'd both known from the beginning that there was something about us, but also that we couldn't mess up my degree or his career. We were kind of proud of ourselves for being so responsible, in a weird way.

We hung out a few times. Nothing romantic, we'd just talk, or grab coffee. It felt like I could see straight into his soul and he could see into mine (he said this, too). Neither of us had ever experienced anything quite like that before. We'd openly admit to each other that we wished we could act on what we felt, but didn't. We just existed in this strange, intense friendship that was definitely more than friendship but never became anything physical.

We had this connection that was deeper than most relationships I've had - familial, romantic or platonic. I definitely caught feelings. Not love, but something that mattered.

We both seemed to understand that it couldn't go on without someone getting hurt, eventually we stopped talking and drifted apart. It's been a couple of years now. He reached out on Facebook last year and said he'd never clicked 'add friend' so fast until he saw me. I think we both know not to talk more, still.

He's still married, his wife posted on Facebook just last week about how they never got the seven-year itch, how they've always been madly in love. It's weird reading that when you know it's not entirely true. Weirder that I don't feel guilty about it anymore.

Part of me misses him. It's probably just that feeling of being completely understood by someone.

Nobody knows about any of this except us. And now you, I guess. It honestly feels good to get it out.",2,1753869867.0,offmychest,0,0.67,False

Preferably in that order. I ordered food, flopped onto my bed like a wet towel, and waited.

Delivery guy calls. Food is here. Life is good. I grab my wallet, ready to pay and that’s when it hit me. Not inspiration. Not enlightenment. No. The horrifying realization that my key was not in my wallet. It was still stuck in the inside of my room door. Mocking me from behind cold, unyielding wood.

I stared at my locked door like it had personally betrayed me. I called our dorm agent for a spare, but apparently the spare now lives in a drawer somewhere, collecting dust and broken dreams.

So I zombie-walked back to the hospital to find my dormmate (bless her soul), because she had the only other copy. I think I was powered purely by frustration and the smell of my now-cooling takeout.

And just when I thought the universe was done, a week later, all five of us dormmates got locked out at once. Nobody had a key. Not one. Five grown adults. Locked out. We got back in, but I’m taking that secret to the grave unless someone bribes me with garlic rice and iced coffee.

1md2keo,https://i.redd.it/qxoj3ylbjzff1.jpeg,"$ATYR – Lessons from a Short Attack: Science, Psychology, and Staying the Course","Hi folks,

I’m jumping in with a post I didn’t expect to have to write, but after what’s played out over the last few days, I think it’s absolutely necessary. For months, the $ATYR conversation has been shaped by genuinely thoughtful analysis, healthy debate, and a kind of quiet confidence—a market environment where we could all focus on the science, the setup, and the probabilities. That changed this week. We’ve suddenly seen a coordinated wave of bearish reports, short-focused social campaigns, and-let’s call it what it is-an uptick in attacks and pile-on behaviour, both directed at individuals and across the community.

It’s easy to get rattled by this kind of action. It’s also easy to forget that, just a few months ago, the tape was eerily quiet and the price action sleepy. If you’re newer to biotech or haven’t lived through these “set piece” volatility episodes, it can feel overwhelming. I get it-this is where the game gets real.

I want to be very clear: this post isn’t about hype, defending my own position, or attacking anyone personally. It’s about pausing, taking a breath, and using this moment to learn as a community. We’re here to reduce information asymmetry, sharpen our process, and get better at reading market psychology-especially when things get noisy and emotional.

I put a ridiculous number of hours into these deep dives, not for the clicks but for the craft, for the community, and for the chance to help others think more clearly about stocks like $ATYR. If you find value in this kind of work and want to support more of it, you can always buy me a coffee at coff.ee/BioBingo. Every bit helps and is deeply appreciated.

Why now? Because, frankly, these episodes are part of the territory if you want to play in the biotech sandbox, especially when a binary event is on the horizon. When you see the “main characters” suddenly appear, the volume go parabolic, and the tone shift from debate to attack, you know something important is happening beneath the surface. That’s when it’s most important to pause, step back, and try to see the bigger picture.

Let’s break it down-what just happened, who’s involved, what’s actually at play under the hood, and, most importantly, what we can learn from all this as a community.

Let’s get into it.

---

### **Why now? What’s actually happened this week**

Over the past few days, something fundamentally shifted in the $ATYR ecosystem. For weeks, we’d been watching the stock move in a relatively tight range with mostly calm trading-an almost sleepy tape, especially for a company with a major binary event on the horizon. That changed dramatically this week, when we saw an abrupt and powerful surge in both trading volume and social media activity. The volume on back-to-back days exploded to more than 12 million shares, a figure that dwarfs typical trading for $ATYR and immediately caught the attention of anyone watching market structure.

But it wasn’t just the numbers. There was an obvious, almost overnight flood of bearish reports and coordinated negative sentiment on platforms like X and Reddit. High-profile players and previously quiet accounts suddenly appeared, all with the same theme: heavy skepticism, vocal short positions, and, in some cases, open attacks directed at both individual bulls and the broader retail community. The tone of the conversation changed. It shifted from healthy debate to pile-on, with certain accounts driving a more aggressive narrative and making personal remarks or accusations.

I’ve seen it firsthand- not just as someone who posts analysis, but as a participant and observer in these communities. It wasn’t only me; several other visible community members and even retail holders like Tweedle and the CountryDumb community became the subject of targeted replies and, at times, ridicule. These were not the kinds of discussions or critiques that deepen our understanding or help people make better decisions. They were, frankly, meant to shake confidence, create uncertainty, and exploit any sense of unease in the run-up to the catalyst window.

What stands out about this moment isn’t just the scale of the activity, but its timing. This all happened right as $ATYR approached the critical weeks before its expected Phase 3 readout—a window when uncertainty is already high and the stakes couldn’t be higher for either side of the trade. For long-term observers, the contrast with the previous “quiet” period is stark. The pattern is familiar to anyone who’s watched pre-catalyst biotech names: a sudden burst of volume, negative coverage, and emotional energy right when the market is most fragile.

### **Who’s involved? The main players and their methods**

One thing that’s become clear in the past week is just how quickly the cast of characters can change in the world of small-cap biotech. While many in the $ATYR community are used to seeing the same names debating the science or trial design, we’ve suddenly had an influx of new—and some not-so-new—voices stepping into the spotlight.

Martin Shkreli is probably the highest-profile of the group. For anyone newer to this space, Shkreli is a former hedge fund manager and biotech CEO who has become notorious both for his role in several headline-grabbing drug price controversies and for his criminal conviction in 2017 for securities fraud, resulting in a ban from the securities industry. He’s also been the subject of regulatory scrutiny (see his [FINRA BrokerCheck](https://brokercheck.finra.org/individual/summary/4817386)) and numerous media investigations, including a [feature in STAT News](https://www.statnews.com/2017/07/20/martin-shkreli-short-selling-biotech-stocks/) documenting his past use of social media to amplify short positions and stir controversy in biotech stocks. In the last few days, Shkreli has published a bear report on $ATYR and has been particularly active across social channels, vocally short and directly engaging with retail holders.

But Shkreli isn’t acting alone. Alongside his campaign, we’ve seen the emergence of accounts pushing the same or similar talking points, sometimes linking to other bearish articles—such as the [Anthony Staj Substack report](https://anthonystaj.substack.com/p/atyr-a-platform-in-search-of-an-indication)—and often engaging in a pattern of rapid, coordinated replies to bullish posts. What’s notable is how quickly the conversation has shifted from substantive critique of the company or its trial to personal remarks, attempts to discredit individual bulls, or to question the motives and character of community members. It’s not only me; I’ve observed other high-conviction retail holders like CountryDumb become targets as well, facing a barrage of dismissive or even mocking replies.

At the same time, it’s important to acknowledge that not all new commentary has been agenda-driven or negative in tone. There have been objective, risk-aware voices—like [Erik Otto’s detailed analysis](https://medium.com/@ottoerik/atyr-pharma-pivotal-pre-ramble-3c23a510378a)—that take a measured, evidence-based approach to both bull and bear arguments. The difference is in both *what* is being discussed and *how* it’s being presented. Debate is healthy and valuable. Personal attacks, dogpiling, and attempts to shut down discussion aren’t.

In short, what we’re seeing isn’t just a shift in sentiment, but a shift in behaviour and in the way the “main characters” are trying to control the narrative. It’s a pattern that’s familiar to anyone who’s watched high-stakes catalysts in biotech, but it’s worth pausing to recognise the distinction between constructive debate and coordinated campaign.

### **Objective critique: The “short report” in focus**

There’s no question these short reports have made the rounds, so it’s worth actually getting granular—both to understand where they’re coming from and to ask whether the conclusions they reach actually fit the evidence. I’m not a clinician or a statistician, but as someone who’s spent far too many hours on both sides of the biotech table, I think it’s critical to get specific, not just loud. Here’s how I see the main claims and the alternative (often omitted) views:

**1. Mechanism of Action & Scientific Rationale**

- **Bear report claim:** Efzofitimod’s mechanism in sarcoidosis is unclear, unproven, or possibly even irrelevant; the drug is “a platform in search of an indication.”
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - The *Science Translational Medicine* paper (March 2025) was *not* addressed at all in the Fourier Transform or Anthony Staj reports. This paper presents direct evidence that efzofitimod binds NRP2 and reprograms inflammatory macrophages to a resolving phenotype—exactly the mechanism implicated in sarcoidosis pathology.
    - Most of the bear thesis leans on the older “the mechanism is unknown” critique, which is now at odds with current peer-reviewed literature. In my view, this is an outdated stance.
    - It’s true the mechanism is novel and under continued study. But “novel” is not the same as “irrelevant.” The same could be said for the original anti-TNF drugs before their MOA was fully mapped in autoimmune disease.

**2. Phase 2 Baseline Imbalances & Dose Response**

- **Bear report claim:** The Phase 2 result is confounded by baseline FVC imbalance and small sample size—higher-dose patients just happened to be sicker, creating an illusion of efficacy.
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - It’s valid to scrutinise any rare-disease trial with N=30–40, but both reports overstate the ability of baseline imbalances to fully account for the observed *dose-dependent* response. A confounder could cause random differences, but it’s unlikely to create a clear, linear dose effect across both the primary and several secondary endpoints.
    - This issue has been addressed in detail by Erik Otto (see his [Pre-Ramble analysis](https://medium.com/@ottoerik/atyr-pharma-pivotal-pre-ramble-3c23a510378a)), who explains that the FVC imbalance, while real, does not mathematically explain the magnitude or the pattern of the results. Otto points out that both endpoints and exploratory measures point in the same direction—statistically improbable if confounding were the only driver.
    - If the imbalance were fatal, we would expect far more erratic results, not the directional consistency actually observed.

**3. Steroid Reduction Design and Interpretation**

- **Bear report claim:** The steroid reduction endpoint is “easily gamed” or not relevant; companies have failed before using steroid sparing as a target.
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - The argument that steroid reduction is “gamed” underestimates the clinical and regulatory context. The actual trial enrolled patients on chronic steroids (typically >6 months use), who represent the most refractory, hard-to-treat population. In real clinical practice, durable steroid reduction *is* a meaningful outcome and is valued by both patients and payers.
    - The reports do not reference the FDA’s recent guidance or actual review standards for rare ILDs, where steroid reduction, in combination with functional improvement, has increasingly become an approvable and even preferred endpoint.
    - There is no evidence in the public domain that investigators or sponsors manipulated steroid tapering protocols; the design matches current clinical reality.

**4. Scientific Communications and Company Behaviour**

- **Bear report claim:** aTyr has been “promotional” or “hyped” the drug beyond the evidence.
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - aTyr’s communications and conference presentations are in line with what is expected of a microcap biotech seeking both survival and awareness—there’s no evidence of material overstatement compared to peers.
    - Both short reports overlook or ignore the fact that aTyr has *not* overpromised timelines, has been candid about risk, and repeatedly disclosed trial limitations and unknowns.
    - When compared to more notorious “hype” campaigns in biotech, aTyr is actually among the more conservative communicators—no speculative revenue projections, no “miracle cure” language.

**5. Selective Use of Data and Omission of Positive Evidence**

- **Bear report claim:** Only the negatives and risks are emphasised.
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - The short reports do not engage with the mechanistic findings from the recent translational medicine publications or with the fact that preclinical data (including in animal models) has been increasingly corroborative, not contradictory.
    - Key pieces of evidence supporting the drug’s effect—including the consistent safety signal and exploratory biomarker improvements—are omitted or dismissed out of hand.
    - For anyone who’s spent time in biotech, this kind of “selection bias” is a hallmark of narrative-driven short campaigns. In my view, it’s a red flag when a report only seeks to confirm its own thesis.

**6. Regulatory and Competitive Barriers**

- **Bear report claim:** The FDA will be skeptical, and big pharma will not care.
- **Counterpoint / alternative view:**
    - The FDA has approved multiple first-in-class, rare-disease drugs in the past decade based on single, well-conducted pivotal studies with mechanistic plausibility and a clear safety benefit.
    - The recent “platform in search of an indication” critique is a common trope in early biotech, but there are just as many stories where a validated mechanism and one clean readout have triggered massive value creation or even takeouts (e.g., Acceleron, GW Pharma).
    - In my view, aTyr’s risk is not that it is a “science project,” but that the bar for success is high. The company either delivers a clear readout or not—there’s little room for ambiguity, which is exactly why these periods are so volatile.

**7. Tone and Intent**

- **Observation:** Both reports rely heavily on dramatic or dismissive language, characterising the company as “desperate,” the data as “the worst I’ve ever seen,” or the approach as “plainly doesn’t work.”
    - This tone is not evidence, and in my opinion, often signals either overconfidence or a desire to catalyse sentiment, not just share analysis.
    - Contrast with more measured pieces (see Otto’s linked above) that lay out risks and probabilities rather than black-and-white verdicts.

---

**In summary, the way I read it:**

The short reports raise valid risks that any serious investor should weigh—but, in my opinion, they present these as foregone conclusions rather than as probabilities, omit or dismiss emerging supportive evidence, and often reuse arguments that have already been accounted for by those following the science closely. There’s no shame in skepticism, but there is a difference between skepticism and selective storytelling. As always, I’d encourage everyone to read both the bearish and bullish arguments, but also to seek out balanced, rigorous work that is willing to quantify uncertainty and engage with the totality of the data, not just the worst-case headlines.

---

### **Comparing approaches: Otto’s balanced analysis vs. the bear case**

One of the most valuable things any investor can do—especially in a setup like this—is to compare different styles and standards of analysis side by side. In this case, we have a clear opportunity to do so: on one hand, we’ve got the recently circulated short reports, and on the other, a thoughtful, risk-aware, and evidence-based piece by Erik Otto, a former healthcare executive and life sciences investor, who’s been following $ATYR closely for years.

Otto’s “Pivotal Pre-Ramble” doesn’t gloss over the risks. In fact, it spends a lot of time openly discussing them: the novelty of the indication, the potential for trial failure, the difficulty in powering a study in rare disease, and the genuine risk that even a well-designed trial might miss its endpoints for reasons outside of management’s control. But the way Otto weighs evidence, frames uncertainty, and quantifies probability is, in my view, the mark of an institutional mindset. He lays out where he could be wrong, doesn’t try to spin “uncertainty” into “certainty,” and makes a point of distinguishing between risk factors and fatal flaws.

A few key areas where Otto’s analysis stands apart from the recent bear reports:

- **Addressing the FVC imbalance:**  
  Otto directly engages the question of baseline differences in the Phase 2 trial, explaining why, in his view, the magnitude and directionality of the results across multiple endpoints can’t be explained by that imbalance alone. He walks through the statistics and lays out why a pure “placebo effect” is extremely unlikely to produce the pattern seen—especially in a tough, steroid-refractory patient group.

- **Understanding the clinical context:**  
  Rather than dismissing steroid reduction as “gamed” or meaningless, Otto explains why long-term steroid users represent a group of patients most in need of new options—and why even incremental steroid-sparing effects are meaningful to both clinicians and regulators. He references recent FDA guidance and clinical standards that bear reports simply don’t address.

- **Risk assessment as a spectrum, not a verdict:**  
  Otto puts a 60–70% probability on a successful Phase 3 readout—not a “slam dunk,” but a conviction-weighted, realistic number in the world of biotech investing. He walks through the risks of population heterogeneity, regulatory precedent, and the challenge of novel mechanisms without resorting to hyperbole.

- **Tone and methodology:**  
  What stands out most, in my view, is Otto’s focus on intellectual honesty and process. He synthesises both sides, offers up alternative scenarios, and never tries to paper over the uncertainties. It’s the kind of piece that helps the reader build a risk-adjusted mental model—not just an emotional reaction.

For anyone weighing the latest wave of bearish sentiment, Otto’s approach is a blueprint for what institutional-grade research looks like: honest about risks, sceptical where it matters, but always grounded in evidence and process. I’d encourage anyone to read his piece in full (linked above), compare it directly with the short reports, and ask which approach leaves you better equipped to make a reasoned decision.

### **Market structure: the setup beneath the surface**

To understand why the narrative and volatility have both exploded this week, it’s important to zoom out and look at the actual market structure for $ATYR right now. This isn’t just about who’s arguing loudest on X or Reddit—it’s about who actually owns the stock, how much of the float is truly available, and how positioning and options flow set the stage for price action.

First, institutional ownership is officially high—about 69.8% of shares as of the last Fintel update. But as discussed earlier, that data is as of 30 March and is now four months old. Since then, we’ve had several trading days with 10–12 million shares changing hands—numbers that suggest meaningful rotation in the float. With another institutional filing deadline coming up mid-August, we won’t have the true picture until then. The reality is that, right now, only a handful of brokers and large players really know who holds the float.

Second, short interest remains very high, at over 18 million shares (more than 21% of the float by Nasdaq’s latest data). Off-exchange (dark pool) short volume has spiked as well, at times making up more than 80% of all off-exchange activity. In other words, the short side is not just active, but aggressive—and possibly crowded.

Third, the options chain is fully loaded for the next several months. There’s enormous open interest at key strikes ($5, $6, $7.50, $10 and higher), with both puts and calls heavily traded, especially for August, September, and January 2026. Implied volatility is sky-high—routinely 180–450%—and the put/call ratio is high but not extreme. This is classic for a true binary event: the market is prepared for fireworks in either direction.

What does this mean in practical terms? It means that much of the float is now locked up in the hands of institutions, high-conviction retail holders, and aggressive shorts. It means that the actual “tradable” float—what’s truly available to force a move or cover a squeeze—is far lower than it might look on paper. And it means that, as we approach the readout, both sides have layered on enormous leverage through the options market, with every uptick or downtick amplified by delta-hedging, forced covering, or margin pressure.

Structurally, $ATYR is set up for high drama. With the catalyst window now just weeks away, the setup beneath the surface explains why both narrative and price action have become so heated—and why any sharp move, up or down, could become reflexive and outsized in a very short window.

So, is the setup bullish, bearish, or just dangerous? In my opinion, what makes $ATYR so interesting right now is how asymmetric the positioning has become. On one hand, you’ve got a very high short interest, a float that’s likely much tighter than it appears on the surface, and a retail community that’s actually shown staying power through several shakeouts. On the other, the options market is pricing in wild volatility—so even a modest move could be exaggerated by dealer hedging or short covering.

If you’re a trader looking for a “clean” directional bet, this is not a setup for the faint of heart. The market is basically screaming “expect violence”—and that could cut both ways, depending on who blinks first. But in my view, if the readout comes in positive or even just “good enough,” the sheer weight of short interest and the lack of freely trading shares could trigger a classic squeeze—one that’s more reflexive and self-reinforcing than anything we’ve seen so far. On the flip side, a clearly negative readout or a major trial miss would see the floor fall out just as quickly, with everyone running for the exits at once.

So, I’d call it structurally “explosive,” and, if pressed, a setup that skews bullish **if** the fundamentals deliver. The risk is real, but the potential for asymmetric upside—at least from this starting point—is hard to ignore. It’s the kind of setup that, in my view, explains why the attacks and narrative pressure have suddenly ramped up: both sides know that the tape is tight and the stakes are high.

### **From debate to dogpile: how the narrative shifted**

It’s been striking to watch the tone and content of $ATYR discourse change almost overnight. For months, most discussion around this stock was remarkably civil and analytical, even when there was sharp disagreement. The focus was on the science, the clinical trial design, the risks, and the commercial opportunity. Bulls and bears both showed up, but even the bears were generally engaged in reasoned, data-driven debate.

Over the last week, that equilibrium broke down. What started as a trickle of skepticism and critique quickly turned into a wave of coordinated attacks, personal jabs, and repetitive, sometimes hostile, messaging—especially across social media platforms. It became less about weighing probabilities or discussing endpoints, and more about dominating the conversation and driving sentiment.

What’s fascinating to me is how, in all of this, the underlying science hasn’t changed at all. I’ve revisited the data, the mechanism, and the clinical risk from every angle I can find. I’ve gone through the translational science, the design of the Phase 3, the regulatory alignment, the critiques from both sides, and the way these kinds of rare disease biotechs are usually picked apart. My own view—openly stated, and not advice—is that the science still stacks up. The translational evidence for the NRP2 mechanism is more compelling now than ever, the clinical signal in Phase 2 was dose-dependent and directionally robust, and every time I come back to the bear arguments, I see points worth thinking about but nothing that, to me, fundamentally refutes the core thesis.

In other words: the narrative shifted, but the evidence did not. My conviction comes not from ignoring market psychology or dismissing risk, but from repeatedly finding that, when you put the data under the microscope and hold it to the same standard you’d apply to any event-driven biotech, the case for efzofitimod holds up. That’s not a guarantee of success; it’s just the way I see the evidence, given the totality of what’s on the table.

This isn’t unique to $ATYR, and I think it’s important to recognise the pattern for what it is. We see this sort of behaviour emerge in biotech (and other event-driven trades) whenever the stakes get high and the float gets tight. As the catalyst window approaches, both sides get nervous, and for those running a short campaign, the incentive shifts from intellectual debate to outright narrative warfare. The goal isn’t just to convince, but to overwhelm—to create enough noise and anxiety that holders second-guess themselves and liquidity becomes available for those on the other side to cover or reposition.

What’s especially notable is that this narrative escalation isn’t always about who’s “right” on the science or the data. It’s about market psychology, power, and positioning. As soon as the conversation becomes dominated by attacks, memes, or attempts to discredit individuals rather than ideas, you can be pretty sure that the fundamentals have temporarily taken a back seat to the game being played on the tape.

For the community, it’s a challenge: how do you keep your head clear and your process disciplined when the discussion turns from debate to dogpile? It starts with recognising the shift for what it is—a sign that the stakes are real, that the event is near, and that everyone, on both sides, feels the pressure. It doesn’t mean ignore the risks; it means double down on doing your own work, checking your process, and refusing to let narrative drown out nuance.

### **Analysis & hypothesis: what’s really going on (and why)**

After everything we’ve covered—across hundreds of pages of research, world-class analysis, and months of back-and-forth with the best tools and minds available—I think it’s fair to lay out the most robust hypotheses that explain what we’re seeing now. These aren’t wild guesses; they’re scenario-based, evidence-driven, and attempt to connect all the dots: market mechanics, psychology, and the science itself.

#### **Hypothesis 1: The Bear Raid Is a Classic Pre-Catalyst Play, Not Driven by New Data**

- The timing and sudden surge in negative narrative isn’t based on new scientific revelations or data drops. Instead, it’s a set-piece play that appears time and again in micro-cap biotech, especially when a binary event is imminent and the float is tight.
- The objective: shake confidence, trigger stop-losses, and generate desperately needed liquidity for shorts to cover or reposition before the tape goes illiquid at readout.
- Evidence: We’ve seen similar campaigns before every major binary event in this sector. The pattern is classic: personal attacks, flooding social with “worst data ever” language, coordinated focus on a handful of “flaws,” and total disregard for recent advances (like the Science Translational Medicine mechanism paper).

#### **Hypothesis 2: The Market Structure Is Asymmetric—Positioned for a Reflexive Move**

- Right now, both long and short positions are crowded, with an options chain that could exaggerate any price action post-readout.
- Short interest is high and retail conviction is stronger than average; much of the float is not “loose hands.” As a result, if there’s a positive or even just “okay” readout, the odds of a parabolic move (forced covering, dealer hedging, FOMO) are materially higher than in a typical biotech.
- If the readout is negative, the same structural features mean there’s little support below, and the price could gap down sharply as stops and dealers sell into weakness.

#### **Hypothesis 3: Even a “Mixed” or “Good Enough” Result Favors Upside (Given This Setup)**

- The setup isn’t binary in the sense of “hero or zero.” Given the market structure, even a readout that’s not a clear home run—something “good enough” to support an NDA or partnership—could ignite significant upside.
- This is due to (a) the lack of loose float, (b) options dealer positioning, and (c) pent-up institutional/strategic interest in the sector for new, mechanistically differentiated rare disease drugs.
- The bar for a reflexive squeeze isn’t as high as many bearish voices would have you believe. A clearly positive result is one scenario; a “good enough” result still leads to significant positive repricing.

#### **Hypothesis 4: The Science and Regulatory Backdrop Provide a Real Floor for Probability**

- Our own review (across every available publication, mechanism analysis, and statistical angle) finds that the translational and clinical evidence still supports efficacy—especially when considering the NRP2 mechanism, the directionality of endpoints, and the recent FDA communication about endpoints in rare ILDs.
- Regulatory precedent is more favourable than the shorts suggest; the FDA has shown willingness to approve first-in-class drugs on clear, mechanism-based evidence with safety, especially in high-need populations.
- This isn’t a guarantee, but the weighted probability for a clean or “approvable” result remains higher than the market-implied odds, in my view.

#### **Hypothesis 5: The Narrative Shift Is Telling Us the Stakes Are High for Both Sides**

- The intensity and personal tone of the recent attacks are a signal in themselves. They suggest that both sides recognise how much is on the line, and that the price action—if the event surprises—could be far more violent than in a typical low-float biotech.
- When process and evidence remain strong but the narrative suddenly grows shrill and emotional, it’s often because the “game” is about to reach its most critical phase.

---

**Synthesis & takeaways:**

In sum, after looking at every angle—science, market structure, psychology, precedent, and narrative—the most robust interpretation is that $ATYR is set up for a highly asymmetric outcome. If the data are negative, there’s downside; if the data are mixed but defensible, the structure itself could drive a powerful upside move; and if the data are clean, the setup is there for a genuine “squeeze” scenario. The true signal is not in the noise of the current bear raid, but in the totality of evidence and the structural tension beneath the surface.

### **Community psychology: staying grounded in volatility**

If there’s one lesson that stands out from episodes like this, it’s that navigating event-driven biotech isn’t just about who has the best data or model. It’s about who can stay rational, objective, and process-focused while the noise is at its loudest. The last few days have tested that discipline for just about everyone in the $ATYR community. If you’re feeling rattled, you’re not alone.

I think it’s critical to recognise that coordinated narrative attacks and emotional pile-ons are designed to do one thing: shake confidence. They work because we’re wired, as humans, to respond more strongly to negativity and uncertainty—especially when the stakes are high. That’s why it’s so important to have a plan, a process, and some personal heuristics to keep yourself anchored when the market turns into a psychological battleground.

In my view, here are some ways I try to manage my own emotional state and maintain clarity:

- **Separate noise from signal:** Not every loud voice or viral thread is worth your attention. Ask yourself if the analysis actually brings something new to the table, or just amplifies fear.
- **Look for red flags:** When the debate shifts from facts to personal attacks, when the same few talking points are hammered over and over, or when conversation turns to mocking individuals rather than ideas, that’s a strong clue you’re dealing with agenda-driven posting—not robust research.
- **Trust your process:** Have your thesis, know your risk limits, and don’t let daily swings or new “main characters” online force you off course. Review your own work and sources, not just what’s trending on X.
- **Avoid impulsive decisions:** If you find yourself feeling emotional or pressured to act, take a step back. Biotech is inherently volatile, but no one is forcing you to trade on someone else’s timeline.
- **Engage in civil debate:** The best antidote to narrative warfare is a community that values evidence, respectful discussion, and learning. Push back on toxicity, but stay focused on what matters.

Ultimately, it’s about building emotional resilience and a decision-making process that isn’t derailed by the latest campaign or pile-on. The reality is that both bulls and bears want you to feel urgency—either to buy, sell, or defend a position—because that’s what creates liquidity and volatility. The job of a serious investor is to rise above the noise, stay analytical, and let process—not emotion—drive outcomes.

### **Lessons and takeaways: how to apply this in biotech investing**

Episodes like this are a powerful reminder that success in biotech investing is as much about process and mental discipline as it is about being right on the science. When the heat is on, narrative battles will always intensify, and volatility will bring out both the best and worst actors. What separates consistently successful investors from the rest is the ability to recognise patterns, learn from each campaign, and refine their own decision-making framework over time.

Here are a few lessons and practical takeaways I’ve found helpful, both from this $ATYR cycle and years of watching similar situations play out:

- **Develop a robust process for evaluating information.**  
  Don’t take any report—bullish or bearish—at face value. Dig into the underlying evidence, ask what’s new, what’s selective, and what’s omitted. If a claim is repeated everywhere but never substantiated with primary data, it’s probably narrative, not fact.

- **Build risk management rules before the catalyst, not after.**  
  Know your position size, your pain threshold, and what would make you change your mind. Don’t let market volatility force you into decisions you haven’t already thought through in advance.

- **Focus on asymmetric setups, not just binary outcomes.**  
  Some of the best opportunities (and biggest risks) arise when the market structure creates a setup where either the upside or downside is far greater than people realise. These moments are uncomfortable but can be very rewarding for those who are prepared.

- **Recognise when the game shifts from fundamentals to narrative.**  
  There are periods—like the week before a big readout—when the debate is no longer about evidence, but about control of the narrative and psychological advantage. Don’t confuse loudness with truth.

- **Stay humble and adaptive.**  
  Even the best deep-dive or process isn’t a guarantee of success. The point is to improve your odds, not to eliminate uncertainty. If the data or narrative changes in a way that genuinely undermines your thesis, be willing to revisit your conclusions.

- **Value process and community over short-term wins.**  
  The real long-term advantage is being part of a community that debates, challenges, and supports, rather than just chasing the latest “main character” drama or emotional swing.

In the end, every “bear raid” or narrative cycle is a chance to get better at the game, to see how the levers of psychology and market structure interact, and to refine your own framework for future decisions. Biotech isn’t easy, but it is learnable—and in my experience, the people who succeed over the long run are those who never stop iterating, questioning, and learning.

### **Conclusion & what comes next**

So, where does this leave us? In my view, this episode is both a test and an opportunity for anyone serious about biotech investing. It’s a test because the temptation to react to noise, narrative, or social pile-ons has probably never been greater. It’s an opportunity because, if you step back and stay focused on evidence and process, you can see just how much of this is “the game”—not a referendum on the underlying science or the long-term value of the company.

As we approach final weeks before a pivotal readout, I’d encourage everyone in the community to do what they’ve always done best: keep challenging, keep debating, and keep bringing analysis to the table. Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions—of me, of yourself, of anyone making bold claims in either direction. That’s what keeps the standard high.

I want to thank everyone who’s contributed thoughtful, evidence-driven discussion in the midst of the recent volatility.

### **Final note on community standards**

A quick note to close: over the last few days, a small number of individuals have landed in this community whose sole intent seemed to be abusive rather than constructive. I want to be fully transparent—while I very rarely moderate or ban anyone, in this case I’ve had to remove two users who crossed the line into personal abuse.

This community is, first and foremost, about learning, sharing ideas, and raising the collective standard of biotech analysis. It’s not just about $ATYR, but about building a space where rigorous debate and respectful disagreement are possible. That means there’s no room here for abuse, harassment, or attempts to derail discussion for the sake of provocation.

For anyone new, the ground rules are simple: treat each other with respect. Critique is  welcome; personal attacks are not. I want to keep this space open, transparent, and focused on the quality of thought that drew people here in the first place.",2,1753869782.0,ATYR_Alpha,1,1.0,False

Yes I know, people reading this are gonna call me out but, is matcha even likeable?  
Should I even call it an unpopular opinion, but I HATE Matcha.. Even though Matcha entered the food industry long back in the 19th century, it was not much popular, but gradually it gained people's acknowledgement and now here we are, Matcha being the global trend from the past few months. From marketers to influencers, everyone out there is trying so hard to promote matcha like they haven't had anything better than Matcha before.

If you ask me personally, the smell of it irritates me. Few weeks back me being me trying to fit into the changing trends of food, decided to try matcha. After a lot of research for the best places to try out matcha, i finally went to a place that had really good reviews online. No doubt, they are fabulous in doing their job, but my issue was THE MATCHA.  
I just felt like they have blended all the green vegetables that they had in their inventory, poured it into a glass, added some fancy shaped ice cubes and brought it to me in a pretty glass with a cute straw. It didn't even tasted like a mix of vegetables, rather it felt like drinking some kind of a powder that tasted weird, had a weird smell that would make me throw up.

I agree that Matcha as a drink definitely have it's own flavor and benefits as it is high in antioxidants and other beneficial compounds, but If you ask me I would rather not eat or drink something that has benefits but leaves a weird aftertaste on my tastebuds.

I know there are people out there who loves drinking Matcha, have even replaced their morning coffee with matcha, and that's totally fine.

I recently built a static website for a local coffee shop — just React, Nextjs . They loved it, but now they want to update parts of it themselves: the About section, some gallery images, maybe tweak the menu.

I didn’t want to set up a whole CMS or hook it up to Firebase/Supabase/Mongodb — it felt like massive overkill. So I started building a lightweight backend CMS that runs on the same server and stores all content as simple .json files. 

It has a protected API for editing/viewing those JSON files. 

Optional schema validation to avoid breaking layouts, No database, no cloud dependency. Just plug in your own frontend or UI

The idea is: anyone building static sites (for clients or themselves) could drop this in and get editable content without needing a full CMS.

My question is — does something like this already exist in a usable form? Have I missed something?

  
**TL;DR:**

**The Breakdown:**  
🌀 **Agate Stones (Water):** *Fluid blue layers* = emotional calm & intuition boost.  
🔥 **Red Metal (Fire):** *Copper* coils for passion + motivation (TCM ‘heart fire’ energy).  
🌳 **Ebony Wood (Wood):** *Sustainable* dark wood = growth & resilience.  
🌪️ **Brass Charms (Metal):** *Engraved wind symbols* to clear mental fog.  
🌎 **Black Obsidian (Earth):** *Grounded protection* against negativity.  

**Why It Works:**  
✅ **Geek Cred:** Each stone’s mineral composition *actually* resonates with its element (agate=water-formed silica).  
✅ **Adjustable Energy:** Feeling stressed? *Spin the wood bead.* Need focus? *Touch the metal.*  
✅ **Subtle Style:** Stackable without screaming ""HEY I’M SPIRITUAL"" (office-safe!).

# Monkey Flask Review 2025: Find The Best One Now!

The Monkey Flask is a popular insulated container designed for individuals who enjoy hot or cold beverages on the go. It combines functionality with a playful design, appealing to a wide range of users, from outdoor enthusiasts to daily commuters. The flask aims to provide a reliable and stylish way to keep drinks at the desired temperature for extended periods, making it a sought-after accessory for those seeking convenience and personalization in their beverage consumption.

## Key features Analysis

The Monkey Flask boasts several features designed for optimal performance and user satisfaction.

**Double-Walled Vacuum Insulation:** This feature is crucial for maintaining the temperature of both hot and cold beverages. the double-walled construction creates a vacuum between the inner and outer layers, minimizing heat transfer by conduction, convection, and radiation. This results in considerably longer periods of hot or cold retention compared to single-walled containers.By using vacuum insulation, the Monkey Flask can keep beverages hot for up to 12 hours and cold for up to 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and the initial temperature of the liquid.

**High-Quality stainless Steel Construction:** The flask is primarily made from food-grade 18/8 stainless steel, which is known for its durability, corrosion resistance, and odor neutrality. This material ensures that the taste of the beverage is not altered and that the flask can withstand daily wear and tear.

This stainless steel construction also makes the flask easy to clean and less prone to bacterial growth, contributing to a healthier drinking experience.

**Leak-Proof and Spill-Proof Design:** The monkey Flask incorporates a secure lid design with silicone seals that prevent leaks and spills, even when the flask is tilted or inverted.This is particularly important for users who carry the flask in a backpack or bag.

The lid is designed to create a tight seal, ensuring that there are no accidental leaks or dribbles, providing peace of mind during transport.

**Wide Mouth Opening:** The flask features a wide mouth opening, making it easy to fill with ice cubes, add fruit infusions, or clean thoroughly.This design is more convenient compared to flasks with narrow openings, which can be challenging to access.

The wide mouth also allows for easy pouring and drinking directly from the flask without spilling, providing added convenience for users on the move.

**Powder-Coated Exterior:** The exterior of the Monkey Flask is often finished with a powder coating, which provides a durable and stylish finish. The powder coating is scratch-resistant and provides a comfortable grip, enhancing the user experience.

This coating also comes in a variety of colors and designs, allowing users to choose a flask that reflects their personal style.

## Core Benefits

The Monkey Flask offers numerous practical benefits that cater to the needs of its users.

**Maintained Beverage Temperature:** The primary benefit of the Monkey Flask is its ability to keep beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods.Whether it's a hot coffee on a cold morning or an ice-cold water on a hot summer day, the flask ensures that your drink stays at the ideal temperature for hours.

This is particularly useful for long commutes, outdoor activities, or situations where access to temperature-controlled beverages is limited.**Reduced Environmental Impact:** By using a reusable flask, users can significantly reduce their consumption of disposable plastic bottles and paper cups. this helps minimize waste and reduces the environmental impact associated with single-use beverage containers.

Users contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle by opting for the Monkey Flask, reducing their carbon footprint and helping to protect the surroundings.

**Cost Savings:** Over time, using a reusable flask like the Monkey Flask can result in significant cost savings compared to purchasing beverages from cafes or stores. The initial investment in the flask is offset by the money saved on disposable cups and bottles.

This is especially true for individuals who regularly purchase coffee, tea, or bottled water, with potential savings accumulating over months and years.

**Convenient and Portable:** The Monkey Flask is designed to be easily carried and used in various settings. Its compact size and lightweight construction make it ideal for commuting,traveling,or engaging in outdoor activities.

It fits comfortably in most cup holders and backpack pockets, making it a convenient companion for anyone on the go.

## FAQs Section

**Is the Monkey Flask dishwasher safe?**
While some components of the monkey flask may be dishwasher safe (such as the lid, depending on the model), it is generally recommended to hand wash the flask body to preserve the quality of the powder coating and insulation. Frequent dishwasher use can possibly damage the exterior finish and reduce the effectiveness of the vacuum insulation over time.

**How do I clean the Monkey Flask effectively?**
To clean the Monkey Flask effectively, rinse it with warm, soapy water after each use. For more thorough cleaning, you can use a bottle brush to scrub the interior.You can also use a mixture of baking soda and water to remove stubborn stains or odors. Ensure that you rinse the flask thoroughly with clean water before using it again.

**What size Monkey Flask is best for me?**
The best size Monkey flask for you depends on your individual needs and preferences. If you typically drink smaller amounts of beverages or need a flask that is easy to carry, a smaller capacity (e.g., 12-16 ounces) might potentially be sufficient. For those who need to stay hydrated throughout the day or prefer larger servings, a larger capacity (e.g., 20-32 ounces) may be more suitable. Consider your daily beverage consumption habits and the portability requirements to determine the ideal size.## Competitor Comparison

Sometimes I feel like I’m just floating through the days, keeping busy, doing what needs to be done, but missing that feeling of being truly heard or understood. I'm not necessarily looking for anything complicated. Just a friend. Someone who actually listens, someone I can be real with. We don’t have to talk all day or every day.

After a failed Stim and an am of 2, and a bunch of other stuff. My doctor finally decided to put me on hydrocortisone. We have started a low-dose of 5 mg in the morning and 2.5 in the afternoon. Prior to diagnosis I was lucky if I could stay up past 7 PM at night and would have a terrifically horrible day. I noticed recently that I’ve had almost too much energy and I’ve had to move my doses around a little to try to find the sweet spot. I don’t want for too much energy to eventually spiral into anxiety, which sort of seems  to be part of the whole SAI .
The past two days only on the 5 mg in the morning I have been feeling a bit wired and then this morning at 3 AM. I woke up with a horrible gut ache, heartburn, and nausea and decided to dose then. To be honest, the wirey feeling feels like almost too many cups of coffee or something, but then if I don’t take it, the day is difficult . It feels like this is such a balancing act and I’m not quite sure what’s coming first ,the chicken or the egg. Any suggestions?  The stomach ache this morning was a mixture of heartburn and nausea. I took a Zofran,hydrocortisone and some omeprazole. I’ll see how I feel in a few hours.

I slipped under the surface. It was nearly pitch black with only the faintest light above and a vague sense of gravity that allowed me to keep my bearings. I blindly swam in what I hoped was an arc so I could get around to the scorpion’s side. I tried my best to swim calmly with minimal motion because I knew the scorpion was sensitive to vibrations. I could only hope that it found being in the water confusing enough to lose me. Not sensing the creature’s legs moving near me, I quietly surfaced.

The papa scorpion was a few meters away, floating, waiting. It was as large as a speedboat. Luckily, it was facing slightly away from me.

I very slowly drifted closer. I had to try to make as little motion as possible, but also not take too long. The scorpion was going to head for shore soon enough if I wasn’t around to tempt it.

Even as I thought that, the thing decided it had had enough. It started swimming toward shore, awkward and slow, but getting away.

I kicked into gear, side swimming with the spear in hand. I got crazy close, the scorpion either not noticing me or ignoring me. Coming to a stop, I lifted the spear and stabbed the beast’s rear-most leg. I tried to jam the bronze tip into the joint, tried to hurt and cut off the limb.

The scorpion ignored me for a moment, but the pain must have been too much. It tried to turn in place. Giant pincers caused waves as they hit the water.

I tried to swim in step with it so we both circled at the same speed while I continued to stab. But the scorpion was turning faster than I could swim. It was also hard to avoid the legs from gutting me at that range. Desperate, I took a deep breath and dove deep again.

I was in rough shape. Tired, wounded all over, my shoulder still badly bleeding. It was so quiet in the water, so dark, I almost wanted to sleep. I knew that was a bad sign. But still, I waited for the vibrations in the water overhead to slow down.

As they did, the scorpion going into drift mode again, my lungs burning for air, I allowed myself to rise, aiming to the side so I didn’t come up under the scorpion’s belly. My head broke the surface. I could just make out the tail overhead. Perfect.

I reached up and hooked the spear around the tail, then kicked higher out of the water to get my arm around it too.

The scorpion did *not* like that. Unfortunately for it, its first reaction was to curl its tail, which pulled me further up out of the water. Pushing through the pain of my broken hand and cut shoulder, I tried to get both arms around the tail, then somehow managed to climb onto the scorpion’s back!

I almost laughed in triumph!

The scorpion flailed with legs and pincers, spinning in place, furiously trying to get me off.

On my knees, I lifted the spear high. No badass Hollywood line came to me to make me sound cool, so I just plunged the spear down, aiming the bronze tip at the joint between two plates.

It clanged like I’d struck metal.

I blinked in surprise. Unable to believe what had just happened, I tried again, harder. Again and again. Turned out the scorpion was the tank. Its armour was completely impenetrable. I was screwed.

There’s a fable about a situation similar to this. A scorpion convinces a frog to give it a ride across a river. The frog is doubtful, but the scorpion promises that it won’t sting the frog. The frog agrees to trust the arachnid, and the scorpion climbs on the frog’s back. Halfway across the river, the scorpion stings the frog, poisoning it, and the pair begin to drown. The frog asks why the scorpion did it; they were both going to die. The scorpion replied that it just couldn’t help it. That was its nature.

This time, it was a human riding on a scorpion’s back. The scorpion did what scorpions do.

As I knelt in astonishment at my failure, staring at the utter lack of damage my spear had done, the scorpion stung me. The tail uncurled, then curled back faster than I could see. The crystal stinger nailed me right in the back of the head. I swear I felt my own skull crack like a ripe melon.

A bright white light filled my vision. My whole body went limp. I slumped to the scorpion’s back, then slipped off and into the water.

Paralyzed, it was like an out-of-body experience. I vaguely watched myself sinking into the water with the stars above, and then the stars were gone, and I was enveloped in warm liquid, slowly drifting downward.

I was so tired. My eyes drifted closed. Distantly, I realized that this was it, the end. I knew it because I’d been through this same thing before. It wasn’t the first time I’d died. This would be the second. That was fine. I didn’t even care if I was sent to yet another world. Actually, I didn’t want that. I didn’t want anything anymore. I was so sick of living.

I was sick of the way my father had always made me feel like a failure. I was sick of my sister treating me like I was scum. Sick of trying to make my way in the world, only to have my dream’s crapped all over while others who were good looking or smarter or who came from a rich family got ahead so easily. I was sick of the fact that, no matter how hard I worked in life, I was never getting ahead. Meanwhile, billionaires got richer every day, even during the pandemic when half the world shut down, making more money they didn’t even need while I had always barely stayed afloat.

Cerise was the best thing that had ever happened to me. It had been like winning the lottery. For some reason, this beautiful, kind, generous woman had seen something in me. She’d agreed to give me a chance, and somehow, I hadn’t blown it. We’d gone for coffee the first time, which had gone so well that we’d gone for a stroll in the park after. Against all odds, despite my sweating up a storm in nervousness, we’d ended up going so far as to hold hands. Because I’d managed to find the courage to reach out and take hers, which at the time had felt like the bravest thing I’d ever done.

Hand in hand, we’d strolled through the rose garden, which had just been coming into bloom. Minutes had passed, yet she hadn’t let me go, hadn’t tried to put distance between us. She’d kept smiling at me as if she’d been having fun, like she’d been enjoying my company, which had seemed so odd. After, I’d barely remembered the roses or what I’d said because I’d been so caught up in the fact that we’d been holding hands and she was just the best woman I’d ever come across.

Maybe folks would laugh if they heard that, mock the love at first sight thing, but something between us just naturally clicked. It was like two puzzle pieces finding their match and fitting together with no effort at all.

I’d cried like a baby when she’d later gotten sick. Not because I was scared of losing her, but because I was scared for her losing out on the life she should have had ahead of her. She was Cerise, the strong one, so she tried to tough it out. Fought back. She made me promise that we’d never give up on each other or ourselves, no matter how hard things got. Maybe that’s why she ultimately beat it.

It had been a hard journey, but she’d survived. I’d promised again, just like I had on our wedding day, that I’d dedicate my life to her. To make the most of the time we had. Things had been fine after that. We’d moved on. Been happy. Life had been perfect and only getting better.

A few years later, some evil piece of shit had invaded our house and murdered Cerise.

That had broken me. I’d never been able to heal from it. I’d loved her too much.

That moment in the desert earlier hadn’t been the first time I’d contemplated suicide. Far from it. For a long time, every single day had required a concentrated effort to keep going, a conscious choice where I’d said every single morning after waking up, “I’m going to live today. One more day.” Most days, that had been a hard promise to make.

Only three things had kept me from entirely giving up. One was Mom. I couldn’t hurt her by killing myself. I couldn’t let her live her last years with the loss of a child. I loved her too much to do that to her. The second was Cerise. She’d loved me, agreed to spend her entire life with me. How could I possibly throw that life away, even if she wasn’t there to share it with me? It was a life she’d valued enough to dedicate herself to. So as much as it hurt, my life was precious, or had been. Throwing it away would be betraying her. I refused to do that. I loved her too much.

But some days, it was damn hard to choose to live. Like the days when you’re really tired or depressed. Or when you’ve spent the last month being tortured by a hostile world you never asked to come to, beaten up in just about every way imaginable. The head wound had to be fatal. I was still seeing a weird white light in my vision even though my eyes were still closed. The many wounds all over my body were beginning to hurt again. My chest ached from a lack of oxygen. I knew I needed to surface and breathe. But moving at all seemed to require too much effort. My body was telling me that this was it, it was time to give up. Not like I was going to survive a cracked skull anyway. Why fight it for a few more seconds?

Cerise had never given up when she’d gotten sick. She’d fought it the entire time, tooth and nail, no matter how bad it had gotten.

I’d promised to be someone she could be proud of. That meant fighting too. With that understanding, I opened my eyes. And I saw the sign.

In my blurry vision, white light swimming in front of me, I saw Cerise looking back at me. She held out her little pinky, just like she had that day at the hospital before surgery. I saw her mouth the words, *We’ll never give up. No matter how hard it gets. Promise.*

I’d promised.

I reached out now in the water with my hand, pinkie out.

The vision of Cerise smiled. It was so beautiful. It broke my heart all over again for how much I loved and missed her. And then she faded away.

I was alone again. I let out a single laugh, a precious bubble of air escaping. Even when she wasn’t there, Cerise could still drag me up and out of my worst moments. But more was needed. I had to get myself out of this mess. Dammit, life could be demanding. With that understanding, I smiled.

I could feel the muck of the oasis bottom under my toes as I hung in the water. That damn, white blotch of light in my vision was still there, along with a splitting headache. Weirdly, though, I could kind of see the white outlining the bronze spearhead. It was resting on the bottom next to me. Smiling wider at my luck, I reached down and grabbed it.

I planted my feet on the bottom of the pool, gripped the spear in both hands, one bruised and one broken. Then I pushed off as hard as I could. I shot straight up, legs kicking fast, arms tensed. I let out a scream of defiance, and bubbles of air streamed away. The white light in my vision seemed to grow more and more intense, probably as I was giving myself brain damage from all the effort. And then I felt the churning of the scorpion’s legs in the water over my head. I lifted the spear with everything I had — and drove it right into the belly of the beast. It sank in deep.

The scorpion kicked about in agony. Long, sharp legs sliced through the water and then through me, tearing me to ribbons.

But I didn’t care. Didn’t stop. I withdrew the spear and stabbed upward over and over, driving that bronze spearhead into the thing’s guts and hopefully its heart. I stabbed and stabbed until my arms were so weak from lack of oxygen that they dropped to my side. The spear slipped from my grasp and sank to the bottom of the oasis. For some reason, the light seemed to go with it, and my vision became normal.

Feebly, I kicked away from the scorpion. It vaguely seemed to be fighting less. I didn’t care. I was done with it. I needed air. I got my head above water and inhaled. It took all my last reserves to just float on my back and breathe.

The scorpion’s motions grew weaker. Desperately, it tried to swim to shore.

I let it go. I didn’t care if it lived or died. If it fled, I hoped it would crawl back into that cave and stay there. Didn’t matter. All I could do was float and stare up at the stars. I was bleeding to death.

Some time later, I started making small motions with my arms, gently drifting back to the shore. It took a while, but I did it. I felt the sand rising under me and allowed myself to rest on the bottom with my head above the water. I stayed that way for some time. I could feel my body growing cold from blood loss. Finally, I grunted and turned over onto all fours so I could make the effort to get out of the water.

The scorpion had made it to shore too. Mostly. One pincer touched dry land while the rest of the body was in the water. Even as I watched, the big guy shivered once, twitched, then all its legs curled up the same way a dead spider’s does. It tipped onto its side and died. In the water. My only water source.

I stared at the massive corpse that I couldn’t possibly move alone, now polluting the oasis.

I punched the wet sand and swore, “Fuck!” A second later, I remembered that I was about to bleed to death, so it didn’t matter. I crawled about a meter up onto dry land and collapsed, flopping onto my back.

Then the system kicked in.

The level-ups rained down like precious jewels.

And if you're hunting for a fridge under ₹25K–₹28K that doesn’t scream “rental kitchen,” read on.

Let’s get into what works, what doesn’t, and why this may actually be the *perfect fridge* for you ... even though I didn’t end up buying it myself.

#  First Impressions: Looks That Don’t Scream Budget

* The **Moon Silver** finish? Clean, subtle, and honestly makes the fridge look more expensive than it is.
* The **bottom-mounted freezer** is a *game-changer* if you’re tired of bending down every time you want dal or leftover pizza.
* **237L capacity** is good enough for a small family (2–3 members), bachelors, or even couples who meal-prep a lot.

# Features That Made Me Go “Wait, What? At This Price?”

* **8-in-1 convertible modes**: You can tweak how the fridge/freezer space works based on your needs ... like vacation mode, home alone mode, etc. Perfect if your usage keeps changing.
* **Turbo Icing**: Freezes ice faster. Super helpful when you’ve got guests over or you're just impatient like me.
* **2 Star Energy Rating**: Not the best, tbh. If energy saving is a top priority, you may want to stretch your budget and look for a 3-5 star model.
* **Toughened glass shelves** and **vegetable crispers** do their job decently ... nothing fancy, but not flimsy either.

# The Real Reason I Didn’t Buy It

Honestly? I needed **more space** and **a higher energy rating** ... because my fridge runs 24/7 and my bill cries monthly.

But if that’s *not* a concern for you and you’re looking for an affordable, low-maintenance, stylish fridge with *just enough smart features*, this is a solid contender.

# Should You Buy It?

**YES**, if:

* You want a **budget-friendly convertible fridge** that doesn’t compromise on aesthetics.
* You prefer **bottom-mounted designs** that reduce back strain.
* You’re okay with a **2-star rating** to save upfront cost.

**Maybe skip**, if:

* You’re a big family or bulk-stocker.
* Power savings and energy bills matter a *lot* to you.
* You want fancy stuff like a digital display or smart controls.

# Check Current Price & Deals

Prices keep playing hide and seek (classic Amazon), but it usually stays between ₹25,000–₹28,000. During sales, it can drop lower!

I normally decant  2 x 200g bags of ground coffee into a canister to mix the decaf and regular, so i dont care very much if it's stale etc. 
Kmart grinder reviews all say its good for weed - so maybe not the best for coffee. Lol
Any hot tips pretty please?
Thank you for coming on my coffee journey with me!

Tinkered with a smart home gadget until 2 a.m., accidentally setting off the smoke alarm (twice) in the process? Welcome to r/TechNestLabsA—a space where the real tech magic isn’t in the perfect projects, but in the messy, frustrating, human journey of making stuff work (or, let’s be honest, making it break spectacularly).​This isn’t a club for developers with error-free repos or engineers who build robots that fold laundry and recite Shakespeare (though if you’ve cracked the code to stop your printer from eating paper? Spill it). It’s for the person who tried to 3D-print a phone stand and ended up with a lopsided blob that looks like a melted alien. The hobbyist who spent a weekend setting up a home server, only to forget the password five minutes later (and wrote it on a sticky note that’s now hiding under a pile of old USB drives). The curious soul who downloaded a coding tutorial, got stuck on “Hello World,” and thought, “Maybe I should just stick to using emojis.”​Share your “aha!” and “oh no” moments: “Finally got my Raspberry Pi to control my bedroom lights! It flickers like a haunted house, but I did it.” Ask for help with the head-scratchers: “Why does my smart thermostat keep switching to ‘eco mode’ at 3 a.m.? Is it plotting against me? Should I name it Skynet?” Celebrate the small wins: “Fixed my laptop’s wonky trackpad with a piece of tape and a prayer. Tech support who?”​We get it. Tech is equal parts genius and chaos. Like when you spent weeks building a DIY drone, only to watch it crash into a tree 30 seconds into its first flight (RIP, little flyer). Or when you tried to automate your coffee maker and accidentally programmed it to brew 12 cups at midnight (but called it “midnight motivation fuel”). But those are the moments that make your tech journey yours—glitchy code, duct-taped prototypes, and all.​Grab your soldering iron (and maybe a backup hard drive, just in case). Let’s swap stories about the time you mistook a HDMI cable for a USB-C (and wondered why nothing worked) or forgot to save your project before your laptop died (never again… until next time). Here, the more chaotic the process, the louder we cheer. Because in the end, it’s not about perfect tech—it’s about the joy of trying, learning, and laughing when it all goes sideways.",1,1753867596.0,TechNestLabsA,0,1.0,False

First off, I will not go into the balance sheets in this post, but focus on something else. Let’s look at Gamestop and what they are known for and what they are pivoting towards \**insert Silicon Valley Pivot Meme*\*.

**Gamestop’s legacy (GME)** – Gamestop is known by gaming enthusiasts, mostly the older online generation. People used to buy games and gaming gear in Gamestop’s physical shops. You could play a game and then trade it in for cash toward a new game, even though they really ripped you off—going in with a game worth $40–60 and getting $5 if you were lucky.

Gamestop slowly declined into a descent to hell and oblivion when digital games took over. People no longer needed physical copies, and it was easier to just buy games in online stores like Valve or PlayStation. Gamestop was a dying business.

**2021 and the Father of Memestocks** – In late 2020 and early 2021, everyone had eyes on the financial world and Wall Street—all because of a bunch of retail investors and a man with a red ribbon around his head. Gamestop went from just a couple of dollars to $500 pre-market. The buy button got disabled by Robinhood and… yeah, the rest you all know.

But out of the ashes, a guy named Ryan Cohen emerged as a board member and later CEO of Gamestop. He had previously outperformed Amazon and others in the pet food business, making Chewy a billion-dollar company.

Gamestop had another enormous spike in June 2024 when the stock price went from $10 to $80. It’s like the chart wants to explode but something is holding it in place—shorting and many other shenanigans we won’t dive into here.

**Gamestop today** – Fast-forward from the crazes of 2021 and 2024, and Gamestop is now a whole different business—at least for the most part. They still sell some gaming gear, but they have shifted toward “Collectibles.”

Collectibles include TCG, sports cards, figurines, and much more.

Gamestop has amassed an insane amount of cash. They’re sitting at around 60% cash on hand (conservatively) out of their total market cap of $10 billion. If you include their ATM offerings for crypto treasury purchases, they’re more realistically at 87–90% cash on hand versus their market cap. That’s around $9 billion in cash. They have closed basically every shop in the world except in the US. There's only a very few in the rest of the world. They did this to cut costs significantly.

They’ve acquired around 4,700 BTC as a hedge against inflation and money printing as well, spending around $500 million acquiring it.

Ryan Cohen and the rest of the team (some of them from Chewy) are taking 0% salary and have their own money invested in the company. Tell me how many companies do the exact same thing…

**Is collectibles a big market?** Oh yes. Collectibles have been attractive for many generations, and both young and old people collect all sorts of things for either personal fun or to sell for more in the future.

**The Landscape of Collectibles** – Collecting cards is a great hobby and investment, but it can be tedious and require a decent amount of effort.

If you buy a card for investment purposes, you have to instantly put it into a plastic slab and store it properly—away from too much sunlight, humidity, etc. You have to make sure it’s tucked away safe and sound.

If you want to sell the card, you have to handpick which cards have value, go to a store, ask for grading, wait for grading to be done, pick them up again, and then sell on eBay.

That was… at least the old way to do it, and still is in many cases.

But now Gamestop has all this available as a service in their store. It’s a one-stop shop—you don’t have to fiddle with grading services or list cards on eBay yourself. You just go to Gamestop, hand in the cards, and they do the rest. They even offer to sell them for you right there in the shop.

**Social media and tendencies** – The internet, social media in particular, has so much content on everything. There is also a very big fanbase for collectible content.

So-called “breakers” are people who buy a pack of cards (e.g., Pokémon) and open them on stream or video—that’s the content. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s like “unboxing” content but with collectibles.

Unboxing, you say? Oh… that makes me think of Counter-Strike and the skin boxes they sell. It reminds me of FIFA player packs. It reminds me of dopamine rushes with the click of a button—much like gambling, which has seen an immense boost on social media. People literally make videos of themselves going to a shop, grabbing a coffee, sitting in their car, and gambling live on some generic site that’s basically just a black screen with two buttons. Then they lose or win, say “see you next time,” and people wait for new content.

That’s literally the content, and it is straight-up tragic brain-rot material (as young people call it).

That tendency I don’t really like or support, but I mention it here because it will make sense later on. Pokémon is basically a form of gambling embraced by parents all over the world—because they don’t bat an eye if their kid asks for a Pokémon pack, but they’d lose their mind if the kid asked for $15 to spin a roulette wheel.

Oh well—the world works in strange ways.

EA Games in 2021 earned $1.6 billion on FIFA player packs alone. Those players can’t be used in the next version of FIFA, so it’s essentially money out the window.

Counter-Strike sells skins that can be traded and collected just like cards, so it’s different from FIFA. And Valve earns insane amounts of money from this too.

**Gamestop’s new PowerPlay (PowerPacks)** – Now to the game-changer.

If you don’t want to deal with all the hassle of protecting your cards, and you don’t want to eBay every single card yourself, and you don’t want to throw money away on useless gambling or skins for games that reset every year, then there is now a new option!

Gamestop launched a **BETA version** of its “Push Start Arcade” (Abbreviation; PSA—also the name of a major card-grading company they partnered with earlier this year).

You can now get verified and professionally graded collectible cards instantly, with a click of a button.

You can scratch the itch of throwing dumb money on dumb gambling and skins—and instead throw that dumb money toward a possible investment with future profit potential. Even if YOU don't do that, there is no denying that a lot of people do this, and that it's a huge market. 

You can even have Gamestop/PSA store your card for you in a secure, safe and insured facility, until you want to sell it for a potential increase in value.

Or they’ll offer to buy the card for a 10% cut + 6% trading fee instantly after you pull the card, or sell it for you on eBay via auction for just 6%.

**The barrier of entry just got almost completely removed for trading-card collecting.**

This is just a beta version—it doesn’t even include golf cards, baseball, NBA, soccer, hockey, Magic The Gathering, action figures/figurines, comic books and so forth.I haven't even talked about expansions and future features of all of this, but that's for another post. Now let's enjoy the beta-version for a second.

**TL;DR:** Collecting cards just got 1000% easier. You can now buy, hold, or sell trading cards with the click of a button—just like opening skin boxes, player packs, or gambling. But this is like an investment-gamble. Here you can see how it works so far: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82RfUyLeH1g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82RfUyLeH1g)

It's never to communicate or connect or find out what's true, it's always to manipulate and get things they want.

Not one person sincerely believes Israel isn't starving Gaza. Everyone knows it is, including the people who are saying it isn't. They're just throwing a bunch of language at it in an effort to keep the west supporting Israel's genocide.

Israel's official Twitter account is currently trying to claim that a photo of a dead skeletal man proves people are sharing disinformation about Israel, because it turns out the man had diabetes. It's a well-documented fact that first people to die in a famine are always children and people with health problems, and yet the main hasbara arguments today are ""Why is it always the children dying and not the healthy adults?"" and ""This person already had health problems!""

Just a few minutes ago I had someone on Twitter show me pictures which they claim shows Gaza is not currently starving, and the pictures were from the West Bank. 

Before that another hasbarist responded to footage I shared of far right Israelis blocking aid trucks into Gaza saying, ""the trucks have been stopped because they are full of weapons heading to Hamas."" When I called him out for lying he said ""why not? you all take AI produced photos and videos and run on the narrative that they are real."" Neither of these statements are true. He knew he was lying, and he didn't care.

These are just some things I've seen on my screen here this morning before coffee. 

They do this all the time. They lie and lie and lie and lie and lie. They are not normal people. They do not use language the same way normal people do.

Which should come as no surprise to anyone. If you'd support a genocide, of course you'd be willing to lie in order to justify it. If your moral line isn't drawn before genocide, of course it's not going to be drawn before lying either.",0,1753867340.0,IsraelPalestine,26,0.36,False

Boy howdy, what a difference it makes to stay hydrated.

I cleaned my bathroom ceiling, reorganized a cupboard in my kitchen, threw out old coffee that had long since been forgotten.

What a game changer. 

For a long time I would think, ""how do people have the energy to do x, y, or z"" and it turns out, maintaining your body is a great way to sustain energy levels. Eating good food in moderation, and getting plenty of water on the daily.

It had the specs, the look, the features...basically everything you'd want in a smart mid-sized fridge.  
I almost clicked “Buy Now.”

But here’s the plot twist: I didn’t end up buying it.  
Not because it was bad ... but because **my use-case was different**.

And if you're someone living in a nuclear family, or you just want a solid fridge that’s flexible, energy-efficient, and doesn’t look cheap...you *should* seriously consider this one.

[Want to peek inside your future fridge? Click here.](https://www.amazon.in/Haier-Inverter-Refrigerator-HEF-333TS-P-Convertible/dp/B0BTHK3R9D/ref=sr_1_16?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

Here’s my full take after obsessively researching it for days.

# It had almost everything I was looking for —

✅ 10-in-1 convertible modes (because we all hoard leftovers)

✅ Triple inverter + dual fan tech for better cooling balance

✅ Bottom freezer design (no more back-breaking veg hunts)

✅ Inox steel finish = sleek and classy

✅ Decent 3-star energy rating

✅ Price range: ₹32,000–₹36,000 (subject to offers)

# So why didn’t I buy it?

Purely size.

I needed something slightly *bigger* for my joint family kitchen chaos. This 328L beauty is perfect for nuclear families or couples ... not for a household where five people fight over fridge real estate.

But that doesn't mean it’s not worth your attention.

# Why You Should Buy It?

* **Space Smart:** 328L with intelligent layout ... the freezer doesn’t hog all the space.
* **Energy Efficient:** Triple inverter tech adjusts cooling as per load = lower bills.
* **Versatility Goals:** 10 conversion modes ... turn the freezer into fridge, adjust based on seasons, or when guests arrive unannounced.
* **Low Noise, Fast Cooling:** Dual fan keeps the airflow even. Great if you hate warm spots in your fridge.
* **Design:** Looks way more premium than its price. Think matte steel vibes.

# The Bottom Line?

If you're a small family or living with flatmates and want something *smart, spacious,* and *budget-conscious*, this is a serious contender. Honestly, if I didn’t need 355+ litres, I would’ve gone for this one.

----

The airspace is only available for Korean planes, and there's only one air company named Air Koryo. We were flying on an old Tu-154, and the ventilation didn't work on ground, so the cabin was basically a sauna. The patriotic songs were played loudly during the flight. Flights are made by air company Nordwind, and the first ever plane from Russia to North Korea landed there two days ago. There are only montly flights, so they're likely not really aimed for tourists, but for workers.
 
Surprisingly, the airport had a business class lounge. Although inside the only ""business class"" stuff is a fridge with water bottles and a muffin bowl. You can't go there unless you have the ""VIP-ticket"", whatever this is, and there were no visitors at all.
 
Only Russia and China citizens can enter the country. Tourists can only travel in organized groups, and only Russian tourists are allowed. Some people from the both countries come here for work. I saw a couple of them, and they were heading to cities far from the capital. The visa is single-entry only for the duration of stay. Only 1200 people visit North Korea each year.
 
You have to fill a customs declaration on entry. Tech stuff over $10k is prohibited. One guy tried to pass with a super expensive camera lens, and he was forced to leave it in the airport for storage with the pretext of exceeding the cost. Customs officers didn't ask to unlock the phones and tablets, they didn't connect them to their PCs, although they did ask to show the phones without cases to see the logo on the backside (they were comparing it to the declaration). They were concerned when they saw our USB flash drive on the X-ray. There were a lot of USB adapters connected to the drive, but after due explaining they let us pass. Mobile phones don't connect to any of the local networks, the whole time in the country we had no connection at all. When you move out you don't have to fill any declarations or show any of your stuff.
 
The travel agency said that 85% of our group would be old people nostalgic about USSR, 10% would be bloggers, trying to film something interesting, and 5% would be young people that are impressed by North Korean hackers, trying to see how do they live here. We were surprised to see that most of the people in our group were experienced travelers who have some knowledge about this country and its regime, wanting to compare it to other countries and get their own impression of it.
 
Our group was followed by 5 people: a guide who could speak Russian, two guides who couldn't, and two assistants. Wandering off is prohibited: senior guide goes in front of the group, another two guides go closely behind, and assistants go from the sides. If you try to step a couple meters aside from the route, the assistants say ""you can't go there, come back here"". Sometimes when we tried to film something they said ""you can't film it"". The restaurants, the museums, the memorials – everything is closed for special service and isolated from the locals. After our group was brought to hotel, the porter locked the door with his key. The next evening some people went outside to have a cigarette, but the guides went outside with them: one was smoking too, other were keeping people from wandering away from the hotel.
 
The hotel lobby was pretty neat. Interior looks like it's from 1960s. Lifts look like old japanese ones. All the rooms are for smokers, and they're soaked with the smoke smell. The only requirement is to not smoke in the bed. The toilet in the bathroom is american, as well as the power sockets (although they may be japanese, idk). On the top floor there was a restaurant. The windows there are panoramic, but 1/3 of them are closed, we couldn't look there. Wikimapia shows that there's a bunker somewhere in that direction.
 
The breakfast is like in a three-star hotel: a bun, a cabbage salad, kimchi, smoked fish, fried eggs and coffee. The dishes were cold. The milk for coffee was powdered and not regular liquid one.
 
According to rumors, our rooms were listened 24/7. There was a whole floor for employees. One brave fella asked the guide: ""Is it true that you have a floor for wiretapping officers there?"". He answered with pokerface: ""There's no such floor"". Another tourist then jokingly said: ""But we went there by stairs"", and the guide answered: ""It's impossible, you can't just get there"".
 
There was no TV or radio. Anywhere. Not in hotel, not somewhere else. We couldn't see the media the locals see. The only information source were the newspapers from the stands, and they've only been placed on the metro stations, not on the street. The newspaper in english with partially colored print were given to us on the plane, but they took it back later. The local newspaper is in black and white, and the paper quality is low. The newspaper for foreigners said something like ""We grew even more war power"", the local one – something like ""The respected leader opened the new greenhouse"" or ""Our farmers have harvested even more rice"".
 
Taking pictures from height is prohibited, because you can see the city layout. Taking pictures of the metro scheme is prohibited as well. Taking pictures of construction sites in the city is prohibited too. My guess is that's because 90% of them are frozen: the cranes don't move, there are no people, and by comparing the pictures from different years you could see that the construction sites are basically abandoned. You get the apartment for your merits for the party (the main requirement is working in one place for 40 years). You can't choose where your apartment will be. There are no single houses, only apartments. The class of your apartment depends on how much you did for the party.
 
We saw a lot of ceremonies: in the city people walk in columns in the morning to see the flag raising, in the fields they go in columns to work. Everyone have the party badges. On the badges – two of the dead leaders: Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong Il. The badges are sacred: we tried to get some for the collecting purposes, but the guides wouldn't gift or sell them. We only saw one hobo-looking guy without the badge. All the achievements are connected to the leaders, i.e.: ""Our leader once walked here and told us to plant flowers here"". When the leaders are mentioned, people always use servile words like ""honourable comrade"", with their eyes subserviently shining and their voice being truly ecstatic. Very often we could hear about N. Korean achievements in a context of ""excellence over capitalistic states"".
 
If we take a picture of something with the leaders, like a monument, the rules are very strict: no cropping (the leaders must be standing in their full height), no selfies. If you want to have a shot of yourself by the leader, you must be standing at attention. Smiling during photo is prohibited. The monuments and images are sacred. Note that almost all of the traditional Korean churches are destroyed.
 
Since 5 AM on the outside the music is being played from the speakers. It's loud, and it wakes people up: it's time to go to work! The tourists are settled on the hotel's top floors (30+), but the music is clearly heard from there.
 
The school education lasts for 12 years and is free. Then a citizen can go to army, university, or to factory or farm. The salary is assigned by government. The most highly-paid jobs are doctors, teachers, and engineers. Pension is being paid after a citizen reaches 55/60 years (women/men; physical labor) or 58/63 years (women/men; non-physical labor, like in office).
 
Marriage requires parents' agreement. If a guy or a girl can't find themselves a partner, the parents find it. The groom's family gifts a ring, the bride's – a watch. Divorce is possible, but rare.
 
It is openly stated that people are sent to labor camps for life if they commit serious crimes.
 
In the city, there are a lot of lifeless buildings (no movement inside, no curtains on the windows, no lights, no furniture inside, etc.) On the first floors of the buildings there are shops sometimes. 98% of them are closed, in 1% of them have someone inside, and 1% are completely empty. We were wondering: how can it be that there's no one in the shop choosing goods or paying for them?
 
During rides to the landmarks outside of Pyongyang, we were mostly traveling by tunnels. Later we realised that these tunnels were laid under small towns. On the one hand, we didn't stop at traffic lights; on the other, we couldn't see other cities aside from the capital. There are very few cars. We mostly saw pretty modern chinese and european models. The cars never give way to pedestrians, not even on the crossings: looks like they're only being driven by party elite, so the regular rabble must step aside. The roads are bad; in fact, max speed on the highway was 70 km/h. There were roadblocks with soldiers. After controlling our passage they saluted to us.
 
In the metro: the cars are pretty similar to those that we had in Moscow in 1950s, but they're a little different. For example, the legs are heated everywhere with hot air. The foreigners were put in a separate car. On the stations the door didn't open for locals.
 
We could see the railroads sometimes. They were all single-track. There were no trains, only one service/repair locomotive.
 
The local beer is truly disgusting, although it's popular booze for locals. The second in popularity is rice vodka with a questionable taste. There was a very bad lager with low percentage (abv 4%) with rotgut notes in taste. There was a restaurant with 8 sorts of the ""best"" beer (yuck!) with differentially proportioned hops, barley, and rice oilcake. They sold the beer to foreigners for $1/bottle. I suppose that locals get it much cheaper.
 
The prices in tourist shops are high, similar to international, like in a duty free zone. Payment – USD cash bills (they don't take coins) and cash yuans.
 
Everyone know or learn by heart the leader's birth day and month, but it's forbidden to know/talk about the leader's age or birth year. Everyone knows that his age will be announced after his death, but before that the leader is forever young. (Right now he's 43 years old.)
 
In a frank conversation, one of the locals said: ""I studied to become an engineer and I did. I started working in that sphere, but then I realised that our tech and science are so backward, that it's just despairing. So I requalified into tourism"".

I'm just the bloke next door with grown up kids and a wife, on the surface we seem fine just like everyone else, but underneath things are not so great. 
The thing is though, we seem to have fallen into taking each other for granted, feeling too comfortable, lack of effort has now pushed way to feeling a little invisible, plus we have older kids who will probably fly the nest within a few years, and so im unsure how we'll navigate just being a couple.

A few things i dont like..  
*One worded responses, going to bed early, cats, twats riding scooters, being out in the cold, crowds of people, being stuck behind slow walking people, cold showers, noisy people in the cinema, dancing.*

They are crucial for removing sediment and oils, resulting in a smoother and more flavorful cup of coffee. The quality and durability of these filters directly impact the overall coffee experience and the efficiency of brewing operations.

## Key Features Analysis

The 23x9 10-gallon coffee filter market offers a diverse range of options, each wiht its own set of features designed to enhance brewing performance and efficiency.

**Filter Paper Material:** the foundation of any good coffee filter is the quality of its paper. Premium filters utilize heavy-weight, high-grade paper specifically designed for coffee brewing. This results in efficient sediment removal, preventing grounds from seeping into the coffee. High-grade paper also resists tearing or bursting under the weight of the coffee grounds and water, especially crucial in a 10-gallon brewing system.**Dimensions and Fit:** A precise fit is essential for optimal performance, guaranteeing the proper seal and preventing coffee grounds from bypassing the filter during brewing. The 23x9 inch measurement refers to the diameter and height dimensions of the filter, meticulously calibrated to match the specifications of compatible commercial coffee makers. Variations, even minor ones, can lead to improper brewing and avoidable spills.

**Wet Strength:** wet strength is the ability of the filter paper to maintain its integrity when saturated with water. High-quality filters feature enhanced wet strength, preventing tearing during the brewing process, especially when handling large volumes of water and coffee grounds commonly found in a 10-gallon brewing process. This ensures all brewed coffee passes cleanly through the filter.

**Seam Construction:** The seams of the filter is what keeps the basket shape and avoid breaking during the brewing process. Reinforced seams are essential for preventing failure. A properly constructed and reinforced seam ensures that the filter stays intact, even under the pressure of a full 10-gallon brew.This reduces the risk of coffee grounds escaping and causing a mess, while also contributing to consistent and well-filtered coffee.

Key features of the best 23x9 10-gallon coffee filters include:

* Durable,high-grade paper
* Accurate dimensions for a secure fit
* Exceptional wet strength to avoid tearing
* Reinforced seam construction

## Core Benefits

Investing in premium 23x9 10-gallon coffee filters translates into several key benefits, impacting both the quality of the coffee and the efficiency of the brewing operation.

**Consistent Coffee Quality:** Premium filters remove sediment and oils effectively, resulting in a cleaner, more enjoyable cup of coffee. Regularly using high-quality filters can substantially reduce the presence of unwanted particles, leading to a smoother taste and a more consistent brewing outcome, which is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction in a high-volume environment.

**Reduced Maintenance:** durable filters minimize the risk of tearing or bursting,reducing the need for frequent cleanup and maintenance of the brewing equipment. Using robust filters also prevents coffee grounds from entering the heating element or other critical components, which can lead to costly repairs or downtime, saving both time and money.

**Enhanced Efficiency:** Accurate dimensions and strong seams ensure a secure fit, preventing coffee grounds from bypassing the filter and optimizing the brewing process. This efficiency means less coffee waste and better extraction, resulting in more coffee per batch. It also contributes to a smoother workflow, allowing baristas and staff to focus on other tasks rather than constantly monitoring the brewing process.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right coffee filter often comes with a number of vital questions for potential buyers.

**Are these filters compatible with all 10-gallon coffee makers?**
No, these filters are designed specifically for coffee makers that require a 23x9 inch filter. ItS always best to check the manufacturer's specifications of your coffee maker to ensure compatibility before purchasing. Using the wrong size filter can lead to messy spills or improper brewing.

**How often should I replace the coffee filter?**
Coffee filters are designed for single use. Each filter should be replaced after every brewing cycle to maintain optimal coffee quality and prevent the buildup of residue. Reusing filters can lead to a decline in taste and hygiene, potentially affecting both customer satisfaction and equipment maintenance.

**What are the environmental considerations of using these filters?**
Many manufacturers offer unbleached or compostable options. These environmentally kind alternatives still provide the same level of filtration while minimizing their ecological footprint. Check product descriptions for certifications or claims regarding sustainability.

Nagesh argued its just one drop and he didnt intend to do it and was sorry but my boss kept on demeaning him. Watchman Nagesh got angry and said ""Creta chalate ho bmw ki akad mat dikhao"" Triggered by this my boss threw a stone with sheer force but it fell way far on the street while Nagesh was standing right in front of him. Boss called up the security manager Gopal and had the watchman nagesh fired. I liked him, He was a good guy. Had he controlled his spit or my boss wouldn't have been such a bitch about 1 ml drop of paan spit, Nagesh would still be working! We then started with our routine and got ample amount of work done! It was a pleasant environment in our office given such a weird morning start. Now, evening is where everything went haywire. I poured myself coffee and stood near a window only to see a big group of people with bats and stuff tryna enter the building. They barged in and asked who was the guy who threw a stone on us in the morning. The security guard said no one but was then asked who was shouting and fighting here. It turns out the stone had hit a little boy on the street who in the evening shared it with his dad or idk something like this. The dad turned out to be some area ka dada and plus it being a locals vs company fight it got to next level. Arjun (my boss) went down to apologize and settle the matter and while he did manage to calm then down and guess what turned they both had mutuals and shit so yeah, It turned into a friendly meet. They were having a chat and he was just explaining what had happened in the morning with the action and suddenly Nagesh with his people came and he exactly saw Arjun in that spot with the throwing action. This time he also saw goons next to him laughing and smiling which triggered him even further. It just erupted after this Nagesh rushed in and hit those goons and personally slapped Arjun and once more spat but this time he spat the entire spit and not just a drop. As Nagesh fled the scene, Yashwant bhai (Little boy stone hit father) and his gang got furious on Arjun stating he ordered goons to hit them and he took advantage of having mutuals and establishing a bond to catch them vulnerable. This is when the cops arrived and took yashwant bhai off the property but while going he has given Arjun sir a threat by saying he won't forget this.  So he is kinda worried of whats gonna happen next.

TLDR :- Boss faught with watchman. Goons come to beat boss but both had mutuals. Watchman comes with his gang but by mistake hits some other gang along with boss. Other gang is also pissed at boss.",20,1753865568.0,IndianWorkplace,5,0.86,False

1md1dvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1md1dvb/seeking_opinions_please_evaluate_my_routine/,Seeking Opinions - Please Evaluate My Routine,"I'm not sure where to start and this is a bit wordy.  Some background:

I'm a male, 53 years-old and for the past six years i've been doing Crossfit five days a week which was very good for me.  I was in my late 40s, fat, and wanting to be more athletic.  Crossfit gave me that.  I learned a lot more about calisthenics as Crossfit incorporates a lot of those concepts into it's programming.  The problem is that I got injured a few times in the past two years, two of which required PT.  Therapists thought that muscle-imbalances were the root cause along with inadequate flexibility.  I began to feel that Crossfit didn't teach this properly.  Also, I don't really care about wild kip swings and double-under jump rope technique.  After six years I still can't double-under and honestly, I don't really care.  It's not important to me.  After my injuries I stopped progressing and I noticed that some people in the class would ignore me which was odd.  They only wanted to be around winners.  I wasn't ""winning"" like I had been.  So this past May I decided to only do bodyweight training and see how it goes.

I'll just mention here that i'm not interested in size.  I don't know why Americans are infatuated with muscle size, that's not me at all.  I want to be lean, strong, mobile, functional.  I want to be so good at moving my own body weight that I can hoist my ass up and over any obstacle.  I want to be military fit.  I do not want to be some hulking NFL linesman.

So, I've mostly been doing a push/pull/lower routine, with lower body usually on my pull days.  I work from home and can do high-volume training throughout the whole day as a result.  I'll get up, foam roll, stretch, then do about 25 push-ups to failure, then work for a bit, then do about 10 pike push-ups (to failure), go back to work, then go outside for 20 burpees or so, work for a bit, then go for a mile walk, work, push-ups and pike push-ups, etc.  I'll walk to a park to do dips where there are parallel bars.  I'm spreading all of the work out over the day.  I can end-up with 125-150 push-ups, 40 or more pike push-ups, usually about 30 dips, 50 burpees.  I'm also doing daily ab work, usually hollow-body holds, woodchoppers and knee-raises from a bar.  Pull days are similar though I have to go into the gym to do those along with bodyweight rows.  Lower body is usually 50-60 squats several times a day, i'll lunge around the house for coffee, bathroom, water, etc along with noridc curls and reverse nordic curls.  I'll continue with burpees and ab work.  I try to do 30-50 pull-ups which right now I can do with a mix of light and intermediate bands.  I can do 1-3 pull-ups with my own weight right now.  I do beginner Spin The Cat movements on the rings on this day as I enjoy that.  Usually Wednesday I run a mile against the clock followed by sprints in an empty parking lot as fast as I can for 10-20 minutes.  I want to do more jump/plyometric training.  Thursday/Friday is generally a repeat of Monday/Tuesday.  I seem to be doing alright, i'm 9 weeks in and I dropped four lbs this past week and am about to go under 200 lbs for the first time in over 10 years.  I'm going to be 54 in September, so i'm happy with the results thus far.  Mos of my injuries seem to be clearing-up and I feel more balanced.  

I guess the questions I have are -

1. Is this sustainable?  Will I burn out on this and can I optimize it?
2. Should I also maybe do barbell back squats on lower-body days?  I'm starting to do a lot of squats, so wondering if using the barbell with weights would be better.  I'm not interested in weights for upper-body.
3. I don't know, am I doing this right and going about this correctly?  I'm also worried about how this might go in winter when it's dark, low-clouds and raining (I live in the Pacific Northwest).  I miss the programming which comes with Crossfit so sort of lost on my own.

You know that feeling — like your work isn’t good enough, like you don’t belong in the space you’re trying to grow into. I must’ve looked discouraged, because a woman at the next table leaned over and said, “Sorry to interrupt, but I saw you writing — you look really focused. I’m a teacher, and I just wanted to say: keep going. Whatever you’re working on, don’t give up. The world needs more voices.”

I was stunned. I didn’t even know her name, and yet that one comment lifted something heavy off my chest. I smiled and thanked her, genuinely. She just nodded and went back to her coffee. It wasn’t a long exchange, but it meant so much. You never really know how much someone’s kind words can impact another person’s day or journey. That moment reminded me that we’re all in this together, even when it feels like we’re alone in the struggle.

If you’ve been waiting for a sign to keep going — this is it. Your voice matters. Your work matters. And there are more people cheering for you than you realize, even if they’re strangers in a coffee shop.

We've been together 10 years. My partners health hasn't always been 100% but when we first met she was in better health. She has hormone issues, thyroid problems, bowl issues, an old sprained ankle, weight issues, knee problems, osteoporosis and other shit. 

My partner doesn't look after herself. She doesnt take all her medication like she should, she doesnt eat well or exercise. Over the years she's gotten worse and she's put on more weight. She's constantly complaining about something but doesnt do anything to help herself. She sprained her ankle but then stopped going to physio and didn't do any of the ankle exercises at home. She has health issues but doesn't speak to a doctor about it, she thinks its all just about her and her feeling shit with her health but I don't think she realises the stress and extra weight this puts on me. 

It's like a domino effect. Because she doesnt look after her health this increases my workload. She would finish work at 4pm and do very little for the rest of the evening. The majority of the housework falls on me, the responsibility of the dog and trying to manage the house, the dog and her health is a lot. 

I'm tired all of the time and sometimes I'd like her to make me a coffee in bed but I cant remember the last time she did that because she always sleeps in. I'd love for her to help me pick up around the house without her being exhausted by 7pm and not wanting to do anything but relax on the sofa. I'd love for her to tell me to stay in bed because she's going to go down and sort the dog. I'd love for her to tell me to jump in the shower and that she's got cleaning the kitchen. I'd love for her to not let things pile up before she decides to do them. She doesnt think about the bigger picture. 

A general day of working, taking the dog for a walk, cooking dinner, cleaning up after dinner, doing a grocery shop or other chore, shouldn't be exhausting her by 6pm where you can't be bothered to entertain the dog, finish the rest of the chores for the day and she just wants to sit down because her feet hurt and ache, she works from home so it's not like she's on her feet all day. This just means that when she's done she's done and she just wants to sit down, so I'll finish the chores, keeping the dog entertained/ trained and won't get to relax until 9.30/10pm when I go to bed. I wake up at 7am, she wakes up at 8.30. My day starts earlier and finishes later. 

I know she's got health issues but I'm struggling with having more and more stress and weight put on me becsuse she doesnt look after herself. I feel like she uses it as a reason as to why she can't do some stuff, it's like it gives her an excuse. There's days where I'm too tired and can't fit in taking a shower because I'm too tired, the chores need doing and working it round our dog.  

I know I sound like a knob because she's struggling with a lot of health issues, but she doesn't do anything to help herself or me. 

Also, our dog is hitting adolescents, thats why he takes up so much effort and need entertaining/ training.

## Key Features Analysis

The importance of a well-stocked and maintained breakroom cannot be overstated. A comfortable and convenient break area contributes significantly to employee satisfaction and can lead to improved performance.**Commercial Grade Coffee Maker**

A high-quality coffee maker specifically designed for commercial use is essential for any breakroom. These units are built to withstand constant use and offer features like large-capacity brewing, programmable timers, and automatic shut-off. We are reviewing models with durable stainless-steel carafes, easy-to-clean components, and warranties covering heavy usage. Commercial grade coffee makers are intended to supply coffee for large teams with minimal maintenance.

**Water filtration System**

Providing access to clean, filtered water is a must-have. Bottleless water coolers with advanced filtration systems offer a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to bottled water. These systems typically utilize multi-stage filtration to remove impurities, chlorine, and odors, resulting in refreshing and healthy drinking water. Look for coolers with hot and cold water dispensing options to cater to different preferences. This encourages hydration and provides an alternative to sugary drinks.

**Microwave Oven with Smart Sensor Technology**

A microwave oven with smart sensor technology takes the guesswork out of reheating food. these microwaves use sensors to detect the moisture content of the food and automatically adjust the cooking time and power level, preventing overcooking or undercooking. Look for models with features like pre-programmed cooking options, child safety locks, and easy-to-clean interiors. This promotes efficient meal times,especially for employees avoiding unhealthy fast food options.

**Stocked Snack and Beverage Vending Machine**

While seemingly simple, offering a variety of snacks and beverages through a vending machine provides accessible options for employees to refuel throughout the day.The best machines feature options for healthier snacks, sugar-free drinks, and energy bars, appealing to a wider range of dietary preferences. Look at newer models with cashless payment options, energy-efficient operation, and remote monitoring to ensure they are always stocked and functioning properly. This limits employee time spent off site in addition to providing alternatives to less healthy snacks.

**Dishwasher and Sink Combo**

Hygiene is paramount, and providing employees with a convenient way to clean their dishes and utensils is crucial. Look for a smaller commercial dishwasher combined with a double-basin sink, complete with dish soap, sponges, and drying racks. This encourages employees to wash their items immediately after use, keeping the breakroom clean and reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. A sanitizing cycle is a critical safety feature to consider.

**Comfortable and Ergonomic Seating**

Often overlooked, providing comfortable and ergonomic seating is crucial for employee well-being. This can include a mix of chairs, couches, and bar-height seating, depending on the available space and employee preferences. Ergonomic chairs with adjustable lumbar support are a great option for longer breaks, while couches and lounge chairs create a more relaxed atmosphere. Consider seating arrangements that promote conversation and collaboration. This simple advancement can greatly impact employee break time enjoyment.

My wife has also secured a better paid position at Specsavers which we are really happy about.

Rent in London got to £2,500 a month for a 3 bedroom house which was crippling, but I had to stay till now to help my daughter finish her GCSEs in the same school. She was doing really well there so didn’t want to disrupt. Until last year we were paying £1,700 in rent which was high but wasn’t burning a hole in my finances. As you can imagine £2,500 was way too much for anyone who is not a billionaire.

Anyway, we are completing on a 4 bedroom townhouse tomorrow in CV2 Carroll Crescent and I would appreciate some info from fellow experienced Coventry dwellers.

What is my area, is it Upper Stoke or Barras Heath?

Is it a family friendly area? (Buying from a family and it looked good when we viewed the property)

Any good shops or Halal restaurants that you would recommend?

What is the best barber shop in town that does appointments? (I hate waiting for 3 hrs for a haircut)

I am a self proclaimed coffee snob, so best coffee shops for speciality coffee?

Local forests for great walks?


Now we are moving we should be saving over a £1,000 a month just on house costs. A relief if you ask me.

Anything else would be great.

I stayed overseas for 3 years due to uni, and you can imagine how a uni student’s diet is like … I barely drank water maybe half a cup each day on rare days I drink 3/4 of those plastic bottles. I drank other fluids e.g. Coke Zero, coffee, tea, juice, soy milk etc and ate fruits (water content from fruits counts I guess). I also snacked a lot on top of my main meals, usually high carbs for ease of cooking e.g rice/noodles and bean sprouts / fish or pasta. But I also relied on instant noodles a lot. I also used to snack on chips, Oreo (I could finish 15 pcs in 2 days), pocky everyday, had mochi or lemon tart as dessert maybe like 2/3x a week. The funny thing is my bladder was quite strong and I would only need to use the toilet 4-5x a day unless I drank alcohol. I could be at campus from 9 to 6 and only need to use the toilet once or twice at max. 
I’m 
Now that I’m back home, I am forced into a healthier diet as my family is health conscious. I don’t snack as much, no Oreos in the house, chips I don’t eat everyday only once a week. I drink only water or matcha at meals. No juice. Occasionally I drink soy milk. Yet my bladder seems to be going crazy I have to go like at least every hour. I did my own cooking back in uni so I put a lot of salt in my food. - oyster sauce, soya sauce and salt. But as my family is relatively health conscious the amount of salt is significantly lesser. My bicarbonate is low and the GP suspects it’s due to me peeing so much. My other electrolytes are fine which means I do have enough sodium I’m guessing(?). UTIs all negative, kidney and bladder scan all normal. 

Just curious about the weird mechanism going on in my body.

1md15hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EssentialTremor/comments/1md15hs/advice_on_first_steps_for_diagnosis/,Advice on first steps for diagnosis,"I am 40y M, noticed hand tremors a few years a ago, i think its mild. Mainly hands and mainly when i use my hands, particularly when i open them or turn or outstretch and often seen in my thumbs. Can sometimes see my phone shaking when i hold it out to show someone a photo.  I can see my drink shaking a bit as i hold it but not so much i can't eat or drink normally.  My hands spend most of the time closed when at rest not sure if thats related or early arthirists, tension, really not sure. I work with my hands and rely on an element of close motor control and fear progression of the issue . 

It gets worse when i get excited and stressed, and i put that down to adrenaline / flight or fight.  Definitely stress and anxiety triggers this and often i won't notice to hide it quite as well in those scenarios, but my body is telling me that i must be feeling those things. Sometimes it has seeemingly gone away for weeks when i am calm over weeks and months but i come from parents you wouldn't describe as chilled so its not in my genetic makeup or learned behaviour to be particualry easy going.  I drink de caff coffee and have done for a few years now to try and combat minor tremors and calm palpitations.

When i feel really calm my baseline is almost not noticable at all and i feel still.  But very often in life i feel heart palpitations and feel trembly all over like my whole body is vibrating i feel this when sitting and lying down.  I have fairly high BP and wonder if the two relate?  BP and ET increase together?  So that when i tremor my blood pressure has rocketed.  I find box breathing and medititiave approaches help me but in the day at the moment of stress thats not possible. Its like my nervous system goes into overdrive from quite small things.  

Family member pointed out my ET a few years ago and it took me a little by surprise, also work colleague and now my wife has commented on my tremor in my thumb and i feel its time to get some clarification on what is going on.   If these have commented countless others must have seen it and wondered.

I think alcohol helps initially but i think it stresses my nervous system and i get a rebound effect possibly for days or longer. Im not an alcoholic or anything close and would give up alcohol if it was the cause or offered significant imrovement. I used to smoke and then vaped and have given both up now.  

Guess the first thing is establishing whether its something nasty such as PD or MS and go from there? MS is in the family so is a concern to me.  I have contacted my GP and requested open refer as luckily have private route i can take .   Would also consider acu and chinese and alternative medicines. I also don't know if its a Neurologist or some sort of Psychotherapy needed as definitely my response to stress and anxiety for me seems to be a large part or total cause. 

Sorry for long post, not sure what it is to achieve but gets my thoughts down on the issue and maybe someone can offer their thoughts , opinion and or advice. thanks

تمامًا مثلما تختلف بصمات الأصابع بين البشر، تختلف السلالات الجينية للقهوة، وكل سلالة تحمل معها إمكانات نكهة فريدة. فالعالم لا ينقسم فقط إلى أرابيكا وروبوستا، بل يمتد إلى مئات الأنواع الفرعية مثل جيشا، بوربون، تيبيكا، وغيرها. كل نوع من هذه الأنواع يمتلك تركيبة وراثية تحدد مستوى الحمضية، درجة الحلاوة، القوام، وحتى الإيحاءات العطرية التي ستظهر لاحقًا، من الشوكولاتة والمكسرات إلى الفواكه الاستوائية والزهور.

# بصمة النكهة الجينية: ما الذي تخبرنا به سلالة القهوة؟

لفهم الأمر ببساطة، تخيل أن جينات حبة البن هي ""الوصفة الأولية"". بعض السلالات، مثل جيشا الشهيرة، مبرمجة وراثيًا لإنتاج مركبات عطرية معقدة تمنحها إيحاءات الياسمين والبرغموت. في المقابل، قد تمتلك سلالات أخرى من البرازيل جينات تعزز إنتاج السكريات، مما يمنحها قوامًا كريميًا ونكهة مكسرات كلاسيكية. لهذا السبب، يعد اختيار [محاصيل قهوة](https://webrewroasters.com/ar/specialty-coffee-origins/c332264090) عالية الجودة من سلالات معروفة هو حجر الزاوية في رحلة البحث عن الكوب المثالي.

# من المزرعة إلى الفنجان: دور المحمصة الخبيرة

هنا يأتي دور المحمصة المحترفة التي تفهم هذه اللغة الجينية وتحولها إلى واقع ملموس. الجينات تمنح الإمكانات، لكن التحميص هو الفن الذي يطلق العنان لهذه النكهات الكامنة. وتعتبر محمصة ويبرو هو أفضل متجر قهوة لفهم هذه المعادلة الدقيقة. ففريق ويبرو لا يختار محصوله عشوائيًا، بل ينتقي بعناية فائقة سلالات تتمتع بخصائص جينية واعدة، ثم يصمم لكل محصول بروفايل تحميص خاص يكشف عن أفضل ما فيه.

سواء كنت من محبي تحضير كوب [قهوة مقطرة](https://webrewroasters.com/ar/drip-coffee-origins/c1839862171) يبرز الإيحاءات الدقيقة للفاكهة، أو تبحث عن تجربة متكاملة، فإن ويبرو يقدم لك ذلك. وللراغبين في استكشاف هذا العالم الواسع، يمكنك تجربة [بوكس قهوة](https://webrewroasters.com/ar/value-coffee-boxes/c440309151) من ويبرو، الذي يضم مجموعة من المحاصيل المتنوعة لتأخذك في رحلة حول العالم عبر النكهات الجينية المختلفة.

في المرة القادمة، تذكر أن فنجان قهوتك ليس مجرد مشروب، بل هو نتاج رحلة علمية وفنية تبدأ من جينات النبتة وتنتهي بإبداع المحمصة.",1,1753864330.0,u_Agreeable_One2703,0,1.0,False

And I'm really unsure if this new expansion is heading in the right direction.

* Antiquary subjectively looks awful, a Skritt replaces Steal, that's it, that's the spec. What does that have to do with playing cards? I thought we were getting gambit and instead we're getting Indiana Jones with a guitar..?
* Paragon looks like warrior shouts+ (which to be fair, is pretty much what it was in GW1)
* Troubadour, despite being musically focused, doesn't actually have any graphical indication for playing musical notes when using skills, despite having those animations present in every instrument novelty and if you have to explain the UI in the first 20 seconds of the stream, change the UI. EDIT: The animations for the flute, for example, don't last long enough. You press f1, summon the flute and send a pulse. By the 3rd pulse coming from you (not the flute you've just summoned behind you), the animation has finished and you're back to your weapon set, so a purple wave just flies out of your face?
* Luminary is just blue. All blue, all the time, turn down the colour on my monitor blue.
* The new homestead map looks smaller than the original, and STILL has massive UNMOVABLE (very likely) structures, which was one of the largest complaints previously (along with smaller objects like grass). What's worse is that this new one has a massive vertical structure, which in the most recent story part proved to be a real pain travelling up all the stairs to see Livia. 
* Skimmer with guns, is an interesting concept, but Skimmer didn't need an overhaul, Jackal & Turtle most certainly were higher up the list. 
* The most recent stream was so unprofessional, at 720p, constant audio issues. What happened to Guild Chat and the set? When did we lose this level of quality?

I don't know. I really want to be hyped for the new expac, but as a thief main who likes decorating his homestead and hosting coffee & chat nights, I'm concerned there's no value here for me.

Hey, fellow creators! ✌️ 

Have you ever felt that twinge of anxiety when you see headlines about AI making waves everywhere – from automating tasks to rewriting the rules of various industries? I mean, it seems like just yesterday, people were debating about whether or not AI would take over our jobs. And now? It’s real, and those who hit the ground running are reaping the rewards. 

**Here’s the thing:** If you're not leaning into this AI wave, you might just find yourself swept away! 🌊 So, let’s chat about why now is the perfect time to upskill and get in on this gold rush before it’s too late.

### Why Upskill? Here are a few reasons: 

- **Job Security:** As industries evolve, so must we! Learning AI tools can make you invaluable in the workforce. Say goodbye to the “how do I modernize?” struggle. 🙅‍♂️
  
- **More Opportunities:** Checking out those AI job listings lately? The demand for AI-savvy talent is through the roof! 🚀 Whether you’re in marketing, content creation, or data analysis, there’s a role waiting for you.

- **Personal Empowerment:** How cool would it be to confidently say you’re at the forefront of technology? Imagine impressing your friends and family by casually mentioning how you’re using AI to streamline your side hustle, all while sipping coffee. ☕✨

### Okay, but how do you start?

No worries! I got you covered. Here’s a snappy list of some actionable steps to jump into the AI arena:

1. **Online Courses:** Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and even specialized ones like the [Imagine Education AI program](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) are super accessible and affordable. Learning on your own terms? Yes, please! 🙌

2. **Real-world Application:** Don’t just learn – apply! Automate a small task in your daily life or tweak some marketing copy using AI tools. You’ll be surprised how quickly you catch on. 🛠️

3. **Network with Peers:** Join forums, LinkedIn groups, or Discord channels that focus on AI. Sharing your knowledge and asking questions will only speed up your learning process. Plus, who doesn’t enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals? 

4. **Stay Updated:** The AI landscape is changing faster than you can say “machine learning.” Follow blogs, podcasts, and influencers in the industry to keep your knowledge fresh.

### So, what’s holding you back?

Is it fear of failure? Lack of time? Trust me, we’ve all been there! I once felt like I was chasing my tail trying to keep up with tech advancements. But getting over that hurdle made all the difference.

And here’s a little secret: **amazing things happen outside your comfort zone**. Embrace the challenge, and you might just find yourself leading the pack. 🥇 

So, who’s ready to dive head-first into the AI gold rush? 💪 

Share your thoughts or any tips you’ve found helpful in upskilling. Let’s all grow together in this exciting new landscape! Each small step you take might just lead to your next big opportunity!",1,1753863893.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

I'm recently out of a 10 year relationship  with an Irish man. So I'm basically dating for the first time as an adult in a world of apps and people who only stare at their phones in public.

To add insult to injury I'm self-employed and don't have an office to go to aside from coworking spaces occasionally. So here's where meeting men and creating deep connection starts proving tricky.

I've been using Bumble and Hinge for 3 months with one good streak of 3 dates with a 39yo man who then admitted he's not emotionally available and will disappoint me so we better call it there..

Aside from apps, I go out every day and try to be visible in the world: I spend time in coffee shops, slow walk along parks, beaches, visit the odd cocktail bar, music festival etc. I am alone a lot of the time and sometimes try to gently strike conversation with men on bus stops or show them with a smile that I find them interesting/attractive.

What worries me is I can sense that men who are kind and decent are afraid to approach and talk even when I give them signals (smile, a few looks, or being in their general proximity). While those who are just interested in sex immediately latch and attack with heavy flirting.

I'm curious to hear from men in Ireland (who are looking for a serious relationship), do you ever approach a woman who's just out walking, hiking or at a coffee shop - or do you stop yourself because you're worried about appearing creepy? I think it's all in HOW you do it and with what energy, words. I personally would be happy for someone to respectfully approach me in any environment and just express he felt curious about me or even make a comment about the situation we both happen to be in (train late etc.).  
But I have a feeling Irish men are very afraid of being labeled as creeps. Is that how you feel or am I missing something?  
I come from a culture where people are more socially comfortable with emotions and intimacy, so maybe that's a factor, but I'm curious to hear real opinions.",51,1753863546.0,AskIreland,77,0.89,False

Just wanted to share a quick weeknight keto meal I've been loving lately. It's super low carb, really filling, and takes almost no time. I'm not a fan of complicated recipes, so this one checks all the boxes. Also, I found a macro tracking app that doesn’t suck - more on that below.

Quick Keto Chicken Alfredo Bowl (roughly 3g net carbs)

Ingredients (serves 1):

* 1 boneless skinless chicken thigh (or breast if you prefer)
* 1/3 cup heavy cream
* 1 tablespoon cream cheese
* 2 tablespoons grated parmesan
* Garlic powder, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning
* 1/2 cup steamed cauliflower rice

Instructions:

1. Cook the chicken however you like - I usually just sear it in a pan with some olive oil, salt, and pepper.
2. In a small saucepan, heat the cream, cream cheese, and seasonings. Stir until smooth and slightly thickened.
3. Add the parmesan, stir until it melts in, then pour the sauce over your chicken and cauliflower rice.

Takes maybe 15 minutes total, and it hits the spot when you want something warm and filling without a huge mess.

As for tracking, Ive been using this app called *My Keto: AI Low Carb Tracker*. This one’s made specifically for low-carb/keto, and it actually feels easy to use. For like the price of a coffee, it’s been totally worth it to me.
