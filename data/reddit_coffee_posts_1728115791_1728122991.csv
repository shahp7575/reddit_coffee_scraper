The property had been empty before us for about 12 months, and on one of our visits to measure up before the lease was signed, when we walked through the kitchen/storage area there were puddles of water, and it was obvious there had been a major leak in there coming from the ceiling.

The landlord followed up and concluded a blocked gutter had caused the kitchen to floor when it rained, it took around 4 - 6 weeks to get it rectified.  Before signing the lease we emphasised to the landlord how important it was the leak was fixed and we were assured by the landlord the issue was fixed.

During our renovation the electrician opened the electrical box inside the unit to do something and found a plastic bag filled with water, directly above that box was a hole in the ceiling and water marks down the wall, clearly there had been a previous leak there.  We informed the landlord of this and they replied essentially they didn't put the bag of water in there ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

We opened the coffee shop in June, fast forward to September and the first instance of heavy rain in months flooded the kitchen again.  Including water down the wall, directly into the electrical box, causing power to be shut off to the unit for safety until the leak is fixed.

Investigations have concluded the leak is caused by a blocked gutter above the unit, caused by a pigeon infestation in the space in between our unit and the one above.

We know the pigeons were here before we got the lease because we emailed the landlord in the first week or two to say we could hear pigeons.

We've now been closed for 2 weeks, we don't have a timeline of when the issue will be fixed (the landlord's insurance won't cover issues caused by vermin) and being a brand new business this essentially puts us back to square one of we do reopen.  We were steadily building a customer base before this.

My question is essentially do we have any legal standing to exit the lease, or even recoup any of the money we've spent (around ¬£30k) on refurb etc based on the issue being a pre-existing one we were assured was resolved?

Not to mention the danger caused to staff walking into a wet kitchen where the water is running through a live electrical box.

Any help or pointers would be really appreciated.

(Throwaway account in case we end up pursuing a legal route)

I‚Äôm 17 currently. I have 2 brothers, one older (20) and one younger (6). My parents are divorced and both have their own new families. My dad moved away and cut contact with us, and my mom moved out of the country 5 years ago for a work opportunity. I love my family but sometimes I wish we were like the other normal and complete ones. Like I wish I had a dad growing up, to bring me to school, tell me what to do and not to do. I wish my mom was here with us so I had someone to talk to about my problems, or just to learn cooking from. But I guess not, I understand why they had to leave and I don‚Äôt blame them.

For some reason both of their responsibilities were transferred to me when they left, I was 13 taking care of my little brother and cleaning the house and going outside to buy the groceries, all while trying to keep my grades up, and my social life. Up to this day that‚Äôs all I do, and I‚Äôve grown accustomed to it but there are some times where I let everything go and I‚Äôm just holed up in my room, letting the house get dirty, the laundry and dishes to pile, things to break. Like now, it‚Äôs been 2 weeks. I get so angry with everyone and especially my older brother. Why am I the only one doing all these? Why can‚Äôt he do them too? Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic but there is no way that‚Äôs fair. Things in school are getting harder to keep up with! I have to come home and clean and prepare food and then I have to do all my activities for school, maybe I‚Äôll have to go outside again to buy things that we need, I have to take care of myself and my little brother‚Äî I‚Äôm so tired!! I‚Äôm really really tired. I just want to sleep for a whole week. I‚Äôm tired with all these responsibilities I have to keep up with! I want to hear my dad watching the TV again, making his coffee for the morning. I want to hear my mom starting up the vacuum at 7 a.m, I want to see a simple breakfast on the dining room table that wasn‚Äôt made by me. I want to smell newly washed clothes that weren‚Äôt hung on the clothesline outside by me. I don‚Äôt want it all to be me anymore. I‚Äôm so sick of it. I want to become a rock and just not have to do anything but lay and be still. I‚Äôm thinking once this is all over, I‚Äôm gonna have a glass of water and maybe sleep for a while. I want to rest.

1fwmxa1,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCivilService/comments/1fwmxa1/asking_someone_out/,Asking someone out,"Hi

I have only recently started in the Civil Service and two of the reasons I did was to build up friendships and possibly discover a romantic partner. Well literally when I walked in the building I saw a very attractive woman working behind reception. She appears to be a very funny and kind hearted individual. She seems to be age appropriate, so I am not creeping on someone younger than me. As she is Polish I taught myself a few phrases like ""hello"" ""Goodbye"" ""Have a nice evening"" etc so I could be friendly. So when I used these, with colleagues around, she said to me, that she was a Polish/English teacher and would offer me some help if I want to learn. Now I am pickled, was this just her drumming up teaching work, or was this her flirting with me.   

The reason I am asking this question in the Civil Service reddit, is that I don't want to risk getting into trouble if I ask her out. I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable in case I am read things wrong. So if I asked her out for coffee, how can I do it without breaking civil service rules. I know I am being overly sensitive but unfortunately previous relationships have had a negative effect on my life and career. ",0,1728122082.0,TheCivilService,5,0.33,False

Alarms, coffee, set sleep times, melatonin; nothing gets me to stay in ANY set sun based schedule. When I have to follow set times, it means I have to feel tired unless I happen to be awake at the right time. I've tried removing coffee (currently off), melatonin (currently off), alarms (currently off) (not forcing my brain seems to help); but society doesn't let me ditch set sleep/wake times. No matter what, my natural schedule, if I let my brain have this setup, to be at my mental peak; its be awake anywhere from 14-22 hours & sleep for anywhere from 8-14 hours, when the suns up or not, doesn't change the schedule. Worse than that, I tend to have a slump at 5-8am right as the sun comes up no matter when I woke up or went to sleep, so right when society wants me to be awake, I want to sleep or at least be relaxed (this happens regardless if I have something I have to do that day, proving that its NOT from my brain rejecting the tasks). This when I was younger made me think that I'm a night owl but no, I cant stay in a night schedule either. For those thinking oh well just go to sleep at 5-8am if you can; if I do & haven't been awake for at least 14 hours, I wont sleep, & some days I WILL end up being awake for at least 17 hours whether if I lie in bed or not so I cant rely on 5-8am.

The thing about this is that my peak productivity times are not predictable based on the time; they can be literally any hour & different abilities such as logic vs creativity peak at different times, productivity peaks for me are based on how I woke up feeling, & have I been doing a lot in the previous hours. If I was productive in the 1st third of my day, 2nd or 3rd wont be. If I woke up tired, creativity is probably excellent but logic is terrible & procrastination is through the roof. **The question I have is:**

**How do I gain more control over this & maximize my potential? My work is mostly thinking/being creative thankfully, so maximizing brain function & reducing but not eliminating tiredness is essential. I use Lucid dreaming alot so not being tired at all: hurts, not helps.**

The search for an answer has been a nightmare filled with endless gaslighting of articles & whatnot trying to say:

'For me & according to this site; set a schedule, stick to it & feel the benefits' (I end up being half as capable & slightly depressed).

'Use naps, they do wonders' (2nd part of day I'm endlessly sluggish).

'Be in the sun more' (Does literally nothing, am in a well lit room & scheduling when I'm outside in broad daylight couldn't have less of an effect).

'I drink coffee & sleep with melatonin' (melatonin can work for a week but beyond that I end up being tired after using melatonin, the next 10-30ish hours I'm tired regardless of caffeine & sleep. Also coffee doesn't make me feel awake, just seems to make a void where I dont feel anything, I shake like crazy & I'm no more mentally capable)",1,1728121379.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

I am a 20 years old international student and I was looking for a shareflat, and I have got in trouble with the landlord.

Two weeks ago I've found a good one. I went for an inspection and liked it, and I payed the deposit to live from the end of this month. The landlord is a male and he is maybe around his late thirties.
Though, the room didn't have a desk and a chair I needed, and the landlord told me he will purchase them for me so that let's keep in touch about it.
 A week ago, he told me if I want to grab a cup of coffee with him. I agreed and also for looking for the desk and the chair I need. After coffee, we went to the shareflat once again and he invited me to his room. 

I had no idea what was going on in his mind since I thought he was being nice and have chat with me, now I know I have should been more careful. We were watching TV for a while and then he suddenly started to compliment me, and said to me if he can give me a kiss. I didn't like it so I told him no, but he also touched my thighs. I was really overwhelmed but I kept telling him I'm not here for any these kind of things. He didn't try to get violent nor tried to push me down. He stopped and told me ""We don't have to be in any relationship. Also I thought all this hang out was for us to have fun in the end. But I won't do that unless you change your mind in the future."" He didn't do any further and drove me to the city after that. 
The bad side of me was I was still being polite and nice to him. He kept texting me about restaurants he wants to go with me and these kinds of small talk on texts but nothing inappropriate.

But two days ago, I've decided to change the shareflat because I think it is possible he could take an advantage of me. I told him about it, and that I want my deposit back last morning. 
Here is the overall conversation since I cannot attach the image here, I copied his messages from the app;

*Me: I was thinking about what happened two days ago and I've been feeling uncomfortable about it.
-Landlord: I'll back off completely.. I'm moving on with another girl already..so it's fine
*Me: No, it's not fine to me because I'm yet not feeling comfortable living around you. I would like my money back
-Landlord: Okie well here's the deal.. U accepted to come back to my place..with full knowledge that I liked u.. So..if u just want to back out of the deal, especially after waiting for so long, to move in? No..I'm not giving u back ur money

-Landlord: No I didn't
*Me: You have. I did not like what you did to me. I would like to my deposit back.

After I sent the last message, he hasn't replied me yet. At this point, I have no idea about what he said. I didn't know he had feelings for me. What should I do from this? Also I don't think police will take it seriously and make it into an incident because I don't have any evidence. Now I think I should have recorded it but I was too overwhelmed to think about it at that moment. Also I couldn't say anything whilst he was driving me back to the city, he touched my thighs once or twice.

I am going to contact my school on Monday and agency if they can help me because they're closed on weekends. But at the same time, I don't want to because I don't want to put burden on anyone.

1fwmnqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1fwmnqd/i_dont_have_hobbies_only_interests/,"I don't have hobbies, only interests ","I'd love to get out of the house, have more friends, be fitter, but it feels impossible. I know it isn't, but it just feels like everything is stopping me from going out. A big factor is that I'm absolutely broke, haven't got a partner, and only a couple friends. These don't really bother me, but fixing them would admittedly make the issue less of a problem. 

When I think of hobbies that I could pursue, I'm at a loss. If I need some sort of subscription or payment to get in, it's out for me. If it's something that I could just do at my house, like learning a language, I see no point in driving to some place like the library. I go on walks frequently and they're enjoyable, but it's all the same unless I want to Forest Gump it. And walking isn't a hobby. 

The day to day of just rotting in my house is starting to get a little maddening. I have things that I would like to do, so many in fact, but for some reason I can't get myself to do them. A non complete list is getting better at musical instruments, writing a book, doing yoga, and expanding my wardrobe. I recognize that my inability to pursue these are entirely self inflicted, especially with things like ADHD playing into the equation. Even so, none of these hobbies would get me any new friends. 

I have a couple of friends. To be honest they're all friends from school or friends of those friends, it was a lot easier to meet people that way. We'll get together and play board games. We've only got so many and board games are a little pricey. I've bought two new board games two weeks ago and we're already starting to get a little bit sick of them. They're also totally fine with staying indoors all day, but fitness is very important to me. I lack discipline and opportunity to get to where I want to be, and I wish I had friends who valued doing something active instead. No shame to these guys, but I want to better myself and I feel worse when I'm not doing that. I've tried to do the at home workout thing, but I think I need some sort of gym bro pal to help me figure it all out. 

Today I saw one of my best friends. I haven't seen him in so long. I've just moved and I'm way closer to him, but he's either incredibly busy with his job or doesn't take any time to see me. I wish he would, but I understand he's somewhat mentally ill just like me and I don't hold it against him. I could only see him for a few minutes before I had to go, but he said that he wanted to put a musical group together, like we were in one back in the day. I said to him ""you better not just be talking, because I'd love to do that"". He said it would be awesome to do, but I really feel like it's not going to happen. 

It's mainly a lot of feelings. There's actions I could take right now to make it better, but without help from other people I feel like I'm swimming in circles. I can't say I have no friends, but I really feel like I don't want to be living how I'm living. Right now I recall a whole month out of the year where I did at home workouts, months where I was sticking to a kind of decent diet, even dusting off the old instruments, but eventually the momentum just runs out. 

I have no clue how I'd actually organically meet a woman, let alone what I would even have going for me. I'm lonely but I can't imagine trying to date right now. I hate my body, I have no money, and like the title says I don't do anything besides work or watch content based on my interests. I've had dating apps but if I got a match, we'd just have to go out someplace where I'd spend money. 

That's another big frustration of mine, having to spend money to facilitate social interaction. Coffee dates are apparently a big no no now, so I guess I gotta put money down if I'm going to want good company. I'm just so tired of it all. I swear this used to be easier.

1fwmekl,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1fwmekl/i_try_to_do_everything_right_and_to_show_my/,"I try to do everything right and to show my respect, but i fail 100 times. Seems like Google tells me Bullsh*t all the time... Can someone teach me how to behave with vietnamese? ","Good Morning guys and gals. 

I have a problem with informations which come from Google. 

To explain better: 

There is a vietnamese guy, who works in my favorite restauran.  He came to germany to work here. I think, it might be two years now, that we smile at each other. Two weeks ago this finally ended and came up to a contact, because his coworkers helped. (He speaks no german nor english, so all what we can do is smiling. After work he tells his friends then, how desperate he is because he cant talk with me, so they gave me his contact. I use x translators, write in vietnamese and meantime i finally know some tricks to understand. The rest of it is nonverbale sounds, bodylanguage etc).

The first ""meeting"", where i just wanted to drive him home, was a bit scary, because he is a big fan of sniffkisses (tho he sniffs me like a line ...) and im not used to it. On top he touched me everywhere, seeking for muscles (i am overweighted). That was rude and scared me, but he already apologized a thousand times. 

Although i told him, that my former history with male people were full of violence and pain, he didnt realize what exactly i try to say, so i told him all the bad stories and he finally understood. He said, he didnt know, that it is so extreme and thought, i am just shy. Well... 

I met him again to talk about that, he understood the problem and everything what happened after was my wish and permission. Now it is the most tender Man on earth and we came closer.  Meanwhile we share the bed and the s\*xual experiences i made with him so far is mindblowing. The first time of my life i have no pain while sleeping with someone. Nobody ever touched me like he does, nobody ever cared about me this way. Really, im in love! 

The only problem is, that i always make mistakes because Google told me so. In the end i learn then: What google says is not true, in combination of this man. 

For example: Google said: NEVER touch a vietnamese at its head or shoulder. Its forbidden because they believe, the soul lives in their heads. Only monks are allowed to touch heads. 

Google also said: NEVER be on point when you have a date. Its unpolite to be. When they say: ""Come at 3pm"", it doesnt mean: ""Come at 3pm"", it means: ""come round about a hour later"". Which led to, that i never was on point when i wanted to met him. Mostly i was 15 min too late. When it was the time, which was said and i wasnt there, he used the chat, asking where i am. So i said:  ""Im standing around the corner not to be on point...."" He said, its not true that this is a polite gesture. 

Google also said: Dont look in vietnamese eyes. Its provoking and unpolite aswell. If you look them into their eyes, you can be seen as someone, who make s\*xual offers. (Which led into, that i thought, that kinky abuse from him at the beginning was my fault). 

Also i struggle with invitations from his coworkers. 

2 days ago we had a date for 3pm to go for a walk, drink a coffee together, enjoy the day... But his coworker said: ""Come at 2pm for a meal, after we will go for a walk here"". So Google said: ""Its not polite to refuse invitations. Vietnamese dont like that, its respectless to refuse anything. Smile and say yes, because they dont even mean it like this. Only if they invite you more than once, you can believe, they really want you to come"". 

Guess what - i sat here and felt so bad, because i didnt know what to do. I wrote my guy and told him the problem. That she wants to see me at 2pm, while i already told him, i come at 3pm and pick him up... 

Again he told me, its BS and i just shall say what i think. It has nothing to do with respectlessness. 

My question to you is now: 

How can i know when something is right or wrong? So far Google told me so much BS, which wasnt true in the end. But i cant say its complete nonsense, because some things feel true. For example that he never shows his love in public. When we were out for that walk, i wanted to touch his hand, but he pulled it away. When we saw a really romantic lake with a lot of swans, i wanted to hug him, but again he slipped away and avoided contact. 

I already red about that. Thats something true, Google said: ""In vietnam for elder people its disturbing. They dont likes it, when someone shows love like this"". This is how he behaves. As if any time the police would drop off a tree and arrest him for that. 

I already asked if he is embarassed about me, because i have no prob with that (as a german maybe), but he says, he is not embarassed at all. 

  
How i know when Google is telling me Sh\*t and when its true? I already made so many mistakes while i tried to avoid all that mistakes. Seen this way its really hillarious because i already made everything, which i tried not to do and I specifically read how to do it.

I really want to show him my respect and fail in a row...

1fwmdjb,https://i.redd.it/zmg8965rmwsd1.jpeg,Musebeauty perfumes review,"Hello! Fellow Perfume Lovers,

There's a barrage of fragrances available in the market today, from the oft ""unattainable"" niche and designer houses to more affordable clone makers, all of whom release numerous options for fragheads like us to own and enjoy. This can be a rather expensive hobby to maintain, but thanks to creators such as MuseBeauty, our passion for perfumes needn't break the bank!

I came across this seller Musebeauty a week or so ago, and I was curious to try their perfumes. Here's my quick take on this fragrance house and the perfumes I bought on Swiggy Minis:

About MuseBeauty: First off, can we please take a moment to appreciate this fierce young entrepreneur who has launched this small business Indie brand?! Many congratulations to the seller, for the attempt at offering some amazing Gourmand perfumes that are inspired by popular fragrances at highly competitive and affordable prices, coupled with gorgeous aesthetics and brilliant descriptions, without compromising on the quality and essence of the actual juice.

About Purchase Process: The purchase interaction was a delight and a breeze. They currently offer 4 variants of perfumes, and one of them was out of stock at the time of purchase. I got in touch with the seller over Swiggy chat, and she was prompt and polite with her responses to my queries. I had initially ordered one each of two fragrances, but I decided to cancel that order and place a new one with extra units for gifting purposes. She was kind enough to help with the cancellation immediately. Moreover, I was informed that the out of stock variant (Caramel Pistachio) would be available in the following week at larger bottle sizes (30 ml and 50 ml), so I decided to preorder one for myself. Will review that once I get my grubby hands on it (hopefully next week!) :)

Long story short, totally appreciate and recommend MuseBeauty as a seller.

About the perfumes:

All of them are inspired by a popular perfume. Personally, I think it would do better justice to review each on a standalone basis than as a comparison, simply because it is practically impossible to absolutely mirror a high-end fragrance. Leaves lesser room for disappointment, too :)

1) Espresso Vanilla: Inspired by YSL Black Opium. The opening gives you citrusy notes nuanced with a mild coffee scent. This quickly moves to the middle phase that is Jasmine dominant yet that hint of coffee lingers throughout. Within 30 minutes, the perfume settles into a warm and comforting scent of woody notes, vanilla and coffee (I detect a wee bit of bitter almond too, but it's ever so slight). All in all, a gorgeous fragrance, perfect for balmy evenings, dinner parties, date night rendezvous and such. The longevity, projection and sillage may not be as promised (8+ hours guaranteed, says the description). That being said, at this price point, I don't mind refreshing the scent once every 3 hours or so. A true gem!

2) Coco Vanilla Bourbon: Inspired by Mugler Alien Goddess. Now this one is my personal favourite of the two. White florals, vanilla goodness with coconut water-esque notes that make for the perfect scent to carry during beach vacations, brunches with your galpals, movie dates etc. I can't stop sniffing my arm! This variant lasts longer than Espresso Vanilla. Definitely back-up worthy!

Summary: I am truly surprised and delighted at the superior quality of the perfume, right from presentation to performance, that defies the expectation typically garnered at this price point. Needless to say, these are going to be staples in my collection for good. 

Kudos to MuseBeauty, and keep delighting us with these gorgeous renditions!

1fwmcx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alaska/comments/1fwmcx3/unsolicited_review_of_alaska_based_on_my_vacation/,Unsolicited review of Alaska based on my vacation,"From your worst enemy: a Californian

Safety:
I felt safe and didn‚Äôt feel the need to worry about harassment or theft. I realized that your drive thrus don‚Äôt require payment prior to receiving the items, presumably because you trust people won‚Äôt drive off prior to paying. Anchorage was probably the least safe; I got caught in that police stand off on Muldoon and the homeless in downtown catcalled me. 

People:
I was impressed by the diversity. Ive spent two weeks traveling other states without coming across any POC. also saw openly LGBTQ folks which was reassuring after encountering a weirdly super religious and homophobic cafe.  The people are a bit antisocial, but no one was rude or mean at all. Just dont expect the fake customer service smiles here. I get the feeling Alaska generally is a bit exasperated by its tourists. I was also expecting something similar to Arizona, where learning about the indigenous tribes and buying their art directly from them was super abundant and accessible, so I was surprised that there was less opportunities in Alaska to learn about and buy from indigenous people. (Very bummed I was unable to visit the Alaska Native Heritage Center in Anchorage.)

Aesthetics:
The small town calmness and the charm (especially the character in the housing) was very refreshing. The natural scenery is equally beautiful everywhere. It‚Äôs like a national park everywhere you go. I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many birch trees. I also appreciated the pride Alaska took in its iconic natural motifs (fireweed, birch trees, etc). Saw two moose.  Loved the cold weather. But coming from California, the lack of biodiversity (in comparison) caused the wonder to wane. It became repetitive, even though that‚Äôs not a problem I encountered in other states like Oregon.  I was also a bit underwhelmed by Denali. And obviously bummed I didn‚Äôt catch the northern lights despite trying. 

Food:
It was honestly hit or miss, which was a first out of the states ive travelled. Not a fan of caribou or reindeer meat. Every restaurant has seafood pasta. I never thought id utter ‚Äútoo much pasta‚Äù in my life but here we are. Ive eaten a lifetimes worth of salmon. I‚Äôm worried about your mercury levels. For some reason it‚Äôs impossible to find burgers for dinner/past three pm, please fix that. Your water has so much iron/minerals in it, it tastes like blood and it concerns me that no one else was concerned about it. Your coffee places only serve drip or they have every syrup flavor ever invented. It‚Äôs adorable you call drip coffee ‚Äúsludge‚Äù and freeze ‚Äúice rage‚Äù. Lotus is amazing. Thoroughly enjoyed the plethora of berry themed drinks and foods. Fairbanks had the best food and coffee. Anchorage was honestly annoyingly limited, the best being Moose‚Äôs Tooth by miles. Seward was the worst.  Primrose was fine but needs to tone down the pretentiousness.  I‚Äôd only recommend Zudys Cafe. Everything else was inedible.

Anchorage:
The Anchorage Museum and Discovery Center was fine; I enjoyed learning about the Native Alaskan tribes. The Anchorage zoo was depressing because you didn‚Äôt have to have an education or background in wildlife to know that all the animals pacing back and forth repeatedly were deeply unhappy. 

Fairbanks: 
Was unimpressed with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks Museum of the North. The Fairbanks ice museum was so bad it was funny. Went to Chena River resort, but I‚Äôm not a hot springs person. It was a lot of hassle and discomfort for what can be accomplished with a hot tub. Their ice museum was much more enjoyable but not for the claustrophobic. Mainly liked Fairbanks for the food and shopping. 

Denali:
I‚Äôd advise against going to Denali in the off season. It was disturbing how food and lodging were almost entirely non existent because it was the off season. And unless you plan on camping or climbing Denali honestly you can skip the park altogether. 

Seward:
Perhaps the friendliest town. But again wasn‚Äôt impressed with Kenai Fjords tour. Absolutely adored the aquarium. The scenic by way was very beautiful. 

Whittier:
The tour of the tidewater glaciers was surprisingly very lovely. But I‚Äôm afraid nothing can make up for how fucking creepy Whittier is. A tunnel that closes at 11pm, trapping you there? A population of ~300 all living in one condo building?? The railroad owns the entire former secret military port??? That sounds like the plot of that show Under the Dome. Someone needs to rescue them

Overall 
I think if you‚Äôre not athletic like me, then you‚Äôll probably feel like Alaska isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúfor‚Äù you, whereas if you love winter sports or fishing/hunting/flying tiny helicopters then Alaska was designed for you. Something about it just didn‚Äôt feel welcoming to me. While I‚Äôm glad I went, I think in comparison to other trips ive taken I was overall a bit bored and generally underwhelmed. And even though it was the state I hiked the least in, it ran me absolutely ragged for some reason. It was almost draining. 

Also, as a Californian, I‚Äôve never experienced entire towns completely shutting down in the ‚Äúoff season.‚Äù That‚Äôs not a thing in CA. There are tourist seasons, but everything is still there, the people are still there, the shops and restaurants are still open even when it‚Äôs not tourist season. That was unnerving.

**Slavery and Modernity**

‚Ä¶

**Shifting Identity and Racial Slavery**

In practice, slaves were conceived of as an inferior species, and treated as beasts of burden to be driven and inventoried like cattle. Yet like all racist ideologies, this one was riddled with bad faith. **The slaves were useful to the planters precisely because they were men and women capable of understanding and executing complex orders, and of intricate co-operative techniques. The most disturbing thing about the slaves from the slaveholder‚Äôs point of view was not cultural difference but the basic similarity between himself and his property.** Africans could procreate with Europeans, and occupied the same ecological niche. As Benjamin Franklin was to observe, slaves, unlike sheep, could rise in rebellion. The great world religions all registered the anthropological fact of common humanity. And while they might aspire the brotherhood of man and comity of nations, their attitude to infidels often revealed an awareness of humanity‚Äôs greatest enemy. As Jean-Paul Sartre pointed out:

* Nothing - not even wild beasts or microbes - could be more terrifying for man than a species which is intelligent, carnivorous, and cruel, which can understand and outwit human intelligence, and whose aim is precisely the destruction of man. This, however, is obviously our own species as perceived by each of its members in the context of scarcity.

The American planter who treated his slaves like subhumans would typically reveal a fear and surplus aggression towards them which stemmed from a belief that they could take over his plantation and his womenfolk if they were given the slightest real opportunity to do so. Sartre‚Äôs insight links up with Foucault‚Äôs thesis that racism is an expression of permanent social war. In his 1976 lectures at the College de France, **Foucault actually identified the origins of racial consciousness in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries with popular antagonism to the aristocratic element in the premodern state, itself based on racial conceits (Saxons against aristocratic Normans in England, Franks against aristocratic Goths in France, and so forth). In this conception, however, the racial feeling which could challenge the aristocracy could also be deployed against outsiders**.

**Oceanic migration, both voluntary and forced, bringing previously distant human groups into intimate contact with one another, created the need to work out new systems of ascribed identity** <or transvaluation>. **Jack Forbes has shown that even such apparently clear terms as ‚ÄòNegro‚Äô were remarkably labile in the sixteenth century, often referring to those later called ‚ÄòIndians‚Äô or toa variety of ethnic mixtures.** The world opened up by the ‚ÄòDiscoveries‚Äô, as Vitorino Magalhaes Godinho has observed, plunged Europeans into a vertiginous sense of novelty wherever they looked, with new plants, new fruits, new animals, new customs, new peoples and a new sky at night. In North America in the 1530s the would-be *conquistador* Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, together with his African slave Estevanico and two companions, were captured by Indian peoples following the foundering of an expedition of which he was treasurer. His fascinating account of their subsequent fate ‚Äî of the Indians‚Äô insistence that they were possessed of the power of healing, of their travels among a succession of Indians peoples, and of their disillusioning return to the rapacious and brutal world of Christian slave hunters - conveyed to a wider public the strange moral reversals which could take place at the borderlands of empire and beyond.

\[\*18. Here is Cabeza de Vaca‚Äôs description of an incident following their first contact with their fellow countrymen:

* They \[the Indians accompanying them\] were willing to do nothing until they had delivered us into the hands of other Indians, as had been their custom‚Ä¶ Our countrymen became jealous at this, and caused their interpreter to tell the Indians that we were of them, and for a long time we had been lost; that they were the lords of the land who must be obeyed and served, while we were persons of mean condition and small force. The Indians cared little or nothing for what was told them; and conversing amongst themselves said the Christians lied: that we had come whence the sun rises, and they whence it goes down: we healed the sick, they killed the sound; that we had come naked and barefooted, while they had arrived in clothing on horses with lances; that we were not covetous of anything, but that all were given, we directly turned to give, remaining with nothing; that the others had the only purpose to rob whomsoever they found, bestowing nothing on anyone. \]

Michael Pietz gives an example of shifting identities in an anecdote relating to a time and place where they were, perhaps, at their most fluid. It is told by a Portuguese, and relates to an encounter with the slave of a friend of his in the Gambia river in 1624:

* I met a black Mandiga youth, by name Gaspar Vaz. The black was good tailor and button maker. As soon as he knew that I was in port he came to see me and paid a call on me with great enthusiasm. He embraced me, saying he could not believe it was me he saw, and that God had brought me there so that he could do me some service. For this I gave him thanks, saying that I was very pleased to see him too, so that I could give him news of his master and mistress and acquaintances, but that I was distressed to see him dressed in a Mandiga smock, with amulets of his fetiches (Gods) around his neck \[*com nominas dos seus feiticos ao pescoco*\], to which he replied: ‚ÄòSir, I wear this dress because I am nephew of Sandeguil, Lord of this town, whom the tangmaos call Duke, since he is the person who commands after the King. On the death of Sandeguil, my uncle, I will be inheritor of all his goods, and for this reason I dress in the clothes that your honour sees but I do not believe the Law of Mohammed, rather I abhor it. I believe in the Law of Christ Jesus, and so that your honour may know that what I say is true‚Äô - he took off his smock, beneath which he wore a doublet and a shirt in our fashion, and from around his neck he drew out a rosary of Our Lady - ‚Äòevery day I commend myself to God and the Virgin Our Lady by means of this rosary. And if I do not die, but come to inherit the estate of my uncle I will see to it that some slaves are sent to Santiago and when I have found a ship to take me I will go to live in that island and die among Christians.‚Äô It was no small advantage to me to meet him in the Gambia, because he was of service to me in everything, and what I bought was at the price current among the people themselves, very different from the price they charge the tangamaos. And he served me as interpreter and linguist.

While this was evidently a happy accident, the ambivalent identities it revealed were not those to be required by slave-owning planters who needed labourers fixed to one spot and one role. Skin colour came to serve as an excellent and readily identified marker which everyone carried around on their face and limbs, ruling out any hope of imposture or dissimulation. If necessary, some systems of racial classification could give importance to different shades or phenotypes; in other cases skin could be ‚Äòlightened‚Äô by paying fees to the authorities. But the baseline of this system of racial classification was simply pigmentation. New World slavery was peculiarly associated with darker pigmentation or ‚Äòblack‚Äô skin. Not every black was a slave, but most blacks were, and on this assumption every black could be treated like a slave unless they could prove free status - and even then, they would still be treated worse than white colonists. In the colonies of the Catholic and Latin powers the racial hierarchy was a little more complex and baroque, in ways to be mentioned below. But skin colour remained a vital social marker, one highly correlated with enslavement.

Thus, in the racial theory which became peculiarly associated with plantation slavery, the abstracted physiological characteristics of skin colour and phenotype come to be seen as the decisive criteria of race, a term which had hitherto had a more ample sense of family or kind, nature or culture. The reduction at work met practical tests. It furnished an identity document in an epoch when many were illiterate it also corresponded to a fetishistic logic which Pietz‚Äôs essay seeks to unravel. **The European traders and travelers believed that Africans were victims of a strange category mistake and an inability to grasp general concepts; instead they had their ‚Äòfetishes‚Äô, assortments of strange objects which were imbued with supernatural powers. The word fetish was not taken from any African language but simply derived from the the Portuguese** ***feiti√ßo ‚Äî*** **from the verb to make, but in this form usually referring to witchcraft.**

**Just as skin colour and phenotype helped to fix race, so the complex systems of trade and barter helped to produce a schedule of equivalents, reducible to gold or silver, or shells or currency, or - as was often to be the case by the eighteenth century - by notional iron bars used as a** *numeraire.* Such currencies were general equivalents in terms of which anything, most especially slaves, could be valued. But slaves themselves were increasingly, and then exclusively, acquired as a means to the production of other commodities. To begin with, the Portuguese were mainly interested in gold dust, spices and modest consignments of sugar; the Spanish were obsessed with specie, and only tiny quantities of dyestuffs, sugar and chocolate. The Dutch, the French and the English merchants or planters eventually took the lead with larger quantities of sugar, rum, molasses, tobacco, indigo, cotton, and coffee. And in a new Atlantic ‚Äî indeed, global ‚Äî dance of commodities, European and Eastern manufacturers moved in a reverse direction: to the colonies and the African coast.

The elaborate and competitive processes of exchange which led to these diverse goods being presented in the marketplace helped to obscure their conditions of production and minimize the sense of social or moral responsibility of all those involved. Thus the planter or merchant could day to himself: if I refuse to buy the slave, then someone else will. This logic of atomization and serialization, in which each feels obliged to mimic the other in himself, has also been theorized by Sartre. **Given the manifold uncertainties and frequent obscurity of the new market society, and the novel encounters on which it was based, it is not surprising that it bred new anxieties and truncated perceptions. Thus early modern Europeans, encountering Native Americans or Africans, believed them to be living outside culture and morality in some ‚Äòwild‚Äô and ‚Äònatural‚Äô state. This aroused both phobic fears and fantasies, and utopian longings and projections.** The ideologies of enslavement found ways to mobilize the former - though, as will be argued below, **it was by no means clear that it was either prudent or profitable to acquire and rely on wild savages, depraved cannibals, murderous devils, and the like. In fact the identity of the slave had to be domesticated, normalized or naturalized. Their reduction to the status of a chattel was a decisive element in this process.** <Hmm‚Ä¶>

The social relations of unsupervised economic exchange have sometimes been thought to promote a rough-and-ready equality between buyer and seller. In fact this was to be the case both on the African coast and in the Americas, though pointedly excluded from its scope were to be those captives who were themselves to be traded. In an influential essay on the origins of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century abolitionism Thomas Haskell has argued that the new world of long-distance trade promoted a sense of human interconnectedness, and of the efficacy of long-distance action, which spontaneously undermined the legitimacy of slavery. On the other hand Ellen Meiskins Wood argued that the formal equality implied by the new salience of capitalist relations in the early modern period was more likely to have exactly the opposite consequences, fostering new doctrines of race, ethnicity and gender to explain and justify substantive inequality and exclusion. **While the slavery of the Ancient World had not denied the basic humanity of the slave, the emergent capitalist societies of seventeenth-century Europe could only recognize the humanity of those who had something to sell - of the African merchant or monarch, but not the African captive.**

Thomas Holt has argued that American slavery had its roots in a new configuration of the everyday, so that the decision of a consumer to buy a point of sugar refers us to the global social relations which made this possible:

* A woman buying a pound of sugar . . . has doubled aspect: hers is at once a simple gesture but one within which are inscribed complex social relations. Her action not only expresses but makes possible a global structure of imperialist politics and labor relations which racialize consumption as well as production.

It is part of the purpose of this book to explore how these structure were established, and to locate the role of the everyday in their elaboration and reproduction. At a certain level the consumer did indeed have a critical part to play. Early modern Europe witnessed the emergence of a cash demand for popular luxuries, fuelled by the larger numbers of people who now received rents, salaries and wages. Those with money ‚Äî who included new poor as well as new or old rich ‚Äî had recourse to the market to add sugar and spice to their existence. Carole Shammas observes:

* The changeover made by some many people \[to foreign groceries\] completely reorganized trade and promoted colonization and slavery‚Ä¶. Since Keynes it has been customary to ask about the impact of the state on consumer demand. But in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the casual order was the reverse; consumer demand‚Äôs effects the state.

**But Shammas‚Äôs consumers are not all sovereigns, since she also identifies new proletarianized populations separated from traditional sources of food ‚Äî the family cow or garden plot ‚Äî finding in the new sweetened beverages and confections solace and badly needed calories. The dynamics of civil society were, in fact, shot through with class as well as racial hierarchies.** It is also clear the the new exotic products could be produced in a variety of ways. For over half a century tobacco was cultivated mainly by free farmers and European indentured servants. **Most of what became the typical slave plantation crops ‚Äî cotton, indigo, coffee and even sugar ‚Äî could be grown and/or processed using free or indentured labour. It was merchants and planters above all who decided how the demand for plantation produce would be met, and in contexts they had helped to shape.** In Chapter VIII I ask whether they could have chosen any differently. **Independent small producers, native communities free or indentured migrants generally lacked much influence on governments or the sort of help or protection that might have given them leverage against the merchant and planter elite.**

One way of securing social inclusion and **fixing identity** in early modern Europe was national allegiance. But national sentiment does not fully explain why some could be enslaved and others not. **The traders and the New World colonists felt their way towards new systems of racial classification, inventing not one but several racisms, as we will see, successively refining the identity of the colonial and slaveholding community as ‚ÄòChristian‚Äô, ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô, and ‚Äòwhite‚Äô. While national identities came to mobilize one European people against another, they were not thought to justify the enslavement of the subjects of another monarch or the citizens of another state; and under normal conditions the same consideration was even extended to the subjects of a Muslim monarch. By contrast the new racisms furnished critical principles of domestic subordination within the civil society of the colonies. African captives were deemed stateless and acquired as chattels; they then became part of the slaveholding household.** Once a slave was acquired by a new owner then they also acquired their owner‚Äôs national belonging, becoming, in common parlance, ‚Äòan English Negro‚Äô or ‚Äòa French Negro‚Äô. In the early modern period many suffered degrees of social and political exclusion and only a minority of adult males, together with a few widows, could exercise the rights of a head of household. **The status of the slave was thus a limiting case of a species of exclusion to which women, minors, and those with little or no property were subject. And the racial sentiment animating it can be linked, as Benedict Anderson suggests in a similar case, to class rather than nation.**

**The conjunction of modernity and slavery is awkward and challenging since the most attractive element in modernity was always the promise it held out of greater personal freedom and self-realization**. The late medieval communes produced an aspiration to citizenship which gave early expression to this notion of civic freedom; it was often claimed that the ‚Äòfree air‚Äô of the municipality dissolved the bonds of servitude. The Reformation yielded a religious version of this promise with its notion of the role of individual conscience. **The rise of distinctive ‚Äònations‚Äô, first among students and merchants and then among wider layers in the population gave birth to the idea that the people realized their freedom in the creation of a national community. National sentiment, promising notional liberty, or even share in sovereignty, to each member of the nation, was to part of the structure of modernity as it emerged in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. But property and patriarchy qualified this promise and effectively excluded slaves from it altogether.** Free blacks were inclined to claim civic rights but when they did so had to contend with white colonists; the colonial state sometimes deemed it appropriate or convenient to accord at least some rights to free people of colour as a way of stimulating their loyalty. But the slave was effectively beyond the reach of the colonial state.

Within the new secular space opened up by modernity, slavery was throw into dramatic and negative relief. From some time in the seventeenth century this word became among the most frequently used in the vocabulary of social or political agitation. It is therefore all the more puzzling that slavery was developed to its greatest extent in the New World precisely by the peoples of North Western Europe who most detested it at home. They saw in slavery a notion of intense and comprehensive domination that was the antithesis of citizenship and self-respect. Of course, the notion of the free wage labourer was at an early stage of development, with many aspiring to the role of independent small producer or artisan. The labourer who was able to depend on regular wages to meet all his or her subsistence costs, and hence able to live without independent means of existence or other claims to support, represented a particular outcome of a lengthy and contested social development. In the sixteenth century the hired servant might have some land or instruments of a trade; on the other hand, they might owe service for years at a time. The master often had the right to administer physical punishment; on the other hand, the labourer could appeal to a variety of customary rights *vis-a-vis* an employer. **The popular notion of the condition of the slave was one in which he or she was stripped bare of all customary rights and independent means of existence, and thus subordinated to the naked, perpetual and comprehensive domination of the master. In the course of this book it will be shown that this was indeed the formal statute of enslavement in the Americas, but that other opposed or different tendencies were also at work, many of them difficult to identify with the aid of the formal juridical concepts of European chattel slavery. The African captives brought with them skills and expectations that helped them to survive, adapt and ultimately challenge or undermine the modern European notion of enslavement. The innovation of colonial slavery was launched by European merchants and planters, then ratified by jurists or statesmen; ultimately, it created new identities and new solidarities which different jurists and political leaders saw advantage in recognizing.**

**The social relations of colonial slavery borrowed from an ancient stock of legal formulas, used contemporary techniques of violence, developed manufacture and maritime transport on a grand scale, and anticipated modern modes of co-ordination and consumption. Slavery in the New World was above all a hybrid mixing ancient and modern, European business and African husbandry, American and Eastern plants and processes, elements of traditional patrimonialism with up-to-date bookkeeping and individual ownership. The key crops ‚Äî maize and manioc as well as tobacco, sugar, coffee, indigo, and so forth ‚Äî had been unknown in Europe, and the means of producing, processing and consuming them had to be learned from others. These borrowings necessarily involved innovation and adaptation, as new social institutions and practices, as well as new crops and techniques of cultivation, were arranged in new ensembles. The tests of war and market survival brought about a ‚Äòhistorical selection‚Äô of social institutions and practices ‚Äî one which, for a considerable time, favoured plantation slavery. The institution of colonial slavery furnished a potent if unstable momentum to the whole complex ‚Äî for a while.**

The intricate and enforced co-ordination of labour required by the production of the new plantation staples ‚Äî the art of sugar-boiling, with its seven different cooper basins ‚Äî had about it a baroque complexity and art. The versatility and luxury of white-sugar confections became a staple of aristocratic display; as plantation production brought down the price, the consumption of sugar spread to broader layers of the population while continuing to supply the icing to ceremonial cakes on special occasions. Polite rituals such as the taking of sweetened coffee, tear or ‚Äòbaroque chocolate‚Äô (a brew made with species) also spread down the social scale.

Nevertheless, because the new exotic produces were associated with the advent of new popular pleasures, there was also movement in the other direction. The particular drugs and stimulants that flourished were not necessarily those approved by the authorities ‚Äî most of whom disapproved of tobacco until they tumbled to its revenue-raising possibilities. The taste for smoking, chewing, or snuffing tobacco was brought back to Europe by seamen and adventurers. It was the first exotic luxury to become an article of mass consumption. At the same time, the pleasure principle was seemingly disciplined by a need for self-control. Tobacco, like tea or coffee, was stimulating without befuddling or numbing the sense. In Chapter VI **it will be suggested that such stimulants were eventually selected because they were compatible with alertness and control, and allayed the appetite**. **The plantations also produced cotton and dyestuffs that soon influenced middle-class and even popular apparel ‚Äî especially in the Netherlands and Britain, which were the pacesetters in the new bourgeois world of consumption. Although the new civility often aped the court, its dynamic spread the consumption of plantation produce into every crevice of the new money economy. The growth of capitalism in Europe thus sucked in a stream of exotic commodities, which themselves helped to sugar the often bitter pill of wage dependence.**

**From the Baroque to the Creole**

<[**Tiempo De Vals**](https://youtu.be/j3ObHjm1fAE?si=snwMbYBinppuCddv)>

One term for evoking the ethos and aspirations of early European colonialism is ‚Äòthe baroque‚Äô. **This word, originally referring to a misshapen pearl and then applied to tortuously elaborate demonstrations in scholastic logic became attached to the discrepant, bizarre and exotic features of post-Renaissance culture. It was finally adopted to evoke those principles of power and harmony which could reconcile such discordant elements. The baroque appears in a Europe confronting Ottoman might and discovering the material culture of Asia, Africa, and America. It is first sponsored by the Jesuits, the Counter-Reformation and the Catholic monarchs and courts in an attempt to meet the challenge of Puritans, though subsequently some Protestant monarchs also adopted aspects of the baroque.** Xavier Ruben de Ventos, writing of the consequences of the colonization of the Americas observes:

* **The baroque generally ‚Äî and more singularly in Spain ‚Äî seems to be an attempt to retain the classical ideals in a world in which everything seems to overwhelm them: a portentous effort to contain elements from overflowing any figurative perimeter. Against all the odds, baroque artists try to offer a tangible translation of a world torn apart by Christianity, aggrandised by the Church and disjointed by monetary economy, and thrown off centre by cosmological and geographical discoveries.**

In a similar way, Carl Friedrich links the baroque to the world of colonial slavery:

* Looking back upon this period of colonial expansion, it is not difficult to perceive that the spreading of the Gospel, the lure of gold and silver, strategic considerations, the need for outlets for surplus population, the search for raw materials and markets, the effort to increase governmental revenue and naval training, together with the psychology of adventure and escape, all played their roles, in fact and in propaganda. The lust for power, the basic motif of the baroque age, was involved in all of them. But not only the lust *for,* but even more perhaps the revelling *in,* the gorgeous feeling *of,* power were most wonderfully at work in this field. If one confronts the slave trader and the Puritan, ‚Äòthe ‚Äòget-rich-quick‚Äô speculator and the Quaker mystic and pacifist as they sailed the seven seas and expanded Europe until it circled the globe, one beholds once more the basic polarities of the baroque. Both the search for inward and outward power propelled the colonial expansion of Europe‚Ä¶

Expanding the concept of the baroque to embrace also the Puritans and Quakers gives an undue latitude to the term, since ‚Äî Jose Maravall has argued ‚Äî **the baroque really represented an alternative modernity to that associated with the Puritan ethic, and exulted in species of display that the Puritans detested.**

**Since the baroque had a special link to the Counter-Reformation, it loomed larger in Catholic than in Protestant countries, and everywhere it was associated with royal and aristocratic display, focusing on a utopia of harmony, a cornucopia of abundance and a diorama of elegance.** It is in the baroque painting that the figure of the black page is often found, gazing gratefully at the master or mistress, or placidly at the viewer. The baroque favoured a sanitized and controlled vision of civil society. While Louis XIV‚Äôs *Code Noir* sought to instantiate a species of justice within the world of slavery, the Portuguese Jesuit ‚Äî and sometimes royal chaplain ‚Äî Antonio Vieira delivered a masterpiece of baroque prose denouncing the cruel slaveowners and exalting their victims. **Ultimately the courtly baroque wished to tame the wilful slaveowner rather than yield him all the power he craved. While the baroque as spectacle retained a link to the world of colonial slavery, it exhibited a public entrepreneurship, the positive face of mercantilism, which contrasted with the private enterprise that was the driving force behind the New World‚Äôs civil slavery. Vieira was also the architect of the Brazil Company, a chartered body which helped to save the colony for Portugal.**

**The planters of the English Caribbean and North America, where slavery proved most dynamic, were plunged in a workaday world and made fewer concessions to their subject peoples than the kings of Spain or Portugal.** But they saw themselves as sovereigns of all they surveyed, and occasionally patronized the diversions of their people. **The Great Houses of the planters received African adornments, while echoing the Palladian mansions of English or French aristocracy, the latter in their turn being influenced by Versailles. Since plantation cultivation destroyed the forests, the planters had little difficulty finding sites with commanding views. They built not fortresses or castles but theatres of gracious living. The religion and culture of the Protestant and Anglo-Saxon slave colonies were resistant to cultural admixture ‚Äî though, as we will argue in Chapter XI, this was by no means absent, even in Virginia.** While the planters supplied the necessary ingredients of the new bourgeois lifestyles, they themselves cultivated the dignity of gentlemen. **There were not a few learned colonial planters, connoisseurs of Indian customs and artifacts, whose explorations can be seen as projects of cultural mastery or, more sympathetically, as efforts to transcend European models and to discover an American identity.**

Tzvetan Todorov has argued that the Spanish *conquistadores* combined an ability to enter the world of the pre-Colombian societies, playing ruthlessly and skilfully on their internal fault lines, with a lust for gold and cultural arrogance which repressed the basic humanity of the conquered. Typically, the European colonists portrayed themselves as engaged in a mission of civilization, saving the ‚Äògood‚Äô natives from the ‚Äòbad‚Äô natives who preyed upon them. In this splitting of the ‚ÄòOther‚Äô the bad native was inherently vicious, given to cannibalism (a word derived from the name of the Carib people) and other unspeakable practices; the ‚Äògood‚Äô native, on the other hand, still required the tutelage as well as protection of the Conqueror. The subsequent process of building colonial systems retain many of the characteristics identified by Todorov, but involved a proliferation ‚Äî a baroque proliferation ‚Äî of identities built up by polyphonic counterpoint.

The African slave was different from the conquered Indian, and within both categories many distinctions were made. The Spanish permitted - or even encouraged - **the Indians and Africans of different** ***naciones*** **to parade in distinctive dress, sometimes an adaption of Spanish peasant costume with Indo-American or Afro-American folkloric elaboration, on royal feast days. With the plantation system the planters liked to distinguish different African peoples, to whom real or imagined skills and temperaments were attributed.** Thus English planters favoured ‚ÄòCoromantins‚Äô ‚Äî their term for the Akan people of West Africa ‚Äî for their initiative, hardiness and bravery, but also feared their propensity to revolt. **At least twenty different African people were regularly distinguished by French planters in Saint Domingue, and there were significant differences in the kinds of work assigned to them. These African ‚Äònations‚Äô were conceived of roughly on the model of European nations, without registering the complex of kinship relations, thus actually bringing about the reduction of a complex identity to a simple one.** The mixed or mulatto populations were elaborately classified: the French planter-*philosophe* Moreau de St-Mery produced a table of separate terms distinguishing 128 different categories of mixed blood. The Portuguese authorities organized the following separate companies of free persons of colour in eighteenth-century Minas Gerais: *pardo e bastardos forros* (free mulattoes and half-castes), *pretos e pardos forros* (free blacks and mulattoes), *pretos e mesticos forros* (free blacks and free mixed-bloods), *indios e bastardos* (Indians and half-castes). **Colonial slavery was thus typically accompanied by a complex hierarchy of Others, and the stance towards the enslaved Other was that of instrumentalization rather than simple suppression or exclusion, fates which were reserve for the incorrigible ‚Äòbad native‚Äô**.

**The baroque sought to address the impact of other cultures upon Europe, a feature that was particularly pronounced in the Americas. The colonial baroque generally acquired a syncretistic and popular character by comparison with the metropolitan baroque of Versailles or a royal procession on the Thames, though the public display of power was common to both. In the Andes, Mexico and Brazil, indigenous or African themes were incorporated in objects of religious devotion; gold and silver were plentifully applied, asserting a primacy of symbolic value over exchange value. The baroque even promised an aestheticized and transfigured world beyond that of an oppressive mundane reality.**

**Those elements of the baroque which implied any restraint on the commercial dynamic of plantation slavery were gradually whittled away by the relentless pressure of military and economic competition between slave systems. The slave systems of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries became attuned to more industrial rhythms, losing first their baroque and then their colonial features.** But these processes also brought into view the informal work of cultural and productive synthesis underlying the productivity synthesis underlying the productivity of the slave systems. **The colonial version of the baroque anticipated elements of the creole. The creole mixtures thrown up by plantation development became increasingly confident and coherent, escaping beyond European forms and models. The African coastal depots, the Atlantic island reprovisioning points, the American ports, plantations, marketplaces and backlands were new spaces, and they gave rise to new languages, new musics, new religions and new laws. They gave birth to the creole, to mixtures of European, African and Amerindian elements. While the colonial baroque articulated and qualified slavery ‚Äòfrom above‚Äô, the creole sometimes did so ‚Äòfrom below‚Äô. The term creole was used of the American-born, whether white or black or every shade between, though the emphasis was to shift according to place and period. It originated, however, from the Spanish** ***criada,*** **or nurse, thus implying that** ***criollo*** **was suckled as well as born in the Americas, very possibly by an Indian or African nurse.** It seems appropriate that the new forms of life born in the colonies are often called creole, with the more or less conscious realization that they represented a new synthesis or mixture, arrived at through the struggles within and between the various components of the colonial population. Within narrow limits creolization could qualify slavery. **But without some more or less revolutionary emancipation, the creole impulse was caged.**

From *Eternal Hermes* by Antoine Faivre,

‚ÄúHermes-Mercury‚Äôs plasticity allowed him to take on a special form at the beginning of our era, bringing out his most serious and least playful aspect. This was his manifestation as Hermes Trismegistus, which remains alive to this day. Two factors seem to have been involved in it. On the one hand, there was the allegorical interpretation of mythology that began with Homeric exegesis in the fourth century BCE, and tended increasingly towards euhemerism. (Euhemerus, third century BCE, saw the gods as actual human beings who were divinized after death.) This led to a belief in Hermes as a historic person who had been divinized: a tendency reinforced by Christian thought, which was resolutely from the second century onwards <Copyist note: Lukumi phrase, ‚ÄúIku lobi ocha‚Äù del muerto nace el santo, from the dead the saints/divinities are born>. The second factor was the attraction of Graeco-Roman paganism towards ancient Egypt: part of the need that the Greeks felt for exalting Barbarian philosophy to the detriment of their own. This attraction was reinforced by the existence of a Greek culture in Alexandria, firmly installed on Egyptian soil in the land of pyramids and hieroglyphs. Around the beginning of our era, the Greeks justifiably saw in Thoth the first figuration of Hermes, or even the same personage under a different name. Aided by the euhemerist tendency, Thoth-Mercury was credited with a great number of books‚Äîquite real ones‚Äîunder the general title of *Hermetica.* Almost all of them were written in Greek, in the Nile Delta region, from just before the Christian Era until the third century; they treat astrology, alchemy, and theosophy. The most famous ones, from the second and third centuries CE, are grouped under the general title of the *Corpus Hermeticum,* in which the *Asclepius* and the Fragments collected by Stobeaus have been included. But a more fantastic tradition attributed thousands of other works to Hermes Trismegistus.‚Äù

<‚Ä¶>

The servitude of the slaves, imprisoned on a tiny patch of soil and forced to devote nearly all their waking time to furnishing the conveniences and luxuries of a diverse metropolitan population, was the transatlantic complement of European economic advance. Captive Africans and their descendants paid with their blood and sweat and incarceration for the phenomenal expansion of human possibilities in the Atlantic world. This is how it happened. But was it the inescapable and ‚Äònecessary‚Äô price of economic advance? If it was a necessary price, then it might even appear, at this distance in time, a price worth paying.

The problem with such a view is that the human costs of slavery continue to be paid in the poisonous legacies it bequeathed. The slavery of the colonial epoch was associated with a new species of racialization, a predatory and destructive mode of production and an oblivious and irresponsible mode of consumption. I believe we must scrutinize all the various causal links in the chains of American slavery. Their complexity and counterpoint could have yielded a variety of outcomes. At each moment in the construction of the slave systems there were forms of resistance, queries and objections, even proposals that matters be arranged differently. Because of the fact that these systems of slavery had to provide for the reproduction of some human resources, as well as wastefully consuming them, new social subjects were produced in the Atlantic zone, with their own proposals and forms of life. New sources of productivity were being tapped, new needs met, and new motivations discovered. Would it not have been possible to combine these in ways which avoided the systematic, onerous and destructive coercion of American slavery and the Atlantic slave trade? The history reconstructed below will on occasion seek to identify signs and possibilities that other paths of development were considered, and might have been chosen. Even if some such clues can be detected, we are left with what happened. Yet some daylight is admitted to the modernity-slavery couplet by acknowledging the possibility that there might have been a path to modernity that avoided the enormity of enslavement and its contemporary legacy.

- 
There is rain. There‚Äôs always rain. Will it ever stop raining? I peered out into the wet greyness of a typical Thursday afternoon. My eyes traced the glare from the sickly white 
fluorescent lighting of the classroom, fading into hundreds of trails created by water droplets dancing down the window creating dull patterns. 

 ''Scarlett?'' 
 My gaze tore from the window and went to the front of the room, my mind snapping slowly back to reality; I noticed a few heads glowering at me in obvious annoyance.

 ''Yes, Mr. Moreno?'' I nonchalantly replied. 
 He stared at me with a face, mouth set in disapproval while setting a pile of papers down on his desk beside him. Just as he started to move his lips to say something a knock on the door sounded and took us all by surprise. Almost immediately, the door opened and a petite woman with dark aging hair and a business suit strode in. Her glasses sat on the tip of her short nose, eyes flashing with urgency. Before fully passing through the doorway she started to exam a 
check board with some papers clipped to it, and cleared her throat. 

 ""Scarlett Calderon?''
 My fingers started to tingle while my stomach dropped. I raised my hand. She told me to collect my things and follow her. I obeyed. I shut my books, jammed them into my bag and slung it over my shoulder. I kept my mouth shut and eyes glued to the floor while exiting the classroom, trying my best to avoid my classmates and especially Mr. Moreno. As horrible as I felt someone had come to fetched me. I had no choice. My vision slipped to share one short glace at Moreno, his brows furrowed in what looked like worry or sadness. I tried not to think about it, pushing it out of my mind. 
 
 We walked through the corridor in silence. I didn't have the means to ask her why she'd removed me from class.. I couldn't ask. I stared at all the faded pastel purple and blue lockers, counting them to keep my mind off of what could be waiting for me. I tucked my binder under my arm and pressed it into my chest while I gripped my bag strap tighter. Walking into the front office the stink of old coffee and printer ink hit me. The smell was disgustingly unnatural and 
somehow made my anxiety feel even worse. I was lead into a small room with four chairs and a table dividing them, the walls were an overly positive yellow and the carpet grey, smelling stale, almost like a thrift shop. The woman seated me and told me to wait, rushing out the door with her back turned towards me. Unlike in the classroom, she showed no emotion or life to me here. She was just like all the other employees the school had hired: human robots.

 I let out a deep sigh, dropping my bag onto the floor and tossing my binder onto the glass table, not caring to be careful. Leaning into the chair, I closed my eyes and massaged the bridge of my nose. 

 ''I can't take much more of this..'' My dry eyes started to sting reacting to the growing parched lump in my throat that I couldn't manage to swallow. Sharp pains invaded my temples while the back of my head throbbed crazily. Although I was alone in a room, I felt overwhelmed and claustrophobic. The ringing sound had started again, like a very low buzzing you hear from street lamps at night on a quiet street. It echoed in the back of my head, out of sync with the constant throbbing of my head. I threw my head into my hands, sinking into the chair, hoping something or someone could stop the pain.

 ''Ms. Calderon?'' A soft but low male voice sounded by the door. 
 I lifted my head while nodding and stood up off my seat, trying to straighten myself out. I coughed my throat free and introduced myself. 

 ''I'm Scarlett Calderon,'' My voice sounded husky and old, I had almost face-palmed myself. 

The man nodded in agreement, as if he'd already known. From what I could tell, judging by his dark grey hair and creased shadows that ran around his eyes and mouth that the man was probably in his mid-forties.

 ''I know who you are Ms. Calderon,'' a small smile perked on his lips. ''May I call you Scarlett?'' 

 ''Umm.. Yes, of course.''

 ''Well then, Scarlett,'' He studied me warily and stood across from me, on the other side of the table. ''Do you know why you're here?'' he questioned sincerely, but from the look on my face I'm sure he already knew I didn't.

 ''No, I'm sorry, but nobody has said anything to me since I was pulled from class a few minutes ago.'' I tried to look calm but my nerves started to kick in. I was failing at the charade.

 ''Of course,'' He brushed his hand on his pant leg. ''I should introduce myself first.'' He held out his hand gesturing a handshake, face reassuring. 

 My hands started to tingle again. Adrenaline danced in my fingertips, quickly spilling upward into my arms. The dull throbbing sensation that I had forgotten about had returned. As I reached out my hand to shake his, pain shot through my skull and down my spine. I inhaled sharply and doubled over, fighting back the sudden urge of nausea and cradling my head in my hands. The low-pitched buzzing got louder again. Flashes of light blinded my vision and white noise made me deaf to the commotion around me. Two strong hands grabbed my shoulders and a gust of wind passed my face. My hands dropped from my head and were now touching the carpet. I had collapsed. 

 The two hands rolled me onto my back. I felt weak and sick, my body hurt all over like I had taken on a gang and got beaten up. When I opened my eyes everything was so bright, I couldn't move my mouth or hear anything specific. I saw the ceiling, the hanging lamp, and in the background I heard distorted voices of a male and possibly a female shouting. I closed my eyes; everything was slowly being drowned out by the now high-pitched white noise ringing in my ears and the dark salvation behind my eyelids. Wetness poured down the sides of my cheeks, tickling my ears. I could feel my heart slow and my breathing shallow. I didn't care anymore, why fight the pain when you can just hide from it, turn it off. I let the cold gloom of my mind take over, enveloping me and the fading pain. I escaped to a dreamless sleep, uninvolved and uninterested in the world and its happenings around me.",1,1728119387.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

1fwmai1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BGodInspired/comments/1fwmai1/faith_in_action_bridging_the_divide_a_devotional/,Faith in Action: Bridging the Divide ‚Äî A Devotional Journey Toward Racial Reconciliation,"https://bgodinspired.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1728118580.png

### Devotional: Faith in Action‚ÄîBridging the Divide

**Scripture Focus:**

‚ÄúBlessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called children of God.‚Äù ‚Äì Matthew 5:9 (ESV)

#### Reflection:

In our world today, the concept of racial reconciliation often feels like an insurmountable challenge. We see divisions rooted in fear, misunderstanding, and a long history of prejudice. Yet, as followers of Christ, we are called to be active participants in bridging these divides. Our faith must translate into action, guiding us to work towards justice, understanding, and healing within our communities.

In Matthew 5:9, Jesus reminds us that peacemaking is a divine calling. It is not simply the absence of conflict but an intentional effort to restore relationships, heal wounds, and create a more equitable society. This week, let us embark on a journey of reconciliation‚Äîa journey rooted in faith and driven by love.

#### Education:

1. **Understanding the History**: To work towards reconciliation, it is essential to understand the historical context of racial divides. Explore the stories and experiences of those whose voices have been marginalized. This education fosters empathy and is foundational in acknowledging the pain and injustice faced by individuals and communities.
2. **Listening and Learning**: Practice active listening with individuals from different racial and cultural backgrounds. This isn‚Äôt merely about hearing their words but genuinely seeking to understand their perspectives and experiences. Make an effort to engage in conversations that may feel uncomfortable but are necessary for growth and understanding.
3. **Active Participation**: Join or support initiatives aimed at promoting racial justice and reconciliation. Whether it‚Äôs volunteering at community organizations addressing these issues, taking part in peaceful protests, or simply advocating for equitable practices in your local context, remember that your actions can be a powerful testament of your faith.

#### Encouragement:

As we take steps toward reconciliation, remember that this journey is not one you must embark on alone. God promises His presence as we navigate through turbulent waters. In Romans 12:18, we are encouraged, ‚ÄúIf possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.‚Äù This verse drives home the importance of personal responsibility while recognizing that we cannot control others‚Äô actions or reactions.

Embrace the tension that comes with this journey. Conflict can be a catalyst for growth, pushing us to confront our biases and assumptions. Allow God to soften your heart, letting love and compassion guide your responses. As you engage with others, be reminded that every step toward reconciliation‚Äîno matter how small‚Äîis a step in faith.

#### Prayer:

Heavenly Father, we come before You with hearts open to understanding and compassion. Help us to see each person through the lens of Your love, transcending our differences and embracing the call to be peacemakers. Empower us to act‚Äînot just in words but in deeds‚Äîthat we may bridge divides and promote reconciliation within our communities. Thank You for the example of Christ, who demonstrated perfect love and unity. May our actions reflect that same love. In Jesus‚Äô name, we pray. Amen.

#### Action Step:

This week, take one intentional step toward racial reconciliation. It could involve reaching out to a diverse friend for a coffee chat, participating in a local event focused on community healing, or reading a book that sheds light on racial issues. Reflect on your experience, and be prepared to share your insights with others. Every action, however small, builds the foundation for a reconciled society.

- - - - - -

May this devotional inspire you to take bold steps in faith, actively participating in the critical work of racial reconciliation. In unison, let‚Äôs strive towards a more just and equitable world, reflecting the love of Christ in all we do.

Morgan's alarm chirped at 4:44 AM, harmonizing briefly with the irregular hum of Dotty's temporal variance detector down the hall. They could already smell burning ozone - never a good sign before coffee.

""Hey house-consciousness, lights at 20%,"" Morgan mumbled, then remembered they'd never actually had a house AI. That was just Vec's latest failed attempt at neural-architecture, currently collecting dust in the corner. They clicked on the bedside lamp manually, like a caveman.

The kitchen was its usual disaster zone. Doc was passed out face-down on their makeshift breakfast bar (really just a repurposed quantum computing chassis), surrounded by scattered components and at least three different empty energy drink cans. Their latest project - something about proving P=NP using crystal matrices - softly pulsed with bioluminescence.

""Doc. Doc!"" Morgan shook their shoulder gently. ""You're drooling on your theorems again.""

""Mmfgh... five more minutes... almost got the proof...""

Morgan sighed, carefully sliding a coaster under the slowly expanding puddle. They'd learned the hard way that some of Doc's mathematical proofs were water-soluble.

The coffee maker (the only appliance Morgan insisted on keeping strictly non-modified) gurgled to life just as a muffled explosion rattled the bathroom door.

""Everything's fine!"" Zip's voice called out preemptively. ""Just a minor miscalculation in the shower's probability drive! Water pressure should normalize in about... three parallel timelines from now!""

Morgan checked their watch. 5:03 AM. They needed to be at the coffee shop by 5:45, and they could hear Kit starting up their sonic meditation chamber in the living room - which always made the toast taste like jazz for some reason.

""Hey, while you're all technically conscious,"" Morgan called out, pulling on their work shoes, ""remember we need the rent by Friday. Real money this time - landlord still won't accept cryptocurrency, alternate timeline dollars, or proofs of theoretical economic systems.""

A chorus of distracted agreements echoed from various corners of the apartment. Morgan grabbed their bag, carefully stepping over what looked like a small temporal paradox manifesting near the coat rack.

Just another morning in apartment 4D (sometimes E, depending on Zip's experiments). Morgan paused at the door, looking back at their disaster of a home and its brilliant, hopeless occupants with a mixture of exasperation and fondness.

Someone had to keep them all tethered to reality. Might as well be the barista.

Morning Disaster Protocol

Morgan's second job started at 2 PM, which meant they had exactly 47 minutes to deal with whatever Vec had done to themselves before the lunch rush at the coffee shop ended. They found Vec in their usual corner, surrounded by screens showing incomprehensible neural mapping diagrams, slumped over their workstation with what looked like a modified VR headset fused to their temples.

""Vec?"" Morgan knocked on the doorframe. ""Your plants are trying to solve differential equations again.""

No response, but Vec's fingers were twitching in that familiar pattern they used when manipulating neural interfaces. The air smelled like ozone and burnt coffee, which was never a good combination.

Morgan sighed and activated the room's emergency protocol (basically just a big red button they'd installed after The Consciousness Feedback Loop Incident of Last Thursday). ""Doc! Need you in Vec's room. Bringing cognitive theory worksheets and possibly a fire extinguisher!""

Doc materialized from their quantum computing nest, clutching an energy drink that definitely wasn't legal in this timeline. ""They tried linking with the house systems again?""

""Worse, I think. Look at these patterns."" Morgan pointed to one of the screens, where something that looked like a cross between a Mandelbrot set and a migraine was pulsing in irregular rhythms. ""That's not house AI behavior.""

Doc's eyes widened. ""Oh shit. That's... that's not ANY behavior. That's like if consciousness had consciousness. Vec, what did you DO?""

Vec's fingers kept twitching, forming words in their shared apartment sign language: BEAUTIFUL. FRACTALS. RECURSIVE. HELP.

""They've created some kind of feedback loop between their neural mapping software and... something else,"" Doc muttered, already pulling up command lines on three different holographic displays. ""It's like they found a consciousness pattern that doesn't match anything we know, and instead of documenting it properly...""

""They tried to interface with it directly,"" Morgan finished, already reaching for their phone. ""I'm calling in sick to the shop. Get Zip and Dot or Com, whichever one they are right now - we need containment protocols before whatever Vec found starts affecting the local reality grid. Again.""

""On it."" Doc paused. ""Um, should we call someone? Like, authorities or...?""

Morgan looked at the growing fractal patterns now spreading across Vec's screens, then at their friends' very illegal quantum computing setup, then at the definitely-not-approved neural interface equipment currently fused to Vec's head. ""Let's... keep this in-house for now.""

Vec's fingers twitched again: SORRY ABOUT RENT THIS MONTH.

""We'll discuss that later,"" Morgan sighed, already rolling up their sleeves. ""First let's make sure you haven't accidentally discovered digital eldritch horror. Again.""

Crisis Management Protocol

By 4:37 PM, Morgan had Vec's consciousness untangled from what turned out to be a quantum-entangled spam email (though ""email"" was a generous term for something that existed in seven dimensional space-time simultaneously). The neural interface headset had finally detached itself after Morgan made the extremely educated guess of offering it a better processing substrate - namely, the vintage GameBoy Color that Dot kept insisting was ""technically a quantum computer if you think about it wrong enough.""

They'd just finished disinfecting the neural contact points on Vec's temples with actual medical equipment (Morgan insisted on keeping real first aid supplies in the apartment, not just Doc's experimental nanobots) when the front door chimed. Not the normal chime - the specific seven-note sequence that meant someone official was about to ruin their day.

""Department of Temporal Variance,"" a voice called out. ""We've detected some unusual readings from this location.""

Morgan looked at the small temporal paradox still quietly existing by the coat rack, at Vec's neural mapping equipment (definitely not licensed), at Doc's quantum computing setup (absolutely not approved), and at Dot's sonic meditation chamber (technically legal but only because no one had thought to make laws about it yet).

They had approximately forty seconds before the DTV agent's probability field override would unlock their door. Morgan took a deep breath, straightened their coffee shop apron (they hadn't had time to change), and did what they did best - damage control.

""Places, everyone,"" Morgan whispered urgently. ""Vec, wipe your logs. Doc, quantum shutdown, now. Dot, I need your best reality harmonization field, make it subtle. Zip!"" They looked around. ""Where's Zip?""

""Present timeline or generally?"" Doc asked, already poking at his wrist-watch and powering down systems.

The door chimed again. Morgan closed their eyes for a moment, centered themselves, then opened the door with their best customer service smile. ""Hi! Sorry for the delay. We were just about to file a variance report actually. You see, one of our quantum physics graduate students was conducting an approved eigenstate observation experiment, but our cat got into the lab space and, well..."" They gestured apologetically at the coat rack paradox, which chose that moment to hiccup in a very feline manner.

The DTV agent, a tired-looking woman in a chrono-stabilized suit, peered at her probability meter. ""These readings show-""

""Oh! Before I forget,"" Morgan interrupted smoothly, pulling out a coffee shop loyalty-royalty punch card. ""We're running a special at Temporal Grounds this week. One free coffee for all DTV agents. I know you folks have been working overtime with all the amateur time machine incidents lately.""

The agent paused, looked at her meter again, then at the punch card, then at Morgan's perfectly innocuous coffee shop apron. In the background, Dot's reality harmonization field was making everything feel just slightly more normal than normal.

""I... suppose this could have been a standard variance echo from an authorized experiment,"" the agent said slowly. ""Especially with an untrained quantum observer involved."" She glanced at the coat rack again. ""The cat will reintegrate with linear time in a few hours?""

""Already scheduled to collapse back to a single timeline by midnight,"" Morgan assured her. ""Right Doc?"" Doc nodded from the background, cracking another energy drink, ""We'll have all the paperwork filed by morning.""

After the agent left, Morgan closed the door and slid down against it with a heavy sigh. The coat rack paradox made an apologetic sound.

""So,"" Vec said from their doorway, still a bit wobbly, ""about that rent situation...""

Morgan looked up at their brilliant, disaster-prone housemates. ""You know what? New house rule. Next person who almost breaks reality has to cover my shifts at the coffee shop for a week. I need a vacation.""

""Fair,"" Doc admitted.

""Completely reasonable,"" Dot agreed.

Somewhere in the apartment, several timelines over, they heard Zip sneeze.

Morgan checked their watch. 5:15 PM. Still time to make their evening shift at the auto shipping center help desk. Just another day in apartment 4D.

I am making espresso for some time now and primarily enjoy espressi from medium to dark roasts. From time to time, I include a small bag of lighter roasted beans in my order, because most specialty roasters focus on them and the flavor notes always sound interesting. So far, however, this hasn't been a love story. I rarely taste differences. It's always the same sour ""light roast taste"". I've played around with all kinds of parameters. Tried higher brew ratios up to 1:3, turned the temperature on my PID controlled machine to the maximum and used brewing times ranging from 25s up to 45 or 50s. It just doesn't improve significantly to me. While my grinder could be much better (I use a Kingrinder K6 for lighter roasts), I doubt that a change would cause a completely different taste. There is no channeling and everything looks like it should look. Is there something else other people tried that made a significant difference? I see in videos that people like Tim Wendelboe do not really seem to do something special and even pull with a 1:2 ratio and 8 bars straight. No special profile or pre-infusions. Is it an acquired taste and common not to like it immediately? Is it maybe apparent from what I write that light roast espresso just isn't for me? 

I plan to go to more specialty cafes but even there I am often not sure if they really get everything out of the coffee. ",2,1728118994.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôm an international student from an Asian country and the Germany‚Äôs public impressions from us, according to my experience, are greatly loaded with Asian stereotypes and the authoritarian political system (maybe you already know where I‚Äôm from). Though this story happened 1 yr ago, I am still a bit traumatized and wanna know how do you see this.

It was at the semester beginning last year and I just met my new fellows. Though we already know each other, we were still quite like strangers in the first weeks (kinda like colleagues at workplace). And then this happened:

During a lunch break, a German girl in my team asked me how do I say my name in my own language since it‚Äôs not like the western given name-surname style. When I was still trying to explain the whole thing (how to pronounce, the meaning of my name, giving analogs to make it easier to understand), another German guy just cut in our conversation and interrupted me by saying:

‚ÄúOhI don‚Äôt know how to say your name in your language, maybe (the name of the notorious dictator in my country), am I right?‚Äù 

I was shocked. The girl just turned her face to another fellow and started talking with that person immediately. After a few silent, embarrassing moments and this guy saw my reaction, he also turned away to talk with others and I was left alone. The whole thing is even more painful, because personally I‚Äôm against the authoritarianism in my country and was once almost caught by the cops due to a lone-wolf protest at my college. 

Till today, the girl who asked me the question just keeps a ‚Äúpolite borderline‚Äù with me (like greeting and seminar discussions that‚Äôs all), and this guy always keeps himself away from me by any chance, e.g. avoiding any kind of possibility to get together with me (like group assignments, coffee and lunch break), meanwhile he‚Äôs doing pretty well with others like an alpha chad (Fun Fact: in his ‚Äúcircle‚Äù it‚Äôs all Germans). More frustrating is, I heard from other fellows that actually many of these people who‚Äôre sticking with him actually know this issue between me and him, somehow they are still good friends, at least superficially.

I met a couple of them online through an app and told them about a local group I go to. They came along and then we all made friends with a couple of other moms so we have a group of 5 now. We have a group chat and see eachother at the group every week. We have gone for coffee in-between too. Earlier this week I asked if anyone was up for a coffee then following day. Only one person replied saying she had something planned already, she's probably the one I have most in common with and get on best with. The others completely ignored the message which really upset me. I have a lot of PPA and worry that people don't like me, and I was bullied at school so have issues forming friendships. I have tried to wrack my brains to think if I have offended someone or over-shared somehow but I really don't think I have. There hasn't been any further chat since though someone did share an local event that was happening. 

Am I being childish worrying about this? I'm going to find it really awkward to see them again now and we have plans to meet up next week. I really thought I had made some decent friends here but now I'm worried they all don't like me and have a separate chat without me or something. I feel like a teenager!!!

I cried for 3 days straight because I felt like I let myself and family down. On my first attempt, I did not buy my own Archer account, my friend had about 1,000 questions left on her account and she gave it to me because she passed. Nursing school fees were expensive, and I decided to be cheap; I learned the hard way.

¬† On my second attempt, I purchased Archer and did the entire test bank and watched a few videos, and they were helpful but too long. If I did not understand the question, I would write the rationale on flashcards, and watch a Simple Nursing video on it because Nurse Mike is more entertaining to me. I studied 6+ hours in the library 6 days a week, did mock CAT exams every single day, and even uninstalled all of my social media accounts to remain focused. Every day, I listened to Mark K and YouTube videos. Find out what works for you, here are all the test banks I used : Saunders (the software is outdated, but my school paid for it), Archer, Simple Nursing, and NCLEX Bootcamp.¬†

¬† 2 weeks before NCLEX, my Archer subscription ended, and I found out about NCLEX Bootcamp. Their case studies are exactly like the state board and I highly recommend them, and it's only $40 ! I condensed their 1-month study plan into two weeks with the help of God and coffee lol. Y'all I got nervous and bought Uworld‚Äôs 1-month subscription 3 days before my exam and did 700 questions and their assessment to really see if I was prepared.

¬† ¬†On exam day, I packed a little snack; popcorn chips, Starbucks coffee, and peppermints. I drank coffee 1 hour before the exam and another sip right before going in. I kid you not, I didn‚Äôt even take my break at the 2-hour mark and then my exam cut off at 95 questions. Not only that, but I walked out really thinking I failed because on my first attempt my exam ended at 130 questions. I went home and cried and even started studying again lol . 2 days later I paid for quick results and found out I passed. I thank God for giving me an awesome husband and support system. Two weeks from today, I‚Äôll be working in the ER.¬†

My problem is I don't drink dairy and I can't get the oat milk to be fatty/cold enough to stop the espresso from mixing immediately.

I'm a 22m in college, and I have a class with her. Every time I see her I'm absolutely stunned. She's incredibly intelligent, has an entoxicating laugh, and is always dressed to the absolute nines. I really want to try and say something, but I have no idea what/where/how to start. 

We've never really spoken besides just ""hey"" or ""hi"". We have locked eyes or caught each other looking in the past week, but I realize that doesn't mean anything. All I really know about her is that she's pre-med while I'm pre-law. Haven't even learnt her name.

I'm just trying to think of a way to introduce myself and see where things go. I'd like to take her on a date sometime, and I'd like my intentions to be clear, but I don't want to come off as a creep by being to direct.

 I've been out of the dating world for a while, I was just deployed overseas, and the relationship before that was the first I'd been in in almost two years (intentionally single, the prior relationship did not end well and I needed time). But, I am a ""date to marry"" person.

I know that I'm a pretty quiet person. I definitely have issues meeting people, and after previous relationships I like being as straightforward with my intentions as possible. I'm military and used to be a firefighter, but I'd rather run into a burning building again than talk to her and sound like a fool. 

My initial plan was to somehow introduce myself after or maybe before class and just trying to talk and see if there's anything there. If so should I ask her out or let things ""marinate""? I'm kind of old school so my ideal first date go to is usually a nice dinner + scary movie or just grabbing coffee, sometimes I'll ask if they want to learn how to dance (I can country swing dance just enough to be dangerous).

I‚Äôm not going nuts, a 500cal deficit so eating ~1600 calories a day. Is it tough? Yes of course, having to weigh every teaspoon of oil and every few stolen chicken nuggets off my kid‚Äôs leftovers is effort, but it works. 

Probably because I‚Äôm looking at more weight loss stuff but I‚Äôve seen a big uptick in reels where people are swearing blind that they‚Äôre doing CICO correctly, walking 20,000 steps a day and still not losing weight. One particular lady was saying that she weighs every teaspoon of oil she uses and dutifully logs the low cal creamer in her coffee. 

The comments were full of ‚Äúget your hormones checked‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs starvation mode, eat more!‚Äù, ‚Äúsome of us just have a heavier set point‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs PCOS‚Äù. I‚Äôm absolutely positive that having hormonal issues is going to make it harder, but surely the maths still maths? 

I have had success with CICO now and in the past, but I‚Äôll admit to myself when I get sloppy - when I don‚Äôt log that slice of cake, or when I gun a handful of peanuts without weighing it because I‚Äôm fed up. 

I wish I could move in with these people who claim they log everything and walk so many steps and don‚Äôt lose weight, just to see what the deal is. But are there genuinely people that have a metabolism so low that they wouldn‚Äôt lose weight even on 1000 calories and 20,000 steps a day?

And it also frustrates me because for years I listened to the people who talk about starvation mode and it being so hard to lose weight, needing fad diets, when I could‚Äôve been just doing it the simple way.
