1owuyyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1owuyyk/chopped_cheese_mandela_effect/,Chopped Cheese Mandela Effect,"I have lived in NYC for over 20 years, conducted countless research on which bodega has the cheapest coffee in every neighborhood I’ve lived in, gotten many late night deli sandwiches and I swear I’d never once heard of a chopped cheese until a friend was visiting in 2022. 

He said he was dying to finally visit New York and try an authentic chopped cheese.

I had no idea what he was talking about at the time, and consulted with my friend who grew up in the Bronx and has lived in the the city her whole life, and she also had no idea what I was talking about. Specifically she said “WTF is a chopped cheese?!”

Fast forward, I see signs for chopped cheese constantly, and random internet things talking about how iconic it is. 

I’m honestly really bothered by this. How could it be possible that I’d never one registered the existence of what is supposed to be a ‘NYC famous food’ in 20 years? Maybe I’ve blown up in my mind that it’s as iconic as pizza, and it’s really not that big of a deal?

Maybe it’s possible I just never noticed it because it’s probably not something I would order?

Just wanted to hear some thoughts if anyone else just…does not remember ever hearing anything about a chopped cheese until relatively recently? 

I would rather not hear how stupid and oblivious I am, but I am mentally preparing for it.

Entry 1

I worked at a government testing facility. I ran away, leaving my coworkers to clean up the mess. I will not disclose the details of this site, as even if I wanted to host some kind of inspirational raid to stop the atrocities taking place there, you lot wouldn’t get past the first gate. The more details I unveil, the more likely this post will be swiftly covered up and dealt with, as well as my existence. Just assume these are the ramblings of a mad man. This is less of an exposé piece and more of a confessional, praying it may abstain me of my sins. I’m not a religious man but I now know there are things beyond this world, or at the very least, our understanding of it, so I might as well try and cover ass.

I also think it wants me to tell you all about it... I’m not sure. I haven’t been the same since. A throbbing pain permeates inside my skull, clouding my thoughts. It’s a constant pressure from within, sitting behind my eyes, travelling all the way through to the back of my head, caressing me as it fades down my spine. It’s consistency and my nebulous mind has created a constant brain fog, so forgive me if my writing is nonsensical at any point. Again, ramblings of a mad man.

I’ve seen my fair share of horrible things. To be honest, we’re not entirely ethically sound there. The workers’ silent motto is “the ends justify the means”. It helps us all sleep at night if we think we’re doing something for the greater good at the end of the day, finding comfort in some self-imposed moral ambiguity. Yet no amount of mental gymnastics can excuse what we’ve done.

August 19th, a team debrief was held to establish understanding of our next project. Bright and early in the morning my four other colleagues and I filed into the observation room, its interior white like sugar - glistening, pristine surfaces covering every square inch. We gather in the corner, beside the hissing coffee machine, in a queue waiting for our turn. A window into the world we would watch daily filled the wall opposite us. Our debriefer followed us in and stood in front of it. The window and him separated by our workstations, long tables connected and covered in computers and stationery. At first glance it hardly resembled a research lab, more akin to an interrogation room.

Our debriefer read from a clipboard, barely able to see past the mounds of eye bags that rest between his tired gaze and his reading material, droned on about a new, experimental, “revolutionary”, form of communication, lips loose as each word fell out of his mouth. Not a single person in the room was convinced; we all just took notes and followed along begrudgingly like anyone on a Monday morning would. The debriefer looked like Monday morning incarnate. Craig, the man on my right, letting out sigh as he wrote, the woman on my left was visibly rolling her eyes. I’d worked with this team before, some members more than others, and we were no strangers to failed experiments. In fact, I used to work with Craig a lot, and at one point, I even considered him a friend. In recent years, Craig has endured a melancholic depression due to the passing of his wife years ago. Suicide.

Suddenly, what felt like an encore of my morning alarm shook me to attention, waking me more than its predecessor. However, this alarm took the form of a mess of a professor bursting through the door, almost crashing into our desks, then steadying himself as he stood next to our debriefer. A flurry of emotions spewed from this man's demeanor, from frustration to excitement to exhaustion to... paranoia? He was a mess. Untucked shirt, titled glasses, messy hair. He had the eyes of a man lacking sleep, as well as the desire to do so. Yet his chin held so high all he could do is look down on us. As if he could grace the gods themselves. He did not have an ego or high self-esteem. His sin was the pride he had for his work.

“This is no ordinary communication technique!” He announced, emphasizing his words with dramatic hand movements. “Listen well please. I have designed a quick procedure that alters minds. You can think of it as a form of mental walkie-talkie, if you wish to keep your view skewed, just know that it is so much more than that. They have unlocked, um-” a brief pause, lost in thought. “No, actually, I won't get into the details.” He stammered. He went on, and during his tirade our previous debriefer and this raving loon had come to a non-verbal agreement that the old debriefers' work here was done, as he handed over his clipboard and shambled out of the room.

“All I need from you all is to follow the tests I put in your mission outlines and take extremely detailed notes.” The professor said. He walked to the door, this time much calmer and purposeful. “Telepathy people. This is telepathy.” He said over his shoulder on his way out. I now notice that the room's tone had shifted to curious and awake. He couldn’t be serious, right? Maybe he put receivers in these poor people's brains that read their thoughts and sent them to the others. Yet somehow the way he’s talking about it makes it seem worse and more complicated than that. Telepathy? This building is for science, not magic.

All we could do as a team was share a few confused glances before our mission began. Five people, each wearing button up shirts with their allocated number, entered the room beyond the glass wall. Their new home was big enough to comfortably fit them all, full of beds, two private bathrooms in the back-end corners of the room, male and female, a dining table and chairs, and a shelf of reading material present opposite the door they came in. We were to watch these people through our one-sided window for an undisclosed amount of time. And they had “telepathy”. “Ridiculous” was the conclusion I came to.

As I’m recounting my experiences here, I’ve realized that my head is spinning, and the sweat is starting to pool at the base of my keyboard. I wish none of this was true, I wish to return home, I wish to not know what I know. It terrifies me. Anxiety is swelling up in my throat. I feel as though I’ve drunk enough to cause a night full of regret. And it's all beginning to bubble over. The room is shifting and rotating like I’m a lost sock in a broken washing machine filled with shit. My heart sinks below the floorboards of the filthy shack that I've found myself in. Even below the surface I can feel it pounding and urging me to stay alert. Eyes are on me. I’m surrounded by whispering voices that want in, but I won’t let them get to me. Bangs on the door rattle through my ear drum, piercing my skull with each thump, and I feel as though I’m going to collapse. I heave and I heave but nothing leaves me. No barf. No breath. Only desperate wheezes.

Until it stops.

I haven’t drunk a drop of liquor. My room is clean, as it should be. I’m alone, no whispers, no banging. Its ok. I’m ok.

But it feels close.

I’ll continue retelling my story tomorrow.



**03/04/25 – 1300 hours**

Entry 2

Whatever “procedure” the professor spoke of earlier had already taken place. All that was left was to test and observe.

The first few days were boring and normal. They all engaged in small talk and got to know each other. A young Korean girl, maybe in her early twenties (She was labelled number 1 on her uniform), confided with a single mother from Bangladesh, she had the most caring eyes and had a strong maternal instinct (number 2). A shorter Caucasian man, (3) was telling an equally short, older uncle from Singapore (4) about his gambling troubles (the reason he’s here). The Singaporean listened intently and tried to give advice with his hands comfortably sitting behind his back. The gambler did not listen in return, only vented. A tall African American man (5) immediately inspected the collection of reading material on the shelves. He seemed quiet and was by far the most physically fit in the group.

Their life details and anything that may be important are in our files. We were encouraged to still use their numbers, not their names. According to our records these were test subjects, not people, it’s almost barbaric. A lot of people here only saw them as such, subjects that aided in the advancement of, well, whatever the government wished to advance, I suppose. Craig was always against this. Made him furious that they “weren't even granted the basic human decency to have a name.” Even now, I can't remember their names.

*Test 1-*

It was simple. We ask them to briefly tell us how they’re feeling, what they’re thinking about, then to think of something specific.

Korean girl (1) was first-

“okay”, “home”.

“Think of sunflowers.” Craig spoke to them through a speaker.

Bangladesh woman (2)-

“tired”, “my children”, again, told to think of sunflowers.

By this point we’d forgotten the professor's speech, and the drawl of work took us over again, sifting through tests and notes as our tasks wore on.

The gambler (3)-

“bored”, “money,” sunflowers.

Singaporean uncle (4)-

“Huh? Oh! Happy"", “my new friends.” Sunflowers.

The fit dark-skinned man (5)-

“intrigued”, “your book collection.” Sunflowers.

We then went on to record their brain activity, blood pressure, etc. All baseline stuff. We repeated these tests every three hours for the first day with no noteworthy results. At 2200 hours our coworker, Dylan, a gruff man and a heavy cynic, grabbed the microphone to speak to our guests.

“Do any of you feel anything worth noting?” He grumbled past his thick beard.

“... I’m tired of thinking about sunflowers. hahaha” the Singaporean uncle chimed.

“Do the rest of you feel this way?” Dylan asked the room. His question was answered with shrugs and silence. After a sigh he asked “Hear any... voices? In your head that... aren’t your own?”

He was jumping a bit forward. These tests were specifically structured. We weren’t sure how much the patients knew of what the results of the procedure were, but I knew he was not supposed to ask that. I suppose it didn’t matter as his question was once again greeted by a confused silence. “Typical.” Dylan huffed, off mic, to only himself, I suppose. He walked away and promptly clocked off for the night. Dylan would be in deep shit once this got out, the higher ups are very particular. He was prone to frustrated out bursts at tests he thought were a waste of time.

“What do you mean “voices”?” The tall number 5 asked. We had no answer to give to our neighbors on the other side of the window, so we gave no answer. Anything outside of taking notes and tests was above our pay grade anyway, so we all began packing up and clocking out too.

Gabriella, Craig, and I were the last to leave. Gabriella was shy and thorough with her notes, so she stayed a while to revise and observe at her station. She was deep in her files like a cave diver dislocating themselves just to enter a virgin passage, a hair tie holding back her deep brunette hair from hindering her work. She only halted every now and then to push up her thick framed glasses. I was tired and made myself another coffee on my way out, Craig joined me, though we didn’t speak, so I passed silent glances between Gabriella, the test subjects, and my feet, as if they were playing some invisible three-way tennis match. We, the lucky few, witnessed their first signs. “Stupid sunflowers.” The Korean girl, the gambler, and the Singaporean uncle moaned in unison. They looked at each other confused, as did we. They began a debate on coincidence or not. An hour of overtime note taking and observing, and the rest of us window watchers were able to head home.

This was the first time they did that, spoke in unison I mean, lord knows it's not the last.

I can still hear their synchronized groans.

I need a drink before I think about this anymore. My heart rate is through the roof. Maybe writing this was a bad idea.

Entry 3

I forgot to write today (yesterday?). Forgetting feels nice. Easily achievable with the appropriate amount of pain killers and alcohol. I’ve made sure to stock my temporary motel room with said supplies and spent the day partaking in them. It doesn’t help the dizziness, but I finally feel mental quiet and physical numbness.

I don’t know why I’m even hiding. Why I’m jumping from motel to motel. It could find me if it wants. I’m sure if anyone else from my old job was looking for me, they’d find me too.

It just feels right. To run. It's all I can do.

I’m sorry, Craig, if you're out there. I didn’t mean for this to happen. Any of it.

That last look you gave me will haunt me the most.



**03/06/25 – 1840 hours**

Entry 4

Day two of the experiment wasn’t noteworthy, except for the fact that Dylan didn’t come in. In fact, he never came in again. Who knows if he got fired or if another terrible fate befell him. We went on as usual, though. Test, watch as their food is delivered and eaten, test, watch, test. More baselines, asking them how they’re feeling, etc., etc.

In-between tests I tried to make small talk mixed with half assed attempts at humor with Craig and the rest of the crew. “Lovely day for it, huh?” knowing we’d be inside our windowless box all day, the weather not affecting us in the slightest. I don’t think they heard me, because they didn’t laugh. Gabriella buried herself in her work, the woman I don't know the name of would give one-word answers out of politeness but clearly did not want to be spoken to (I did learn her name was Alexa though). And Craig, well, the usual, barely receiving eye contact let alone a conversation. His eyes were sunken and soulless, and he’d lost the extra weight he had around him and then some. He’s still torn up inside over what happened. Does he know it eats away at me too? Or does he sense me as the catalyst? I don’t know what led us to continue to work here, but here we are, the invisible hand of fate guiding us along.

I stewed in my own anguish for most of that day. Silent crew, lack luster results, Craig, all of it was dragging me down. At the time I remember wanting nothing more than a drink, but my 2-month company mandated sobriety streak loomed over me, so a coffee would have to suffice.

The professor snapped me out of my mental crisis with yet another unannounced intrusion.

“After receiving your reports yesterday, I updated your work outline. I’m aware that there are cameras that are monitored, and the recordings are checked, however, I have brought up the possibility of 24-hour personnel monitoring with the higher ups, and they seem to agree.” This alone would’ve brought my blood pressure up another notch, resulting in a very good reason to break my sobriety. If it weren’t for his next sentence, that worsened things still. “So, if anything... happens, we have eyewitnesses. They called me mad, but I already know this will be a great success.” This man and his cryptic nonsense were going to send me over the edge today.

“Are you going to explain a single thing to us? How can we do our job without the facts? Now we’re supposed to monitor them 24/7?” I hissed through clenched teeth, stress weighing on me.

“We don’t know the details of what happened to these people or what will happen. Do they even know?” Craig announced, stepping forward. Craig was a selfless, soft man. He wasn’t even surprised about the extra hours, he just wants to help these people. Looking at him, I noticed that he’d turned pale.

“We’re getting paid overtime for this right?” Alexa added.

“Yes, yes. Please trust me, we will get to all that soon. In the meantime, ... Do your fucking jobs.” The Professors smiley answer turned to a spit and a snarl. On his way out, he mentioned one last thing over his shoulder. “You will be paid double for this of course.”

We apparently need the money just as much as the people beyond the glass because at the end of the day we’re all still here. Exiting our observation room, at the end of the hall, past the locked door of the test subjects, is our new home, fitted with beds, a kitchen, a bathroom and of course a full camera monitoring set up so we can continue our work, day in, day out. We were only allowed in this room outside of regular working hours. Anyone not agreeing to these terms and who wants to go home was instructed to do so but not to return.



**03/07/25 - 1250 hours**

Entry 5

There was a knock at my door last night, at least I think there was. Of course I didn’t answer, I didn’t even have the courage to get out of bed. It came during my extensive nightly attempt to sleep after my last entry. Just three quick taps of my motel door, a fair few feet away from me and instantly my breath was caught in my chest, I was unable to move a muscle. Like stone, like I wasn’t even alive, I lay there unmoving, waiting. Waiting for what, I don’t know, but the lord knows I waited. Waiting while the room is filled with nothing but the ticking clock above my head, heart lurching with every tick. And dread. The room was filled with dread, up to the brim. My ears catching every sound, I swear I could hear my own blood pump and yet I couldn’t tell if my heart was as still as I was or if it was fluttering and fleeing the confines of my ribcage. It must have been hours before I almost had the courage to shuffle an inch again. Alas, before my freedom was granted, another knock came. Another quick three taps. How could this be? The exact same knock, hours apart. I was surely hearing things again, I must be. But this felt so real, and my delusions come in quick intense spats, not this prolonging torture.

Was it there? On the other side of the door. Waiting as I too am waiting. Still, as I too am still! Barely breathing as I too am barely breathing! I must be going mad. I can’t take this anymore, I thought. Now I knew for certain that my heart was racing, pumping, pounding! I was about to get up. Dear god I was actually about to go face this thing. Launch from my bed and lunge at the door, a desperate attack, an attempt better than nothing. Better than laying here for eternity. A clashing of symbols, an impact of a waterfall, a climax of an explosion, a RUSH. Fighting the bed sheets that engulfed me, I escaped my own mental restraints and sprinted for the door. Before even a blink could arrive, I did. Right at the door. Fate on the other side.

Of course it was empty. Of course nothing was there. I stood with the door swung open and nothing but cool air brushing against me like a mother caressing and calming a child. As I began to close the door, as it slid past my face and almost shut, I saw it.

A letter sat at my feet.



**03/08/25 - 1652 hours**

Entry 6

By now it was August 28th, and we had adjusted to our living standards quickly. Alexa and Gabriella got along well, sharing notes, theories, and even started talking about their personal lives. Gabriella wanted to start her own lab and studies. Me and Craig even began to talk. Small talk and work talk but still talk.

I pushed open the door to our main observation room that morning, balancing a paper cup filled with coffee. Craig was already there, leaning against the counter, staring through the glass.

“Morning,”.

Craig snorted. “Barely. You look like you lost a fight with your alarm clock.”

“I did,” I replied. “It won by a landslide.”

“Good to see you’re still getting your sleep”

I scoffed. “I wouldn’t say that”

“Struggling huh?” He took a sip from his own coffee. “Yeah, me too. If they’re going to force us to sleep here, they could at least give us some half decent mattresses.”

We shared a chuckle, even though we both knew the mattresses weren’t the issue. Then we went to work. We had a routine and things were nice. The subjects reported nothing more than difficulty sleeping, increased appetite and a small amount of anxiety, all of which could be attributed to their environment, so we brought in some requested items for each of them. The Bangladesh woman requested a photo of her family, the Singaporean uncle requested a potted plant, the gambler wanted his marriage ring (he was divorced), the African American man wanted a book from home, and the Korean girl shyly requested her bear plushy, said it helped her sleep.

It was going smoothly. Those were the best days of the experiment. The last good day of our lives.

“What’d you say?” The gambler said as he got up from his bed. Confused glances spread throughout their room as we, the watchers, leaned forward at our workstations.  “Don’t act dumb! What did you say? I “stink”?!” He said something along those lines. This time he received a series of “Huh's” and “what’s”, confusion and tension growing. His gaze was locked onto the Korean girl sitting on the floor with her bear plushy. Her innocence radiated from her, yet the gambler was in denial. He approached her and swiftly yanked her bear away from her.

“I didn’t say shit, you freak!” She screamed in retaliation. “You do stink though.” she grumbled under her breath. This girl was usually quiet, for such a sudden outburst the plushy must’ve meant a lot to her. She couldn’t have been younger than 19 yet she clung to it like a child. By this escalation, the rest of the room began defending the girl.

“What? No, I’m not crazy... I-” he said with shaky breaths as he held his head with one hand and the bear with the other. “No. No! I know what this is. This isn’t how it was meant to be. He said it was like a walkie-talkie! We can just turn it off. Why are you able to hear what I think without my consent! Why can I hear you all! Judging me!” he shouted, fear in his voice, holding the bear high.

*Test 2-*

Craig once again had control of the microphone as he instructed the room to calm down and return the girl's belongings to her. They were told to sit on their respective beds and listen.

“Number one, I need you to focus. Please tell us what you're thinking,” Craig asked.

“I want to go home. Are you sure I’ll be safe in here?” The girl said. Her rage had subsided and was replaced with a growing fear.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking"" Craig visibly gulped down his empathy as he forced himself to ignore the girl's question and follow the script in our work outline.

“No, I have no idea what they’re thinking.” She responded.

“Number two, what are you thinking about?” Craig continued.

“I think Number three should be removed from this experiment after that outburst.” The Bangladesh woman confessed, her motherly instincts most likely wanted to take care of our youngest guest.

“Please look at the rest of your roommates and decide if you can understand what they are thinking,"" Craig repeated. After some deep thought, she had an answer for this seemingly silly question.

“I think... someone is thinking of sunflowers again.”

“Number three-” Craig began.

“This is bullshit” The gambler cut off the voice echoing out of the speaker. “And I think someone wants their bear back” he continued. Odd, since the girl already had her bear plushy returned to her.

“Number four.”

“Well, uh, I must admit I was thinking of sunflowers.” The old Singaporean sat, staring at the Bangladesh woman who stared back. “I think she’s thinking of her children.”

“Number five.”

“I... want my bear back...” The tall intimidating African American man sat so smally as he said this, staring at his hands and hunched over.

“That is all for now.” one last note from Craig before he turned off the microphone and leaned back in his chair, brushing his hair back with a long exhale. The people inside the room split off into their usual groups and quietly discussed the results of this test. Number five sat on his own and read.

""Kaya ko ba 'to? Baka sobrang tapang and hindi pala ok. Sobrang risky but I've been seeing it on the menu for years and maybe this time, it's worth the try ulit.""

The first sip was so strong. It's like being high in sugar na you just want to consume forever and hope it never runs out. I was a complete person myself, but it made me feel complete-r. Diba OA? Haha.

The second sip was stronger. I was already making plans in my head. Maybe a bigger cup would be better next time. Maybe I can add another shot and maybe whipped cream on top, for sure magiging ok pa lalo.

I stared at my half-consumed cup. Hindi ko narealize na I was already halfway. I didn't listen to the barista saying na to ""take it slow"" when it was handed over to me. Sure, in the back of my head, I was already foreseeing some bad effects. I knew the caffeine withdrawal is going to be messy af. But I ignored it knowing this isn't the first time anyway. I can always go back tomorrow and order another.

I got to the last few sips not knowing they were the last. The ice cubes hit my skin. Sobrang lamig pero sige lang, it's just ice.

I asked the barista if I can get a refill in the same cup. Sabi ko pa nga na I'm willing to pay naman.

""Last order na yan, ma'am. We're closing na. It's 10pm."" He said in a very stern voice like as if he's just waiting for me to leave so they can close.

Na-off guard ako kasi he was friendly and chatty pa naman kanina. But then I thought he got to sell another cup.. so I guess his job is done. He's just doing what he intended to do. ""Ay sorry, akala ko kasi open kayo til midnight."", I responded then left.

That night, I almost pleaded but hindi na nga pala ako yun. Ang babaw pero I know this time I gotta give myself some self-respect. The right barista will not make you feel confused or give you doubts. They will always make time and not make you feel like you're an inconvenience. You wouldn't need to apologize and shedding a bit of vulnerability would be like waiting for you to decide on what croissant you'd want with your coffee and they would still take your order with a genuine smile. It's basic human decency.

The coffee was great but the service was not. Marami pang coffee shops around and I know they'd be willing to take orders anytime, baka with free 2 croissants pa nga and not just one.

I honestly wish I never did any of this but I'm kind of glad that I finally got the closure na I've always wanted. I can be upset, tell them very mean things, scream at them, but I won't.

The world needs more kindness than anger and they probably need it more than I do.

To you: I hope we both heal, grow, and find the things that will truly make us happy. I mean this in the kindest way possible I know how but if you ever get to see this, please don't ever reach out to me again. Don't even bother composing a reply because it was never an option for you when I asked for one.

You did the same thing to me once and you did it again.. but worse this time around.

Despite all this, I'm not going to blame you for not showing up because I will always understand why but then again, whatever song you decide to play next, I wish it's a rhythm that will always remind you of why you chose to say ""habambuhay"" when it's not.",1,1763122580.0,u_matchamilktea_,0,1.0,False

1owuw5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/1owuw5g/how_to_be_a_good_flatmate_in_uni/,How to be a good flatmate in uni,"Hi, so I'm 26, a bit older now and more mature, and I see a lot of posts about people struggling with first-year politics with their flatmates. Almost every time I come on here, I see patterns I used to fall into when I was a student, but I’ve since learned better ways of dealing with things. I hope to pass on some of the knowledge I’ve gained from living in professional flatshares and staying in many Airbnbs while I was between work after doing 4 years at uni. My Airbnb rating is 100% 5\* lol and I always get on with anyone I live with - but in first year at uni I was the shy loner who wouldn’t come out of his room. I would avoid the kitchen, feel like people didn’t “get” me, built up quiet resentment, and never really knew how to connect or build relationships. Being the first person in my family to go to uni, I lacked any guidance, and my parents weren’t exactly supportive (they were more annoyed that I was moving away than proud).

The main thing I’ve learned over the years is people skills - understanding how to work with different personalities. When you’re young and have just left home, you’re often subconsciously looking for the family environment you once had, so your judgement is shaped by trying to find that north star again. Some people get lucky and find it quickly; others don’t, and they end up feeling confused, left out, or worse, like they are the problem.

The biggest skill to learn to beat all of this, in my view, is reciprocity. You have to give things to people for them to give things back to you. I don’t mean being overly generous or spoiling people with gifts, it’s about doing things that are genuinely and obviously helpful without expecting anything in return. It’s compassion, care, empathy, and trusting that people will return these things in their own way.

You do small favours for your flatmates: buy milk one day, make them a cup of tea without being asked, pick up flowers or decorations for the shared kitchen, remember their birthdays and leave a note, take the bins out and clean up - not because it’s “your turn” but because you want the space to feel better. The beautiful thing about reciprocity is that it almost always comes back in unexpected and amazing ways. It becomes a kind of feedback loop: you start by buying each other milk, and a month later you’re getting creative and surprising each other with little thoughtful things, like a funny coffee mug.

I once bought my friend a gingerbread man from Co-op for 85p -- it even smashed in my bag on the way home and I gave her it broken into 6 pieces -- and yet she appreciated it so much she got me a tiny Jellycat cherry plush and one of those “paint your own mug” kits. We ended up having a really cool evening making them together, and I still have the mug and plushy to this day.

I promise you, the best relationships start by recognising how to plant those small seeds of reciprocity. It can even begin with genuine compliments -- giving someone confidence, validating their thoughts, praising how hard they’re studying, or openly appreciating their fashion. Not flattery - just genuinely giving out good energy.

And you can do it the other way around too: ask people for small favours. A great one is knocking on their door and asking if they have any spare paper for you to use. It gets people to plant seeds of reciprocity in you, and it opens up the relationship so both of you feel comfortable asking and giving. Life is already pretty hard, nobody wants it to get harder because they ran out of shampoo or forgot an ingredient for dinner.

Flatmates and the people you live with can become amazing long-term relationships that genuinely enrich your life. :)",1,1763122472.0,UniUK,0,1.0,False

I made the first stop with two decants of ME perfumes, and a lone designer one. Since then, I’ve only been trying out more ME, and only recently have I decided to explore more of the designer world. So here’s my amateurish take (lacking finer details) on four decants, including one ME:
1. CH Good Girl: I’ve been wanting to try this one out since forever and it lives up to its hype. It was love at first spritz. It smells smooth, sensual, feminine, and sophisticated. To my nose, it’s more of a floral symphony wrapped in a subtle vanilla note, with the coffee note completely undetectable. It’s long lasting on my skin and even more so on clothes. This one is my favourite so far.

2. Versace Bright Crystal: My first choice was Crystal Noir but since it was out of stock, I decided to settle for this. It has a fruity floral fresh scent which strangely feels nostalgic but for the life of me, I can’t remember where I’ve smelt it before. It has a screechy/sharp note to it which I can’t pinpoint.This one didn’t hit that sweet spot for me, I like it but don’t love it. Longevity is moderate.

3. Versace Eros Flame: I got this for my hubby. It has a strong citrusy spicy opening with a refined cozy undercurrent, and this one might just be my favourite of all the perfumes he’s worn so far; he’s only ever worn ME before. Longevity is moderate.

4. Rasasi Hawas OG: This smells fresh and fruity, a dna which I feel my hubby greatly enjoys. In my opinion, it’s warm weather-appropriate. Longevity is excellent.

I’ve Burberry Goddess, Prada Paradoxe, and Versace Crystal Noir currently on my wishlist. As for my hubby, I’m zeroing in on Azzaro The Most Wanted Intense. Recommendations are welcome. Thank you.

1owurjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1owurjs/the_undoing/,The Undoing,"Harold Pender had always risen before the sun, but that October morning he woke to a house holding its breath. The walls, old pine boards he and Agnes had sanded by hand five decades ago, seemed to listen as he swung his legs out of bed. The air carried the faintest scent of turned Earth, though the windows were shut tight.

Agnes was already in the kitchen, bent over a pot of coffee as if warming her hands on the steam might steady her. She glanced up when he entered, her smile polite but thin, the way it had been for weeks now. Neither of them mentioned the sound they both heard in the night, the soft patter on the floorboards, like bare feet too small to be Harold’s and far too quick.

Instead, Harold cleared his throat. “You smell the dirt?” he asked. Agnes didn’t look up. “Yes.” Outside, the fields waited. The pumpkins were rich and full this year, knotted vines stretching across the rows like veins. They had never grown this fast, three days ago the field had looked tired, ready to rest for winter. Now the pumpkins bulged against their own skins, swollen.

Harold walked the northern edge of the patch, boots sinking deeper than they should have in the soil. A crow sat on the fence post, its wings wet with morning dew. It stared at him, silent, throat trembling as if trying, and failing, to call out.

Agnes joined him a few minutes later, her cardigan pulled tight around her. She looked toward the far end of the field, where their grandson liked to spend his mornings digging “little treasure holes” with a rusted hand trowel. He wasn’t out yet. That was unusual. “Maybe he’s sleeping in,” Harold offered, though he knew better. The boy hadn’t slept past dawn since he arrived two months ago. Neither had they, not truly.

Agnes shifted her weight, uneasy. “The East fence is down,” she said. “Again.” Harold followed her gaze. The fence, newly repaired last week after the posts were found split now lay in the grass, not broken this time but pulled up cleanly from the Earth. The soil around the holes was smooth, untouched, as if the posts had slid out on their own.

Agnes reached for Harold’s arm. “We need to ask him about it,” she whispered. A sudden chill swept across the field. The crow finally opened its beak, not to caw, but to cough, harsh and wet, as though something inside its throat resisted being expelled. Harold took a step back from the fence. “We will,” he murmured. “But not yet. Let’s… watch a little longer.”

From somewhere behind them, up by the house, the floorboards creaked. Slow. Careful. Like someone small was trying to move without making a sound. Harold did not turn toward the house right away. He stood rooted in the soft soil, listening. The creak came again, one long, drawn-out note that traveled through the beams of the old farmhouse like a breath sliding through ribs. Agnes gripped his sleeve. “He’s awake,” she said, though her voice betrayed no comfort in the thought.

They walked back together, neither willing to lead. The porch steps groaned beneath their weight, but when Harold opened the screen door, the house inside was still. The hallway stretched ahead, washed in dim orange light that filtered through the curtains. The kitchen smelled faintly of coffee and… something else. Sweet, but not pleasant. Like fruit left too long in a sealed box.

Agnes called gently, “Jacob? Honey?” A small shadow moved in the living room, quick, low to the ground. Harold stepped forward, heart thudding. But it was only the old cat, Clover, her fur puffed and eyes wide. She slunk past Harold, tail rigid, and fled through the open kitchen window as if escaping a fire. Harold watched the curtains settle behind her escape. “Strange,” he muttered. Agnes didn’t reply. Her gaze had drifted toward the stairs.

“Jacob?” she tried again. There came an answer, a soft scrape, like wood on wood. Then the sound of something rolling across the upstairs floorboards, round and heavy. It thudded once, then stopped. Harold swallowed. “Maybe he’s playing with his toys.” “He doesn’t have anything that rolls,” Agnes whispered.

That was true. He never asked for any toys either. He seemed content digging in the soil, tracing his small fingers along pumpkin vines, humming tunelessly to himself in a voice too low. Harold started up the stairs. Agnes followed close behind, clutching the railing. Halfway up, Harold paused. The air felt thicker here, warmer, as if a summer draft lingered only on the staircase. The scent from the kitchen, overripe fruit, was stronger.

They reached the landing. The hallway carpet was damp, though no window was open. Damp and darkened in a trail that led toward Jacob’s room. Harold touched the carpet with his fingertips, then pulled back sharply. Not water. Something more like sap, sticky, with a faint orange tint that clung to his skin. Agnes covered her mouth.

“Harold,” she breathed. “It’s pumpkin. It’s pumpkin flesh.” Before he could respond, Jacob’s door creaked, slowly swinging open. Inside, the boy sat cross-legged in the center of the room. His back was to them. His small hand moved in slow circles on the floor, as though comforting something. Whispering to it.

Agnes stepped forward. “Jacob,” she said softly, “what are you-” Jacob turned his head halfway, not fully, just enough for one eye to peer at them from the corner of his face. His hand slid away from whatever he’d been touching. Something rolled toward them across the floor with a soft, wet sound. It bumped lightly against Harold’s boot. A small pumpkin. Split open. Seeds spilled out like teeth.

Jacob smiled, only slightly, barely noticeable. But Harold felt the shift of it, like a cold fingertip tracing the back of his neck. “Look what grew,” the boy whispered.",2,1763122090.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

You don’t need spreadsheets, consultants, or a magnifying glass, just a bit of awareness and honesty.

For me, the red flags show up fast:

A franchisor who dodges simple financial questions 🤔

Franchisees who sound exhausted instead of excited

“Systems” that are basically vibes and verbal promises

Reps who pressure you more than they guide you

Or my personal favorite: “We’re still figuring that part out.” 🚩😂

At this point, I feel like I can sense a shaky franchise before the coffee even kicks in.

But I’m curious…

👉 What are the early warning signs YOU look for when evaluating a franchise or business opportunity?

👉 Have you ever walked out of a call or meeting thinking, “Nope, this isn’t it”?

I’m 26 years old. I’ve been unemployed for a year now. I’m from the IT area (Cybersecurity). Even though I don’t have a degree, I completed a technical course and hold some certifications in the field.

My life completely changed in less than six months. I lost my job and broke up with my ex. She was Chinese and studied here in Portugal. We were together for a year and a half in Portugal until she had to return to China. We kept a long-distance relationship; I went to China twice to see her, and she came here once during that period while we were dating long-distance. I always believed in that relationship, I even got a job offer in China, but since I didn’t have a degree, I couldn’t go.

Things started going badly at work, and the consulting company I was with gave me an ultimatum: either go every day to the company’s headquarters and be pulled off client work, or sign the resignation letter and leave. At the time, I had a retention clause of 12k for three years. As soon as it expired, they found a way to get rid of me.

I met my ex because I was learning Mandarin and she was here learning Portuguese. That’s when I started getting more and more interested in the history of the Portuguese in Asia. The Portuguese left behind an enormous cultural and historical legacy in dozens of Asian countries such as: Japan, Korea, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Macau, and others.

I can spend hours and hours reading papers, books, and articles on the topic. It truly fascinates me. Besides Mandarin, I also learned another Asian language that’s mutually intelligible with another one they’re almost two languages in one, just with a different accent and some different words.

For several years now, I’ve had this dream of getting a degree in History and continuing all the way to a PhD. My biggest life dream is to become a researcher on Portuguese expansion in Asia. The fact that I speak two Asian languages could help with that. I’m also thinking of starting to learn Japanese, and later on I want to focus on Cantonese because it could be useful if I move to Macau one day. Living in Macau is another dream when I was there, it was honestly one of the happiest moments of my life. I hadn’t felt that happy in over ten years, like I did during those two weeks in Hong Kong and Macau.

Since leaving my job, it’s been really hard to get back into the field. I’ve had more than 80 interviews in IT alone. There were days when I had three interviews in a single day and still nothing. In the meantime, I had two part-time jobs during the summer, not related to IT, where I managed to save some money, but not much. I’m a very frugal person no bad habits, I don’t drink, don’t smoke, don’t buy expensive clothes, so since I started working until now I’ve managed to save about 40k. That’s my safety net, save 40k in Portugal is 10 times harder than the US

I still live with my parents and used to help with household expenses, but now, unemployed, I can’t.

I don’t feel happy where I live not even in Portugal. I live in one of the most beautiful towns in the country, but prices here are absurd and opportunities are almost non-existent.

Without a car, you can’t do anything; we call it “doing the rounds” because people just walk from one place to another since there’s nothing to do for young people. Apart from the local pool, there are only two or three cafés everything else is restaurants. Gossip is still a big thing here everyone talks about everyone. It’s a small place where everyone knows each other. If you want to grow, you have to leave, even if it’s to Lisbon.

This year, I got into a History degree, and I’ve been enjoying the experience, but I feel there’s still a long road ahead before I can reach where I want to be and an even greater uncertainty that I’ll ever achieve my dreams. Time keeps passing;

By the time I finish the degree I’ll be 30, and the master’s will take another two years. I’d finish my studies at 32, which compared to many others feels late there are people at 25 or 26 already doing PhDs, and at 22 or 23 finishing their master’s.

Because of a series of mistakes honestly, stupid decisions on my part for exemple: I never finished my degree,I started Computer Engineering degree but dropped out because of Mathematics. Right now, doing an engineering degree is out of the question. Even finishing the math in my technical course was tough, and I’m also terrible at programming. I’m the kind of person who can only focus on what I truly enjoy everything else just doesn’t stick.

Being unemployed is destroying me. I feel like a loser. I wake up feeling like I’m in a nightmare like a horror movie. I’m not earning money, I’m not contributing, and whenever I go to interviews, they ask, “What have you been doing this past year?” I tell them I’ve been going to interviews, searching for a job and they just stare at me like I’m lazy or unwilling to work.

Even for basic, unskilled jobs, I’m not getting in. I’ve sent my CV to supermarkets, pet shops, cleaning companies, nothing...

As for everything else, I have nothing keeping me here no debts, no car loan, no mortgage, nothing.

I’ve also been seeing my friends less and less. We have very different interests now. Over the last two years I’ve really noticed it. What they like : cars, games, etc... It doesn’t interest me. I’m into history, languages, and that sort of thing. They couldn’t care less.

We used to play games together, but I stop playing games when I was 18. My PC can’t even handle modern games anymore. Everyone’s living their own lives, and I wish them the best, but it’s not something that keeps me here..

My parents are nearing 70, and that worries me if I have to leave Portugal. But deep down, I feel my dream is abroad. I truly believe Portugal doesn’t value people who work hard.

Housing prices are insane compared to our salaries. It’s not that life abroad is perfect, but it’s different. From the bottom of my heart, I feel I need to go abroad preferably to Asia. That’s where I feel happy.

My plan is to finish my History degree and keep studying languages. I’m currently at HSK 4 in Mandarin. Within five years, by the time I finish my master’s, I could easily reach HSK 5 or even HSK 6. For Japanese, I’d like to reach at least N3, ideally N2. I’d also like to learn Cantonese, mainly because of Macau, I feel that if I reach a good language level in the countries where I want to go, it could open many doors for me.

I feel that if I stay in Portugal, I’ll live a miserable life, always counting the money not to mention the worsening security situation. When I was in Hong Kong, Macau, China, and Singapore, I noticed an enormous difference in safety compared to Portugal.

On the other hand, I don’t want to give up on IT. My ex-boss told me I wasn’t focused, that I had personal problems, that to work in cybersecurity you need to be 100% focused, and so on.

I’d really like to return to IT, even if it’s in a Helpdesk role. I still have a lot to learn and would like to earn more certifications in the field.

But even if I don’t work in IT, any job would do even in a store, an electronics shop, a supermarket, whatever. I just don’t want to be unemployed anymore.

I feel I’m becoming extremely depressed. There are weeks when I don’t leave the house for three or four days. My relationship with my friends feels increasingly distant, with fewer shared interests. I still have one friend I sometimes go out with for coffee or a walk, but we also disagree on many things.

1owufbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonNewThings/comments/1owufbh/when_should_i_replace_my_old_coat_rack/,When should I replace my old coat rack?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been staring at my beat-up coat rack for months now, and I finally decided to figure out when it's actually time to replace one of these things. Thought I'd share what I learned because honestly, most of us probably keep our coat racks way longer than we should.

**The Obvious Signs**

First off, if your coat rack is wobbling like it's had too much coffee, that's a red flag. Mine started tipping over every time I hung my winter jacket on it. Not cool when you're rushing out the door and suddenly there's a pile of coats on the floor.

Rust is another big one, especially if you have a metal coat rack near your entryway where it gets exposed to wet umbrellas and damp winter gear. Once rust starts spreading, it's pretty much game over. It'll stain your clothes and just looks nasty.

**When It Stops Doing Its Job**

Here's the thing – a coat rack has literally one job. If the hooks are breaking off, the base is cracked, or it can't hold your family's coats without collapsing, it's time to move on. I kept telling myself I'd ""fix it later"" but let's be real, that never happens.

The weight capacity matters too. If you've got heavy winter parkas, leather jackets, or multiple people using the same rack, you need something sturdy. Your old one might've worked fine ten years ago, but maybe your needs have changed.

**Style and Space Issues**

Sometimes it's not about damage – maybe your coat rack just doesn't fit your space anymore. I moved to a smaller apartment last year, and my old floor-standing rack took up way too much room. Wall-mounted options or more compact designs can make a huge difference in tight spaces.

And yeah, sometimes things just look dated. If your entryway looks like it's stuck in 2005, a new coat rack can actually refresh the whole area without breaking the bank.

**What I Did**

I finally pulled the trigger and started looking at replacements. Found some solid options through [this collection](https://athomewave.com/coat-rack) that took me straight to Amazon where I could compare prices and read actual reviews from people. 

The variety surprised me – there are standing racks, wall hooks, tree-style ones, and even benches with coat storage built in. I ended up going with a simple but sturdy metal one that holds way more weight than my old wooden rack ever could.

**Bottom Line**

Replace your coat rack when it's not safe, not functional, or not fitting your needs anymore. Don't wait until it actually breaks and dumps all your stuff on the floor (learned that lesson the hard way).

If you're in the market for a new one, [check out what's available here](https://athomewave.com/coat-rack) and see what works for your space and budget. Sometimes the simplest upgrades make the biggest difference in your daily routine.

My LO is 17 months old and has always been very active, but ever since he learned to walk he’s basically unstoppable. 
All he wants to do is walk/run everywhere, and it’s making even the simplest tasks basically impossible : grocery shopping, errands, anything that requires even 2 seconds of my attention. In stores he wants to run everywhere and if I try to put him in the cart, hold him, or stop him from going somewhere it instantly becomes a meltdown.
What hurts is that he’s not like this with his dad.

Today we met a mom friend for coffee at a mall, and after we walked into a shop he grabbed a toy. I made him put it down and that was it, full meltdown. One of the biggest he’s had in a while. I couldn’t calm him down. 

We went to the parking lot, then I tried breastfeeding him in the car hoping it would help, but nothing worked. He was shaking, screaming, completely inconsolable. I ended up driving home with him screaming the entire 20-minute ride, covered in tears and snot.

I honestly feel like I’m inches away from having an emotional meltdown myself. 
I don’t know how to parent through this. You can’t reason with a toddler this age, but I feel powerless and lost.

And to make it worse, my husband keeps implying that it’s my fault that my son behaves better and is more “collected” when I’m not around. And that just makes me feel even more defeated.

I don’t know what to do. Is this normal? How do I handle these meltdowns? How do I teach him anything when he gets like this?

President Trump is readying some substantial tariff cuts in a bid to address **voter ( weird he says VOTER concerns )** concerns over the rising cost of goods. Trump is hoping to ease high prices on coffee, bananas and other foods. The tariff cuts will come with a series of new trade deals, which will include framework agreements with Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador.

In addition, Trump has previewed broader tariff exemptions that could cut levies on popular food products across the board.

""Coffee, we're going to lower some tariffs,"" Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in an interview.

1owu1bu,https://i.redd.it/9yaa9z3rj71g1.gif,Chuck Pride of the Worm-Father! (Sora-1 + Grok),"Yeah I know right? Once you realise what they are — just harmless little “grubs” that will later become mealworms — the whole “gross factor” evaporates. Suddenly they’re not ugly vermin anymore but these weirdly cute little buggers, in their own way.

They’re omnivores, they’ll try almost anything organic… but be careful with both store-bought and foraged plants: pesticides, herbicides, roadside pollution — all that nasty stuff accumulates fast in their tiny bodies. If you ever use them as feeder animals, always sanitise or scrub any foraged materials.

**What they DON’T like / things to avoid:**

– citrus (orange, lemon, etc.)  
– anything mouldy  
– toxic plants (rhubarb leaves, tomato leaves, nightshade family, avocado, etc.)  
– plain water — never give standing water! They drown instantly.

For hydration, give them water-rich foods:

apple slice, potato slice, cucumber, carrot, lettuce leaf, dandelion leaf…  
For larger worms, even popcorn soaked in water works well.  
A damp cotton ball or a natural sponge also works — just moist, not dripping.

Diet-wise, everyone uses oat-meal as the standard, but honestly any dry plant-based meal or powder works. I’ve fed them spent coffee grounds, blended grains, crushed dry foods — if it’s dry, you can toss it in their container and they’ll be fine.

They’re surprisingly “useful” too:

Give them a dried fish and they’ll pick it clean down to perfect, collectible bones — ready to frame if you want.

And if you ever run out of sandpaper, throw them a small piece of wood: they will literally polish it smooth. It takes time — haha — but they’ll get there eventually. Little biological sanders.

If you want to know how many you actually have (or take a “group photo” 😂):

Let them go without a water source for a day, then drop in a big slice of potato — they will swarm it. That’s also the easiest way to gather them all if you want to move them to a larger container or clean the bin when your floor isn’t a sieve-bottom. They’ll pile up neatly on that potato slice like they’re posing for a family photo.

**By the way:** this nice creation of you as worm-dad taking a picture of your worm-kids (first generation), would you mind if I used this in a future book (or animation) I’m planning to publish?

I’ve been watching quite a few episodes on YouTube, and to this day the show is absolutely timeless. Costas had a great connection with a lot of his guests, and was able to go head to head with them in unique conversation.

When I first started, it was pretty hard to get it dialed in (and it kinda still is, but I now know what to look for, because the grinder is really temperature sensitive. Just an example, when the first grind results in 25s 40g out, the third one in row will be 25s 60g out for example.). That made me pretty frustrated in the beginning, because I thought I'm doing something wrong. It was extremely hard to find out how to get the right amount out, because in videos for other machines it was all super consistent and my results were all over the place. 

During that phase I also stumbled over brew temperature, but I got the advice to not care about it, because it's just another variable I'm adding to the problem and it makes things even harder, also grind size etc. is way more important. So I kinda checked that point in my mind and never looked at it again. 

But yesterday I watched a video about syphons and their temperature (James Hoffmann) and I remembered my own temperature setting, so I checked which temperature I should be brewing at. I currently have dark roast beans and James said the range for dark roast is 85°C-90°C. But my Oracle came with 93°C set by the factory. So I made a huge jump to be able to really taste what the differences are with different temperatures, so I set it to 88°C and BOY does it taste better. Why on earth didn't I try this before. My coffee went from ""Coffee: Bitter"" to ""Chocolate heaven"". How is this even possible with a 5°C difference. 

At fancy coffee shops I was always surprised how they can make coffee, that has so many nice favour notes and I thought they have just some super nice beans, but I never thought that my coffee has them also, but I'm just doing it wrong.",12,1763119533.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

We needed to get the fuck out. But with Ben dead, and Elvis broken, it was easier said than done. Wes was frantically gathering up what medicine and weapons we had left, packing half into the car.

“I don’t understand why we don’t all just go now. Together” I barked, trailing behind him, hissing from the movement of my injured arm as I stumbled down the porch steps.

He dropped a rifle onto the backseat of his Honda, taking a breath before turning to me, the grave note in his eyes poking at me. “Aage, you don’t understand. These people, they don’t exist to help you. They’re sole purpose is to keep shit like this a secret.” His brows dipped, his hands flexing in a gesture brought on by helplessness. “They’ll kill you, they’ll kill Luna, they’ll kill Riley. They’ll kill all of us if they think it’ll keep the story from getting out. People like Elvis and me get a pass because we’re informants for them. We watch for what their churches can’t see. But that privilege won’t be given to you. They cannot know you were ever here.” He placed a hand on my shoulder. “Aage, if there was any other way, I’d stay as far as I possibly could get from the Inquisition. But there isn’t. They’re the only people powerful enough to keep that bastard from following us while we escape.”

A frustrated breath huffed through my teeth. “I just don’t like the idea of sitting here on my hands waiting for you to come back.”

Wes managed to convince his lips to tilt into a slight smile as he took his hat off. “You’ll do fine, kid” he said, tapping me on the chest. “It doesn’t feel like it, but this is the safest place for you. The only place he can’t set foot. You just need to keep your head on straight and be careful. He’ll try anything to trick you into letting your guard down. Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening. It’ll only be a few hours. Elvis and I will meet with the inquisitors, then we’ll come straight back here to get you. Then we’ll drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

My jaw was set as I processed everything, giving him a resolute nod. “Thank you, Wes.”

He placed his hat on my head and patted me on the cheek, his eyes becoming despondent when he peered over my shoulder. I followed his gaze to Elvis, still sat on the porch, staring into the distance, as if at any moment Ben was going to come strolling over the horizon with some sardonic remark. Guilt twisted painfully in my gut the longer I watched him.

A crow glided down from the sky, landing in front of him on the porch’s railing, releasing a caw. Elvis watched if for a spell before lowering his head and taking hold of the black feathers of his beaded necklace. The crow turned to look at me, its beady obsidian eyes cutting through me making me feel cold.

“You sure he’s up for this?” I asked quietly.

My uncle’s nostrils released a mournful sigh. He leaned into the car to reposition some of the stuff he’d packed in there. “He’ll be fine. He has to be.”

I scoffed, resting my weight on one foot. “He just spent an entire night watching the corpse of his son get paraded around like a fucking puppet. No one can be fine after that.”

Wes shot a glance at me, his lips pressing together before he muttered. “He has to be…”

\-

I left Wes to finish preparing for the mad dash to these Inquisition people, returning to Riley’s bedside. She hadn’t woken up yet, but the color of life had returned to her. Whatever curse that’d befallen her gone with the destruction of the effigy. I’d cleaned away the blood and some of the ash. I hoped she was getting some real rest, but I could tell by the twitching in her brow and hitches in her breathing that it was not a peaceful slumber.

Luna was curled up beside her, wrapped in every single blanket I could find. The poor girl was so drained, so suffocated by everything she’d witnessed. It broke my heart to see her so… empty. I just prayed that if- *when* we made it out, that that little girl so full of life would come back to me.

“Aage…” my name left Riley’s pale-dry lips on a barely audible whisper.

“I’m here” I breathed, her fingers against my lips as I squeezed her hand.

Her eyelids fluttered open and she gazed up at the gauze on my face. A breath caught in her throat and her eyes began to glitter with the tears that filled them. “Aage…” she whimpered.

I brought my hand to her face, stroking her cheek with my fingers, disturbing the remaining specks of ash still clinging to her soft skin. “It’s okay. You’re okay, I took care of it.”

“Luna… Is she alright?” she asked urgently. I jerked my chin to point out the bundle beside her. A sigh of relief left Riley’s lips as her fingers curled through Luna’s hair. She began to cry, her body too weak to produce the sound as she leaned into the comfort of my hand. Her lips trembled as she tried to speak, struggling to push out the words. “It was so horrible. I… I saw things. I was in so much pain. He did… He… I wanted to die.” She laid her face into my palm and let out an excruciating sob.

I edged forward to better hold her, my own eyes burning at the helplessness I felt. I watched Luna stir, hoping that she wouldn’t wake up to this as Riley’s tears soaked into my shirt.

As a tirade of thoughts travelled through my mind, a soothing image came to me, one of peace, one of love. And despite the hopelessness that’d been chewing at me, despite seeing the woman I love in so much pain that I couldn’t alleviate, a smile began to tug at my lips.

“Do you remember that day we went to Copalis Beach?” I asked her quietly.

A pause came to her crying as she pulled away, looking up at me with some confusion. Miraculously, a laugh bubbled up through her. “We looked for clams” she chuckled, wiping some of the snot from her nostrils.

“But Luna was the only one who found any” I added.

We laughed together, the relief I felt from this stolen moment of gaiety making my eyes gently burn. Something almost like cheerfulness danced in her eyes, the sound she released somewhere between a giggle and a sob, the tension in her body loosening.

I pondered for a few moments, playing that wonderful scene in my head of Riley and Luna playing in the water, the echo of their joyous laughter swathing me. “Y’know, that was the day I realized I was in love with you.”

Her glittering eyes snapped to me, incredulity painting her features as she watched me. “We’d only been dating for like two months then.”

I shrugged, my lips tilting downwards. “Yeah, and you already had me wrapped around your finger.” She laughed at that, her head falling to my shoulder as she released a shaky breath, the both of us watching Luna sleep. “I was sat there, watching you splash around with her. I was happier than I knew was even possible. And I realized that you are the best thing to happen to either of us” I rambled, my cheek resting against her scalp.

Her eyes were narrow with suspicion when she peered up at me again. “Aage, if you propose to me right now, I swear to God I’ll create the strength to slap you.”

An ugly laugh broke out of me. “Don’t worry. When I get around to that, it’ll be way more romantic. Like so romantic, you’re gonna cry way harder than this. There’ll be fireworks, and a horse or something, a choir, a whole fucking dance routine. I don’t know what the fuck I’m saying anymore.”

Her body bounced with her chuckling. It felt good to distract her for at least a few brief moments as we held each other.

“We should go back” she mused.

“Yeah. It was a lot of fun having a little beach day” I replied, letting her scent and warmth quell my mind.

She chuckled, her fingers idly stroking my arm. “I meant Seattle. After all of this. I just want to go home.” Her voice wavered a bit, her hold on me tightening like she was at risk of falling into the void.

Quiet fell over us as the icy embrace of reality returned. My chest tightened, my voice choked and weak as I uttered “I’m so sorry, Riley.”

Her fingers tightened their grip on me as she sniffled, her body shuddering as she tried to restrain a sob but failed. I pulled her in close, wrapping an arm around her head as she pressed her face into my chest, finally letting her tears fall again. I held her for a while, biting back my own cries until she quietened again, pulling back to look at me with her drowned sparkling eyes. She stared deep into me, looking at me like she could see right down to the makings of my soul.

“I love you, Aage Crawford.”

Then she pressed her lips into mine.

\-

A crow’s caw sounded in the distance as Wes checked the protective medicine and weapons in the car for the seventh time. He let out a nervous breath then turned to me. “Okay. Everything’s ready. You okay?” he asked.

I nodded, my jaw tight with determination. “I’ve got this.”

He patted my shoulder. “I know you do” he smirked before moving to the car. “We’ll be back in a few hours. Just keep the doors locked and the windows closed, you’ll be just fine kid” he said before dropping into the car. He called for Elvis to get in, but the old man just stood on the passenger side, his eyes flicking from side to side, his lips moving wordlessly like he was fighting with himself on something.

Eventually, Elvis broke from his trance and looked my way. Releasing a long forlorn sigh, he walked over to me, grief frozen in his eyes as he looked me up and down. His gaze tracked past me for a moment, his hands moving upwards only to stall along with the breath he drew in. After hesitating, he unclasped the beads from around his neck, grabbing my hand to place the black feathers into my palm.

He looked at me again as his lips parted with a rasp, something almost like pity staining his creased features. “You did not come here by accident, Aage.” His voice was croaky from disuse, the sudden unexpected sound almost making me wince. “Fate brought you here. You serve a purpose, as we all do. As my son did. And now, no matter what happens, you must see your fate to its end. You must face the things your father has done.”

I didn’t know how to reply to that, my lips flapping pointlessly as the words failed to find me. He furled my fingers around the crow feathers he’d given me before turning and walking away, not looking back as he climbed into the car.

\-

My heart hadn’t stopped hammering since I watched Wes and Elvis drive away. My hand trembled as it brought the cigarette to my lips, my eyes tracing the horizon again and again while staring out the living room window.

It’d been almost an hour, and the fact I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the slimy fuckface only seemed to heighten the terror pulsing through my veins. There was a sick kind of relief when I heard that goddamn whistle blow through the air.

I pulled the rifle to me, propping it on my wounded forearm as I aimed. I didn’t intend to shoot if I saw him, I didn’t want to break the window if I didn’t need to. But I was certain he knew what we were up to. I wanted to be prepared for whatever he was going to throw at me.

But there was nothing, not a single bit of movement, from him or any animal. Just that piercing whistle, burrowing into me like a parasite. It went on for a while, just long enough for me to grow use to it when suddenly it went silent. Prickles bit at the back of my neck, anticipation for the onslaught I expected, but again, nothing came, until I heard the words.

“My son was weak.”

I hated the bitter way my heart still sank at the mere sound of my father’s voice. The way my breath hitched, my blood went cold, my jaw clenched. The way my entire body braced. I hated the fact that even in death, he continued to instill fear in me like he did back then.

“He couldn’t hack it in the real world. He couldn’t do what needed to be done. So, he died alone. Forgotten. Pathetic.”

“Shut the fuck up.” The words secreted from my teeth in a low quiet growl. My finger stroked the trigger of the rifle, ready, waiting, wanting.

“We all wind up alone in the end. Might as well be by choice. Might as well have all this power to play with. Might as well be what you truly are, and have the balls to finally admit you’re just another monster.”

My eyes seared, air hissing through my nostrils as the smoke sitting in my lungs caused me to cough. “You’re dead” I gasped, something in my chest biting painfully. “You’re fucking dead, and in Hell where you belong you son of a bitch. You’re dead…”

My father’s hollow laughter drifted on the wind. “We all wind up alone in the end. Every single one of us.”

A creak behind me had me almost jumping out of my skin. I turned but it was only Luna who stood in the doorway. I’d left her with Riley, allowing them both to rest since they’d need energy when we made our escape. But now here she was, standing in the living room in her pajamas watching her paranoid big brother jump at shadows with a gun in his hands. I wish this was the first time she’d seen that.

I placed the rifle down and released a breath, smoke pluming from my lips making me chuckle as I glanced down at the death-stick between my fingers. “I’m sorry. I know I promised to quit. But I’d argue if there’s any reason to…”

I trailed off when I noticed the tears that lined her eyes. Her lip was quivering. Hell, her whole body was shaking. I snuffed out the cigarette and opened my arms and she dashed towards me, leaping into me to bury her face in my chest. I coiled my arms around her as she just bawled, and I realized just how badly I’d been failing her recently.

I’d been so focused on saving Riley, on defending us, on getting us out of here, I’d forgotten to check in on her, I’d forgotten to be strong for her, to do more than give worthless lip service to make her think things will be okay. She’d watched her entire world almost die, twice. And I hadn’t stopped to let her know it was okay to cry.

My arms tightened around her, her hair tickling my nose as I pressed my face into her scalp, inhaling her smell that always gave me solace in dark times.

“Hey” I whispered, pulling away and gripping her chin. “When we get out of here, what’s the first thing you’re gonna paint?” I asked, forcing a grin as she looked up at me.

Her crying receded as she began to think about it, rubbing her reddened eyes as she sniffled. “A Thunderbird” she eventually replied.

I chuckled. “Yeah? Like the tattoo on uncle Wes’ arm?” She nodded, her delicate fingers gripping my shirt tightly. “What colors are you going to use?”

She pondered for a while, looking around for inspiration, her gaze eventually landing on the beaded necklace and feathers on the coffee table. “Matte black for the feathers. Coffee brown for the feet and beak. And… Canary yellow for the lightning. And the eyes.”

Seeing something other than fear sparkle in her eyes killed the bitterness burning the back of my throat. “Hows about, we go get your pad and your pencils, and you draw out a few sketches so that when we get the paints, we know exactly what we’re gonna do with it.”

She nodded, finally finding her smile again.

\-

The car’s horn honked rapidly. I was holding Riley up despite her protesting that she was fine. She’d bounced back pretty well from almost dying, but it was clear by the way she dragged her feet that she was still feeling a little weak.

Luna trailed behind dragging the few bags we could bring with us as we hurriedly rushed across the property to Wes’ car waiting at the road. “Nephew! Come on” Wes called, honking the horn again to urge us instead of actually helping.

The sky was turning a brilliant orange with the impending sunset, the bitter winter wind biting my cheeks as it swished around us.

We reached the road and I helped Riley prop herself up on the car. “Christ Wes, how long does it take to talk with a few priests. I was beginning to think you weren’t coming back” I remarked.

My uncle grinned. “I’m on Indian time.”

A frown sagged in my facial features as I glanced around. “Where’s Elvis?” I asked.

“With the inquisitors. Figured it was for the best, since, they’ve handled things like this before” Wes replied impatiently, surveying the horizon. “Now. Let’s drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

“Seattle” I corrected. “We’re going back to Seattle.” Riley smiled, squeezing my arm thankfully.

Wes pumped his brows and shrugged. “Okay” he said with a nod and a smile.

I helped load the few bags we could bring and planted Luna in her seat before opening the door for Riley. But I paused, something sickly writhing through me as I heard the last words Elvis said to me ringing in my ears.

Halfway in the car, Riley looked back at me, reading the look on my face instantly. “Aage, no.” She stood back up and grabbed hold of me, her grip tight in the hopes she could keep me there forever.

“Riley…” I breathed.

“No” she snapped. “Don’t fucking say it. Please. You’re coming with us.”

Wes looked back to us with a confused frown, observing silently.

I took Riley’s hands in mine, wiping away some of the moisture pooling in her eyes. “I can’t keep running from the things my father’s done.”

“No. No, please, Aage. Please don’t do this” she whimpered, tears now streaming down her cheeks as she tried to tug me to the car.

I brought my hands to her face to cup both her cheeks and wipe away her cascading tears. “Copalis Beach. Remember that. You go there and you wait for me. I’ll meet you there. Riley, if it’s the last thing I fucking do on this earth, I will meet you there. I promise.” She sobbed and begged, the flesh of her palms paling as she held on tightly to my shirt. “I have to see this to its end” I said before pressing my lips into hers.

The fervent yearning of our kiss left us suspended for what felt like an eternity while simultaneously being just a fleeting moment. When I pulled away my forehead rested against hers as my eyes traced every single line of her face, making sure I had memorized every single detail.

“I will see you at Copalis Beach. I promise” I repeated one final time before lowering her into the car.

Luna saw Riley crying, tears filling her eyes too. “You’re not coming?”

I stroked her chin and forced a grin onto my lips. “I need to handle something real quick. I’ll catch up with you.”

She reached out to me with a panicked cry. “No, Aage you have to come with us. I need you.”

I pulled her in for a hug, smelling her hair and reveling in the feeling of her in my arms. “I’ll see you later, okay?” I smiled.

Luna burst into tears and fell into Riley grabbed hold of her tight so that they may cry together. I closed the door so they couldn’t see the tears or fear rising to my eyes, glancing Wes’ way as he studied me from the other side of the car.

He scanned me, something thoughtful crossing his eyes, before he tipped his head. “Well then, I’ll see you later, Aage Crawford” he murmured, his voice a whisper, before lowering into the vehicle.

I stepped back as the car rolled away, holding Riley’s heartbroken gaze until they moved out of view. The air had staled in my lungs, my eyes burning with the world turning hazy around me.

I turned and looked up at my father’s house. *My* house.

Crows cawed all around, one leaping from a nearby rock and flying into the sky.

A resolute breath washed through me, stilling me and honing my focus to what needed to be done. Why fate brought me here.

Heading back into the house, I began to prepare. I grabbed up my father’s 1911 and my brother’s old mall katana, and used the left-over ceremonial ash to bless them both. I then stripped off my shirt, smearing ash across my torso, before donning the beaded necklace Elvis had given me, tying on the owl feathers I’d collected to hang among the crow and the medicine pouch.

I collected the spare gasoline from the generators and waltzed through the house dousing everything I could.

I poured it all over the master bedroom where my father would hurt my mother and force her into bed with him.

I splashed though my old bedroom, where I once laid awake at night, watching my baby sister sleep in the crib beside my bed, terrified about how I was going to take care of her. Where I would nearly suffocate myself below the covers of my bed, trying everything I could to block out my mother’s screams as my father beat her.

I flooded my brother’s old room, where he and I would once plot out what we were going to do when we finally escaped this place. Where he would tell me to hide when my father’s wrath found me as a target. Where I would listen and cry as my brother goaded my father into attacking him instead. Where we told ourselves hopeful lies. Where we deluded ourselves into thinking we weren’t both destined to die here.

Leaving trails down the stairs, I drenched the bathroom where his body was found in a bath of his own blood. Where my mother’s soul finally broke after decades of abuse. Where my father callously made her scrub away the evidence of his evil until the only stains left were in our minds.

I sloshed through the kitchen and soaked the carpet of the living room, the place I once saw as a warzone, every moment spent within it like walking through a minefield just waiting to blow up. Where the very air was thick with the tension my father radiated as he planned his next twisted cruelty. Where he sat and mocked my mother for mourning their son. Where he mocked his son for not being strong enough to fight back against him. Where he told his son he’d be better off drowning his own sister since he was never good enough to care for her anyway.

I then moved down into the makeshift basement that held secret the true depth of my father’s depravity. Where his sins laid buried. Where he failed to escape the one and only thing a man like him fears. The end.

After kicking over the smoking tobacco and sweet grass, I doused as much of the dirt floor as possible, over every symbol, every wooden beam. I then from my pocket pulled the lighter I’d bought when I first left this place with Luna, gliding my thumb over and appreciating the embossing of a fox one final time.

I ignited the flame and watched it dance on the end of the fox’s tail. I pulled in what felt like my first breath since watching Luna and Riley be driven away. I pulled in what felt like the first real breath above water I’d ever had.

Then I dropped the lighter.

Flames erupted through the room, climbing the walls and engulfing everything in an instant. They followed me up the stairs, rapidly spreading through the whole house, the whole rotten evil goddamn building, as I put on my uncle’s Stetson. Flames licked up the watchful owl Luna and Riley had painted as I grabbed my weapons, and walked out, leaving all that hatred to burn.

I sat down on the porch steps, listening to the satisfying crackles and pops of the fire swallowing my childhood home that was never truly a home. My mind focused solely on my true home, and the mission of getting back to them when this was over.

Another hopeful lie I suppose.

Laughter bubbled up through me unbidden, tightening my throat and tugging at my chest. I wrapped duct tape around my wounded hand, binding my pistol to it so my useless fingers could keep their grip despite the severed muscles not functioning.

The sky was a deep orange now, barely a sliver of sunlight cutting over the horizon, smoke billowing up and blending into that beautiful mosaic.

With my gun fastened to my hand, I smeared more ash across my face before picking up my brother’s katana and pushing myself to my feet, a crow cawing in the distance.

I stood waiting, the heat of the house fire on my back, watching as the light on the horizon slowly began to dim. It wasn’t long until I heard the whistle on the wind. My hand tightened around the sword as coyotes started to creep out from behind rocks and foliage, yipping and barking, watching me with ravenous glee.

Then the witch stepped out from the shadows. Skin sagging from his frail looking body, a lion pelt draped over his shoulders, bone charms spread across his skeletal torso.

Slowly, he lifted a foot, cautiously placing it forward and taking his first step across the property line. He released a giddy laugh, scuttling forward a few steps before dipping his head, snapping his teeth and smiling, the orange light of the fire dancing in his horizontally elongated pupils.

I took slow even breaths, trying to keep the fear from overtaking my body, though my hands still shook with anticipation, my own beads and feathers dancing across my bare chest. “C’mon, motherfucker” I whispered under my breath. “Come on. Make your fucking move.” My eyes darted around, dozens of coyotes now surrounded me, a small army.

The witch traipsed closer, jubilance marring his sunken features as he giggled, the movements of his body jittery and almost birdlike in its twitches. The coyotes yipped and called, insects above buzzed loudly.

Suddenly, he stopped dead, as still as a stone statue, still grinning, still staring.

“Do it” I murmured. “Do it you fuck. Just get it over with.”

His lips curled back over his bloated purple gums, the skin of his cheeks stretching as his jaw distended, his eyes fixed to me throughout the entire disturbing display. Then his gullet rippled as he released an awful screech. A woman’s scream.

It was so sudden and ear-piercing that it made me fall back a step. The corners of his mouth flexed with amusement, the cords of muscle on his throat contracting before he again expelled the terrible sound. A blood curdling scream of pain and terror, begging, pleading, crying out in agony. “Please no!”

Every part of me sank like a stone as the voice rang in my ears.

Riley’s voice…

I stumbled backwards. It couldn’t be…

“No!” the voice continued, echoing all around me, the horror of the sound’s finality sending ice through my veins.

“No! Don’t!” The witch shifted the pitch higher, sounding younger. Luna’s voice. Luna’s screams, reverberating around me as the coyotes laughed.

My hands were now trembling as tears beaded on my eyelashes. It couldn’t be them. It fucking *couldn’t* be them. They were with Wes, they were protected. He couldn’t have gotten to them.

He can only mimic what he hears… But it just couldn’t be them.

I thought back to what Wes told me.

*“Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening.”*

I steadied myself, blowing a breath to cool my roaring mind and thundering heart, lifting my chin to stare him down. “I don’t believe you” I called out.

The witch’s eyes glimmered, the flesh of his cheeks pulsing as he tilted his head. The silence stretched for a spell until a coyote came out from behind a rock, dragging something long behind it. It was about fifteen feet from me when I registered that it was dragging a human pelt, cut clean from the muscle and bone.

The coyote came close and dropped the skin in front of me before shuffling away with a yip. Deflated and flat, I could barely see the humanity that was once alive within it, but there was no mistaking the Thunderbird tattoo on the arm.

My whole world froze solid. The sound of the wind, insects, and coyotes faded away beneath the humming in my ears. My body went numb. “No…” the desperate utterance fell from my lips on a breath as the sword slipped from my fingers.

It couldn’t…

“Please! No!” Riley’s voice cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My legs gave out and I collapsed to my knees, anguish cleaving through my chest, strangling me until all I could do was rasp my pleas. “No. No you couldn’t have…”

They couldn’t be… They went with Wes… they have to be…

The witch sauntered closer, alternating between Riley and Luna’s final pleas. I stared at the skin that was once Wes, praying to a god I would never forgive that this was just some illusion, a lie, a dream.

“Please! No!” Riley cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My head hung low, strangled sobs clawing at my throat. I failed them… I promised I’d get them out. And I failed…

“We all wind up alone in the end” my father’s voice muttered as a shadow enveloped me.

I looked up at the son of a bitch, but the fight had been torn out of me. So, my arms hung loose at my sides as I waited for him to deliver his final blow, to claim his victory, to reunite me with my girls. But he just stared, smiling that fucking smile.

After an eternity suspended in a limbo worse than any Hell I can imagine, he turned his back. The coyotes all ran off into the descending darkness. The insects flew into the inky purple sky. And the witch walked away, step after step, strolling languidly into the desert. His whistle blaring through the air around me as he dipped beyond the horizon.

I didn’t even have it in me to cry any longer. It was as if my very soul had been ripped from my body. My eyes drifted upwards to the darkened sky, strips of orange cutting through the gray blanketing clouds, the final deathly screams of my entire world still echoing in my ears.

A crow cawed while watching from the railing of the porch, illuminated orange from the flames engulfing the entire house.

I let my eyes fall closed. And I placed the barrel of the pistol to my chin…",1,1763119121.0,u_CorvusTheStoryteller,0,1.0,False

 The house is still, yet something in it shakes

 The clock keeps time, but every second breaks,

 The silence hits so loud it makes you flinch;

 The smallest things now force you; hard to think  
 how absence grips the room like open prayer.

 each smile that trembled under tired eyes.  
 You curse the moments when you let it slide,  
 and now each memory cuts, and clarifies.

Why the HELL are we up and awake, speaking to each other at 4am in the morning? To then, FULLY get up at 5am in the morning? ONCE my mother            and grandmother, ARE awake? They GOTTA do the laundry, get a cup of coffee, turn the TV onto the loudest volume possible, speak amongst themselves with their LOUD voices, etc. 

But FOR SOME REASON??? I’m the problem, whenever I ask: “Can you guys be quiet?”             “Why are we talking at 5 in the morning?” I’ll turn the TV down? THAT’S a problem. I go to help out,        so they don’t have to do a bunch of shit while I’m sleeping? THAT’S a problem. Me having a LITERAL attitude, which is COMPLETELY valid? THAT’S a problem. 
I mean, they’re walking all over? Being loud as hell? Dishes are being “thrown” around? Cupboards are being opened and closed, non-stop? 

My other family members, who are ABOVE my grandma’s apartment? (My uncle and aunt who are really nice, and I love them!) They’ll STILL be asleep early in the morning, their tv won’t be on, they don’t walk around non-stop, they’re NEVER loud.

And hopefully I’m allowed to.

We needed to get the fuck out. But with Ben dead, and Elvis broken, it was easier said than done. Wes was frantically gathering up what medicine and weapons we had left, packing half into the car.

“I don’t understand why we don’t all just go now. Together” I barked, trailing behind him, hissing from the movement of my injured arm as I stumbled down the porch steps.

He dropped a rifle onto the backseat of his Honda, taking a breath before turning to me, the grave note in his eyes poking at me. “Aage, you don’t understand. These people, they don’t exist to help you. They’re sole purpose is to keep shit like this a secret.” His brows dipped, his hands flexing in a gesture brought on by helplessness. “They’ll kill you, they’ll kill Luna, they’ll kill Riley. They’ll kill all of us if they think it’ll keep the story from getting out. People like Elvis and me get a pass because we’re informants for them. We watch for what their churches can’t see. But that privilege won’t be given to you. They cannot know you were ever here.” He placed a hand on my shoulder. “Aage, if there was any other way, I’d stay as far as I possibly could get from the Inquisition. But there isn’t. They’re the only people powerful enough to keep that bastard from following us while we escape.”

A frustrated breath huffed through my teeth. “I just don’t like the idea of sitting here on my hands waiting for you to come back.”

Wes managed to convince his lips to tilt into a slight smile as he took his hat off. “You’ll do fine, kid” he said, tapping me on the chest. “It doesn’t feel like it, but this is the safest place for you. The only place he can’t set foot. You just need to keep your head on straight and be careful. He’ll try anything to trick you into letting your guard down. Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening. It’ll only be a few hours. Elvis and I will meet with the inquisitors, then we’ll come straight back here to get you. Then we’ll drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

My jaw was set as I processed everything, giving him a resolute nod. “Thank you, Wes.”

He placed his hat on my head and patted me on the cheek, his eyes becoming despondent when he peered over my shoulder. I followed his gaze to Elvis, still sat on the porch, staring into the distance, as if at any moment Ben was going to come strolling over the horizon with some sardonic remark. Guilt twisted painfully in my gut the longer I watched him.

A crow glided down from the sky, landing in front of him on the porch’s railing, releasing a caw. Elvis watched if for a spell before lowering his head and taking hold of the black feathers of his beaded necklace. The crow turned to look at me, its beady obsidian eyes cutting through me making me feel cold.

“You sure he’s up for this?” I asked quietly.

My uncle’s nostrils released a mournful sigh. He leaned into the car to reposition some of the stuff he’d packed in there. “He’ll be fine. He has to be.”

I scoffed, resting my weight on one foot. “He just spent an entire night watching the corpse of his son get paraded around like a fucking puppet. No one can be fine after that.”

Wes shot a glance at me, his lips pressing together before he muttered. “He has to be…”

\-

I left Wes to finish preparing for the mad dash to these Inquisition people, returning to Riley’s bedside. She hadn’t woken up yet, but the color of life had returned to her. Whatever curse that’d befallen her gone with the destruction of the effigy. I’d cleaned away the blood and some of the ash. I hoped she was getting some real rest, but I could tell by the twitching in her brow and hitches in her breathing that it was not a peaceful slumber.

Luna was curled up beside her, wrapped in every single blanket I could find. The poor girl was so drained, so suffocated by everything she’d witnessed. It broke my heart to see her so… empty. I just prayed that if- *when* we made it out, that that little girl so full of life would come back to me.

“Aage…” my name left Riley’s pale-dry lips on a barely audible whisper.

“I’m here” I breathed, her fingers against my lips as I squeezed her hand.

Her eyelids fluttered open and she gazed up at the gauze on my face. A breath caught in her throat and her eyes began to glitter with the tears that filled them. “Aage…” she whimpered.

I brought my hand to her face, stroking her cheek with my fingers, disturbing the remaining specks of ash still clinging to her soft skin. “It’s okay. You’re okay, I took care of it.”

“Luna… Is she alright?” she asked urgently. I jerked my chin to point out the bundle beside her. A sigh of relief left Riley’s lips as her fingers curled through Luna’s hair. She began to cry, her body too weak to produce the sound as she leaned into the comfort of my hand. Her lips trembled as she tried to speak, struggling to push out the words. “It was so horrible. I… I saw things. I was in so much pain. He did… He… I wanted to die.” She laid her face into my palm and let out an excruciating sob.

I edged forward to better hold her, my own eyes burning at the helplessness I felt. I watched Luna stir, hoping that she wouldn’t wake up to this as Riley’s tears soaked into my shirt.

As a tirade of thoughts travelled through my mind, a soothing image came to me, one of peace, one of love. And despite the hopelessness that’d been chewing at me, despite seeing the woman I love in so much pain that I couldn’t alleviate, a smile began to tug at my lips.

“Do you remember that day we went to Copalis Beach?” I asked her quietly.

A pause came to her crying as she pulled away, looking up at me with some confusion. Miraculously, a laugh bubbled up through her. “We looked for clams” she chuckled, wiping some of the snot from her nostrils.

“But Luna was the only one who found any” I added.

We laughed together, the relief I felt from this stolen moment of gaiety making my eyes gently burn. Something almost like cheerfulness danced in her eyes, the sound she released somewhere between a giggle and a sob, the tension in her body loosening.

I pondered for a few moments, playing that wonderful scene in my head of Riley and Luna playing in the water, the echo of their joyous laughter swathing me. “Y’know, that was the day I realized I was in love with you.”

Her glittering eyes snapped to me, incredulity painting her features as she watched me. “We’d only been dating for like two months then.”

I shrugged, my lips tilting downwards. “Yeah, and you already had me wrapped around your finger.” She laughed at that, her head falling to my shoulder as she released a shaky breath, the both of us watching Luna sleep. “I was sat there, watching you splash around with her. I was happier than I knew was even possible. And I realized that you are the best thing to happen to either of us” I rambled, my cheek resting against her scalp.

Her eyes were narrow with suspicion when she peered up at me again. “Aage, if you propose to me right now, I swear to God I’ll create the strength to slap you.”

An ugly laugh broke out of me. “Don’t worry. When I get around to that, it’ll be way more romantic. Like so romantic, you’re gonna cry way harder than this. There’ll be fireworks, and a horse or something, a choir, a whole fucking dance routine. I don’t know what the fuck I’m saying anymore.”

Her body bounced with her chuckling. It felt good to distract her for at least a few brief moments as we held each other.

“We should go back” she mused.

“Yeah. It was a lot of fun having a little beach day” I replied, letting her scent and warmth quell my mind.

She chuckled, her fingers idly stroking my arm. “I meant Seattle. After all of this. I just want to go home.” Her voice wavered a bit, her hold on me tightening like she was at risk of falling into the void.

Quiet fell over us as the icy embrace of reality returned. My chest tightened, my voice choked and weak as I uttered “I’m so sorry, Riley.”

Her fingers tightened their grip on me as she sniffled, her body shuddering as she tried to restrain a sob but failed. I pulled her in close, wrapping an arm around her head as she pressed her face into my chest, finally letting her tears fall again. I held her for a while, biting back my own cries until she quietened again, pulling back to look at me with her drowned sparkling eyes. She stared deep into me, looking at me like she could see right down to the makings of my soul.

“I love you, Aage Crawford.”

Then she pressed her lips into mine.

\-

A crow’s caw sounded in the distance as Wes checked the protective medicine and weapons in the car for the seventh time. He let out a nervous breath then turned to me. “Okay. Everything’s ready. You okay?” he asked.

I nodded, my jaw tight with determination. “I’ve got this.”

He patted my shoulder. “I know you do” he smirked before moving to the car. “We’ll be back in a few hours. Just keep the doors locked and the windows closed, you’ll be just fine kid” he said before dropping into the car. He called for Elvis to get in, but the old man just stood on the passenger side, his eyes flicking from side to side, his lips moving wordlessly like he was fighting with himself on something.

Eventually, Elvis broke from his trance and looked my way. Releasing a long forlorn sigh, he walked over to me, grief frozen in his eyes as he looked me up and down. His gaze tracked past me for a moment, his hands moving upwards only to stall along with the breath he drew in. After hesitating, he unclasped the beads from around his neck, grabbing my hand to place the black feathers into my palm.

He looked at me again as his lips parted with a rasp, something almost like pity staining his creased features. “You did not come here by accident, Aage.” His voice was croaky from disuse, the sudden unexpected sound almost making me wince. “Fate brought you here. You serve a purpose, as we all do. As my son did. And now, no matter what happens, you must see your fate to its end. You must face the things your father has done.”

I didn’t know how to reply to that, my lips flapping pointlessly as the words failed to find me. He furled my fingers around the crow feathers he’d given me before turning and walking away, not looking back as he climbed into the car.

\-

My heart hadn’t stopped hammering since I watched Wes and Elvis drive away. My hand trembled as it brought the cigarette to my lips, my eyes tracing the horizon again and again while staring out the living room window.

It’d been almost an hour, and the fact I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the slimy fuckface only seemed to heighten the terror pulsing through my veins. There was a sick kind of relief when I heard that goddamn whistle blow through the air.

I pulled the rifle to me, propping it on my wounded forearm as I aimed. I didn’t intend to shoot if I saw him, I didn’t want to break the window if I didn’t need to. But I was certain he knew what we were up to. I wanted to be prepared for whatever he was going to throw at me.

But there was nothing, not a single bit of movement, from him or any animal. Just that piercing whistle, burrowing into me like a parasite. It went on for a while, just long enough for me to grow use to it when suddenly it went silent. Prickles bit at the back of my neck, anticipation for the onslaught I expected, but again, nothing came, until I heard the words.

“My son was weak.”

I hated the bitter way my heart still sank at the mere sound of my father’s voice. The way my breath hitched, my blood went cold, my jaw clenched. The way my entire body braced. I hated the fact that even in death, he continued to instill fear in me like he did back then.

“He couldn’t hack it in the real world. He couldn’t do what needed to be done. So, he died alone. Forgotten. Pathetic.”

“Shut the fuck up.” The words secreted from my teeth in a low quiet growl. My finger stroked the trigger of the rifle, ready, waiting, wanting.

“We all wind up alone in the end. Might as well be by choice. Might as well have all this power to play with. Might as well be what you truly are, and have the balls to finally admit you’re just another monster.”

My eyes seared, air hissing through my nostrils as the smoke sitting in my lungs caused me to cough. “You’re dead” I gasped, something in my chest biting painfully. “You’re fucking dead, and in Hell where you belong you son of a bitch. You’re dead…”

My father’s hollow laughter drifted on the wind. “We all wind up alone in the end. Every single one of us.”

A creak behind me had me almost jumping out of my skin. I turned but it was only Luna who stood in the doorway. I’d left her with Riley, allowing them both to rest since they’d need energy when we made our escape. But now here she was, standing in the living room in her pajamas watching her paranoid big brother jump at shadows with a gun in his hands. I wish this was the first time she’d seen that.

I placed the rifle down and released a breath, smoke pluming from my lips making me chuckle as I glanced down at the death-stick between my fingers. “I’m sorry. I know I promised to quit. But I’d argue if there’s any reason to…”

I trailed off when I noticed the tears that lined her eyes. Her lip was quivering. Hell, her whole body was shaking. I snuffed out the cigarette and opened my arms and she dashed towards me, leaping into me to bury her face in my chest. I coiled my arms around her as she just bawled, and I realized just how badly I’d been failing her recently.

I’d been so focused on saving Riley, on defending us, on getting us out of here, I’d forgotten to check in on her, I’d forgotten to be strong for her, to do more than give worthless lip service to make her think things will be okay. She’d watched her entire world almost die, twice. And I hadn’t stopped to let her know it was okay to cry.

My arms tightened around her, her hair tickling my nose as I pressed my face into her scalp, inhaling her smell that always gave me solace in dark times.

“Hey” I whispered, pulling away and gripping her chin. “When we get out of here, what’s the first thing you’re gonna paint?” I asked, forcing a grin as she looked up at me.

Her crying receded as she began to think about it, rubbing her reddened eyes as she sniffled. “A Thunderbird” she eventually replied.

I chuckled. “Yeah? Like the tattoo on uncle Wes’ arm?” She nodded, her delicate fingers gripping my shirt tightly. “What colors are you going to use?”

She pondered for a while, looking around for inspiration, her gaze eventually landing on the beaded necklace and feathers on the coffee table. “Matte black for the feathers. Coffee brown for the feet and beak. And… Canary yellow for the lightning. And the eyes.”

Seeing something other than fear sparkle in her eyes killed the bitterness burning the back of my throat. “Hows about, we go get your pad and your pencils, and you draw out a few sketches so that when we get the paints, we know exactly what we’re gonna do with it.”

She nodded, finally finding her smile again.

\-

The car’s horn honked rapidly. I was holding Riley up despite her protesting that she was fine. She’d bounced back pretty well from almost dying, but it was clear by the way she dragged her feet that she was still feeling a little weak.

Luna trailed behind dragging the few bags we could bring with us as we hurriedly rushed across the property to Wes’ car waiting at the road. “Nephew! Come on” Wes called, honking the horn again to urge us instead of actually helping.

The sky was turning a brilliant orange with the impending sunset, the bitter winter wind biting my cheeks as it swished around us.

We reached the road and I helped Riley prop herself up on the car. “Christ Wes, how long does it take to talk with a few priests. I was beginning to think you weren’t coming back” I remarked.

My uncle grinned. “I’m on Indian time.”

A frown sagged in my facial features as I glanced around. “Where’s Elvis?” I asked.

“With the inquisitors. Figured it was for the best, since, they’ve handled things like this before” Wes replied impatiently, surveying the horizon. “Now. Let’s drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

“Seattle” I corrected. “We’re going back to Seattle.” Riley smiled, squeezing my arm thankfully.

Wes pumped his brows and shrugged. “Okay” he said with a nod and a smile.

I helped load the few bags we could bring and planted Luna in her seat before opening the door for Riley. But I paused, something sickly writhing through me as I heard the last words Elvis said to me ringing in my ears.

Halfway in the car, Riley looked back at me, reading the look on my face instantly. “Aage, no.” She stood back up and grabbed hold of me, her grip tight in the hopes she could keep me there forever.

“Riley…” I breathed.

“No” she snapped. “Don’t fucking say it. Please. You’re coming with us.”

Wes looked back to us with a confused frown, observing silently.

I took Riley’s hands in mine, wiping away some of the moisture pooling in her eyes. “I can’t keep running from the things my father’s done.”

“No. No, please, Aage. Please don’t do this” she whimpered, tears now streaming down her cheeks as she tried to tug me to the car.

I brought my hands to her face to cup both her cheeks and wipe away her cascading tears. “Copalis Beach. Remember that. You go there and you wait for me. I’ll meet you there. Riley, if it’s the last thing I fucking do on this earth, I will meet you there. I promise.” She sobbed and begged, the flesh of her palms paling as she held on tightly to my shirt. “I have to see this to its end” I said before pressing my lips into hers.

The fervent yearning of our kiss left us suspended for what felt like an eternity while simultaneously being just a fleeting moment. When I pulled away my forehead rested against hers as my eyes traced every single line of her face, making sure I had memorized every single detail.

“I will see you at Copalis Beach. I promise” I repeated one final time before lowering her into the car.

Luna saw Riley crying, tears filling her eyes too. “You’re not coming?”

I stroked her chin and forced a grin onto my lips. “I need to handle something real quick. I’ll catch up with you.”

She reached out to me with a panicked cry. “No, Aage you have to come with us. I need you.”

I pulled her in for a hug, smelling her hair and reveling in the feeling of her in my arms. “I’ll see you later, okay?” I smiled.

Luna burst into tears and fell into Riley grabbed hold of her tight so that they may cry together. I closed the door so they couldn’t see the tears or fear rising to my eyes, glancing Wes’ way as he studied me from the other side of the car.

He scanned me, something thoughtful crossing his eyes, before he tipped his head. “Well then, I’ll see you later, Aage Crawford” he murmured, his voice a whisper, before lowering into the vehicle.

I stepped back as the car rolled away, holding Riley’s heartbroken gaze until they moved out of view. The air had staled in my lungs, my eyes burning with the world turning hazy around me.

I turned and looked up at my father’s house. *My* house.

Crows cawed all around, one leaping from a nearby rock and flying into the sky.

A resolute breath washed through me, stilling me and honing my focus to what needed to be done. Why fate brought me here.

Heading back into the house, I began to prepare. I grabbed up my father’s 1911 and my brother’s old mall katana, and used the left-over ceremonial ash to bless them both. I then stripped off my shirt, smearing ash across my torso, before donning the beaded necklace Elvis had given me, tying on the owl feathers I’d collected to hang among the crow and the medicine pouch.

I collected the spare gasoline from the generators and waltzed through the house dousing everything I could.

I poured it all over the master bedroom where my father would hurt my mother and force her into bed with him.

I splashed though my old bedroom, where I once laid awake at night, watching my baby sister sleep in the crib beside my bed, terrified about how I was going to take care of her. Where I would nearly suffocate myself below the covers of my bed, trying everything I could to block out my mother’s screams as my father beat her.

I flooded my brother’s old room, where he and I would once plot out what we were going to do when we finally escaped this place. Where he would tell me to hide when my father’s wrath found me as a target. Where I would listen and cry as my brother goaded my father into attacking him instead. Where we told ourselves hopeful lies. Where we deluded ourselves into thinking we weren’t both destined to die here.

Leaving trails down the stairs, I drenched the bathroom where his body was found in a bath of his own blood. Where my mother’s soul finally broke after decades of abuse. Where my father callously made her scrub away the evidence of his evil until the only stains left were in our minds.

I sloshed through the kitchen and soaked the carpet of the living room, the place I once saw as a warzone, every moment spent within it like walking through a minefield just waiting to blow up. Where the very air was thick with the tension my father radiated as he planned his next twisted cruelty. Where he sat and mocked my mother for mourning their son. Where he mocked his son for not being strong enough to fight back against him. Where he told his son he’d be better off drowning his own sister since he was never good enough to care for her anyway.

I then moved down into the makeshift basement that held secret the true depth of my father’s depravity. Where his sins laid buried. Where he failed to escape the one and only thing a man like him fears. The end.

After kicking over the smoking tobacco and sweet grass, I doused as much of the dirt floor as possible, over every symbol, every wooden beam. I then from my pocket pulled the lighter I’d bought when I first left this place with Luna, gliding my thumb over and appreciating the embossing of a fox one final time.

I ignited the flame and watched it dance on the end of the fox’s tail. I pulled in what felt like my first breath since watching Luna and Riley be driven away. I pulled in what felt like the first real breath above water I’d ever had.

Then I dropped the lighter.

Flames erupted through the room, climbing the walls and engulfing everything in an instant. They followed me up the stairs, rapidly spreading through the whole house, the whole rotten evil goddamn building, as I put on my uncle’s Stetson. Flames licked up the watchful owl Luna and Riley had painted as I grabbed my weapons, and walked out, leaving all that hatred to burn.

I sat down on the porch steps, listening to the satisfying crackles and pops of the fire swallowing my childhood home that was never truly a home. My mind focused solely on my true home, and the mission of getting back to them when this was over.

Another hopeful lie I suppose.

Laughter bubbled up through me unbidden, tightening my throat and tugging at my chest. I wrapped duct tape around my wounded hand, binding my pistol to it so my useless fingers could keep their grip despite the severed muscles not functioning.

The sky was a deep orange now, barely a sliver of sunlight cutting over the horizon, smoke billowing up and blending into that beautiful mosaic.

With my gun fastened to my hand, I smeared more ash across my face before picking up my brother’s katana and pushing myself to my feet, a crow cawing in the distance.

I stood waiting, the heat of the house fire on my back, watching as the light on the horizon slowly began to dim. It wasn’t long until I heard the whistle on the wind. My hand tightened around the sword as coyotes started to creep out from behind rocks and foliage, yipping and barking, watching me with ravenous glee.

Then the witch stepped out from the shadows. Skin sagging from his frail looking body, a lion pelt draped over his shoulders, bone charms spread across his skeletal torso.

Slowly, he lifted a foot, cautiously placing it forward and taking his first step across the property line. He released a giddy laugh, scuttling forward a few steps before dipping his head, snapping his teeth and smiling, the orange light of the fire dancing in his horizontally elongated pupils.

I took slow even breaths, trying to keep the fear from overtaking my body, though my hands still shook with anticipation, my own beads and feathers dancing across my bare chest. “C’mon, motherfucker” I whispered under my breath. “Come on. Make your fucking move.” My eyes darted around, dozens of coyotes now surrounded me, a small army.

The witch traipsed closer, jubilance marring his sunken features as he giggled, the movements of his body jittery and almost birdlike in its twitches. The coyotes yipped and called, insects above buzzed loudly.

Suddenly, he stopped dead, as still as a stone statue, still grinning, still staring.

“Do it” I murmured. “Do it you fuck. Just get it over with.”

His lips curled back over his bloated purple gums, the skin of his cheeks stretching as his jaw distended, his eyes fixed to me throughout the entire disturbing display. Then his gullet rippled as he released an awful screech. A woman’s scream.

It was so sudden and ear-piercing that it made me fall back a step. The corners of his mouth flexed with amusement, the cords of muscle on his throat contracting before he again expelled the terrible sound. A blood curdling scream of pain and terror, begging, pleading, crying out in agony. “Please no!”

Every part of me sank like a stone as the voice rang in my ears.

Riley’s voice…

I stumbled backwards. It couldn’t be…

“No!” the voice continued, echoing all around me, the horror of the sound’s finality sending ice through my veins.

“No! Don’t!” The witch shifted the pitch higher, sounding younger. Luna’s voice. Luna’s screams, reverberating around me as the coyotes laughed.

My hands were now trembling as tears beaded on my eyelashes. It couldn’t be them. It fucking *couldn’t* be them. They were with Wes, they were protected. He couldn’t have gotten to them.

He can only mimic what he hears… But it just couldn’t be them.

I thought back to what Wes told me.

*“Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening.”*

I steadied myself, blowing a breath to cool my roaring mind and thundering heart, lifting my chin to stare him down. “I don’t believe you” I called out.

The witch’s eyes glimmered, the flesh of his cheeks pulsing as he tilted his head. The silence stretched for a spell until a coyote came out from behind a rock, dragging something long behind it. It was about fifteen feet from me when I registered that it was dragging a human pelt, cut clean from the muscle and bone.

The coyote came close and dropped the skin in front of me before shuffling away with a yip. Deflated and flat, I could barely see the humanity that was once alive within it, but there was no mistaking the Thunderbird tattoo on the arm.

My whole world froze solid. The sound of the wind, insects, and coyotes faded away beneath the humming in my ears. My body went numb. “No…” the desperate utterance fell from my lips on a breath as the sword slipped from my fingers.

It couldn’t…

“Please! No!” Riley’s voice cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My legs gave out and I collapsed to my knees, anguish cleaving through my chest, strangling me until all I could do was rasp my pleas. “No. No you couldn’t have…”

They couldn’t be… They went with Wes… they have to be…

The witch sauntered closer, alternating between Riley and Luna’s final pleas. I stared at the skin that was once Wes, praying to a god I would never forgive that this was just some illusion, a lie, a dream.

“Please! No!” Riley cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My head hung low, strangled sobs clawing at my throat. I failed them… I promised I’d get them out. And I failed…

“We all wind up alone in the end” my father’s voice muttered as a shadow enveloped me.

I looked up at the son of a bitch, but the fight had been torn out of me. So, my arms hung loose at my sides as I waited for him to deliver his final blow, to claim his victory, to reunite me with my girls. But he just stared, smiling that fucking smile.

TL;DR: 25M (finance, Midtown) + 25F (pediatric RN) moving from living-at-home to our first NYC apt together in Feb. $4k max for a 1BR with decent kitchen, real windows/view, near subway, and that classic “city” energy. East Village is the dream but seems tough—worth it? Other recs? 

We enjoy going to the gym, going on walks, exploring restaurants and coffee shops, and also enjoy *occasional* nightlife (bars, etc.). 

About us / must-haves

Budget: $4,000 max (all-in, including utilities if possible. Willing to slightly stretch if it’s too good to pass on.)

Layout: True 1BR (we’ve never lived together—need separate sleep/work space)

Kitchen: Actually cookable (manageable counter + storage; doesn’t need to be huge)

Windows: Decent natural light + not a brick-wall airshaft (no penthouse dreams, just livable)

Transit: <5-min walk to subway

Vibe: That “we’re in THE CITY” feeling—walkable, lively, young energy

Current lean is East Village and I loved it on a recent solo trip—bars, restaurants, St Marks energy. But everything I see in our range is either tiny, dark, or a 4th-floor walk-up with zero light. We’re hoping to find a spot in Manhattan but we haven’t ruled out DT Brooklyn / Williamsburg and we’re planning a January scouting trip to explore a bit more:

1.  Is $4k realistic for a legit 1BR in the East Village with the specs above, or am I delusional?

2.  Any other neighborhoods that hit the “city” brief but are more attainable? (Heard UWS/UES are safe/convenient but sleepy—true?)

How It Works, Types, and Benefits of VPNs","As online privacy erodes and cyber threats multiply, understanding Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) has shifted from optional to essential. With **1.75 billion people now using VPNs globally** (31% of all internet users), this technology has become a fundamental layer of digital security. Whether you're concerned about ISP tracking, need to work remotely, or simply want to stream content from another country, VPNs offer practical solutions.

This comprehensive guide will explain exactly what VPNs are, how they work, the different types available, and the tangible benefits they provide in 2025's increasingly surveilled digital landscape.

# What is a VPN?

A **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a cybersecurity tool that creates an encrypted connection between your device and the internet. Instead of connecting directly to websites through your Internet Service Provider (ISP), a VPN routes your traffic through a secure server, encrypting your data and masking your real IP address.

Think of a VPN as a secure tunnel for your internet traffic. When you use a VPN, all the data traveling between your device and the internet passes through this encrypted tunnel, making it unreadable to anyone trying to intercept it—whether that's hackers on public WiFi, your ISP tracking your browsing habits, or government surveillance programs.

The key distinction that makes VPNs powerful is their dual function: **encryption** protects the content of your communications, while **IP masking** hides your location and identity. Together, these features create a significantly more private and secure internet experience than standard connections offer.

# How Does a VPN Work?

Understanding VPN mechanics doesn't require a computer science degree. The process follows a straightforward sequence:

**1. Connection Initiation**: When you activate your VPN client (the app on your device), it establishes a connection to a VPN server operated by your VPN provider. This server could be located anywhere in the world—New York, London, Tokyo, or hundreds of other cities.

**2. Authentication**: The VPN server verifies your credentials to ensure you're an authorized user. Modern VPNs often use two-factor authentication for enhanced security, requiring both a password and a secondary verification code.

**3. Encrypted Tunnel Creation**: Once authenticated, the VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the server. This encryption typically uses **AES-256 bit encryption**—the same military-grade standard used by governments and banks worldwide. Even if someone intercepts your data, it appears as meaningless gibberish without the decryption key.

**4. IP Address Replacement**: Your real IP address (which reveals your location and can be used to identify you) is hidden. Instead, websites see the IP address of the VPN server. If you're in Chicago but connected to a VPN server in Los Angeles, websites believe you're accessing them from LA.

**5. Data Transmission**: All your internet traffic—web browsing, app usage, video streaming—flows through this secure tunnel. The VPN server receives your requests, forwards them to the destination website, receives the response, and sends it back to you through the encrypted connection.

This entire process happens in milliseconds, operating transparently in the background while you browse, stream, or work online.

# Types of VPNs

Not all VPNs serve the same purpose. Understanding the different types helps you choose the right solution for your needs:

# Personal/Consumer VPN

**Personal VPNs** are what most people think of when they hear ""VPN."" These are subscription services like [NordVPN](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1o09wcz/nordvpn_review/), ExpressVPN, or Surfshark that individuals use to protect their personal internet activity.

**Best for**: Privacy protection, streaming geo-restricted content, securing public WiFi connections, bypassing ISP throttling, and general online security.

**Key features**: User-friendly apps for all devices, large server networks in dozens of countries, optimized for streaming and torrenting, typically support 5-10 simultaneous device connections.

# Remote Access VPN

**Remote Access VPNs** allow individual users to connect securely to a private network from remote locations. These are primarily used in corporate environments.

**Best for**: Remote workers accessing company resources, businesses protecting sensitive data, employees connecting from home or while traveling.

**Key features**: Enterprise-grade security, access to internal company servers and files, often integrated with corporate authentication systems, typically requires IT department setup.

# Site-to-Site VPN

**Site-to-Site VPNs** connect entire networks to each other, rather than individual devices. Large organizations use these to link branch offices with headquarters.

**Best for**: Corporations with multiple physical locations, businesses needing to share resources across geographical boundaries, organizations requiring seamless network integration.

**Key features**: Connects entire office networks, operates at the router/gateway level, transparent to end users, requires network administration expertise.

# Mobile VPN

**Mobile VPNs** are specifically designed for smartphones and tablets, maintaining secure connections even when devices switch between WiFi and cellular networks.

**Best for**: Users who frequently move between networks, those prioritizing connection stability, mobile-first users who primarily access internet on phones or tablets.

**Key features**: Seamless network transition (WiFi to 4G/5G), maintains VPN connection during brief disconnections, optimized for mobile battery efficiency.

# VPN Protocols Explained

The **VPN protocol** is the underlying technology that determines how your data is encrypted and transmitted. Modern VPNs offer multiple protocols, each with distinct advantages:

# WireGuard

**WireGuard** represents the newest generation of VPN technology, introduced in 2016 and integrated directly into the Linux kernel in 2020.

**Strengths**: Exceptionally fast (testing shows speeds **57% faster than OpenVPN**), simple codebase of just 4,000 lines (making security audits easier), modern cryptography (ChaCha20 encryption, Curve25519 key exchange), excellent for mobile devices with seamless network switching.

**Best for**: Speed-priority activities like streaming 4K content, gaming with low latency, large file downloads, mobile users switching between networks.

**Consideration**: Uses only UDP protocol, which some restrictive networks can block more easily than protocols with TCP support.

# OpenVPN

**OpenVPN** has been the industry gold standard since 2001, renowned for its security and reliability.

**Strengths**: Open-source and extensively audited by security experts worldwide, highly configurable for different security needs, can operate on any port (including TCP port 443, making it nearly impossible to block), excellent for bypassing censorship and restrictive firewalls, works on routers and wide range of devices.

**Best for**: Maximum security requirements, accessing internet in heavily censored countries (China, Iran), users prioritizing proven security over raw speed, router-based VPN implementations.

**Consideration**: Slower than WireGuard and IKEv2 due to larger codebase and encryption overhead, more complex to configure manually.

# IKEv2/IPSec

**IKEv2** (Internet Key Exchange version 2) is a joint development by Cisco and Microsoft, particularly popular in enterprise environments.

**Strengths**: Native support on most operating systems (Windows, macOS, iOS) requiring no additional software, fast connection speeds comparable to WireGuard, exceptional stability with quick reconnection when network changes, uses **AES-256 encryption** with Perfect Forward Secrecy.

**Best for**: Mobile users who frequently switch between WiFi and cellular networks, corporate/enterprise environments, users wanting easy setup with native OS integration, situations requiring connection stability during brief network interruptions.

**Consideration**: Uses fixed UDP ports (500 and 4500), making it easier for networks to block than OpenVPN, some security researchers have raised concerns about potential NSA exploitation (though no public evidence exists).

# Benefits of Using a VPN

VPNs provide multiple practical advantages that address real-world privacy and security challenges:

# Privacy Protection from ISP Tracking

Your Internet Service Provider can see every website you visit, every search query you make, and every video you stream. **47% of VPN users cite enhanced privacy as their primary motivation** for using the technology.

A VPN prevents your ISP from monitoring, logging, or selling your browsing data to advertisers and data brokers. All your ISP sees is encrypted traffic going to a VPN server—the actual content remains invisible.

# Security on Public WiFi Networks

Public WiFi networks at coffee shops, airports, hotels, and libraries are notoriously insecure. Hackers use these networks to execute Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, intercepting sensitive data like passwords and credit card information.

VPNs encrypt all data before it leaves your device, making intercepted traffic unreadable. Even if a hacker captures your data stream on public WiFi, they receive only encrypted gibberish without the decryption key.

# Bypass Geo-Restrictions and Access Streaming Content

**46% of personal VPN users** employ the technology to access streaming services and region-locked content. VPNs allow you to connect to servers in different countries, making it appear you're accessing content from that location.

This capability enables travelers to watch their home country's Netflix library abroad, access region-exclusive sports broadcasts, or bypass geographic licensing restrictions on YouTube videos and other platforms.

# Secure Remote Work Access

The rise of remote work has made VPNs essential for business operations. Remote Access VPNs allow employees to securely connect to company networks from home or while traveling, accessing internal files, databases, and applications as if they were in the office.

For businesses, this protects sensitive company data while enabling flexible work arrangements. For employees, it ensures their work activities remain private and secure, even on home networks.

# Circumvent Censorship and Internet Restrictions

Countries like China, Iran, Turkey, and Russia impose heavy internet censorship, blocking access to social media platforms, news websites, and communication tools. VPNs help users in these regions access the free and open internet.

By connecting to VPN servers in countries without censorship, users can bypass government-imposed restrictions while protecting themselves from surveillance. OpenVPN's ability to disguise VPN traffic as regular HTTPS traffic makes it particularly effective for this purpose.

# Prevent ISP Throttling

Many ISPs deliberately slow down (throttle) internet speeds for bandwidth-intensive activities like streaming video or torrenting. Since a VPN hides what you're doing online from your ISP, they cannot selectively throttle specific types of traffic.

This often results in faster, more consistent speeds for activities that would otherwise be throttled, particularly for streaming services during peak hours.

# Anonymous Torrenting and P2P File Sharing

While torrenting legal content is perfectly legitimate, many ISPs restrict or monitor P2P traffic. VPNs encrypt torrent traffic and hide your IP address from other users in the torrent swarm.

This protects your privacy during file sharing and prevents your ISP from sending warning letters or throttling your connection based on P2P activity.

# Important Limitations of VPNs

While VPNs are powerful privacy tools, it's crucial to understand what they cannot do:

**VPNs Don't Provide Complete Anonymity**: Despite marketing claims, VPNs don't make you invisible online. Websites can still track you through cookies, browser fingerprinting, and account logins. If you log into your Facebook account while using a VPN, Facebook still knows it's you.

**No Protection Against Malware or Phishing**: VPNs encrypt your connection but don't protect you from clicking malicious links, downloading infected files, or falling for phishing scams. You still need antivirus software and safe browsing practices.

**Vulnerable to Weak Passwords and Social Engineering**: If your password is ""password123"" or you share sensitive information with someone impersonating your bank, a VPN won't help. It protects data in transit, not poor security decisions.

**Browser Fingerprinting Still Works**: Advanced tracking techniques can still identify you based on your unique browser configuration, screen resolution, installed fonts, and other characteristics—even with a VPN active.

**Not a Substitute for Comprehensive Security**: VPNs work best as one layer in a multi-layered security approach that includes strong passwords, two-factor authentication, regular software updates, and security-aware behavior.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Is it legal to use a VPN?**

VPNs are legal in most countries, including the United States, Canada, UK, and most of Europe. However, some nations ([China](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1njaoxp/best_vpns_for_china/), Russia, Iran, [UAE](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1ogdowr/best_vpns_for_uae/)) restrict or ban VPN usage. Using a VPN for illegal activities remains illegal regardless of location. Always check local laws before using a VPN, especially when traveling.

**Does a VPN slow down my internet speed?**

VPNs add encryption overhead and route traffic through remote servers, which typically reduces speeds by 5-30%. However, modern protocols like WireGuard minimize this impact. Premium VPNs with optimized server networks often show minimal speed reduction. In some cases, VPNs can actually improve speeds by preventing ISP throttling.

**Can my VPN be traced back to me?**

Reputable VPN providers with strict no-logs policies cannot provide information about your activities because they don't store it. However, if you're logged into accounts or have poor operational security, other methods can identify you. VPNs provide privacy, not perfect anonymity.

**Are free VPNs safe to use?**

Most free VPNs compromise your privacy by logging and selling your data to advertisers, showing intrusive ads, or imposing severe bandwidth and speed limitations. They often lack proper security measures. If you're not paying for the product, you are the product. Premium VPNs starting at $2-5/month offer significantly better security, privacy, and performance.

# Conclusion

VPNs have evolved from niche security tools to essential privacy infrastructure in our hyper-connected world. By encrypting your internet traffic and masking your IP address, VPNs provide meaningful protection against ISP monitoring, public WiFi threats, geo-restrictions, and censorship.

Understanding the different types of VPNs, protocols, and their specific use cases empowers you to choose the right solution for your needs. Whether you're a remote worker requiring secure corporate access, a privacy-conscious individual protecting personal data, or a traveler accessing home content abroad, VPNs offer practical benefits that address real-world challenges.

However, remember that VPNs are one component of comprehensive digital security, not a magic solution. Combine VPN usage with strong passwords, two-factor authentication, updated software, and security-aware behavior for optimal protection complex threat landscape.",1,1763118203.0,VPNforFreedom,0,1.0,False

I'm a solo dev building a new budgeting app called **Expenzez**. I posted a while back and got some incredibly valuable (and brutally honest!) feedback, especially about the fact that my app uses **manual CSV uploads**.

I get it. In a world of automated apps, a manual upload is a huge pain.

My core mission is to build an app for people who feel **genuinely anxious about their day-to-day spending**. My app's strength isn't convenience; it's its **AI Financial Coach**.

So, my question for you is: **What ""killer feature"" would make that manual upload worth the hassle for you?**

My main idea is to build a powerful, proactive **""Safe-to-Spend""** feature.

Here's how it would work:

1. You upload your CSV.
2. The AI instantly identifies all your income, recurring bills (rent, phone, subscriptions), and savings goals.
3. It does all the hard math and gives you one simple number on your home screen: **""You have £11.50 per day that is 'safe to spend' on variable costs (like food, coffee, transport) until your next payday.""**

The goal is to completely remove that daily mental anxiety of ""Can I afford this?""

**Here's the honest reason it's CSV-only (for now):** As a solo founder, the £15k+ cost for Open Banking is a massive wall. My strategy is to launch this **Manual MVP first** (to keep the app free/low-cost) and prove that the AI coach is valuable. My long-term plan is to use the revenue from this version to **fund the full Open Banking integration in Phase 2.**

**So, my questions for the community are:**

1. Is that ""Safe-to-Spend"" number a powerful enough feature to make you bother with a CSV upload in the short term?
2. Does knowing that this is a ""Phase 1"" and that Open Banking is the ultimate goal make you more likely to try it?
3. What other ""killer insights"" would you need to see from an AI coach?

My app is live on the App Store (`https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expenzez/id6751338089`) so you can see the design. I'm asking for your help to build the *right* thing.

Thanks for your honesty.

Every morning I bring my kiddo to school and come back home (+-1hour commute). I have to wake up really early just so my body feels ok to go outside, because I feel miserable when I wake up. Need my 20 min morning cry on the couch, lol. Then I wake kiddo and we watch a cartoon when I drink coffee and after that the morning rush begins. I have to think what I carry outside because I'm unable to carry a backpack, and lately smaller shoulderbags have been causing some issue.

Lately when I get home I'm unable to do things before I pick my kid up from school again. My upperback is killing me from cooking and doing dishes and so much brain fog. I try to get at least one thing done like tidying the living room or kids bedroom. 

Usually kiddo goes to their father on fridays, but this week on sunday, so I'm fighting crashing down, yeey! I'm not gonna cook tonight, probably a pizza movie night.

I got into coffee during lockdown, when I had not much to do with my day. It started with burning coffee on a generic mokapot, which gradually got better and eventually I got an Aeropress GO.

When brewing coffee became a ritual to me, I got a grinder. Then an espresso machine, then a v60, another grinder, picopresso, kalita, this kettle, that scale, and what not :D

Basically, I also got into this rabbit hole like most of us do.

It became more about brewing than actually enjoying the cup, before I ditched the obsession and landed back to my Aeropress with 1Zpresso Q as my travel companion.

I don't use a scale or temperature setting anymore. I grind light or medium roast in full capacity (for Q it is about 20g) top my Aeropress with almost boiling hot water, stir, wait for 3 to 5 min, press with the flowcontrol cap and enjoy my cup!

Besides motorcycles, coffee has been a constant ever since. So, I wanted a tattoo about coffee. And upon looking back, the one brewer that has been my constant friend is an Aeropress :)

We needed to get the fuck out. But with Ben dead, and Elvis broken, it was easier said than done. Wes was frantically gathering up what medicine and weapons we had left, packing half into the car.

“I don’t understand why we don’t all just go now. Together” I barked, trailing behind him, hissing from the movement of my injured arm as I stumbled down the porch steps.

He dropped a rifle onto the backseat of his Honda, taking a breath before turning to me, the grave note in his eyes poking at me. “Aage, you don’t understand. These people, they don’t exist to help you. They’re sole purpose is to keep shit like this a secret.” His brows dipped, his hands flexing in a gesture brought on by helplessness. “They’ll kill you, they’ll kill Luna, they’ll kill Riley. They’ll kill all of us if they think it’ll keep the story from getting out. People like Elvis and me get a pass because we’re informants for them. We watch for what their churches can’t see. But that privilege won’t be given to you. They cannot know you were ever here.” He placed a hand on my shoulder. “Aage, if there was any other way, I’d stay as far as I possibly could get from the Inquisition. But there isn’t. They’re the only people powerful enough to keep that bastard from following us while we escape.”

A frustrated breath huffed through my teeth. “I just don’t like the idea of sitting here on my hands waiting for you to come back.”

Wes managed to convince his lips to tilt into a slight smile as he took his hat off. “You’ll do fine, kid” he said, tapping me on the chest. “It doesn’t feel like it, but this is the safest place for you. The only place he can’t set foot. You just need to keep your head on straight and be careful. He’ll try anything to trick you into letting your guard down. Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening. It’ll only be a few hours. Elvis and I will meet with the inquisitors, then we’ll come straight back here to get you. Then we’ll drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

My jaw was set as I processed everything, giving him a resolute nod. “Thank you, Wes.”

He placed his hat on my head and patted me on the cheek, his eyes becoming despondent when he peered over my shoulder. I followed his gaze to Elvis, still sat on the porch, staring into the distance, as if at any moment Ben was going to come strolling over the horizon with some sardonic remark. Guilt twisted painfully in my gut the longer I watched him.

A crow glided down from the sky, landing in front of him on the porch’s railing, releasing a caw. Elvis watched if for a spell before lowering his head and taking hold of the black feathers of his beaded necklace. The crow turned to look at me, its beady obsidian eyes cutting through me making me feel cold.

“You sure he’s up for this?” I asked quietly.

My uncle’s nostrils released a mournful sigh. He leaned into the car to reposition some of the stuff he’d packed in there. “He’ll be fine. He has to be.”

I scoffed, resting my weight on one foot. “He just spent an entire night watching the corpse of his son get paraded around like a fucking puppet. No one can be fine after that.”

Wes shot a glance at me, his lips pressing together before he muttered. “He has to be…”

\-

I left Wes to finish preparing for the mad dash to these Inquisition people, returning to Riley’s bedside. She hadn’t woken up yet, but the color of life had returned to her. Whatever curse that’d befallen her gone with the destruction of the effigy. I’d cleaned away the blood and some of the ash. I hoped she was getting some real rest, but I could tell by the twitching in her brow and hitches in her breathing that it was not a peaceful slumber.

Luna was curled up beside her, wrapped in every single blanket I could find. The poor girl was so drained, so suffocated by everything she’d witnessed. It broke my heart to see her so… empty. I just prayed that if- *when* we made it out, that that little girl so full of life would come back to me.

“Aage…” my name left Riley’s pale-dry lips on a barely audible whisper.

“I’m here” I breathed, her fingers against my lips as I squeezed her hand.

Her eyelids fluttered open and she gazed up at the gauze on my face. A breath caught in her throat and her eyes began to glitter with the tears that filled them. “Aage…” she whimpered.

I brought my hand to her face, stroking her cheek with my fingers, disturbing the remaining specks of ash still clinging to her soft skin. “It’s okay. You’re okay, I took care of it.”

“Luna… Is she alright?” she asked urgently. I jerked my chin to point out the bundle beside her. A sigh of relief left Riley’s lips as her fingers curled through Luna’s hair. She began to cry, her body too weak to produce the sound as she leaned into the comfort of my hand. Her lips trembled as she tried to speak, struggling to push out the words. “It was so horrible. I… I saw things. I was in so much pain. He did… He… I wanted to die.” She laid her face into my palm and let out an excruciating sob.

I edged forward to better hold her, my own eyes burning at the helplessness I felt. I watched Luna stir, hoping that she wouldn’t wake up to this as Riley’s tears soaked into my shirt.

As a tirade of thoughts travelled through my mind, a soothing image came to me, one of peace, one of love. And despite the hopelessness that’d been chewing at me, despite seeing the woman I love in so much pain that I couldn’t alleviate, a smile began to tug at my lips.

“Do you remember that day we went to Copalis Beach?” I asked her quietly.

A pause came to her crying as she pulled away, looking up at me with some confusion. Miraculously, a laugh bubbled up through her. “We looked for clams” she chuckled, wiping some of the snot from her nostrils.

“But Luna was the only one who found any” I added.

We laughed together, the relief I felt from this stolen moment of gaiety making my eyes gently burn. Something almost like cheerfulness danced in her eyes, the sound she released somewhere between a giggle and a sob, the tension in her body loosening.

I pondered for a few moments, playing that wonderful scene in my head of Riley and Luna playing in the water, the echo of their joyous laughter swathing me. “Y’know, that was the day I realized I was in love with you.”

Her glittering eyes snapped to me, incredulity painting her features as she watched me. “We’d only been dating for like two months then.”

I shrugged, my lips tilting downwards. “Yeah, and you already had me wrapped around your finger.” She laughed at that, her head falling to my shoulder as she released a shaky breath, the both of us watching Luna sleep. “I was sat there, watching you splash around with her. I was happier than I knew was even possible. And I realized that you are the best thing to happen to either of us” I rambled, my cheek resting against her scalp.

Her eyes were narrow with suspicion when she peered up at me again. “Aage, if you propose to me right now, I swear to God I’ll create the strength to slap you.”

An ugly laugh broke out of me. “Don’t worry. When I get around to that, it’ll be way more romantic. Like so romantic, you’re gonna cry way harder than this. There’ll be fireworks, and a horse or something, a choir, a whole fucking dance routine. I don’t know what the fuck I’m saying anymore.”

Her body bounced with her chuckling. It felt good to distract her for at least a few brief moments as we held each other.

“We should go back” she mused.

“Yeah. It was a lot of fun having a little beach day” I replied, letting her scent and warmth quell my mind.

She chuckled, her fingers idly stroking my arm. “I meant Seattle. After all of this. I just want to go home.” Her voice wavered a bit, her hold on me tightening like she was at risk of falling into the void.

Quiet fell over us as the icy embrace of reality returned. My chest tightened, my voice choked and weak as I uttered “I’m so sorry, Riley.”

Her fingers tightened their grip on me as she sniffled, her body shuddering as she tried to restrain a sob but failed. I pulled her in close, wrapping an arm around her head as she pressed her face into my chest, finally letting her tears fall again. I held her for a while, biting back my own cries until she quietened again, pulling back to look at me with her drowned sparkling eyes. She stared deep into me, looking at me like she could see right down to the makings of my soul.

“I love you, Aage Crawford.”

Then she pressed her lips into mine.

\-

A crow’s caw sounded in the distance as Wes checked the protective medicine and weapons in the car for the seventh time. He let out a nervous breath then turned to me. “Okay. Everything’s ready. You okay?” he asked.

I nodded, my jaw tight with determination. “I’ve got this.”

He patted my shoulder. “I know you do” he smirked before moving to the car. “We’ll be back in a few hours. Just keep the doors locked and the windows closed, you’ll be just fine kid” he said before dropping into the car. He called for Elvis to get in, but the old man just stood on the passenger side, his eyes flicking from side to side, his lips moving wordlessly like he was fighting with himself on something.

Eventually, Elvis broke from his trance and looked my way. Releasing a long forlorn sigh, he walked over to me, grief frozen in his eyes as he looked me up and down. His gaze tracked past me for a moment, his hands moving upwards only to stall along with the breath he drew in. After hesitating, he unclasped the beads from around his neck, grabbing my hand to place the black feathers into my palm.

He looked at me again as his lips parted with a rasp, something almost like pity staining his creased features. “You did not come here by accident, Aage.” His voice was croaky from disuse, the sudden unexpected sound almost making me wince. “Fate brought you here. You serve a purpose, as we all do. As my son did. And now, no matter what happens, you must see your fate to its end. You must face the things your father has done.”

I didn’t know how to reply to that, my lips flapping pointlessly as the words failed to find me. He furled my fingers around the crow feathers he’d given me before turning and walking away, not looking back as he climbed into the car.

\-

My heart hadn’t stopped hammering since I watched Wes and Elvis drive away. My hand trembled as it brought the cigarette to my lips, my eyes tracing the horizon again and again while staring out the living room window.

It’d been almost an hour, and the fact I hadn’t seen hide nor hair of the slimy fuckface only seemed to heighten the terror pulsing through my veins. There was a sick kind of relief when I heard that goddamn whistle blow through the air.

I pulled the rifle to me, propping it on my wounded forearm as I aimed. I didn’t intend to shoot if I saw him, I didn’t want to break the window if I didn’t need to. But I was certain he knew what we were up to. I wanted to be prepared for whatever he was going to throw at me.

But there was nothing, not a single bit of movement, from him or any animal. Just that piercing whistle, burrowing into me like a parasite. It went on for a while, just long enough for me to grow use to it when suddenly it went silent. Prickles bit at the back of my neck, anticipation for the onslaught I expected, but again, nothing came, until I heard the words.

“My son was weak.”

I hated the bitter way my heart still sank at the mere sound of my father’s voice. The way my breath hitched, my blood went cold, my jaw clenched. The way my entire body braced. I hated the fact that even in death, he continued to instill fear in me like he did back then.

“He couldn’t hack it in the real world. He couldn’t do what needed to be done. So, he died alone. Forgotten. Pathetic.”

“Shut the fuck up.” The words secreted from my teeth in a low quiet growl. My finger stroked the trigger of the rifle, ready, waiting, wanting.

“We all wind up alone in the end. Might as well be by choice. Might as well have all this power to play with. Might as well be what you truly are, and have the balls to finally admit you’re just another monster.”

My eyes seared, air hissing through my nostrils as the smoke sitting in my lungs caused me to cough. “You’re dead” I gasped, something in my chest biting painfully. “You’re fucking dead, and in Hell where you belong you son of a bitch. You’re dead…”

My father’s hollow laughter drifted on the wind. “We all wind up alone in the end. Every single one of us.”

A creak behind me had me almost jumping out of my skin. I turned but it was only Luna who stood in the doorway. I’d left her with Riley, allowing them both to rest since they’d need energy when we made our escape. But now here she was, standing in the living room in her pajamas watching her paranoid big brother jump at shadows with a gun in his hands. I wish this was the first time she’d seen that.

I placed the rifle down and released a breath, smoke pluming from my lips making me chuckle as I glanced down at the death-stick between my fingers. “I’m sorry. I know I promised to quit. But I’d argue if there’s any reason to…”

I trailed off when I noticed the tears that lined her eyes. Her lip was quivering. Hell, her whole body was shaking. I snuffed out the cigarette and opened my arms and she dashed towards me, leaping into me to bury her face in my chest. I coiled my arms around her as she just bawled, and I realized just how badly I’d been failing her recently.

I’d been so focused on saving Riley, on defending us, on getting us out of here, I’d forgotten to check in on her, I’d forgotten to be strong for her, to do more than give worthless lip service to make her think things will be okay. She’d watched her entire world almost die, twice. And I hadn’t stopped to let her know it was okay to cry.

My arms tightened around her, her hair tickling my nose as I pressed my face into her scalp, inhaling her smell that always gave me solace in dark times.

“Hey” I whispered, pulling away and gripping her chin. “When we get out of here, what’s the first thing you’re gonna paint?” I asked, forcing a grin as she looked up at me.

Her crying receded as she began to think about it, rubbing her reddened eyes as she sniffled. “A Thunderbird” she eventually replied.

I chuckled. “Yeah? Like the tattoo on uncle Wes’ arm?” She nodded, her delicate fingers gripping my shirt tightly. “What colors are you going to use?”

She pondered for a while, looking around for inspiration, her gaze eventually landing on the beaded necklace and feathers on the coffee table. “Matte black for the feathers. Coffee brown for the feet and beak. And… Canary yellow for the lightning. And the eyes.”

Seeing something other than fear sparkle in her eyes killed the bitterness burning the back of my throat. “Hows about, we go get your pad and your pencils, and you draw out a few sketches so that when we get the paints, we know exactly what we’re gonna do with it.”

She nodded, finally finding her smile again.

\-

The car’s horn honked rapidly. I was holding Riley up despite her protesting that she was fine. She’d bounced back pretty well from almost dying, but it was clear by the way she dragged her feet that she was still feeling a little weak.

Luna trailed behind dragging the few bags we could bring with us as we hurriedly rushed across the property to Wes’ car waiting at the road. “Nephew! Come on” Wes called, honking the horn again to urge us instead of actually helping.

The sky was turning a brilliant orange with the impending sunset, the bitter winter wind biting my cheeks as it swished around us.

We reached the road and I helped Riley prop herself up on the car. “Christ Wes, how long does it take to talk with a few priests. I was beginning to think you weren’t coming back” I remarked.

My uncle grinned. “I’m on Indian time.”

A frown sagged in my facial features as I glanced around. “Where’s Elvis?” I asked.

“With the inquisitors. Figured it was for the best, since, they’ve handled things like this before” Wes replied impatiently, surveying the horizon. “Now. Let’s drive until we reach the fucking Atlantic.”

“Seattle” I corrected. “We’re going back to Seattle.” Riley smiled, squeezing my arm thankfully.

Wes pumped his brows and shrugged. “Okay” he said with a nod and a smile.

I helped load the few bags we could bring and planted Luna in her seat before opening the door for Riley. But I paused, something sickly writhing through me as I heard the last words Elvis said to me ringing in my ears.

Halfway in the car, Riley looked back at me, reading the look on my face instantly. “Aage, no.” She stood back up and grabbed hold of me, her grip tight in the hopes she could keep me there forever.

“Riley…” I breathed.

“No” she snapped. “Don’t fucking say it. Please. You’re coming with us.”

Wes looked back to us with a confused frown, observing silently.

I took Riley’s hands in mine, wiping away some of the moisture pooling in her eyes. “I can’t keep running from the things my father’s done.”

“No. No, please, Aage. Please don’t do this” she whimpered, tears now streaming down her cheeks as she tried to tug me to the car.

I brought my hands to her face to cup both her cheeks and wipe away her cascading tears. “Copalis Beach. Remember that. You go there and you wait for me. I’ll meet you there. Riley, if it’s the last thing I fucking do on this earth, I will meet you there. I promise.” She sobbed and begged, the flesh of her palms paling as she held on tightly to my shirt. “I have to see this to its end” I said before pressing my lips into hers.

The fervent yearning of our kiss left us suspended for what felt like an eternity while simultaneously being just a fleeting moment. When I pulled away my forehead rested against hers as my eyes traced every single line of her face, making sure I had memorized every single detail.

“I will see you at Copalis Beach. I promise” I repeated one final time before lowering her into the car.

Luna saw Riley crying, tears filling her eyes too. “You’re not coming?”

I stroked her chin and forced a grin onto my lips. “I need to handle something real quick. I’ll catch up with you.”

She reached out to me with a panicked cry. “No, Aage you have to come with us. I need you.”

I pulled her in for a hug, smelling her hair and reveling in the feeling of her in my arms. “I’ll see you later, okay?” I smiled.

Luna burst into tears and fell into Riley who grabbed hold of her tight so that they may cry together. I closed the door so they couldn’t see the tears or fear rising to my eyes, glancing Wes’ way as he studied me from the other side of the car.

He scanned me, something thoughtful crossing his eyes, before he tipped his head. “Well then, I’ll see you later, Aage Crawford” he murmured, his voice a whisper, before lowering into the vehicle.

I stepped back as the car rolled away, holding Riley’s heartbroken gaze until they moved out of view. The air had staled in my lungs, my eyes burning with the world turning hazy around me.

I turned and looked up at my father’s house. *My* house.

Crows cawed all around, one leaping from a nearby rock and flying into the sky.

A resolute breath washed through me, stilling me and honing my focus to what needed to be done. Why fate brought me here.

Heading back into the house, I began to prepare. I grabbed up my father’s 1911 and my brother’s old mall katana, and used the left-over ceremonial ash to bless them both. I then stripped off my shirt, smearing ash across my torso, before donning the beaded necklace Elvis had given me, tying on the owl feathers I’d collected to hang among the crow and the medicine pouch.

I collected the spare gasoline from the generators and waltzed through the house dousing everything I could.

I poured it all over the master bedroom where my father would hurt my mother and force her into bed with him.

I splashed though my old bedroom, where I once laid awake at night, watching my baby sister sleep in the crib beside my bed, terrified about how I was going to take care of her. Where I would nearly suffocate myself below the covers of my bed, trying everything I could to block out my mother’s screams as my father beat her.

I flooded my brother’s old room, where he and I would once plot out what we were going to do when we finally escaped this place. Where he would tell me to hide when my father’s wrath found me as a target. Where I would listen and cry as my brother goaded my father into attacking him instead. Where we told ourselves hopeful lies. Where we deluded ourselves into thinking we weren’t both destined to die here.

Leaving trails down the stairs, I drenched the bathroom where his body was found in a bath of his own blood. Where my mother’s soul finally broke after decades of abuse. Where my father callously made her scrub away the evidence of his evil until the only stains left were in our minds.

I sloshed through the kitchen and soaked the carpet of the living room, the place I once saw as a warzone, every moment spent within it like walking through a minefield just waiting to blow up. Where the very air was thick with the tension my father radiated as he planned his next twisted cruelty. Where he sat and mocked my mother for mourning their son. Where he mocked his son for not being strong enough to fight back against him. Where he told his son he’d be better off drowning his own sister since he was never good enough to care for her anyway.

I then moved down into the makeshift basement that held secret the true depth of my father’s depravity. Where his sins laid buried. Where he failed to escape the one and only thing a man like him fears. The end.

After kicking over the smoking tobacco and sweet grass, I doused as much of the dirt floor as possible, over every symbol, every wooden beam. I then from my pocket pulled the lighter I’d bought when I first left this place with Luna, gliding my thumb over and appreciating the embossing of a fox one final time.

I ignited the flame and watched it dance on the end of the fox’s tail. I pulled in what felt like my first breath since watching Luna and Riley be driven away. I pulled in what felt like the first real breath above water I’d ever had.

Then I dropped the lighter.

Flames erupted through the room, climbing the walls and engulfing everything in an instant. They followed me up the stairs, rapidly spreading through the whole house, the whole rotten evil goddamn building, as I put on my uncle’s Stetson. Flames licked up the watchful owl Luna and Riley had painted as I grabbed my weapons, and walked out, leaving all that hatred to burn.

I sat down on the porch steps, listening to the satisfying crackles and pops of the fire swallowing my childhood home that was never truly a home. My mind focused solely on my true home, and the mission of getting back to them when this was over.

Another hopeful lie I suppose.

Laughter bubbled up through me unbidden, tightening my throat and tugging at my chest. I wrapped duct tape around my wounded hand, binding my pistol to it so my useless fingers could keep their grip despite the severed muscles not functioning.

The sky was a deep orange now, barely a sliver of sunlight cutting over the horizon, smoke billowing up and blending into that beautiful mosaic.

With my gun fastened to my hand, I smeared more ash across my face before picking up my brother’s katana and pushing myself to my feet, a crow cawing in the distance.

I stood waiting, the heat of the house fire on my back, watching as the light on the horizon slowly began to dim. It wasn’t long until I heard the whistle on the wind. My hand tightened around the sword as coyotes started to creep out from behind rocks and foliage, yipping and barking, watching me with ravenous glee.

Then the witch stepped out from the shadows. Skin sagging from his frail looking body, a lion pelt draped over his shoulders, bone charms spread across his skeletal torso.

Slowly, he lifted a foot, cautiously placing it forward and taking his first step across the property line. He released a giddy laugh, scuttling forward a few steps before dipping his head, snapping his teeth and smiling, the orange light of the fire dancing in his horizontally elongated pupils.

I took slow even breaths, trying to keep the fear from overtaking my body, though my hands still shook with anticipation, my own beads and feathers dancing across my bare chest. “C’mon, motherfucker” I whispered under my breath. “Come on. Make your fucking move.” My eyes darted around, dozens of coyotes now surrounded me, a small army.

The witch traipsed closer, jubilance marring his sunken features as he giggled, the movements of his body jittery and almost birdlike in its twitches. The coyotes yipped and called, insects above buzzed loudly.

Suddenly, he stopped dead, as still as a stone statue, still grinning, still staring.

“Do it” I murmured. “Do it you fuck. Just get it over with.”

His lips curled back over his bloated purple gums, the skin of his cheeks stretching as his jaw distended, his eyes fixed to me throughout the entire disturbing display. Then his gullet rippled as he released an awful screech. A woman’s scream.

It was so sudden and ear-piercing that it made me fall back a step. The corners of his mouth flexed with amusement, the cords of muscle on his throat contracting before he again expelled the terrible sound. A blood curdling scream of pain and terror, begging, pleading, crying out in agony. “Please no!”

Every part of me sank like a stone as the voice rang in my ears.

Riley’s voice…

I stumbled backwards. It couldn’t be…

“No!” the voice continued, echoing all around me, the horror of the sound’s finality sending ice through my veins.

“No! Don’t!” The witch shifted the pitch higher, sounding younger. Luna’s voice. Luna’s screams, reverberating around me as the coyotes laughed.

My hands were now trembling as tears beaded on my eyelashes. It couldn’t be them. It fucking *couldn’t* be them. They were with Wes, they were protected. He couldn’t have gotten to them.

He can only mimic what he hears… But it just couldn’t be them.

I thought back to what Wes told me.

*“Don’t believe anything you hear or see. Don’t give him an opening.”*

I steadied myself, blowing a breath to cool my roaring mind and thundering heart, lifting my chin to stare him down. “I don’t believe you” I called out.

The witch’s eyes glimmered, the flesh of his cheeks pulsing as he tilted his head. The silence stretched for a spell until a coyote came out from behind a rock, dragging something long behind it. It was about fifteen feet from me when I registered that it was dragging a human pelt, cut clean from the muscle and bone.

The coyote came close and dropped the skin in front of me before shuffling away with a yip. Deflated and flat, I could barely see the humanity that was once alive within it, but there was no mistaking the Thunderbird tattoo on the arm.

My whole world froze solid. The sound of the wind, insects, and coyotes faded away beneath the humming in my ears. My body went numb. “No…” the desperate utterance fell from my lips on a breath as the sword slipped from my fingers.

It couldn’t…

“Please! No!” Riley’s voice cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My legs gave out and I collapsed to my knees, anguish cleaving through my chest, strangling me until all I could do was rasp my pleas. “No. No you couldn’t have…”

They couldn’t be… They went with Wes… they have to be…

The witch sauntered closer, alternating between Riley and Luna’s final pleas. I stared at the skin that was once Wes, praying to a god I would never forgive that this was just some illusion, a lie, a dream.

“Please! No!” Riley cried.

“No! Don’t!” Luna screamed.

My head hung low, strangled sobs clawing at my throat. I failed them… I promised I’d get them out. And I failed…

“We all wind up alone in the end” my father’s voice muttered as a shadow enveloped me.

I looked up at the son of a bitch, but the fight had been torn out of me. So, my arms hung loose at my sides as I waited for him to deliver his final blow, to claim his victory, to reunite me with my girls. But he just stared, smiling that fucking smile.

After an eternity suspended in a limbo worse than any Hell I can imagine, he turned his back. The coyotes all ran off into the descending darkness. The insects flew into the inky purple sky. And the witch walked away, step after step, strolling languidly into the desert. His whistle floating through the air around me as he dipped beyond the horizon.

I didn’t even have it in me to cry any longer. It was as if my very soul had been ripped from my body. My eyes drifted upwards to the darkened sky, strips of orange cutting through the gray blanketing clouds, the final screams of my entire world still echoing in my ears.

A crow cawed while watching from the railing of the porch, illuminated orange from the flames engulfing the entire house.

I let my eyes fall closed. And I placed the barrel of the pistol to my chin…",2,1763117816.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Quick question, I am currently trying to sort my life out. I have lost a lot of weight in the past and due to some personal life issues and generally lake of self care, I sky rocketed up to my highest yet almost **22 Stone (308lbs)**. Over the last 5-6 Months I have been trying to slowly and in a maintainable way. I track all of my food because I always underestimate calories so I track absolutely everything. From Sauces to sugars in my coffee. I have chosen to focus on my life style change by becoming sober. I haven't drank any alcohol since Feb and I haven't smokes anything for 6 and a half months. I went from struggling to walk to being able to run a 10k (Although not quickly).

I am down to **18stone 4.6** and for the last two weeks that is exactly where I have stayed. I have dropped down to 18st 3.4 but then pop back up to **18st 4.6lbs**. I have tried to stay focused and lock in on my work outs and on my diet but it's starting to really get to me. I am becoming slightly obsessive with my tracking and weigh my ketchup/sauces bottles before and after I use them so I can get exact mesaurements. I am weighing my self every day to try and see how the scale moves and if maybe the day I weigh myself is just a day I fluxiate due to my meal plan but I just seem to be stuck at this weight.

Any advice would be great. Should I just trust the process and try and focus on keeping it up until my body starts loosing again or am I doing something wrong? 

I have a long way to go before I am at my goal weight and I am starting to really struggle with self doubt.

Everyone keeps talking about smart bulbs and smart plugs like they're basically the same thing. But after using both for a few months, I realized they're actually pretty different, and understanding what makes them unique helped me figure out which ones I actually needed.

**Smart Bulbs: Light Control Only**

Smart bulbs are basically just light bulbs with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth built in. You screw them into your regular lamp or ceiling fixture, and boom – now you can control them with your phone or voice commands. The main thing they do is change colors, dim the lights, or turn on and off remotely.

They're cool for setting moods or scheduling your bedroom light to wake you up gradually. But here's the catch – they only work with lighting. You can't use them for anything else.

**Smart Plugs: Control Literally Anything**

This is where smart plugs really shine. A smart plug sits between your wall outlet and whatever device you want to control. Coffee maker? Plug it in. Space heater? Sure. That old fan in your garage? Absolutely.

The beauty of smart plugs is their flexibility. I use mine for my coffee maker so it starts brewing before I wake up, and I've got another one on a lamp that turns on automatically when it gets dark. My friend even uses one for his aquarium filter to keep it on a schedule.

**The Real Difference**

Smart bulbs are specialized for lighting control with features like color changing and dimming. Smart plugs are general-purpose power controllers that work with pretty much any electronic device.

Cost-wise, smart plugs usually win. You can get a decent smart plug for way less than most smart bulbs, and you're not limited to just controlling lights. Plus, if a regular bulb burns out in your smart plug setup, you just replace it with any cheap bulb. With smart bulbs, you're replacing the whole expensive unit.

**Energy monitoring** is another thing some smart plugs offer. You can actually see how much electricity your devices are using, which is pretty neat if you're trying to lower your power bill.

**Which One Should You Get?**

Honestly? It depends on what you need. If you want fancy color-changing lights for your gaming setup or bedroom, get smart bulbs. But if you want to automate regular appliances and devices around your house, smart plugs are the way to go.

I personally think most people should start with smart plugs because they're more versatile. You can automate your entire house without replacing every single light bulb.

At the end of the day, smart home automation doesn't have to be complicated or expensive. Figure out what you actually want to control, and pick the right tool for the job.",1,1763117441.0,stuffyouneeddaily,0,1.0,False

I have this freakish obsession with optimization, i need to maximize the output i get from this medication cus its pretty damn expensive and also its more fun for me to think this way. 

I wanted to know how others take their medication, compare it with mine and list out all the effects to conclude with the best way my body reacts. 

**Background:**

I'm 19, been taking 20 mg of methylphenidate (prolonged release) neaarly every day for about 3-4 months now. It's been great, obviously the first month was the best, i felt unstoppable and free. Now that it's been a while and I actually need to put in the effort to be productive, I wanted to figure out the best time to take the medication.

* I was told to take it on a heavy stomach, after breakfast. But i find that the effectiveness runs off over the course of the day. 
* Taking it in the afternoon, when i'm about to sit to study works great but it also kinda makes me nauseous for some reason. 
* Its also AMAZINGLY effective when i take right when i start panicking over plans, it calms me down and with a little meditation, i feel so .... normal??? idk. ( I have that issue where having a plan renders me absolutely useless, all i can do is wait for the thing to happen)
* BAD WITH CAFFIENE! NEVER TAKE WITH COFFEE/ENERGY DRINK under no circumstances. its like indigestion mixed with what I imagine menopause is like. Horrendous. Black tea is a great alternative, but for me, I just need to sip on something constantly.
* do not take it at night unless you want to be up till sunrise. 

  
**Conclusion:**

  
Tell me what you do, I want to try them out (if feasible)

1owt8d2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1owt8d2,Our 4 day escape to Bhimtal ❤️,"
After 13 days in Lucknow's food coma, we decided to escape to the mountains. 

We prefer slow travel whenever possible, so here, we took 2 stops before reaching Kasar Devi.

This thread about our 1st stop; finding peace away from the 'main' spots.

An overnight train whisked us to Kathgodam, the gateway to Uttarakhand. Our final goal was Kasar Devi, but we believe travel is in the pauses. So we intentionally slowed the pace and planned two stops.

This is a thread about the first stop, Bhimtal, which turned into a 4-day workation of mountain quiet, hidden trails, and the best apple pie we’ve ever had.

The Perfect Workation Lifestyle :)

We booked a cozy Airbnb high above the main town. The views were incredible, and it was perfectly set up for a slow-travel workation. 

Most days were a blissful routine: working from our quiet base, taking long morning and evening walks, and discovering sunrise and sunset spots in the forest with absolutely no crowd. It was pure solitude.

We'd sometimes cook our meals, listening to the sounds of the birds and our favorite music. But on one day, we decided to explore two truly offbeat places and they were amazing!

Ditching the Crowds for Clearest Lake!

Tired of the usual crowded tourist boat rides, we decided to explore a new lake. This led us to Garur Lake (part of Sattal), a local secret tucked within the forest and hills. The walk to the lake felt so enchanting!
And what we found shocked us: the water was the clearest we had ever seen in an Indian lake. 🤯

For a couple of hours, we sat by the shore as it grew dark, enjoying the view with literally no one else in sight. It was just us, the wind whistling through the forest, and the gentle sounds of nature. This is what slow travel is all about.

The Temple and Its Storytellers 😊

Our second offbeat find was a tiny, peaceful Hanuman Temple, recommended by a friend. It doesn’t attract big crowds, so it was incredibly serene. We stayed until the sunset, and the views were insane.

The priests were humble storytellers, sharing local tales and legends that made the visit feel deeply personal. A moment of true peace and insight away from the usual tourist chatter.

Our Favorite Cafe Anchor 😁

A good trip requires a great base and better food. Our cafe anchor in Bhimtal remains 'iHeart Cafe.' ❤️

We had visited this cafe multiple times in our ealier trips to Bhimtal as well and it still is our comfort place! 

We enjoy their coffee, steamed momos, pizza, and their legendary dessert: the epic Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice-cream and moist Lemon Cake. This place simply never disappoints.

The Culinary Neighbors!

The food scene around iHeart Cafe is strong!

☕️ Chai etc.: Right next door, serving amazing local tea and the perfect fluffy Bun Makkhan. Don't skip it.

🍴 Let Me Dine: Across the street. We had decent pizza and tandoori fish. Service was slow, but the staff was courteous.

🌟 Zooby's: A fantastic find nearby! Excellent cold coffee, delicious Malai Kebabs, and perfectly done French Toast. A solid win.

Where To Next?

Four days of working, walking, clear-water discovery, and indulging in hill-station comfort food felt like a complete reset.We bid adieu to Bhimtal, knowing there are still a few more corners to explore next time. 

Our journey continued deeper into Uttarakhand, towards the next hidden gem before reaching Kasar Devi. (Stay tuned for the next stop!)",2,1763117097.0,DoBaniye,0,0.76,False

It's just feels so good, and the strange thing is now I don't even crave sugar anymore. At first, it was hell, but I managed successfully.

1owt4mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1owt4mb/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

 I prefer personal places like I love books so I'd rather have a man take me to a small or mid book cafe or restaurants with books (there r tons of them as i live in a metro politan city)

 I want proper places to dine at but not necessarily expensive but thoughtful and personal.

1owt1zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Uganda/comments/1owt1zr/why_more_senior_travellers_are_choosing_uganda/,"Why More Senior Travellers Are Choosing Uganda for a Slow, Life-Changing Africa Trip","There’s a growing trend among senior travellers who want something more profound than a typical safari. Not rushed tours. Not crowded hotspots. But slow, meaningful travel that mixes soft adventure, culture, community, and nature. Uganda might be one of the best places in Africa for that kind of trip, especially if you are thinking of spending 2–3 weeks and want a journey that unfolds gently.

**Uganda is becoming a favourite for older travellers:**

Adventure can be soft, like Uganda's senior-friendly gorilla and chimpanzee trekking. Rangers, porters, and guides make the experience accessible and supportive. Many travellers in their 60s and 70s describe meeting the mountain gorillas as one of the most emotional moments of their lives. It’s an adventure without chaos.

**Real Community Encounters (Not Staged for Tourists)**

Uganda does culture incredibly well because it’s genuine. What you can do: stay in a warm, comfortable homestay, visit local farms, learn traditional cooking, talk with elders, understand how communities live and work, and remember that nothing is forced or artificial. It is human-to-human travel.

**Wildlife Without Exhausting Drives:** Uganda is ideal for seniors who want to see animals without long, bumpy days.

How it is done: relaxing boat safaris, short game drives, smaller parks, fewer crowds, varied landscapes (savannah, forest, lakes). It is wildlife at a comfortable pace.

**Nature That Actually Heals Your Mind**

From crater lakes to rolling hills to quiet forests, Uganda is visually stunning in a very peaceful way. It is the perfect destination if you want something restorative, not just exciting.

**Comfortable Lodges, Big Warm Hospitality**

Uganda has excellent mid-range and upscale lodges with private cottages, great food, beautiful views, friendly people, and options for slower schedules.

**In 21 days, you can combine:**

* Gorilla trekking
* Chimpanzee trekking
* Wildlife safaris
* Village homestays
* Coffee & banana farm visits
* Relaxing lake stays
* Short, scenic hikes
* Cultural encounters
* Time to breathe.",6,1763116450.0,Uganda,0,0.88,False
