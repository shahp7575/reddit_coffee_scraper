1jm1joq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jm1joq,Kitchen Layout Advice,"Moved into a new home last year and now planning a kitchen remodel.  Previous owner had partially removed the wall between the kitchen and adjacent room in the house.  This leaves our current kitchen with very little prep or cabinet space.  Our idea for the remodel is to remove the rest of the wall and combine the two rooms into one big kitchen.
My wife and I love to cook and to entertain so a range hood, plenty of prep space, and in kitchen seating area are all must-haves.

Challenge is…the rooms are slightly offset, creating some weird angles and clearance to cabs/countertops. We don’t want to close off either doorway to the office or the dining room, since both connect to the front of the house and provide a good circulation throughout. I’ve played around with L shape, U shape, peninsulas, islands etc and this is the one we liked best. Included photos of three layouts which shift appliances around and give different feels to the work triangle. 

I’d like some feedback on:
1. Does the layout as a whole make sense? If not, how would you set this up differently?
2. If it does makes sense, what’s your favorite between A,B,C?

Any advice is appreciated! Also, I apologize in advance for the somewhat sloppy drawings. I’m just sketching in CAD in my limited free time.",1,1743185465.0,kitchenremodel,0,1.0,False

Get a reliable and stable network connection to all your gadgets. Check through my NCLEX storyline. 
Picture this..... Me, buried over a mountain of flashcards, sipping iced coffee for the long nights, and a playlist of motivational jams on repeat.... But do I say LoL 🤣..... It was 2 a.m., and my brain was begging for a break however, I ignored ...... Guess what... my heart? It was all in.....  This was my NCLEX journey,,,, a wild ride of ups and downs from study days and nights to FINALLY slipping into those beautiful, and dreamy scrubs.... (Should I continue???). 

Throughout my childhood, I had a dream and passion towards helping people,,,, making a difference, being the nurse who could light up clients faces with a smile...... But between me and that stethoscope was the NCLEX, the beast of a test that stood between me and my future 😂..... I won’t lie.... there were moments I doubted myself. The endless practice questions, the anatomy charts plastered on my walls, the panic when I blanked on the difference between hypo- and hyperkalemia (spoiler: potassium’s a tricky one!)... (You can name them). 
Later it was Magical: the little wins. Nailing tough pharma questions. Teaching my study group a trick to remember cranial nerves..... (We all have different choruses 😅😂). Watching my Naxlex practice scores climb from 50s to ‘heck yes!’.... Over 70s.  I leaned on my people.... My family who brought me snacks, my friends who quizzed me over Zoom, and even my cat, who judged my highlighter obsession but never left my side.......

TEST DAY? A blur of nerves and deep breaths. I walked into that room like I was stepping into my destiny,,, Pearson Vue centers are defeaning Quite..... I could hear a pin drop. I was ushered in the room, did the necessary security checks, and later logged into my computer . I clicked through each question with a mix of terror and grit, and hit ‘submit’ with sweaty palms.... Indeed it was rough and tough. Went and and on upto 86th question. The computer went off and I thought it was power black out. Yesss it shut at 86. 

Moments of waiting for results came, from hrs to 72hrs....Hours of restlessness and anxiety. Three days later, I received an email from the NYBON.....  When I saw the congratulations PASSED..., I couldn't hold it any further 😭😭😭.... I ugly-cried right there—years of late nights, sacrifices, and sheer stubbornness paid off at long last.... 

Now, here I am in my scrubs, charting patients instead of study schedules. Every beep of a monitor reminds me: I made it. From those chaotic study days and nights to this—my NCLEX journey wasn’t just about passing a test. It was about becoming the nurse I always knew I could be. 💉✨ #NCLEXJourney #NurseLife #DreamsInScrubs""

1jm1i1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jm1i1e/pietro_pro_grind_inconsistency/,Pietro Pro Grind Inconsistency?,"Hi all,

Just got my first Pietro grinder, Pro version with the filter-only M-Modal burrs.

  
I've been dialing-in coffees all morning, trying grinds from 6.3 - 8 since that seems to be the recommended range. I've noticed that the grinds are very inconsistent in size, especially as it gets coarser. While coarser grinds are usually less unimodal by nature, I'm surprised that I'm seeing noticeable boulders and fines at 7.1 - 7.3. I would've assumed that this would still be in the medium to medium-fine range, but it seems like it's just boulders and fines. My other grinders are the ZP6 and the Timemore 078, both which have produced noticeably more unimodal grinds.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Is it a matter of seasoning the burrs, or am I doing something wrong? One thing I've noticed is that due to the forces exerted during grinding, the rotating arm can make the burr carrier move horizontally a bit. Not sure if this hypothetically can make the burr gap move around instead of being fixed.

Any insights welcome, thanks!",1,1743185345.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

He's moderately attractive and tall, but according to my friends and acquaintances, he's a 'red flag' – untrustworthy and constantly pursuing women, often facing rejection.

I first noticed him in March 2024 and was immediately drawn to him. He seemed aware of my affection, but we didn't have any mutual connections until a friend of mine, who was in the same student club as him, introduced us. He approached my friend, and they started hanging out. One day, my friend invited me to a club event, where he deliberately sat in front of me, though we didn't speak. We weren't invited to the after-party, and I later learned he'd tried to flirt with another girl and been rejected again.

I followed him on Instagram, but when I realized he was still pursuing other women, I unfollowed him. Months later, still obsessed, I decided to be direct. When my friend and he were talking, I approached and officially introduced myself. He was kind and engaging during our brief conversations, which happened twice. Then, one night, I got drunk and went to their club's party. He seemed excited, we danced and talked all night, and he begged his friend to drive me home,his friend rejected bcz it was a long way. After that, without my knowledge, my friend invited him to our New Year's plans. We spent the night as a group, and he and I cuddled for hours.

After that night, he didn't initiate contact until I did, during our finals. After finals, I invited him for drinks with our friends, and he agreed but said he had one more exam. He then immediately asked me on a coffee date. We had our first date, and he planned the next one during it. Before the first date, he texted me, suggesting a hookup, which I declined because I wanted something more meaningful. We went on the date anyway, and I expressed my feelings, explaining that I thought he preferred blonde girls, and I was brunette. He replied, 'Why would I be here if I didn't think you were pretty?' I told him I wanted a serious relationship but would consider a fb thing if I didn't find anyone else. He jokingly said he might be busy with another woman, but I know he struggles to get one. Both dates lasted three hours, we enjoyed each others pov on life and we hugged at the end. Now, I'm confused and believe we're just friends, as he only greets me in group settings.

Hey MaximizeMe fam,

Ever find yourself squinting at your alarm with the kind of resentment usually reserved for cockroaches and slow Wi-Fi? 😴💻 We've all been there. But have you ever wondered if waking up at the crack of dawn could turn you into a high-achieving, super-productive wizard? 🧙‍♂️

We've all heard about the mystical *5AM Club*, where successful folks supposedly chisel out their greatness while the rest of us are dreaming about flying (or maybe snagging that elusive parking spot). But before you set your alarm for an ungodly hour, let's unpack this concept.

**Here's what some morning routines look like in the high-achiever world:**

- **The Athlete's Charge**: Jumping out of bed with energy that could power a small country, these folks hit the gym first thing. 🚴 No email scrolling, no candy crush—just pure, unadulterated endorphins.

- **The Zen Master's Way**: Some prefer starting with a gentle yoga flow or meditation. 🧘‍♀️ This isn’t just about flexibility; it’s about a mindset reset. Can you imagine finding peace before coffee? Magic.

- **The Brainiac's Session**: Then there’s the early risers who dive into reading or learning something new while it's still quiet. 📚 Imagine absorbing knowledge when your brain isn't yet cluttered with the day's to-do list.

- **The Creative Burst**: For the aspiring writers, painters, or musicians, the early hours could mean uninterrupted creative time. 🎨 No emails, just pure artistry.

But let’s get real for a second. Some of us just aren’t wired to leap out of bed before sunrise, and that’s totally fine. Night owls, you have your groove, too. Your midnight inspiration might be someone else's 5AM enlightenment!

**Here’s what matters at the end of the day (or beginning, in this case):**

- **Authenticity**: Your routine should feel right *for you*, not forced. Imitating someone else's success formula might lead to exhaustion instead of exclusivity.

- **Flexibility**: Have room to shuffle things around. Oversleep? That’s okay—shuffle your priorities, not your self-worth.

- **Balance**: If an early start means missing out on late-night activities that bring you joy, it's worth re-evaluating. Life is about moments, not just productivity.

So, how about it, MaximizeMe squad? How do your mornings measure up? Is the 5AM Club the elusive elixir of efficiency, or are we all just chasing another trend?

I put weight at the top since I prefer a light one (since sometimes, I will bring it to the library or coffee shop to work), but if the other performs better, I don't mind bringing even a 4 kg pack on my back. 

The TUF version with 4060 is out of stock in my local shop, so 4070 is what they have. Is it worth it?

Also, is a 14-inch laptop too small for working (coding) and gaming? I will connect it to external screen anyway but as I said, there will be sometimes I bring it outside. Also all 14-inch laptops only have 4060 version. 

Should I get Razer Blade instead? There are no official distributors in my local so warranty is a nope. If it gets sick or being damaged, I'm done.

1jm1d8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/pwnhub/comments/1jm1d8z/new_coffeeloader_malware_evades_detection_with/,New CoffeeLoader Malware Evades Detection with Sophisticated Techniques,"
**A new malware named CoffeeLoader is using advanced methods to evade detection by endpoint security software.**

**Key Points:**

- CoffeeLoader employs a unique GPU-based packer that complicates malware analysis.
- It uses techniques like call stack spoofing and sleep obfuscation to bypass security measures.
- The malware has a fallback mechanism using domain generation algorithms to maintain communication with C2 servers.

Cybersecurity experts have raised alarms about a newly discovered malware known as CoffeeLoader. This sophisticated malware can download and execute secondary payloads while successfully evading detection from both antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems. Developed around September 2024, it utilizes a specialized packer dubbed Armoury, which takes advantage of a system's GPU to obfuscate its operations. This innovation mirrors aspects of a known malware loader, SmokeLoader, indicating a concerning evolution in malware capabilities.

The infection process begins with a dropper that facilitates the execution of a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) payload using elevated privileges. CoffeeLoader’s creators have implemented several evasion techniques, such as call stack spoofing—where the malware disguises its function calls—and sleep obfuscation, which conceals its payload during inactive periods. Such tactics significantly complicate detection efforts, making it crucial for cybersecurity teams to remain vigilant against evolving threats. Notably, CoffeeLoader also employs domain generation algorithms to maintain communication with its command-and-control servers, ensuring persistence even if primary channels are disrupted.

How can organizations better defend against sophisticated malware like CoffeeLoader?

I love music, mostly into 80’s and 90’s and I’d love to hear your recommendation and will do the same if you want. I love languages, specifically I am in love with Turkish language but no I can’t talk or write in Turkish. I am totally non judgmental so you can vent.

Hot showers, endless food, instant gratification. But what if the key to unlocking raw mental strength lies in discomfort?

Two of the most powerful yet underrated tools for mental resilience are cold showers and fasting. They push your body and mind beyond their comfort zones, forcing them to adapt, grow, and become unbreakable.

Bring Back OUR Sonics.,"Good afternoon, and Happy Opening Day r/Seattle! Welcome to Soundside Chats; a weekly series about the state of Seattle, and a policy discussion about how to solve the issues that exist. If you haven't recognized me yet, my name is Thaddeus Whelan, and [I'm running for Mayor of Seattle!] (https://www.thadformayor.com) Because I'm not tethered to press releases or article publishing, I want to voice my goals directly to you. Today's discussion: Professional Sports Nationalization.

# *""Hold up, A Mayoral Candidate Shouldn't Care About Sports! Fix My Roads First.""*

I understand the sentiment here, but I'd like to try and explain why this is something we should all care about. Professional sports leagues are some of the most culturally significant pieces of America in the 21st century. National broadcasting and the monetization structure within these areas has led to an international boom and is one of the greatest unifiers both within and across borders. [Two-thirds of Seattle residents follow at least one sport](https://iir.gmu.edu/sports-and-civic-engagement/athletes-and-engagement/sports-fans-in-the-seattle-metropolitan-area), and that is partly due to how EASY it actually is to go to a game. The Light Rail has become the great train to baseball, football (of both types), and the Monorail is a good connector to go to a Kraken or Storm game. (and hopefully a Supersonics game in the near future!) SPD is paid to direct and regulate traffic during these times, and all of our facilities are tested, whether it be businesses selling/catering to fans, or our basic utilities like City Light and Waste Management to ensure everything runs smoothly.

This is all to say; Sports are a city-wide event, and even if you don't care about the specific game, the stress it puts on the city is the very same concerns that get you to work.

#Under This Topcoat, a Volatile Storm Brews

Currently, as profits and international views are skyrocketing, we are seeing more and more ownerships in the country focused on squeezing their city's government for all they are worth. We are somewhat lucky that the city owns the stadiums our teams play in, as we have seen everywhere from [Philly](https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-sixers-arena-center-city-south-philly/), to [D.C.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/capitals-wizards-move-virginia-arena-deal/), to [Oakland](https://www.bleedcubbieblue.com/2024/9/11/24241897/athletics-move-sacramento-turf-scott-boras-playoffs), to [Arizona](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-coyotes-no-more-nhl-team-moving-to-utah-following-speculation-over-future), it is seemingly a race to the bottom for who will throw a billionaire more money and tax breaks.

Sometimes not even full support from the city is enough, as we are well aware of the Supersonics travesty. The city of Seattle lost out on the opportunity to be a part of THREE MVP's careers and one of the most talented rosters of the early 2010's. All because a billionaire wanted to squeeze out some extra tax breaks and profit. I feel no malice towards Oklahoma City, they welcomed the team and created an entirely new product, but it was at an [equal and opposite loss of a cultural backbone for the PNW.](https://komonews.com/news/local/pulse-of-seattle-poll-sonics-return-more-popular-than-seattle-mayor-bruce-harrell-kraken-nba-city-council-favorable-opinion-popularity-seattleites-pickleball-police-department)

Today, even more dire threats loom over us. The allowance of [private equity firms as ownership is slowly creeping into the leagues](https://www.firecapitalmanagement.com/fire-capital-blog-posts/the-rise-of-private-equity-in-professional-sports), and if there is anything more craven than a single billionaire and his pile of money, its a company who's sole purpose is to maximize profits. Alongside that, we see [Saudi Arabia trying to ""sportswash"" its global image by investing in teams and leagues.](https://www.playthegame.org/news/how-saudi-arabia-buys-influence-in-us-sports/) To curtail genocidal government and purely profit focused interference, we need decisive action to ensure our teams remain OUR teams.

#Its Time to Nationalize Our Teams.

We already have an insanely positive blueprint to build off of; the [Green Bay Packers.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/40525171/how-538967-owners-one-president-run-packers) They have existed as a publicly owned entity since their inception. Even with this success story, the NFL has ""banned"" similar ownership structures. Why would they do that? In my opinion, its because the Packers are focused on supporting their city, not just on profit. And even so, they are a consistently competitive team.

Now, how do we actuate this if the ownership structure is banned? [Because it isn't even legal, and it should be challenged.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316684905_NFL_v_Sherman_Act_How_the_NFL%27s_ban_on_public_ownership_violates_the_federal_antitrust_laws) On top of this, America has a wonderful tool in its back pocket that has been utilized to defend the public good before. Eminent Domain. A recognized legal doctrine that has maintained the state of sports teams as just the mere threat of the [utilization of it has made owners back down from frivolous demands.](https://www.phl-law.com/blog/2023/07/eminent-domain-as-it-related-to-sports-teams/) 

The above arguments are purely from a moralistic standing that I believe our sports culture is something that is worth defending. To the other half of the argument....

# Pro Sports are Infinitely Profitable, and That Profit Should Return to the City.

I can get into the weeds on this, but it should be understood that pro leagues already socialize profits amongst each of the teams for parity's sake, and teams are VERY RARELY ever negative in their balance sheets. On top of this, a public ownership structure would allow for the city to consider the purchasing of things like tickets and merchandise as money returning to the city, so can be considered in your taxes as such. This would turn fandom and support of a local team into not just a fun pass time, but a civic victory much like going to a museum or a play is. Just for reference; the Seattle Mariners made $200 million dollars in profit in 2023. Imagine what the city could do with this type of money to support the growth and continued fervor of our fanbase city.

# If the NBA Returns to Seattle, it Should be as a Local Public Entity.

A coffee billionaire stole our team out from under our noses, and it should not be up to the whims of a purely profit focused mind that keeps our teams in Seattle. We have some of the most fervent fans in the entire country, and [we still have ownership groups here that continue to maximize their own gains rather than let their GMs off the leash and compete at 100%.](https://www.sounderatheart.com/2024/10/latest-salary-data-illustrates-how-sounders-are-falling-behind/) We are lucky that the Kraken and Seahawks ownership groups are fans of the city and the team, but as of now that situation can flip on a dime. [Just look at Dallas, a city completely behind a phenom that had him ripped away by a GM and ownership that purchased the team two years ago and didn't get ""it"".](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/02/25/luka-doncic-lakers-trade-timeline-mavericks/80076080007/)

I refuse to allow any outside entity that just sees an ever-appreciating product to gain a foothold in our city, to predate upon our fans, suck our city dry, and then move on to the next cash cow. This is by no means a ""this will happen the day I become Mayor"" kind of ideal, but it needs to be pursued at the highest level now before the Russian Roulette that is bad ownership decisions falls on our heads again. Alongside that, we need to believe in our ability to do big things again. We, as a nation, have foregone everything from interstate rail to space travel to billionaires, and that stops now.

She’s the most negative person I know. She’s always complaining, always stressed, always angry and screaming, no matter how small or ridiculous the problem is. It feels like I’m constantly walking on eggshells around her. I can never fully relax when she’s around. Even if she’s in a good mood, I still feel tense waiting for something to set her off.

She complains about everything literally everything. Once I counted, and in less than 10 minutes, she had complained about 20 different things. I can’t stand negative people, it’s so draining 😭. 

The worst part is, we do almost everything together. We even share a car, so avoiding her is difficult. If I needed the car and she has an errand later, even if she has plenty of time she would get so anxious and would rush me and call me multiple times to check if Ill be back in time. Sometimes angry sometimes not but even if she wasn’t angry, the stress she carries gets to me and suddenly something that should be simple becomes so overwhelming.

Activities as simple as grabbing coffee with her is so stressful because she’s always rude towards staff too. I feel like no matter how I write this it won’t fully capture how stressful this actually is. You have to experience a negative person to understand :( 

Before anyone says I should move out, I come from a culture where that’s not the norm so it’s not an option. I do try to limit how much time I spend with her but to be honest I think what’s draining me even more is that I don’t have friends. If I had a friend group where I could unwind and actually enjoy my time my mental health would probably be a lot better. But that’s a whole other issue I’m dealing with.

If your income is below $2159/month, you qualify for free food-money from the USDA. The static amount for a single adult currently sits at $240/m and this applies to most edible objects, including coffee and spices.

Recently, Robert F. Kennedy Jr's campaign to ""Make America Healthy Again"" included calls to remove high-sugar sodas from the eligible products covered by SNAP. Despite RFK being the head of HHS, the decision is ultimately up to the USDA which prefers a more vague, corporate-favored eligibility, only excluding things like alcohol, tobacco, or hot prepared meals., or service, such as fast-food.

Soda accounts for about 5% of SNAP purchases, and Coca-Cola recently claimed that SNAP accounted for 25% of their sales. If the focus is on high fructose corn syrup, then Redbull, Monster, and Rockstar are all on the chopping block.

My father was diagnosed with advanced cancer about six weeks ago, and it's been especially difficult because I live in a different country from him. The distance makes me feel helpless, and I've been dealing with a lot of loneliness and depression.

What's making this harder is that I have two close friends and my brother who live in the same city as me, but I feel like I'm not getting the support I expected from them. They know about my situation, and while they do text me once a week to check in, none of them have suggested meeting up for coffee or drinks, which is something I desperately need right now.

I have even tried proposing with each or as a group that we get together for dinner or drinks several times over the past month as a way to distract myself and get some social interaction, but they've consistently said they're busy with their children. I've even offered to meet them at places convenient for them, like cafes or pubs 5 mins from where they live, but I just get occasional check-in texts instead of actual plans.

For context, I don't have children myself, and we're all in our late 30s. I'm wondering if I'm being unreasonable or if I just can't understand their perspective as parents.

1jm0x0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1jm0x0s/ltns_lowtraffic_neighbourhoods_a_summary_of_some/,LTNs (low-traffic neighbourhoods): a summary of some studies available and of the main points raised by supporters and opponents,"There have been a few posts on LTNs (low-traffic neighbourhoods), but none mentioning some crucial pieces of information on how many LTNs have been created, how many scrapped, what has and what hasn't been studied.

 

I report them here, trying my best to distinguish between facts and opinions.

You are entitled to your own opinions but not to your own facts, and you cannot have an informed opinion if you don't have all the facts.

 

*TLDR:*

*There is no study which looks at what makes an LTN work or fail, what to do, what to avoid.*

*My personal opinion is that an LTN can work if it closes secondary roads, but not if it closes distributor roads (like in Streatham, see below) , i.e. roads which are not quiet cul-de-sacs but are important arteries for the free-flowing of vehicles in a city, and not if it isn't accompanied by an improvement in public transport (e.g. we close a road but we improve the bus service, add a bus lane, etc.)*



\---------------------------------------------------------

**FACT**: 96 LTNs were introduce in London during the Covid period. 

Source: Aldred's Jan-2023 study, page 7: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Nsm\_GFdH6CpIpPpOZ7hbhLZScgqCAP7ZGI0xi4qDqA/edit?tab=t.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Nsm_GFdH6CpIpPpOZ7hbhLZScgqCAP7ZGI0xi4qDqA/edit?tab=t.0)

 **FACT**: One of the most comprehensive studies of London's LTNs is Aldred's (see above). It studies only 46 out of the 96 LTNs, i.e. circa half.

 

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN opponents criticise the study, because they say it is textbook selection bias to exclude the schemes which were scrapped (most would have been scrapped because they weren't working). Those excluded include the schemes scrapped from Wandsworth and Ealing because they were very unpopular with residents.
* LTN supporters claim that there is no bad faith and that you cannot study that for which there is no data.



\---------------------------------------------------------

**FACT**: Aldred's study shows that traffic went up in 54% of central London LTNs, 50% of inner London LTNs, and 62% of outer London LTNs. Source: same link, table 9, page 54

 

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN opponents think this shows LTNs don't work: the LTNs which were scrapped because they weren't working are excluded from the study, and, even focusing on the LTNs which have maybe kind of worked, traffic still went up in 50 to 62% of boundary roads. They say that the entire premise was to make traffic evaporate everywhere, but this didn't happen. They say that, if we included data on the LTNs scrapped and excluded from the study, we'd see that traffic went up in the majority of boundary roads.
* LTN supporters say there is no bad faith and no selection bias, and view it as a positive that traffic goes up in only ca. half the boundary roads.

\---------------------------------------------------------

**FACT**: To my knowledge there is no study which analyses what makes an LTN work or fail, what to do, what to avoid.

 

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN opponents say that this proves the bad faith of LTN supporters, who like to think that an LTN can work anywhere.
* LTN supporters say that the success of an LTN depends on people's willingness to give up their cars.

 \---------------------------------------------------------

**FACT**: all these studies use traffic counters which the manufacturers recommend be used for free-flowing, not slow moving traffic

 

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN opponents say that these traffic counters are not fit for purpose and are underestimating the true increase in traffic
* LTN supporters say that the traffic counters work well even if they weren't initially conceived for slow-moving traffic

\---------------------------------------------------------

**FACT**: The Streatham LTN in London's Lambeth borough was scrapped because of significant delays and cancellation on bus routes.  BBC article: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68511760#:\~:text=A%20south%20London%20council%20is,bus%20services%22%20on%20the%20A23](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-68511760#:~:text=A%20south%20London%20council%20is,bus%20services%22%20on%20the%20A23).

 

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN supporters think that the delays were caused only the roadworks, and that with no roadworks the LTN would have worked
* LTN opponents point out that the Streatham LTN included a distributor road (Valley road). They say that an LTN can work when it closes a quiet, secondary back road, but not when it impacts a distributor road, and that therefore the impact on the bus service would have been similar even without the roadworks. A definition can be found on Camden's website: [https://www3.camden.gov.uk/planning/plan/udp/Appendix%207.pdf](https://www3.camden.gov.uk/planning/plan/udp/Appendix%207.pdf)

\--------------------------------------------------------

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN supporters say we need LTNs because sat navs have caused an increase in traffic on residential roads.
* LTN opponents point out that ALL roads in London (at least in inner London) are residential, and that the alleged increase in traffic along back roads did not happen, it was simply a statistical error due to a flawed methodology. The Department of Transport provided an official explanation here: [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2021/minor-road-traffic-estimates-review-frequently-asked-questions](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2021/minor-road-traffic-estimates-review-frequently-asked-questions)

\-----------------------------------------------------------

**OPINIONS**:

* LTN supporters claim we need more LTNs because people drive too much.
* LTN opponents  claim that a lot of the traffic is minicabs (they have doubled in a decade), delivery vans and trades vans, i.e. vehicles which are not deterred by LTNs and by higher parking costs. They claim that in inner London parking is already hard to find and expensive, and that there cannot be many people who drive to get a coffee half a mile away.
* Some LTN supporters and opponents agree that reducing the number of minicabs would be beneficial.

 

**FACTS**:

* miles driven in London have been going down for more than 2 decades, despite an increase in population.
* The decrease is particularly significant in inner London boroughs, including boroughs outside of the congestion charge.
* Official DfT data: [https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6](https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/regions/6)
* Between 2007 and 2023 (the congestion charge was introduced in 2003), miles driven went down 19% in Hammersmith & Fulham, 15% in Lambeth, 18% in Southwark.

1jm0sr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Athens/comments/1jm0sr0/i_went_to_the_mall_redevelopment_meeting/,I went to the mall redevelopment meeting,"This is Muppet D. Disaster reporting not live for community duty. See below for notes and speculation on the mall redevelopment meeting.

  
**Meeting Summary**

Meeting was being run by District 6 Commissioner Stephanie Johnson. Meeting originally said mall food court but it was actually in the space off the food court. It was in the middle section of mall where all the bottom hallways converge. There used to be a Muslim-owned coffee shop there not too long ago. Good coffee. Anyway.

Stephanie introduced the panel at the table. There were 3 guys. Sorry I didn't catch who the third guy was. One was Brad Griffin, the recently retired director of the planning commission for the city. He now serves as interim manager of the ACC, until they find somebody else. Other guy was the co-developer who works for Leapley???, the company that currently owns the majority of the mall???? {citation needed} He proudly let us know. They own the mall OUTRIGHT and with NO DEBT.



Let me preface this by saying my gaps are NOT MY FAULT THIS TIME. The space was so damn echoey. The mics plus space were making everyone sound like we were deep in a cave spelunking and calling out to one another. I could barely understand Brad or Stephanie.



Brad spoke and said a bit of nothing. At first he wouldn't even stand up so multiple people in the crowd had to stand up and yell at him to stand up because we literally could not hear what he was saying. Then he stood up and wouldn't put the mic near his mouth so it sounded like he was transmitting through a ham radio. If anybody else was there and know what Brad said, chime in. I'm not even 30 yet and I was straining to understand what was being said. 



Then, the developer guy spoke. Developer guy was a lil condescending in my humble muppet opinion. It was like...constant repetition, constant talking down to the crowd and this like ""raise ya hand if you ever have done a TAD"" in a very That's What I Thought kinda way. Would've been better if he was a little more chill. Anyway. He repeated the acronym TAD (Tax Allocation District) at us a lot and basically just kept telling us that we don't understand all the work that goes into the project so we should stop complaining. Idk if anybody in the crowd ever complained at this guy because to my knowledge this was the first meeting of this kind? {citation needed part 2} I could be wrong though! He sounded more like he was responding to things he had been told. Again, hard to hear, but he said somebody asked him: ""What was taking so long?"". To my knowledge that person was somebody working on or around the project. So idk why he was  responding towards a crowd of Athenians and Oconeeians about it. But whatever. 



Overall, the plan sounds the same as it's always been. 



**Cliff notes of the plan:**



\- Mall is partially being torn down. Only parts staying are Belk and a piece of the mall near Belk. Some of the places in the mall will stay and my personal theories are at the bottom. My theories will use some facts and some speculation.



\-Residential housing is being built all over the property. Some of it will be ""affordable"". Definition of affordable as stated by Developer Man will be 60 percent of the AMI. I believe it says something different on the picture I'll post below. Unfortunately, also according to him, they included Oconee County people in their AMI calculation. So, it will probably still result on rather expensive apartments, monthly rent wise. This is just me theorizing a little though.



\- There will be mixed use housing. Residential and retail.



\- There will be greenspace.



\- There will be a bus transfer center.



All of these are things that were mostly known prior to the meeting. Below is a drawing that was at the meeting, showing what this project may look like.

***Theories Corner***



**Factual theories:**

   \- Visiting Angels- this one is the old people help center. It hires people to go out to old folks homes and care for them. The company has said they are staying in the mall, at least to their workers. A worker there told me this.

\-Youthforce- the TAD shown above includes allocation for Youthforce which is a center run by Boys and Girls Club. So they will stay.

\- Belk has been confirmed to stay forever because they own their piece of the building and they said you will take it over my dead, southern casualwear- covered body.

**Unfactual theories:**

\- military recruiter place will stay

\-  police station will stay

\-  shoe depot? department? corporation? will close

\-  Claire's will close

\-  Jamaican restaurant 316 will close or relocate

\-  Jack's cheesecakes will close or relocate

\-  Hibbett sports? Outta here.

\-  place that's name I don't know that sells hoverboards and child sized suvs? Outta here. 



**TLDR;** The mall redevelopment plan is still on and appears to be exactly what it's been reported to be. It may of course take longer than we expect because...development, amirite?

When we started dating, they had some alcohol issues but calmed down after a while (over drinking, getting blackout drunk most night of the week). My partner has never been violent or aggressive while drunk, but they do over drink and act insane sometimes. Last night we went out, it was the last night of vacation time we both took off together and my partner wanted to go to karaoke. I said okay, we could go have a drink do a couple songs and leave, but we were there for over 3 hours and he was drinking a lot. Finally I expressed I wanted to leave after his next song, so he puts it in and we go outside while we wait. While outside this guy was talking to my partner about how great of a singer he is and how talented he is. He made comments on how it’s good I’m supporting him and then proceeded to call me his bottom bitch. It was shrugged off but really bothered me. After my boyfriend stayed and did multiple more songs so I said I was going home if he wanted to stay he could, but I wanted to get some sleep. We got into an argument as we were walking home, about how I was frustrated that A this turned out to be a 4 hour long endeavor, and B, he didn’t acknowledge I was called his bottom bitch and I felt hurt by that. He ended up leaving our house to go back out without letting me know, stayed out until 3 am, came home absolutely blackout drunk. I told him he could sleep on the couch because it was so late and I had work and we could talk the next day. I woke up this morning to all of our shit everywhere. His cup of coffee from the previous morning was spilled all over our carpet, he broke one of our mirrors, he pushed out giant tv almost to the point of breaking, and knocked out trash over which spilled coffee grounds, old drinks, etc everywhere. I’m just really frustrated by this and want him and I to set boundaries on when we go out and how much he consumes. Every time he gets really drunk it isn’t fun for me and stuff like this happens. I’m just looking for some perspective on this!",0,1743183525.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.4,False
1jm0rrv,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jm0rrv/ms_piano_man/,[MS] Piano Man,"The early morning drive felt like an adventure, a rare moment of togetherness. The sky stretched out, endless and pale, while the early autumn wind fussed with the last of the summer leaves. Eleanor rested her hand on her belly, smiling as Daniel drummed his fingers against the steering wheel in time with the soft hum of the radio. They had found the piano on a whim- a listing on a local online marketplace. It felt like fate, the perfect addition to their home, a project to bring new life to something forgotten. ""This’ll be nice,"" Daniel had said as they pulled onto the gravel lot of the rundown motel. ""A little something for you to do, keep you busy.""

She still remembered the boy he had been when they met in college- the way he used to scribble poetry in the margins of his textbooks, how he played guitar on the campus lawn, his voice soft, earnest. Back then, he had been sweet, almost shy, the kind of man who blushed when their hands brushed while walking side by side for the first time. They had been each other’s first love, a whirlwind of shared secrets from their past and stolen kisses in dim dormitory hallways. He would show her off at parties and never miss a moment to tell her how beautiful she was. Even now, after everything, she clung to that version of him, the memory of who he had once been. Some nights, she convinced herself that that man still existed. Some nights, for her sake, she let herself believe it.

The piano sat in the neon glow of a flickering motel sign, its mahogany frame swallowed by layers of dust and time. The air inside the now-closed lobby was stale, as if the place had been holding its breath for years. Eleanor reached out, her fingers brushing over the intricate carvings- roses and twisting vines etched deep into the wood, as though the hands that shaped them had poured their soul into every curve.

The keys, long abandoned, lay beneath a film of grime, their once-pristine ivory sheen faded to a weary yellow. The bench, as detailed as the rest, with the cushion covered in moth-eaten emerald green velvet, creaked softly when she shifted her weight as she sat gently. It felt... right. Like something forgotten had suddenly been remembered.

Daniel paced beside her, his impatience like static tension in the air. The retired clerk counted out his payment in slow, deliberate movements, his tired eyes had no curiosity. He merely nodded, summoning a young man from the back to help load the piano. The teen, a bit more chipper than the man, took Eleanor’s twenty-dollar tip with a grateful, lopsided smile before disappearing back into the motel’s belly.

As soon as the truck doors clanked shut, Daniel exhaled. ""You do realize the only reason we got this damn thing was because it was cheap, right?"" His voice was hateful and sharp.

Eleanor swallowed. ""I know. I thought it was only right because–""

""Did you? Because you’re not working. You’re practically on bed rest. Money is tight, Ellie. Or does this pregnancy make you forget?""

She turned her gaze to the window, watching the tall autumn trees flash by. No answer given would be the right one.

Daniel’s fingers flexed against his thigh, a flicker of something dangerous in his movements. The silence made him angrier. Instead of striking, he punched the dashboard. ""I’m probably going to be late for work because of this.""

At home, he wheeled the piano into the corner Eleanor had already cleared, the dying morning light catching the carved roses and making them seem to bloom. He left. His parting apology was hollow, just another line in a script she’d heard before.

When the house settled into silence, Eleanor wiped away the dust, revealing the wood’s deep, rich shine. The act of cleaning it felt almost sacred, as if she were waking something long asleep. But it needed something more. A finishing touch.

Outside, the wind galloped through the field behind the house, the sunflowers toppling back and forth in a domino effect. She cut a handful, their golden faces still warm from the sun in her hands and placed them in a vintage green glass vase. When she stepped back inside, the air felt different and thick, like she was underwater even though all the windows were open.

As she walked past the threshold of the living room, a man stood near the piano.

The vase slipped from her grasp, shattering into shards that glittered on the floor between her and the man.

The man turned. His presence wasn’t alarming, no, it was familiar, like a name on the tip of her tongue. His dark green eyes held something knowing, something comforting and genuine. ""I didn’t mean to startle you.” his voice was soft and nervous. “We might need a broom,"" he said, bending to gather the broken glass 

Her heart should have been pounding. It wasn’t. ""Why are you standing in my living room? It’s there, can you get it? I do not really like turning my back on strangers in my home,” she points to the broom neatly tucked in the corner from cleaning out the area where the piano now sits.

""My name is Victor,"" he murmured as he swiftly went to grab the broom and started collecting the glittered glass. ""This was once my piano, uh, see, I carved the design myself. These are my initials.”

The way he stood beside it, his fingers ghosting over the keys, felt like the truth, and she did not need any more explanation. Eleanor felt safe. He had been waiting for her, and it seemed strangely she had been waiting for him. As the days stretched on, Victor became her solace, his lessons guiding her hands over the keys, his voice filling the hollow lonely spaces in her days. They joked and talked about their childhood and their dreams from the past and the future. 

They would sit for hours, time slipping away unnoticed, talking about the things that made them who they were. The stories of their pasts intertwined, building a connection so strong, so undeniable, that Eleanor found herself wondering what life would have been like if she had met him earlier, when she was free to love anyone she wanted.

Victor never showed himself when Daniel was home.

Eventually, the baby came. Grace. And things got worse.

The abuse grew darker and more violent. The thrown objects, once aimed at walls, began finding her instead. His rage sharpened, no longer muddled by shouts or slammed doors- he struck before she could even flinch, before she had the chance to brace for the impact. She fought back and won sometimes, but that was more exhausting.

Victor saw everything- the way Eleanor’s shoulders hunched at the sound of a car door slamming, the way she flinched at sudden and swift movements, or when the tea kettle abruptly started screaming. He said nothing. But he was always there after.

One night, Daniel became something else entirely. A snarl, a force of rage, he shook the walls and foundation. His hands closed around her wrists, his breath fiery hot and tainted with rum against her ear as he spat the ugliest words she had ever heard. He shoved her, her body colliding with objects in the room. The air in the room grew toxic and viciously charged; if someone lit a match at that moment, the house was sure to explode.

""You think I don’t see it? The hate you have for me? I see it."" His voice was raw, ragged, raspy from screaming for so long. “I got close to you at school because I wanted your friend, I never wanted you, I never wanted that fucking baby either.” He points at Grace sleeping through the shouting as if this were a part of her nightly routine, because it was. In her short experience in this world, this was her normal. Daniel got close to Eleanor's face as if he was about to give her an unwanted kiss and whispered “You ruined my life, you fucking bitch.” 

As he turned to walk towards Grace, Victor appeared from the shadowed corner of the room.

Daniel’s face drained of color. ""Who– Who-what.. what the hell–""

He stumbled back with a look of both confusion and embarrassment at being caught in his once secret act. His foot slipped on the corner of the fleece baby blanket that was laid on the polished wooden floor. The sharp whittled corner of the handmade piano bench met his skull with a sickening crack. Blood seeped onto the wooden floor, pooling, spreading, reaching towards Grace, who was fast asleep on the blanket.

Eleanor stood motionless, watching as the last breath rattled from Daniel’s lips. Her gaze drifted to Victor. He was steady, sorrowful.

Grace stirred on the floor, awoken by the sudden silence she was not used to. Her tiny face was serene despite the blood creeping closer. Eleanor lifted her daughter, pressing her warmth against her chest. The silence in the house deepened.

Her phone sat on the coffee table, she didn’t reach for it.

She exhaled.

Relief.

Victor, behind her, said nothing; she felt the weight of a hand on her shoulder. In that moment, she didn’t know if he was real or something she had conjured to survive. A friend's love to help her cope. But it didn’t matter.

She was free.

The fault was hers, yes. She had made the tincture of oleander, peace lily, and ghost hip- slipped it into his cheap bottle of rum with the quiet absolute certainty of someone who had nothing left to lose. But she never imagined it would end this way. No, never the mess of him, creeping across the floor as if he were lunging at her one more time after death in slow motion.

If Victor was a figment of her fractured mind, not something tangible in this world. Then she must've carried her dead husband to the middle of the sunflower field behind her house and buried him.",1,1743183518.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I work in the intensive care unit, where patients are in critical condition and every decision matters. One of the doctors on our team, Dr. Riley (41F), has a bad habit of disappearing during her shifts. She will either go take a nap in the on call room, take long coffee breaks or just mysteriously vanish when things get intense. The problem? She expects me and the other nurses to cover for her. At first, I didn’t say anything because, she is a doctor and I didn’t want to make waves. But it kept happening. One night, we had a code blue (meaning a patient was crashing) and I had to page her three times before she finally showed up half asleep, hair messy, clearly just woke up. By that time, we had already stabilized the patient without her.

Last week, she asked me directly to cover for her while she left the hospital for a “personal emergency.” I later found out through social media that her “emergency” was drinks with friends. That was it for me…So when she asked me again a few days ago to handle things while she “stepped out”,I flat-out said: “No, Dr. Riley If you leave, I am reporting it….” She looked shocked and tried to guilt-trip me saying, “wow, I thought we had a good working relationship. I always support you.” And I just said “patients come first” and walked away…..

Well, she DID leave and I reported her. Now, she is under investigation and she is furious. Some of the other nurses are saying I should’ve just “kept quiet” instead of potentially ruining her career…
But honestly? I don’t regret it. I am here to save lives not cover for someone who doesn’t take their job seriously.

1jm0nzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/comments/1jm0nzv/dossier_fragrances_review_12_fragrances_long/,Dossier Fragrances Review - 12 Fragrances [LONG],"so i thought i’d come on here and share my honest thoughts on 12 dossier fragrances i picked up during their recent sale. i got **amber saffron, floral pear, ambery vanilla, woody sandalwood, ambery vetiver, floral marshmallow, woody sage, powdery peach, fruity neroli, woody chestnut, fruity neroli, floral grapefruit and musky musk**, i definitely bought them with the intention of returning a few, but i was really curious about the brand. i’ve seen so many good things online — how close they are to the originals, how well they perform, how lovely they smell — so i figured it was finally time to try a bunch for myself and see what the hype was about.

honestly, it was a very mixed bag. some scents i genuinely fell in love with, and others just weren’t for me at all. for some context, i usually lean towards sweet, gourmand, vanilla-heavy perfumes, but i also enjoy a few airy, mature, or floral scents when done right. some of my favourite fragrances include **ysl mon paris, libre intense, kayali vanilla candy rock sugar, yum boujee marshmallow, vanilla 28, parfums de marly valaya, and sol de janeiro 62** — so that should give you a sense of what i usually go for.

just to be clear, i ***haven’t*** smelled most (if any) of the original fragrances these are inspired by. the purpose of this haul wasn’t to compare them to the designer versions — i can’t really speak on that. i already have a decent selection of designer perfumes and didn’t feel the need to buy dupes of them yet since I’m not running out of them anytime soon. this was more about trying new things, stepping a little out of my comfort zone, exploring new sent families and figuring out what actually works for me.

so if you’re looking for a post that breaks down how similar these are to the *originals*, this probably won’t help much. but if you want honest opinions on how they actually smell, how they wear, how accurate they are to their descriptions, and whether they’re worth buying — then keep reading!!!

fair warning: it’s **long**. i wanted to be as thorough and honest as possible — no commission-based tiktoker fluff here, just my real thoughts as someone who loves fragrance and wanted to test these properly. i will be ranking these from worst to best :)



# woody sandalwood 2/10

this is a dupe for le labo's santal 33. i had really high hopes for this scent. and i seriously tried. it’s a such crowd favourite on tiktok, and so many influencers (even the super girly ones you wouldn’t expect) call it their go-to. that really intrigued me, because i thought maybe this was the kind of deeper, woody scent i could finally get into.

unfortunately, it completely missed the mark for me. the notes sound beautiful on paper: violet leaves, cardamom, orris, ambrox, cedarwood, cypriol, musk, sandalwood, amber. but to my nose, all i could smell was *wood*. just layer after layer of straight woodiness, and nothing about it was soft or inviting. it was very dry, very sharp, and extremely headache-inducing. i even tried layering it with my sweeter fragrances but literally nothing helped.

i really tried to like it, but every time i wore it, i felt overwhelmed. it just didn’t blend well with my personal taste or body chemistry. i know a lot of people love it — and if you’re into heavy, woody profiles, it might work for you  (my boyfriend actually liked this one)—but if you're more into sweet, soft, or gourmand scents, this might not be the right fit as it was a clear no for me. 2/10



# woody sage 4/10

this is a dupe for jo malone's wood sage and sea salt. i don’t hate this fragrance, but i don’t particularly like it either. it leans too earthy and woody for my personal taste, which i kind of expected — i’ve been trying to ease myself into more woody scents, but i’m realising they’re just not really my thing.

i started with woody sandalwood, which i absolutely hated — it gave me a headache and was way too heavy. so i thought woody sage might be a milder introduction to that family, and it is. it’s definitely more toned down and wearable, but even then, it’s still not something i see myself reaching for on its own.

it has a very literal scent profile — it smells like a mix between a forest and salty sea air, which is actually kind of cool. i can see how someone else would love this. and i will say, when i layer it with sweeter fragrances like vanilla or floral marshmallow, it actually adds some really nice depth and balance. so in that way, i don’t mind having it.

but on its own, it’s not something i enjoy enough to wear. the marine salt, fig tree, grapefruit, clary sage, and amberwood all come through clearly, and now that i’ve smelled it, i can confidently say this scent profile just isn’t for me. apparently it smells identical to the original, so if that’s your vibe, you’ll probably love this — but for me, it’s a pass. 4/10



# woody chestnut: 5/10 for layering: 8/10

this one was tough for me. woody chestnut is inspired by maison margiela’s by the fireplace, and i really, really wanted to love it. the description had me sold — cozy, crackling fire, warm cabin vibes — it sounds like something i’d be obsessed with. and to be fair, when you smell it, it really does live up to that description. it smells exactly like what it’s meant to.

but this was another case of me thinking i’d like a scent profile, only to realise it’s just not for me. apparently there’s vanilla in the base, which i was hoping would come through a bit more to add sweetness. while it does make the scent feel slightly creamier, it doesn’t shift the overall tone — it still leans very smoky and wody, and not in a way i personally enjoy. i don’t hate it, but i also don’t love it, and i would never wear this on its own. 

*but with that being said*, it’s absolutely ***FANTASTIC***  as a layering scent. paired with something like kayali vanilla 28, it transforms into this warm, cozy, slightly sensual winter dream. it adds a beautiful depth and richness to sweeter fragrances, and for that reason, i’m actually really happy to have it in my collection. as a standalone fragrance, i’d rate it a 5/10. but as a layering fragrance, especially for the colder months, it easily jumps to an 8. i can’t wait to pull it out in winter and mix it with my favorites!

# floral pear 5/10

i had high hopes for this one. i kept seeing people describe it as the perfect clean girl scent, and that’s exactly what i was going for. and to be fair, it *is* clean — very fresh, very light. but to me, it leans too far into that soapy territory. it doesn’t open up in a bright or fruity way like i expected. instead, it smells almost like a high-end bar of soap, which isn’t bad, but not something i personally want to wear.

in terms of the notes, i mostly got the pear right away, and a little bit of freesia. on the dry down, there’s a hint of musk, but i could barely detect any amber at all. again, i don’t even dislike this fragrance — i just *wanted* to like it more. the overly soapy quality is what’s holding it back from being great in my opinion.

i haven’t tried the original english pear & freesia by jo malone, so i can’t say how close it is to that. i considered keeping it, but deep down i knew i wouldn’t reach for it over other scents i actually enjoy. it’s nice in theory, just not something that fits my style. 5/10



# powdery peach 6/10

this one is honestly a toss-up for me. it's inspired by jimmy choo i want choo and if it performs better and is more intense than powdery peach, i might have to get it. i have such a love-hate relationship with this perfume. i’ve seen people online say it’s super strong, and even on the website it’s listed as a statement scent, but that wasn’t my experience at all. i found it to be really light — sometimes i could barely smell it on my skin even after an hour.

it performs a little better on clothes, and there have been times where i’ve caught a soft whiff and thought “wait, what’s that?” only to realise it was powdery peach. but overall, i don’t find it to be intense or long-lasting. i don’t really get how it’s marketed as statement on their website’s scent intensity scale when it feels so subtle.

as for the scent itself, it’s very airy and citrusy with just the slightest hint of sweetness. it’s not too sharp or tangy like some citrus perfumes, which i actually appreciate. there’s a softness to it, the vanilla is barely there but gives it a touch of warmth and sweetness, while the blackcurrant and tangerine come through more clearly than the actual peach, which was i wasn’t expecting since i was hoping for something more peach-forward.

i actually really really like the smell of this fragrance, but its performance and longevity just lets it down for me. I don’t know if it’s a case of I need to let it macerate for awhile before the intenseness really comes out, but as is, it’s a bit lighter than I would like, it’s also really powdery too which I guess is reflected in the name.

i really wanted to love this because i usually enjoy peach scents, but this just didn’t quite land for me. it’s not bad at all — i’d probably give it a 6.5 out of 10 — but it didn’t leave much of an impression, and i’m not sure i’d reach for it often. 



# ambery vetiver 6.75/10

i definitely wasn’t expecting this to smell the way it does, but honestly, i mean that in a good way. it’s fresh, citrusy, and clean — exactly what it claims to be. it reminds me of an expensive hotel spa in the best way, and there’s something really calm and polished about it.

this isn’t usually my go-to scent profile since i tend to lean more toward deep, sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially anything with vanilla or warm notes. but i’ve been trying to branch out and try new things, and this one has been growing on me more and more each day.

i’m really picking up all the notes in this — the bergamot, lemon, and buchu up top give it that fresh, citrusy feel, while the orange blossom, marigold, and violet in the heart add some softness and complexity. the base of vetiver, amber, and cedarwood gives it just enough warmth and depth. even the cedarwood, which can sometimes be too much for me, is really subtle here, and that’s a good thing.

it’s inspired by byredo’s bal d’afrique, and i can absolutely see why this would be a go-to or everyday scent for a lot of people. it’s perfect for the office or any professional setting — very clean and sophisticated without feeling stuffy or overly stuck up but instead more just ""put together""  it just gives class and elegance in a really effortless way. it wasn’t an instant favourite for me, but definitely something i’ve come to appreciate and enjoy. 6.75/10



# dossier floral grapefruit 7/10

this one is definitely more sharp and citrusy than most of the fragrances i own, but that’s exactly what i was looking for when trying to explore this scent family. I really wanted something that absolutely emulated the clean girl aesthetic, something fresh, light and girly without being overpowering, i had previously tried tried floral pear before for this exact reason and didn’t really connect with it — it was too bar soapy for me, and was much more of a skin scent. i’ve always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with that one. sometimes i like it, sometimes i don’t.

floral grapefruit, on the other hand, leans stronger and sharper. it gives clean girl vibes in a more bold and noticeable way, which i really appreciate. it’s definitely more potent than floral pear, so if you prefer something more toned down and soft, that one might be a better fit. but for me, floral grapefruit strikes the right balance.

what i really love is how clear and well-blended the notes are — i can pick up the grapefruit, pear, and blackcurrant right away. then the florals in the middle — hyacinth, jasmine, and lilac — come through softly, adding some brightness. as it dries down, the musk, amberwood, and orris settle in and give it more depth, which makes it feel more rounded and wearable.

overall, i’m really satisfied with this fragrance. i don’t absolutely *looooove* or *adore* it, and it’s not my favorite style of scent, but it does a great job representing this fresh, clean, citrusy category i wanted to add to my collection. solid 7.5/10.



# dossier fruity neroli 8/10

this one is inspired by armani's my way, and really rings true to the description on the website. it’s definitely a statement scent, and i can 100% see it being a crowd-pleaser. it leans more into the deep, fruity floral side rather than being light and fresh, and that’s exactly what i love about it.

it’s super sweet and sugary — very girly and kind of gives off that playful, princess-like vibe. some people might find it a little youthful or borderline childish, but for me, it doesn’t cross that line. it just feels fun, feminine, and bold in the best way.

if you love sweet, fruity fragrances, this is a really safe blind buy. what stands out the most to me is the blackcurrant, strawberry, and tuberose — they come through clearly in the opening and heart. but the vanilla and cedarwood in the base definitely round it out and give it more depth and creaminess, which keeps it from being too airy or simple.

overall, i actually really love this scent. the performance is strong, the projection is great, and it smells exactly like something i’d wear when i want to feel cute and confident. easily a solid 8/10.



# floral marshmallow 8.5/10

this one’s inspired by kilian’s love don’t be shy. don’t get me wrong — i *reallyyyy* like this scent, but it definitely caught me off guard. i’ve never smelled the original, so i wasn’t sure what to expect, but based on the name, i assumed it would be super marshmallow-forward. instead, the first thing that hit me was citrus.

it’s still a beautiful scent — soft, sweet, and very layered — just not what i had in mind going into it. it’s less sugary than i expected, and sometimes i feel like i can barely smell the marshmallow at all. but now that i’ve worn it a few times, i realize it *is* there — it just gets a little overpowered by the bergamot and orange blossom, especially in the opening. but on the dry down the marshmallow comes out a bit more, just not enough in my opinion. the honeysuckle is tucked in there too, but it’s extremely subtle. the rest of the floral notes like jasmine and orris blend nicely, and the dry down with amber, vanilla, and musk brings warmth and smoothness.

i do wonder if letting it macerate for a couple of months it may become sweeter? but honestly i doubt it. i actually really appreciate how complex and layered this scent is. it’s not basic, and it definitely stands out in a soft, feminine way.

it’s not that i don’t love this fragrance — i do, which is why it’s rated so high on my list. but there’s just something slightly off about it to my nose. maybe it’s just that my expectations were so different. thinking it would be full-on sugary marshmallow , and instead getting something a bit more citrusy i think that threw me a bit. overall though, i still enjoy wearing it and look forward to seeing how it grows on me. i’m not sure if i’d repurchase just yet, but i’m really intrigued to smell the original now and see how they compare.  8.5/10

# ambery vanilla 9.5/10

my loveeee. this scent is everything to me. it’s sweet, warm, and so sensual — the kind of fragrance that makes you want to close your eyes and just melt. it’s right up my alley as a vanilla-forward scent, It smells extremely similar to black opium which it is inspired by (but actually better imo as black opium is a bit too sharp and less creamy for me) but it surprised me as it also really reminded me of donna born in roma extradose. 

i was a little nervous about the coffee note at first, but thankfully it doesn’t stand out on my skin. if it’s there, it blends in beautifully and just adds a bit of depth to the overall scent rather than overpowering anything. everything feels cohesive, smooth, and balanced.

this is such a grown, mature kind of sweet — not overly sugary or juvenile. it’s soft, sexy, and feminine without being too heavy. i know i’ll never get tired of this one, and i’ll definitely be repurchasing. it’s one of those scents i always want to have on hand. what really makes this fragrance shine for me are the notes. orange blossom really softens and rounds it out. the mandarin adds a bit of brightness in the opening, and while you can’t always pick out every note individually, you can definitely them working together to give the scent its depth and richness.

it’s creamy, yummy, girly, and a little bit seductive — the perfect date night fragrance. the only reason i’m not giving it a full 10/10 is because it’s not super unique. i’ve smelled many scents like this before, including the original, so it doesn’t feel groundbreaking — but i absolutely adore it regardless.



# ambery saffron 10000/10

boy oh boy, i wish i could give this scent 100000 stars. this scent took me completely by surprise! both me and my boyfriend instantly fell in love with it the moment we smelled it. it’s just so warm, smooth, and addictive. i think it’s perfectly unisex, sweet enough for me to enjoy, but not so sweet that it leans overly feminine. it hits that perfect middle ground.

i wasn’t actually the biggest fan of baccarat rouge 540 when i first tried it, but to be fair, i only smelled it on a paper strip, so i probably didn’t give it a real chance. if this is as close as people say, then i completely understand the obsession now. this version just works so well on skin. it’s warm, spicy, and slightly sweet, with a really smooth amber base that becomes more noticeable as it dries down. and i love the hint of white floral in it! it’s soft and clean, not overpowering.

what surprises me most is that i’m usually not into woody or musky scents at all, but here, they’re done in a way that adds depth without being too much. it’s subtle but still gives the perfume that lasting power and structure. somehow everything just comes together so beautifully.

i haven’t even made a dent in my bottle but i’m already planning to buy three more. this is easily one of my  favourite fragrances right now, comforting, elegant, and super wearable. it’s the kind of scent you just keep reaching for without even thinking.





anyways that’s it! i really hope this was somewhat helpful and gave you a bit more insight into what these perfumes actually smell like. overall, i do really love dossier and will definitely be buying more from them in the future. i’m not too worried about taking risks with new scents since their return process is super easy and straightforward.

1jm0ndt,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1jm0ndt/dossier_fragrances_review_12_fragrances_long/,Dossier Fragrances Review - 12 Fragrances [LONG],"so i thought i’d come on here and share my honest thoughts on 12 dossier fragrances i picked up during their recent sale. i got **amber saffron, floral pear, ambery vanilla, woody sandalwood, ambery vetiver, floral marshmallow, woody sage, powdery peach, fruity neroli, woody chestnut, fruity neroli, floral grapefruit and musky musk**, i definitely bought them with the intention of returning a few, but i was really curious about the brand. i’ve seen so many good things online — how close they are to the originals, how well they perform, how lovely they smell — so i figured it was finally time to try a bunch for myself and see what the hype was about.

honestly, it was a very mixed bag. some scents i genuinely fell in love with, and others just weren’t for me at all. for some context, i usually lean towards sweet, gourmand, vanilla-heavy perfumes, but i also enjoy a few airy, mature, or floral scents when done right. some of my favourite fragrances include **ysl mon paris, libre intense, kayali vanilla candy rock sugar, yum boujee marshmallow, vanilla 28, parfums de marly valaya, and sol de janeiro 62** — so that should give you a sense of what i usually go for.

just to be clear, i ***haven’t*** smelled most (if any) of the original fragrances these are inspired by. the purpose of this haul wasn’t to compare them to the designer versions — i can’t really speak on that. i already have a decent selection of designer perfumes and didn’t feel the need to buy dupes of them yet since I’m not running out of them anytime soon. this was more about trying new things, stepping a little out of my comfort zone, exploring new sent families and figuring out what actually works for me.

so if you’re looking for a post that breaks down how similar these are to the *originals*, this probably won’t help much. but if you want honest opinions on how they actually smell, how they wear, how accurate they are to their descriptions, and whether they’re worth buying — then keep reading!!!

fair warning: it’s **long**. i wanted to be as thorough and honest as possible — no commission-based tiktoker fluff here, just my real thoughts as someone who loves fragrance and wanted to test these properly. i will be ranking these from worst to best :)



# woody sandalwood 2/10

this is a dupe for le labo's santal 33. i had really high hopes for this scent. and i seriously tried. it’s a such crowd favourite on tiktok, and so many influencers (even the super girly ones you wouldn’t expect) call it their go-to. that really intrigued me, because i thought maybe this was the kind of deeper, woody scent i could finally get into.

unfortunately, it completely missed the mark for me. the notes sound beautiful on paper: violet leaves, cardamom, orris, ambrox, cedarwood, cypriol, musk, sandalwood, amber. but to my nose, all i could smell was *wood*. just layer after layer of straight woodiness, and nothing about it was soft or inviting. it was very dry, very sharp, and extremely headache-inducing. i even tried layering it with my sweeter fragrances but literally nothing helped.

i really tried to like it, but every time i wore it, i felt overwhelmed. it just didn’t blend well with my personal taste or body chemistry. i know a lot of people love it — and if you’re into heavy, woody profiles, it might work for you  (my boyfriend actually liked this one)—but if you're more into sweet, soft, or gourmand scents, this might not be the right fit as it was a clear no for me. 2/10



# woody sage 4/10

this is a dupe for jo malone's wood sage and sea salt. i don’t hate this fragrance, but i don’t particularly like it either. it leans too earthy and woody for my personal taste, which i kind of expected — i’ve been trying to ease myself into more woody scents, but i’m realising they’re just not really my thing.

i started with woody sandalwood, which i absolutely hated — it gave me a headache and was way too heavy. so i thought woody sage might be a milder introduction to that family, and it is. it’s definitely more toned down and wearable, but even then, it’s still not something i see myself reaching for on its own.

it has a very literal scent profile — it smells like a mix between a forest and salty sea air, which is actually kind of cool. i can see how someone else would love this. and i will say, when i layer it with sweeter fragrances like vanilla or floral marshmallow, it actually adds some really nice depth and balance. so in that way, i don’t mind having it.

but on its own, it’s not something i enjoy enough to wear. the marine salt, fig tree, grapefruit, clary sage, and amberwood all come through clearly, and now that i’ve smelled it, i can confidently say this scent profile just isn’t for me. apparently it smells identical to the original, so if that’s your vibe, you’ll probably love this — but for me, it’s a pass. 4/10



# woody chestnut: 5/10 for layering: 8/10

this one was tough for me. woody chestnut is inspired by maison margiela’s by the fireplace, and i really, really wanted to love it. the description had me sold — cozy, crackling fire, warm cabin vibes — it sounds like something i’d be obsessed with. and to be fair, when you smell it, it really does live up to that description. it smells exactly like what it’s meant to.

but this was another case of me thinking i’d like a scent profile, only to realise it’s just not for me. apparently there’s vanilla in the base, which i was hoping would come through a bit more to add sweetness. while it does make the scent feel slightly creamier, it doesn’t shift the overall tone — it still leans very smoky and wody, and not in a way i personally enjoy. i don’t hate it, but i also don’t love it, and i would never wear this on its own. 

*but with that being said*, it’s absolutely ***FANTASTIC***  as a layering scent. paired with something like kayali vanilla 28, it transforms into this warm, cozy, slightly sensual winter dream. it adds a beautiful depth and richness to sweeter fragrances, and for that reason, i’m actually really happy to have it in my collection. as a standalone fragrance, i’d rate it a 5/10. but as a layering fragrance, especially for the colder months, it easily jumps to an 8. i can’t wait to pull it out in winter and mix it with my favorites!

# floral pear 5/10

i had high hopes for this one. i kept seeing people describe it as the perfect clean girl scent, and that’s exactly what i was going for. and to be fair, it *is* clean — very fresh, very light. but to me, it leans too far into that soapy territory. it doesn’t open up in a bright or fruity way like i expected. instead, it smells almost like a high-end bar of soap, which isn’t bad, but not something i personally want to wear.

in terms of the notes, i mostly got the pear right away, and a little bit of freesia. on the dry down, there’s a hint of musk, but i could barely detect any amber at all. again, i don’t even dislike this fragrance — i just *wanted* to like it more. the overly soapy quality is what’s holding it back from being great in my opinion.

i haven’t tried the original english pear & freesia by jo malone, so i can’t say how close it is to that. i considered keeping it, but deep down i knew i wouldn’t reach for it over other scents i actually enjoy. it’s nice in theory, just not something that fits my style. 5/10



# powdery peach 6/10

this one is honestly a toss-up for me. it's inspired by jimmy choo i want choo and if it performs better and is more intense than powdery peach, i might have to get it. i have such a love-hate relationship with this perfume. i’ve seen people online say it’s super strong, and even on the website it’s listed as a statement scent, but that wasn’t my experience at all. i found it to be really light — sometimes i could barely smell it on my skin even after an hour.

it performs a little better on clothes, and there have been times where i’ve caught a soft whiff and thought “wait, what’s that?” only to realise it was powdery peach. but overall, i don’t find it to be intense or long-lasting. i don’t really get how it’s marketed as statement on their website’s scent intensity scale when it feels so subtle.

as for the scent itself, it’s very airy and citrusy with just the slightest hint of sweetness. it’s not too sharp or tangy like some citrus perfumes, which i actually appreciate. there’s a softness to it, the vanilla is barely there but gives it a touch of warmth and sweetness, while the blackcurrant and tangerine come through more clearly than the actual peach, which was i wasn’t expecting since i was hoping for something more peach-forward.

i actually really really like the smell of this fragrance, but its performance and longevity just lets it down for me. I don’t know if it’s a case of I need to let it macerate for awhile before the intenseness really comes out, but as is, it’s a bit lighter than I would like, it’s also really powdery too which I guess is reflected in the name.

i really wanted to love this because i usually enjoy peach scents, but this just didn’t quite land for me. it’s not bad at all — i’d probably give it a 6.5 out of 10 — but it didn’t leave much of an impression, and i’m not sure i’d reach for it often. 



# ambery vetiver 6.75/10

i definitely wasn’t expecting this to smell the way it does, but honestly, i mean that in a good way. it’s fresh, citrusy, and clean — exactly what it claims to be. it reminds me of an expensive hotel spa in the best way, and there’s something really calm and polished about it.

this isn’t usually my go-to scent profile since i tend to lean more toward deep, sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially anything with vanilla or warm notes. but i’ve been trying to branch out and try new things, and this one has been growing on me more and more each day.

i’m really picking up all the notes in this — the bergamot, lemon, and buchu up top give it that fresh, citrusy feel, while the orange blossom, marigold, and violet in the heart add some softness and complexity. the base of vetiver, amber, and cedarwood gives it just enough warmth and depth. even the cedarwood, which can sometimes be too much for me, is really subtle here, and that’s a good thing.

# dossier floral grapefruit 7/10

I really wanted something that absolutely emulated the clean girl aesthetic, something fresh, light and girly without being overpowering, i had previously tried tried floral pear before for this exact reason and didn’t really connect with it — it was too bar soapy for me, and was much more of a skin scent. i’ve always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with that one. sometimes i like it, sometimes i don’t.

floral grapefruit, on the other hand, leans stronger and sharper. it gives clean girl vibes in a more bold and noticeable way, which i really appreciate. it’s definitely more potent than floral pear, so if you prefer something more toned down and soft, that one might be a better fit. but for me, floral grapefruit strikes the right balance.

what i really love is how clear and well-blended the notes are — i can pick up the grapefruit, pear, and blackcurrant right away. then the florals in the middle — hyacinth, jasmine, and lilac — come through softly, adding some brightness. as it dries down, the musk, amberwood, and orris settle in and give it more depth, which makes it feel more rounded and wearable.

overall, i’m really satisfied with this fragrance. i don’t absolutely *looooove* or *adore* it, and it’s not my favorite style of scent, but it does a great job representing this fresh, clean, citrusy category i wanted to add to my collection. solid 7.5/10.



# dossier fruity neroli 8/10

this one is inspired by armani's my way, and really rings true to the description on the website. it’s definitely a statement scent, and i can 100% see it being a crowd-pleaser. it leans more into the deep, fruity floral side rather than being light and fresh, and that’s exactly what i love about it.

it’s super sweet and sugary — very girly and kind of gives off that playful, princess-like vibe. some people might find it a little youthful or borderline childish, but for me, it doesn’t cross that line. it just feels fun, feminine, and bold in the best way.

if you love sweet, fruity fragrances, this is a really safe blind buy. what stands out the most to me is the blackcurrant, strawberry, and tuberose — they come through clearly in the opening and heart. but the vanilla and cedarwood in the base definitely round it out and give it more depth and creaminess, which keeps it from being too airy or simple.

overall, i actually really love this scent. the performance is strong, the projection is great, and it smells exactly like something i’d wear when i want to feel cute and confident. easily a solid 8/10.

# woody sandalwood 2/10

this is a dupe for le labo's santal 33. i had really high hopes for this scent. and i seriously tried. it’s a such crowd favourite on tiktok, and so many influencers (even the super girly ones you wouldn’t expect) call it their go-to. that really intrigued me, because i thought maybe this was the kind of deeper, woody scent i could finally get into.

unfortunately, it completely missed the mark for me. the notes sound beautiful on paper: violet leaves, cardamom, orris, ambrox, cedarwood, cypriol, musk, sandalwood, amber. but to my nose, all i could smell was *wood*. just layer after layer of straight woodiness, and nothing about it was soft or inviting. it was very dry, very sharp, and extremely headache-inducing. i even tried layering it with my sweeter fragrances but literally nothing helped.

i really tried to like it, but every time i wore it, i felt overwhelmed. it just didn’t blend well with my personal taste or body chemistry. i know a lot of people love it — and if you’re into heavy, woody profiles, it might work for you  (my boyfriend actually liked this one)—but if you're more into sweet, soft, or gourmand scents, this might not be the right fit as it was a clear no for me. 2/10



# woody sage 4/10

this is a dupe for jo malone's wood sage and sea salt. i don’t hate this fragrance, but i don’t particularly like it either. it leans too earthy and woody for my personal taste, which i kind of expected — i’ve been trying to ease myself into more woody scents, but i’m realising they’re just not really my thing.

i started with woody sandalwood, which i absolutely hated — it gave me a headache and was way too heavy. so i thought woody sage might be a milder introduction to that family, and it is. it’s definitely more toned down and wearable, but even then, it’s still not something i see myself reaching for on its own.

it has a very literal scent profile — it smells like a mix between a forest and salty sea air, which is actually kind of cool. i can see how someone else would love this. and i will say, when i layer it with sweeter fragrances like vanilla or floral marshmallow, it actually adds some really nice depth and balance. so in that way, i don’t mind having it.

but on its own, it’s not something i enjoy enough to wear. the marine salt, fig tree, grapefruit, clary sage, and amberwood all come through clearly, and now that i’ve smelled it, i can confidently say this scent profile just isn’t for me. apparently it smells identical to the original, so if that’s your vibe, you’ll probably love this — but for me, it’s a pass. 4/10



# woody chestnut: 5/10 for layering: 8/10

this one was tough for me. woody chestnut is inspired by maison margiela’s by the fireplace, and i really, really wanted to love it. the description had me sold — cozy, crackling fire, warm cabin vibes — it sounds like something i’d be obsessed with. and to be fair, when you smell it, it really does live up to that description. it smells exactly like what it’s meant to.

but this was another case of me thinking i’d like a scent profile, only to realise it’s just not for me. apparently there’s vanilla in the base, which i was hoping would come through a bit more to add sweetness. while it does make the scent feel slightly creamier, it doesn’t shift the overall tone — it still leans very smoky and wody, and not in a way i personally enjoy. i don’t hate it, but i also don’t love it, and i would never wear this on its own. 

*but with that being said*, it’s absolutely ***FANTASTIC***  as a layering scent. paired with something like kayali vanilla 28, it transforms into this warm, cozy, slightly sensual winter dream. it adds a beautiful depth and richness to sweeter fragrances, and for that reason, i’m actually really happy to have it in my collection. as a standalone fragrance, i’d rate it a 5/10. but as a layering fragrance, especially for the colder months, it easily jumps to an 8. i can’t wait to pull it out in winter and mix it with my favorites!

# floral pear 5/10

i had high hopes for this one. i kept seeing people describe it as the perfect clean girl scent, and that’s exactly what i was going for. and to be fair, it *is* clean — very fresh, very light. but to me, it leans too far into that soapy territory. it doesn’t open up in a bright or fruity way like i expected. instead, it smells almost like a high-end bar of soap, which isn’t bad, but not something i personally want to wear.

in terms of the notes, i mostly got the pear right away, and a little bit of freesia. on the dry down, there’s a hint of musk, but i could barely detect any amber at all. again, i don’t even dislike this fragrance — i just *wanted* to like it more. the overly soapy quality is what’s holding it back from being great in my opinion.

i haven’t tried the original english pear & freesia by jo malone, so i can’t say how close it is to that. i considered keeping it, but deep down i knew i wouldn’t reach for it over other scents i actually enjoy. it’s nice in theory, just not something that fits my style. 5/10



# powdery peach 6/10

this one is honestly a toss-up for me. it's inspired by jimmy choo i want choo and if it performs better and is more intense than powdery peach, i might have to get it. i have such a love-hate relationship with this perfume. i’ve seen people online say it’s super strong, and even on the website it’s listed as a statement scent, but that wasn’t my experience at all. i found it to be really light — sometimes i could barely smell it on my skin even after an hour.

it performs a little better on clothes, and there have been times where i’ve caught a soft whiff and thought “wait, what’s that?” only to realise it was powdery peach. but overall, i don’t find it to be intense or long-lasting. i don’t really get how it’s marketed as statement on their website’s scent intensity scale when it feels so subtle.

as for the scent itself, it’s very airy and citrusy with just the slightest hint of sweetness. it’s not too sharp or tangy like some citrus perfumes, which i actually appreciate. there’s a softness to it, the vanilla is barely there but gives it a touch of warmth and sweetness, while the blackcurrant and tangerine come through more clearly than the actual peach, which was i wasn’t expecting since i was hoping for something more peach-forward.

i actually really really like the smell of this fragrance, but its performance and longevity just lets it down for me. I don’t know if it’s a case of I need to let it macerate for awhile before the intenseness really comes out, but as is, it’s a bit lighter than I would like, it’s also really powdery too which I guess is reflected in the name.

i really wanted to love this because i usually enjoy peach scents, but this just didn’t quite land for me. it’s not bad at all — i’d probably give it a 6.5 out of 10 — but it didn’t leave much of an impression, and i’m not sure i’d reach for it often. 



# ambery vetiver 6.75/10

i definitely wasn’t expecting this to smell the way it does, but honestly, i mean that in a good way. it’s fresh, citrusy, and clean — exactly what it claims to be. it reminds me of an expensive hotel spa in the best way, and there’s something really calm and polished about it.

this isn’t usually my go-to scent profile since i tend to lean more toward deep, sweet, gourmand fragrances, especially anything with vanilla or warm notes. but i’ve been trying to branch out and try new things, and this one has been growing on me more and more each day.

i’m really picking up all the notes in this — the bergamot, lemon, and buchu up top give it that fresh, citrusy feel, while the orange blossom, marigold, and violet in the heart add some softness and complexity. the base of vetiver, amber, and cedarwood gives it just enough warmth and depth. even the cedarwood, which can sometimes be too much for me, is really subtle here, and that’s a good thing.

it’s inspired by byredo’s bal d’afrique, and i can absolutely see why this would be a go-to or everyday scent for a lot of people. it’s perfect for the office or any professional setting — very clean and sophisticated without feeling stuffy or overly stuck up but instead more just ""put together""  it just gives class and elegance in a really effortless way. it wasn’t an instant favourite for me, but definitely something i’ve come to appreciate and enjoy. 6.75/10



# dossier floral grapefruit 7/10

this one is definitely more sharp and citrusy than most of the fragrances i own, but that’s exactly what i was looking for when trying to explore this scent family. I really wanted something that absolutely emulated the clean girl aesthetic, something fresh, light and girly without being overpowering, i had previously tried tried floral pear before for this exact reason and didn’t really connect with it — it was too bar soapy for me, and was much more of a skin scent. i’ve always had a bit of a love-hate relationship with that one. sometimes i like it, sometimes i don’t.

floral grapefruit, on the other hand, leans stronger and sharper. it gives clean girl vibes in a more bold and noticeable way, which i really appreciate. it’s definitely more potent than floral pear, so if you prefer something more toned down and soft, that one might be a better fit. but for me, floral grapefruit strikes the right balance.

what i really love is how clear and well-blended the notes are — i can pick up the grapefruit, pear, and blackcurrant right away. then the florals in the middle — hyacinth, jasmine, and lilac — come through softly, adding some brightness. as it dries down, the musk, amberwood, and orris settle in and give it more depth, which makes it feel more rounded and wearable.

overall, i’m really satisfied with this fragrance. i don’t absolutely *looooove* or *adore* it, and it’s not my favorite style of scent, but it does a great job representing this fresh, clean, citrusy category i wanted to add to my collection. solid 7.5/10.



# dossier fruity neroli 8/10

this one is inspired by armani's my way, and really rings true to the description on the website. it’s definitely a statement scent, and i can 100% see it being a crowd-pleaser. it leans more into the deep, fruity floral side rather than being light and fresh, and that’s exactly what i love about it.

it’s super sweet and sugary — very girly and kind of gives off that playful, princess-like vibe. some people might find it a little youthful or borderline childish, but for me, it doesn’t cross that line. it just feels fun, feminine, and bold in the best way.

if you love sweet, fruity fragrances, this is a really safe blind buy. what stands out the most to me is the blackcurrant, strawberry, and tuberose — they come through clearly in the opening and heart. but the vanilla and cedarwood in the base definitely round it out and give it more depth and creaminess, which keeps it from being too airy or simple.

overall, i actually really love this scent. the performance is strong, the projection is great, and it smells exactly like something i’d wear when i want to feel cute and confident. easily a solid 8/10.



# floral marshmallow 8.5/10

this one’s inspired by kilian’s love don’t be shy. don’t get me wrong — i *reallyyyy* like this scent, but it definitely caught me off guard. i’ve never smelled the original, so i wasn’t sure what to expect, but based on the name, i assumed it would be super marshmallow-forward. instead, the first thing that hit me was citrus.

it’s still a beautiful scent — soft, sweet, and very layered — just not what i had in mind going into it. it’s less sugary than i expected, and sometimes i feel like i can barely smell the marshmallow at all. but now that i’ve worn it a few times, i realize it *is* there — it just gets a little overpowered by the bergamot and orange blossom, especially in the opening. but on the dry down the marshmallow comes out a bit more, just not enough in my opinion. the honeysuckle is tucked in there too, but it’s extremely subtle. the rest of the floral notes like jasmine and orris blend nicely, and the dry down with amber, vanilla, and musk brings warmth and smoothness.

i do wonder if letting it macerate for a couple of months it may become sweeter? but honestly i doubt it. i actually really appreciate how complex and layered this scent is. it’s not basic, and it definitely stands out in a soft, feminine way.

it’s not that i don’t love this fragrance — i do, which is why it’s rated so high on my list. but there’s just something slightly off about it to my nose. maybe it’s just that my expectations were so different. thinking it would be full-on sugary marshmallow , and instead getting something a bit more citrusy i think that threw me a bit. overall though, i still enjoy wearing it and look forward to seeing how it grows on me. i’m not sure if i’d repurchase just yet, but i’m really intrigued to smell the original now and see how they compare.  8.5/10

# ambery vanilla 9.5/10

my loveeee. this scent is everything to me. it’s sweet, warm, and so sensual — the kind of fragrance that makes you want to close your eyes and just melt. it’s right up my alley as a vanilla-forward scent, It smells extremely similar to black opium which it is inspired by (but actually better imo as black opium is a bit too sharp and less creamy for me) but it surprised me as it also really reminded me of donna born in roma extradose. 

i was a little nervous about the coffee note at first, but thankfully it doesn’t stand out on my skin. if it’s there, it blends in beautifully and just adds a bit of depth to the overall scent rather than overpowering anything. everything feels cohesive, smooth, and balanced.

this is such a grown, mature kind of sweet — not overly sugary or juvenile. it’s soft, sexy, and feminine without being too heavy. i know i’ll never get tired of this one, and i’ll definitely be repurchasing. it’s one of those scents i always want to have on hand. what really makes this fragrance shine for me are the notes. orange blossom really softens and rounds it out. the mandarin adds a bit of brightness in the opening, and while you can’t always pick out every note individually, you can definitely them working together to give the scent its depth and richness.

it’s creamy, yummy, girly, and a little bit seductive — the perfect date night fragrance. the only reason i’m not giving it a full 10/10 is because it’s not super unique. i’ve smelled many scents like this before, including the original, so it doesn’t feel groundbreaking — but i absolutely adore it regardless.



# ambery saffron 10000/10

boy oh boy, i wish i could give this scent 100000 stars. this scent took me completely by surprise! both me and my boyfriend instantly fell in love with it the moment we smelled it. it’s just so warm, smooth, and addictive. i think it’s perfectly unisex, sweet enough for me to enjoy, but not so sweet that it leans overly feminine. it hits that perfect middle ground.

i wasn’t actually the biggest fan of baccarat rouge 540 when i first tried it, but to be fair, i only smelled it on a paper strip, so i probably didn’t give it a real chance. if this is as close as people say, then i completely understand the obsession now. this version just works so well on skin. it’s warm, spicy, and slightly sweet, with a really smooth amber base that becomes more noticeable as it dries down. and i love the hint of white floral in it! it’s soft and clean, not overpowering.

what surprises me most is that i’m usually not into woody or musky scents at all, but here, they’re done in a way that adds depth without being too much. it’s subtle but still gives the perfume that lasting power and structure. somehow everything just comes together so beautifully.

i haven’t even made a dent in my bottle but i’m already planning to buy three more. this is easily one of my  favourite fragrances right now, comforting, elegant, and super wearable. it’s the kind of scent you just keep reaching for without even thinking.





anyways that’s it! i really hope this was somewhat helpful and gave you a bit more insight into what these perfumes actually smell like. overall, i do really love dossier and will definitely be buying more from them in the future. i’m not too worried about taking risks with new scents since their return process is super easy and straightforward.

Oh now we too are just...strangers.Does that mean he will laugh at me now? But he doesn't even look at me. Can he even look at me? Will I still disgust him?

But we weren't strangers once. Once we were something. Once my love used to be reciprocated, ten folds probably. It was really long ago and it does seem like something I just manifested, but once it was and it was I who was loved first, yearned for first. And then too this same laugh took my heart. And a bit too readily I gave it, a bit too easily. And I didn't take it back, even when he let it go, I couldn't take it back.

1jm0m4w,https://i.redd.it/wlqd31rdugre1.jpeg,Downtown Restaurant/Cafe Rant,"I want to have an open discussion about the restaurants and cafes downtown that are “catering to the working people.” 

-Im only talking about the ones that are open weekdays during working hours. -

I feel like they are losing the plot.

De Novo in the Transamerica building across from the YMCA opened recently-ish and it’s okay. They have salads with no protein that cost $9.50, I did notice the owner recently lowered the price to $8.00 but to me, that’s still wild for lettuce, croutons, dressing and some cheese. Their drinks are decently priced but one time I asked if their horchata was good and the employee literally replied “no.” Their sandwiches are anywhere from $9.50 - $11.50. Which I also think it crazy. They have a “caprese” sandwich which is $8.00. It’s just bread, tomato and dressing. They also offered a $8.00 grilled cheese on white bread. That’s nuts, again IMO.

There’s Ike’s, which is okay, at best. Also extremely pricey for the quality of food they serve. Their drinks are okay, not good or bad but I believe people just go there because our options are so few. Their sandwiches do come with a “side salad” which is a handful of spring mix and a couple croutons. 

Then there’s Eleven Cafe, which is again.. just okay. They serve little to no food, just pastry’s but every time I go, no matter what time in the morning, they are sold out. The drinks are good and decently priced but, I’m HUNGRY not thirsty ☹️

Next we have The Little One, and I used to LOVE this place. It used to be so good. But I do believe they have also lost the plot. The food quality went downhill quickly. The last time I went the food was saturated in grease. They used to give a decently size amount of chips for your salsa, last time I went and I’m not kidding, I had 4 clips. The clips and salsa are free with any order and I know it’s silly to complain about free stuff but come on. Don’t even give me the salsa if you’re going to give me only 4 chips. 

There used to be five two oh! I liked five two oh! The food was decent but it was a bit pricey. $10.00 for a salad but it did came jam packed and their ranch was delicious. Their drinks were good too and their reward system was easy and efficient. But they decided not to renew their lease and the area sat vacant for a while.

Now they are opening Yellow Brick Coffee where five two oh! used to be and I’m nervous. We really need good, decent food down here and I’m hoping it’s not the same as all the other surrounding restaurants.

Again, these are all just my opinions. I want to hear yours and what you think about the restaurants situation downtown and where do you eat? What do you like during your weekday? 

And no one say “make lunch if you’re unhappy with the restaurants.” I do make my lunch, but dang sometimes a girl wants a snack. ",1,1743183118.0,Tucson,18,0.52,False

Hey everyone.  Spicy Princess is back with another story of a bad date.  Now, you might ask, ""Spicy, why do you have so many damn stories?  You must be a friggen trainwreck yourself?!""  Well, yes, but I'm also 48 and have lived enough that I have accumulated experience throughout the years.  I'm sure there are people that can tell stories about me, because we know redheads are sociopaths.

  
Anyway, so this one took place back in 2016 or so and weirdly spanned both POF and OKCupid.  They reached out to me initially on POF and were local (note, this stopped all local potential dates and I really should have called it before this one) and since I was bored, I answered.  Suddenly, I got a message that there was something waiting for me in OKCupid.  Lo and behold, there they are not even recognizing me or that they messaged me elsewhere.

  
Whatever.  I roll my eyes, a dry spell is a dry spell, boredom is boredom, and a conversation is just that.  So, I decided to just say ""fuck it"" and and grab a coffee anyway.  When they got there, they seemed a bit unsteady.  A bit slurry.  I questioned them and they said it was because of some medication.  I mean, ok, but TBH, there was just too much that wasn't cutting it for ol' Spicy.  Lot's of things weren't adding up.  Lack of a job.  On Probation.  Their age was 5+ years older than what was listed.  When they asked if we were going to see each other again, I said ""No thanks"".

This story if for the community, to share some part of me, if you like why I shared it, I would say it in my appreciation. Should I begin? 

When I was 12 years old I felt in love at first sight for a girl. I have Asperger, so love wasn't my thing back then. 

She was in my same school. I was in my last year of elementary school and she was and her first of  middle school. I met her in my first year as freshman. 

Even though it was in grade more than me, she was my same age. She a girl as me, she was blond as me, light eyes as me... In a Caribbean country, where brown people are more usual than us. 

I discovered my feeling because I dream when she almost kissed me and I understood why I couldn't stop thinking of that girl. I wasn't afraid because she was the same gender as me, I was pissed off because this was my first love and fuck, emotions are annoying. 

I was like a normal person, but not a normal girl. I didn't like the imposed roll in society for women and always fight it. But was a religious school and well. Not a hardcore one, to me wasn't an horror, but in some kind got my amount of female bullies. 

As the people knew as a gossip about my feeling she noticed and my friends realize she felt the same for me. I had never an intentions because to me was so... Far away, and she felt the same. 

Here start the problems: she and her family was religious. She hides being another bully in the shadows. Both got obsessed with the another and later on she had her first boyfriend to hide the situation. 

All he family always knew and she preferred to hided and bully me than trust in me. That stroyed me cause well... Either way I didn't lost hope, I was young and naive. 

She stayed and the shadows and I realized she was stalking me when was in college. I did the same and she blocked me, treated me like a paria. I respeat myself: young and naive. 

The stalking became worst, almost felt like she felt like she was in a serious relationship with me in the shadows. Asperger and naive. 

We move to the same country, she got married and had children. I wanted a closure without pass her boundaries and got her email, cause she has a unique name. In the bar of Gmail was easy to find it without testing 2 times. 

I send it a emails to talk about the situation with a coffee, she treated me like a paria again but she rejected me in text. 

She always used other people or silence to bully me. Passed 16 years and because I had the guts to end the story send her a email to had my closure to all that love the put in anonymous or random people that text me to say things that only she knees about me. 

In the shadows I was almost her wife, in the real world a crazy bitch. I was beyond the word disappointment. At this point I knew the person that I first met died because of her shadow, bad habits and metal health problems. 

The moment I knew she was married and later on with a children the mug that I repare with golden glue as the Japanese art a philosophy got smashed. The duel only was one week. I got more than enough of this. 

Commitment and love to dignity was always my gold as a person. I try all my life to be treated as a person and not a second class of citizen, a crazy one because was different.

 I try all days to be a decent person. Love and help other people and say sorry and correct my behavior if I behaved wrongly. Not because I'm a religious person and I want a reward. Not because I want people to love me back.

 But because I want to die happy because I was a person that put as many grains of sand as I could to make the world a better place. Even in my small hands. That person that I loved so much, become in what I hate I combat everyday: A unloyal and corrupt person. 

So... Why I tell my story? Because I see you all waiting for the love of their life coming to your lifes. Feeling guilty and pity because made a mistake and never had the gut to confront the person. 

This sub had become a place to feel selft pitty instead of real communication. I like this sub because is one of the only ones that hasn't have censorship from reddit. I still can talk here. 

Please... If you really love that person, do something about it or someone will come to get away from you. Become a fighter, a go getter. Because in war and love everything is valid. 

If you screwed up and really feel sorry, have the gut to say it to the person you hurt, not to stranger in reddit. 

Strangers... Become in something you feel proud when you die. If you have family or other people, they remember you as a community builder, not a shadow person. 

Everybody will die, if someone is important to you, say it before is too late. Don't die with regrets. Wish you a anonymous with nothing more that a humble advice. 

P.D: this post was made it in music inspiration. I write it with a song in repeat. If you want to listen what I listened writing it, the song is ""Comptine d'un Autre été: L'Après-Midi"" from Yann Tiersen.

1jm0b6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/dysautonomia/comments/1jm0b6a/abnormal_symptoms/,Abnormal Symptoms,"So this may be long but ill try the best I can to organize my thoughts. My journey started in May of last year, 2024. I had drank a bit too much coffee that morning and headed off to work. I had to load up a bunch of concrete bags that morning. On my drive i started to feel funny. Pulled over and drank some water. Then begin driving again. Long story short called the ambulance and they came and checked on me, BP was extremely high. My fiance then came and picked me up and took me to the ER, and got checked out. Looking back now i believe i had a panic attack. Ran a bunch of tests and my doctor prescribed me high BP medication. Took it for about two months and started to feel weird so i stoped. Without the medication my BP had normalized to average about 125-120/75 without medication. During these few months i had cut out alcohol, cut back caffeine and lost weight which I believe contributed to my BP normalizing, so that was great. Ill add that for a few years i had abused alcohol due to some stressful times i had become dependent on it so cutting it out was a good thing.

Fast forward a few months I was having some odd symptoms, I believe was anxiety. due to recently getting sober. I had an echocardiogram, a stress test, and a CAC and angiogram, all came back good. I also wore a heart monitor for two weeks as well. Then I got covid back in September, relapsed on my drinking a bit during the holidays but am now sober again for the last three months.

During that time i also had a nuclear stress test done as well. Here is where all my odd symptoms come in. At first i though i had depressed my CNS so much with drinking that now that i stopped its gone haywire and extremely overactive. My BP when sitting down is 125-120/75 but ive found when i stand up i get a little weird feeling and can feel my heart beating loud. It goes away after a bit. I checked my BP while standing and it was in the 140s. I thought it was suppose to come down when standing. Although my heart rate only jumps up about 10-15 beats per minute. I also feel a lot of tightness in my neck. Sometimes when standing and walking around the house i feel like im on a boat. Not dizzy like im going to pass out or fall over but a little uneasy. I find i crave salt and sugar. I find im shaky and weak in the mornings and feel better after eating, I though maybe hypoglycemia. A lot of times i find it harder to breath like my breaths are shallow. Ive tried exercising. I used to be really into crossfit so i went back. I found upon lifting weights, not heavy, but just light to moderate i feel kinda lightheaded and weird and get a loud heartbeat afterwards, i do better with cardio exercises. Sometimes while working out i feel my body go into a panic and get sweaty palms. This is all just off the top of my head im sure theres more. Ive been to the doctor a lot, Ran almost every heart test i can do and everything came back good. But something doesnt feel right and thats when i stumbled across dysautonomia. I feel like covid either triggered something or my nervous system is just so messed up from drinking that this is all part of the healing process. Im just at a loss, and not sure what to tell the doctor anymore, so im here kind of just venting and writing down my thoughts. If you read this, thank you.

recently i’ve caught myself watching more tv with my nieces than actual playing. my days are 7:30-4:30 M-F. i’m consuming more and more coffee/energy drinks than water and overall i’m just exhausted. i sleep/lay in bed 10 minutes before i have to leave just bc i know i can get ready in ten minutes and i overall don’t have energy or interest to do things i typically enjoy. i don’t workout anymore because im drained and ive gained a little weight/loss some muscle. i obviously love my nieces very much but i feel really guilty for not being very playful with them at the moment and like a bad nanny/aunt

my older niece is obsessed with me, she refuses to play with her younger sister if im here and has a meltdown if i suggest she plays with her while i take a rest. so its constant playing unless if we watch tv or do quiet activities like coloring (which dont hold their attention for very long like tv or playing) 

luckily my sister is a teacher so i get her seasonal breaks off so ive been counting the days until her spring break. so i have a rest week coming up next month + the summer off but right now i feel so drained and i would really love to feel more energetic with them and still be able to do things i enjoy afterwards. ive talked to my sister about this so she’s going to get them on a schedule where theres no screen independent play next year

so how do yall do it? how do you guys do your job and still have energy to get through the day/do things you enjoy?

When they meet at a coffee shop, George, trying to seem sophisticated and health-conscious, casually mentions that he’s “basically a vegetarian.” Lisa is thrilled and invites him on a two-week-long hippie retreat in upstate New York, complete with meditation, tofu-based meals, and zero access to delis or diners.

Panicked, George tries to back out, but Jerry and Elaine mock him for once again lying to impress a woman. Determined not to be exposed, he enlists Kramer’s help to prepare for the trip. Kramer, always up for a challenge, puts George through a “crash course” in surviving a meat-free existence—introducing him to bizarre vegan substitutes, spiritual chants, and even a raw food diet. George, of course, hates all of it.

Meanwhile, Jerry dates a woman who constantly corrects his grammar, and Elaine gets stuck in a passive-aggressive battle with a coworker who keeps stealing her lunch.

At the retreat, George is miserable. He sneaks away at night to devour beef jerky and smuggles in a pastrami sandwich, which he eats in secret like a guilty addict. But his cover is blown when he sleep-talks about Katz’s Deli, and Lisa catches him drooling over a plate of ribs at a roadside diner on a group outing. Disgusted, she breaks up with him, calling him “a carnivorous fraud.”

As George sulks back to New York, Kramer, who visited the retreat for “the vibes,” decides to stay behind—becoming the unexpected guru of the retreat after impressing the guests with his foraging skills and bizarre wisdom.

I’m really into baking, AND I need to stop eating tons of cake (10 pounds over 3 months is no joke 🥲), but still want to keep baking and improving, so I thought of organizing a little community tasting meetup in SF.

Here’s the idea:

* Sunday meetups at Alamo Square at 2pm every 2–3 weeks. Thinking of a one-hour window so the treats stay fresh and safe to eat. And there's a coffee truck.
* Since I'm not a cake factory, I'm thinking of 3 different cakes, that makes 24 slices. Later on I might add cupcakes, tartlets, etc.
* Expect dairy, eggs, gluten, honey, berries, a splash of cognac or rum. I use only high-quality ingredients, because that’s what makes desserts actually good. Mostly peanut-free (there are a couple of recipes I might try that include peanuts, but I’ll give a heads-up).
* I’m not American, so most recipes will be Russian/European, or a take on American classics. Some will be first attempts!
* My goals: master known recipes, experiment with new ones, win over my wild oven, be happy, and meet new people
* In today's egg economy, I’ll kindly ask for small donations to cover ingredients/supplies, probably around 3 dollars per slice. If you toss in an extra dollar, I'll get a KitchenAid mixer one day.

I've never done anything like that, not even close. How do I do it? Do I make announcements here? Do I collect a list of contacts? How many spots do I open? What do I do if some people don't show up? Or I can set aside slices for those who chipped in.

And in case some of you has a similar hobby, let's get together!

[I created an event](https://partiful.com/e/S1Ccx1TH0ceRuA4QqWsb) to taste the waters, and just to be clear, you’re NOT expected to chip in ahead of time, it’s totally optional.

I’m 33, and have dealt with psoriasis since my early 20’s- especially on my back, and scalp. 

This is what has worked for me: 

Diet: I was allergy tested for foods that cause allergic reactions. 

I eat a very clean and simple diet. 
I avoid most dairy, gluten completely, nightshades, chocolate and coffee. 

I eat lean proteins (salmon, chicken, turkey, eggs) fermented foods, vegetables, berries, lots and lots of greens. 

I am ok with lentils and peas, a fermented soy products (tempeh/miso, etc.)- no allergies to these. 

I only use tallow, coconut oil, avocado oil, or butter or ghee as oils. Other healthy fats I consume are from avocados, chia seeds, and the occasional nuts (cashew, almond). 

I drink kombucha, water kefir, and drink 3-4 liters of water a day. 

I avoid alcohol and coffee completely. 


Physical movement: I workout 6 times a week, walk a minimum of 10-15,000 steps a day. 

Light: I do red light therapy 2-3 times a week, and sunbathe for 20 minute increments during the day.  

Other supplements: vitamin D/K3, Pao d’ arco, Quercetin, bromelain, NAC, daily probiotic, collagen peptides. 

Skincare: I didn’t use any lotions, just coconut oil. I used dermasolve products for my scalp. 

I’ve stuck to this routine for over 6 months and my psoriasis from my whole body has cleared. I really didn’t want to take a biologic, but heal my body from root cause of inflammation. You have to stay so consistent. 

I lost 25 lbs in this process, which I also believed helped a lot. 

I know this won’t work for everyone- but it’s just what has worked for me. 

Anyways. I’m curious on feedback and questions- also why has worked for you. ",2,1743181912.0,Psoriasis,8,1.0,False

I'm doing a 5 week trip around Seoul and Japan (Seoul with a friend then 3 weeks in Japan solo). Haven't booked my flight home yet but I have 2 options... no direct flight to London from Osaka (probs wouldn't have been able to afford it anyways) but I can either book a night flight from Osaka to Singapore, 4h layover, then to London. Or, I can book a morning flight to Hanoi (land at 1pm), 21h layover, then flight to London at 1pm the following day. Layover in Vietnam is like £90 cheaper than doing the Singapore flight and I'm not super worried about cost anyways (this is a post-uni graduate blow out so yolo). I'm considering doing it and booking a £27 hotel right in the Old Quarter - my plan would be to land, get a Grab to Old Quarter, walk round Hoan Kiem Lake, get a late lunch and try some Viet sweet treats and an egg coffee, maybe look at a couple shops, get a dinner, then early night in a nice bed and get a Grab early to the airport for my flight back to London. Wouldn't be planning on a night out or anything... I just love walking round new places and trying new foods!! 

Basically just writing to ask, anyone who's been to Hanoi - do you think it'll be too overwhelming and just too much to do this? I've heard a lot about Vietnam being super hectic. In my head this would be so fun and random and give me a quick chance to be in a totally different culture, but I have a friend who's in Hanoi right now who thinks its deffo overkill. On top of this, I've seen lots about Hanoi (+ Vietnam in general) being super safe - girls who've been to Hanoi, do you agree? Did you feel safe as a solo female traveller? (Just want to add the 3 weeks I'm in Japan I'm solo for the first time ever, however not super worried about it being busy and overwhelming in big cities because I'm from London and lived in Central by a tourist attraction so am kind of accustomed in that respect lol) I KNOW 24h is not enough to properly do Hanoi and I am hoping in the future to do a big Vietnam trip but just thinking while this option is right in front of me....

For years I've preferred Peet's Big Bang coffee, but it can be a little too much.  Some mornings when I would have preferred plain black coffee, I doctored it with milk etc anyway just to gentle it down a little.  Some days I don't mind having my palate violated and shot out of a cannon sideways, but it's not for every day.

My wife got a can of Bustelo coffee to try.  She didn't like it, so gave it to me.  It's pleasant, but rather bland and with such a gentle rise I thought it was decaf at first.

On a lark I tried mixing Bustelo and Big Bang grounds together, 50/50, and got something quite a bit better than the sum of its parts.  It has an amazingly rich, complex flavor, without feeling like it's assaulting my mouth, and a strong caffeine rise which feels more like a kick and not an explosion.

I've been enjoying it so much that when the Bustelo ran out I got another one, poured half of it into the old can, and filled both cans the rest of the way with Big Bang so now I have two cans of the blend.

The main takeaway here is that blending coffees can be synergistic, so playing around a bit with different blends might yield something special.",2,1743181779.0,foodhacks,4,0.67,False

Ever feel like your to-do list is trying to take over the world, one unchecked box at a time? 🗒️ Like, we're all superheroes out here, just without the capes or cool theme music. But what if I told you there’s a way to get those hours back and leave that ""always behind"" feeling in the dust? Enter the mystical art of **time blocking**, my friends.

So, what *is* time blocking? Think of it as the Tetris game of productivity—strategically fitting every task into its perfect spot. Instead of reacting to whatever's shouting the loudest, you're calling the shots by deciding *when* you'll focus on *what*.

**Here’s a sneak peek into how time blocking could save you 10 hours a week:**

- **Banting the Beast of Distraction**: Ever find yourself 45 minutes into watching cat videos when you only meant to check one email? By setting specific blocks of time for tasks and sticking to them, you say goodbye to accidental YouTube marathons.

- **Prioritization Made Easy**: You know that thing where everything feels important and nothing gets done? Yeah, you don't need that. Block out time for big rock tasks first (you know, the ones that actually move the needle) and fit in the pebbles later.

- **The Buffer Bliss**: Life happens, right? Meetings run late, inspiration strikes (finally), or maybe coffee spills—build in buffer blocks. That way, when life throws a curveball, you’re still batting 1000.

- **Batch Work Bonanza**: Group similar tasks to keep your brain from switching gears—it's kind of like being in the zone, but with less sweat and more coffee.

Here’s my own little story with time blocking: So, I was drowning in this sea of half-finished projects and endless errands. Tried every planner under the sun (planners DO lie sometimes 😅), until a wise friend suggested time blocking. Took a week, maybe two, to really nail it, but the payoff? Priceless. Suddenly, I had *time*—real, inviting time—to catch up with friends, pick up a new hobby, and, yes, even squeeze in a nap or two.

**How do you start?** Try blocking an hour tomorrow. Give it a shot and see how it feels. Your calendar is your canvas—paint it your way! 🎨

Alright, gang, that’s my rant for the day. Who's ready to time block and roll, and how’s it going for you if you’ve already started? Let's keep this convo alive and growing. Can't wait to hear your thoughts!

Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with GERD for a while and dealing with some frustrating side effects—constant belching, brain fog, and headaches, especially in the morning. It feels like my acid reflux isn’t just affecting my stomach but also messing with my head. My mind feels foggy, and I just feel off. 

I usually take Pepcid before a heavy meal, but once I start eating trigger foods, I tend to go overboard. That leads to me taking Pepcid for multiple days in a row. When I finally stop, the reflux comes back with a vengeance.

My doctors are clueless and Prilosec and nexium do nothing for me:(

Lately, I’ve been trying to manage it by sticking to reflux-friendly foods (oatmeal, lean proteins, non-acidic veggies), drinking more water, and avoiding triggers like coffee and spicy foods.

Has anyone else experienced this? What has helped you? Have antihistamines, Tylenol, or anything else worked for you? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips that might help!

While designing ads is exciting, skipping the crucial first step—choosing the right product—can spell disaster for your campaign.

Just think about creating a great painting but when you finally finish it…uh, oh it doesn’t match the demographic you wanted. That could lead to misaligned ads, wasted budget, and poor results being the sad reality.

In this post, we’ll reveal the prospects most **Amazon FBA** sellers don’t know they are missing out on when the ad comes before the product.

*Read More:* [*How Can You Identify the Best Creative for Your Amazon Ads?*](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-can-you-identify-the-best-creative-for-your-amazon-ads/)

# Common Pitfalls of Designing Ads Without a Chosen Product

It may sound like a good strategy to create ads before choosing a product, but actually, it leads only to more time and money spent, unnecessary work, and incorrect campaigns. It fails to capture the essence of the ad goal, that is the ability to map the product ad to its features, audience, and demand. 

# Misaligned Target Audience

When designing an ad with no specific product in mind, then one is more likely to market the wrong demographic. This basically means that without knowing who the product is targeted, the ads could be a total turn off to some potential customers.

* For example, an **Amazon FBA** seller develops an advert for a ‘universal kitchen tool,’ but then goes for a premium, professional cutting knife. Cautious is taken not to appeal directly to the person most likely to be purchasing the food – professional chefs – but rather the folks who are doing the actual cooking.

To avoid this, select your product first, and then narrow down your audience. Take advantage of the audience and try to create a message which informs, interests and captivates viewers, readers and listeners. 

* For instance, you may want to emphasise on sharpness and robustness of the knife as a preparing kitchen tool for professional cooks. Knowledge about the audience makes the ad to convey appropriate messages to target customers and increases the chances of conversions.

# Inconsistent Messaging

When using this kind of ad format, lack of a product means that the message being passed can be generalized, or it does not make any sense at all. This impacts potential customers confusing the brands, eventually diminishing click-through rates. 

Think about an ad that says “Transform your kitchen experience” and the result is a product that is a bottle opener. A gap is created resulting in the disinterest and dissatisfaction of the buyers.

If you have a product that you wish to advertise and promote, then choosing the product in advance means that your message is much more likely to focus on what exactly you are selling.

 In this case, ensure that the bottle opener fits well in hand or that it will not be ruined after everybody has used it. Targeted advertising personalities the consumer’s journey from the advertisement to the product page, increasing customer confidence.

# Overpromising Features

Ads created prematurely contain elements that are misleading since they advertise certain features the product lacks. These lead to dissatisfaction among customers, and in the worst case scenarios; the business gets a pull-down by customer reviews.

* For instance, a skincare brand has a product with a tagline ‘get rid of wrinkles now’ then release another one ‘that can minimize fine lines after some time’.

To this end, one should ensure the ad’s assertions are based on the reality of the product in question. Do not use headline-making claims; use realistic slogans such as “noticeable improvement in four weeks.”

 On the bright side, the ethos established through the proper disclosure shows that honesty in advertising strengthens connection with customers for the long term.

# Misused Budget

Creating an ad too early has its disadvantage because the brand is creating a general advertisement campaign, not a product specific one. 

* For example, an **Amazon FBA** seller spends $500 on the ads for ‘great gadgets’ only to fixate on a smart home gadget. Several of the ads get clicked from users who are not interested in the business gadgets, but some other related gadgets instead.

It means choosing your product first is more effective because it lets you build the budget more effectively. Make use of a relatively small campaign ad for the product in experimentation before expanding to a massive one.

 This is handy as it eradicates repeat advertisement by only featuring the advertisements that investors are willing to fund hence reducing wastage of your advertising budget.

# Lack of Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)

Generic advertisements that are not coupled with a preferred product often do not have clear call to action messages that can compel the potential customer into the next line of action. An ad that appears like, ‘Shop the best in home improvement’, but makes no effort to guide the user to a product of that nature is not beneficial.

Once you are done with choosing your product, come up with a specific call to action statement, for example ‘Shop the most durable power drill today.’ This call to action is clear, concise and specific to assist customers into getting to the end goal to improve conversions.

# Ineffective Keyword Targeting

This not only makes it difficult for the sales team to know which keywords to use when advertising the product, thus the sale of the product is affected. An ad set for the keywords such as “gadget” or “kitchen tool” that advertises a very specific sous vide machine brings the wrong audience.

The second step is to do keyword research after you have chosen your product. Concenter the keywords on special terms that are closely related to your product and its target audience. Known as a post-click strategy, this enhances the visibility of the ad to the right customers and boost click through rates.

# Poor Visual Content

Creatives that are made for ad-only solutions are often rather vague and do not illustrate the product for its strengths. 

* For instance, a generic ad displays a picture of a kitchen as common as on other home-related sites but, at the bottom of the webpage, contains a link to a more specialized and expensive stand mixer. In this case, buyers do not view features of the product when making their purchase unless they decide to stop and watch the ads on an advertisement break.

Leverage **listing images** or videos with high quality of your product that shows how the product is used. It is necessary to draw attention to it and gain trust highlighting its distinct characteristics. The message that relates to features that make up the said product captures the attention of prospective customers better.

# Poor Conversion Rates

It’s not possible to compare with competitors and place your ad in order that will be seen as the best one without a product. An ad promoting “high-tech fitness gear” does not pull out the stops and tell consumers how its product is superior to other similar products.

Stakeholder analysis should be conducted after you have chosen your product. Emphasize on the advantages of the product including degree of the product which indicates it is stronger or has more features than other products. 

The concept of positioning enables one to place a product on a pedestal and also draw customers towards it.

# Poor Conversion Rates

Non-technical advertisements do not get increased click through rates as people don’t get what they were looking for. 

Make sure that the ad has the same attribute as the one appealing to the products. Include specific examples of your product or service in your ad; for instance use “Diaper bag that has compartments for heating of baby’s feed”. When the advertisement is directly linked to the specific product the chances of conversion are heightened.

# Wasted Time and Resources

At the beginning, ad design consumes time and money, which can be used to focus on the product research and development. An innovation team invests lots of time designing an ad campaign for a product that never existed only to realize it is not needed in the market.

Always spend a lot of time in the selection of the products and the market they should be placed in before concentrating on the ads to be produced.

 It’s a good idea to have the green highlighted to ensure demand; you can use surveys or an A/B test for the green highlight. This approach makes your efforts productive, and guarantees that your ads are efficient and productive.

# What Happens to ROI When Ads Are Misaligned?

Misaligned ads can dramatically harm your return on investment (ROI), leading to wasted budget, reduced brand credibility, and diminished campaign effectiveness. 

When advertising strategies fail to align with the target audience or product offering, the consequences ripple across your marketing efforts, weakening performance and potentially causing long-term damage. Let’s explore how misaligned ads affect ROI and how you can correct these misalignments.

# Poor Audience Targeting Wastes Ad Spend

Mismatched sequences also lead to low correct customer reach, arguably one of the leading pitfalls that may cost a lot of your ad budget. Running your ads in front of the wrong set of eyes that are not in the market for what you are offering results in a high cost per click CPC with little or no conversions. 

* For instance, using interest-agnostic premium car brand advertisements on demographics without considering the purchasing behavior, the luxury car manufacturer can get a high CTR but very low conversion. This means that your advertising dollars are spent on driving click-intents that do not result in sales; a total loss.

The real purpose behind it is that most of the advertising mediums, like Google Ads and Facebook Ads, work on an algorithm model to analyze the right time to deliver the ads to the consumer. These platforms depend on algorithms that figure out who should get the impression of the ad. 

If your target audience is too large or not relevant enough, the system could display your advertisements to people who could not be interested in your product at all. 

While getting many clicks on your site, lack of outcome involving the visitors to become customers in business will make the overall return on investment poor.

# Low Conversion Rates

It becomes very disappointing when your ads get to the right audience but end up getting low conversions or a low ROI. Conversion rates are the number of visitors who complete the intended action within the session, often become clients, subscribe to a service, or fill in a contact form.

 When there is a very high value for CTR but a comparably very low value for conversion, that suggests that maybe the ad that you are putting out is not what the targeted folks wanted to see or actually needed to see.

* For instance, an organisation which sells luxury skincare may create an advert for luxury items but direct clients to a landing page that sells inexpensive skin care products. This creates a dubious gap between the ad and the landing page, which may frustrate a target customer leading to them leaving the page without buying a product. 

This allows you to avoid low conversion rates and make sure that the message of the ad and the page you lead people to are connected. The information set in the ad and the call-to-action must align with the experience of the client when s/he follows the ad link.

 If you have two different ad designs, two different landing pages or two sets of new call to action buttons, you can use A/B testing on which combination produces the highest conversion rates.

 When you continue using the same messages, calls to action, and designs, you limit the possibilities of discovering what appeals to your audience the most.

# Damage to Brand Reputation

Misaligned ads not only reduce the ROI in the current climate but also pose a danger to a brand. Where your ad attempts to create the expectation of something that is not met or even where the product advertised contradicts what your ad portrays it to be then you could easily get into the bad books of the public. 

* For example, if an e-commerce platform places an advertisement highlighting “next-day delivery” while the brand only provides standard delivery, it is highly possible that customers will feel deceived. It is unwise to have such discrepancies because they may reduce the trust customers have in your brand and the information they are fed with both from existing and potential consumers.

Brand image is undoubtedly one of the most important corporate treasures. Lack of customer satisfaction from interaction with an organisation and its products or services due to such factors as misleading or misaligned advertisements results in increased churn rate, decreased customer loyalty and negative word of mouth. 

Offering good customer service and after selling experiences are as crucial, to stabilize and strengthen brand image. That is the reason why it is important to respond as soon as possible, for example, in case some problems occur and it will help to avoid damaging relations between the customers of your brand.

#  Inefficient Budget Allocation

Inappropriate ad placements also mean the allocation of resources is not as effective as it should be because the magazine must spend money to place these ads, and poor placement means low returns on investment. 

Thus, if your advertising overall does not attract the correct audience or if the promotions are not properly worded, you will find that you spend more money on useless campaigns. 

* For instance, you targeted to allocate a large share of your budget towards high cost, which pertains to keywords or even premium ad spaces that are not likely to convert customers. Therefore, you may end up running out of cash to fund the better channels or keywords that generate the right sales.

Without proper coordination between the ad and the target group, there arises a problem of maximizing your investments in advertising. Lack of proper budget utilization implies that the money is wasted on areas that do not possess high ROI, and sometimes successful campaigns, keywords are not prioritized. 

* For instance, if you are running a campaign for a local restaurant and use global targeting or too extensive keywords, then you will be experiencing very large costs with fewer relevant local conversions. Likewise, serving ads which don’t appeal to the customer segment of interest can end up with directing a lot of money towards the ads with low conversion rate.

# Higher Bounce Rates

Having mismatched ads cause a high bounce rate to occur when a user clicks an ad hoping for one thing and instead S/he finds something completely different. For instance, a beauty brand that advertises luxury skincare products and directs users to the landing page with affordable skincare products will get a lot of bounce traffic. 

Since there’s no alignment of the ad copy with the information that is found on the landing page, visitors become confused as well as disappointed hence abandoning the page.

Bounce rates are essential to the performance of the ads since it provides the comparison of the quality of the landing page to the expectation created by the ad. 

A high bounce rate can indicate that your ad is not relevant to the page you are leading users to, or the overall user experience is not good, which in any case will decrease the conversion rate.

To avoid high bounce rates, what you promote through ads and what you offer on the pages, should be harmonized in terms of the message and the design. The content on the landing page should present the benefit statement introduced in the ad as soon as the consumer clicks through to the page. 

* For instance, if your ad asks users to order before a particular date, the landing page should guide them on how to order and, at once, notice the expiration date.

# Mismeasure of Actual Performance

Each type of advertisement can become misleading in terms of measuring the results and defining the actual performance of your promotions.

* For example, assume that you already have a very high CTR, but the conversion rate is low, then it means that the ad is attracting the wrong kind of clicks or the message that it sends out about the product is wrong.

 Many times, optimizing for the sole goal of CTR can make marketers feel like everything is going well while, in fact, the targeting is off, the messages are irrelevant, or the ad doesn’t match the landing page.

# Lost Competitive Edge

As observed in competitive market situations, misaligned ads are capable of making the brand fade with its competitors. Your ads may bog down on ill-advised promotions, while your competitors with perfectly-aligned ads will be siphoning away market share more effectively.

 If you have not communicated this clearly, if your message is off, or if you are not getting across to your target market why your product is the better solution, then you are on a road to stagnation.

The chances of giving up an impression to competitors are critical in complex and changing digital landscapes, and continue to affect your business in the long run. 

* For instance, if you are campaigning on a luxury product but failing to inform the right group of consumers or are not advertising the most suitable benefits, then your rivals with a more effectively placed advert will get the consumers you are targeting.

# Increased Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC).

It is very standard practice to end up with an increased cost of acquiring new customers (CAC) when ads are misaligned to each other. The problem with ads is that they may not reach the right audience or maybe they offer the wrong message which makes you pay for clicks that are not customers. 

Therefore, the cost of acquiring a customer rises as it impacts the ROI in a big way. When your ads are wrong in terms of targeting and choice, or they do not meet the needs of the audience, this leads to a high CAC which affects the brand’s fund and profit margin, particularly in the fields with thin margins.

There are also possibilities to tilt the targeting approach and aim at less numerous but more suitable segments, which will also contribute to decreasing CAC. Based on analysis of the customer data and market research, develop profiles of audiences most likely to engage with offers and convert, or buyer personas.

 This is how you optimize your targeting criteria in order to reach out to the users who actually have a potential to make a purchase and make your CACs and ROI less painful.

# Decreased Lifetime Customer Value (LCV)

Offsetting ads can also lead to a reduction in customer lifetime value – the amount of money a customer spends throughout the customers’ and brand’s association. 

If such ads capture the wrong audience, which are people who do not intend to buy your product, each they bring to you will not buy again, hence lowering the overall earnings. Lack of brand congruence with the actual needs and wants of the customers can create ads that turn off customers for the product after the first time purchase rather than cultivating long term consumer loyalty.

To enhance LCV, increase its concentration on customer acquisition and making customers loyal especially on the segmentation that it gives value. Utilize the information on the target within its demographic spending, buying habits, and challenges. 

Design your ads in a way that the clients feel that you are addressing them directly, and show them the benefits of using the product in future. Individualize, as well as, capitalize on points that can get a hold of their worries and stress on aspects that promote its usage repeatedly or to frequently attend to its jurisdictions.

# Missed Revenue Opportunities

In its simplest form, misaligned ad mere is that profitable revenue sources may be lost. When your ads are poorly targeted or give wrong information or hardly grab the attention of the potential consumers, would-be customers will not get to see the offer, or may simply refuse to purchase.

 This leads to lost sales and hence low return on investment or ROI. For instance, an advert which claims to contain one aspect and when clicked, it takes the consumer to another product page lacking that aspect will push people away, thus missing business opportunities.

In general, everyone loves a good success story, which is why you need to ensure that all your objectives in your campaign; the audiences you are targeting and the ads you create as well as the landing pages, are all properly aligned with the utility of your product. 

Strong copy points, effective visuals, and exclusive and irresistible call-to-action that speaks to customers’ and viewers’ emotions. Emphasize on your uniqueness and show the usefulness of your product as directly and briefly as possible.

# The Relationship Between Product Niches and Ad Performance

When it comes to digital advertising, understanding the relationship between product niches and ad performance is critical for optimizing ad campaigns and achieving high ROI. Product niches refer to specific, well-defined segments of the market that a product or service caters to.

 These niches often consist of customers with specialized needs, preferences, or interests, making them distinct from broader market categories. The interplay between product niches and ad performance is significant because it influences targeting, messaging, and overall campaign effectiveness.

Here’s a closer look at how product niches impact ad performance:

# Targeting Precision

The first advantage of opting for the niche product category is the opportunity to refine and aim at customers. They are smaller and more distinct from other larger categories, therefore businesses can create adverts void of much generalization. 

Campaigns can be even more targeted from the demographics, interests and specific behaviors and buying patterns of this particular market segment.

* For example, when you have a business that deals with the sales of organic cleaning products, you get to advertise to them rather than the general population. This precision minimizes the probability of funneling ad spend to individuals that are unlikely to interact or make a purchase.

 On the other hand, universal targeting (e.g. using the message ‘buy all home cleaning products’) may generate less effectiveness and a lower ROI because the viewers are not very precise to the product type.

The objective of proper niche targeting is to enhance the overall ad CTR, conversion rate and, therefore, return on Investment (ROI) values. The more specific the audience is, the closer such people are to the ad and can promptly take some action.

# Ad Messaging and Relevance

When it comes to product niches, the fine connection between ad performance and the degree of match between the ad message and the target audience’s needs, values, and pain points. Strategically, ad messages in niche markets are far easier to develop and fine tuned to appeal to a specific target market. 

This makes it easier to appeal to the audience, and in the process improve the chances of reaping the intended attention.

* For instance, a rich man’s travel agency advertisement will most probably be effective in reaching the audience if it included privileges like private tours and other VIP-like services. 

On the other hand, a commercial advertising travel offers where the tourists are the prime audience will contain messages about the financial aspect of traveling.

There is also an opportunity in niche advertising to call attention to such small selling points as you may have that make your product distinct from the typical rivals.

 Targeted ads that get personal to the needs and wants of the targeted segment can elicit a more favorable response more often than not because of the positive emotional trigger.

#  Cost-Effectiveness

Indeed, advertising in niche markets often helps the brand to save more money because it targets the audience which is smaller, but more defined. Thus, when the ad is targeted sensitively on the particular category of audience, then the competition is comparatively lower than that of competition on broad market segments.

* For instance, targeting vegan skincare products would produce a low bidding price for these keywords in Google AdWords as compared to ‘skincare’ or ‘beauty products.

Furthermore, niche ads are more effective than other common ads because more individuals are likely to click on them. Better conversion rates are often associated with improved cost per acquisition (CPA) and return on ad spend (ROAS) making niche advertising more cost-effective for your business. 

When targeting the right audience, brands can now extend their advertising dollar while still reaping great gains.

# Increased Competition and Niche Saturation

Even though using a product niche allows winning in targeting an ad, it is vital to notice that during this time the niche can become rather oversaturated. Competition becomes stiff within the niche as more and more business ventures improve on their marketing strategies to target such markets.

 It can increase the price for advertising and even worsen the effectiveness of advertising campaigns because several brands compete for the same keywords or some niches of the audience.

As such, the businesses have to come up with ways of creating the more effective ad where they would post high performance or high value level. This might be achieved through better adverts, designing the right offers or providing improved customer services. 

Moreover, constant campaign tweaking and experimenting with new advertisements will enable people to keep advertising their campaigns from getting lost in the sea of advertisements.

#  It focus on the Customer Loyalty and Long Term Values

Niche markets can involve customers with a high level of interest in product/service requirements and characteristics trademarks. 

Due to their passion for the products or services within that niche, it becomes easier to encourage them to become returning customers. Which in turn affects ad performance in the long run in a direct manner.

When a business has set its location and has customers that rely on its services, then satisfying customers will hopefully get others to spread the word from the experience they had. Organic promotion can be used alongside different paid campaigns as an enhancement tool. 

Also, relationships with special customers through ads, retargeting and loyalty programs will thus in the long-run shift the CLV/CAC ratio in a positive trend, specifically towards an improved CLV.

* For instance, a business selling photographic materials and equipments; may find it necessary to continue receiving business from other professionals such as photographers who will in turn recommend their assistants, colleagues and friends among others to the particular business. 

With customized ad and email marketing, the consumers will remain committed to the organization or brand in question so that they keep coming to make purchases hence enhancing the ad performance.

# Ad Platform Selection

Niche campaigns are also affected by the ad platforms where your ads are placed because these platforms determine how your ads are seen by people. Ideal products excel on particular marketplaces which are frequented by the target demographic. 

* For instance, Pinterest and Instagram are mostly preferred by lifestyle, apparel & cosmetics, and home décor product categories, and thus optimal for niche specific categories in those sectors.

LinkedIn may be well applied for the business to business specialized niche market sectors like business consulting or explicit software solutions. The demographics of your niche target market is vital in determining in which platforms your advertising money should be invested. 

Advertising on the right site guarantees interaction and improved outcomes as compared to other media because the targets are normally achieved.

Moreover, it is also important to state that there may be a difference of the types of ads that work in a certain niche depending on the platform that the niche is being targeted at. 

* For instance, [video ads](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-use-amazon-video-ads-to-boost-your-amazon-sales-in-2024/) may prove useful on YouTube as well as Instagram while carousel ads could be useful for e-commerce stores targeting niche whispers. In targeting the customers the right ad format should be adopted based on the preferences of the target group.

# Scalability Challenges

Although its benefits focus on the target niche market where the brand enjoys a high degree of personalization and cost efficiency, the problem associated with it is the ability of the brand to expand its advertising campaign.

 Certainly, the scale of the specific customer segment can hold back the amount of traffic or conversion a brand can generate. If the niche is too narrow, the ad performance may very well reach saturation and may not be able to grow beyond this point without increasing the target market.

Cutting down the ad campaign type to the extent of making it into a niche one requires some pass-through. Brands can increase their niche by targeting the audience with a very similar need or introducing related commodities, or by entering into a related niche market. 

* For instance, a brand that deals in organic skincare products with interests in sensitive skin could extend its marketing campaign based on the theme of eco-tar, though they still majors on sensitive skin.

Still, the excessive expansion of the lists, with several related interests each containing many specialties, might hurt the targeting accuracy and ad effectiveness. 

The challenge often faced is how to balance the niche targeting approach and the scalability of the campaign so that ad performance is sustained when the business expands.

#  The Effects of Ad Fatigue on Audience Participation

In niche markets, the target audience is fewer, which implies that after the same users viewed the same advert multiple times, the advert fatigue is likely to occur. With time, the attitude towards the same ads changes, and the return rate is thus low, making them ineffective.

 This may subsequently lower CTR while raising the CPC due to consumers becoming bored with the message that is being passed across to them.

One is to ensure that the number of ads one uses is changed regularly so that potential consumers do not get tired of seeing the same ads over and over. 

It is possible to alternate the ads with fresh offers, with a focus on other characteristics of products, or with the help of a change of the season, which will keep the audience interested in the advertisements. 

Further, using the cu content or bringing in and sharing the cu testimonials or collaborating with influencers is good to bring new ideas and the audience’s engagement.

# Enhancing Amazon Advertising through Product-Specific Ads

Amazon Ads are one of the best strategies for increasing traffic and sales on the platform but the problem with so many customers and competitors is often how to make your ads pop. 

Apparently, there exists a growth opportunity in **Amazon FBA** advertising that may ultimately enhance return on investment (ROI) and the possibility is realized through the use of product-specific ads.

 That is why, by selecting specific products, their specific characteristics, and target consumers, you can make your Amazon ads more relevant, effective and, therefore, increase your sales. Here’s how to improve your Amazon Ads with product-centric campaigns:

# Understand the Product’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

The initial process where you have the product at the core of your campaign is to analyze the specific message that each product offers to its consumers. Every product has a competitive advantage and it doesn’t matter if it pertains to the quality, price, features or smooth design. 

By identifying and thus pointing at this USP, you can generate top-notch and engaging ads that would cause the attention of the potential customers.

* For instance, if you are promoting a skincare cream, which comes for sale with a relatively higher price compared to others in the market, the cream’s USP has to be that it is made of natural substances that do not contain parabens or chemicals. 
* For example, when you had your product-centric advertisement, you could have closely lined this feature and made consumers conscious by letting them know that the product was environmentally friendly and free from chemicals. 

It follows therefore that by positioning the product’s attributes in close proximity to the needs of the consumer you end up with an ad that targets a specific segment of the market.

# Take advantage of Targeting Options on Amazon

With the world’s largest marketplace, you can advertise products, particular categories, or even a direct competitor. With product targeting, you are guaranteed that your ad will be shown at the exact time users are searching products in related categories to your product. 

This is a good chance to intercept high intent traffic as shoppers are already in a purchase frame of mind.

* For instance, if you are selling a collection of professional iron-encrusted kitchen utensils, you can reach out to users that are browsing through rival steel utensils brands. When you emphasize such things with your item—its wearing resistance, clean ability, or appropriateness for induction cooktops—that means you provide a better option for clients who are willing to buy.

Product-oriented advertising campaigns are most effective when this equation runs on the concept ‘my product is better in some way than most of the competitors’ or ‘this aspect of my product is better.’

# Make Highly Specific Keywords Every Product

Another major factor when considering the **Amazon FBA** ad campaign is keyword targeting. Do not use very generic keywords such as shoes, coffee or whatever you are selling, use the specific, descriptive and detailed keywords. 

The product specific campaigns should also focus on the specialty of your product since this is likely to pull in customers that are in the market for that particular product.

* For instance, if you are selling a portable blender targeted for athletes, it is better to type in keywords such as ‘portable blender for smooth making’ or ‘blender for athletes’ rather than ‘blender’. These specific keywords will help your ad to appear in front of the desired user’s search results that are interested in purchasing these products, allowing to reach the audience that can instantly convert.

When you target the specific product, you ensure your ad is more relevant and liked therefore improving your Quality Score thus avoiding spending money on low converting searches.

#  Maximizing the Product Listings for Advertising Compatibility

In a product-specific Amazon ad format, the association of the ad with the product’s listing is especially crucial. Whenever an ad is effective enough to compel a customer to click, they should be redirected to your product detail page where the listing has to be persuasive enough to support the ad message. 

If an ad comes with a promise that a particular product is on offer while in the product page, there is a different product offered, then it results in high bounce rates in addition to wasting the advertising money as well as potential sales.

Ensure that your product listing pages are in sync with the message you want to pass in your ads. The title of the product, the bullet points, the description and the **listing images** should be closely related to the ad text and should refer only to the benefits of the product.

 If your ad focuses on the environmental friendliness of your product, for instance, make sure the product’s page highlights the environmental-friendliness of your product.

Of course, providing clear and high-resolution images, and videos, where your product is presented in action is significant as well.

 Product focused campaigns are most effective when the ad encounter is superior, in the sense that from the point the consumer clicks on the ad, the subsequent process leading up to a purchase decision is eased.

# Utilise Sponsored Products and Sponsored Brands

There are several ad formats available on Amazon FBA : however, for the product-based campaigns, Sponsored Products and the newer [Sponsored Brands](https://www.amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-sponsored-brands-ads-a-quick-tutorial/) are optimal.

Sponsored Products are targeted by keywords and make up paid ads that can be found in the actual search results pages and the product pages. 

They are useful in the advertisement of single items. As all these ads appear on product listing and search results, these ads can result in direct conversions since they target clients with a high inclination towards purchasing.

Sponsored Brands enables you to advertise within **Amazon FBA** several products, in your brand, on the search results or product detail page. The main idea of this ad format is more broad than others, but it can be a campaign about a specific category or a set of products even within this format. 

It also assists in the branding process as well as marketing of specific products in the marketplace. Both of the ad formats allow the user to employ targeting options like keyword targeting, product targeting, target audience targeting to reach the potential while increasing probabilities of conversions.

# Measure and Manage High Volume Products

You will not find that every product you have in your catalog is perfectly performed to the optimum effect. In order to optimize every product based campaign, one should focus on the promotion of the products that may be expected to deliver high results on the cost of advertising (ROAS).

 Go to your sales, examine each product and find those articles that have the highest turnover rate, the greatest margin and amazing customer feedback.

In this way, you guarantee that most of the money spent on advertising goes to products that give better chances of success. Further, applied to these high priority products, you can more effectively fine tune your targeting and marketing communications message to the potential customer.

# Make use of Dynamic Creative Optimization or DCO.

Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) is the feature in which you can design and compare several different ads. It requires less production time than filming a new advert and because it always revolves around products it can be tweaked to highlight a different feature of the product or target a different audience.

* For instance, one version of an ad can be about your product’s features, and the other can be about pricing strategies, and then you would compare the results for particular audiences.

**Amazon FBA** ’s dynamic ad solutions allow you to define creatives based on the KPIs you’re aiming for, so your product-focused ads are always getting better.

Explore The Lofton's blog that covers the 10 most enchanting wedding venues near Florence, with a focus on what makes this area special and what to consider when planning:

* Florence sits along the Tennessee River in Alabama's northwestern corner, where the musical heritage of ""The Shoals"" adds something special to celebrations
* The area offers everything from historic mansions with Southern charm to rustic barns with countryside views
* Many couples don't realize that expanding their search just a bit (like to nearby Tennessee) opens up venue options with completely different vibes
* Weather patterns vary significantly by season, with spring bringing wildflowers but frequent rain, while fall offers perfect temperatures and clearer skies
* The Lofton is just 1hr 20min from Florence in Ardmore, TN, where we offer weekend-long celebrations instead of just a single day

One thing we've learned is that many couples initially search for a typical ""wedding day"" venue but end up preferring the idea of a **full weekend celebration** where family and friends can really connect. ✨

 When you have from Thursday to Sunday instead of just 6-8 hours on Saturday, those unplanned moments often become favorite memories - like friends gathering around a fire pit sharing stories the night before, or a quiet morning coffee on the porch watching the sunrise over the meadows.

1jlztxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1jlztxa/what_happens_when_small_town_high_schoolers_go_to/,What happens when small town high schoolers go to see a movie - Part 1,"Names have been changed to protect the shitheads.

One night in the late ‘90s my high school friend group and I decided to see Starship Troopers in the theater. It was a simple enough plan. Sam would drive us in the Blue Bomber, an ‘80s Ford that was the naval destroyer of pickup trucks. It was big and loud, with heavy chrome bumpers, used tires, and that classic old truck smell no other vehicle can have.

For the occasion we decided to put the Bomber in “Pimp Mode."" This meant installing the camper shell, putting a slab of carpet in the bed, adding two bean bag chairs and one mini mirror ball, and piling in four or five rabid hyenas (high school guys).
 
I, being best friends with Sam, had claimed the bench seat in the cab, along with my younger brother. But since the bed had no seat belts or safety restraints of any kind (men were men back then), the hyena pack was rollicking around in the back being your typical 16 and 17-year-olds.
 
The theater was 15 miles away. But first, one stop was needed to pick up Fred, another one of the hyenas. Fred lived on a narrow, twisty, shoulderless road that came off the freeway, went through a dark section of forest, then back onto the freeway. On one side of this road was a dirt embankment, on the other side was a steep slope that dropped off into the darkness. The tree canopy formed a narrow tunnel lit only by our headlights. Navigating this road in the Blue Bomber with its long-stick manual transmission was rough, and it began to take its toll on Sam. 

To make things worse, the next day was garbage day, and every homeowner had pushed their garbage bins up onto the street. So aside from Sam constantly shifting, steering, accelerating up hills and braking down grades, he was avoiding green garbage bins every eight seconds.
 
For a normal adult, these driving conditions are par for the course. For your average 17 year old, it was torture. Sam was patient, but his frustration was quietly building.
 
Finally, after about the 30th garbage bin, Sam seemed to decide he was working too hard. I noticed a sudden calm that was oddly alarming. The hyena pack noticed it too, and became silent. As the next garbage bin came up around the corner, Sam didn’t evade. He didn’t brake or shift. He just accelerated.
 
BOOM. The bin bounced off the chrome front bumper with the sound of an M-80, sending a week’s worth of garbage 40 feet in the air. It rocketed like a ping pong ball back down its driveway, crashing out of sight as plastic bags and used coffee filters fluttered down onto the street. The hyena pack let out a howl, and Sam chuckled with glee. The Bomber sped on through the night.

This atrocious, regrettable act of irresponsibility only happened two or three more times at the most, but somehow the drive seemed much less stressful for everyone. The next morning, as a handful of undeserving homeowners got ready for the day and pulled up their driveways, they undoubtedly paused in shock and horror, taking a moment to curse teenage drivers everywhere for being uncaring, reckless and dangerous. And they weren’t wrong.

Stopping to get Fred had put us a little behind schedule, so once the guffawing had settled down, people started to anticipate getting to the theater on time. We were back on the freeway, but we still had about 10 miles to go. The speed limit was 65, and the movie started in 12 minutes. So we should be fine… right?

1jlzrm4,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1jlzrm4/guide_for_nonmono_ingredient_pokemon_that_are/,Guide for Non-mono ingredient Pokemon that are safe to power up,"I spent some time this morning (admittedly too much time) going over all the current top 4 strongest dishes of each type and looking over which Pokemon could handle their needs without being AAA.

All of these pokemon were checked via [Raenonx product comparison tool](https://pks.raenonx.cc/en/production) at lvl 60 with just IFM subskill and neutral nature. Any better stats are much safer to use.

KEEP IN MIND! RNG is RNG and can definitely screw you from time to time. The better the subskills/nature of your pokemon the more likely it will be well past the requirements for the largest dish. AAA is always better for getting what you want but you may find that it's overkill and a non-mono can easily take the place and sometimes make it so you only need 2-3 pokemon for a dish instead of 4.

**Safe to Use**: The following pokemon can safely cover 3x of their ingredient requirements for the largest dish

**Sausage**: Bewear ABB (97 sausage, 12 corn) Max needed is 84

**Milk**: Meowscarda ABB (84 milk, 11 potato) Max needed is 78

**Tomato**: Venusaur ABB (82 tomato, 14 honey)  Max needed 75

**Ginger**: Comfey ABB (74 ginger, 10 corn) or Tyranitar ABA (70 ginger, 39 soy). Max needed 60. *Note: You may want to invest instead in an ABB Tyranitar for Soy.*

**Soybeans**: Tyranitar ABB (100 soy, 15 ginger) Max needed 84

**Oil**: Luxray ABB (73 oil, 13 tomato) Max needed 66

**Corn**: Dragonite ABB \[NOT RECOMMENDED\] (89 corn, 16 herb) or Bewear ABA (56 corn, 38 sausage) Max needed 54. *Note: You will want to use an AAA Dragonite for herbs instead.*

**Risky Use:** The following pokemon will need more than a single IF+ to get over their maximum ingredient count requirement for the day. All but Gengar can do with also having HSM. Gengar would need IF+ nature to cover.

**Honey**: Pinsir ABA (60 honey, 33 apple) - Max needed 66

**Mushroom**: Gengar ABB (57 mushroom, 11 herb) - Max needed 66. *Note: Even AAA Quagsire only gives 63 mushrooms with these stats.*

**Egg**: Abomasnow ABB (73 egg, 13 tomato) - Max needed 75

**Fiery Herb**: Dragonite ABA (73 herb, 32 corn) - Max needed 81

**Leek**: Quaquaval ABB (45 leek, 15 soy) Max needed 60. *Note: Quaquaval won't cover the highest recipe 3x/day but it is the fastest leek farmer as ABB.*

**Tail**: Ditto ABC (13 tail, 13 leek, 9 oil) Max needed 30. *Note: None of the top recipes need tail and Ditto is the fastest farmer but won't cover the highest need 3x/day. IMO not worth focusing on).*

**REQUIRES AAA**: These ingredients require AAA pokemon to cover the largest dish 3x/day.

**Apple**: Skeledirge (110 apples), runner up Pinsir ABB (88 apple, 13 honey) Max needed 105

**Coffee**: Vikavolt (78 coffee and will not cover the highest dish x3) Max needed 84

**Cacao**: Clodsire (70 cacao and will not cover highest dish x3) Max needed 90. *Note: Clodsire can cover the max amount but it needs VERY good subskills and nature IFM, HSM, and IF+ will do.*

**Special note: Corn**: Corn is an odd one as Dragonite ABB and Bewear ABA can both cover the max needed but you may want to use them for ginger or herbs. Comfey AAA can also cover it but you may use that for Tyranitar ABA instead. In the end it's your choice. I'll say that using Dragonite isn't ideal as it's by FAR the best herb farmer an takes much more effort to power up.

Hey everyone,

I’ve been struggling with GERD for a while and dealing with some frustrating side effects—constant belching, brain fog, and headaches, especially in the morning. It feels like my acid reflux isn’t just affecting my stomach but also messing with my head. My mind feels foggy, and I just feel off. 

I usually take Pepcid before a heavy meal, but once I start eating trigger foods, I tend to go overboard. That leads to me taking Pepcid for multiple days in a row. When I finally stop, the reflux comes back with a vengeance.

My doctors are clueless and Prilosec and nexium do nothing for me:(

Lately, I’ve been trying to manage it by sticking to reflux-friendly foods (oatmeal, lean proteins, non-acidic veggies), drinking more water, and avoiding triggers like coffee and spicy foods.

Has anyone else experienced this? What has helped you? Have antihistamines, Tylenol, or anything else worked for you? I’d love to hear your experiences and any tips that might help!

1jlzlkb,https://i.redd.it/5qcl7tkvmgre1.jpeg,Chargeback for no listed ammenities at hotel.,"Am i right in thinking that i am eligible to put in a chargeback for an issue i had with a hotel in the US recently?

I booked through Booking.com very last minute because i was going to stay at a friends place and they had an issue with water so even they had to move out.

On the hotel page it said specifically Free parking & Fitness centre. 

The hotel charges a resort fee per stay which was $20 a night, which i had to pay. This was nowhere to be seen on the checkout or pre-checkout page, i just did another test run on the same hotel and it clearly shows price including taxes. If there was a resort fee normally it would show a ""due at property"" or ""resort fee"" segregated. Nothing.

The resort fee essentially covers the parking, and ""free"" filter coffee from the lobby. Which basically means you're paying an extra $20, even if you do or dont have a car? And that's how they got away with listing as free parking when clearly it isnt.

To top it off, there was no gym/fitness center whatsoever, not that its undergoing refurbishment or anything. They have never had a gym on the property, ever.

Ended up paying $60 extra out of pocket and literally went to a hotel without the 1 ammenity i wanted, when it was clearly listed it was there.

Now if i had called up the hotel to check all this through, i probably would have gotten all the answers beforehand and booked somewhere else. But if im booking through a 3rd party (travel agent) and their page for the hotel says it has free parking and a gym, I'm genuinely not going to assume they're making it up. i shouldn't have to call an international number to another country to check that they aren't lying, right? 

Booking.com are saying the resort fee covered the parking, which is then considered free, but im saying you didnt even tell me i had to pay this resort fee when i booked? Didn't even reply to my comment about there being no gym there",6,1743180592.0,AmexUK,9,0.87,False

With general timeline and price breakdown.,"My husband and I eloped in Mobile, AL on 3/22. We live in a very small town in Mississippi and after doing some research about Mobile online, we thought it would be a good place for us to celebrate and for our families to come together (our families live in SC and TN). Our goal was to have very chill and intimate elopement weekend, so I wanted to share a little bit about our experience!

***Timeline***

**Thursday**: Arrived to Mobile around 3 PM. Had dinner with my mother and grandmother, who had arrived earlier than the rest of our families.

**Friday**: We grabbed some pastries and coffee for breakfast and walked around downtown Fairhope, AL. Came back to Mobile for some lunch. In the evening, we had a dinner/hangout with our families at a local brewery.

**Saturday** (""Wedding day""): We went to the library to get our marriage certificate notarized then split up to spend time with our families. We met back up in the afternoon for family/couple photos with our photographer at the Federal Courthouse. Drove to Fairhope, AL for more photos with our photographer then had a celebratory dinner with our families! Total guest count was 15 people including my husband and me. We wanted to keep it small and intimate and it was perfect.

**Sunday**: We had breakfast with my family and then had lunch with his! We left town after having lunch with his family.

***Price Breakdown***

**Wedding bands:** $851.47

**Makeup/hair**: I spent $255.20 at Ulta (mostly on makeup products) and did my hair and makeup myself! I have had my hair and makeup done professionally before and was not happy with it, so I wanted to do them myself so that I felt and looked like myself on our day. I watched YouTube videos and did some research on products. Edited to add that I wear **very** minimal makeup on a daily basis, so I purchased a lot of products that some people may already have.

**Bride**: Dress: $88, Earrings: $38, Shoes: $110

**Groom**: Already owned everything except the tie. Cost of his tie is unknown.

**Cake**: $150

**Flowers**: $150 for bouquet and boutonniere.

**Airbnb (3 nights)**: $550

**Marriage certificate fees**: $76 ($73 to record + $3 for copy)

**Photography**: $2500. We did not do engagement photos, so we splurged here. Our photographer's name is Katie Bertagnolli and we absolutely loved her!

**Celebratory dinner for 15 people**: $1200 minimum. My family paid for this meal, so I am unsure of the total amount.

**Total**: $5968.67. Total does not include gas, meal on Friday (his family paid), other meals during trip, etc. Overall, we are very happy with how it went and are very fortunate our families were able to contribute. We felt as though it was a very intimate celebration. We appreciated being able to spend time with our families one on one and also in a group setting. We also realize that asking our families to travel for an elopement is a lot to ask, but with all of us spread out over 3 different states, travel was inevitable and this is what worked best for us!

[PREVIOUS PART](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorObscura/comments/1jkd2l2/the_polzeig_experience_part_one/)

Despite my aches and pains, I had no problem sleeping that night. There were dreams again, but this time they were vivid and memorable. They were filled with distorted images of a grand staircase descending into the unknown, walls bending inward, and open doors leading to revealed nothing but shadows. But one hallway drew me in, its yellow curtains swaying lazily. With each step further down the hall, the curtains moved and rippled more, and I began to hear a humming that came from either behind the veil of fabric or perhaps the fabric itself. I couldn't resist the urge to reach out and touch the curtains; the material was damp and warm to the touch. Strange yet familiar symbols flitted out from where my fingers had brushed the fabric. The static music rose up, filling my mind with names from the lost cards of the Old Deck - Zyvrathul, Grythar, Vyraska, Astrylith.

Finally, inevitably, the hallway brought me to a dead-end alcove. That was where Marvin was waiting for me. He sat at a table with a revolver in his hand.

“What are you doing here?” I asked.

“Waiting for you,” he answered.

“Why did you do it?”

He placed the revolver to his head, “Because I won.”

Mercifully, I woke up before he pulled the trigger.

At around ten in the morning, an Attendant delivered me a paper plate covered with warm Eggo waffles and a cup of tepid water. When I asked for seconds of both, they happily brought them to me. Six hours later, I was brought a thermos of coffee, a bag lunch containing a sandwich, and an apple. I asked if there was anything to read, and they brought me Volume 71 of Reader’s Digest condensed books. It was all I needed to pass the time until sunset.

I was almost finished with the first book in the volume when the Attendant came to fetch me. This time when I entered the Yellow Tent, I was given a square of paper and a miniature pencil. One side of the paper was a tally of my baccarat winnings, the other was blank. I ended up standing in line next to the Self-Made Millionaire. “All this… nonsense,” he said. “The Old Deck is in the hands of a lunatic.”

“What’s left of the Old Deck, you mean,” someone else commented.

I kept my silence; there were Attendants everywhere, and I knew one of them must have heard. Let someone else find visitors in their trailer tonight.

And besides, in all my studies about the Old Deck, I’d never heard of a single innocent or rational soul having it in their possession. The previous owner of the Old Deck had been a ruthless harridan who made her fortune in real estate and was supposedly secretly involved in the death of Evelyn McHale and the establishment of the National Prayer Breakfast.

It was open seating in the Yellow Tent. I chose the third row of the right corner and settled in, the pencil and paper resting on one knee. This time the suit depicted hanging over the stage depicted two symbolic figures intertwined in an otherworldly dance. This was the ninth card of the Old Deck, the sign of the Tearer of Realms.

The Mistress of Ceremonies stepped onto the stage and instructed us that we would be given three minutes to make our choice, and then the slips of paper and pencils would be collected. She further explained that we could either bet nothing at all, all our winnings, or Wager for the Deck. We were also instructed to mark down our competitor of choice as clearly as possible. Then she clapped her hands twice, and six of the Attendants filed out onto the stage, each wearing a medallion with a number around their chest.

I thought of the Owner of a Regional Supermarket Chain and the other losers from last night, their fortunes lost and their futures uncertain. I imagined them traveling home, both disappointed and relieved to have been spared this choice.

*Nothing at all. All my winnings. Wager for the Deck.*

What would the others be deciding for? I was sure the majority would choose the first option. Some had already lost enough. Some had won enough. And I am sure a select few just wanted to see the grotesquerie to follow.

But undoubtedly greed would drive a number of the people seated around me to risk all their winnings for the chance of an 80% payout.

Only a few of us would be mad enough to Wager for the Deck.

That decision had already been made for me; it had been made for me the day I received Marvin’s posthumous letter. All I had to worry over was which of the six Attendants to choose. I stared at each of them, trying to guess who the winner would be, and was immediately frustrated. When it came to Baccarat, I had my wits and skill to get me ahead, but now all I had to rely on was luck, and as you know, I am no fan of luck.

It was then that I noticed that Attendant number five was the broken-nosed one. After a moment’s consideration, I wrote their number down. After three minutes had passed, Attendants began to file through the rows of seats and collect our bets

They made us wait a little longer before the Mistress of Ceremonies began to walk back and forth so everyone could get a good look at the revolver she was holding. She inserted five bullets into the cylinder and gave it a spin before clicking it firmly shut.

The Attendants began to sing, six dry voices keening as one, *“Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound. That saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now am found was blind but now I see-”*

BLAM!

We all flinched in our seats at the sound. Attendant One crumpled to the floor, a smoldering wound in the back of their head. The Mistress of Ceremonies moved on to the next.

*“T’was Grace that taught my heart to fear. And Grace, my fears relieved. How precious did that grace appear. The hour I first believed-“*

BLAM!

Attendant Two made a tiny gulping sound and pitched forward. The Mistress of Ceremonies moved on.

*“Through many dangers, toils and snares I have already come; 'Tis Grace that brought me safe thus far and Grace will lead me home-”*

BLAM!

Down went Attendant Three. We had grown used the sound now. Some of the audience leaned forward in their seats, eager and terrified, others slumped back, their posture and expression betraying the depths of their loss.

*“The Lord has promised good to me. His word my hope secures. He will my shield and portion be. As long as life endures-”*

BLAM!

Attendant Four dropped. A commotion broke out in the audience as the Smug High-Ranking Official tried to make a run for it. He went down in a swarm of black tuxedos and grasping liver-spotted hands.

*“Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail. And mortal life shall cease. I shall possess within the veil. A life of joy and peace-”*

Click.

An audible gasp went through us all. The Mistress of Ceremonies stepped over to the last of the Attendants.

*“When we've been here ten thousand years. Bright shining as the sun. We've no less days to sing God's praise. Then when we've first begun.”*

BLAM!

The sixth Attendant dropped. The game ended.

**Section Five**

I spent most of the next day relaxing and watching from my window as most of the guests of the Poelzig Experience left their trailers and headed home. I made a game of it, trying to guess by their posture and gait if they were leaving empty-handed or richer than before. The ones like me, the ones that had Wagered for the Deck and won were waiting for sunset, sitting in our trailers with bonbons and champagne.

And as for the ones that had wagered and lost? Their screams had been audible all morning but by my fifth glass of champagne, I had lost interest in such considerations. Time passed slowly and pleasantly, until sometime after lunch I laid my spinning head down on my pillow and imagined what Marvin had been doing at this point in the Experience. Had been drunk and relived like me or had he been worried? Was he still trying to decide what his winnings would be or did he know what he wanted? Had he wished I was there?

As I drifted off to sleep I remembered our last conversation. I’d asked him why he’d stopped gambling and he’d said, “We never had a chance. All that waits is the Screaming Nowhere at the heart of the Engines of Creation.”

The knock on my door woke me up, it was time. The Attendant that greeted me was unfamiliar, they offered me a friendly grin. I asked the for a cigarette, of course, they had one. I enjoyed it, taking my time as they led me to the Yellow Tent. I found myself at the end of the line, which was exactly where I wanted to be. I found myself standing next to the Well-Dressed Movie Star. “You made it,” he said, his voice emotionless.

“Excited?” I made a quick count of who was left. There were eleven in all, eleven mad fools waiting for a chance to take control of the Engines of Creation, if only for a moment. No one had been allowed in yet.

“I just…” he glanced over to the side of the old barn where a trio of Attendants were hard at work digging a deep trench into the ground. Despite the dirt and the sweaty labor they still had their tuxedos on. The bodies of Attendants One, Two, Three, Four, and Six were lying nearby. “I just want this to be over.”

“Losing your nerve?” I asked.

“I could lose everything.”

And that was true. The first of us was ushered inside, I didn’t recognize the player and when they left the tent some time later they were cracking with joy. “Mine mine mine!” they shouted to the stars. The next player was ushered inside and it continued. It wasn’t until the third player entered the tent that we heard a scream. A few minutes later, a lifeless body was brought out; it was the Self-Made Millionaire, still dripping with blood as they were unceremoniously deposited into the freshly dug trench.

It took over two hours for the line to simply reach its halfway point but that was to be expected. After all, there was only one Deck, there was only one Charles Poelzig and unlike previous holders of the Old Deck, he wanted to play each game personally.

When it was the Well-Dressed Movie Star's turn, six out of the eleven among us had already been placed in the trench. It was impossible not to observe that one of them had been feebly struggling as they were thrown in.

He turned to me as one of the Attendants took him by the elbow, “Pray for me.”

And I had to laugh, how could anyone hope for a merciful God at a time like this?

The minutes ticked by, and uncertainty hung heavy in the air. I wondered to myself how many of the people who had come here truly understood what the Old Deck was, who understood that each card represented a being described in the Nine Rebel Sermons as *”Exalted beyond the realm of mortals, yet humbled by mortal frailty, bearing an essence both divine and earthly.”*

When the Smartly-Dressed Movie Star left the tent thirty minutes later his head was held high. He flashed me a grin, “If you make it out call me.”

Then it was my turn.

I entered the tent to see the only table left standing was the one Charles Poelzig had chosen to sit at, and two chairs were placed on either side of it. The flagpole and its fan stood undisturbed. A new flag hung from it and upon the green fabric was the image of a series of overlapping, enigmatic symbols that brought to mind the image of something being torn apart. This was the suit of the Devourer of Visions the tenth card of the Old Deck In front of it were the five defeated players from last night’s game, heads shaven and mouths wired shut. They all had knives in their hands and their brand-new tuxedos were stained with the blood of the gamblers sent to the trench outside.

Near the opposite side of tent Attendant #5 sat on a makeshift throne made from three chairs stacked atop one another. They wore a paper crown on their head and ill-filling clothes that had been salvaged from one of the new Attendants. There was a metal briefcase on their lap. There was a look in their eyes that made me think of the expression a prisoner must have after being released from a long sentence.

With every step I took closer to Charles Poelzig the louder the sound of machinery became, the grinding metal being worked by a thousand gears and motors. A taste like rust filled my mouth. It was loudest when I took my seat, even now I couldn’t tell you if the sound was coming from beneath him or from him.

He glanced up from shuffling the seven remaining cards of the Old Deck. They were made of copper, and the faces of each held a symbol from a witch language birthed in the Screaming Nowhere. On the back of each was the sign of Ezerhodden. “You want the cards?” He asked.

“Why else would I be here?” I said.

The five freshly anointed Attendants moved to stand behind me, their knives at the ready. Poelzig smiled at me, “You were Marvin Greene’s lover.”

“Marvin’s dead.”

“Suicide,” Poelzig said, “Icarus flying too close to the sun.”

“What was his prize?” I asked.

“He’s dead. Does it matter?”

I said, “It matters to me.”

Poelzeg shook his head derisively, “Is that why you’re here? All this just to win an answer to a silly little question?”

“That’s not what I want, but I’d like to know just the same.”

He waved my question away and began to shuffle the Old Deck again. “The rules are this, I draw a card, you draw a card. The higher card wins the round. You keep your card and we begin again until the cards are gone. You win you get our prize. You lose…” he pointed to the Attendants, “and they get you.”

The absurdity was almost too much to bear, the simplest of games turned into a matter of life and death. I watched his hands as they cut and recut the deck, I knew the tricks for stacking a deck. It looked like he was playing fair.

Poelzeg set the deck down between us, “I’ll begin.”

He drew the top card uncovering a divided shape that looked like two faces connected at the center, perfectly reflecting each other. This was the fifth suit of the Old Deck, the sign of Korvylar, the Void-Harbinger.

My draw was next, the card felt cold and metallic to the touch. My fingertips tingled after I set it down, exposing a jagged, circular glyph an insectile eye. This was the first card, Zyvrathul- the Veilweaver. It was early in the game but I still felt a tremor of fear, not the fear of dying but the fear of losing.

My expression must have been obvious because Poelzig began to smirk. “Too late to turn back now.”

“I wouldn’t miss this for the world,” I said. “Tell me what he asked for.”

“Do you think it will help you?” He selected his next card from the top of the deck. It was Xyrlith, the Abbess of Murmurs, the second suit symbolized as a fluid angular mouth-like symbol.

“Are you afraid to tell me?”

Poelzeg tapped the deck, “Draw or default.”

My card was the sixth suit, Thranok, the Desolate Conflux, a series of concentric circles, each containing an arcane spiral.

“An even score in the second round,” he said. “A rarity.”

“How was Marvin doing at this point?”

He chuckled, “Are you always this tenacious? No wonder you’ve come from such a lowly background to make such a fortune.”

That stung a little, I stung back. “We can’t all inherit our wealth. Such a tragedy your parents died so young.”

Despite the provocation his voice softened, “He was winning by now, a score of thirteen.”

That was Marvin all right. Always lucky until he wasn’t. “What did he ask for?”

Poelzeg smiled wickedly, “His third card.”

I mirrored his smile, “His prize. What was his prize? Maybe I want the same thing.”

“Oh,” he laughed, “I doubt that.”

“Why?”

Rather than responding, he proceeded to draw his next card, unveiling the eleventh suit known as Drak'mor, the Abyssal Chariot. This card depicted a cosmic wheel with galaxies arranged as spokes. “Oh dear. That’s eighteen to seven.”

There were only two cards left, the fourth and twelfth suit. One life and one death. My hand hovered over the deck but I dropped it back,  “What did he want?”

He threw up his arms, “If I tell you will you finish the game?”

I nodded. The sooner this was over the better.

Poelzeg leaned in conspiratorially, “He wanted to know always know the odds.”

“The odds?” I said, “That’s all?”

He nodded solemnly. ""And that is precisely what he received - complete and utter revelation. He knew the result of every coin flip, dice roll, and outcome you could imagine.”

I heard Marvin’s voice in my head, louder than the hum of the fans, louder than the rustling of the flag, louder even than the impossible machine-like roar that churned around us.

“We never had a chance. All that waits is the Screaming Nowhere at the heart of the Engines of Creation.”

I drew my final card, Sylthara Who Bleeds at the Threshold, a line, a cross, and a curve that somehow resolved itself into a peculiar and human-like shape. The twelfth card.

And just like that, I had won. Visibly disappointed, the new Attendants slunk back to the other side of the room. Poelzeg stared at me with amusement.

“Lucky, lucky. Must be how you survived in the entertainment industry.” He waited for retaliation, but I simply looked away and turned over the last card of the deck to reveal the fourth suit of the Old Deck - Ithryndra, the Conduit of Divine Grace.

""I was supposed to do that,"" Poelzeg remarked.

Leaning forward, I added, ""They say Ithyranda’s followers gain the gift of immortality.""

His eyes sparked with interest. ""Is that what you desire?""

Resting my hand on my chin, I pretended to ponder. ""It depends on the true meaning of immortality.""

Poelzeg huffed, ""Immortality means immortality.""

""You must be aware of the drawbacks,"" I pressed, a note of accusation creeping into my words.

""I can’t say.""

""Can't or won't?"" I inquired.

Poelzeg's smile wavered. ""What are you going on about? Claim your prize.""

""Marvin loved to cheat,"" I explained, ""cheat at cards, cheat at business, he even cheated on me.""

Poelzeg snorted, ""I can't imagine why.""

""He believed his Prize would make everything easy, but he received more than that, didn't he?"" I continued. ""You mentioned that he saw everything, every possible outcome. He didn't just know the result of each poker hand; he knew the odds of the dealer getting cancer, of the player next to him cheating on their spouse. He couldn't even walk down the street without knowing the probability of the man on the sidewalk turning left or right.""

""So?"" I persisted, my voice unwavering.

Poelzeg sighed, ""So what?""

""You could have warned him, but it amused you not to,"" I accused. ""What will happen to the others who played tonight?"" I inquired.

""I've answered enough questions,"" Poelzeg replied.

I leaned back in my seat, contemplating immortality, wealth, forbidden wisdom, and hidden worlds. I had the power to choose anything I desired.

But then, memories of that fateful night in Singapore flooded my mind.

Poelzeg's eyes narrowed, his patience running thin. ""What. Is. Your. Prize?""

A smile spread across my face.

*Section Six*

When it was over, I sat alone at the table with the Old Deck. The sounds of the Engines of Creation were fading now. I wondered what the Old Deck had originally been meant to do. What strange alchemy had it been meant to work? Surely nothing like the Poelzeg Experience. Even the Nine Rebel Sermons had been unclear on that point, only saying that *”Each disciple of Ezerhodden reverently received their sacred card, clutching it tightly to their bosom, and embarked upon a solemn pilgrimage into the Verge to smite the children of Mazzikin…”*

I began to shuffle the deck; there was something about the feel of those cards in your hand that made you have to shuffle them. And with each motion of my fingers, the sensation became more pleasurable. In my mind's eye, I saw how each of the missing cards had been destroyed: the first during a clandestine gathering of scholars in an ancient library, the second during a midnight ritual in a desolate cemetery during the 17th century, the third during the 19th-century Arctic expedition led by Captain John Franklin during a desperate performance of the Rite of Edgagor, and the fifth lost in the ruins of Tunguska. I saw the Old Deck travel the world, from a temple shrine in the Babylonian city of Kish to the bedside of Cesare Borgia to the offices of Charles Poelzeg.

Then I looked up and saw the woman in the green dress standing before me. Up close, I could see the thick pancake makeup, rouge, and eyeliner she wore. Only her lips were bare of cosmetics, and they were thin and bloodless. Despite the fact that I knew her face was flesh and blood, there was still something about her that made me think she was wearing a mask.

I handed her the Old Deck and then allowed one of the Attendants to deliver me back to the airport.

From there, my life settled into a quiet monotony. I got older, I got richer. I got married, I got divorced. I committed crimes, I avoided jail. And today, I find myself in a summer home transformed into a hospice, talking to the most foolish of my nephews.

My sources tell me you’re a horrible gambler. How much of your wife’s money have you lost over the last two years? A little over a million? A little less? If you get on that plane to Columbia you’ll lose more. The greedy stooges behind your invitation are counting on it.

The sources that mentioned your vulnerability also informed me of the colossal statue of the Seventh Barishamada positioned at the heart of the casino amusement park you're set to visit. This statue is constructed from brass and stands at a height exceeding twenty feet. During the Festival's final night, a bonfire is kindled beneath it, enveloping the air in a symphony of screams and smoke.

that there's a statue of the Seventh Barishamada at the center of this casino slash amusement park you’ll be going to. It is over twenty feet tall and made of brass. They tell me that on the last night of the Festival, a bonfire is lit beneath it and the air fills with screams and smoke.

The same sources that revealed your vulnerability also provided me with details about this upcoming venture. They mentioned the colossal statue of the Seventh Barishamada positioned at the heart of the casino slash amusement park you're set to visit. This statue is constructed from brass and stands at a height exceeding twenty feet. I've been informed that during the Festival's final night, a bonfire is kindled beneath it, enveloping the air in a symphony of screams and smoke.

Hear me out. Don’t go. Your wife and children will burn and you will be reduced to a toothless, hairless ruin aged beyond their years.

Good. If you want to win something back, aim to reclaim your heart and soul. Be more than just a swindler and a gullible gambler.

Now, it's time for you to go. I've been told I don't have much time left, and I'd rather spend it in peace in my garden with my duck pond.

As for my Prize, I thought about other temptations like money, power, or second chances. But what I truly wanted is what I received my hands around Charles Poelzeg’s throat.

I (27F) live in a three person rental apartment. I've lived here for 1.5 years since moving out of my abusive dad's house. I am estranged from my family now and I have been a student all my life (I am a grad student now) and I really worked hard to save up on my tiny stipend and teaching to be able to move out. The place I now live is the first place I have ever felt to be home. I worked hard for it. It is a place I feel at peace. My sanctuary where I've done a lot of healing from trauma. A place where my neurodovergent brain felt like everything just clicked right and I could feel a sense of being settled and peace, which is rare for me to find. It was a place I felt safe up until recently.
Recently one of my flatmates moved out. I tried so hard to find a good flatmate fit for the house. Honestly I am out of the houseo most of the day due to having meetings and seminars in the afternoon and then straight to the gym and back home at 10pm to eat and sleep. But it really made the whole difference to my day to have a couple of quiet tranquil hours at home in the morning when I work and also decompress and feel at ease and unstressed. The new guy who I eventually picked is also a grad student (which in retrospect I shouldn't have taken a gamble on, but it meant lower tax and be seemed nice). I picked him because when we discussed day schedules he said he's up and getting ready for work between 8-9am and then heads to the lab (he works in bio science). Typically having these misaligned schedules works really well for the flat dynamic. It's a tiny flat and noise carries... one of the rooms in the house is tiny and no one takes it if they intend to be spending much time in the flat. Indeed all of the tenants who have ever lived there during my time have basically been out the whole day. I actually love the guy who has that room and love when he's around; he's a really chill and calm guy. It's generally worked well having misaligned schedules for the other two rooms. I am home in the morning and have a moment of peace then, and in the past the other tenant would be working out of home a 9-5 and has the whole flat to themselves for the evening. Everyone's appreciated that peace and freedom. 
Except what this guy said about his schedule is absolute bullshit. Since he's moved in a month ago, he generally wakes up 9-11am, is home until 12/1pm and is playing guitar, listening to music with his door half open, talking to himself when he is going in and out of the kitchen, doing laundry etc etc. He's just generally a chaotic presence and it sounds like he's always rushing and slamming doors. He's also home in the evenings from 6ish from the few times I've been sick and not gone to the gym. So he literally has the whole house to himself for several hours every evening when he can do all of these things as loud as he wants. But I am just so angry. The only tiny piece of day I had where I could chill in peace was a couple of hours in the morning which now feels super stressful. Even if he's being briefly quiet I'm anticipating that he's going to burst out of his room listening to some podcast at any moment. I feel tense and anxious all the time. I wake up feeling a deep sense of dread.

I don't really know what to do anymore. The reality of the situation is: I can't do anything about him being home except be angry. But if the only solution is I get myself out of the house, that means I literally have no time at all with a peaceful environment in which I can decompress. I have no time to even do laundry or meal prep. Logistically it's also a pain because I have food allergies and have to prep and carry my meals with me. I already prep and take a preworkout meal with me along with all of my gym stuff and office stuff when I leave for the day. If I leave for the office in the morning it means more lunch packing, preplanning, leaving my neurodovergent ADHD brain exhausted before I've even started doing any work.

I can't even sleep anymore because I dread waking up and feeling so much anxiety about this guy being chaotic. It literally feels like all the peace I had in this little place, that I worked so hard to cultivate, is gone. I feel I can't breathe, like I'm suffocating. A couple of days ago I had a panic attack and ended up missing meetings because I just needed to be home in some peace and quiet for a while and the guy finally left home, so I stayed. I needed it. But I don't know what to do anymore. It is incredibly difficult to leave the flat now, both because of what my work schedule is looking like over the coming months (teaching and travel for research abroad), and because the contract is flexible which is a rare find in this city; I need that flexibility because I don't know when my PhD will end. I have about 1 year but it could be anywhere 6-18momths depending on the duration of internship and extension I take. I also did all the hard work arguing against a rental increase with my landlord. And being honest I will not find a place that isn't a dump for the price I currently pay.

Sorry this is so long. I really don't see a solution anymore. It's been a hard month. My aunty passed away, i broke up with my boyfriend, this housing situation is a mess, I got really sick and stressed from this situation to the point i that I lost 7kg in two weeks from the stress of him being around. I am estranged from my family and have no support there. To add to it I spilt coffee on my laptop and it broke- extra financial burdens meaning I don't have the luxury of clinging money at the problem to find a different place. I feel like an insomniac zombie..I just want a crumb of peace. Just a tiny bit. And it hurts because I'm sure any other choice of the housemates who wanted the room would have been alright.

I'm a senior returning for my second SWE internship at a developer tooling corp, \~1k engineers. My review last year was quite good, with multiple levels of company hierarchy vouching to bring me back. This year, I'll likely end up on a different team. My goal is to get brought back here as a SWE 3. If not I'd take SWE 2 and still apply to other places. For context, this company has 4 levels of SWE before senior. I am not certain that someone has ever entered as SWE 3, though a recruiter mentioned it being possible.

Interns in the past have converted their second internships to full-time SWE 2, instead of typical new grad SWE 1. How do you do this in practice? Obviously do a good job, but there must be something more than just crushing technical expectations that goes into it. For instance, at work I usually stick to myself, I don't think I'm the type to schedule coffee chats with random people just for the sake of networking. Perhaps doing so and making my face more recognized throughout the company would help? Also, before the internship starts, I'll have a call with my team's manager to find out what project I'm working on.

1jlz54k,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jlz54k/why_are_light_roast_coffee_beans_for_pour_over/,Why are light roast coffee beans for pour over pricier than medium and dark roast?,"If you often buy different roast level beans for pourover, you might’ve noticed light roasts can cost 1.5x to 2x more than medium or dark roasts. After some digging, I’d like to break down why.

Light roasts demand higher-quality beans. They retain more origin flavors and acidity, requiring premium green beans (specialty-grade) to ensure complexity. While they highlight good notes—fruity, floral, bright acidity—they also reveal flaws. To minimize off-tastes, beans must be top-notch. Moreover, These good-quality beans grow slowly, yield less, and are hand-picked, driving up costs. For the dark roasts, mask defects with caramelized, charred flavors from longer roasting, so lower-grade beans work, keeping prices down. It’s like cooking: a premium steak needs just salt and a sear to shine; average meat might need heavy marinade and slow braising to taste good. Light roast is the “premium steak”; dark roast is more like “braised meat.”

Light roast baking demands precision, and precision brings higher cost. Roasting finishes promptly after the first crack at a range of 350°F-400°F. This serves to conserve bean characteristics. Conducting this process consistently demands skilled roasters, professional equipment, constant monitoring, and small-batch production, which increases labor and overhead expense. Dark roasting, with longer times and uniform flavors , allows larger batches and less oversight, improving efficiency and cutting expenses.

Market demand for light roasts is high, but supply is limited. The rise of global specialty coffee has boosted demand for light roasts, yet trees producing suitable beans require more land, restricting planting scale and overall supply compared to dark roasts. With scarce supply and strong demand, distributors often bid competitively for high-quality light roast beans, raising costs for consumers—somewhat akin to the wine market.

Packaging and shipping also raise costs for light roasts. Their optimal flavor peaks 2-10 days post-roast, requiring freshness-preserving sealed bags (often with one-way valves), which are pricier. Small-batch production further increases per-unit shipping expenses from origin to consumer. Dark roasts, less sensitive to freshness, can be transported in bulk more economically, lowering costs compared to light roasts.

Not all light roasts outprice dark roasts. Dark roasts using rare beans (like specially processed Bourbon varietals) or marketed as premium can exceed the cost of standard light roasts. However, dark roasts generally follow a more “budget-friendly” route in supermarkets or cafes.

So light-roast beans cost more because of top-notch beans, careful crafting,fast shipping and bold flavors. At the same time, Brewing’s tricky - pricey beans can flop if the grind’s off, timing’s bad, or method’s weak. You might end up with a weird-tasting mess. Every brew’s a bet - did I waste the expensive beans? When I did everything is right, the perfect cup’s totally worth it.",0,1743179415.0,pourover,4,0.21,False

I'm looking for a walkable neighborhood with good restaurants and coffee shops located nearby, and found Short North to be a good candidate. I heard Grandview Heights is great and safe but the rent prices are outside my budget ($1,800 - 1,900 for rent).

I've come down to the following 3 options but with some concerns for each of them:

* Foundry at Jeffrey Park
   * Electricity is sub-metered by NEP which I heard is crazy overcharged and is notorious for all sorts of reasons.
   * The windows are single-pane and not so great, so it will be very cold and will make utility bills cost a lot during winter times.
* Station 324
   * Electricity is sub-metered by Pioneer Energy Management, seems to be not as bad as NEP but still electricity bill will be expensive.
   * Charges for sewer for utilities
   * Heard there are hidden fees
* The Beeker
   * Not a huge difference but overall relatively less appealing than the other two options:
      * Quality-wise (Building & Unit & Amenities)
      * Saw reviews that the neighborhood around the apartment isn't very safe and is noisy.
   * Doesn't seem to have a fitness center nearby.

I'm used to living in apartments were utilities are all included in the rent fee, so I have no idea how much to expect for sewer/water/electricity, especially when they're sub-metered. I also heard some apartments charge common area electricity fees allocated among the residents and also have no idea how much to expect for those charges.

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated regarding the above apartments or any other suggestions; main concerns are noise (within unit & outside building), safety, utility charges.

After 50 years of service to the US Army Corps of Engineers, we’re saying good bye to our office building at 109 St. Joseph Street. We will provide an opportunity for alumni of Mobile District to stop by and enjoy one last walk thru the old building. Below are a couple of security and housekeeping tips:

* **Please utilize the main entrance only, for entry AND exit.** You will still need to present your CAC or Government Photo ID (alumni) to the FPS guards to gain entry.

* For alumni without a CAC, you will need to sign in on the roster provided.

* Fire/Emergency protocols: In the event of an evacuation, the elevators will be out of service. You will take the nearest stairwell, down to the main floor and exit the building. **The rally point will be at Bienville Square.**  We will have District employees posted on certain floors to assist with hard to evacuate personnel in the event of an evacuation, and will be identified by Red lanyards.

* **Please take all trash with you (i.e. if you bring a coffee cup, or a pastry, take the trash out with you).** This will ensure that our logistics team does not need to do another cleaning with GSA. They’ve worked exceptionally hard, please be mindful of their work.

* Please do not remove or alter the exterior window blinds.

* Restrooms will still be available to use.",15,1743178747.0,USACE,1,1.0,False
1jlyuqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1jlyuqh/riu_palace_aquarelle_jamaica_montego_bay_area/,Riu Palace Aquarelle (Jamaica - Montego Bay area) - Resort Review,"I've been back for a couple of weeks since a week long vacation with my daughter (early high school graduation present) to the Riu Palace Aquarelle in Jamaica.  This review won't focus on price or our package deal, flights, etc. but for a change everything went very smoothly booking and flying through Sunwing from Canada.  No issues with the included airport transfers and due as the resort wasn't that far from the airport paying extra for private transfers I didn't think necessary.  Flew through the airport and baggage areas both in Toronto and Montego Bay.

I knew going in that the resort was pretty new (about a year old now or so) and TA reviews were pretty positive so I would say expectations I had going in were pretty high and I have to say almost to a tee the resort met those expectations.  Was there over Canadian march break so was very busy but the resort could handle that no problem.  First half of the week seemed to also line up with some US spring break so it was a bit 'frat party' like for a bit.  But not overwhelming.  Someone said because resort isn't adults only and as a 'palace' the price probably keeps many spring breakers away.

The Highs:

\- Staff.  Every single staff person we met were super friendly, helpful, and seemed to be enjoying their jobs.

\- Service: It was always easy to get a drink at any bar (tip or no tip) and the bartenders were chatty, fun, told jokes, gave suggestions, etc.  No issues what so ever.  Service to the beach was also surprisingly good.  Came around often and pretty quick.  I don't normally do beach service very much as I find I'm up and about enough (plus need to use the facilities) that it is just as easy to grab something on way back to the seat.

\- Bars/Alcohol: See above re. great service and it was easy to ask for top shelf (Appleton, CC, Bombay Sapphire, Tanqueray, etc) alcohol.  Drinks were served quite strong mostly so no watering down.  Beer (Red Stripe) was good but you get sick of the same beer by the end of the week.  The sports bar also made the best coffee, including ice coffees.  Lots of places to get drinks (lobby bar, sports bar, two swim-ups, main beach bar and then in the evening the outdoor bar(s) open up near the shows too.  Not to mention Riu's drink station in your room.

\- Cleanliness: Everything was super clean.  The landscaping, decks, rooms, washrooms, hallways, lobby, etc.  All fixtures worked, lots of TP, no issues at all.

\- Hotel in General: This is only the 2nd 'hotel' style AI I've been to and loved the layout.  Super easy to find everything.  The 4 ala-carte restaurants all grouped together, the beach and pools were like 30 second walk apart.  Easy and fast to get back to your room if you forget something, etc.  The pools were great.  There is a deeper activity pool for aqua sports, pool volleyball (didn't use) but then two other big pools divided into sections.  Each pool had a swim up bar (which was adults only).  The one main pool was also adults only while the other was for families.  But the layout was great.  Also it was so EASY to get chairs on beach or pool.  Did NOT need to play the towel game.  I would usually head to the beach and grab two chairs and an umbrella (either grab it yourself or a staff will).  Because the beach and pool were so close together you don't have that issue of people reserving a place at both.  Tonnes of chairs available. 

\- Food: The buffet was very good.  Something for everyone, lots of choice and nice that it had both indoor AC seating or covered non-AC seating with ocean type views with lots of fans.  Service was fast and no issues with anything.  I also loved the sports bar for food.  Not a lot of choice (hot dogs, burgers, nachos, wings, or a salad) but the nachos, burgers and wings were great.  It was nice to take a break from the heat and eat a quick lunch there.  Finally, we loved the food near the beach for lunch (Pepe's or something like that).  Was fresh cooked jerk chicken but also had nacho bar, fries and other foods.  Super good and lots of seating near the bar overlooking the ocean.  Was outstanding.  We ate at each ala-carte.  Liked them all.  Reservations through the Riu app.  Took getting used to.  Have to sign in to the app with room info to make reservations.  The trick is at midnight the next batch open up.  You can book on the app for the same night and one night out.  I had no trouble getting reservations.  Food was great and service very fast (maybe almost too fast, ha ha).  Steak at the steak restaurant was amazing.  The Asian restaurant was tapas style.  Interesting and fun and wanted to go back.  Italian and 'gourmet' were the others.  Both also very good.  Didn't try the room service at all.

\- Animation Team/Shows: The team was fun, lots of activities, parties, games, sports, etc.  No issues and they weren't too pushy to force you to participate if you didn't want to.  We generally liked the evening main shows too.  Good quality overall.  The resort is smaller so the main shows are not quite say as 'big' as you would get at a mega-resort but the entertainment was still fun.  My daughter loved the 'beach bash' at the ocean bar area that had dancers or DJs.

\- The Room: We did not have a fancy room.  Partial ocean-view but on 2nd floor sort of with the roof of part of the hotel (the restaurant area) blocking the good view.  But we were never really in the room.  But it was very modern, clean, had a nice couch, TV worked great (didn't try to sign in to Netflix or anything).  You need to put your room key in the slot to turn on the power to the room so the hack is to just keep a library card or something in there when you go out so it isn't pitch black when you get back late (or say you want to charge your phone while out, without that the plugs don't work).  The king bed was very comfortable and not as hard as I remember Riu beds being in the past.

\- The Beach: Beautiful water, amazing sand, close to the pools, lots of chairs, close to pool bars, drink service also good, good beach volleyball, etc.  As others have noted there are rocks in the water.  But parts of water are pure sand.  So not the greatest in water for swimming and playing but more than fine for hanging out or cooling off in the shallow area.  No really seaweed on shore but some in the water.

\- The Waterpark: There is a small water park for very small kids that looked fun for them but didn't use it (no young kids with me) but the larger waterslide area was great.  Only 6 slides and all were fast and scary but comfortable (didn't hurt me going down).  It was a nice touch.  Only used it one day.

The Cons:

Very few cons.  I'd say the two biggest would really only be the rocks in the water and that the bouys delineating the swimming area keep you pretty close to shore.  So no 'deep water' swimming.  Again, was not a deal breaker.  I'd say the biggest con was just that the noise.  The music, activities, and animation options start hoping late morning / early afternoon and the speakers, mikes, etc. are pretty loud.  So once that stuff starts I'd say the pool area isn't super relaxing.  Didn't bother me as on the beach it wasn't as bad.  Also, at night the show and post-show DJ type stuff (whether at main stage or at beach stage) was quite loud and as everything is close to hotel you can hear it in the room.  Didn't bother me as closing the balcony door made it manageable but if you are a light sleeper might be an issue.

Overall: Loved it and would come back in a heartbeat.",4,1743178638.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,0.84,False
