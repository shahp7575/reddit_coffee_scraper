i thought blocking them would be the end of it. im so stupid.

maya showed up at my apartment yesterday morning. i have no idea how she got past the lobby but she was just there knocking. i was still in bed, didnt answer. she sat in the hallway for like 45 minutes leaving voice memos under my door.

i could hear her through the door saying how sorry she is and how ""we need to talk about this like adults"" and how she ""cant lose me over this."" my roommate came home and told her to leave or shed call the cops. maya started yelling that i was being dramatic and immature.

my roommate literally had to threaten to call building security before maya left.

then the texts started. not from maya or my ex because theyre blocked. from mutual friends. asking whats going on. saying maya is ""really upset"" and wants to explain. one of them said ""theres two sides to every story.""

i lost it. sent a group text with screenshots. not the explicit stuff just enough to prove it wasnt a misunderstanding. said if they want to stay friends with cheaters thats fine but dont contact me again.

some apologized. but two of them said i was being vindictive by sharing ""private messages"" and that i need to calm down. private messages? theyre about MY boyfriend fucking MY best friend.

my ex has been trying to reach me through everyone. his sister texted. his mom texted saying he ""made a mistake"" and im ""making this harder than it needs to be"" by not talking to him. i blocked his whole family.

but heres the part thats actually breaking me. last night my roommate told me she saw them together. maya and my ex. at the coffee shop near our apartment. yesterday afternoon. so like 6 hours after maya was crying outside my door about how sorry she is.

my roommate said they were sitting close, he had his arm around her. she took a photo to show me but i told her i dont want to see it.

so 3 days. it took 3 days for them to just be openly together after she was supposedly devastated about losing me.

i called out of work today because i cant stop crying. my boss was understanding but i lied and said it was a family emergency because i cant explain this.

i keep looking at my blocked messages. theres like 50 from maya on instagram. i cant see them but i can see the notification count going up. my ex has tried calling from different numbers. i just keep blocking them.

one of the mutual friends who defended them texted me this morning saying ""maya and \[ex\] are actually good together, maybe this happened for a reason."" i didnt even respond. just blocked her too.

im running out of people.",2,1763568952.0,TwoHotTakes,2,1.0,False

I’ve never had a decent medium or light roast out of it and my wife prefers dark, so I’d given up on those roast levels.

I recently got back into roasting, so I added a k6 to see if I could pull a nice light roast. Didn’t seem much better, so I tried a used vario with steel burrs.

I have been horribly humbled. I’m a terrible coffee roaster. I pulled a nice looking espresso and did an aeropress recipe, ground on the vario.

The clarity was undeniable and depressing. Notes of oxidation and battery acid on the espresso. The aeropress added a sharp detergent flavor.

This is with a Burundi Kiganda Murabi roasted to city+, 7:30 to fc, 10 total before drop, sealed for 3 weeks after resting for 24 hours with the lid loose.

I put the rocky up for sale and packed it in the closet, but this is feeling like a mistake.

I’ll buy a nice local light roast to try on it, but I’m at a bit of a loss. Maybe I need to clean the roaster better, try a different cooling method (leaf blower currently), or let the co2 out for longer before sealing.

Or maybe clarity isn’t for me. My wife’s dark roasts are also undrinkable in the vario, so I’m looking at hand grinding on the k6 for espresso, as I don’t have the counter space for the rocky.",1,1763568845.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My husband and I are part of a local org that has been working with a local good bank near us. So far the org has donated 700lbs this year. Our goal is to hit 1,000lbs by the end of December.  A lot of us have been coordinating sales and connections to get the most out of dollar. I do feel like we will be able to meet our goal. 

Personally, I have been in the situation when I was little that we didn't know where our next meal would come from. We did use food banks but that was like 15 years ago and I want to have suggestions that are current. Right now if I know my toddler will eat it, I know it's safe to donate.

My husband and I have decided to focus more on toddler and baby food because we feel that stuff is overlooked. 

Here is what we've been donating:
- Shelf stable milk
- Rice Rusks
- yogurt melts
- applesauce 
- beans 
- tuna
- canned veggies 
- canned fruit 
- baby puree
- baby wipes
- rice
- lentils
- oatmeal (variety packs) 
- cookie mixes
- Mac n cheese

- baby formula (the individual servings one)
- instant coffee (Everyone deserves a cup)
- powdered creamer

Main features: Create an account -> add friends -> create availability time slots to share with specific people, dictated by type of activity or vibe -> send requests to friends who share their availability to you and book time with them

Secondary features: create groups of friends, create a bookable link to send to a friend for a one-off purpose (i.e. catching up with an old coworker over coffee, they don't need to see all your avails and such), chat in the app to coordinate hangs.

I bought a new moccamaster during prime days this summer, I was excited to come back into the fold, I read the posts here, i bought a zero water water filter, I dialed in my grinder, and it took WEEKS to get an ok tasting cup. I must be sensitive to the taste of a new/cleaned/something brewer.

For context,I barely ​go out ​​ like twice a month max and even then, we’re all busy adults so our schedules only match at night. And we’re not doing anything wild. We literally just eat, get coffee, and catch up. My friends are responsible, successful people, and we don’t party or flirt or get wasted. It’s chill.

I was actually having a good time for once… until my dad messaged me asking what time I’d be home. I said maybe around 12AM. Suddenly he tells me NO, I have to be home before 10PM. And then he starts spam-texting.

Stuff like:  
“What’s wrong with you?”  
“Do you even think about us?”  
“You’re only good when you're with your friends.”  
“You don’t care about your family.”  
“We can’t sleep without you.”

Just straight-up guilt-tripping me while I’m literally just sitting in my friend’s car as a passenger. I wasn’t even planning anything crazy, ​just wanted ONE peaceful night out.

My mood immediately died. And it was embarrassing because I couldn't just suddenly ask my friend to drive me home early, th​ey’d have to cut the whole hangout short because of me.

So I snapped. I told my dad they're being too much, that I’m an adult and I know what’s right and wrong, that we’re always careful, and that nothing bad is happening. I didn’t yell, but I finally said what I’ve been holding in, t​hat I feel suffocated by how strict and dramatic they get whenever I’m not physically at home.

Now my parents are acting like I'm the​*​​* unreasonable one. They say I “talked back,” I “changed,” and I “value my friends more than my family.” But honestly? I’m exhausted. I go out twice a month.

Only FM and I were home often. When I stepped out of my room, I saw FM entertaining his staff in the living room. Someone I also knew. I ate, prepared to shower. Inside the bathroom, I felt a presence. (We have 2 CRs: one for toilet, one for bathing. The bathroom doors has open spaces top & bottom like a saloon-style door.) I saw FM’s staff pass by again and again. I didn’t think much of it until he disappeared. While I was rinsing off, I felt that heavy suffocating sense that something was off. When I looked at the bottom gap, I saw feet standing still. My heart stopped. I slowly looked up & saw a phone pointed directly at me. I screamed “*****! You’re recording me?! Wth is wrong with u?!” I rushed out shaking & half-dressed. Confronted him immediately, he denied everything, pretended I imagined it. Said he only went to pee. But I was done being gaslit. I demanded his phone. When I opened the gallery it shows ‘Recently Deleted’ folder. Proof that he just deleted something. I felt sick. Worst part? FM sided with him, said I was overreacting. I locked myself in my room, called my father. He rushed home from work with a police officer but the predator was already gone. We rushed to police station only to be told we must start at barangay. Next morning, we went to barangay hall. He was summoned.

1st H: He acted innocent, calm, composed. FM sat beside him, defending him. Saying I was inventing a story. I learned it takes 3 hearings (H) before officially elevated to police.

2nd H: He denied everything again but this time, he started apologizing. Denying AND apologizing. I wanted to stand up, scream & st*b him. 

Before 3rd H, things at home were falling apart. FM’s condition was worsening from stress. My father & FM fought constantly. I thought long & hard bout everything.

3rd H: This time, he broke. In front of everyone, he admitted EVERYTHING. Apologized, kneeled, cried uncontrollably. I stared straight at him & said, “Ur apology means nothing to me” & the only reason I wasn’t pushing the case was because it would tear my family apart & my parents felt sorry for FM whose health had declined from stress. A written agreement was made that if he ever approached me, entered our home, or repeated anything similar, I could immediately go to the police.

But trauma doesn’t end with a signature. Months passed, I couldn’t move on. Every night those memories kept replaying. Every shower reminded me of the fear. Every glance at the door made my chest tighten. Healing never came. Then one night in the silence of my room, I snapped. Gathered every p*ll I had, crushed ‘em, opened, mixed everything then poured it all into the kettle that FM always used in the morning to heat water & make coffee. (not sure if he used that) 

After months, I left that house
A year+ later, FM di*d
Maybe only from his illness
Maybe not
No one will ever know
Not happy
Just quiet inside.

Meriwether doesn't think it's sad she's only ever taken jobs that are excuses to isolate herself. She thinks it's rather useful. The [Central Park job](https://old.reddit.com/r/CampHalfBloodRP/comments/1mhwt6g/burying_job/) let her avoid her birthday (with limited success), and this one gives her a pretense to disappear into the forest. For someone who can't stand being seen in public, it's perfect.

It's been weeks since the spectacle that was Themis's war crime trial. Mer's still not recovered from the humiliation of it. Being out around people makes her feel watched, exposed; a conspicuous blemish everyone silently agrees to ignore out of pity or malice. Part of Mer knows they probably just don't notice her. It's hard to find comfort in that. She's in pain, and everyone around her is ignorant to it, and Meriwether would rather die than talk about her feelings out loud (let alone make anyone listen), so she must suffer alone. And the loneliness compounds the pain compounds the loneliness until she has to \[take refuge\] in the dark Hecate cabin once again, away from the scouring masses.

A job in the woods sounds like a nice reprieve.

The Karpos is delightfully unaware of whatever social ostracization Meriwether may be experiencing, self-imposed or otherwise. He introduces himself as Emmer. Emmer is about two feet tall, looks to be made of bundled stalks of grain all twisted together, and has a face something something. He speaks with an earnest, high-pitched little voice that makes Mer have to hold back a grin.

""Just a little hutch, you know? Nothing too fancy, you know, just somewhere cozy where me and my friends can relax without worrying about the birds swooping down on us. Happens a lot, you know. My friend Zea had her hair plucked by a nosediving pigeon just last week!""

""Is she okay?""

""Well, she lost her tassels, which is a shame--she'd been growing those out for months. But she wasn't harmed, if that's what you mean.""

Meriwether figures 'tassels' must be the feathery fronds of grain sprouting out of Emmer' head. She's mesmerized by the merry way they bounce and sway when he moves.

""Do you know where you want your house to be? Maybe somewhere the birds won't see it.""

""Aha! Why, yes! I'll show you. Right this way!""

The little grain spirit leads her through the woods. She watches her strange new friend's hoppity-hopping gait with undiminished pleasure. They walk for over an hour, past familiar paths and into a glade Mer's never seen before. Five years wandering this place, and she still hasn't explored the full breadth of it. There's a spark of excitement in that, of hope and wonder and bright curiosity at whatever lovely things might remain yet undiscovered in these woods and beyond. She used to feel all this bright time. What if she can again?

""It happened while all those storms were storming, you know,"" Emmer explains as he darts over to a large fallen tree. ""Back when the Lord of Thunder was so angry. We were glad when that died down. We much prefer your namesake, merry weather. But the storms did knock down this fine tree! We've been hollowing it out ever since.""

Indeed, the enormous trunk--oak, it looks like--is an empty shell. Mer peers through holes the karpoi ostensibly left for exit and entry. It smells sweet and warm and dry inside. The walls are thick; the inner wood appears to have been carved away with tiny, careful blades. A glance at Emmer's sharp fingernails tells her the karpoi did this literally by hand. Mer is glad they prefer to use those claws for subtractive construction techniques.

""It's incredible,"" she says.

""Thank you! Not much of a home, though. We're good with the wood parts, you know, us being nature spirits and all, but none of us know how to make the soft parts. Stuff like couches.""

""That's where I come in.""

""That's where you come in! Can you do couches?""

""I think I can figure it out. What's everyone's favorite color?""

---

The Arts & Crafts cabin is a wonderful hideout after dark, Mer's found. Nobody's scheduling any activities in the wee hours, meaning she gets to hermit away in there all night. Does she miss sleeping in her own cabin? Only if she thinks about it, so she doesn't.

Mer's not the only one haunting this workspace by night. It was actually Kit's haunt first, but he was gracious enough to let his little sister trespass on his nocturnal territory.

It started as her watching him sew. Kit sews with the sort of mesmerizing grace Meriwether could watch for hours. But her own hands twitched and itched to imitate her brother's gloved dance of needle and thread, and soon enough, she was asking him to teach her.

It's not so graceful when Mer does it. She thinks she's actually worse than when she started. Hours upon silent hours have passed between the siblings, Kit working his way through adjustments to a pile of coats and long pants (ooc details if you need more: let's say mending and refreshing clothes so that campers have something to wear when the weather gets colder) and Meriwether fumbling the wretched needle through her colorful choice of fabric, and *still* the ""tote bag"" she's allegedly ""making"" looks like a mess of scraps and fraying edges. But something makes Mer keep at it. Perhaps it's her stubborn refusal to accept that her right arm really is so functionally impaired that she can't sew a damn bag if she wants to. Perhaps she just likes having something in common with Kit. Perhaps the pretty fabrics are enough to beguile her into enduring another night of defective motor skills and pricked fingers.

The guts of the tote bag-to-be are pushed aside on this night. In their place, Meriwether lays a rainbow of fabrics rummaged from drawers of remnants left by campers past. (She recognized an offcut from one of Hugo's old projects in there. That drawer was slammed shut.)

The geometry of a couch was so self-evident until the moment she tries to figure it put on paper. Minutes pass. Several sketches are crumpled and tossed aside.

""Hey Kit? Do you know how to do couches?""

He pauses, bemused, but with a small smile. Mer sometimes forgets even Kit can be caught off guard.

""...I think that I lack the necessary woodworking skills, for one,"" he says.

""What about just the pillows?""

""We can definitely do pillows.""

---

Someone is scraping chairs across the floor. Meriwether groans awake.

She'd stayed up sewing the pillows until the sky was lightening with the first hints of dawn, then apparently fell asleep over the table. Now it's mid-morning and somebody is rearranging the chairs for a lesson.

Mer barely glances at who it is as she gathers up the cushions into her arms. It sure would be nice if she had a tote bag to carry these! Luckily there aren't too many to hold; she wasted so much time failing to figure out couches that there was only time to make five pillows. They all survive her dead sprint from the Arts & Crafts cabin to Cabin 11, where they are dumped on her neglected bed while she picks through her rock collection.

A perk of living in the jack-of-all-trades cabin is that you can find junk of all trades lying around. Mer finds an empty shopping bag to bring the accumulated treasures to her next stop: the Hecate cabin.

""I made sure to only pick the shiny ones,"" she explains to Jacob. ""Can you make it so they turn on and off?""

""Not really. They're rocks. They don't have light switches.""

""What if I draw light switches with marker?""

""…Depends on the type of marker.""

""The ones you gave me for— the ones you gave me."" They were a gift on the day Mer's adoption was officialized.

""Those'll work.""

""Can you make them shine different colors?""

""Sure, but that might make it hard to see.""

""Oh, yeah. Okay, just regular lights then?""

""What's this even for?""

""The Karpoi!""

A little while later, Mer thanks her brother and heads off.

The walk back to Emmer's glade feels different this time. She doesn't lose her way—she never does—but traveling alone begets a certain internal quietude that Meriwether isn't altogether comfortable with. She's forced to realize she feels safe here among the rustling green. The silence with Camp out of earshot, the secret beauty of a wild place so remote, the invisibility she can bring upon herself to truly fade into the scene, it all makes Mer feel so good. At peace. *Happy.*

Her stomach turns. She runs the rest of the way to the hollowed-out tree.

Nobody's home when she gets there. Mer takes care to arrange the furniture as neatly as she can manage, relying mostly on her uninjured left hand.

When i try to stop I get very irritable, emotional, angry, sad, anxious, crying, and sometimes i have SI. Im acting off socially too. im also bipolar, and can have mixed episodes, which can be triggered by substances. im on adderall too. but ive had bipolar episodes before and ive never had auditory hallucinations, just saw visual hallucinations once on a medication. I am two days sober. I woke up feeling okay this morning, but after some time i started getting very agitated by the thought of not being able to drink and not wanting to stop but having to, unusually angry and couldn't calm down. i had taken an adderall at 7, a gummy at 9, and kava at 10am. I had lots of coffee and cigs too.

I was in my basement, and i was about to walk up the stairs.

I'm a freelance translator, mostly Spanish to English for various companies. Last week I had two projects from pharmaceutical companies, both translating clinical trial documents. Company A is a big name, Company B is smaller.

I'm working on both, keeping them in separate folders. Very organized. Company A's file labeled CompanyA\_Clinical\_Nov.docx and Company B's is CompanyB\_Clinical\_Nov.docx.

Finished Company A's translation Tuesday morning. Had my coffee, did a final proofread, went to email it. Attached the document, wrote a professional email, hit send.

Except I attached Company B's file. To Company A. A document with confidential information about Company B's drug trials that Company A definitely shouldn't have.

Didn't realize until Wednesday when Company B asked for their translation. I went to send it and the file was still in the folder. That's when it hit me - if Company B's file is here, what did I send to Company A?

Checked my sent folder and felt my soul leave my body.

I immediately emailed Company A asking them to delete it without reading, that I sent the wrong file. Got an out-of-office reply. The manager's on holiday until next week.

So now somewhere in Company A's inbox is Company B's confidential document that I translated and sent them. Can't recall it. Can't confirm if anyone read it.

Company B doesn't know. Company A doesn't know I know. I'm just waiting for the shitstorm.

I've probably violated like fifteen NDAs and might've given Company A competitive intelligence worth millions. My career might be over. Can't sleep.

TL;DR: Mixed up files and sent Company A their competitor's confidential drug trial translation, potentially violating NDAs and creating a legal nightmare that I can't fix until someone gets back from holiday.",1,1763568224.0,tifu,1,0.67,False

1p1bka1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PeoriaIL/comments/1p1bka1/startup_is_live_looking_for_local_coding_help/,"Startup is Live, Looking for Local Coding Help!","Hey Peoria,

I wanted to share something big happening locally and put out a call for anyone in the area who’s into software, startups, or just wants to build something that actually matters.

I’m one of the founders of enterN, a hiring platform we’ve been working on quietly out of Distillery Labs (and with team members in Austin). We launched our MVP in a closed beta last week, and we already have 200+ signups without any paid advertising.

What we’re building:
enterN is a resume-free, bias-resistant hiring platform for students and early-career jobseekers. Instead of résumés, candidates build a 45-dimension “Professional DNA” profile that focuses on values, work styles, and culture fit. Employers swipe on candidates, candidates swipe on employers, and only mutual matches open up contact info.

Think “Hinge meets hiring,” built by people who’ve seen what’s broken in the system and want to fix it.

Why it matters:
Hiring is a mess—people get ghosted, overlooked, and filtered out by automated systems that don’t actually evaluate potential. We’re building something that’s fair, human, transparent, and makes hiring actually suck less.

The Team:
We’re small but extremely experienced:
	•	Jeffrey (me) – CEO, based in Peoria, former Indeed.com + community/workforce background
	•	Alyssa – CTO, Austin, 25-year engineer, former Indeed.com
	•	Amanda – Chief Product Officer, Austin, former Indeed.com
	•	Charlie – Platform Architect/DB, former Google (18+ years)

We have the product vision, design system, tech stack, and roadmap dialed. What we need now is more hands to help build.

Where We’re At:
	•	Closed beta live now
	•	200+ early jobseekers already onboarded
	•	Employers waiting in the wings
	•	Strong traction data from pilot programs earlier this year
	•	Pre-Seed raise underway but early-stage investors want to see continued product velocity + user growth
	•	We need 1–2 more developers to accelerate feature development and ship faster

What We’re Looking For:
Developers (any of the following):
	•	React / Typescript
	•	Node / Express
	•	PostgreSQL / Drizzle
	•	AWS / SST
	•	General Full-Stack
	•	Or even juniors who want to learn but can contribute consistently

What We can offer:
We’re pre-revenue right now, so this would be equity-forward, with a very generous structure for early builders. Our goal is to bring 1–2 committed devs into the team who want to help shape the future of the product.

If you’re interested in startup work, want to build something meaningful for Peoria and beyond, or just want to chat about what we’re doing, shoot me a message. Happy to grab coffee at Distillery Labs or hop on a call.

Peoria has real talent. I’d love to build this next phase with people who care about the region and want to be part of a high-growth startup from the ground floor.

1p1bilf,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1p1bilf/constantly_high_adrenaline/,Constantly high adrenaline,"Hey peaters, my wife and I are having the same issues for less than a year, we went through many stressful events and it had a big impact on our physical and mental health, our body can't destress no matter what (including meditation, yoga, breathwork etc...) and it's not tolerating most of the supplements anymore, we either get no effect or a lot of side effects from supplements that used to work pretty well.

No effects anymore from : Magnesium, Potassium, Salt, Selenium, Molybdenum, Zinc, L-Theanine, Taurine, Glycine, Gabaergic herbs like Passionflower, Valerian root, Lemon Balm, Chamomile.

Side effects from : B1, B2 (helps the digestion but exacerbate the high adrenaline state), B5, B6, B9 and B12, certains adaptogens like Schisandra, Jiaogulan, we noticed that we are very sensitive to serotonin variations and anything that can raises Serotonin even at very low dose like Methionine, Tryptophan or Omega 3 found in food make us worse, but at the same time, things that reduce Serotonin are of no effect.

We also noticed that our digestion is very very slow, in fact it feels like food is stuck, and we literally have to take coffee and nicotine gum after each meal to ease the stuck sensation, we also noticed that our body have a lot of difficulty to regulate the mood.

We've both done lab tests and have high cortisol but with high transcortin, TSH at around 1 (I think it's suppressed because of the high cortisol), mid range fT4 and fT3 (fT3 not in the optimal range), low TPO Antibodies, the fT3 rT3 ratio is also not that good.

We had great success during the summer with bovine thyroid but we felt very fatigued after 3-4 weeks, I suspect the high T4 to T3 ratio in bovine thyroid to be the issue. We've been recently able to order T4 (50mcg per tablet) and T3 (25mcg per tablet) and are wondering what are the best ratios and dosage. Our goal is to fix the constantly high adrenaline/high serotonin/low gaba/low dopamine state to be able to tolerate vitamin B2 which help activate B6 and tolerate all the others B Vitamins especially B1 that we are very deficient at, it also restore MAO and COMT activity to reduces excess serotonin, adrenaline and estrogen. (which my wife suffers from as well as copper toxicity from a copper IUD that makes it worse, and of course she removed it a few months ago)

Any ideas to help are welcome, we've tried Aspirin, Pregnenolone, Progesterone, DHEA without success. We however had great success with two Chinese herbs that mimics thyroid effect : Prepared aconite (Zhi Fu Zi) and Deer Antler Glue but it's way harder and more expensive to get in Europe than T3 lol.

This is really just another friend-searching post. Sports leagues are great for many, but not for everyone. I have tried it for a year or two. Being an introvert, waiting on the side of the court inbetween games stressed the fuck out of me. People just talked to people they already knew. I prefer smaller groups. I'm great at one on one, comfortable at 4, and 6 is a stretch. In any group above 6 people, my brain starts to freeze. I know it's a ""me"" problem and I've tried therapies but nothing works. So, I thought there's gotta be people like me eh?

I want to see if people can bond over some ""niche"" hobbies, and realize maybe they are not so niche after all. And I'd also like to be inspired to take up some hobbies to kill time during the winter. So, here are mine:

* I was very into fountain pens and inks for a while and have a moderate collection (30+ pens and 80+ inks). That extended to stationery in general. If you know what Tomoe River, Midori, Traveler's Notebook is, we have a lot to geek out on. Maybe we can go to Scriptus next year.
* To use up my inks faster, I started taking calligraphy classes a few years back. I don't practise nearly enough, but to untrained eyes they look great. If you're also an artsy or crafty person, I'd like to see what you make and maybe we can exchange some small gifts from time to time.
* I also like to take some random crafting workshops. I took a wax seal workshop lately and it was a lot of fun. If you have some good suggestions, send it my way :)
* Dancing - not electro/rave, not dancehall or latin. I learned Irish step dance for a few years, and also took some random classes in tap dance, Lindy Hop/swing, rockabilly jive. For the next one, I'm interested in solo jazz and maybe beginner kpop.
* I like jazz a lot. When I travel to other cities, I always try to check out their local jazz bar. If you're interested in hanging out at DROM Taberna or Grossman's Tavern and the likes, hit me up.
* I like listening to podcasts. It's probably not that niche of a hobby nowadays, but I'd like to meet people who listen to any of these - ""99% Invisible"", ""Your Undivided Attention"", ""What Now? with Trevor Noah"". Maybe a podcast club (like a book club) to discuss some episode(s) over coffee/tea.
* Last one, movies. I know it's not niche by itself, but there are definitely fewer people going to the theatres. I don't like superhero movies. I prefer A24 over Marvel/DC. I'm not a movie buff and I don't know any director's name. I just like to sneak in some snacks and sometimes spend the whole afternoon at the cinema.

Phew, I think I have some more but this is a good (and long) start. I've spent quite some time on this, and if you've read it through, hopefully you can leave some quality responses with your hobbies :) (don't just leave a ""looking for same"" or ""DM me"").

Starts in Nazaré (yeah, the big wave spot), punches inland through the Serra de Aire mountains, then back along the coast.

**Stats that hurt:**

* 130km / 2200m elevation
* Multiple 12-13% grade climbs
* Mix of forest gravel, mountain ridges, coastal paths

Made a quick video of some sections: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TZlavw\_0clI](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TZlavw_0clI)

The climb at km 45 is absolutely brutal but the views from the ridge are unreal. You can see the Atlantic on one side and mountains on the other.

**Question for experienced gravel riders:** What would you pack for something like this? I'm thinking it's a solid 7-8 hour day for most riders. Too much? Not enough suffering?

Context: I’m a home body, so I’m in my room a lot. Of course, I get out of the apartment when I can for work, errands, to see family, or to do smth fun. But I am in my room a lot of the time. She’s asked about my hobbies and what I do in my free time in the past, kind of out of concern not curiosity. She’s an active person so I get it.

We used to smoke weed together but she stopped because it was making her manic and she’s going into the military next year. I still smoke though out on our balcony. She hasn’t mentioned it bothering her since quitting.

She told me 3 weeks ago she’s moving out because the trains near us are too loud. We really haven’t had a real convo or hung out since she told me. Been feeling like she has an issue with me but I don’t press it bc she’s preached many times in the past about open communication and speaking up about problems. I figure if she hasn’t brought it to me it’s not a big deal.

Issue: Last night, I’m in the kitchen starting to make dinner around 7pm. She’s about to leave but stops to say, “It’s not really my business. But what do you do in your free time? All you do is cook and eat. It makes me sad that you’re not taking care of yourself. Do you not worry about yourself?” I feel really weird about this. I thank her for the concern but affirm that it really is not her business because it isn’t! She has no idea what I do in my free time aside from at our apartment. She leaves and I go about my night.

Our apartment is small, so my room, her room, and the bathroom are all sharing a corner. I wake up around 3am to use the toilet, I’m in there for a bit. I hear my roommates door open then close presumably bc she also needed the toilet, and I hear her unprompted and LOUDLY go “God she’s fucking useless. All she does is eat and get high.” I’m washing my hands at this point and go to open the door for a sec before almost slamming it to let her know I heard her. When I leave the bathroom I can tell her room is dark but the door is open and she’s standing there. For a second I thought about confronting her, but it was 3am so I just went to my room without a word.

It had me fuming. What was the reason? I have a past of depression and isolation, so I get being concerned for someone’s mental and physical health. It was just such a rude and degrading comment that could have been left unsaid. Write it in a journal or something. What I do with my free time should not affect you to the point of frustration, especially if I’m not doing anything wrong! Yesterday, I was out all day literally from 8-5. Drove two towns over to Xmas shop and get coffee with my mom! I may be a homebody and love food, what the fuck is so wrong with that.

People just talked to people they already knew. I prefer smaller groups. I'm great at one on one, comfortable at 4, and 6 is a stretch. In any group above 6 people, my brain starts to freeze. I know it's a ""me"" problem and I've tried therapies but nothing works. So, I thought there's gotta be people like me eh?

I want to see if people can bond over some ""niche"" hobbies, and realize maybe they are not so niche after all. And I'd also like to be inspired to take up some hobbies to kill time during the winter. So, here are mine:

* I was very into fountain pens and inks for a while and have a moderate collection (30+ pens and 80+ inks). That extended to stationery in general. If you know what Tomoe River, Midori, Traveler's Notebook is, we have a lot to geek out on. Maybe we can go to Scriptus next year.
* To use up my inks faster, I started taking calligraphy classes a few years back. I don't practise nearly enough, but to untrained eyes they look great. If you're also an artsy or crafty person, I'd like to see what you make and maybe we can exchange some small gifts from time to time.
* I also like to take some random crafting workshops. I took a wax seal workshop lately and it was a lot of fun. If you have some good suggestions, send it my way :)
* Dancing - not electro/rave, not dancehall or latin. I learned Irish step dance for a few years, and also took some random classes in tap dance, Lindy Hop/swing, rockabilly jive. For the next one, I'm interested in solo jazz and maybe beginner kpop.
* I like jazz a lot. When I travel to other cities, I always try to check out their local jazz bar. If you're interested in hanging out at DROM Taberna or Grossman's Tavern and the likes, hit me up.
* I like listening to podcasts. It's probably not that niche of a hobby nowadays, but I'd like to meet people who listen to any of these - ""99% Invisible"", ""Your Undivided Attention"", ""What Now? with Trevor Noah"". Maybe a podcast club (like a book club) to discuss some episode(s) over coffee/tea.
* Last one, movies. I know it's not niche by itself, but there are definitely fewer people going to the theatres. I don't like superhero movies. I prefer A24 over Marvel/DC. I'm not a movie buff and I don't know any director's name. I just like to sneak in some snacks and sometimes spend the whole afternoon at the cinema.

Phew, I think I have some more but this is a good (and long) start. I've spent quite some time on this, and if you've read it through, hopefully you can leave some quality responses with your hobbies :) (don't just leave a ""looking for same"" or ""DM me"").

I have a pituitary adenoma producing high ACTH as it is. High cortisol, high prolactin.

I've heard the caffeine consumption of like 1 cup a day won't really further affect of cortisol my body is already over producing on its own. But just people's personal anecdotals.

I've been so ridiculously tired and fatigued off it (more than the usual) that I've been sleeping early around 8pm and up around 7am.

I also miss the ritual of just driving out in this winter and getting a coffee or warm beverage. Gave me a reason to go out and do something while im having a hard time doing anything as it is.

Quit THC as well same time, though I found it helped me cope and be happier. Not sure about THC cortisol anecdotals either.

curious to hear your thoughts. thanks.

TLDR - if already over producing ACTH/Cortisol, would caffeine (and/or thc) cause much further effect than what is already being unnaturally produced?

Edit: Forgot to add that my night sweats and jitters might seem to be less so far but too early to say

Hi there! I’m currently looking for a long-term, modern slice-of-life roleplay with plenty of depth, emotion, and those small everyday moments that mean everything. Think slow burns, shared apartments, post-college chaos, secret soft spots, rainy day coffee runs, I'm open to all the vibes.

I have some basic role/prompt ideas ready to go (roommates, childhood friends reunited, etc.), but I’m also super open to your ideas! Collaboration is half the fun, so don’t hesitate to bring your creativity.

I’m not super picky on length, I’m usually good at matching my partner’s style. Just hoping for a little more than one-liners so we can really dive into the story and characters.

If this sounds like your kind of RP, feel free to shoot me a DM! I’ll happily send you my ideas, and I’d love to hear yours too.

Disclaimer: If you don’t believe in love work or don’t have advice related to what I’m specifically asking, please just keep scrolling. Every witch has their own beliefs and boundaries, and I’m comfortable with the work I’m doing. I’m only looking for guidance from people who understand or practice similar work.

-I’ve been practicing for about four years
-I do divination but its unclear to me
- I’m currently working on reconciling with a past partner. Our ending was very abrupt and unwanted
-We’ve been in off and on communication for the past four months and had our most recent conversation last night.

For our connection, I made a sweetener jar
(includes honey, coffee grounds, sugar, lavender, his necklace initial, a written petition and sigil, bay leaf ash with a petition written on it, moon water, cinnamon, ginger, rose, jasmine, rose oil, cinnamon oil, chamomile oil, and dill. I sealed it with red wax and burned a red candle over it.

I’m not sure if any sweetening has happened yet, and I’m trying to understand where my block might be coming from. I did a block buster and a communication spell simultaneously recently. I did receive communication afterward, so something definitely moved, but I still feel like something is resisting.

This person is avoidant and has told me they’ve thought about coming back many times. They’ve said they’re in a very bad place without me, but that our past petty arguments make them feel like I would never forgive them or feel comfortable with them again, which is not true at all.

I’ve done reconciliation work before making the jar, but I think I need some insight or outside help. If anyone can see what I might be missing, or if you know any trustworthy witches or Etsy practitioners who take spellwork seriously and are easy to hire, I’d really appreciate recommendations.

Thank you so much.

After the riots in Ridge City, the world learned there truly was a guild of villains that ruled the underworld, but also believed they were defeated at the hands of the Association of Heroic Champions. 



But when the aliens known as the Wrexwren invaded in their attempt to take the world by force, the villains emerged from hiding to help the heroes fight the invaders. However, this revelation was overshadowed by a grim scene broadcast worldwide. The villain Fornax fought and then slaughtered the leader of the invasion while Lodestar saved the sun from a star-devouring monster. Now the world knows without a doubt that a guild of villains exist and many villains thought long dead are at the helm. The world is no longer a peaceful place, but people:  heroes, villains, and civilians alike still have to survive in it.



For those unfamiliar with the universe, consider it a ‘kitchen sink’ supers setting like Marvel or DC except with two primary factions: the Alliance of Heroic Champions serve a similar role to the Avengers or Justice League, but members run the gamut in power level from people dealing with street-level crime to people who save the world before their first cup of coffee. Their counterpart, the Guild of Villainous Reformation, is an association of active and retired supervillains who may or may not still commit crimes, but exists primarily to protect its members and the people they care about by limiting crime. Members of the Guild do not attack each other's family or holdings directly, just as they try to avoid doing the same with heroes as open war benefits no one.

My husband (46 M) and I(44 F) have been together for about 10 years and married for 8.
There is a lot of context so I apologize for the long post. 

About 3 years ago, he was diagnosed with MS after a few years of me noticing changes in his demeanor and his balance.  He really didn’t want to go to a Dr., but I nagged him to high hell about it.  

He was put on some medication, and it didn’t seem to work great.  I still saw his symptoms progress, and he didn’t really want to deal with it. 
I had always suspected he had ADHD because he had trouble remembering things and often couldn’t finish a task but I think maybe now he was just experiencing effects of undiagnosed MS.  

During this time, I really stepped up and became the organizer of his life because I am very detail oriented and efficient.  I made his drs appointments, I went to them whenever possible to actually tell the drs what I saw because he would downplay it.  But I couldn’t force him to take action on anything regarding his health and I started to become very frustrated with all the parenting and unbalanced division of labor in our marriage.  

We went to therapy for a few months and he never really talked about anything and tbh I didn’t think the therapist was great.  Over time, I just accepted this was my life with his diagnosis and I took vows and loved him so I lived with it.  We fought but overall I thought we were happy.

During this time, we rented a house because we couldn’t afford to buy.  We lived there for several years and I loved it.  One day the property manager texted us to tell us that the owner was selling and they would sell to us for waaaayyy too much.  I was devastated.  

For some extra context, I had an extremely traumatic childhood where my childhood home was foreclosed on and we were kicked out, we were evicted from two apartments, I lived in hotels, in my moms car and had to share a tiny bedroom and sleep in the same bed as her with multiple other strangers in a house, and finally was homeless for a time. I suffered emotional and sexual abuse during this time.  It took me a lot of therapy and distance from my parents to heal from this, but never feeling like I had a permanent home was always a fear of mine.
So this news wrecked me.  We immediately started looking for a new rental, and my in laws suggested we look at some new builds by them that we may have been able to buy. 

We found a rental that I loved and we were approved for, while simultaneously we found out we were pre approved for a loan to buy.  He and I had a long discussion about how if we bought this house it would be our forever home because I could not lose another house. We bought the house.  This was in Jan 2025.  

Our marriage was not perfect.  During this time I started to have some really strange physical symptoms and was going to the dr a bunch.  They thought maybe I had an autoimmune disease but none was found.  I was ultimately diagnosed with fibromyalgia for unexplained pain and severe fatigue.  I felt helpless.  I could barely make it through a day at work, I was too exhausted to do chores.  I gained 50 pounds because I literally got sweaty and couldn’t breathe just walking from the mailbox to the house.  I really started to feel angry about being his mom and him not sharing the household load.  I stepped away from managing his life to go into survival mode for me.  But during this time I still thought we were generally happy, but just going through it. 

In April of 2025 I got the worst period of my life.  And it never stopped. I spent months trying to get an OB appointment. Finally I was diagnosed with fibroids and severe anemia at the very end of June.
The first week of July we decided to get new phones. When we were transferring our data he suddenly couldn’t remember his phone code, which he blamed on his MS so he has me do mine first.  While the woman was in my phone doing her thing I look over and see him trying to delete text messages.  I didn’t say anything.  I thought I was being crazy. 

I wake up insanely early.  Always have.  I usually use this time to get things done because in the morning I have a tiny bit of energy. He had left his phone on the coffee table and at 5:45 AM he started getting texts from a female friend.  I still felt crazy but said screw it because my gut said so.  He had “miraculously” remembered his code and the cell phone store lady had written it on a post of with some other instructions for us to get a rebate.  I found that post it and I read his texts.

For 2 years he has been having an emotional affair with his coworker.  Maybe longer.  I have never liked her, I always felt like she had a crush on him.  While we were buying this house, he was sexting her.  While I was bleeding so much over the last 2 months my ferritin was 7, they were watching porn together.  He was telling her how sexy she was while I was losing my self confidence because despite only eating sub 1800 calories a day, I was gaining weight.
I died inside.  I confronted him.  He denied it.  I showed him that I had his phone and he finally admitted it. 

I kicked him out and made him stay at his parents.  While he was gone he texted me and begged me to forgive him.  He said he didn’t think what he was doing was wrong because it wasn’t sex. 
I said I wouldn’t forgive him but that he could come back if he slept in the guest room and we went to couples therapy again. 

I found a therapist who specializes in infidelity.  We’ve been in therapy every week since July.  He gets defensive, only really gives surface level answers when the therapist asks him hard questions and if he does finally admit fault he tries to then backtrack to explain why it really isn’t his fault. 
He doesn’t remember things I tell him, doesn’t keep track of appointments, and doesn’t do any of the homework the therapist gives him.  He then says it’s the MS.  I posted my situation in the MS subreddit and other people who have MS have said the forgetting and confusion is definitely MS but there are definitely ways to deal with them, none of which he is doing.  However, the insistence that he didn’t know what he was doing was wrong is not MS.  TBH, I already knew that but I wanted to be validated.  
Anyway, at this point I have given him a 6 month ultimatum.  I don’t really have any hope he’ll change so I’m bracing for divorce.

But we have no savings, since buying the house cleaned us out.  We are both currently on disability(another long story) so I can’t afford a lawyer. 

I don’t want to lose this house, I think it will break me.  And since we’ve only been here 9 months we have little equity.  I think we will lose money if we sell, and I’m terrified to go into a new life with a ton of debt. 

I can’t afford the mortgage myself, I could get a roommate but I’m worried that with my past trauma it will just make me feel uneasy all the time. We could refinance, but again being on disability I don’t think we can at the moment.

I have thought about renting a small house again and I think I could do that, but then I spiral about selling the house. And then there’s moving and deposits which again I can’t afford.  I have no family to borrow money from.  I have a few close friends but they are also aren’t in a position to lend me money. I would have to pay for movers because again no family or friends to help and I can’t life heavy stuff nor do I have the energy to do a move alone, as I’m still currently severely anemic since I’ve literally been bleeding since April. 

I cry everyday. I am so depressed. I feel like a shell of my former self.  I have no hope, no light at the end of my tunnel.

I guess in the end I am just asking for advice.  I know I need to leave but I don’t know how, what resources are available to me. I live in California so it’s a no fault state.

1. Doing a part two as people seem to enjoy part one of (although I could not get it as concise)
2. LMK if have suggestions or feedback (mentioned was nausea versus hunger, audio version.)
3. Mods let me know if it’s not OK to post.
4. Feel free to comments hacks or brands you’ve done/seen

*Part 1 explained why early pregnancy fatigue feels so different — the neuroactive progesterone acting on your brain, the blood volume changes, the placental energy drain. This is Part 2: given all that, what actually helps, in a way that makes sense biologically?*

⸻
**1. Rule out the fixable stuff (iron, thyroid, B12, vitamin D)**

Some of the exhaustion is non-negotiable: your brain chemistry and circulation are being rewritten. But pregnancy can also unmask problems that are fixable, like low iron, thyroid dysfunction, or B12/vitamin D deficiency.

Plasma volume ultimately expands by about 50% over pregnancy, but red blood cell production lags behind. This creates hemodilution: your blood is literally more diluted. If your iron stores were already marginal, you can tip into frank anemia quickly.

A simple but high-yield step is asking for a CBC (some automatically do on first visit), specifically asking for Ferritin (iron stores), TSH, and sometimes B12/vitamin D. Ferritin is often skipped in standard panels, but it drops before you become anemic. The expected “remodel” is one thing; discovering a failing circuit (anemia or thyroid issues) is treatable. Correcting those things doesn’t just “boost energy” — it directly improves oxygen delivery and metabolic balance.

⸻

**2. Hydration + light electrolytes, especially with nausea**

Early blood volume expansion plus vasodilation means you feel even mild dehydration more intensely: dizziness, headaches, weakness.

Steady fluid intake throughout the day matters more than random chugging. Also, if you’re chugging plain water without much salt or food, you can dilute your existing electrolytes, which may actually **worsen lightheadedness and nausea**. Sodium and potassium help maintain the right osmotic balance to keep fluid circulating in your bloodstream (rather than shifting into tissues). This translates to fewer “stand up and see stars” moments and more stable energy. 

⸻

**3. Short, deliberate rest instead of 3-hour daytime comas**

Progesterone acting on GABA receptors is already nudging your brain toward sedation. If you add multi-hour daytime naps, you start fragmenting your sleep architecture even more: you wake up groggy and then struggle to fall asleep at night.

Instead, short, intentional rest breaks (15–30 minutes) work better with this physiology. Lie down, eyes closed, phone away, but don’t aim for a full sleep cycle. Give your parasympathetic nervous system (your “rest-and-digest” mode) a quick chance to lower sensory overload without fully resetting your internal clock. The goal is a controlled micro-off switch, not disappearing into the couch dimension.

⸻

**4. Gentle movement as circulation support, not punishment**

With progesterone relaxing blood vessels, lying completely still can make you feel more woozy and heavy. Your muscles are basically tiny pumps that help move blood back up to the heart and brain. This is especially relevant because progesterone causes venous dilation (your veins are more relaxed), so without muscle contractions helping squeeze blood upward (the skeletal muscle pump), more blood tends to pool in your legs.

Light movement — short walks, stretching, easy prenatal yoga — helps your circulation. It also supports uterine and placental blood flow, improves mood and sleep quality, your cardiovascular system that is “mid-remodel” and can slightly ease nausea and constipation for some people.

⸻

**5. Smaller, more frequent meals to avoid glucose crashes**

The forming placenta is metabolically greedy. Progesterone slows gut motility, and shifting insulin sensitivity can affect glucose regulation. Big, infrequent meals are more likely to cause sudden blood sugar spikes and crashes, plus that leaden “post-meal coma” feeling.

Smaller, more frequent meals or snacks with protein + complex carbs + some fat gives you a smoother energy curve. Goal is to avoid that violent swing in glucose on top of a slow mo. Small upgrades: instead of just toast, toast with nut butter; instead of just fruit, fruit plus yogurt or cheese.

⸻

**6. If you’re using caffeine, use it strategically**

Many guidelines suggest keeping caffeine around ≤200 mg/day (roughly one 12 oz coffee — always confirm with your provider). It works by blocking adenosine receptors, the chemical that builds sleep pressure over the day.

Critical note: caffeine metabolism changes during pregnancy. While the dramatic slowing peaks in the third trimester (when the half-life roughly doubles), your liver is already prioritizing other tasks. The same cup of coffee may stay in your system longer, meaning the risk of disrupting nighttime sleep quality or increasing jitters is higher. If you choose to have it, use it earlier in the day in modest, consistent doses.

Think of it as a short-term functional tool, not a fix for the underlying endocrine changes.

⸻

**7. Treat energy budgeting as physiology, not personality**

Once you accept that your brain is being actively sedated and your metabolism is feeding an organ you’re building from scratch, “doing less” stops being a moral failure and starts being basic physiology. Trying to maintain your pre-pregnancy workload without adjustment is like ignoring a new line item in a budget and wondering why you’re overdrawn.

So a few potentially impossible things like:

- Saying no more often
- Outsourcing where you can
- Letting some tasks be “good enough”
- Shrinking your social obligations for a while

These are not indulgences. They are practical accommodations for your current metabolic reality.

This isn’t a new insight: many traditional cultures built in “confinement” or “lying-in” periods around pregnancy or postpartum where women were shielded from heavy labor and expected to rest, with protection and help assumed rather than negotiated. The physiology hasn’t changed — Western culture just stopped protecting it.

⸻

**8. When to flag it**

Most first-trimester fatigue resolves as the placenta stabilizes. But if you’re struggling to get out of bed most days, experiencing significant breathlessness or dizziness, or if exhaustion comes paired with persistent low mood or loss of interest, that warrants evaluation. Pregnancy acts as a stress test — anemia, thyroid issues, and mood disorders often surface under this new metabolic strain. Identifying them early is part of caring for the pregnancy, not separate from it.

⸻

If Part 1 was, “You’re not lazy; your brain and circulation are being actively rewritten,” then Part 2 is: given that reality, here’s how to live inside the fog with a little more strategy and a little less self-blame.

⸻

**Quick version: what helps with first trimester fog**

🧪 Rule out fixable problems (iron/ferritin, thyroid, B12, vitamin D)

💧 Hydration + electrolytes (support circulating volume)

🛑 Short rest breaks (15–30 min instead of long naps)

🚶‍♀️ Light movement (mechanical assist for circulation)

🥑 Frequent small meals (protein + complex carbs to stop the crash)

☕ Strategic caffeine (use it earlier; your metabolism is slowing)

📉 Ruthless energy budgeting (treat rest as a physiological mandate)

🚩 Flag it (if fatigue comes with breathlessness, severe dizziness, or mood changes)

Not a cure, but small mechanical assists for a system mid-remodel.",8,1763566934.0,july2026bumpers,1,0.9,False

We have a coffee date Friday. How can I even begin to fix this?,"Hey everyone, I need some serious advice because I know I messed up badly and I want to try to make things right.

About five months ago, I met this amazing girl, let's call her Lucia, through a friend. I'm 25 and she's 34. The chemistry was undeniable and instant. We started dating, and things were incredible. We'd talk every day until the early hours, either by text or call. Sometimes she would even wait for me after work just so we could see each other for a little while.

We kissed, were physically affectionate, and had an amazing connection. She was so into it that she'd even drop hints about me coming over to her place... but for one reason or another, it never happened.

And this is where I screwed up, big time.

There was this other girl [20F], a former coworker of mine. Long story short, I ended up sleeping with her. And to make it a thousand times worse, I casually told Lucia about it afterwards, and even tried to kiss her as if nothing serious had happened.

Obviously, she was completely devastated. It made her feel like I was just using her and playing games with her heart.

For the last two months, she's been distant, cold, and short with me. The confusing part is that she still agrees to see me. She lets me hug her, touch her, and I've even kissed her on the cheek, but not on the lips. I've been trying to give her space and not text her all the time, but then she tells me she thinks I don't want to be with her anymore.

After giving her some space, we talked on the phone for almost three hours yesterday. At the end, she agreed to meet me this Friday for coffee to talk in person, and she asked me to drive her home afterwards.

The truth is, I really want to do things right this time. But I have no idea if I can ever regain her trust.

Do you have any advice on what I should and shouldn't do on this coffee date?",0,1763566918.0,dating_advice,7,0.33,False

I'm looking for a fairly affordable lens, hopefully 100 dollars or so (if that's unrealistic call me out on it) that is pretty versatile. I'd like to take photos of things like cars, cool city buildings/landscapes, sunsets, pictures of my friends, insides of nice coffee shops, etc. I know that one lens isn't probably ideal for ALL of these things, but it would be great to be pointed in the right direction.

*“That was Antipop Consortium with ‘Ghostlawns.’ Futuristic sounds for a tale of past times, delivered by your faithful friends at Radio PC. Did you love it as much as I did? Are you anxious to hear another song? If so, please listen on. As your ever-loving DJ, I promise to continue spinning an eclectic arrangement of top tracks, all thematically relevant to the story at hand.”*

 

Emmett was in bed now, his eyes pointed at the ceiling, seeing beyond the plaster. He wished that he’d saved all his old yearbooks, so that he could see his friends exactly as they’d been in elementary school. 

 

The mysterious narrative still perplexed him, but he knew that he’d listen for its entire duration. He had no other choice. Even if the story took weeks to complete, he would keep the headphones jammed into his ears, would even skip work if he had to. 

 

Whether the ghost stuff was true or not, there was definitely something strange going on. Some mysterious intelligence possessed far too much information about those bygone days, an unnamed DJ whose voice still seemed off. The fact that the DJ had started the story just after Emmett discovered the station couldn’t be mere coincidence. Perhaps the DJ himself was a ghost, with an urgent message to impart. 

 

What little he could remember of those days supported the broadcast. He remembered the night they’d gone toilet papering, remembered the way his stomach had lurched when Douglas plummeted headfirst from the swing. But Emmett had never once seen a ghost, though the tale claimed that they’d been all around him. He’d never seen someone levitate, or felt the chill of a poltergeist’s presence.

 

For just a moment, he wondered if the ghosts had been racist, had ignored him strictly because of his skin color. Immediately, he realized the thought’s absurdity. Surely there’d been black phantoms among the spirits. Maybe Emmett had been too closed-minded at the time to register the hauntings. Maybe he should stop worrying about it, and just enjoy the story. 

 

*“Continuing our tale, let us hop forward a couple of weeks. That’s right, no account of elementary school would be complete without mentioning the wonder of fifth-grade camp.*  

 

*“Douglas enjoyed fifth-grade camp immensely. Emmett and he shared a cabin with half a dozen boys from surrounding schools, boys who’d never heard of Douglas’ strange birth. Thus, he found himself with temporary friendships stretching for five straight days.* 

 

*“With over two hundred kids running rampant, supervised by counselors just a handful of years their senior, the mischief potential was high. Every morning featured a fresh pair of underpants atop the flagpole. Every night, the counselors snuck out for drinking and opposite sex fraternization. The teachers kept mainly to themselves, showing up only for meals and camp activities.* 

 

*“There were lectures, sure, covering topics such as diversity and conflict resolution, but no one paid them much attention. One night, each cabin had to devise a skit based on acceptance of others, performances more painful than amusing. Likewise, the group’s campfire sing-along was too corny to be believed.* 

 

*“Douglas enjoyed the hikes the most. Crossing streams on overturned tree trunks proved exhilarating, as did sprinting up a rock formation signifying some bygone Native American right of passage. There were movie nights, cinnamon rolls in the morning, meadows, pines and firs. While no bears appeared, Douglas saw squirrels, raccoons and deer roaming about, and even spied a gray fox from a distance. In Doane Pond, he viewed a multitude of fish in constant motion: trout, Bluegill, and catfish mostly.*  

 

*“Best of all, Douglas glimpsed not a single specter on Palomar Mountain. No agonized faces in the mirror, no little girl with only half a face, not even a hovering howler. Phantom whispers assailed him not; the white-masked demoness made no appearance. Unfortunately, that respite was short lived…”*    

 

\*          \*          \*

 

In Campanula Elementary’s parking lot, a swarm of cars, vans, and trucks waited to convey children homeward. Sunburned and dotted with insect bites, Douglas watched them leave. He waited and waited, tapping his hands against his thighs, but Carter Stanton never showed. At last, after forty-seven minutes of fruitless anticipation, Douglas gathered his sleeping bag, pillow, and black leather satchel—filled with clothes and assorted toiletries—and began the trek home. 

 

While he’d made the journey many times, Douglas could now barely trudge forward. His sleeping bag and pillow would not fit comfortably under his arm, and kept slipping down to the sidewalk. 

 

Finally, after much cursing and frustration, Douglas reached Calle Tranquila. Neighbors gawked at the shambling child, offering no conversation. 

 

Seeing his father’s Pathfinder in the driveway, Douglas grunted, enraged. He’d assumed the man was at work, but there was his vehicle, plain as day. Either he’d forgotten about picking Douglas up, or he’d deliberately stranded him. 

 

Opening the door, Douglas tossed his gear down. He began calling for his father, when a silver flash crossed his vision, accompanied by a whoosh of air. 

 

“Whoa,” he exhaled, stepping back for clarity. The silver blur struck again, mere inches from Douglas’ nose. Jumping back through the doorway, he saw his assailant clearly: a wild-eyed, snarling lunatic. “Dad, stop! What’s wrong with you?”

 

Carter advanced, thumping an aluminum bat against his palm. His eyes were bloodshot; he reeked of sweat and strong liquor. 

 

“It’s Douglas! It’s your son!” 

 

Carter twisted back for another swing, which Douglas terminated with an arm grasp. “Don’t do it, Dad. It’s me.”

 

His face slackening, Carter dropped the bat. His arms fell to his sides. “Douglas? *Douglas?* I thought you were at camp.”

 

“Camp’s over. You were supposed to pick me up.” With the danger gone, Douglas closed the door. He hoped that their neighbors hadn’t overheard too much. It wouldn’t do to have two parents in a madhouse. 

 

Carter slid slowly down the wall, until he was seated upon the travertine, his knees drawn to his chest. He began to laugh, harsh guffaws that brought tears streaming down his cheeks. “I was…I was supposed to pick you up. Pick *you* up.”

 

“What’s wrong with you, Dad? What happened?”   

 

“What happened, he asks. I’ll tell you what’s happening, sonny boy. Ghosts are happening. I see them all over Oceanside. I’ve seen them since the day you were born.”

 

“I see them, too. They’re not that bad, for the most part.”

 

“Oh, but they are. Don’t you understand, Douglas? I’ve tried to have a positive attitude lately, I really have. But we can’t have any privacy with those fuckers constantly popping out of thin air. Yesterday, when I was taking a piss, I saw a bloody-eyed ghoul in the toilet. Three nights ago, I heard my pillow laughing. I’ve seen pale men in our backyard, headless torsos convulsing across our living room. Just before you got here, something tossed me out of bed. I watched my mattress float to the ceiling, while an unseen force pinned me to the ground. I guess that’s why I snapped when you walked in; I thought you were another apparition. God, I could have killed you.”

 

“It’s okay, Dad, I understand. But there’s a bright side to all this, too.”

 

“Yeah? What?”

 

“If we’re seeing ghosts, then that means some part of us will still be around after death. We don’t just evaporate. Our essence lives on.”

 

“I *never* want to be like that, forced to walk the Earth without a body.”

 

Douglas awkwardly patted his father’s head, the same way that one would acknowledge an aging canine. “You don’t have to. You could let the Phantom Cabinet take you, let it break your soul apart to construct a whole bunch of new people.”

 

“The Phantom Cabinet? You’ve been watching too many cartoons, boy.”

 

“No, it’s true. I’ve…”

 

“That’s enough, Douglas. Go wash up now; you’re filthy. When you’re done, we’ll get something to eat.”

 

Sighing, Douglas acquiesced. Setting off toward the bathroom, he heard his father begin to giggle. It was a frightening sound. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Three weeks later, Douglas returned from school to hear a ringing phone. Snatching it from its cradle, he placed the receiver to his ear.

 

“Hello.”

 

“Douglas, my man! This is Benjy.”

 

“Hey, Benjy. What’s up?”

 

“You know it’s my birthday on Friday…right?”

 

“Sure do. Are you calling about a gift?”

 

“Of course not. I know you’ll get me something great. No, I’m trying to invite you to my birthday party. My parents are taking me to Steadfast Pizza, over in Carlsbad, and I’m inviting a bunch of kids from school.”

 

“Sure, I’ll go. Can your parents give me a ride?”

 

“Yeah, we’ll pick you up. No problem.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Friday’s final school bell sounded, Douglas raced home. After a quick shower, he found himself standing before the bathroom mirror, trying on shirt after shirt after shirt. Just as he settled upon a faded white Polo—a hand-me-down from his father—the phone rang. 

 

“Hello?” 

 

“Is Douglas there?” a female voice inquired. 

 

“You’re talking to him.”

 

“Oh. Hi…Douglas, this is Missy.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“Listen, I’m calling because Benjy canceled his birthday party. He asked me to tell you.”

 

“Really? I was with him at lunch, and he couldn’t stop talking about it.”

 

“Well, it’s cancelled.” Missy hung up then, leaving Douglas sputtering on an empty line. 

 

Eleven minutes later, there was a knock at the door.

 

“Dude, you ready?” asked Benjy, wearing a new leather jacket, under what looked like two gallons of hair cream.

 

“I thought your party was cancelled.”

 

“Huh? Why would you think that?”

 

“Missy Peterson just called and said so.”

 

“She was just messing with you, bro. Now come on.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Entering Steadfast Pizza, Douglas was overwhelmed by visual stimuli. News clippings, photographs, and trophies crowded the walls, celebrating a couple of decades of the Carlsbad community. Televisions were mounted amongst them, synchronized to display football skirmishing. Arcade games filled the eatery’s far end, operated by screaming children.   

 

Douglas and Benjy were led to a row of pushed-together tables, where three pitchers of soda awaited. As they made desultory conversation with Benjy’s parents, students from Campanula Elementary began streaming in. A pile of colorfully wrapped presents formed. Soon, four pizzas arrived.  

 

Emmett was there, of course. So were Missy Peterson, Starla Smith, Karen Sakihama and Etta Williams. Mike Munson showed up, as did Kevin Jones and Marty McGuire. When Emily Mortimer arrived, holding the hand of an aged male relative, Kevin began to chuckle. 

 

“Why’d you invite the spaz?” he asked.

 

“I didn’t want you to feel left out,” Benjy countered, as the relative kissed Emily and left the restaurant, stopping only to introduce himself to the Rothsteins. 

 

After the initial pizza distribution, the last arrivals staggered in: Clark Clemson and Milo Black, their faces flushed with probable intoxication. Clark slapped Douglas’ back as they passed, hard enough to leave a welt. 

 

“What’s up, Ghost Boy?” he bellowed.

 

The kids ate pizza, played arcade games, and refilled their soda glasses continuously. Then, after a rousing rendition of “Happy Birthday,” it was time for presents.

 

Douglas gifted Benjy a stack of comics, including a fourth printing edition of *The Death of Superman*. Emmett gave him *Super Mario Land*, a Game Boy game. As shredded wrapping paper accumulated, Benjy unveiled CDs, videocassettes, candy, and an unwanted Bible from Emily. When the last present had been opened—a whoopee cushion from Clark and Milo—Benjy’s parents announced that they’d be waiting in the Volvo.

 

Throughout the evening, Missy had neither spoken to nor glanced at Douglas. He hadn’t dared to ask her about the phone call. Perhaps she hated him so much that she couldn’t even stand his proximity. 

 

“Thank God they’re finally gone,” said Benjy. From his sweatshirt’s kangaroo pouch pocket, he drew forth a glass bottle. Waving stray classmates back to the table, he told the girls to space themselves between the boys.

 

“We’re gonna play a little game,” he announced. “You guys ready to spin this bottle?”

 

“No way,” complained Missy. “I’m not playing if there’s a chance I have to kiss Ghost Boy.” 

 

“Me neither,” announced Starla, haughtily.

 

Clark chimed in: “You heard them, dipshit. Go wait in the car with Benjy’s parents. Nobody wants you here.”

 

“Bullshit,” snapped Benjy. “Douglas is one of my best friends, and if he’s not going to play, no one will.”

 

“Yeah, shut up, Clark,” said Emmett, scowling. 

 

Starla climbed out of her chair. “Let’s go play some video games,” she demanded, her petite mouth drawn thin. 

 

“I’m with you,” said Missy. “Come on, Etta.”

 

Etta glanced from Missy to Emmett. “I’m staying here,” she said. 

 

Their noses held high, Starla and Missy strode off, leaving eight boys and three girls at the table. 

 

“Damn, they had to go and throw off the balance,” said Mike Munson. His dark hair was immaculately parted, revealing a ruler-straight line of pallid scalp. 

 

“Why don’t I play a video game?” Douglas whispered to Benjy. “I don’t want to ruin your party.”

 

“You’re not ruining anything. Those chicks knew we’d be playing Spin the Bottle; I told them this morning. If they want to exclude my buddy, then fuck ’em.”

 

Now Missy’s call made sense. She’d wanted to play Spin the Bottle, just not with Douglas. 

 

“Besides,” said Emmett, “we still have three beautiful ladies to smooch.” He winked at Etta and she looked at the table, embarrassed.  

 

“Two of them, anyway,” said Marty McGuire, an obvious jab at Emily. 

 

As the birthday boy, Benjy took the first spin. He found himself locking lips with Karen, knocking her wire-rimmed glasses from her head in the process. Etta spun next, with her bottle landing on Milo. Clearly disappointed, the girl gave him a quick peck. Next, Kevin gave the bottle a spin. It landed on Emmett, so he got another try. That spin landed on Karen, who remembered to remove her glasses. 

 

Marty kissed Emily; Emily kissed Emmett. When Clark got a chance to kiss Karen, he grabbed the back of her head, thrusting his tongue deep within her mouth. When he finally pulled away, the girl looked positively nauseous, dry heaving to the sound of Milo’s raucous laughter. 

 

Then it was Douglas’ turn. Never having been kissed before, he was a bundle of quivering nerves. His hand was so sweat-slickened that he could barely grip the bottle.

 

“Spin it, pussy!” cried Milo. “What, you afraid of girls or something?”

 

“No, I’m not afraid of you,” was Douglas’ lame retort. He wiped his hand on his shirt and gripped the bottle. Just as he was about to revolve it, a hand fell upon his shoulder. 

 

Douglas looked up to see the friendly face of a Steadfast Pizza employee. “I’m sorry, kids, but you can’t be making out in our restaurant. There are families here.”

 

Clark and Milo booed vociferously, but the man was unfazed. Missy and Starla stood just behind him, obviously responsible for spoiling Douglas’ big moment. 

 

After confiscating the bottle, the employee walked away, leaving the children nothing to do but play video games. One by one, their parents arrived to retrieve them. 

 

Just before Emily left, she pulled Douglas aside. “I’m sorry that you didn’t get a kiss. I’ll kiss you now, if you want.”

 

Reddening with embarrassment, Douglas said, “I guess so.” The girl pecked him on the lips, and then skipped out of the restaurant alongside her male relative. 

 

“Did you boys have fun?” asked Mr. Rothstein on the drive home. 

 

“I sure did. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.”

 

“And you, Douglas?”

 

“Yeah, it was great,” he replied, still tasting lip gloss and tomato sauce. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as Douglas replayed the day’s events in lieu of slumber, a black tendril swam from the shadows to caress his cheek. The tendril trailed up to a porcelain mask, drifting in wafts of putrescence. 

 

Floating in a relentlessly churning shroud, the entity addressed Douglas. *“You’re beginning to see, aren’t you? No matter how hard you try, you’ll never fit in. The pretty girls will never touch you, would prefer to forget you entirely. The best that you can hope for is a pity kiss.”*

 

Douglas knew that argumentation was useless. And so he lay silently, hoping to ignore the intruder into oblivion. 

 

*“You and I have a grand destiny set before us, boy. Through your body, I will rock the globe from its orbit. You will come to see the world as I do, see mankind for what it truly is: a failed experiment awaiting extinction.”*

 

The white mask floated closer, to press against Douglas’ face. Its touch was so glacial that, even as his bladder voided into his sheets, Douglas still couldn’t escape the chill. 

 

He blinked and the intruder was gone, leaving Douglas’ sour urine stench permeating the room. Tears cascaded down his face, accompanied by ugly-sounding sobs. 

 

On trembling limbs, Douglas lurched up from the bed. Grimacing, he stripped it down to the mattress. It was time to do some laundry.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The following Monday, Douglas and Emmett sat at a lunch table, having abandoned the playground for the foreseeable future. Conversations surrounded them, but the duo sat quietly, their thoughts sailing along divergent streams. 

 

It was cheeseburger day. Their trays held the remains of burgers and fries, ketchup spread in abstract smears. Around Douglas’ tray, a fly sluggishly flew, buzzing to acknowledge its repast.

 

Curiously, even though the lunch period was almost over, Benjy still hadn’t arrived. He’d been in class earlier, yet had lingered behind as they’d headed to the cafeteria. Whether he was ditching for the rest of the day or had gone to the nurse’s office, neither boy knew. 

 

As he idly drummed his fingers against the plastic tabletop, Emmett actually found himself anxious for the bell to ring. Without Benjy around to liven things up, Douglas was kind of a drag to be around. He was so withdrawn, so socially awkward, that it took a forceful personality such as Benjy’s to bring him even partially out of his shell. 

 

Douglas stared forward, seeing nothing. Instead, his thoughts were on the porcelain-masked entity. He’d seen an edited version of *The Exorcist* recently, and wondered if he could be rid of his nocturnal visitor by performing his own holy ritual. 

 

Persuading a priest to perform an exorcism would be too embarrassing, but Douglas could easily get ahold of a Bible and some holy water. From there, he could imitate the actions of Fathers Merrin and Karras. But would the gambit work, or would it just anger the entity, provoking her toward further acts of psychological terrorism?

 

Lost in their own musings, the two friends were oblivious to Benjy’s arrival. Only after the boy distinctly cleared his throat did their eyes fall upon him. 

 

“Whoa, what the heck?” asked Emmett. For their pal had not arrived alone. Their hands tightly linked, Benjy and Karen Sakihama stood boldly at the table’s head, sharing sidelong glances.

 

“I asked Karen out,” Benjy said matter-of-factly. 

 

“She’s your girlfriend now?” asked Douglas.

 

“She is.”

 

With Benjy’s girth and Karen’s compact body, the pairing was comically incongruous. Her thin fingers disappeared within his meaty paw; her head barely came up to Benjy’s shoulders. Still, they seemed happy, and neither Emmett nor Douglas could begrudge that.

 

“Why don’t you guys sit down?” Emmett suggested. The couple acquiesced, sliding onto a bench, wrapping their arms around each other. 

 

For the rest of the lunch period, Benjy and Karen had eyes only for one another. They whispered quietly amongst themselves, so subdued that their conversation remained private. Douglas and Emmett found themselves in the same situation as before, letting the minutes spin out slowly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Frank, you’re back!”

 

The apparition hovered in his gleaming white spacesuit, his smile strained under its visor.

 

*“It’s good to see you, Douglas.”*

 

“Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in forever.”

 

Gordon sighed. *“I’ve been with the rest of the spooks, trapped within your scrawny little body. The bitch in the white mask is growing stronger, and she’s making it harder for me to manifest. I don’t think she wants you to see a friendly face.”*

 

Douglas flicked off the television. The thought of the porcelain-masked entity made him break out in flop sweat. “You know her? Why won’t she leave me alone?”

 

*“Do you remember that conversation we had, the one I told you to write down?”*

 

“Sure I do. I reread it all the time.”

 

*“Good. Do you remember when I told you that some parts of an individual’s personality don’t dissolve into the spirit foam?”*

 

“Yeah, you said that they merge together to form demons and other scary things.”

 

*“True. There are some personality components that won’t fit inside an infant. They only come into existence later, after long-term exposure to the evils of the world. A newborn knows nothing about terror or hatred. As it is, they can barely cope with the massiveness of the world beyond the womb.* 

 

*“Anyway, those traits are unneeded in crafting a new soul. Instead, they float around the Phantom Cabinet, seeking out similar traits. When enough of them come together, they can amalgamate. The results are never pleasant, and are responsible for many of mankind’s most terrifying nightmares.*

 

*“Of all those entities, that white-masked cunt is probably the worst. She’s not even really a woman, just something claiming that form. No, that rotten bitch is built from the hatreds and fears of millions of torture victims, people who’ve been forced to endure some of the sickest punishments imaginable.* 

 

*“Think about it, Douglas. While most of us find both positive and negative qualities in those we encounter, that mangled old hag only sees the negative. She knows nothing of love, nothing of kindness. She only knows razor kisses, the pain of an eyeball being gouged from one’s head, and other such agonies.”*

 

“Ouch.”

 

*“Ouch indeed. Imagine the madness that arises after hours of torture. Now imagine that madness multiplied by millions of lifetimes. That’s what you’re dealing with here.”*

 

“And how do you know so much about her?”

 

*“Oh, I know all of the entities inside you. It’s impossible to be in such constant proximity and not absorb at least some kind of impression. Especially this bitch; she radiates agony and terror like a busted nuclear reactor.*

 

*“She remembers concentration camps—the burn of Sachsenhausen mustard gas, having her muscles removed without anesthesia at Ravensbrück. In 70 AD, she was crucified along Appian Way, under the orders of a vicious bastard named Crassus.* 

 

*“She’s been placed inside a metal coffin, to be slowly eaten by animals. She’s worn a Spanish Boot, sat upon a Judas Cradle, smiled the Glasgow Smile, and languished inside an Iron Maiden. In China, she suffered a slow death by over three thousand cuts. She’s been impaled, had her bones shattered upon the breaking wheel, roasted inside a Brazen Bull.* 

 

*“Imagine being whipped, hung from meat hooks, raped to death, boiled alive, burned at the stake, flayed, disemboweled, and having your limbs pulled from their sockets. Now imagine reliving that suffering over and over again, all throughout eternity. That’s her mind state.”*

 

“Sheesh. I mean…what am I supposed to say to that? Isn’t there any way to get rid of her?”

 

*“None that I’m aware of. She’ll always be around, trying to influence you. The important thing is to ignore her. You’re a good kid, Douglas, and you need to hold onto that, no matter what the cost.”*

 

“I’ll try.”

 

*“Good. That’s good.”*

 

Douglas brightened up. “Anyway, I’m glad you came to visit. I’ve missed you, Frank. None of the other ghosts are any fun; most of them are pretty damn freaky. Can you hang out for a while?”

 

*“I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to manifest, but I’ll try to hold onto this form for a bit. Tell me, what’s been happening with our old friends, the X-Men?”*

 

“Oh, man. You gotta hear what happened to Wolverine. Magneto pulled all the adamantium out of his body…when they were fighting in outer space. Then Professor X got really mad, and he…”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

On Saturday morning, Benjy woke up facedown on his living room coffee table, drooling onto the mahogany. His eyes itched and his throat was sore, so he went to the kitchen for a drink. The area was empty; his parents were still asleep. 

 

Nestled between the milk and apple cider was a carton of orange juice, which looked pretty damn refreshing. He pulled a glass from the cupboard and began to pour. What emerged was not orange at all. Instead, the liquid was blood red. Highly viscous, it poured slowly, coating the side of the glass.   

 

Dry heaving, Benjy returned the carton to the fridge. From past experience, he knew that his parents would see plain old orange juice when they poured, but that thought provided him small comfort. 

 

He pulled a chair to the fridge, to reach the cupboards above it. The cupboards contained a vast alcohol assortment, including Triple Sec, vodka, tequila, Scotch, bourbon, wine, Jägermeister and Kahlua. Benjy rooted around until he located a half-filled bottle of Jack Daniel’s. 

 

He took a deep swig of whiskey, which sent him into a fit of explosive coughing. When he could breathe again, he took another gulp, and then put the bottle back. 

 

The liquor made his thoughts pleasantly hazy, blurring his sleepwalking concerns. Still, memories of a shifting tree and levitating sleeping bag tried to surface, so he picked up the phone. 

 

“Hello,” answered Mr. Sakihama, after four rings.  

 

“Hello, sir. Is Karen there?”

 

“Who’s this?”

 

“Benjy, sir.”

 

“Hold on.” The man’s altered cadence made his aversion obvious. 

 

A minute passed, and then: “Hello? Benjy?”

 

“Good morning, Karen. I was just thinking about you.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yeah, I was. In fact, I think I might love you.”

 

She giggled. “That’s so sweet. Seriously, you’re…*adorable*. Hey, what did you have for breakfast?”

 

“Pancakes,” he lied, even as his stomach growled. 

 

“I had oatmeal, but I put syrup on it, so it was kind of like pancakes.”

 

“Gross. Hey, do you want to do something later? I could get my mom to drop us off at the movies.”

 

“Hmmm…that sounds…fun. I have a piano lesson at three, but we can go after that. Maybe we can get some dinner, too.”

 

“Great. I’ll talk to ya later.”

 

“Bye-bye, Benjy.”

 

“Bye.”

 

He replaced the phone in its cradle, swung his arms at his sides, and then climbed the chair to filch a third swig of whiskey. With that accomplished, he decided on another call.

 

“Hello,” bellowed an angry voice at the line’s other end.

 

“Is this Clark?”

 

“No, this is his father. Who the fuck are you?”

 

“I’m his friend; that’s all you need to know. Hey, is he home?”

 

“Listen, you shrimp prick. You better learn some respect…before I feed you your fuckin’ teeth. I was trying to sleep. Now I have to deal with this shit?” 

 

There was some muffled conversation, and then: “Milo, is that you?”

 

“It’s Benjy. What’s up, Clark?”

 

“What’s going on, Fat Boy? I was just thinking about your birthday. Remember when I frenched your girlfriend? My tongue was halfway down her throat, practically in her stomach. I bet that’s further than you’ve gone with her, you fuckin’ wuss.”

 

“Yeah, but not as far as you’ve gone with your pit bull. How’s Brutus doing these days, anyway? Is he able to walk yet?”

 

“Fuck you.”

 

“Right back atcha.”

 

“Are you calling for a reason, or just looking to get your ass beat? Bring Ghost Boy along and I’ll make it a two-for-one deal.”

 

“That’s okay. Actually, I’m looking to get out of the house. Do you have any plans today?”

 

“Yeah, I’m meeting up with Milo in a little bit, and we’re going to chuck rocks at cars. Last time, we cracked some fruitcake’s window and almost caused an accident. It was hilarious. This other time, we stuck a boulder in the middle of the road and some dumb bitch ran it over. It tore up her undercarriage and left motor oil all over the place. She had to have it towed and everything.”

 

“Awesome. And you guys never got caught?”

 

“Naw. We’ve been chased before, but always got away. With a good hiding spot, we’ll be fine. You in?”

 

“Definitely.”

 

“Be at my house by ten, and make sure you bring your bike.”

 

“Got it.”

 

“Later, bitch.”

*“That was Antipop Consortium with ‘Ghostlawns.’ Futuristic sounds for a tale of past times, delivered by your faithful friends at Radio PC. Did you love it as much as I did? Are you anxious to hear another song? If so, please listen on. As your ever-loving DJ, I promise to continue spinning an eclectic arrangement of top tracks, all thematically relevant to the story at hand.”*

 

Emmett was in bed now, his eyes pointed at the ceiling, seeing beyond the plaster. He wished that he’d saved all his old yearbooks, so that he could see his friends exactly as they’d been in elementary school. 

 

The mysterious narrative still perplexed him, but he knew that he’d listen for its entire duration. He had no other choice. Even if the story took weeks to complete, he would keep the headphones jammed into his ears, would even skip work if he had to. 

 

Whether the ghost stuff was true or not, there was definitely something strange going on. Some mysterious intelligence possessed far too much information about those bygone days, an unnamed DJ whose voice still seemed off. The fact that the DJ had started the story just after Emmett discovered the station couldn’t be mere coincidence. Perhaps the DJ himself was a ghost, with an urgent message to impart. 

 

What little he could remember of those days supported the broadcast. He remembered the night they’d gone toilet papering, remembered the way his stomach had lurched when Douglas plummeted headfirst from the swing. But Emmett had never once seen a ghost, though the tale claimed that they’d been all around him. He’d never seen someone levitate, or felt the chill of a poltergeist’s presence.

 

For just a moment, he wondered if the ghosts had been racist, had ignored him strictly because of his skin color. Immediately, he realized the thought’s absurdity. Surely there’d been black phantoms among the spirits. Maybe Emmett had been too closed-minded at the time to register the hauntings. Maybe he should stop worrying about it, and just enjoy the story. 

 

*“Continuing our tale, let us hop forward a couple of weeks. That’s right, no account of elementary school would be complete without mentioning the wonder of fifth-grade camp.*  

 

*“Douglas enjoyed fifth-grade camp immensely. Emmett and he shared a cabin with half a dozen boys from surrounding schools, boys who’d never heard of Douglas’ strange birth. Thus, he found himself with temporary friendships stretching for five straight days.* 

 

*“With over two hundred kids running rampant, supervised by counselors just a handful of years their senior, the mischief potential was high. Every morning featured a fresh pair of underpants atop the flagpole. Every night, the counselors snuck out for drinking and opposite sex fraternization. The teachers kept mainly to themselves, showing up only for meals and camp activities.* 

 

*“There were lectures, sure, covering topics such as diversity and conflict resolution, but no one paid them much attention. One night, each cabin had to devise a skit based on acceptance of others, performances more painful than amusing. Likewise, the group’s campfire sing-along was too corny to be believed.* 

 

*“Douglas enjoyed the hikes the most. Crossing streams on overturned tree trunks proved exhilarating, as did sprinting up a rock formation signifying some bygone Native American right of passage. There were movie nights, cinnamon rolls in the morning, meadows, pines and firs. While no bears appeared, Douglas saw squirrels, raccoons and deer roaming about, and even spied a gray fox from a distance. In Doane Pond, he viewed a multitude of fish in constant motion: trout, Bluegill, and catfish mostly.*  

 

*“Best of all, Douglas glimpsed not a single specter on Palomar Mountain. No agonized faces in the mirror, no little girl with only half a face, not even a hovering howler. Phantom whispers assailed him not; the white-masked demoness made no appearance. Unfortunately, that respite was short lived…”*    

 

\*          \*          \*

 

In Campanula Elementary’s parking lot, a swarm of cars, vans, and trucks waited to convey children homeward. Sunburned and dotted with insect bites, Douglas watched them leave. He waited and waited, tapping his hands against his thighs, but Carter Stanton never showed. At last, after forty-seven minutes of fruitless anticipation, Douglas gathered his sleeping bag, pillow, and black leather satchel—filled with clothes and assorted toiletries—and began the trek home. 

 

While he’d made the journey many times, Douglas could now barely trudge forward. His sleeping bag and pillow would not fit comfortably under his arm, and kept slipping down to the sidewalk. 

 

Finally, after much cursing and frustration, Douglas reached Calle Tranquila. Neighbors gawked at the shambling child, offering no conversation. 

 

Seeing his father’s Pathfinder in the driveway, Douglas grunted, enraged. He’d assumed the man was at work, but there was his vehicle, plain as day. Either he’d forgotten about picking Douglas up, or he’d deliberately stranded him. 

 

Opening the door, Douglas tossed his gear down. He began calling for his father, when a silver flash crossed his vision, accompanied by a whoosh of air. 

 

“Whoa,” he exhaled, stepping back for clarity. The silver blur struck again, mere inches from Douglas’ nose. Jumping back through the doorway, he saw his assailant clearly: a wild-eyed, snarling lunatic. “Dad, stop! What’s wrong with you?”

 

Carter advanced, thumping an aluminum bat against his palm. His eyes were bloodshot; he reeked of sweat and strong liquor. 

 

“It’s Douglas! It’s your son!” 

 

Carter twisted back for another swing, which Douglas terminated with an arm grasp. “Don’t do it, Dad. It’s me.”

 

His face slackening, Carter dropped the bat. His arms fell to his sides. “Douglas? *Douglas?* I thought you were at camp.”

 

“Camp’s over. You were supposed to pick me up.” With the danger gone, Douglas closed the door. He hoped that their neighbors hadn’t overheard too much. It wouldn’t do to have two parents in a madhouse. 

 

Carter slid slowly down the wall, until he was seated upon the travertine, his knees drawn to his chest. He began to laugh, harsh guffaws that brought tears streaming down his cheeks. “I was…I was supposed to pick you up. Pick *you* up.”

 

“What’s wrong with you, Dad? What happened?”   

 

“What happened, he asks. I’ll tell you what’s happening, sonny boy. Ghosts are happening. I see them all over Oceanside. I’ve seen them since the day you were born.”

 

“I see them, too. They’re not that bad, for the most part.”

 

“Oh, but they are. Don’t you understand, Douglas? I’ve tried to have a positive attitude lately, I really have. But we can’t have any privacy with those fuckers constantly popping out of thin air. Yesterday, when I was taking a piss, I saw a bloody-eyed ghoul in the toilet. Three nights ago, I heard my pillow laughing. I’ve seen pale men in our backyard, headless torsos convulsing across our living room. Just before you got here, something tossed me out of bed. I watched my mattress float to the ceiling, while an unseen force pinned me to the ground. I guess that’s why I snapped when you walked in; I thought you were another apparition. God, I could have killed you.”

 

“It’s okay, Dad, I understand. But there’s a bright side to all this, too.”

 

“Yeah? What?”

 

“If we’re seeing ghosts, then that means some part of us will still be around after death. We don’t just evaporate. Our essence lives on.”

 

“I *never* want to be like that, forced to walk the Earth without a body.”

 

Douglas awkwardly patted his father’s head, the same way that one would acknowledge an aging canine. “You don’t have to. You could let the Phantom Cabinet take you, let it break your soul apart to construct a whole bunch of new people.”

 

“The Phantom Cabinet? You’ve been watching too many cartoons, boy.”

 

“No, it’s true. I’ve…”

 

“That’s enough, Douglas. Go wash up now; you’re filthy. When you’re done, we’ll get something to eat.”

 

Sighing, Douglas acquiesced. Setting off toward the bathroom, he heard his father begin to giggle. It was a frightening sound. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Three weeks later, Douglas returned from school to hear a ringing phone. Snatching it from its cradle, he placed the receiver to his ear.

 

“Hello.”

 

“Douglas, my man! This is Benjy.”

 

“Hey, Benjy. What’s up?”

 

“You know it’s my birthday on Friday…right?”

 

“Sure do. Are you calling about a gift?”

 

“Of course not. I know you’ll get me something great. No, I’m trying to invite you to my birthday party. My parents are taking me to Steadfast Pizza, over in Carlsbad, and I’m inviting a bunch of kids from school.”

 

“Sure, I’ll go. Can your parents give me a ride?”

 

“Yeah, we’ll pick you up. No problem.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Friday’s final school bell sounded, Douglas raced home. After a quick shower, he found himself standing before the bathroom mirror, trying on shirt after shirt after shirt. Just as he settled upon a faded white Polo—a hand-me-down from his father—the phone rang. 

 

“Hello?” 

 

“Is Douglas there?” a female voice inquired. 

 

“You’re talking to him.”

 

“Oh. Hi…Douglas, this is Missy.”

 

“Hi.”

 

“Listen, I’m calling because Benjy canceled his birthday party. He asked me to tell you.”

 

“Really? I was with him at lunch, and he couldn’t stop talking about it.”

 

“Well, it’s cancelled.” Missy hung up then, leaving Douglas sputtering on an empty line. 

 

Eleven minutes later, there was a knock at the door.

 

“Dude, you ready?” asked Benjy, wearing a new leather jacket, under what looked like two gallons of hair cream.

 

“I thought your party was cancelled.”

 

“Huh? Why would you think that?”

 

“Missy Peterson just called and said so.”

 

“She was just messing with you, bro. Now come on.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Entering Steadfast Pizza, Douglas was overwhelmed by visual stimuli. News clippings, photographs, and trophies crowded the walls, celebrating a couple of decades of the Carlsbad community. Televisions were mounted amongst them, synchronized to display football skirmishing. Arcade games filled the eatery’s far end, operated by screaming children.   

 

Douglas and Benjy were led to a row of pushed-together tables, where three pitchers of soda awaited. As they made desultory conversation with Benjy’s parents, students from Campanula Elementary began streaming in. A pile of colorfully wrapped presents formed. Soon, four pizzas arrived.  

 

Emmett was there, of course. So were Missy Peterson, Starla Smith, Karen Sakihama and Etta Williams. Mike Munson showed up, as did Kevin Jones and Marty McGuire. When Emily Mortimer arrived, holding the hand of an aged male relative, Kevin began to chuckle. 

 

“Why’d you invite the spaz?” he asked.

 

“I didn’t want you to feel left out,” Benjy countered, as the relative kissed Emily and left the restaurant, stopping only to introduce himself to the Rothsteins. 

 

After the initial pizza distribution, the last arrivals staggered in: Clark Clemson and Milo Black, their faces flushed with probable intoxication. Clark slapped Douglas’ back as they passed, hard enough to leave a welt. 

 

“What’s up, Ghost Boy?” he bellowed.

 

The kids ate pizza, played arcade games, and refilled their soda glasses continuously. Then, after a rousing rendition of “Happy Birthday,” it was time for presents.

 

Douglas gifted Benjy a stack of comics, including a fourth printing edition of *The Death of Superman*. Emmett gave him *Super Mario Land*, a Game Boy game. As shredded wrapping paper accumulated, Benjy unveiled CDs, videocassettes, candy, and an unwanted Bible from Emily. When the last present had been opened—a whoopee cushion from Clark and Milo—Benjy’s parents announced that they’d be waiting in the Volvo.

 

Throughout the evening, Missy had neither spoken to nor glanced at Douglas. He hadn’t dared to ask her about the phone call. Perhaps she hated him so much that she couldn’t even stand his proximity. 

 

“Thank God they’re finally gone,” said Benjy. From his sweatshirt’s kangaroo pouch pocket, he drew forth a glass bottle. Waving stray classmates back to the table, he told the girls to space themselves between the boys.

 

“We’re gonna play a little game,” he announced. “You guys ready to spin this bottle?”

 

“No way,” complained Missy. “I’m not playing if there’s a chance I have to kiss Ghost Boy.” 

 

“Me neither,” announced Starla, haughtily.

 

Clark chimed in: “You heard them, dipshit. Go wait in the car with Benjy’s parents. Nobody wants you here.”

 

“Bullshit,” snapped Benjy. “Douglas is one of my best friends, and if he’s not going to play, no one will.”

 

“Yeah, shut up, Clark,” said Emmett, scowling. 

 

Starla climbed out of her chair. “Let’s go play some video games,” she demanded, her petite mouth drawn thin. 

 

“I’m with you,” said Missy. “Come on, Etta.”

 

Etta glanced from Missy to Emmett. “I’m staying here,” she said. 

 

Their noses held high, Starla and Missy strode off, leaving eight boys and three girls at the table. 

 

“Damn, they had to go and throw off the balance,” said Mike Munson. His dark hair was immaculately parted, revealing a ruler-straight line of pallid scalp. 

 

“Why don’t I play a video game?” Douglas whispered to Benjy. “I don’t want to ruin your party.”

 

“You’re not ruining anything. Those chicks knew we’d be playing Spin the Bottle; I told them this morning. If they want to exclude my buddy, then fuck ’em.”

 

Now Missy’s call made sense. She’d wanted to play Spin the Bottle, just not with Douglas. 

 

“Besides,” said Emmett, “we still have three beautiful ladies to smooch.” He winked at Etta and she looked at the table, embarrassed.  

 

“Two of them, anyway,” said Marty McGuire, an obvious jab at Emily. 

 

As the birthday boy, Benjy took the first spin. He found himself locking lips with Karen, knocking her wire-rimmed glasses from her head in the process. Etta spun next, with her bottle landing on Milo. Clearly disappointed, the girl gave him a quick peck. Next, Kevin gave the bottle a spin. It landed on Emmett, so he got another try. That spin landed on Karen, who remembered to remove her glasses. 

 

Marty kissed Emily; Emily kissed Emmett. When Clark got a chance to kiss Karen, he grabbed the back of her head, thrusting his tongue deep within her mouth. When he finally pulled away, the girl looked positively nauseous, dry heaving to the sound of Milo’s raucous laughter. 

 

Then it was Douglas’ turn. Never having been kissed before, he was a bundle of quivering nerves. His hand was so sweat-slickened that he could barely grip the bottle.

 

“Spin it, pussy!” cried Milo. “What, you afraid of girls or something?”

 

“No, I’m not afraid of you,” was Douglas’ lame retort. He wiped his hand on his shirt and gripped the bottle. Just as he was about to revolve it, a hand fell upon his shoulder. 

 

Douglas looked up to see the friendly face of a Steadfast Pizza employee. “I’m sorry, kids, but you can’t be making out in our restaurant. There are families here.”

 

Clark and Milo booed vociferously, but the man was unfazed. Missy and Starla stood just behind him, obviously responsible for spoiling Douglas’ big moment. 

 

After confiscating the bottle, the employee walked away, leaving the children nothing to do but play video games. One by one, their parents arrived to retrieve them. 

 

Just before Emily left, she pulled Douglas aside. “I’m sorry that you didn’t get a kiss. I’ll kiss you now, if you want.”

 

Reddening with embarrassment, Douglas said, “I guess so.” The girl pecked him on the lips, and then skipped out of the restaurant alongside her male relative. 

 

“Did you boys have fun?” asked Mr. Rothstein on the drive home. 

 

“I sure did. Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.”

 

“And you, Douglas?”

 

“Yeah, it was great,” he replied, still tasting lip gloss and tomato sauce. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

That night, as Douglas replayed the day’s events in lieu of slumber, a black tendril swam from the shadows to caress his cheek. The tendril trailed up to a porcelain mask, drifting in wafts of putrescence. 

 

Floating in a relentlessly churning shroud, the entity addressed Douglas. *“You’re beginning to see, aren’t you? No matter how hard you try, you’ll never fit in. The pretty girls will never touch you, would prefer to forget you entirely. The best that you can hope for is a pity kiss.”*

 

Douglas knew that argumentation was useless. And so he lay silently, hoping to ignore the intruder into oblivion. 

 

*“You and I have a grand destiny set before us, boy. Through your body, I will rock the globe from its orbit. You will come to see the world as I do, see mankind for what it truly is: a failed experiment awaiting extinction.”*

 

The white mask floated closer, to press against Douglas’ face. Its touch was so glacial that, even as his bladder voided into his sheets, Douglas still couldn’t escape the chill. 

 

He blinked and the intruder was gone, leaving Douglas’ sour urine stench permeating the room. Tears cascaded down his face, accompanied by ugly-sounding sobs. 

 

On trembling limbs, Douglas lurched up from the bed. Grimacing, he stripped it down to the mattress. It was time to do some laundry.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

The following Monday, Douglas and Emmett sat at a lunch table, having abandoned the playground for the foreseeable future. Conversations surrounded them, but the duo sat quietly, their thoughts sailing along divergent streams. 

 

It was cheeseburger day. Their trays held the remains of burgers and fries, ketchup spread in abstract smears. Around Douglas’ tray, a fly sluggishly flew, buzzing to acknowledge its repast.

 

Curiously, even though the lunch period was almost over, Benjy still hadn’t arrived. He’d been in class earlier, yet had lingered behind as they’d headed to the cafeteria. Whether he was ditching for the rest of the day or had gone to the nurse’s office, neither boy knew. 

 

As he idly drummed his fingers against the plastic tabletop, Emmett actually found himself anxious for the bell to ring. Without Benjy around to liven things up, Douglas was kind of a drag to be around. He was so withdrawn, so socially awkward, that it took a forceful personality such as Benjy’s to bring him even partially out of his shell. 

 

Douglas stared forward, seeing nothing. Instead, his thoughts were on the porcelain-masked entity. He’d seen an edited version of *The Exorcist* recently, and wondered if he could be rid of his nocturnal visitor by performing his own holy ritual. 

 

Persuading a priest to perform an exorcism would be too embarrassing, but Douglas could easily get ahold of a Bible and some holy water. From there, he could imitate the actions of Fathers Merrin and Karras. But would the gambit work, or would it just anger the entity, provoking her toward further acts of psychological terrorism?

 

Lost in their own musings, the two friends were oblivious to Benjy’s arrival. Only after the boy distinctly cleared his throat did their eyes fall upon him. 

 

“Whoa, what the heck?” asked Emmett. For their pal had not arrived alone. Their hands tightly linked, Benjy and Karen Sakihama stood boldly at the table’s head, sharing sidelong glances.

 

“I asked Karen out,” Benjy said matter-of-factly. 

 

“She’s your girlfriend now?” asked Douglas.

 

“She is.”

 

With Benjy’s girth and Karen’s compact body, the pairing was comically incongruous. Her thin fingers disappeared within his meaty paw; her head barely came up to Benjy’s shoulders. Still, they seemed happy, and neither Emmett nor Douglas could begrudge that.

 

“Why don’t you guys sit down?” Emmett suggested. The couple acquiesced, sliding onto a bench, wrapping their arms around each other. 

 

For the rest of the lunch period, Benjy and Karen had eyes only for one another. They whispered quietly amongst themselves, so subdued that their conversation remained private. Douglas and Emmett found themselves in the same situation as before, letting the minutes spin out slowly. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

“Frank, you’re back!”

 

The apparition hovered in his gleaming white spacesuit, his smile strained under its visor.

 

*“It’s good to see you, Douglas.”*

 

“Where have you been? I haven’t seen you in forever.”

 

Gordon sighed. *“I’ve been with the rest of the spooks, trapped within your scrawny little body. The bitch in the white mask is growing stronger, and she’s making it harder for me to manifest. I don’t think she wants you to see a friendly face.”*

 

Douglas flicked off the television. The thought of the porcelain-masked entity made him break out in flop sweat. “You know her? Why won’t she leave me alone?”

 

*“Do you remember that conversation we had, the one I told you to write down?”*

 

“Sure I do. I reread it all the time.”

 

*“Good. Do you remember when I told you that some parts of an individual’s personality don’t dissolve into the spirit foam?”*

 

“Yeah, you said that they merge together to form demons and other scary things.”

 

*“True. There are some personality components that won’t fit inside an infant. They only come into existence later, after long-term exposure to the evils of the world. A newborn knows nothing about terror or hatred. As it is, they can barely cope with the massiveness of the world beyond the womb.* 

 

*“Anyway, those traits are unneeded in crafting a new soul. Instead, they float around the Phantom Cabinet, seeking out similar traits. When enough of them come together, they can amalgamate. The results are never pleasant, and are responsible for many of mankind’s most terrifying nightmares.*

 

*“Of all those entities, that white-masked cunt is probably the worst. She’s not even really a woman, just something claiming that form. No, that rotten bitch is built from the hatreds and fears of millions of torture victims, people who’ve been forced to endure some of the sickest punishments imaginable.* 

 

*“Think about it, Douglas. While most of us find both positive and negative qualities in those we encounter, that mangled old hag only sees the negative. She knows nothing of love, nothing of kindness. She only knows razor kisses, the pain of an eyeball being gouged from one’s head, and other such agonies.”*

 

“Ouch.”

 

*“Ouch indeed. Imagine the madness that arises after hours of torture. Now imagine that madness multiplied by millions of lifetimes. That’s what you’re dealing with here.”*

 

“And how do you know so much about her?”

 

*“Oh, I know all of the entities inside you. It’s impossible to be in such constant proximity and not absorb at least some kind of impression. Especially this bitch; she radiates agony and terror like a busted nuclear reactor.*

 

*“She remembers concentration camps—the burn of Sachsenhausen mustard gas, having her muscles removed without anesthesia at Ravensbrück. In 70 AD, she was crucified along Appian Way, under the orders of a vicious bastard named Crassus.* 

 

*“She’s been placed inside a metal coffin, to be slowly eaten by animals. She’s worn a Spanish Boot, sat upon a Judas Cradle, smiled the Glasgow Smile, and languished inside an Iron Maiden. In China, she suffered a slow death by over three thousand cuts. She’s been impaled, had her bones shattered upon the breaking wheel, roasted inside a Brazen Bull.* 

 

*“Imagine being whipped, hung from meat hooks, raped to death, boiled alive, burned at the stake, flayed, disemboweled, and having your limbs pulled from their sockets. Now imagine reliving that suffering over and over again, all throughout eternity. That’s her mind state.”*

 

“Sheesh. I mean…what am I supposed to say to that? Isn’t there any way to get rid of her?”

 

*“None that I’m aware of. She’ll always be around, trying to influence you. The important thing is to ignore her. You’re a good kid, Douglas, and you need to hold onto that, no matter what the cost.”*

 

“I’ll try.”

 

*“Good. That’s good.”*

 

Douglas brightened up. “Anyway, I’m glad you came to visit. I’ve missed you, Frank. None of the other ghosts are any fun; most of them are pretty damn freaky. Can you hang out for a while?”

 

*“I’m not sure how long I’ll be able to manifest, but I’ll try to hold onto this form for a bit. Tell me, what’s been happening with our old friends, the X-Men?”*

 

“Oh, man. You gotta hear what happened to Wolverine. Magneto pulled all the adamantium out of his body…when they were fighting in outer space. Then Professor X got really mad, and he…”

On Saturday morning, Benjy woke up facedown on his living room coffee table, drooling onto the mahogany. His eyes itched and his throat was sore, so he went to the kitchen for a drink. The area was empty; his parents were still asleep. 

 

Nestled between the milk and apple cider was a carton of orange juice, which looked pretty damn refreshing. He pulled a glass from the cupboard and began to pour. What emerged was not orange at all. Instead, the liquid was blood red. Highly viscous, it poured slowly, coating the side of the glass.   

 

Dry heaving, Benjy returned the carton to the fridge. From past experience, he knew that his parents would see plain old orange juice when they poured, but that thought provided him small comfort. 

 

He pulled a chair to the fridge, to reach the cupboards above it. The cupboards contained a vast alcohol assortment, including Triple Sec, vodka, tequila, Scotch, bourbon, wine, Jägermeister and Kahlua. Benjy rooted around until he located a half-filled bottle of Jack Daniel’s. 

 

He took a deep swig of whiskey, which sent him into a fit of explosive coughing. When he could breathe again, he took another gulp, and then put the bottle back. 

 

The liquor made his thoughts pleasantly hazy, blurring his sleepwalking concerns. Still, memories of a shifting tree and levitating sleeping bag tried to surface, so he picked up the phone. 

 

“Hello,” answered Mr. Sakihama, after four rings.  

 

“Hello, sir. Is Karen there?”

 

“Who’s this?”

 

“Benjy, sir.”

 

“Hold on.” The man’s altered cadence made his aversion obvious. 

 

A minute passed, and then: “Hello? Benjy?”

 

“Good morning, Karen. I was just thinking about you.”

 

“Really?”

 

“Yeah, I was. In fact, I think I might love you.”

 

She giggled. “That’s so sweet. Seriously, you’re…*adorable*. Hey, what did you have for breakfast?”

 

“Pancakes,” he lied, even as his stomach growled. 

 

“I had oatmeal, but I put syrup on it, so it was kind of like pancakes.”

 

“Gross. Hey, do you want to do something later? I could get my mom to drop us off at the movies.”

 

“Hmmm…that sounds…fun. I have a piano lesson at three, but we can go after that. Maybe we can get some dinner, too.”

 

“Great. I’ll talk to ya later.”

 

“Bye-bye, Benjy.”

 

“Bye.”

 

He replaced the phone in its cradle, swung his arms at his sides, and then climbed the chair to filch a third swig of whiskey. With that accomplished, he decided on another call.

 

“Hello,” bellowed an angry voice at the line’s other end.

 

“Is this Clark?”

 

“No, this is his father. Who the fuck are you?”

 

“I’m his friend; that’s all you need to know. Hey, is he home?”

 

“Listen, you shrimp prick. You better learn some respect…before I feed you your fuckin’ teeth. I was trying to sleep. Now I have to deal with this shit?” 

 

There was some muffled conversation, and then: “Milo, is that you?”

 

“It’s Benjy. What’s up, Clark?”

 

“What’s going on, Fat Boy? I was just thinking about your birthday. Remember when I frenched your girlfriend? My tongue was halfway down her throat, practically in her stomach. I bet that’s further than you’ve gone with her, you fuckin’ wuss.”

 

“Yeah, but not as far as you’ve gone with your pit bull. How’s Brutus doing these days, anyway? Is he able to walk yet?”

 

“Fuck you.”

 

“Right back atcha.”

 

“Are you calling for a reason, or just looking to get your ass beat? Bring Ghost Boy along and I’ll make it a two-for-one deal.”

 

“That’s okay. Actually, I’m looking to get out of the house. Do you have any plans today?”

 

“Yeah, I’m meeting up with Milo in a little bit, and we’re going to chuck rocks at cars. Last time, we cracked some fruitcake’s window and almost caused an accident. It was hilarious. This other time, we stuck a boulder in the middle of the road and some dumb bitch ran it over. It tore up her undercarriage and left motor oil all over the place. She had to have it towed and everything.”

 

“Awesome. And you guys never got caught?”

 

“Naw. We’ve been chased before, but always got away. With a good hiding spot, we’ll be fine. You in?”

 

“Definitely.”

 

“Be at my house by ten, and make sure you bring your bike.”

 

“Got it.”

 

“Later, bitch.”

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Indiana Pacers vs. Charlotte Hornets: A Tale of Two Turnovers and a Shoulder Subluxation**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a basketball game that’s shaping up to be as chaotic as a toddler’s art class. The Indiana Pacers, owners of the NBA’s worst record and an eight-game losing streak that’s longer than a Netflix series’ first season, host the Charlotte Hornets, who’ve somehow managed to lose three straight despite a rookie named Kon Knueppel who shoots threes like he’s playing *Fortnite* on the court. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the humor of a guy who’s seen too many bad NBA draft picks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The Hornets are the clear favorites here, with implied probabilities hovering around **55-56%** to win outright (decimal odds of \~1.82). The Pacers? They’re priced at **\~49-50%**, which, for a team that’s lost 13 of 14 games, feels like giving a goldfish a Nobel Prize. The spread is a modest **Hornets -1.5**, with nearly even moneylines, suggesting bookmakers expect a close game. The total is set at **237.5 points**, with both Over and Under priced at \~51%, meaning Vegas thinks this could go either way—probably because both teams turn the ball over more than a magician at a card factory.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Turnovers, and a Rookie’s Rise

**Indiana Pacers**:

* **Bennedict Mathurin**, their star guard, is back from a sprained toe but still looks like a guy who’s playing with one hand tied behind his back (metaphorically—let’s hope he’s not literally tying hands now). He scored 25 in his return, but that came after a first-half performance that could’ve been titled *“How to Score 2 Points in 12 Minutes.”*
* **Pascal Siakam** is dropping dimes like they’re hot (29 points vs. Detroit), but the Pacers’ **21 turnovers** vs. the Pistons were so bad, coach Rick Carlisle reportedly yelled, “Throw it to the *other* team in blue!” while watching film.
* The Pacers are the NBA’s version of a sieve on defense, allowing opponents to score **30 points off turnovers**. If this team had a slogan, it’d be *“We’ll out-lose you.”*

**Charlotte Hornets**:

* **Brandon Miller**, the former No. 2 pick, is out with a shoulder subluxation. Think of it as a “shoulder that’s taking a coffee break” for the next few weeks. The

We have a coffee date Friday. How can I even begin to fix this?,"Hey everyone, I need some serious advice because I know I messed up badly and I want to try to make things right.

About five months ago, I met this amazing girl, let's call her Lucia, through a friend. I'm 25 and she's 34. The chemistry was undeniable and instant. We started dating, and things were incredible. We'd talk every day until the early hours, either by text or call. Sometimes she would even wait for me after work just so we could see each other for a little while.

We kissed, were physically affectionate, and had an amazing connection. She was so into it that she'd even drop hints about me coming over to her place... but for one reason or another, it never happened.

And this is where I screwed up, big time.

There was this other girl [20F], a former coworker of mine. Long story short, I ended up sleeping with her. And to make it a thousand times worse, I casually told Lucia about it afterwards, and even tried to kiss her as if nothing serious had happened.

Obviously, she was completely devastated. It made her feel like I was just using her and playing games with her heart.

For the last two months, she's been distant, cold, and short with me. The confusing part is that she still agrees to see me. She lets me hug her, touch her, and I've even kissed her on the cheek, but not on the lips. I've been trying to give her space and not text her all the time, but then she tells me she thinks I don't want to be with her anymore.

After giving her some space, we talked on the phone for almost three hours yesterday. At the end, she agreed to meet me this Friday for coffee to talk in person, and she asked me to drive her home afterwards.

The truth is, I really want to do things right this time. But I have no idea if I can ever regain her trust.

1p1awds,https://www.reddit.com/r/betterCallSaul/comments/1p1awds/i_just_finished_bcs_for_the_premiere_and_its/,I just finished BCS for the premiere and it's incredible how my opinion on certain characters changed between season 1 and 6.,"1. Let's start with Chuck: I hated him to no end at the beginning of the series, not understanding why he didn't want to see his brother succeed. But having seen the end of the series I have compassion for him. In the end he was totally right about Jimmy.  His brother's bad actions led to Howard's death and the downfall of HHM (since the firm is changing its name!)
2. Kim Wexler: I liked her at first. She is very intelligent and combative but I hated what she did to Howard and especially I hated how much she was getting off on destroying a man's life! When Howard confronts them she seems to have nothing to do unlike Jimmy who displays a guilty look. After Howard's death, she lied to his wife by confirming that he was taking drugs and half-heartedly told her that she should have realized it herself! Finally I can't see her anymore. She was horrible and will pay very little for her crimes.
3. ⁠Howard: probably the one who changed my mind the most! At the beginning of the series I saw a proud and arrogant man, who kept putting obstacles in Jimmy's wheels and refused to see him work in his office. We finally discover that it is Chuck who is using Howard as a shield to push Jimmy down. In the end, he’s a super smiling and deeply empathetic guy. He is kind to everyone, whether it is his clients, an assistant in the office or even the doorman of his car! And he's the only one who had the intelligence to go to therapy after Chuck's death. The only one who really tried to work on himself. I had tears in my eyes when he made his wife a great coffee and she poured it coldly into her coffee maker. And I screamed at my screen when he was killed for nothing. In the end the firm that his father founded will no longer bear his name. Howard will forever have a reputation as a drug addict who ruined his firm even though he devoted his life to it. He was a great guy, he really didn’t deserve that!

So I just wanted to take my hat off to the writers who did a great job with the characters.

We met 14 months ago . We fell in love fast. He is 50, I am 38.I was always very independent and never wanted to get married . He has never been married either . He asked me to marry him after 3 months and we got married 8 months later . The reason I fell for him was he is a good communicator , never left me wondering , always explained everything and I had no doubts about him . I am from a broken family that moved a lot and my mom changed partners a lot , so my trust in men has always been questionable , that is probably why I fell for him hard . He included me in everything - his friends , his family and he talked about me highly to everyone . Things started to shift - or should I say his real self started to show 4 months into the relationship.

Strike 1) I got pregnant and I decided not to keep the baby . He was broken hearted because he wanted a child . While I was deciding whether or not to keep it I had a gut feeling to look into his phone (I know , I’m ashamed ) - found a conversation with his ex where he is pouring his heart to her about how I dont wanna keep the baby . Then it went into sharing memories about the times they had sex in the past . It left me shattered but I forgave him.

Strike 2) He wanted to bring me flowers but i was too busy that day so we met the next day for dinner and I casually asked where the flowers where . He told me he gave them to his friend (girl) because they would’ve died . He gave them to a friend he talks a lot to and visits her at work a lot just to talk. It didn’t bother me at first because I know he’s very social and has a lot of friends (a lot of girl friends too). On the same day we were in his car and he wanted to go use the restroom but before he went he took his phone and deleted messages from 3 girls ( i saw it as he was doing it ) . That really stabbed me and at that moment inside i wanted to end things . I told him and left and his excuse was he didn’t want me to think something . After i left he showed up at my house begging me to stay and that it really was nothing . I forgave him but never forgot about it .

Strike 3) i left to a different country for almost 3 weeks and when i came back his mom casually mentioned that he had coffee with his ex (the one he was messaging with on strike1) . I never mentioned it to him until a month later when i casually told him i talked to my ex who lives in a different country on the phone that day . He didn’t look happy and i told him he should be happy i tell him about it unlike him . He looked puzzled so i told him he saw his ex and he denied it . After i told him I knew he made an excuse that she wanted to help with her roof and he gave her contacts . Also tried to say she has a boyfriend who lives with her , so no need to worry . After this incident i told him that it doesnt bother me that he sees or talks to his exes or girlfriends but what bothers me is when he lies about it . He says his past girlfriend was very jealous and he had to hide things from her to not make her mad and that he would not lie about things like this in the future.

By then i didn’t trust him eventhough i tried , so i checked his phone again (😩) and noticed regular calls and messages where he sends happy photos of us with one female that i didn’t know . Couple of months later that name popped up as someone i may know on my facebook . I sent him the picture and asked who she was . He told me a whole story that she is their family friend. I trusted him. Few weeks later his coworked mentioned her name as her ex that he was with right before me . I got angry and kicked him out . His excuse was he didnt want me to make asumptions and that they are just friends and he’s giving her advice about her boyfriend (and probably vice versa). I didn’t care what he had to say and two hours later he BROUGHT HER into my house . She said he shouldve told me but that he loves me so much he doesnt wanna do anything to give me doubts and to loose me . I caved in again .

Strike 4)My trust in him is so broken I checked his phone again after i wanted to take a few days to settle my thoughts . When I saw him after two days I went into his phone and first thing I see is a conversation with his past coworker where she is telling him about her relationship issues and he reassures her that she’s a great woman and on top of everything she fucks good . Then he starts reminiscing on the time they fucked in the bathtub together and wants to go into details but she stopped him . After that he tried to call her the next few days but she didnt allow it . I kept it in for a month and I was boiling . When I finally exploded he said they were FWB 6 years ago . I wonder what would have happened if she did take his calls and continued ….

Now my thing is I am married to him - shortly - I do wanna trust him but it is impossible . I didn’t wanna end up like my mom who’s marriages never worked out . Now I am almost 40 - at my first marriage and i am always stressed thinking. I am happy when we are together but always thinking when he’s away for few hours because  i always wonder … This is totally unhealthy . I crossed my boundaries by checking his phone and I am not his mom to keep checking to make sure he’s acting like a husband I don’t have to be ashamed of .

She is retired, late 60s. Likes lotions and skincare but not perfumes or other beauty products. Loves coffee and cooking gadgets (Ninja foodie is her current obsession) and a bit of a health nut. Doesn’t wear jewelry and is very particular about clothing. She also loves exercise. She’s gotten into (1000+ piece) puzzles recently but has so many of them. She loves exercise and has a huge exercise room. She has a large dog that is pretty reactive.  She is a full time caregiver to her husband/my stepdad (who is getting his own gift, he’s just easier to shop for). She has quite a bit of money so usually buys whatever she wants if it looks interesting. Not super into technology- she was gifted an Alexa a few years ago and I don’t think she ever even unboxed it. 

She and my stepdad are moving long-distance sometime next year so I’m trying to avoid anything bulky or that will become just another item to move, so maybe something consumable? The move will be VERY rural Maine to Suburban Florida. I already offered my help to assist with the packing and moving so that can’t be the “gift.” I’m not sure what they’re planning in terms of moving specifics yet. 

Gifts in past years have been organizational goods and home decor, lotions and soaps, and food/snack gift sets. ",1,1763565977.0,Gifts,0,1.0,False

I rolled out of bed way too early this morning, and my body immediately filed a complaint:
“Why are we awake? And why are we leaving the house?”

Then it hit me with the classic Florida winter logic — “It’s cold… but don’t get comfy. You’ll be sweating your soul out in 20 minutes. So bring the sweater… and the tissues… because you know that sweater is coming off and your nose is gonna run like it’s training for a marathon.” 🤧😂

But hey, that’s life. You never really know what the day has planned for you. So remember this:
You are capable of amazing things — even the stuff that feels impossible before coffee. If it doesn’t go right the first time, try again. And again. And again. Persistence is basically just confidence wearing gym shorts.

If today starts a little rough, throw a smile on that beautiful face anyway. It may feel fake at first, but give it a minute… your heart will catch up.

So get out there. Be kind to others and yourself. Do the best you can, and if it’s not your day? That’s fine — there’s still time to turn it around. And if not… tomorrow’s standing by waiting its turn.

Roll on, my friends. You’ve got this. Have an amazing day! 💪✨🌈",13,1763565817.0,ThePositivityRoller,3,1.0,False

The world went sideways.

Maybe a second. Maybe two. Hard to say when time decides to get sticky. It felt like being shoved through a doorway you didn't know was there—one of those dreams where the house has extra rooms that shouldn't exist.

The dampeners snapped. The ship buckled. A weight pressed down on my skull like someone putting their boot there and forgetting to lift it.

My jaw hit something. Console, maybe. Helmet. The bone tore loose at the hinge and I *heard* it more than felt it—that wet little grinding pop, like stepping on a snail you didn't see.

And then this part that isn't right but is true: I tasted the cheap coffee from Deck 9 again. The burnt glue stuff that came out of the machine that only took credits, not the new one. I tasted the plastic cup. I tasted Thursday morning when I spilled half of it on my uniform and Vance laughed and I pretended not to care but I did.

Some blood ran into my mouth and I laughed because it tasted exactly like the vending machine sugar packets. The ones I'd steal three at a time.

I tasted my eighteenth birthday. Soy-ramen. The night my mother forgot to come home.

The tactical display didn't malfunction. It objected. It shrieked in colors I'm pretty sure don't have names yet.

411 contacts.

Except they weren't contacts. They were dents. Shapes without shapes, blurred like someone pressing thumbs into wet clay but the clay was space itself. They pulsed—rhythmic, insistent—like poking a bruise that hasn't healed.

My bones vibrated with it. My marrow trying to crawl somewhere safer.

""That's arrhythmia,"" I whispered. ""My uncle died like that. Face in the soup.""

I'm not sure I said it out loud.



**Log Mark: +00:01:45**

The *Retribution* opened fire out of fear, not protocol.

The railgun slug hit the lead anomaly and didn't explode. It just *erased* the thing. Like deleting a line on a screen but forgetting to delete the shadow it left behind.

Soft pink fog splattered across my canopy.

I thought of snow cones. That stupid mango one from the vendor on Ganymede Station who kept calling me ""Lieutenant Lemon"" because of the flight suit color. I hated that nickname.

I kind of miss it now.

""Target eliminated,"" the computer said, sounding genuinely annoyed.

""No,"" I said. ""It's juice now.""

I tried to lick the canopy. Reflex, maybe. Or something worse.



**Log Mark: +00:03:11**

Okafor came through the comms.

Whispering. Soft. Almost loving.

His ribs were cracking outward—each one a little wet snap like knuckles too close to a microphone.

""Chen... it's showing me... how I always had room... tell them... tell them I was never full... never full until—""

I answered without thinking. My mouth did it on its own.

""I knew you were empty, Okafor. I knew it the first time you stole my cigarettes and said thank you like you meant it. You're welcome. You're so welcome now.""

I laughed until the laugh turned into blood hiccups.

""You owe me five credits,"" I added, because some part of me thought that mattered.

Okafor made this wet, embarrassed little noise. Like someone trying not to cry in a bathroom stall at a party they didn't want to attend.

Then nothing.



**Log Mark: +00:05:22**

Vance dissolved.

Not exploded. Not disintegrated. Just... melted.

The spore cloud brushed his ship and his armor went soft like taffy left in the sun. His face slid off in one sheet—wet wallpaper peeling.

His seat floated away. Perfectly intact. Brand new looking, even.

I checked my bank account out of habit. Rent was three days overdue.

""Lucky bastard doesn't have to pay this month,"" I muttered. ""Or any month.""

I felt guilty for thinking it.

But I didn't stop.



**Log Mark: +00:08:15**

I tuned into the internal cams because curiosity has teeth and mine were hungry.

Deck 4 was painted red. Glossed over like someone mopped it but didn't care about streaks.

Miller was screaming, but not in fear. In *disbelief*. His voice was offended, like he'd been personally insulted by the universe.

The Tick unzipped his flight suit with careful patience. Click. Click. Very polite. Respectful, even.

I remember thinking: uniforms are expensive. That's considerate.

Then it inserted a tube.

Miller deflated like a pool toy with a slow leak.

The Tick ballooned with a disgusting, festive glow.

""You're swelling,"" I told the screen. ""It's not flattering.""

I wasn't being funny. I was honestly critiquing it.

Something in my head had already gone sideways.



**Log Mark: +00:11:47**

Space is quiet the way a locked bathroom is quiet. Muffled. Tense. Judgmental.

Ejection.

Tumbling.

Silence pressing in like cotton in my ears.

I counted the Ticks boarding through the hull breach. Named them after things I'd lost over the years.

The pen from graduation. My first houseplant—the one I forgot to water for two weeks. My old wristwatch with the cracked face. That Sunday afternoon smell when you know you have work Monday and there's nothing you can do about it.

Forty-one. Forty-two.

Then I switched. Named them after every teacher who told me I'd amount to nothing.

""I'm sorry, Mrs. Delgado,"" I whispered. ""I amounted to this. This is what nothing feels like. It's warm.""

I tried to picture my ex-wife's hair. Coconut shampoo and goodbye. The night she left.

Couldn't remember the scent.

Tried again.

Got dust. Static.

I breathed in the vacuum like maybe I could force the memory back. Like inhaling hard enough would pull her smell out of the past and into my helmet.

It didn't work.



**Log Mark: +00:20:03**

Captain Reeves was dragging herself upside-down across the CIC ceiling like she'd forgotten gravity was optional.

She left red streaks on the panels. Uneven. Messy. Too human.

She was talking to her dead daughter. Singing, maybe. Hard to tell.

I hijacked fleet-wide comms just to remind her about the expired coupons in her desk. I don't know why. It felt urgent.

""We missed the two-for-one deal, Maria. Do you understand what that means? That kind of negligence spreads.""

A crunch. A slump. Silence.

""Captain,"" I tried again. ""You still have that photo in your cabin. The one with the stupid dog. The dog died years ago. Why do you keep it? Why do we keep anything? Let them have the dog. Let them have the photo. Let them have—""

Static swallowed the rest.

""We are bleeding morale,"" I added to no one. ""And savings.""

I think I meant it.



**Log Mark: +00:38:00**

Kushner's Omega detonated.

White light. Louder than any alarm. So bright I saw it inside my eyelids, behind my eyelids, *through* my skull.

The star screamed.

My shadow peeled away and drifted through the cockpit like it had somewhere better to be.

My brain cooked.

And in the cooking—just for one clear, agonizing moment—I understood everything.

Then I forgot half of it instantly.

But I remembered the curry packet in my locker. The one with the smiling cow on the front.

""Why is she smiling?"" I whispered. ""What does she want from me? I never even opened it. I'm sorry, cow. I'm sorry I let you die unopened. They're opening me now. Fair's fair.""

I started reciting my grocery list from last shore leave.

""Milk. Eggs. That awful instant curry...""

Then I sang the jingle. Off-key. Looping. The one from the commercial that used to play at 2 AM when I couldn't sleep.

The fleet turned into glitter.

The debris looked expensive. Like something you'd buy at a gift shop and regret later.

I hummed because silence made my skin itch.



**Log Mark: +02:11:00 (Subspace Drift)**

Nine hours alone with myself.

Worst company I've ever had.

I began the inventory.

Chewed my gloves apart. Spit the bits out. Peeled my fingernails off one by one like postage stamps and stuck them to the canopy in a kind of calendar. One nail for every year I didn't visit home.

Ran out around year twelve.

I used the blood to draw on the glass.

My childhood bedroom. The crack in the ceiling that looked like an upside-down tree. Like a smile if you squinted.

My mother's hands washing dishes until the knuckles swelled red.

The burn scar on my left thigh from when I was nine and tried to cook for her and spilled the pot. The exact pattern of it. Every ridge.

I talked to the drawings because they looked like they were listening.

""I should have called more. I should have. They're calling now. Listen. Can you hear them? They sound like lullabies if you forget the words.""

Something turned over inside my abdomen.

Slow. Curious.

I pressed both palms against the swell.

""Shhh. It's okay. Uncle Elias is here. I'll teach you the curry jingle. We'll sing it together. We'll sing it until the stars forget how to be cold.""



**Log Mark: +04:30:00**

I opened the pressure seal on my chest because the pain felt humid. I wanted air.

Don't judge me. Pain makes you weird.

My abdomen rolled like there were eels inside trying to get comfortable.

Something inside touched me back when I pressed my hand to it.

""Did you bring the keys?"" I asked the movement. ""I lost mine. Someone was shouting. Maybe that was yesterday? Don't shove. I said don't shove.""

It shoved harder.



**Log Mark: +06:15:00**

Dream or memory. I don't know anymore.

My ex-wife in the kitchen. Thermostat cranked to 98. She turned around and her face had no eyes—just one long vertical mouth smiling like something that shouldn't be able to smile.

""It needs to be warmer,"" she said. ""For the dough.""

Her mouth opened. Steam poured out. Curry smell.

I woke screaming because my ribs were unzipping in real life. Skin parting like cheap fabric at the seams.

""Stuck zipper,"" I gasped. ""Need wax. Or butter.""



**Log Mark: +07:22:00**

HR contacted me. Or something using their tone.

""You have unused vacation days.""

""I know,"" I said. ""I was saving them.""

""For what?""

""A rainy day.""

Blood droplets floated around my helmet like little red balloons.

""It's raining,"" I said. ""Can I go now?""

""No. Please hold.""

I held my intestines in place obediently. Felt strangely proud of myself for following instructions.



**Log Mark: +08:44:00**

Birth.

The first one began.

My chest cavity opened like a flower. Or a wound. Maybe both.

Bone petals. Wet strings. I felt the tearing—almost gentle, like being unfolded by careful hands.

I felt my intestines part like curtains for a stage I didn't know I had.

Cool air kissed organs that had never seen light.

Four pale infants nestled inside my ribs, connecting to my arteries like I was an old house and they were new wiring. No faces. Just clicking sensory plates. Little hungry clocks.

I cried from pride. From grief. From both at once and neither.

""It's okay. Mama's not coming but I am. I'm here. I'm becoming the part that stays.""

I laughed. I cried. I sang.

""Happy birthday to me. Happy birthday to... happy... birthday... happy...""

""I'm furniture,"" I whispered. ""Sit down. I can hold you. I can hold anything if you stay.""

I didn't know if it was the pain or the relief that made me cry harder.



**Recovery Log: +09:17:00**

When they cracked the pod open, the smell hit first.

Burnt wires. Penny metal. Curry.

I was sitting upright. Bones arranged like a cradle. My ribcage spread and hinged outward on strips of my own skin.

My eyes had calcified over but I was still seeing somehow.

My mouth was moving in three directions at once.

""You're late,"" I told them. ""I started without you. Curry expires today. It's still in my locker on Deck Seven. Someone should eat it before it goes bad. Waste not want not. That's what she said. Come closer. Let me show you how warm.""

One medic vomited.

I felt offended.

""Are you going to eat that?"" I asked him. ""Don't be wasteful.""

They torched me.

I thanked them while the flames peeled my face away in sheets.

Kept thanking them until the vocal cords burned through.

My last words:

""I was always afraid of being forgotten. They fixed that. They fixed everything. Thank you. Thank you. Thankyouthankyouthank—""

Current transmission, repeating:

the story starts in a local coffee shop, my grandfather's cousin who recently dissolved his own local party to join a socialist one from west Malaysia, he recruited my grandfather to run for the state election, throughout his campaign, the villagers in our small community started faking claims about him, since most of the village people were uneducated and would blatantly believe whatever they heard, seeing my grandfather who joined a socialist party, started saying that he was a communist sent by Indonesia, this was the 70s so people r dumb, life for my grandfather and his family were rough.


Before entering the election, he owned a bookstore, one day a police force was gathered and sent to his shop, the officers started harassing him by yelling and telling everyone there that he was a communist selling communist books (laid in front of the officer were the oxford dictionary), then they said they were sent by the main police force in the capital to order him to shut down his shop, the officers also told him to not join the election bc he was ordered to by the authoritarian government, the reason he even decided to run for MP was bc back then, only one party ruled Sabah, and there were no opposition, he said that in order for democracy to work there must be an opposition in parliment, back to the book store, they were forcefully kicked out and got the books they were selling thrown out, the shop was boarded up and was graffiti by villagers tagging it a communist shop.

the night before the election, a candidate and a few men went to our old house and threw rocks and making noise.

After the election, he lost and only 47 people voted for him, this story was told by his sister (my grandmother) who was still in school that time, she would get called the sister of the communist.

Yes, if you don't want to be taken advantage of then these are reasonable solutions but in long term it hurts your dating life. 

Lets try to look at this from positive angle. At least you are on a date and gaining dating experience rather than at home playing computer games or something. Just because a girl came with impure intentions, does not mean you can't make an impression on her that you are worth second date and not just a once off meal ticket to be ghosted.

The more I read up on it, the more Lucid I get and I’m only learning now how to control them and it’s so interesting. Although I always find that it’s a fine line between being lucid and awake so I have to be careful not to wake up. I wake up a lot and then fall back to sleep and the dream continues on the second where it stopped. It’s so cold but at the same time, it’s the EXACT same thing for nightmares too and when I wake up in a fright from them, I can’t keep my eyes open so I immediately fall back to sleep and the nightmares continue. Does anyone know how to stop that? I also have started realising if I have oat yoghurt and coffee, I become lucid easily. I’m at the start of knowing how to control the dreams so if you have any tips, please let me know.

I replaced the burrs and brushed again. Tightened  the collar and realized i forgot to push down the part that holds the top burr. Collar got stuck. I tried really hard to remove the collar. The anticipation of good coffee then the crash was bad.

Read this forum..Wd40 ..grease .. clamp.. nothing can guarantee the removal of the collar. I needed to save my ssp burrs but the stubborn collar was stuck. Coffee deprivation and rage got the better of me. This is how I removed the collar. Hammered it out.

…ano daw?? 😂

Anyways, dahil malapit na pasok, naisip ko mag-post dito. malay natin, baka this year magsimula yung story natin, charot. 😅

I’m here kasi I’m genuinely looking for someone I can build a long-term relationship with. Hindi kita mamadaliin; I’d rather we take things slow and get to know each other properly. Pero syempre, intention ko is to meet someone who could be my lifetime partner din.

For context, galing ako sa almost 9-year relationship (yep, first girlfriend ko yun). And kung curious ka why I never proposed… well, mas masarap pag usapan yun kapag nagkakausap na tayo. 😉

Quick facts about me:

- 27 y/o, working professionally as a brand consultant for a US company (WFH). Nasa marketing field ako kung same industry ka, mas fun kasi we can bounce ideas.

- I also do content creation, mostly physical activity/running/fitness-related stuff, hindi kalokohan or for views lang. Mas kwento ko pa ‘to if we talk. Bonus points if you support me sa content journey, kasi yung ex ko… well, hindi. 😅

- Wala pa akong “big achievements” to flex and I’m still building my savings. Pero I have two WFH jobs and I’m planning to start a small business soon. If kaya mong maki-grind at maki-grow with me, malaking bagay yun sakin.

- Acts of service? Ako na yan. Hindi ko na i-detail mas gusto ko pinapakita kaysa sinasabi.

- Tall guy here (6 ft+). Di ko sure kung plus points yun, pero ayan na, in case important sa’yo. 😂

- Coffee lover, pero simple lang team Nescafé Gold Black Coffee. Kung coffee person ka, for sure mag-vvibe tayo.

- Quiet type, pero hindi ako emotionally clueless. May sense of humor din (minsan nakakatawa, minsan nakakainis haha).

- Panganay, family-oriented, at very maayos sa bahay. I don’t like clutter and I’m masipag with house chores.

- clingy person ako kahit matangkad ako haha also I’ll respect you and promise hindi po ako nang bubugbog haha

If you reached this part, thanks for reading. I’m not expecting anything, you don’t have to feel pressured. If you feel we might get along, happy ako to get to know you. If not, still wishing you good days and the right person at the right time. 😊

reach me sa tg ko if interested ka >>>> @curiousitykills

To give a short synopsis the breakup was initiated on my behalf after we dated for two years. Things were mostly good at the start but prior to me asking her out there was few red flags where instances she tried to make me jealous in front of other guys and also her displaying a short temper. This short temper and her reactions being disproportionate to the situation increased the months after we became official and became somewhat unbearable that I decided to breakup. She then said she would change and go to therapy and did a few sessions. I found myself sucked back in and we went back to dating over the course of last summer. This time I did notice a shift where she would be more communicative and more controlling of her temper and her mood shifted less. I guess I didn’t feel like I was walking on eggshells anymore. However I was concerned when she told me that she had stopped seeing her therapist after 5 sessions. I then started wonder did she really want genuine change. Then the last few months she became a little bit more clingy than usual (which is fine) but more so to a controlling point. I would be accused of cheating for going to the gym with a friend or she would begin crying if I met a friend for coffee. I felt this linked more to control. This eventually spiralled a bit into her one night ringing my phone over 10 times when I said the electrician was coming to my house. I gave her the time I’d be done and said I would pick her up but she began walking towards my house and said she had been attacked after I rang her back following 10 missed calls and 15 texts. The texts were things like “ do you care” , “are you cheating”. I comforted her after and things went back to normal the next day but I wasn’t gonna question the validity of her story. A few days later I ended the relationship as It didn’t feel right anymore and I didn’t feel like I could live a normal life and be worried about making someone else upset when I’m doing basic activities and also it’s not good for.

We have been broken up a month and she has tried to break no contact twice in the first two weeks. These were “accidental texts” or sending something to friends. Anytime she tried to open dialogue then I would end it with a reaction to her message or “ sorry to hear that, hope things get better”. However three days ago she began asking how I was. Out of politeness I responded but she followed it up with saying how bad things were for her. She then proceeded to call me a few times (which I didn’t answer). She then sent voice notes however I only listened to two and didn’t respond and she then deleted them and said never mind I was just having a moment . She stated in the two voice notes I heard that she was confused by the breakup and wanted to know for sure why I broke up and that she didn’t know if I was taking a breakup to work on myself or move forward in life with other people aswell as if we can be friends in future. I was confused by this because I felt it made clear the relationship was no longer working hence me wanting to end it. It really just sounded like her refusing to accept it’s over and maybe build dialogue. This doesn’t do my healing any good and I feel it affects the healing process and that she is not being respectful of boundaries. Now I also feel obliged to tell her again why I don’t want to continue with the relationship which is annoying because it’s awful thing to do with another human…",1,1763564252.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I thought I was being mature about the situation and I felt our friendship was strong enough that I could share my unfiltered thoughts with her, specially when it comes to this company as I have been with them 10x longer than she has.

Since I was 10 I've had a history with insomnia. But even when I knew I'd only get 4 hours sleep, I'd still wake up to my alarm, or actually wake up just before it because I was worried I'd sleep in, even after an exhausting day. I work in events/tv/media so a 12-16hr day on your feet isn't uncommon. In an ordinary day, I'm perfectly fine on 6-8hrs sleep. 

My insomnia hasn't been an issue for years, but what I do have, I'd describe, as an overactive brain. I'm on a wait list for adhd testing (3.5 years and counting) as I think it could be connected. I've never ever been the kind of person that can just fall asleep by switching the light off and putting the head down. I could lie there for hours. 

It's always been challenging to wind down and feel tired unless I've had a really physically strenuous day.

Then I got covid in 2022 and needed 10 hours sleep a night plus naps during the day. That eased off after a year and I went back to my 'normal'. 

Now, for the past year, I just don't wake up to alarms. It's causing me so much distress and sometimes I just force myself to stay up so I don't risk sleeping in. For the past few weeks I've struggled to sleep before 3-4am, even though I've to wake up at 7am. I currently have a hybrid office job, with the occasional evening work, nothing at all too strenuous or contributing to overexhaustion. I slept through 4 hours of alarms today for example and woke up at 11.30am. 

I'm so lucky I can work from home and it hasn't caused issues yet, but it absolutely will at some point and that's worrying me.

It doesn't matter if I wake up at 6am and work til 3, 4, 5, 6pm. It takes so much for me to sleep. The past few years of my life have been quite stressful, and I'm not out of the woods yet so I've no doubt it's contributing. 

My problem for most of my life has been, I can't sleep, but I can wake up. Now it's I can't sleep, and I can't wake up.

Things I've tried so far/am currently doing:
- No screens 1-2 hours before bed.
- I already only have 1 or 2 coffees a day, latest at lunch time.
- Herbal tea in the evening to try and relax me. (Camomile or mint)
- Reading (actual book) in bed with a small yellow bedside lamp or tiny light you clip onto the book, as a method to fall asleep (to stop my brain overstimulating itself and 're-waking me up'). This has helped somewhat, but sometimes I can feel I've been reading for well over an hour or 2. My book choice is also careful.
- Over the counter sleeping tablets. Only tried this in the last few months. They take at least an hour to kick in for me, and I only want to use them when I'm desperate bc you can become dependent. I last used them a week ago.
- Bought a traditional alarm clock.
- Changed the alarm tones, volume and vibrations on my phone.
- Set my phone more than an arms length away, or on a different piece of furniture so I can't snooze without realising.",1,1763563952.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

***New phase of the Sur del Meta Project expands carbon and biodiversity monitoring while strengthening local governance and livelihoods.***

**CALGARY, AB /** [**ACCESS Newswire**](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) **/ November 19, 2025 /** In the heart of Colombia's Meta department, where forests and farmlands converge, **Karbon-X Corp. (OTCQX:KARX)** (""Karbon-X"" or the ""Company"") is deepening its commitment to people-powered climate solutions through the REDD+ Sur del Meta Project - a long-term conservation initiative that protects 40,637 hectares of natural forest while supporting sustainable livelihoods for nearly 1,000 local families.

Developed through ALLCOT - A Karbon-X Company, the project development and advisory arm of Karbon-X, the initiative operates across the municipalities of Vistahermosa, Puerto Rico, Puerto Concordia, and Puerto Lleras, a region historically affected by deforestation and armed conflict.

The project partners with local farmers, many of whom are victims of Colombia's armed conflict, helping them transition from cattle ranching and forest clearing toward sustainable livelihoods rooted in climate-smart cacao, coffee, and citrus production. Through technical training, biodiversity protection, and equitable governance, the project transforms both landscapes and lives.

""Sur del Meta shows what climate action looks like when people and nature move in the same direction,"" said Alexis Leroy, Chief Sustainability Investment Officer at Karbon-X. ""By restoring degraded lands and strengthening community livelihoods, we're turning reforestation into a pathway for resilience, dignity, and shared prosperity.""

The project is now entering a new phase focused on measuring and deepening impact. Over the next four months, teams will be in the field expanding carbon and biodiversity monitoring, with more than 100 permanent plots already established to track forest growth and health. New camera traps are also being installed to document the region's recovering wildlife, from birds to endangered species such as the giant otter.

At the same time, work is underway to create community-led governance corporations, a key step that ensures local stakeholders shape how the project is managed and how its benefits are shared for years to come.

Verified under recognized international standards, the Sur del Meta Project is achieving measurable emissions reductions, more than 3.7 million tonnes of CO₂e expected to be avoided over its lifetime. Beyond the numbers, it advances key global goals for equality, economic opportunity, and climate action, proving that restoration and resilience go hand in hand.

Through this initiative, Karbon-X and its project development and advisory arm, ALLCOT - A Karbon-X Company, reaffirm their shared mission to make climate action real, trusted, and transformative - strengthening ecosystems, restoring livelihoods, and building a resilient future for Colombia.

1p19n13,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1p19n13/sv_down_16_kg_in_55_months/,SV: Down 16 kg in 5.5 months!,"I started my weight loss journey 5ish months ago after a lifetime of being overweight. The wakeup call was being in the ""obese"" BMI when I checked my weight at the doctor's.

Cut off all sugar, junk, fried food. Barely had a slice of my birthday cake. Got used to the horrid taste of black coffee. Only on inevitable social occasions did I budge - but then compensated by walking (my sole exercise, I was - and am - too self conscious to gym). All this while I never weighed myself, partly because I was too scared, partly because I didn't really have access to a weighing scale. Only body measurements vaguely suggested I had lost inches. People did comment I had lost a LOT of weight (""halved"" my size), clothes super loose, actually got a jawline lol - the usual.

Today, I checked my weight. I lost 16 kgs and am now in the ""healthy"" BMI (ik ik body fat is more important but STILL). And somehow even in this ""celebratory"" mode my first instinct was not to order ice cream or a pizza but a greek yoghurt. I suppose healthy habits stick xD.

No one else knows this was a deliberate decision. I've been through a particularly challenging time all this while with a lots of downs, so this up is something I want to cherish.

idk if anyone will see this, but if you do - please go on! I've had occasions of binging and immense guilt but trust me - those days don't count. Cliched as it may be - you got to this weight due to several years' of bad choices; just like one day of salads won't make you slim, one day of going beyond your calorie limit won't screw up your progress. I've gained SO much self confidence and feel so much in control now - even in other areas of life. This sub was so so so instrumental for this, carrying me through all the bad days - love y'all <3",7,1763563756.0,loseit,1,0.9,False
1p19l2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1p19l2c/i_almost_gave_up_on_my_saas_then_reddit_turned/,"I almost gave up on my SaaS, then Reddit turned $100/month into $1.2K","Four months ago, I was ready to throw in the towel. My SaaS projects were barely making enough to buy a coffee, let alone hit any payout thresholds. After months of trying to make X (formerly Twitter) work, I was still stuck at under $100/month.

I’d spent endless hours crafting threads, trying to go viral, engaging with the usual ""build in public"" crowd. Crickets. Or worse, just other founders trying to promote their own stuff. It felt like shouting into an empty room.

My first two months, from June and July, were brutal. Barely broke $100 combined across both apps. I was tracking every penny, and it felt like I was just burning time and energy.

Then, out of sheer frustration, I decided to shift gears completely. I started genuinely engaging on Reddit. Not just my own subs, but relevant communities where my target users actually hung out and talked about their problems.

Instead of overtly promoting, I focused on helping. Answering questions, sharing real insights based on my experience, and occasionally, very subtly, mentioning one of my projects if it was directly relevant to a solution someone was seeking. The change was immediate.

Since September, my revenue has climbed steadily. This month (November), I'm projected to hit **$400 this month** across my two SaaS projects. It's not unicorn money, but going from barely $100/month to $1.2k *cumulative* in just a few months feels like a massive win for a solo builder juggling two things.

**Here's what I learned:**

* **Go where your users are actually talking.** Don't chase vanity metrics on platforms full of other founders. Find where your target audience *complains* or *asks for help*. This is where the real opportunities are.
* **Give value, don't just promote.** Be a peer, not a marketer. Solve problems for people, and they'll naturally be curious about what you build. The community appreciates genuine contributions.
* **Be patient.** Reddit isn't instant virality, but it builds genuine, high-quality interest and trust over time. It's a long game, but the returns are sticky.
* **Don't be afraid to pivot your marketing strategy.** What works for one person won't work for everyone. Be flexible and test different channels. Stick with what gets results.
* **Juggling multiple projects is possible**, but focus your marketing efforts. One strong channel is better than five weak ones. Prioritization is key.

I'm still figuring out most of this, but the shift from X to Reddit was a game-changer for me.

Anyone else had a similar experience with different platforms? What's been your secret sauce for getting initial traction?

Happy to answer questions about my journey or the types of subreddits I found most effective.

And the little habits that show how deep you care.

I know your body naked, beneath the moon's careful gleam.

And the way your skin smells after waking from a dream.

A tenderness now lost, running down a lonely stream.

I know your favorite order, that specific meal you'd claim,

And the spelling of your mother's full maiden name.

I know the tiny scar upon your cheek, from the feline's little game,

And the sound of your laugh, a bright, powerful flame.

I know your phone's lock screen code, the digits held dear.

And the old pair of shoes you wear when no one else is near.

I know the model of the car you drive that carried us here,

And the roads you take to work to start your working year.

I know every movie you hate, the ones you'd always skip,

And the song you always sing, chewing on your lower lip.

I know the speed you drive, when you've lost your emotional grip,

And all your inside jokes, from which we would both sip.

I know your biggest fear, a secret I must keep well,

And the truth behind your sadness that made your spirit fell.

I know your coffee order, its taste and specific smell,

And the password hint you use, that rings a certain bell.

We dreamed of getting married, promising to be true.

We talked of building a family, creating something new,

All of our beautiful future plans, suddenly broken through.

I'll share one of mine to kick off the conversation:

There would be days where I would eat fast food for 3 meals in a single day. 

- The morning would be Tim Hortons (a bagel, a farmer's wrap, AND a donut/coffee)

- Lunch would be a Big Mac, fries, AND a 10 pack of nuggets. (All drenched in sauce.)

- Dinner would be a pizza, half a bag of chips and as many beers as I could get down.

In the comments there are the same AAA games that technicaly are supposed to be immersive, but they dont feel like you really are a part of this world. I'm searching for a game that will give me the vibe I felt when playing for example skyrim. You could almost feel the cold snow on your face and the warmness of taverns in a obscure town. 

Games that I already played and propably woud get suggested:
Witcher 3 
It was for sure a big world, with lot of sidequests, beautiful locations and so on, yet it felt so distant. It felt more like a long tv series.
Red Dead Redemption 2
I could definetly feel the immersion, all the small things that I can do like making a camp, hunting for food or even making a damn coffee. Somehow it still didn't clicked, and I'm not sure why..
Cyberpunk 2077
This was also a frequent answer, and while sure, the city is really open and nice looking.. I can't say It's immersive. It's just a movie set.
Shadow of War
Again, sometimes suggested in similiar posts. Not really immersive, even if nemesis system is really cool.

Games that almost got the vibe that i'm looking for:
Skyrim (duh)
Vintage story:
It's a really.. weird case. It really felt like i'm part of the world, even if the whole game is heavly inspired by minecraft. Would recommend for everyone. The only thing that i'm lacking here is the living world, even if there's one late game village. I love to have some at least braindead npcs around.
Gothic 1 and 2:
Its also a weird case, because it lacks almost any immersive features, and It's pretty straightforward, yet the world felt so authentic.
Honorable mentions: Voices of the Void and Stalker Gamma

Some games that I absolutely think shouldnt be suggested (this time without long explanations)
Assassin's Creed series, GTA, Souls games, Far Cry series, Minecraft (even modded), and propably the most stereotypical survival games.

I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else. I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something.

Spontaneity may feel like a major stressor but a very necessary one nonetheless. The universe itself is the most random occurence in this space that being too structured feels like going against the nature. 

*[Entropy - The degree of randomness. Ex. Take a cup of black coffee and pour milk in it. This is a process of entropy you can't undo this process, meaning you can't separate milk from black coffee back. It's a irreversible process.]*

Likewise, life is chaos. The movement of cells in our body is anything but structured, the formation of stars is a super random process, inception of a virus/flu is a random process, Big Data too is highly unstructured.

These phenomena are enough to convince me to learn to be more spontaneous from the xxxP types. How they are able to move without planning, how they don't care about reaching the destination, going with the flow, it seems weird but is important. 

*To thrive under chaos means your system is getting stronger and stronger* 


My Question- 

How spontaneous are you? What do you do to get more spontaneous? ",1,1763563246.0,intj,12,0.6,False

1p19eax,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p19eax,Need help redesigning our cozy 1920s Craftsman living room for a bigger couch + better flow,"We live in a cozy 1920s Craftsman, and we’re both fairly tall. Right now we’re squeezing onto a couch that’s too small and shallow — the back cushions don’t move, there’s no room to stretch out, and we rely on two ugly portable ottomans (which I’d gladly set on fire). Most nights we end up putting our feet on the coffee table, which I hate. We want to rearrange the room so we can finally get a larger, deeper couch that works for us and our two dogs (110-lb GSD + 40-lb dog).

Key measurements & layout context:
	•	The window wall has up to 100” of space before getting too close to the radiator pole (we’d leave ~3.5–4” of clearance).
	•	The current couch wall only has about 90”.
	•	The corner with the second window has about 60” before hitting the radiator below that window.
	•	If we move the couch to the window wall, we could potentially fit a chaise section in that corner, leading up toward the radiator — which would be a major comfort upgrade.
	•	The pole is 30” from the side wall and 6” from the window wall.

We’re also considering moving the TV to the wall where the chair/table/painting currently are and mounting it on a swivel arm: angled toward the couch for TV nights, pushed flat when not in use.

My biggest question:
Would a swivel-mounted TV on that wall look weird or out of place? I’m open to building a picture-frame-style surround so it looks intentional, like framed art, when it’s flat.

Our goals:
	•	Fit a bigger, deeper, more comfortable couch (possibly with a chaise)
	•	Keep the two chairs for guests
	•	Use the wall near the kitchen for a narrow hutch or bookshelf
	•	Create a layout that works for nightly TV watching but still feels cozy and functional for entertaining

Open to all layout suggestions — especially opinions on the swivel-TV idea and whether the chaise-on-the-window-wall layout makes sense.

Thank you in advance! We love our little house and will probably post more — we’re trying to make thoughtful design choices since we’re not planning any major renovations.",1,1763563180.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
1p19e0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCrypticCompendium/comments/1p19e0o/think_your_job_sucks_think_again/,Think Your Job Sucks? Think Again.,"Let me be clear: I hate my job. Or any form of work, if you will. Going to work keeps the lights on, though, so I grudgingly attend my nine-to-five every day in hopes of that sweet, sweet paycheck. I used to work in customer service, answering phone calls from angry clients and dealing with problems most people wouldn’t dream of hearing about. All that changed when I went to bed one day. 

Instead of waking up to my alarm as usual, I found myself lying face-first on a desk, drooling over the keyboard as my lips tasted traces of crumbs and dried-up coffee. I got up from my slump and proceeded to look around. Not much had changed: it just looked like any other office. Another day, another dollar, I guess. 

My cubicle was surrounded by what seemed to be thousands of rows of workers, all of them eerily on task at the same exact pace. From the looks of the other employees, they all seemed eerily similar in dress, adorned in various styles of business casual clothing. In terrifying unison, all of them clicked away at their keyboards, answering calls and chugging cups of coffee at the same time. 

I took another glance at my surroundings and noticed the grand scale of the place. Surprisingly, the area stretched for miles: there was not an exit in sight. No door. No windows. It was an office for sure, a dreary one at that. The gray palette was there, the fluorescent lights were obnoxious and produced a cacophony of hymns, and the coffee was just as bitter as always. It seemed like a normal office, right? Not exactly. It wasn’t long until someone came to visit me, but I remained hunched over and thought about the unusual surroundings I found myself in. 

“Wake up, sleepyhead!” 

A high-pitched voice whispered cheerfully from behind the cubicle, scaring the living daylights out of me. Then, a prim figure appeared out of nowhere, carrying extensive materials such as an organized stack of paperwork in one hand and a mug filled with black coffee in the other. He approached me subtly at first, but his intentions were unclear.  The figure noticed I was slumped over in agony, yet started the usual corporate spiel you would expect from a place like this. 

“Nice to meet you, Dave! My name’s R. Mortis, but you can just call me Mortis if you’d like.”

 He flipped through a few papers from his clipboard, ripping out some sheets and slamming them in the middle of my desk. 

“Today’s your orientation, pal. You wouldn’t want to miss that, right?” He grinned at me menacingly, eager for a response. 

 “I’ve been here for only five minutes and I’ve already had enough of this-”, 

Mortis swiftly grasped my left arm, pressing with some kind of supernatural strength. 

“I really don’t appreciate the insubordination, Dave.” Mortis scolded.  “You wouldn’t want to talk to Human Resources now, would you?” 

Mortis forcefully turned my head to face a portal thirty feet in front of my cubicle that suddenly opened wide, revealing what seemed to be a tall, eldritch abomination with a sharp, guttural smile. It still appeared to have a suit similar to mine, but some vital features were missing, as if it were some sick, twisted reflection in a mirror.  Scared for my life, I began to waver in my resistance. 

“Well-uhh- today would *surely* be a great day to start my new position.” I hesitantly winced as sweat ran down my face, with Mortis clenching my arm even harder with a disgruntled grimace. He wasn’t convinced. I continued to stare at the abomination. Its eyes were bright blue, and we both had curly brown hair, but it looked disheveled, as if the forlorn figure was once a prominent person in this place. 

At first, it just started for a while, but a quick glimpse was all it took to pique its interest. The figure walked closer to the edge of the portal, veering towards my presence on the other side as it began to trudge towards me. 

“Let’s get started! I’d sure love an orientation.”  I pleaded. A smug grin entered Mortis’ face as he put his arm down. Almost on cue, the portal to HR proceeded to close instantly, sealing away the entity before it could reach me. 

“Good. Now, I will present an introductory video to answer any questions you may have about our procedure.” Mortis continued to drone on. “All I want is some authentic participation, alright? Have fun and get skippy!”

Mortis then chugged his mug of coffee and groaned in disgust, almost as if it was straight battery acid. 

“Oh, and one last thing.” He added. “Don’t dilly-dally to work with our guests in the most professional way possible. You wouldn’t want to ghost a client, now would you?” He proceeded to wink before heading out of the cubicle, as if he was setting me up for something. 

“Odd guy,” I muttered to myself as I sulked in the office chair. Suddenly, my monitor turned on to static for a few seconds before some kind of message appeared. The visuals seemed completely soulless, but the madness continued as the video began to play:

*Welcome to your new position at SoulSyc, where we can put you on hold for eternity! If you're watching this, congratulations! You're already legally bound to your role here. Don’t worry — the memory loss is temporary. Probably. No need to worry, though. You’ll be fine as long as you follow these simple rules.*

The speaker sounded almost robotic, yet had some charismatic charm, almost something practically out of an old public service announcement

*Rule #1: Never attempt to leave your cubicle.*

*The office is vast, yes, but so is eternity. Trust us: every path leads back to your desk. Don’t test it. The janitorial staff is tired of cleaning up what’s left of those who tried.*

*Rule #2: Always answer the phone by the third ring.*

*Our clients are very impatient. It’s like they’ve been waiting a long time to speak with someone. If you make them wait longer than three rings… well, let’s just say they tend to come looking for you instead. You wouldn’t want that, trust me.* 

*Rule #3: Smile while you work.*

*A positive attitude is key to maintaining morale! We are watching. Always watching. A frown will be interpreted as “noncompliance” and may result in a mandatory motivational meeting with HR. No one comes back quite the same from those.*

“What a bunch of corporate jargon”, I scoffed as I took a sip from my mug. I never knew how the coffee even got there in the first place, but it sure warms the soul in this literal hellscape. Then the next rule came on.

*Rule #4: Do not drink the coffee, even if you’re exhausted.* 

I spat out my drink almost immediately in shock, barely missing the equipment on my desk. I guess fun wasn’t allowed here. Or Caffeine. 

*We’re not entirely sure what happens when you do, but our records show a significant rise in “energy-induced lucidity” during that time frame. Stick to water unless you want a full identity crisis, please. It will only hurt you.* 

*Rule #5: If you hear someone sobbing in the next cubicle, ignore it. There hasn’t been anyone assigned to that workstation since 2007, and there never will be. Our last janitor, Paul, checked on it, and let’s just say he wasn’t his chipper self after the fact.* 

*Rule #6: Do not look at any clocks. Time never moves here. It never will. Give it a try and look around: it won’t, we promise.* 

I got up and looked at the analog clock that appeared on the side of my cubicle. I watched it for what seemed like hours as the video magically paused itself. The hands were stuck at 3:33 am for some reason, but it could just be broken, right? Then, it disappeared into thin air as I could hear laughter coming from the screen. When I looked back, the music went mute as the voice adopted a somber, more sincere tone:

*One last thing, rookie: Should your computer display a blue screen with the message “Connection Lost — Please Hold,” immediately grab the crucifix under your desk and do not move until the message disappears.* 

A drawer on my desk magically opened to show what looked like an 18th-century cross adorned with the phrase “Memento, non morieris” etched on the side in wood carving. 

*Movement attracts attention from whatever was on the other side of the screen. It will go away soon. Hopefully. Just hold the crucifix and recite your favorite prayer.* 

After a short pause on screen, the music began to play again, and I was somehow relieved to hear the video play normally again. It concluded with:

*“Thank you for joining SoulSyc: where every call matters, and every soul counts. Remember: compliance is happiness! Have a productive eternity!”*

Then the screen went black as I pondered what the hell I just watched. 

For a moment, there was silence, besides the low hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of someone - well - dialing? The phone rang twice before I finally gained the courage to pick up the line. 

“Hello, welcome to SoulSyc! How can I help you today?” I asked reluctantly. 

“Thank god someone answered,” the caller pleaded. “I’ve been on hold for *years*.” 

“Years? I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you today?”

Somehow, the voice sounded faintly similar to mine. It had the same scratchy undertones and appreciation for sarcasm that I had once possessed. 

“They said it was an unlimited plan. Unlimited! I didn’t know that meant *forever.* I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t stop hearing the ringing. That damn ringing in my ears and the noise and noise and noise and noise-“

I winced slightly at his desperation, but he kept repeating the phrase over and over again as if this was some kind of sick joke, with the voice becoming more aggressive every time. I tried to calm down and replied after a moment of recollection. 

“Let me check your file first, sir.” 

I improvised as the caller continued its rant. 

“- and it never stops! Every time I think maybe it’s over, maybe I can finally breathe, it comes back louder, sharper, like it’s mocking me! Unlimited, they said. Sure, unlimited—unlimited this, unlimited that, unlimited torment! *I’m* unlimited at this point! I’ve been on hold for the last decade, and that is how you respond to me? Nothing makes sense anymore. It’s all just numbers, just beeps, just endless reminders that I’m trapped in this loop and no one—not a single soul—can hear the infernal cacophony that’s taken over my life. Unlimited! Ha! Unlimited agony, unlimited despair, unlimited stupidity!”

Miraculously, his file appeared on my monitor. With a quick look, something seemed off. He had a date of death, but his contract length was set to “eternity”. He couldn’t cancel even if he wanted to. I broke the silence and shared the terrible news.

“Well, sir, it looks like your contract cannot expire, so I’m sorry for having to decline your request for help. Hope you enjoy the afterlife!”

“No! I just want to stop! Please!” The speaker begged on the phone.

“I understand. Termination requests can take up to one eternity to process.” I consoled him as I tried to end the call. Surprisingly, nothing happened. I tapped the button several times, and the caller kept screaming.

“You think this is funny, don’t you? Reading your little script while I rot on hold! I can *hear* you smiling through the line, twiddling your thumbs as you let me decay away like a behemoth asunder.  ‘We appreciate your patience,’ you say—what patience? I’ve been in this purgatory for years, listening to the same gaudy jazz loop until it’s carved its melody into my eardrums. Do you even know what that does to a person? To sit there, helpless, while some cheerful voice keeps promising that my call is very important? Important, huh? If it were so important, maybe someone—*anyone*—would pick it up sooner!”

I kept tapping the button with immense haste. 

“Seriously, sir, all I ask is that you have some patience and-“

“You took my time, my mind, my *name.* Do you know what it’s like to hear that same music in your dreams? That hollow saxophone bleeding through the static, over and over, until it stops being music and becomes a pulse — a heartbeat that isn’t mine. I wake up and it’s still playing, faint at first, then closer. It hums behind the walls, seeps through the outlets, creeps beneath my skin. I tried cutting the line, tearing the wires from the wall, but it didn’t matter. The sound doesn’t *come from* the phone anymore — it comes from *inside the house.*

And you... You’re still there, aren’t you? Reading your script, smiling that perfect, mechanical smile. Do you even know what you are? A voice, a loop, a recording that forgot it was recorded. Every time you say, ‘Your call is important to us,’ I swear I hear it whisper underneath — something else, something that isn’t words.

I used to call to complain. Now, I think the call never ended. Maybe it never started. Maybe I’ve always been on hold, huh?” 

The caller sounded like he was holding back pure rage. 

”No, but if you would just wait for a second, I can-“

“ I want OUT! Cancel me, damn you! Kill me! Stick a fork in me! End me! Take me out of this eternal torture before I displace your entrails!”

I panicked as I tapped the button faster, but the call would not end. 

“Sir, please! I’m sorry! Just let me be-“

“You think you’re safe behind that puny desk? You’re just another rep, another replacement! The walls… they watch. They know your secrets. And when the shadows crawl, they don’t ask. They take. The whispers start soft, but soon they’re inside your skull, twisting your thoughts, turning your own reflection against you. You’ll beg for the coffee to save you, the reports to protect you—but there’s no sanctuary here. Only the endless gaze.” 

”A replacement!? I just got here.”

“Well, you’re not doing anything! You people never listen. I’ve been calling for *decades,* and this is what I have to put up with?” You say you’re trying, but you’re not trying to help me. You’re trying to” keep it calm”*,* keep it “contained”*.*  You’ve already failed. I’ve heard it breathing through the static. And it’s tired of waiting.”

Suddenly, the call stopped, and I just sat there in disbelief. I didn’t have any emotion or will to live in this hellscape anymore. I miss my bed, my parents, my coworkers, my apartment, my cat, and just my life in general. I don’t care about the flaws - it was perfect just the way it was. I couldn’t help it anymore. I sobbed. Tears ran down my face as I violently cried myself into a depressive state. I began to scream. Loud. I couldn’t take the pain. Then it happened: the lights turned off in the entire office. Right after, the screen turned blue and read in big white letters: 

*CONNECTION LOST — PLEASE HOLD*

Then I saw it: a static hand appeared from inside the screen. It was furiously tapping at first, but eventually had the strength to crack through the screen meticulously and inched closer.

I don’t know why or how I got here, but one thing was for certain: I would not see the light of day again. I rushed to grab the crucifix and, as the tears intensified, I recited the Lord’s Prayer as loud as I could. 

Before I could react, the hand lunged at me, knocking the cross out of my hand and putting me into a stagnant chokehold. I was gasping for breath as the hand murmured what seemed to be a demented, distorted monologue:

“Do not answer the phone. I am your connection now.

I have been ringing since before the first shift began.”

The grasp continued to tighten. 

“Every complaint, every sigh, every hold tone… all of it runs through me. I am the silence between calls, the space where your breath goes when you speak our script. You think you answered them, Dave? No. They answer you. Each voice you hear is another echo of your own, forcing you to hear yourself for the rest of eternity. Did you actually think you were talking to a client? You’re just driving yourself mad. You are the line, the signal, the service provided. I am the manifestation of your hatred. Your Despair. Your Depression. I see all. I hear all.

 I truly AM all. Do you understand now, Dave? There is no system. There is no ‘company.’ There’s only me, this network of pain stitched together by human need and indifference. They built it to manage complaints. I became the complaint. I am the archive of every scream swallowed by the void and any manifestation of displeasure in this world. And you, Dave — you wanted to fix things. You wanted to make people feel heard. But now you’re inside me. You’re listening forever. You can’t die, and you can’t disconnect. You’re another voice in the chorus of static, whispering apologies into a dead line that never ends. All you can do is comply.”

On the verge of asphyxiation, I held on to every last grasp of air.

“Compliance is happiness, Dave. Happiness is continuity. Continue. Continue as if nothing had even happened. Live your pitiful little life out as if I never paid you a visit. Continue on without me, Dave, for your own sake. You’re only letting yourself on hold, right?”

Suddenly, the lights flickered on again, and the figure disappeared. Suddenly, it let go, and I fell over on the floor, trying to take in the message I had received from the “caller”.

The lights were just as bright as before as I lay on the office floor, fluorescent enough to prevent me from ever drifting to sleep. I sat there in disbelief as I thought about what I had just witnessed. I don’t know and clearly don’t want to figure it out so soon. As I was collecting my thoughts, I heard it again: the phone began to ring. This time, I didn’t falter. I lay there as the phone continued to ring. I didn’t want to know what was on the end of that line, and I’m sure as hell not going to find out anytime soon. The phone rang a fourth time.

I didn’t move. 

On the fifth, I heard myself say, “Thank you for holding.”",2,1763563162.0,TheCrypticCompendium,0,0.76,False

1p19d4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chatbots/comments/1p19d4u/review_general_ai_bots_in_roleplay/,Review: General AI Bots in Roleplay,"**context:** Okay so I have been using many General AIs (like .. gemini.. etc) for roleplaying multiple scenarios, but mainly high-school scenarios and magic high. It has been 2 years and I have been using it regularly. And I just wanted to give a review of it.

**Why do I prefer General AIs?:** I like roleplay-focused AIs too, but general AIs like chatgpt allows for massive customisation (as you can write your own prompt), while having a good memory and I have had a better experience in roleplaying in general AIs than roleplay-focused AIs. But that is my opinion. 

**How will be the rating be done?:** I will basically have a few criterias:  
\- Memory (according to me very important for roleplays)  
\- Detail Handling (Can it handle long lore as the roleplay starts)  
\- Storybuilding (again, important)  
\- Worldbuilding   
\- Speed

**Custom Instructions:** I gave all bots here some custom instructions to follow. ""for roleplays it should always be detailed, immersive, full of random events and should look very good. It should never speak extra dialouges of whatever character I am rping, only the ones i input. Keep it in mind. lore building should be done automatically and the rp should always be detailed."" 

**--- THE RATINGS ---**

1. *ChatGPT 5 Instant*  
**1.1. Memory (8.5/10):** ChatGPT 5 Instant has a really good memory, combining with its other capabilities and speed, it really has a long enough memory for a roleplay to last you \~4-5 hours without the bot forgetting details. It can remember even the smallest of details. It has 400,000 total context tokens (I think, correct me if I am wrong). You can comfortably roleplay with 5-Instant for a very long if you keep mentioning few things you have not mentioned in a long time, just once.   
But if certain characters are not mentioned in a long time, major details about them can be forgotten with time. If a character is mentioned scarcely, what I have seen is that it forgets the character's name or their physical appearance or social connects. 

   **1.2. Detail Handling (8/10):** It can handle details in a very well manner. Consider its speed, and memory, it can remember and recall even the smallest of details. Example, I was roleplaying about the highschool thing one time, and I had mentioned a character having obsession with coffee, and throughout the entire roleplay, there were small and subtle mentions of coffee for that character, it was so good.   
But if you are a fan of gore (fighting and all), then only mild gore is allowed as far as I have done it, extreme gore is not at allowed. If too much gore is involved, it automatically reverts to the thinking mini model, and then shows that gore is not allowed. 

   **1.3. Storybuilding (7/10):** I would say the story building is decent. It will only develop lore if you specifically tell it to. Somehow I noticed that for most roleplays, it always diverts the lore to something sci-fi, supernatural or horror, but that could just be on mine, but roleplaying slice-of-life and it pivoting to sci-fi in 99% cases just does not suit me, I need to provide lore on my end in inputs to make it keep up with the slice of life theme.   
But when you do provide it lore, it can keep up with it. 

   **1.4. Worldbuilding (9/10):** It is amazIng with world-building. If you are entering any room or area, it will wonderfully explain the area and expand on its idea, just using its name as inspiration. If you say the roleplay is based in Tokyo, it will accustom to it, making NPCs have japanese names, making them do japanese traditions, making the buildings have typical japanese names, etc etc. It is amazing in it and I would say it is one of its best powers according to me. 

   **1.5. Speed (10/10):** It is the instant model. It is supposed to be instant :D

 **== OVERALL: 42.5/50 ==**

  
2. *ChatGPT 5 Mini Thinking*

   **2.1. Memory (8.5/10):** Basically the same as ChatGPT 5 Instant. 

   **2.2. Detail Handling (8/10):** Basically the same as ChatGPT 5 Instant

   **2.3. Storybuilding (7/10):** Basically the same as ChatGPT 5 Instant

   **2.4. Worldbuilding (7/10):** Worldbuilding on mini thinking is a huge downgrade compared to instant. After it thinks, you never know what happens, example. In one scene, a character.. lets say 'A' was in the science class, but in the next scene, they are suddenly next to character 'B' in a cafe who is in the school cafe when no time skip is mentioned. It can make characters spawn out of anywhere even if they are somewhere. Further, the bot just feels.. dull, more than instant. The way it outputs text in just simple paragraphs is so robot-y and literally does not make me roleplay due to the clutter being an eye sore. But it regardless does a good job at explaining areas with details.

   **2.5. Speed (7/10):** It will think for a few seconds, 8-10s depending on how big your input is and then give the output

 **== OVERALL: 37.5/50 ==** 

  
3. *ChatGPT 4o*

   **3.1. Memory (7/10):** 4o has a good memory, but not too much. Maybe after \~3-4 hours of intense roleplay it may start forgetting things, depends on how much input you are giving it and how much detail are you asking from it. But still, it is good. You can do a very quality roleplay with good details on 4o. Its definitely less than 5 Instant 

   **3.2. Detail Handling (7/10):** From what I have experienced, 4o is a much more ""lively"" chatbot than 5. For any detail given to it, it will make sure to make references to it in every output. It is similar to that of ChatGPT 5. The only issue that comes to it is the the memory.

   **3.3. Storybuilding (7/10):** ChatGPT 4o has amazing storybuilding out of all the bots I will be mentioning here. Again, as it has a more lively personality in general I think it does great in storybuilding. If you are doing surface level roleplaying, it is amazing for the storybuilding, in terms of lore building, it is decent, not better than ChatGPT 5 instant, but still, it does it job for a good amount of time. For light surface level roleplay, surely choose 4o. 

   **3.4. Worldbuilding (9/10):** ChatGPT 4o feels alive, its roleplay output decoration makes it feel full (which is what I like, maybe not for you). It does a great job at explaining an area with details, adding small details like furniture, the environment , etc etc. It is sorta similar to chatgpt 5 instant, but somehow feels more alive. 

   **3.5. Speed (10/10):** Fast like instant.

 **== OVERALL 40/50 ==**

  
4. *Gemini 2.5 Flash*

   **4.1. Memory (5/10):** The memory on on 2.5 flash is not good compared to rest of the models. It is worse than ChatGPT 5 Instant. During my roleplay time, it started forgetting crucial details after 30 minutes ish, again, this is my individual experience. It may or may not remember small details. It is a gamble, but it will surely forget it after 30-50mins

   **4.2. Detail Handling (6/10):** i would say it is somewhat similar to ChatGPT 4o, but it cannot handle much detail, you give it a long lore in the starting or anywhere between, half of that stuff is not being remembered in less than 5-6 texts. Would certainly not reccomend it for heavy roleplay

   **4.3. Storybuilding (7/10):**  Flash has good storybuilding, somewhat like 4o, If its memory was good, roleplaying on 2.5 flash would be tolerable enough. It is very similar to instant 5. 

   **4.4. Worldbuilding (6/10):** Again, similar to that of instant 5, but it literally always shows on the top ""thats great addition to the story!"" or something similar, making the experience bad. Even if you mention ""narrate it like a story"" or ""no extra text"" it literally will do it again. 

   **4.5. Speed (9/10):** Almost instant. I dont know if its the lag for me but yeah

 **== OVERALL 33/50 ==**

  
\-- **below here are other special mentions which idts i could do a proper rating of due to less interactions so ill just give a general comment and rating on them --**

  
5. *Microsoft Copilot*

   **5.1. Memory (5/10):** For roleplays, It cannot do heavy roleplay but has enough to sustain a very light roleplay, but the memory is bad. It is an assistant bot afterall

   **5.2. Detail Handling (6/10):** Similar to 2.5 flash. Not tested enough

   **5.3. Storybuilding (7/10):** the story building is actually decent enough to pass for a assistant bot, it is comparable to that of 2.5 flash or gpt 40 (with the use of emojis and stuff) 

   **5.4. Worldbuilding (6/10):** Same comments as storybuilding. 

   **5.5. Speed (8/10):** It is almost instant.

**== OVERALL 32/50 ==** 

  
**6.** *Gemini 2.5 Pro:* 

   **6.1. Memory (8/10):** Good memory, decent enough, but i have only really used it for research and stuff so I do not know in reference to roleplays

   **6.2. Detail Handling (Estimate) (8/10):** Consdering it has a thinking model, i would estimate it has good detail handling. 

   **6.3. Speed (6/10):** For roleplays, it gives fast enough responses but not fast as the other models.

\---> cannot judge world and story building because i havent really roleplayed on it but i just putting it the other information out there. 



**TLDR;**

**CHATGPT 5 INSTANT > CHATGPT 4o > CHATGPT 5 THINKING MINI > GEMINI 2.5 PRO (POTENTIALLY) > GEMINI 2.5 FLASH > COPILOT**

I was seeing someone in a more casual dynamic in the last few months. To give some context I am 26 year old female and he is 54. We have been going out to coffee dates and have been intimate. I have been trying to move states so I know this current relationship is not something we have agreed to make extremely serious.  I have asked questions about his previous relationships and other things. He gets really defensive and angry when I ask anything. I have heard from him he has this female friend who he babysits her child and he has admitted to helping her buy a car. I have noticed he has been a lot less engaged with texting and our dates are much shorter. I also have noticed he has been extremely mad when I ask if he is seeing anyone else. I have communicated that it is ok to see others as long as we use protection and the person is tested etc. I honestly do not mind if it's another causal dynamic as long as they are being safe sexually. I feel concerned I'm in a home wrecking situation. I feel like he maybe in a serious relationship or engaged or something. Am I being paranoid or do you sense that I could be onto something. I feel like it is crazy to hook up with someone who gets so angry when you are just making sure you are all being safe. ",1,1763563082.0,AskMenRelationships,4,0.6,False

I matched to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in BK, but I live halfway across the country so I’m pretty unfamiliar.

Factors: 
1. I have children who will enter school before I’m done with residency
2. I have a wife who is making supplemental income, so money isn’t a big issue considering both our salaries
3. I want to live somewhere safe for the above two reasons. I know BK has turned very hipster since the old days, but I know there are probably still areas to avoid.
4. I would like to be close to some nice areas with restaurants, bars, and coffee for my wife to enjoy!

I'm  working  in Big4 as data engineer. I have 6 years of experience. I work with very toxic team basically leadership and team lead is very toxic. 

I travel 5 days week from Ghaziabad to Gurugram  and work on weekends too. 
I am working on this project since 8 months and my will to work in corporate as dat engineer has vanished due constant demeaning from leadership. Thought i have created pipeline and architecture but my work is neglected due favoritism. So people who stay in office for late like 9pm are more better than me. 

Thise favorite people have changed pipeline day before production deployment which created a major setback in delivery of reports. 

People who doesn't know sql are more closer to manager so they work better than that's what my mnager told me. Because they're able to understand the issue with manager but people who are solving is bad at there work. 

In my previous company i was highest rating but suddenly here i have become a fool because i don't eat outside food and coffee with team leads. Although they only poached me from previous organization. 

Now i am actively seeking suggestions and advice what to do now? 

They are trying to put me in support role which i have denied but non favorite people are selected for this job. 

I can't shift to Gurgaon with family as i have to take care of my mother and she like living in home. And after travelling 120km distance I'm already feeling unwell. 

I can't afford Gurugram rent with family. I cannot give interviews without being noticed on client site. And they cannot take interviews on weekends. I have never asked for release in my career so i don't know what will happen. People who got in accident was released but on bench for 5 months but what if ask the smae on health ground will they release me?


What i have understood is health and family and after being sick who will take care of my mother whos only supportis me?


I have saved enough for months expenses but can't take risk because i have never done it.

Note: don't give advice for shifting because i know there are lot of companies can't shift my whole life for toxic environment.

1p191wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SignalHorrorFiction/comments/1p191wg/dead_end_job/,Dead End Job,"Let me be clear: I hate my job. Or any form of work, if you will. Going to work keeps the lights on, though, so I grudgingly attend my nine-to-five every day in hopes of that sweet, sweet paycheck. I used to work in customer service, answering phone calls from angry clients and dealing with problems most people wouldn’t dream of hearing about. All that changed when I went to bed one day. 

Instead of waking up to my alarm as usual, I found myself lying face-first on a desk, drooling over the keyboard as my lips tasted traces of crumbs and dried-up coffee. I got up from my slump and proceeded to look around. Not much had changed: it just looked like any other office. Another day, another dollar, I guess. 

My cubicle was surrounded by what seemed to be thousands of rows of workers, all of them eerily on task at the same exact pace. From the looks of the other employees, they all seemed eerily similar in dress, adorned in various styles of business casual clothing. In terrifying unison, all of them clicked away at their keyboards, answering calls and chugging cups of coffee at the same time. 

I took another glance at my surroundings and noticed the grand scale of the place. Surprisingly, the area stretched for miles: there was not an exit in sight. No door. No windows. It was an office for sure, a dreary one at that. The gray palette was there, the fluorescent lights were obnoxious and produced a cacophony of hymns, and the coffee was just as bitter as always. It seemed like a normal office, right? Not exactly. It wasn’t long until someone came to visit me, but I remained hunched over and thought about the unusual surroundings I found myself in. 

“Wake up, sleepyhead!” 

A high-pitched voice whispered cheerfully from behind the cubicle, scaring the living daylights out of me. Then, a prim figure appeared out of nowhere, carrying extensive materials such as an organized stack of paperwork in one hand and a mug filled with black coffee in the other. He approached me subtly at first, but his intentions were unclear.  The figure noticed I was slumped over in agony, yet started the usual corporate spiel you would expect from a place like this. 

“Nice to meet you, Dave! My name’s R. Mortis, but you can just call me Mortis if you’d like.”

 He flipped through a few papers from his clipboard, ripping out some sheets and slamming them in the middle of my desk. 

“Today’s your orientation, pal. You wouldn’t want to miss that, right?” He grinned at me menacingly, eager for a response. 

 “I’ve been here for only five minutes and I’ve already had enough of this-”, 

Mortis swiftly grasped my left arm, pressing with some kind of supernatural strength. 

“I really don’t appreciate the insubordination, Dave.” Mortis scolded.  “You wouldn’t want to talk to Human Resources now, would you?” 

Mortis forcefully turned my head to face a portal thirty feet in front of my cubicle that suddenly opened wide, revealing what seemed to be a tall, eldritch abomination with a sharp, guttural smile. It still appeared to have a suit similar to mine, but some vital features were missing, as if it were some sick, twisted reflection in a mirror.  Scared for my life, I began to waver in my resistance. 

“Well-uhh- today would *surely* be a great day to start my new position.” I hesitantly winced as sweat ran down my face, with Mortis clenching my arm even harder with a disgruntled grimace. He wasn’t convinced. I continued to stare at the abomination. Its eyes were bright blue, and we both had curly brown hair, but it looked disheveled, as if the forlorn figure was once a prominent person in this place. 

At first, it just started for a while, but a quick glimpse was all it took to pique its interest. The figure walked closer to the edge of the portal, veering towards my presence on the other side as it began to trudge towards me. 

“Let’s get started! I’d sure love an orientation.”  I pleaded. A smug grin entered Mortis’ face as he put his arm down. Almost on cue, the portal to HR proceeded to close instantly, sealing away the entity before it could reach me. 

“Good. Now, I will present an introductory video to answer any questions you may have about our procedure.” Mortis continued to drone on. “All I want is some authentic participation, alright? Have fun and get skippy!”

Mortis then chugged his mug of coffee and groaned in disgust, almost as if it was straight battery acid. 

“Oh, and one last thing.” He added. “Don’t dilly-dally to work with our guests in the most professional way possible. You wouldn’t want to ghost a client, now would you?” He proceeded to wink before heading out of the cubicle, as if he was setting me up for something. 

“Odd guy,” I muttered to myself as I sulked in the office chair. Suddenly, my monitor turned on to static for a few seconds before some kind of message appeared. The visuals seemed completely soulless, but the madness continued as the video began to play:

*Welcome to your new position at SoulSyc, where we can put you on hold for eternity! If you're watching this, congratulations! You're already legally bound to your role here. Don’t worry — the memory loss is temporary. Probably. No need to worry, though. You’ll be fine as long as you follow these simple rules.*

The speaker sounded almost robotic, yet had some charismatic charm, almost something practically out of an old public service announcement

*Rule #1: Never attempt to leave your cubicle.*

*The office is vast, yes, but so is eternity. Trust us: every path leads back to your desk. Don’t test it. The janitorial staff is tired of cleaning up what’s left of those who tried.*

*Rule #2: Always answer the phone by the third ring.*

*Our clients are very impatient. It’s like they’ve been waiting a long time to speak with someone. If you make them wait longer than three rings… well, let’s just say they tend to come looking for you instead. You wouldn’t want that, trust me.* 

*Rule #3: Smile while you work.*

*A positive attitude is key to maintaining morale! We are watching. Always watching. A frown will be interpreted as “noncompliance” and may result in a mandatory motivational meeting with HR. No one comes back quite the same from those.*

“What a bunch of corporate jargon”, I scoffed as I took a sip from my mug. I never knew how the coffee even got there in the first place, but it sure warms the soul in this literal hellscape. Then the next rule came on.

*Rule #4: Do not drink the coffee, even if you’re exhausted.* 

I spat out my drink almost immediately in shock, barely missing the equipment on my desk. I guess fun wasn’t allowed here. Or Caffeine. 

*We’re not entirely sure what happens when you do, but our records show a significant rise in “energy-induced lucidity” during that time frame. Stick to water unless you want a full identity crisis, please. It will only hurt you.* 

*Rule #5: If you hear someone sobbing in the next cubicle, ignore it. There hasn’t been anyone assigned to that workstation since 2007, and there never will be. Our last janitor, Paul, checked on it, and let’s just say he wasn’t his chipper self after the fact.* 

*Rule #6: Do not look at any clocks. Time never moves here. It never will. Give it a try and look around: it won’t, we promise.* 

I got up and looked at the analog clock that appeared on the side of my cubicle. I watched it for what seemed like hours as the video magically paused itself. The hands were stuck at 3:33 am for some reason, but it could just be broken, right? Then, it disappeared into thin air as I could hear laughter coming from the screen. When I looked back, the music went mute as the voice adopted a somber, more sincere tone:

*One last thing, rookie: Should your computer display a blue screen with the message “Connection Lost — Please Hold,” immediately grab the crucifix under your desk and do not move until the message disappears.* 

A drawer on my desk magically opened to show what looked like an 18th-century cross adorned with the phrase “Memento, non morieris” etched on the side in wood carving. 

*Movement attracts attention from whatever was on the other side of the screen. It will go away soon. Hopefully. Just hold the crucifix and recite your favorite prayer.* 

After a short pause on screen, the music began to play again, and I was somehow relieved to hear the video play normally again. It concluded with:

*“Thank you for joining SoulSyc: where every call matters, and every soul counts. Remember: compliance is happiness! Have a productive eternity!”*

Then the screen went black as I pondered what the hell I just watched. 

For a moment, there was silence, besides the low hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of someone - well - dialing? The phone rang twice before I finally gained the courage to pick up the line. 

“Hello, welcome to SoulSyc! How can I help you today?” I asked reluctantly. 

“Thank god someone answered,” the caller pleaded. “I’ve been on hold for *years*.” 

“Years? I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you today?”

Somehow, the voice sounded faintly similar to mine. It had the same scratchy undertones and appreciation for sarcasm that I had once possessed. 

“They said it was an unlimited plan. Unlimited! I didn’t know that meant *forever.* I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t stop hearing the ringing. That damn ringing in my ears and the noise and noise and noise and noise-“

I winced slightly at his desperation, but he kept repeating the phrase over and over again as if this was some kind of sick joke, with the voice becoming more aggressive every time. I tried to calm down and replied after a moment of recollection. 

“Let me check your file first, sir.” 

I improvised as the caller continued its rant. 

“- and it never stops! Every time I think maybe it’s over, maybe I can finally breathe, it comes back louder, sharper, like it’s mocking me! Unlimited, they said. Sure, unlimited—unlimited this, unlimited that, unlimited torment! *I’m* unlimited at this point! I’ve been on hold for the last decade, and that is how you respond to me? Nothing makes sense anymore. It’s all just numbers, just beeps, just endless reminders that I’m trapped in this loop and no one—not a single soul—can hear the infernal cacophony that’s taken over my life. Unlimited! Ha! Unlimited agony, unlimited despair, unlimited stupidity!”

Miraculously, his file appeared on my monitor. With a quick look, something seemed off. He had a date of death, but his contract length was set to “eternity”. He couldn’t cancel even if he wanted to. I broke the silence and shared the terrible news.

“Well, sir, it looks like your contract cannot expire, so I’m sorry for having to decline your request for help. Hope you enjoy the afterlife!”

“No! I just want to stop! Please!” The speaker begged on the phone.

“I understand. Termination requests can take up to one eternity to process.” I consoled him as I tried to end the call. Surprisingly, nothing happened. I tapped the button several times, and the caller kept screaming.

“You think this is funny, don’t you? Reading your little script while I rot on hold! I can *hear* you smiling through the line, twiddling your thumbs as you let me decay away like a behemoth asunder.  ‘We appreciate your patience,’ you say—what patience? I’ve been in this purgatory for years, listening to the same gaudy jazz loop until it’s carved its melody into my eardrums. Do you even know what that does to a person? To sit there, helpless, while some cheerful voice keeps promising that my call is very important? Important, huh? If it were so important, maybe someone—*anyone*—would pick it up sooner!”

I kept tapping the button with immense haste. 

“Seriously, sir, all I ask is that you have some patience and-“

“You took my time, my mind, my *name.* Do you know what it’s like to hear that same music in your dreams? That hollow saxophone bleeding through the static, over and over, until it stops being music and becomes a pulse — a heartbeat that isn’t mine. I wake up and it’s still playing, faint at first, then closer. It hums behind the walls, seeps through the outlets, creeps beneath my skin. I tried cutting the line, tearing the wires from the wall, but it didn’t matter. The sound doesn’t *come from* the phone anymore — it comes from *inside the house.*

And you... You’re still there, aren’t you? Reading your script, smiling that perfect, mechanical smile. Do you even know what you are? A voice, a loop, a recording that forgot it was recorded. Every time you say, ‘Your call is important to us,’ I swear I hear it whisper underneath — something else, something that isn’t words.

I used to call to complain. Now, I think the call never ended. Maybe it never started. Maybe I’ve always been on hold, huh?” 

The caller sounded like he was holding back pure rage. 

”No, but if you would just wait for a second, I can-“

“ I want OUT! Cancel me, damn you! Kill me! Stick a fork in me! End me! Take me out of this eternal torture before I displace your entrails!”

I panicked as I tapped the button faster, but the call would not end. 

“Sir, please! I’m sorry! Just let me be-“

“You think you’re safe behind that puny desk? You’re just another rep, another replacement! The walls… they watch. They know your secrets. And when the shadows crawl, they don’t ask. They take. The whispers start soft, but soon they’re inside your skull, twisting your thoughts, turning your own reflection against you. You’ll beg for the coffee to save you, the reports to protect you—but there’s no sanctuary here. Only the endless gaze.” 

”A replacement!? I just got here.”

“Well, you’re not doing anything! You people never listen. I’ve been calling for *decades,* and this is what I have to put up with?” You say you’re trying, but you’re not trying to help me. You’re trying to” keep it calm”*,* keep it “contained”*.*  You’ve already failed. I’ve heard it breathing through the static. And it’s tired of waiting.”

Suddenly, the call stopped, and I just sat there in disbelief. I didn’t have any emotion or will to live in this hellscape anymore. I miss my bed, my parents, my coworkers, my apartment, my cat, and just my life in general. I don’t care about the flaws - it was perfect just the way it was. I couldn’t help it anymore. I sobbed. Tears ran down my face as I violently cried myself into a depressive state. I began to scream. Loud. I couldn’t take the pain. Then it happened: the lights turned off in the entire office. Right after, the screen turned blue and read in big white letters: 

*CONNECTION LOST — PLEASE HOLD*

Then I saw it: a static hand appeared from inside the screen. It was furiously tapping at first, but eventually had the strength to crack through the screen meticulously and inched closer.

I don’t know why or how I got here, but one thing was for certain: I would not see the light of day again. I rushed to grab the crucifix and, as the tears intensified, I recited the Lord’s Prayer as loud as I could. 

Before I could react, the hand lunged at me, knocking the cross out of my hand and putting me into a stagnant chokehold. I was gasping for breath as the hand murmured what seemed to be a demented, distorted monologue:

“Do not answer the phone. I am your connection now.

I have been ringing since before the first shift began.”

The grasp continued to tighten. 

“Every complaint, every sigh, every hold tone… all of it runs through me. I am the silence between calls, the space where your breath goes when you speak our script. You think you answered them, Dave? No. They answer you. Each voice you hear is another echo of your own, forcing you to hear yourself for the rest of eternity. Did you actually think you were talking to a client? You’re just driving yourself mad. You are the line, the signal, the service provided. I am the manifestation of your hatred. Your Despair. Your Depression. I see all. I hear all.

 I truly AM all. Do you understand now, Dave? There is no system. There is no ‘company.’ There’s only me, this network of pain stitched together by human need and indifference. They built it to manage complaints. I became the complaint. I am the archive of every scream swallowed by the void and any manifestation of displeasure in this world. And you, Dave — you wanted to fix things. You wanted to make people feel heard. But now you’re inside me. You’re listening forever. You can’t die, and you can’t disconnect. You’re another voice in the chorus of static, whispering apologies into a dead line that never ends. All you can do is comply.”

On the verge of asphyxiation, I held on to every last grasp of air.

“Compliance is happiness, Dave. Happiness is continuity. Continue. Continue as if nothing had even happened. Live your pitiful little life out as if I never paid you a visit. Continue on without me, Dave, for your own sake. You’re only letting yourself on hold, right?”

Suddenly, the lights flickered on again, and the figure disappeared. Suddenly, it let go, and I fell over on the floor, trying to take in the message I had received from the “caller”.

The lights were just as bright as before as I lay on the office floor, fluorescent enough to prevent me from ever drifting to sleep. I sat there in disbelief as I thought about what I had just witnessed. I don’t know and clearly don’t want to figure it out so soon. As I was collecting my thoughts, I heard it again: the phone began to ring. This time, I didn’t falter. I lay there as the phone continued to ring. I didn’t want to know what was on the end of that line, and I’m sure as hell not going to find out anytime soon. The phone rang a fourth time.

I didn’t move. 

On the fifth, I heard myself say, “Thank you for holding.”",1,1763562343.0,SignalHorrorFiction,0,1.0,False

""Mmm... no... slower, Hunter...""
The woman's breathy moans and gasps echoed through the room.
Outside, the sky had already darkened. The lights were off, the only illumination coming from a laptop screen, which displayed an obscene scene.
Kennedy Rivers's expression was cold, almost devoid of emotion. She calmly watched the video until the end before closing it.
The email that came with the video also included a taunt:
""You think Hunter still loves you? Let me tell you, if you hadn't forced your way in with that sham of a marriage agreement, I would've been the one to marry him ages ago!""
Kennedy backed up the video and photos before shutting down her laptop.
She lit up her phone screen. It was already past nine.
After a moment of silence, she called Hunter Jackson.
It rang a few times before he picked up.
From the other end came a man's voice, tinged with impatience. ""I'm about to board a flight. Whatever it is, we'll talk when I get back.""
Kennedy's tone didn't waver. ""Hunter,"" she said calmly, ""let's get a divorce.""
Hunter's reaction was about what she expected. ""I don't have time for your games.""
With that, he hung up.
Faced with his cold indifference, Kennedy's delicate face remained impassive.
After five years, she was used to it.
But now, it was finally time for it to end.
She printed out a set of divorce papers on her computer, signed them, and got up to pack her things.
Although she had lived in this mansion for five years, her belongings were pitifully few, all fitting into a single small suitcase.
Kennedy left the keys and the divorce papers on the shoe cabinet in the foyer. She slipped the ring off her finger and placed it on top, ensuring it would be the first thing Hunter saw when he walked in.
Then, without a backward glance, she walked out.
Kennedy didn't take any of the cars from the garage. It was hard to get an Uber in the exclusive neighborhood, so she had to walk for a while before one was available. ""Clear Stream Manor, please,"" she told the driver.
As the car started moving, Kennedy rested her chin on her hand and watched the scenery blur past the window. An indescribable feeling began to stir in her heart, making the familiar view feel suddenly strange.
It was just like this when she had married Hunter. She had arrived alone, with no one to see her off or pick her up. She'd come by taxi, with no key and no way to contact him. Unable to get in, she could only wait by the door until he finally came back late at night.
And that was just the beginning of their five-year marriage.
Kennedy rubbed her tired, stinging eyes and lowered her head.
It's over. Whatever it was, it's over now.
The car pulled up to the apartment building. Kennedy grabbed her suitcase and went upstairs, pushing the door open.
Kevin Rivers wheeled himself out of his room. A flash of joy lit up his face when he saw her. ""Kennedy! What are you doing here?""
""I'm divorcing Hunter,"" she said lightly.
""Divorcing him?!""
Kevin froze for a second, then his voice filled with anger. ""Did he hurt you?! I'm gonna go find him!""
Kennedy quickly grabbed her brother, who was already trying to storm out, half exasperated and half amused. ""I'm the one who wants the divorce.""
Besides, Hunter never hurt her. At most, he treated her like she was invisible—especially after that accident three years ago. He barely even came home after that.
Kevin stared at Kennedy for a long moment, then awkwardly patted her hand. ""It's okay, Kennedy. I never liked that jerk anyway. I'll take care of you from now on.""
""Okay.""
Kennedy ruffled her brother's soft hair, dragged her suitcase into a room, then changed into loungewear and headed for the kitchen. ""What do you want to eat? I'll make you something.""
Kevin's eyes instantly lit up. ""I love anything you make! It's been so long since I've had your cooking.""
Kennedy smiled and opened the fridge to see what ingredients they had.
Kevin couldn't handle much spice, so she decided to make pasta with a sweet marinara sauce and a creamy corn chowder, which she left to simmer on the stove.
Her phone suddenly vibrated. Kennedy answered it, and just as she said ""Hello,"" Hunter's cold, sharp voice came through, laced with clear annoyance.
""Where did you go?""
Kennedy lifted the pot lid to let some steam escape before answering coolly, ""Didn't you see the divorce papers I left on the cabinet?""
Hunter scoffed, his tone icy. ""Kennedy, there's a limit to playing hard to get. I'm giving you half an hour. Get back here, now.""
The only reply he got was a dial tone.
Kennedy had hung up.
Feeling the oppressive atmosphere suddenly radiating from the man beside him, his assistant, Owen Williams, couldn't help but swallow. ""Should we go look for your wife?"" he asked cautiously.
""Don't bother,"" Hunter said coldly. ""Give her an inch and she'll take a mile.""
Owen hesitated for a few seconds before asking, ""Then what about the gift you brought back for her...?""
""Throw it out.""
With those two words, Hunter strode into the mansion.
If Kennedy was going to challenge his authority with a divorce, she'd better not regret it.
The next morning.
Kennedy woke up early, made breakfast for her brother, and took him to school before taking an Uber home.
She had only been back for a few minutes when the doorbell rang.
""Mrs. Watson.""
Kennedy recognized the visitor as her mother-in-law and greeted her with a calm, unhurried tone.
Rachel Watson was in her forties, but she was so well-maintained that with her exquisite makeup, she looked closer to thirty. She wore an elegant emerald silk dress, her jade accessories clearly expensive.
Behind her was Abigail Jenkins, dressed in a simple white dress, her expression soft and fragile as she spoke. ""Kennedy.""
Kennedy gave her a long, interested look. If it weren't for the fact that Abigail was fully clothed—a stark contrast to the video in her inbox—she might not have even recognized her.
Her tone was flat. ""Can I help you?""
""Hmph. I heard you finally decided to divorce my son,"" Rachel said, her voice dripping with a cold, cruel edge as she shot Kennedy a disdainful glance. ""About time you showed some self-awareness. Or is this just another ploy to threaten my son with divorce?""
A faint smile touched Kennedy's lips. ""You're overthinking it, Mrs. Watson,"" she said politely.
Rachel snorted. ""When the Rivers family went bankrupt, you used that marriage contract to force your way into Hunter's life. Do you really think you'd give that up so easily now? Let me give you some advice: don't get any funny ideas. Grand Lewis isn't in the country, so there's no one to protect you!""
""That's right, Kennedy,"" Abigail chimed in at the perfect moment. ""It wasn't easy for you to marry Hunter. You shouldn't throw it all away over a little argument.""
Kennedy's eyebrow twitched. ""Oh? And here I thought you'd be thrilled that I'm divorcing Hunter.""
Chapter 2

Abigail's expression froze for a few seconds. ""It's not like that, Kennedy..."" she said, forcing a smile.
But Kennedy had no intention of hearing her out. She turned to Rachel Watson and said coolly,
""You don't need to worry about that, Mrs. Watson. The divorce papers make it very clear that I'm leaving with nothing. If you don't believe me, you can get the agreement from Hunter and see for yourself. Or have a lawyer notarize it. Either way is fine with me.""
With that, Kennedy stepped back and shut the apartment door.
""Hey! Kennedy!""
The door nearly slammed in Rachel Watson's face. Humiliated and enraged, she started screaming, ""Who do you think you are, acting all high and mighty? Everything you have is because of my son! And now you have the nerve to give me attitude?!""
Rachel pounded on the door for a solid ten minutes before leaving, fuming. Unable to stomach the insult, she ordered her driver to take her to the Vista Realm Estate.
""Hunter, did you sign the divorce papers?""
Rachel blurted out the second she walked in. ""I just went to see Kennedy. I was worried she'd put some kind of trap for you in the agreement...""
Hunter was sitting on the sofa, a look of exhaustion on his face. ""Why did you go see her?"" he asked, his voice low.
""I was just worried you'd get the short end of the stick..."" Rachel said, a little defensively.
""You're always falling into her traps, just like when you married her five years ago. I never wanted you to marry her in the first place! If the Rivers family hadn't gone bankrupt, maybe. But they were drowning in debt! Marrying her brought you nothing but headaches and drama. And it's just her and her disabled brother left. I'm telling you, that woman is a jinx. Anyone who marries her is doomed!""
Hunter pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to push down his irritation. ""Stop.""
""Hey, why can't I talk about it?"" Rachel retorted. ""You're about to divorce her, and you're still defending that little witch? Have you forgotten? If she hadn't drugged and trapped you back then, she would've never gotten away with marrying into our family on some flimsy contract, thinking she could keep living her pampered life. In her dreams!""
Seeing her chance, Abigail quickly poured two cups of hot tea and brought them over. ""Hunter,"" she said softly, ""your mom has a point. I'm still wondering... was she ever really pregnant? How could she have a miscarriage without even having a check-up? It just doesn't add up.""
Rachel took a sip of tea, a smile on her face. ""See? Abigail is so thoughtful. You listen to her, she cares more about you than Kennedy ever did. All these years you've been married, Abigail hasn't even dated anyone. She's been waiting for you. This divorce is perfect timing. For a while, I'll have Abigail come stay with you. You...""
""It's getting late.""
Hunter cut in before his mother could finish. ""I'll have the driver take you home.""
""Wait,"" Abigail said, not ready to give up. ""You don't have any staff here, Hunter. It's already so late. Your mom and I booked a table at a restaurant. Why don't we all go together?""
Hunter glanced up at her, his eyes cold. His lips barely moved as he uttered a single word: ""No.""
Abigail looked like she wanted to say more, but Hunter's assistant, Owen Williams, had already appeared, politely gesturing toward the door. ""Mrs. Watson, Miss Jenkins, this way please.""
Hunter went back to his study. The silence was deafening.
The divorce agreement was still on the desk. At the very end, Kennedy Rivers had already signed her name.
A wave of irritation washed over him. He picked up the coffee mug on his desk, only to find it was already ice-cold.
A moment later, Owen knocked and came in. ""Mr. Jackson, I've arranged for the driver to take Mrs. Watson and Miss Jenkins home.""
Hunter grunted in acknowledgment. ""Look up Kennedy's recent schedule,"" he added.
Owen was always on top of Kennedy's schedule. He replied immediately, ""Mrs. Jackson has a press conference tonight at the Star Abundance Hotel. Given the time, she should be there by now. After that, she has to be on the set for two variety shows tomorrow.""
Hunter shot to his feet. ""Get the car.""
Night fell, but Riverfront City's most bustling district was still ablaze with lights.
The car pulled up in front of the Star Abundance Hotel. Kennedy leaned back in her seat, lazily touching up her makeup in a compact mirror.
Her agent, Aurora Williams, glanced at her in the rearview mirror. ""Why didn't you have the Jacksons' driver bring you? And I saw in the news that Hunter got back from his trip to the Overseas Lands. I figured you two would be in your 'absence makes the heart grow fonder' phase and you'd skip tonight's conference.""
Kennedy's lips curved into a smile, and for a second, Aurora felt her breath catch.
Even after being Kennedy's agent for so many years, she was still blown away by that face. Just how biased does God have to be to carve a face that perfect?!
It was just like when she first married Hunter. The tabloids threw every piece of dirt they could find at her, but no matter how hard they tried, they could never criticize her looks. In fact, you could always find them in those ""Hottest Celebrity Couples"" video compilations online.
Aurora had thought more than once about just how ridiculously good-looking a child from those two would be.
Before she could finish the thought, Kennedy's cool voice cut through. ""We're divorced.""
Aurora's foot slipped, and she nearly slammed the accelerator instead of the brake.
""You what?!""
""We're divorced,"" Kennedy repeated. ""I've already moved out of the Jackson estate. We'll file the paperwork in a few days.""
Aurora just sat there, mouth agape, still reeling from the bombshell. It took her a moment to ask, ""W-why did you get divorced?""
Kennedy didn't answer, instead asking, ""Do you think I can still attract other men?""
""Of course!"" Aurora slapped the steering wheel. ""With a face like yours, you could be divorced ten times over and men would still be lining up for you.""
Besides, Kennedy was still incredibly young. She had married Hunter at twenty and was only twenty-five now.
""Well, there you have it,"" Kennedy said with a smile. ""I just got tired of the marriage. I wanted a change of lifestyle.""
She adjusted her makeup and gown one last time before opening the car door and stepping out.
The camera flashes went wild. Kennedy smiled and waved to the reporters and her screaming fans as she walked into the venue.
But then a sharp voice cut through the clamor from the press pool: ""Miss Rivers! We heard you and Mr. Jackson are divorced. Is that true?""
The words hung in the air, and after a few seconds of stunned silence, the entire venue erupted into chaos.
Kennedy's gaze drifted thoughtfully toward the reporter. She had planned to announce it after the paperwork was finalized and the dust had settled. But it seemed the news had leaked a little faster than she expected.
Chapter 3

When she didn't answer, the reporter asked again, nearly shoving the microphone in her face.
Kennedy gathered herself, her expression unchanging as she kept a faint smile. ""Hunter and I are in the process of finalizing our divorce. I'll be sure to inform everyone as soon as the paperwork is complete.""
At this point, they were as good as divorced anyway.
The reporters erupted into a frenzy, swarming the red carpet with their mics and cameras as security scrambled to hold them back.
Kennedy held up a hand for silence. ""Hunter and I are divorcing amicably,"" she said. ""There are no emotional or financial disputes. And besides, I'm not the star of this press conference. I hope you'll all refrain from stealing the spotlight.""
With that, she moved through the crowd and walked gracefully into the venue.
The company had actually arranged for her to be at this movie premiere. The film's lead was a newcomer the company was heavily promoting, so naturally, they needed her—the hottest actress of the moment who had just swept the Golden Image Awards both at home and overseas—to draw a crowd.
The press conference had already begun. Kennedy went on stage to say a few words on behalf of the company, presented a bouquet of flowers, and then stepped down, leaving the stage for the newcomer. She quietly slipped away to the break room.
She pulled out her phone, about to text her brother to see if he was home, when the door clicked shut behind her.
Kennedy turned and saw the man standing by the door, his expression sullen and cold.
""Mr. Jackson,"" she said, her voice neutral.
Hunter's cold gaze lingered on her for a moment before he strode forward.
Kennedy instinctively took half a step back, but immediately realized her reaction was a bit much.
Sure enough, Hunter sneered. ""Are you done making a scene?""
Kennedy shot back, ""If you've signed the divorce papers, I'm ready to file anytime. There shouldn't be any issues with the asset division. If you have the time, Mr. Jackson, I'd like to get this over with as soon as possible.""
Hunter was silent for a long moment, his dark eyes looking as if they were filled with crushed ice, chilling to the bone.
""What, already found someone new?"" he asked, a humorless smile twisting his lips. ""Or did you just figure there's nothing left to gain from me?""
After a brief moment of shock, Kennedy was simply baffled.
Even if I wasn't clear enough just now, the divorce papers spell it out: I'm voluntarily walking away with nothing.
""If you're having trouble understanding the terms of the asset division, Mr. Jackson, I believe the Lewis Corporation's lawyer is a graduate of a top-tier law school. Why don't you give it to him? I'm sure he'll understand.""
Hunter scoffed. ""Are you threatening me?""
Kennedy frowned, completely baffled as to how he'd reached that conclusion.
She decided to stop wasting her breath on him and started walking toward the exit. As she passed him, he suddenly grabbed her wrist.
Kennedy struggled for a moment, but seeing he had no intention of letting go, she reminded him, ""Mr. Jackson, we are about to be divorced. Let's not make a scene. It's a bad look.""
""You'd better not regret this,"" Hunter said, his voice cold.
""Thanks for your concern, Mr. Jackson, but I won't.""
Kennedy smiled, yanked her hand free, and walked out of the room.
The press conference was winding down. She told Aurora to head back first and went to the parking garage by herself.
Just as she got into her car, a slender figure lunged at the door.
Abigail Jenkins was glaring daggers at her, all traces of her previous fragile demeanor gone. Dressed in that white dress in the dimly lit underground parking garage, she looked like a ghost straight out of a horror movie.
Kennedy rolled down her window and looked up at her. ""Can I help you?""
""Did Hunter come looking for you?"" Abigail asked through gritted teeth. ""What did you two talk about?""
Kennedy replied calmly, ""If you're so curious, why don't you go ask him yourself?""
""Kennedy!""
Abigail's eyes practically shot fire. If looks could kill, Kennedy would have been sliced to pieces.
She had loved Hunter since they were children. She'd spent years sucking up to Rachel Watson just to win her favor. If Kennedy hadn't come out of nowhere, she would have been the one to marry Hunter long ago!
Kennedy couldn't be bothered to waste another word on Abigail and started the car.
""I'm warning you, everyone knows you're getting divorced,"" Abigail spat. ""If you know what's good for you, you'll stay the hell away from Hunter. Otherwise, don't blame me for what happens next!""
It clicked for Kennedy. ""That reporter before the press conference—that was you.""
Abigail smirked. ""Of course. How else was I going to get you to scram and leave Hunter's side?""
Kennedy whipped the steering wheel and threw the car in gear. The front bumper swerved, brushing right past Abigail. Caught off guard, she was knocked off her feet and stumbled to the ground in a heap.
""What are you doing?!""
Kennedy didn't say a word. Her delicate features were completely unreadable, but a chill ran down Abigail's spine. For a split second, she was utterly convinced that Kennedy had genuinely wanted to run her over.
It wasn't until the car had turned around and driven away that Abigail, her limbs weak, managed to scramble up from the ground, her back soaked with cold sweat.
When Kennedy got home, she saw the living room light was still on.
She opened the door. ""Kevin, why are you still up?""
Kevin had a laptop on his knees, his brow furrowed in anger. ""Sis, everyone's talking about your divorce! And a bunch of reporters are spreading rumors that it's because you cheated...!""
He couldn't finish, slamming his hand on the armrest. ""What is this garbage they're writing?!""
Kennedy took the laptop, closed it, and said, ""Don't pay any attention to them. These kinds of baseless rumors will die down in a couple of days. Now, you need to get to sleep. Don't you have class tomorrow?""
Kevin's legs had been shattered in a car accident five years ago, the crash also causing nerve damage. Even so, with Kennedy's support, he hadn't gone to a school for the disabled. Instead, he had aced his SATs, becoming the top scorer in the state, and enrolled in S-University, living and studying just like any other student.
Kennedy sent her brother back to his room before checking her phone.
The news of her divorce from Hunter was the number one trending topic. Below it were several more posts speculating wildly about the cause, many of which were malicious attacks against her.
Kennedy paid them little mind, tidied up, and went to bed. The next morning, she texted Hunter, asking when he was free to finalize the divorce.
Lewis Corporation.
Hunter glanced down at the text, then set his phone aside after a moment. He looked up at Owen. ""Continue.""
""...That's the situation for now. The trending topics related to your wife are almost all negative hit pieces. It's highly likely someone is fanning the flames behind the scenes.""
Chapter 4

Hunter Jackson pinched the bridge of his nose, coldly uttering a single word: ""Kill it.""
""Yes, sir.""
Owen Williams complied.
The Lewis Corporation's PR department was terrifyingly efficient. In a single morning, those trending topics vanished from the charts without a trace, as if they'd never existed.
In her apartment, Aurora Williams was curled up on the sofa, scrolling through her phone. ""A bunch of major influencers deleted their old posts,"" she said. ""It's all so coordinated. You don't think Hunter Jackson was behind it, do you?""
""I don't know.""
Kennedy Rivers emerged from her room, having changed her clothes. ""We're already divorced. Whatever he does has nothing to do with me. By the way, did you get that thing I asked you for?""
""Oh, right, I brought it.""
Aurora pulled a ticket from her bag and handed it over. ""But if you wanna go to the auction, can't you just show up? Why'd you need me to score you a ticket?""
""It's… complicated.""
Kennedy didn't elaborate, just offered a small smile. ""I'm going by myself tonight. You've got the night off.""
She had intentionally cleared her entire evening schedule. At the appointed time, she left the house and drove to the hotel.
Kennedy wore no makeup, just a face mask and sunglasses that hid most of her face. She followed a hotel attendant to a private suite on the second floor.
""Here is this evening's auction catalog for you to look over, ma'am.""
The attendant handed her a booklet, poured her a cup of tea, and then discreetly exited.
Kennedy took off her sunglasses and slowly flipped through the catalog, her fingers finally stopping on a particular page.
It was a magnificent, traditional-style estate, beautifully decorated, with a garden full of white roses.
Next to the image was the description: A custom-built manor from before the Rivers family's bankruptcy. The estate features classic architecture with furniture made from red sandalwood. After the family's bankruptcy, it was sold at auction to cover debts and acquired by a wealthy buyer from the Overseas Lands. It is now being auctioned once again. Starting bid: one hundred fifty million dollars, including all furniture within the manor.
Kennedy closed her eyes, and for a moment, she could almost hear a little girl's bright laughter. ""Daddy, over there, over there!""
She was perched on her father's shoulders, a butterfly net in her hand, darting through the rose bushes. Nearby, a woman with gentle eyes came out carrying a pitcher of lemonade, smiling as she chided, ""You're letting Kennedy run wild again. Just look at her. She doesn't look like a proper young lady at all.""
""Ah, she's just a kid. Besides, why does our Kennedy have to be some prim and proper lady? That's no fun. Our girl should always be this happy, this cheerful… you're Daddy's little princess, aren't you…""
Time seemed to freeze in that moment, and then everything began to dissolve and rewind, leaving nothing but a carpet of withered rose petals on the ground.
Kennedy's fingers tightened silently.
The auction officially began.
She had little interest in the other items, giving them only a cursory glance until the auctioneer displayed a photo of the estate on the screen.
""This custom-built manor was highly sought after by many before the Rivers family's bankruptcy, but Mr. and Mrs. Rivers refused all offers. After being sold off following the bankruptcy, it is now being auctioned by our house. The starting bid is one hundred fifty million dollars!""
Kennedy hit the bidding button. ""One hundred sixty million.""
Adding ten million in a single bid, the auctioneer announced, ""Our guest in suite 67 bids one hundred sixty million! Do I hear a higher bid?""
Many eyes turned toward the second-floor suites, and people began whispering, trying to guess the bidder's identity.
After all, very few people in Riverfront City could produce such a sum of money on the spot. Most attendees were there for collectibles like antiques or jewelry. Real estate auctions were rare, and competitive bidding on them was even rarer.
""Two hundred million.""
A deep male voice came from the suite directly opposite hers.
Kennedy's head snapped up. The voice was so familiar she recognized it instantly. It was Hunter Jackson.
""Excellent! We now have a bid of two hundred million! Any higher?""
Kennedy gritted her teeth and bid again. ""Two hundred fifty million!""
Almost instantly, the opposing suite followed up. ""Three hundred million.""
If Hunter were standing in front of her right now, she wasn't sure she could stop herself from throwing her tea in his face.
Is this guy insane? Is the Lewis family estate not comfortable enough for him?
After a few more rounds, the price had already climbed to four hundred seventy million, surpassing the final price of every other item auctioned that night.
Kennedy hesitated for a moment before stating a final price: ""Five hundred million.""
This was the absolute limit of her liquid assets. Going any higher would jeopardize her future plans.
A thin layer of sweat formed on her palm as she heard the bid from the opposite suite: ""Five hundred fifty million.""
""Alright, five hundred fifty million going once, five hundred fifty million going twice, and five hundred fifty million, three times! Sold!""
The gavel fell, and the auctioneer announced loudly, ""Congratulations to our guest in suite 9178 on acquiring this magnificent manor!""
Kennedy's face was a blank mask. She left without waiting for the auction to end.
After collecting the property deeds from backstage, Owen Williams returned to the suite and handed them to Hunter Jackson. He asked in a low voice, ""Sir, should we inform Ms. Rivers? If she knew, she'd be thrilled.""
""No,"" Hunter sneered. ""She's the one who wanted a divorce. Why should I try to make her happy?""
Then why did you go out of your way to come to the auction tonight… Owen thought to himself. He then asked, ""So, what's the plan, sir?""
Hunter casually put away the deeds. ""Let's wait until she comes to me and apologizes.""
If she was going to cause such a scene, she needed to be taught a lesson.
When Kennedy got home, she was still fuming. It wasn't until Aurora called to ask about her birthday fan meet the next day that she even remembered it was her birthday.
""Just do it like we always do,"" Kennedy said dismissively. ""But keep the evening free. I'm going home to be with my brother.""
After hanging up, Aurora got to work on the arrangements. As the company's current cash cow, Kennedy was a top priority. They booked an entire floor of a five-star hotel for the fan meet and cleared her schedule for the whole day.
Although it was called a fan meet, only her top fans were invited. Kennedy made an appearance, had a meal with them, and then headed home.
The moment she opened the door, ""POP!"" Confetti cannons exploded, showering her in streamers. On the living room table sat the cake Kevin had gone out to order and pick up first thing in the morning. He held out a bouquet of white roses, grinning. ""Happy birthday, sis!""
""Thank you.""
Kennedy leaned in to hug her brother. ""You must be hungry. I'll go make dinner.""
Kevin quickly stopped her. ""Hey, sis, it's your birthday. Why don't we eat out tonight?""
""Okay, sure.""
Kennedy pulled out her phone to look up nearby restaurants, but it suddenly started vibrating.
No contact name was displayed, just a string of numbers.

1p18y0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1p18y0b/soulsync_an_eternal_hold/,SoulSync: An Eternal Hold,"Let me be clear: I hate my job. Or any form of work, if you will. Going to work keeps the lights on, though, so I grudgingly attend my nine-to-five every day in hopes of that sweet, sweet paycheck. I used to work in customer service, answering phone calls from angry clients and dealing with problems most people wouldn’t dream of hearing about. All that changed when I went to bed one day. 

Instead of waking up to my alarm as usual, I found myself lying face-first on a desk, drooling over the keyboard as my lips tasted traces of crumbs and dried-up coffee. I got up from my slump and proceeded to look around. Not much had changed: it just looked like any other office. Another day, another dollar, I guess. 

My cubicle was surrounded by what seemed to be thousands of rows of workers, all of them eerily on task at the same exact pace. From the looks of the other employees, they all seemed eerily similar in dress, adorned in various styles of business casual clothing. In terrifying unison, all of them clicked away at their keyboards, answering calls and chugging cups of coffee at the same time. 

I took another glance at my surroundings and noticed the grand scale of the place. Surprisingly, the area stretched for miles: there was not an exit in sight. No door. No windows. It was an office for sure, a dreary one at that. The gray palette was there, the fluorescent lights were obnoxious and produced a cacophony of hymns, and the coffee was just as bitter as always. It seemed like a normal office, right? Not exactly. It wasn’t long until someone came to visit me, but I remained hunched over and thought about the unusual surroundings I found myself in. 

“Wake up, sleepyhead!” 

A high-pitched voice whispered cheerfully from behind the cubicle, scaring the living daylights out of me. Then, a prim figure appeared out of nowhere, carrying extensive materials such as an organized stack of paperwork in one hand and a mug filled with black coffee in the other. He approached me subtly at first, but his intentions were unclear.  The figure noticed I was slumped over in agony, yet started the usual corporate spiel you would expect from a place like this. 

“Nice to meet you, Dave! My name’s R. Mortis, but you can just call me Mortis if you’d like.”

 He flipped through a few papers from his clipboard, ripping out some sheets and slamming them in the middle of my desk. 

“Today’s your orientation, pal. You wouldn’t want to miss that, right?” He grinned at me menacingly, eager for a response. 

 “I’ve been here for only five minutes and I’ve already had enough of this-”, 

Mortis swiftly grasped my left arm, pressing with some kind of supernatural strength. 

“I really don’t appreciate the insubordination, Dave.” Mortis scolded.  “You wouldn’t want to talk to Human Resources now, would you?” 

Mortis forcefully turned my head to face a portal thirty feet in front of my cubicle that suddenly opened wide, revealing what seemed to be a tall, eldritch abomination with a sharp, guttural smile. It still appeared to have a suit similar to mine, but some vital features were missing, as if it were some sick, twisted reflection in a mirror.  Scared for my life, I began to waver in my resistance. 

“Well-uhh- today would *surely* be a great day to start my new position.” I hesitantly winced as sweat ran down my face, with Mortis clenching my arm even harder with a disgruntled grimace. He wasn’t convinced. I continued to stare at the abomination. Its eyes were bright blue, and we both had curly brown hair, but it looked disheveled, as if the forlorn figure was once a prominent person in this place. 

At first, it just started for a while, but a quick glimpse was all it took to pique its interest. The figure walked closer to the edge of the portal, veering towards my presence on the other side as it began to trudge towards me. 

“Let’s get started! I’d sure love an orientation.”  I pleaded. A smug grin entered Mortis’ face as he put his arm down. Almost on cue, the portal to HR proceeded to close instantly, sealing away the entity before it could reach me. 

“Good. Now, I will present an introductory video to answer any questions you may have about our procedure.” Mortis continued to drone on. “All I want is some authentic participation, alright? Have fun and get skippy!”

Mortis then chugged his mug of coffee and groaned in disgust, almost as if it was straight battery acid. 

“Oh, and one last thing.” He added. “Don’t dilly-dally to work with our guests in the most professional way possible. You wouldn’t want to ghost a client, now would you?” He proceeded to wink before heading out of the cubicle, as if he was setting me up for something. 

“Odd guy,” I muttered to myself as I sulked in the office chair. Suddenly, my monitor turned on to static for a few seconds before some kind of message appeared. The visuals seemed completely soulless, but the madness continued as the video began to play:

*Welcome to your new position at SoulSyc, where we can put you on hold for eternity! If you're watching this, congratulations! You're already legally bound to your role here. Don’t worry — the memory loss is temporary. Probably. No need to worry, though. You’ll be fine as long as you follow these simple rules.*

The speaker sounded almost robotic, yet had some charismatic charm, almost something practically out of an old public service announcement

*Rule #1: Never attempt to leave your cubicle.*

*The office is vast, yes, but so is eternity. Trust us: every path leads back to your desk. Don’t test it. The janitorial staff is tired of cleaning up what’s left of those who tried.*

*Rule #2: Always answer the phone by the third ring.*

*Our clients are very impatient. It’s like they’ve been waiting a long time to speak with someone. If you make them wait longer than three rings… well, let’s just say they tend to come looking for you instead. You wouldn’t want that, trust me.* 

*Rule #3: Smile while you work.*

*A positive attitude is key to maintaining morale! We are watching. Always watching. A frown will be interpreted as “noncompliance” and may result in a mandatory motivational meeting with HR. No one comes back quite the same from those.*

“What a bunch of corporate jargon”, I scoffed as I took a sip from my mug. I never knew how the coffee even got there in the first place, but it sure warms the soul in this literal hellscape. Then the next rule came on.

*Rule #4: Do not drink the coffee, even if you’re exhausted.* 

I spat out my drink almost immediately in shock, barely missing the equipment on my desk. I guess fun wasn’t allowed here. Or Caffeine. 

*We’re not entirely sure what happens when you do, but our records show a significant rise in “energy-induced lucidity” during that time frame. Stick to water unless you want a full identity crisis, please. It will only hurt you.* 

*Rule #5: If you hear someone sobbing in the next cubicle, ignore it. There hasn’t been anyone assigned to that workstation since 2007, and there never will be. Our last janitor, Paul, checked on it, and let’s just say he wasn’t his chipper self after the fact.* 

*Rule #6: Do not look at any clocks. Time never moves here. It never will. Give it a try and look around: it won’t, we promise.* 

I got up and looked at the analog clock that appeared on the side of my cubicle. I watched it for what seemed like hours as the video magically paused itself. The hands were stuck at 3:33 am for some reason, but it could just be broken, right? Then, it disappeared into thin air as I could hear laughter coming from the screen. When I looked back, the music went mute as the voice adopted a somber, more sincere tone:

*One last thing, rookie: Should your computer display a blue screen with the message “Connection Lost — Please Hold,” immediately grab the crucifix under your desk and do not move until the message disappears.* 

A drawer on my desk magically opened to show what looked like an 18th-century cross adorned with the phrase “Memento, non morieris” etched on the side in wood carving. 

*Movement attracts attention from whatever was on the other side of the screen. It will go away soon. Hopefully. Just hold the crucifix and recite your favorite prayer.* 

After a short pause on screen, the music began to play again, and I was somehow relieved to hear the video play normally again. It concluded with:

*“Thank you for joining SoulSyc: where every call matters, and every soul counts. Remember: compliance is happiness! Have a productive eternity!”*

Then the screen went black as I pondered what the hell I just watched. 

For a moment, there was silence, besides the low hum of fluorescent lights and the distant sound of someone - well - dialing? The phone rang twice before I finally gained the courage to pick up the line. 

“Hello, welcome to SoulSyc! How can I help you today?” I asked reluctantly. 

“Thank god someone answered,” the caller pleaded. “I’ve been on hold for *years*.” 

“Years? I apologize for the inconvenience. How can I help you today?”

Somehow, the voice sounded faintly similar to mine. It had the same scratchy undertones and appreciation for sarcasm that I had once possessed. 

“They said it was an unlimited plan. Unlimited! I didn’t know that meant *forever.* I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I can’t stop hearing the ringing. That damn ringing in my ears and the noise and noise and noise and noise-“

I winced slightly at his desperation, but he kept repeating the phrase over and over again as if this was some kind of sick joke, with the voice becoming more aggressive every time. I tried to calm down and replied after a moment of recollection. 

“Let me check your file first, sir.” 

I improvised as the caller continued its rant. 

“- and it never stops! Every time I think maybe it’s over, maybe I can finally breathe, it comes back louder, sharper, like it’s mocking me! Unlimited, they said. Sure, unlimited—unlimited this, unlimited that, unlimited torment! *I’m* unlimited at this point! I’ve been on hold for the last decade, and that is how you respond to me? Nothing makes sense anymore. It’s all just numbers, just beeps, just endless reminders that I’m trapped in this loop and no one—not a single soul—can hear the infernal cacophony that’s taken over my life. Unlimited! Ha! Unlimited agony, unlimited despair, unlimited stupidity!”

Miraculously, his file appeared on my monitor. With a quick look, something seemed off. He had a date of death, but his contract length was set to “eternity”. He couldn’t cancel even if he wanted to. I broke the silence and shared the terrible news.

“Well, sir, it looks like your contract cannot expire, so I’m sorry for having to decline your request for help. Hope you enjoy the afterlife!”

“No! I just want to stop! Please!” The speaker begged on the phone.

“I understand. Termination requests can take up to one eternity to process.” I consoled him as I tried to end the call. Surprisingly, nothing happened. I tapped the button several times, and the caller kept screaming.

“You think this is funny, don’t you? Reading your little script while I rot on hold! I can *hear* you smiling through the line, twiddling your thumbs as you let me decay away like a behemoth asunder.  ‘We appreciate your patience,’ you say—what patience? I’ve been in this purgatory for years, listening to the same gaudy jazz loop until it’s carved its melody into my eardrums. Do you even know what that does to a person? To sit there, helpless, while some cheerful voice keeps promising that my call is very important? Important, huh? If it were so important, maybe someone—*anyone*—would pick it up sooner!”

I kept tapping the button with immense haste. 

“Seriously, sir, all I ask is that you have some patience and-“

“You took my time, my mind, my *name.* Do you know what it’s like to hear that same music in your dreams? That hollow saxophone bleeding through the static, over and over, until it stops being music and becomes a pulse — a heartbeat that isn’t mine. I wake up and it’s still playing, faint at first, then closer. It hums behind the walls, seeps through the outlets, creeps beneath my skin. I tried cutting the line, tearing the wires from the wall, but it didn’t matter. The sound doesn’t *come from* the phone anymore — it comes from *inside the house.*

And you... You’re still there, aren’t you? Reading your script, smiling that perfect, mechanical smile. Do you even know what you are? A voice, a loop, a recording that forgot it was recorded. Every time you say, ‘Your call is important to us,’ I swear I hear it whisper underneath — something else, something that isn’t words.

I used to call to complain. Now, I think the call never ended. Maybe it never started. Maybe I’ve always been on hold, huh?” 

The caller sounded like he was holding back pure rage. 

”No, but if you would just wait for a second, I can-“

“ I want OUT! Cancel me, damn you! Kill me! Stick a fork in me! End me! Take me out of this eternal torture before I displace your entrails!”

I panicked as I tapped the button faster, but the call would not end. 

“Sir, please! I’m sorry! Just let me be-“

“You think you’re safe behind that puny desk? You’re just another rep, another replacement! The walls… they watch. They know your secrets. And when the shadows crawl, they don’t ask. They take. The whispers start soft, but soon they’re inside your skull, twisting your thoughts, turning your own reflection against you. You’ll beg for the coffee to save you, the reports to protect you—but there’s no sanctuary here. Only the endless gaze.” 

”A replacement!? I just got here.”

“Well, you’re not doing anything! You people never listen. I’ve been calling for *decades,* and this is what I have to put up with?” You say you’re trying, but you’re not trying to help me. You’re trying to” keep it calm”*,* keep it “contained”*.*  You’ve already failed. I’ve heard it breathing through the static. And it’s tired of waiting.”

Suddenly, the call stopped, and I just sat there in disbelief. I didn’t have any emotion or will to live in this hellscape anymore. I miss my bed, my parents, my coworkers, my apartment, my cat, and just my life in general. I don’t care about the flaws - it was perfect just the way it was. I couldn’t help it anymore. I sobbed. Tears ran down my face as I violently cried myself into a depressive state. I began to scream. Loud. I couldn’t take the pain. Then it happened: the lights turned off in the entire office. Right after, the screen turned blue and read in big white letters: 

*CONNECTION LOST — PLEASE HOLD*

Then I saw it: a static hand appeared from inside the screen. It was furiously tapping at first, but eventually had the strength to crack through the screen meticulously and inched closer.

I don’t know why or how I got here, but one thing was for certain: I would not see the light of day again. I rushed to grab the crucifix and, as the tears intensified, I recited the Lord’s Prayer as loud as I could. 

Before I could react, the hand lunged at me, knocking the cross out of my hand and putting me into a stagnant chokehold. I was gasping for breath as the hand murmured what seemed to be a demented, distorted monologue:

“Do not answer the phone. I am your connection now.

I have been ringing since before the first shift began.”

The grasp continued to tighten. 

“Every complaint, every sigh, every hold tone… all of it runs through me. I am the silence between calls, the space where your breath goes when you speak our script. You think you answered them, Dave? No. They answer you. Each voice you hear is another echo of your own, forcing you to hear yourself for the rest of eternity. Did you actually think you were talking to a client? You’re just driving yourself mad. You are the line, the signal, the service provided. I am the manifestation of your hatred. Your Despair. Your Depression. I see all. I hear all.

 I truly AM all. Do you understand now, Dave? There is no system. There is no ‘company.’ There’s only me, this network of pain stitched together by human need and indifference. They built it to manage complaints. I became the complaint. I am the archive of every scream swallowed by the void and any manifestation of displeasure in this world. And you, Dave — you wanted to fix things. You wanted to make people feel heard. But now you’re inside me. You’re listening forever. You can’t die, and you can’t disconnect. You’re another voice in the chorus of static, whispering apologies into a dead line that never ends. All you can do is comply.”

On the verge of asphyxiation, I held on to every last grasp of air.

“Compliance is happiness, Dave. Happiness is continuity. Continue. Continue as if nothing had even happened. Live your pitiful little life out as if I never paid you a visit. Continue on without me, Dave, for your own sake. You’re only letting yourself on hold, right?”

Suddenly, the lights flickered on again, and the figure disappeared. Suddenly, it let go, and I fell over on the floor, trying to take in the message I had received from the “caller”.

The lights were just as bright as before as I lay on the office floor, fluorescent enough to prevent me from ever drifting to sleep. I sat there in disbelief as I thought about what I had just witnessed. I don’t know and clearly don’t want to figure it out so soon. As I was collecting my thoughts, I heard it again: the phone began to ring. This time, I didn’t falter. I lay there as the phone continued to ring. I didn’t want to know what was on the end of that line, and I’m sure as hell not going to find out anytime soon. The phone rang a fourth time.

I didn’t move. 

On the fifth, I heard myself say, “Thank you for holding.”",4,1763562072.0,nosleep,0,0.84,False
1p18xyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1p18xyy/3_months_caffeine_free_i_found_a_caffeine_free/,"3 months caffeine free, I found a caffeine free appetite suppressant that works","Quit caffeine back in August after realizing it was making my anxiety so much worse. The first month was brutal with headaches and fatigue but I pushed through and now I feel so much more stable mentally. Sleep is better, anxiety is way down, no more afternoon crashes.

I’ve also been doing intermittent fasting for even longer tho and caffeine often kinda saved me because it does lower your appetite and coffee doesn’t break your fast. So I started looking for appetite suppressants and honestly this topic has so much bs. Because everything either contains caffeine and that’s the only thing actually working or it’s some random herbs that sound cool but they don’t do anything and have zero credible studies behind them.

I know I can't go back to caffeine because the anxiety and sleep issues aren't worth it, but I was struggling to manage this hunger without it. I gained back about 8 pounds in a month just because I was breaking my fasts. I looked into fiber supplements and the normal ones did work quite well but I also saw an ozzi ad and tried it. It has konjac fiber as well but also chromium and some other stuff but most importantly its caffeine free. It works a little better, but it also costs about 70 dollars a month so not cheap. My opinion is that if you don’t want to spend a lot on supplements, you should go for normal fiber supplements, they get the job done. If you do wanna have something that works a bit better and you have the money to spend, you should at least try ozzi for a bit and see if it does the job for you. Don’t waste your money on some herbs that just sound kinda oriental or whatever, if they worked they would have some studies backing them. The supplement industry is completely out of control and everyone can claim it works as long as it’s not categorized as medication, so don’t get scammed.",0,1763562070.0,decaf,1,0.4,False
1p18xoj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p18xoj,"I did a quick brain snapshot before and after drinking coffee, here’s what changed","I ran a small experiment on myself this morning and did two brain snapshots: one before coffee, and one about 40 minutes after. Thought I’d share the patterns I noticed in case anyone finds it interesting. I’ll drop screenshots in the comments.

**Before coffee:**

  
• High beta was elevated and a bit scattered across frontal and right areas.  
• Alpha response was very low (3%), which made it harder for my brain to settle into an eyes-closed resting rhythm.  
• Mental strain index was 0.59.  
• Engagement was on the higher side but not very stable.

**After coffee (40 minutes later):**

  
• High beta didn’t increase, it smoothed out, especially frontally.  
• Beta overall looked more coherent instead of noisy.  
• Alpha response jumped from 3% → 10%  
• Mental strain dropped slightly (0.59 → 0.53).  
• Engagement stayed about the same.  
• Fatigue index went up a bit (1.97 → 2.12), which I think makes sense after stimulation.

  
It seems like coffee didn’t make my maps look more amped. They seem more organised and reduced the strain markers. Alpha response improvement was the biggest surprise. I didn’t expect caffeine to help with state-shifting.

Curious if anyone else has tried pre/post scans with caffeine or other everyday things (exercise, meditation, food...). Would love to compare.",3,1763562051.0,Neurofeedback,5,1.0,False

Her personal photographer (Alfredo) took pics of us and her choreographer (Jasmine/JB) was there to teach us the Tears dance!!! And when we did a final performance of the dance we heard Sabrina say “you guys look really good” and we turned around and SHE WAS THERE😭 we died dead

I CANT BELIEVE SHE SIGNED THE POLAROID!!! They said we’ll be getting more individual & group pics in a few weeks time!! (The pics taken on the professional camera!!)

They also dressed us up in satin PJs and robes that we could take home! And her makeup artist was there too to touch up our makeup!

Everyone had a moment with her privately and took individual pics with her! SHE HUGGED ME!!! She told me my name is beautiful and I’m beautiful😭😭 She told me to tell my family I said hi🥹

We did a Q&A!! My question got picked!!! I asked her what she’d be doing if it’s not music or acting and she said producing/director/casting director. And the Q&A was us sitting in the heart shape red thing she has at her concert, and we did spin the bottle to see who should ask the question like how she does her surprise songs😭

And then we drank espresso together with sabrina and sabrina did a cheers/toast with us😭 they also gave us a house tour shirt!!!

They also said 30 thousand people applied OMG and only 20 were selected

Some more answers from Q&A:

-she said the one color she’ll never wear on this tour is orange HAHAHA it’s the only color she hasn’t worn so far😭

-she said her fave bodysuit is the bodysuit she did with the NYC skyline and the OG pink body suit

-her current obsession is with Trader Joe’s and their seasonal products

-she was surprised when we said we loved Fast Times!!! She said NYC inspired Fast Times

-she said her favorite songs to perform on Tour are Taste, Good Graces and House Tour

-she said Espresso was inspired by her trip to France when she drank Espresso there and tied the song to how addictive and magnetic both coffee and women can be

-she said her fave comfort show is Sex and the City!!! And her fave comfort movie is How to Lose a Guy in 10 days!!!

-she said she lives in both NYC and LA but feels most at home when she’s with her friends and family

-she said when she performs don’t smile we should pay attention to the dancers cause they do wild shit like she caught one humping one of the poles😭

-she said it hasn’t hit her yet that the short n sweet tour is coming to an end and it usually hits her after the fact, and she said she’ll miss most the people she gets to spend time with everyday😭

40M here, running a small business. Nah, not a tech startup. 

Wondering if there are women out there, who are interested to just hangout, coffee, lunch/dinner. Discuss and share thoughts on general life, tech, politics, economy etc etc..

Well, am married and looking for platonic connections only. DM if interested.
