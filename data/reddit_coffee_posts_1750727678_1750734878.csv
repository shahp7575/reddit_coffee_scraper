There is a flower shop near me that I always get bombed by a ton of crap orders when I log on, usually 10am.  One morning one wasn't bad and I took it.  The lady complained when I showed up that she sets the deliveries for 11am, but drivers start showing at 10 and it irritates her.

Ohhhh so that's why her shop bombs me with offers in the morning....

So I asked a friend who works management at Walmart if that's what they do.  He said no but after thinking about it he answered why

Walmart sends people down isles to collect all items in that aisle for many orders.  In the back room everything gets separated and scanned in for the individual orders.  So they complete orders in batches, and the system is sending out pick up requests for all of them at the same time.

This morning I got a Walmart order and hit the coffee cup.  Moved farther away from it waited for it to ask if I was finished and wanted to go back online.  Didn't see another Walmart offer ",1,1750734565.0,UberEatsDrivers,1,1.0,False

I'm an artist and grad student living in Ravenswood with my partner and cat. We are childfree and moved here from Michigan 3 years ago. Despite people being nice, it's extremely hard to make genuine connections other than a few aquaintances. I'm looking for people who want real friendships- spending quality time together, providing emotional support, taking road trips together, etc. on a regular basis. I'm looking for people who actually have time to commit to platonic friendships (grabbing coffee once every 3 months is an acquaintanceship). I generally prefer to hang out with 1 or 2 people at a time over a group unless I know everyone. So about me, I'm neurodivergent, queer, Indigenous, Jewish and anti-zionist. Some of my hobbies include cooking and baking, going for nature walks, getting coffee, trying new restaurants, going to shows (a lot of emo, punk, metal, indie), seeing theatre performances, organizing, dancing, playing games, 420, really almost anything besides sports. I have social anxiety and it takes a minute for me to warm up to most people, but I think I'm fun and empathetic. If you are a kind person who cares about human rights, and are looking for an interesting, weird and caring friend to explore the city with and build community, feel free to reach out.

1lj0e6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UXDesign/comments/1lj0e6m/despite_everything_anyone_else_marvel_at_how/,"Despite everything, anyone else marvel at how central and wildly influential this role can be?","Hopecore rant incoming.

So I’ve got 6yoe, 3 as a product designer at a large bank. There was a long and tough time of learning regulations, mastering bureaucracy, and working my craft but it’s more relaxed now. My job is 80% new feature development and overhauls of legacy stuff.

I had an afternoon review today for a new feature I’m working on. I put on some coffee, good music, and basically went from nothing (paper sketches) to something very presentable (high-fi responsive prototype, multiple states, plans for research validation) in just a few hours. Showed the work to enthusiastic feedback and next steps with a group of PMs, tech leads, and principals. People were excited to see the ideas and genuinely debated on how to get it done the best way.

Isn’t that cool, the level of subtle influence that design has? at times, you are the only creative in the room and everyone is feeding off your work. Yeah, I’m surrounded by people that make much more than me and ostensibly have authority over me—product managers, engineering managers, executives—but I feel that I have an intangible leverage over their work that punches well above my weight.

To put it into perspective, the group I reviewed with is fairly large and serious. PMs from FAANG, software architects with 20+ YoE. The tech leads are all top H1B guys who brought their families to the US on the basis of working here, and spend their time managing people to build stuff… that I design alone in my apartment. And they listen to me? Trying not to have an ego about it and just be grateful.

Like, if I was just worse (or better) at my job—it ripples all the way through front end, back end, QA, customer support, legal, sales etc. All these people depend on the work. For that reason our leadership fights to keep me, a 26-year old art grad, happy and occupied.

Yeah, it was tough getting this job. Some things are still tough. But the fact that I can just put on coffee, jam out, and *not* want to die? That’s kind of the dream, maybe even the point of a career. I can kind of see why design jobs are so hard to secure. If there’s anyone out there looking, please hang in there and interview confidently with the idea that your work is so important to the business.

1lj063i,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1lj063i/my_last_cigarette/,My Last Cigarette,"I have been thinking for a long time about quitting it. So I guess today is the day. I still vaguely remember when I started it. It was in my hostel during my college days back in 2022. I was a bit drunk at that time still thinking why I started it honestly. I have come a long way, since then I have tried to stop it many times and then lapsed again. Over time it has sort of become a night routine for me. I have had thousands of cigarettes with my tea, coffee, cold drinks and alcohol. I have had it with my friends and alone when I was in a meloncaly. 

My mother has told me so many times to not smoke but I guess it didn't matter much to me. So you may ask why today. I don't know why, but today feels a good day to just leave. I am gonna have a haircut as well today. Something has changed but I can't put a finger on exactly what. 

I was talking to someone over an anonymous app, let's name her 'A'. She told me that I should stop it. I exactly remember the day, it was 16th june 2025 after 11pm. She said you know why pregnency rates are going down, it's because of men who involve themselves in such sedentary lifestyle and not just destroy their life but also the woman's and their upcoming child's lives as well. She also said if you think what you are doing is so good, then why not tell it to your parents. I actually have no answer to it, but I do think my parents know it. She is younger than me, but I way mature in thoughts, ""Jo Insaan khudse pyaar nhi kr skta, wo kisi aur se kabhi nhi kar payega"", ""agar sab kuch jaan ne ke baad bhi aap nhi sudhroge to aapka, aapse bada dushman koi nhi hai"". These lines stuck with me. I know I love myself more than my cigarette, I have to.

I don't have much money left in my bank account as well. Probably a few thousand rupees at max, and just enough money to make it through the next month. I am just broke at this point. I still try to be positive about the fact that I have food to eat but the dread of not having money is just killing me at this point. I just know that this is not what I want my life to be, but here we are. 

I think I was a good kid back then and honestly not much has changed now, it's just that being kind is not enough. I need to be competent to earn money. It has been more than 2 months now since I have a job. I ruined my last interview and there is nothing to look forward to. You might think why I am telling you this, the thing is I have been feeling judged by my family. They don't say it to my face but I know. Everyday when I talk to my mother, I just try to be positive as she is very possessive. I hate it most of the times honestly, I want to be sad. Like how can I pretend to be cheerful and positive when I know the reality is totally different. The only time I feel at ease is when I am having drag. 

The cigarette does not judge you, it just waits on your lips to be sucked in. I don't feel any hit as well, it's not as good as the first time as well. I don't know why, but I still feel at ease. Probably it's just that it is the only time when I am not thinking about anything else. But lately that feeling is going down as well. 

There was a time in my life when I used to listen to a lot of bollywood music, but with time the liking just vanished. Some of it can be blamed to the fact that bollywood is not making good music, but mostly it's just me, I don't connect it with anymore. I still remember there was a time, when before going to sleep I used to listen music on radio, this was long back around 2010-11. I used to pulg in my wired earphones on a nokia phone, one bus in my ear and the second in my father's. I don't know why I never liked that, probably because for me music is very intimate thing which I like to do it alone. 

I still do listen to music, but my prefrances have changed. I am more into hip hop now. Not as much into international, I prefer DHH. But lately that feeling is also fading. What I am trying to convey is that there is a time for things to come and go in your life, and there is no point in clinging to those things. Likings change with time and that's fine. But before leaving it completely I want to have it one last time, just for reminiscing. Just for that one last time, because I know there is no going back from this. 

If I remember correctly my first cigarette was Marlboro advanced. And my last Cigarette will be Marlboro Classic Regular. I think that with time your preference for cigarettes changes as well. Right now my favourite is the new Editions cigarette, I like it's flavour so very much, it's the best tasting cigarette that I had by a long margin. Then there is indie mint, for a long time I didn't try it as people told men don't smoke indie mint. But I like it, I think after advance it is my most smoked cigarette. 

I was also very interested in lighters. My first lighter was simple nothing special. It was transparent blue/violet which you can find in any nearby kirana shop. My second lighter was a gas lighter, utility wise they are the best, as the speed of wind does not affect the fire. It's hard to explain, but I never liked these gas lighters as they light the cigarette in one go. There is something about using match sticks or a normal lighter, it takes more effort it feels worth it. 

\-------------------------------------------------;

I just had my last Cigarette with tea. It's 7.50am right now in Gurgaon. It just started to rain as well while I was smoking. It should mean something right, I want it to mean something. I listened two songs as well. One by Jagjit Singh, Tujhko dariya Dil ki Kasam and other by Talha Anjum, downers at dusk. Downers at dusk is my most streamed song in last two years since it came out in Feb 2023. I like that song very much. It has helped me so much during my tough times, and it makes so much sense to listen to it while I am smoking my last. I think it deserves this.

I was also thinking about how I smoked a cigarette. I like to hold it in my left hand, it looks much more aesthetic. My friend likes to hold it using his thumb and index finger, I think he learned this from peaky blinders. I hold it between my index and middle finger. 

It made me a bit emotional while I was throwing the bud and the lighter. I wanted to hold it for a bit longer, but it's time to let it go now. I feel at ease now. I can move on now. I gave my cigarette the best farewell, smoking it in the balcony while it's raining and my favourite song in my ears. I don't know what else I could have done. Probably enjoy it more, but I don't really feel anything right now. 

I smoked my first at night when I was high, and I smoked my last in broad day light in my full senses. In a way I started at night and I smoked till morning, and now it's time to move on. It is a new day and I have to do a lot more.",2,1750733812.0,india,0,1.0,False

Welcome to 'Tude Talk Tuesday, where you're invited to share what changes you've noticed in your attitudes and perspectives since you've gotten sober.

I once heard someone say ""A grateful person will never drink"" and that resonated with me.

When I was drinking, I found that hardly anything was ever good enough, people rarely met my expectations or requirements, and I was just unhappy with the world.  The only way I knew how to escape this awful place was to drink.

In sobriety, I came to understand that I needed to appreciate the world around me or I would want to escape back into the bottle.  Part of what helped me was practicing gratitude, and I do mean _practicing_.  To me it seems to be like any other kind of muscle -- the more I practice gratitude, the better I get with it and the more powerful it feels.  My appreciating the world around me, from the little things like a warm cup of coffee, to the big things like the fact that I'm sober one more day, it helps me want to stay in the world rather than escape it.

So how about you?  How has your appreciation for the world changed in sobriety?",2,1750733670.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Because… this wasn’t a written blog, or a private caption. It was a 10-slide aesthetic reel set to Count Basie, intercut with moody clips of her folding laundry and making pour-over coffee while describing deeply traumatic abuse in centered white font.
It was giving “clean girl confessional meets cinematic trauma arc” and I’m not sure the vibe matched the subject matter??

Some thoughts:

She clearly went through something horrific, and deserves healing—but is Instagram the space for this kind of story in this kind of format?

Why mix trauma narration with soft lighting, curated outfits, and shots of her chic kitchen backsplash?

Ending the post with “and that’s when I met my husband” was… a transition.

Comments are full of “so brave queen” and not one person seems to question the packaging?


Again, this isn’t about gatekeeping trauma expression. But influencers making content out of it? It starts to feel like pain is just another part of the personal brand😬 And that feels… icky.

Would love to know how y’all feel. Empowering? Exploitive? Just poor taste?

1lizzou,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1lizzou/the_thing_that_cried_human_part_2_of_2/,The Thing That Cried Human [PART 2 OF 2],"Part VI:  

The first light of dawn crept over the treetops, cold and colorless, casting a pale haze through the smoke-hung clearing. No one had slept.  

They hadn't even tried. 

Ashes still curled from the fire pit, long since gone cold, and the three of them sat scattered around it-silent, slumped, hollow-eyed. No one spoke. No one moved. Ben's face was drawn, his eyes red-rimmed, locked on the tree line like he expected it to step forward and speak. Liz clutched her jacket tighter around her body despite the summer air. Cass's leg jittered with nervous energy, tapping a rhythm that frayed everyone's nerves.  

Every crack of branches in the woods made them flinch. Every gust of wind through the needles drew darting glances.  

The screams had stopped hours ago. 

But the silence was worse. 

Somewhere out there, whatever wore Evan's voice-whatever taunted them with it-was still waiting.  

Still watching. 

Still close.  

""We need to move,"" Liz said hoarsely, breaking the stillness. Her voice sounded like gravel.  

""We can't stay here another night."" 

No one argued. 

But no one stood up either. 

Because deep in their bones, they all felt it.  

Last night had cracked something open.  

The sound of the forest seemed louder now. Every rustle of leaves, every groan of a shifting tree, pressed down on them like the pressure of a deep ocean. Liz stood at the edge of the clearing, her arms wrapped tight around herself, eyes searching the thinning trees where Riley had vanished.  

Ben broke the silence, his voice low but steady. ""We have to decide. Now. Do we look for Riley... or go back to base?""  

No one spoke at first.  

Liz's eyes were fixed on the tree line. ""If he's out there... alone, injured... we can't just walk away."" 

""But we don't even know where he went,"" Cass argued. ""He could be anywhere. You heard those things last night. He might've-"" 

""Stop,"" Liz cut her off. 

Ben exhaled sharply through his nose and crouched, drawing a quick map in the dirt with a stick. ""We know he ran northeast. The slope he went toward is steep-he wouldn't have made it far if he slipped or twisted anything.""  

He looked up, meeting their eyes. ""We check the ridge. One hour. We stay together. If we find nothing by then... we head back to base."" 

Liz nodded, though her hands trembled as she zipped up her jacket. ""One hour,"" she echoed. 

Cass stood up, slung her backpack over her shoulder ""We should go now then, before we change our minds.""  

The group moved out, boots crunching over pine needles, the forest rising around them like a cathedral of silence. The deeper they went, the heavier the air became-suffocating, thick with a damp, earthy rot.  

Fifty minutes in, the trail ended. There were broken branches-signs of something having passed through. No blood. No clothing. No Riley. 

""Time's almost up,"" Liz said, her voice hollow. 

""Wait,"" Ben said suddenly, stepping forward. 

""There-on that tree."" 

A strip of fabric. 

Faded red. Torn and stuck to a low branch, stiff with something dark and dried.  

Liz pulled it free. Her voice barely escaping her throat. ""It's from his hoodie.""  

Ben turned slowly in a circle, eyes narrowing.  

From somewhere behind them, too far to see but too close to ignore, came a sound of a branch cracking.  

Not underfoot. 

Snapping. 

Followed by silence. 

Then... a soft, wet sound-like something dragging. 

Cass took a step back. ""What hell was that?"" 

Ben, fixed on the tree line, froze.  

Beyond the first wall of trees-thirty feet out- stood a figure. 

Still. 

Pale. 

Naked. 

Facing away from them. 

It was Riley. 

Or... it looked like Riley. 

He stood with his back to them, feet sunk into the old mud, his bare shoulders twitching in sharp, unnatural jolts. Not shivering, but twitching. Like a puppet fighting against invisible strings. His head lolled slightly to one side, like it had been unhinged, held upright by little more than muscle memory.  

""Riley?"" Liz called out before she could stop herself. 

No response. 

Just that strange, staccato movement. His limbs jerked subtly-shoulders, spine, knees-like something inside him was trying to figure out how to wear a human body. The air around him seemed wrong. Denser somehow. Too still.  

Then Riley's head twitched.  

Once. 

Twice. 

And snapped halfway around, just shy of a full turn. A low groan reverberated through the trees. Not from him, but from somewhere just behind where he stood.  

Suddenly, Riley dropped onto all fours with a sickening crack of bone. 

His joints bent the wrong way-elbows jutting out, knees twisting backward-as his body contorted into something inhuman. 

Then without a word, he skittered into the woods. His limbs jerking wildly.  

 Cass screamed, her hands flying to her mouth.  

""Did-did you see his face? It wasn't Riley, I-it couldn't have been!"" 

Liz backed away slowly, her eyes wide, mouth trembling. ""That sound-his bones-oh my god, what the hell happened to him?"" 

Another sharp crack echoed from deeper in the trees-Riley, or the thing that had once been Riley, moving fast and low through the brush.  

""Run,"" Ben breathed, voice barely audible. 

""Run!"" 

Cass didn't need to be told twice. She turned and bolted, her boots pounding against the earth. Liz was right behind her. Grabbing Ben's sleeve and dragging him as another sickening howl echoed from the forest. It wasn't quite human; it wasn't quite animal. 

The three of them tore down the narrow trail they'd come from earlier, branches clawing at their faces and gear, adrenaline drowning out the burn in their legs and lungs. Behind them, somewhere in the maze of trees, twigs cracked in rhythm.  

It was following. 

Ben dared a glance over his shoulder-and instantly regretted it.  

A pale shape darted between trees, far too fast and too low to the ground. For a split second, it looked like Riley's face grinning at him upside down-wide-eyed, twisted, impossibly stretched.  

 Ben skidded to a halt. Mud kicking up as he stopped, drew his .44 from his holster, and aimed it to the trees behind them.  

""Ben!"" Cass shouted, jerking to a stop ahead. 

""What the hell are you doing? MOVE!"" 

""We can't outrun it,"" Ben said, voice tight but calm. ""Not all of us."" 

Liz's eyes widened as she ran back toward him. ""Don't do this. Come on-don't be stupid."" 

He glanced at her. ""I'm not. I'm buying you time."" 

Liz opened her mouth to protest, but something in Ben's face stopped her. She swallowed, her eyes shining. ""You better make it back. You hear me?"" 

Ben nodded, jaw clenched. ""Get out of here, get help."" 

Liz’s breath hitched. She grabbed his arm for a second-just a second-then let go. 

Cass with her eyes beginning to fill with tears, ""I better see you again Ben."" 

Ben smirked; eyes locked on hers.  

""I'll see you soon."" 

Then, Cass and Liz took off. Their footsteps fading into the forest. 

Ben stood alone. 

Breathing calm. 

Pistol steady. 

The forest held its breath. 

Five shots cracked through the silence, each one ringing like a bell of defiance. 

Then came the scream-raw, broken, painful. 

Then nothing. 

  

Part VII:   

Cass and Liz tore through the forest like hunted animals, the breath burning in their lungs and thorns clawing at their arms. The trees blurred past in streaks of green and shadow, but neither dared stop. Not after what they'd seen. Not with that thing wearing Riley's face still smiling in their mind. 

Branches snapped beneath their feet. Roots reached like fingers to trip them, but adrenaline kept them upright. A single thought propelled them forward: Keep going, don't look back. 

They didn't speak. There was no time. Only the sound of wind, the sharp rush of footfalls over wet earth, and the scream in their hearts pounding like war drums in their chests.  

It wasn't until they broke through the thicket that the world seemed to tilt sideways.  

Cass stumbled first, skidding to a stop. Liz nearly collided with her, gasping and bent over, hands on her knees.  

They had returned.  

The clearing. 

The grove. 

All around them, the trees loomed tall and solemn, draped in bone windchimes that had long since stopped swinging. The remains of those who'd vanished over the decades clacked softly in the breeze-tiny taps like knuckles on glass. Animal skulls stared from the branches. Ribcages curled like cages from the canopy above. 

But now there was something new. 

At the center of the grove stood a wooden post, sharpened to a crude spike. And strung across it, arms out like a grotesque scarecrow, was a skinned human body. 

Raw, pink, dripping. 

The head was gone. 

Strips of flesh flapped in the wind like flags of meat. 

Cass fell to her knees with a strangled cry, covering her mouth. Liz didn't move. She stared, wide-eyed, until the world narrowed to a pinpoint and the silence swelled with nausea and static. 

The body had no face. But the shape, the stature, 

It was Riley. 

The real Riley. 

Liz's legs gave out. She sat back hard on the earth, the impact rattling up her spine. Cass crawled toward her and grabbed her wrist with trembling fingers. 

""This... this can't be real,"" Cass trembled. ""What are they? What is this place?"" 

Liz sat frozen, her breath shallow and uneven. The wind had died completely-so sudden, so complete it felt like the world itself had stopped breathing. 

The bones above them-strung between the trees like trophies-gave a final rattle and stilled.  

Cass, sobbing at this point, finally broke. 

Cass let out a cry, clutching at her scalp as if trying to claw the thoughts out of her head.  

""They watched us, waited for us. This place-this hell-it doesn't want us to leave."" 

Her cries turned into laughter. High, broken, the sound of a mind coming apart at the seams. ""We thought we could search. Rescue. Like we mattered. But they were playing with us... like they did with Evan..."" 

There was movement in the trees.  

Liz snapped her head towards the noise. 

There, standing in the clearing, was Riley, covered in blood. 

Smiling. 

Liz jolted up, terrified. 

""Cass... we need to move. Cass!"" 

Liz reached for Cass, but Cass flinched away, her body trembling violently. She rocked back and forth on the cold earth, laughter spilling out of her like a cracked music box. ""We're not going home. We're not going anywhere. We're already gone."" 

Liz stumbled backward, her breath catching in her throat.  

Riley stepped closer 

Liz's eyes locked on Riley, heart pounding. 

Behind him, appeared a figure. 

The thing stood tall, its limbs too long and too thin, as if someone had stretched a human form like wet leather over a deer's frame. Its skin was the color of old ash. Dry, cracked, and clinging too tightly to the bone beneath. But it was the eyes that stopped everything: not glowing, not reflective-just pits of endless black. No iris, no white.  

Just void. 

Then, as if sensing Liz's gaze, the thing twitched-its neck cracking as it turned toward her. And with a sound like fabric tearing, a split opened across its face. Where a mouth should be, flesh peeled back in a ragged, unnatural smile, revealing rows of uneven, needle-sharp teeth embedded in raw twitching muscle. 

Then it spoke. 

Broken, its tone fluctuating high and low, until it finally matched the pitch of Cass's cries. 

""We... search... mattered... buut they were pllaa-"" Then suddenly, its voice changed.  

It sounded exactly like Cass.  

speaking perfectly, ""they were playing with us... like they did with Evan."" 

""Cass, please,"" Liz pleaded, begging her to come to her senses.  

Cass just laughed harder, curling herself like a child hiding from a monster under the bed. 

The thing moved even closer. 

Liz backed away slowly, one hand fumbling behind her for anything-her pack, a flashlight, anything. Her foot hit a rock, and she nearly fell, catching herself just in time. She didn't dare take her eyes of the horrifying sight of the thing. 

""CASS!""  

Suddenly, Cass snapped out of her psychoses.  

The world became utterly silent. 

Then, came a subtle whisper, right next to Cass's ear. 

""I'll see you soon."" 

Cass, overtaken by shock, slowly turned. 

There, inches from her face, 

Was Ben. 

Smiling. 

 

Part VII: 

Cass didn't even have time to scream. 

The thing wearing Ben's face-moved with impossible speed. One moment he was inches from her face, the next his hand was around her throat, lifting her effortlessly off the ground like she weighed nothing. 

His eyes were wrong. 

Too black, deep and ancient. 

Cass kicked and clawed at his arm, nails raking down the pale, cold skin. It felt like trying to scratch stone. 

Ben tilted his head. That same, terrible smile never left his face. 

And then, he began to peel. 

He reached up with his free hand, and dug fingers into Cass's jawline, and started downward. 

Her scream finally found its way out. 

Raw and ragged, as flesh came free in strips. 

Blood sprayed across the trees like ink. Her body convulsed violently in his grip as layers of skin were torn from her like tissue paper. Her face was locked in a grotesque mask of agony, mouth open, eyes rolling back. 

With a final jerk, the thing snapped her neck. 

The sound echoed through the woods like a gunshot. 

Cass's lifeless, ruined body crumpled to the ground.  

Liz couldn't move.  

Her legs wouldn't work. 

Then a fourth creature emerged from behind Ben. 

Looking directly at her. 

Liz finally had gotten herself to move. 

Branches clawed at her arms and face as she pushed through the underbrush. Her lungs burned. Her vision blurred. But she didn't dare stop. The forest blurred around her - every tree identical to the next, every path looping back into itself. The forest felt alive, pulsing with breath, watching her from all sides. 

She spun around - no landmarks, no trail.  

Just woods. 

Endless, shifting woods. 

Every direction looked the same. 

And behind her, far off, came the sound of cracking joints and wet footsteps. 

She took off in a blind sprint, crashing through bushes with no real direction- just away.  

Her breath tore ragged from her throat, heart pounding so loud it nearly drowned out everything. Branches slicing her skin, but she didn't stop.  

She couldn't stop. 

She needed to hide. Somewhere, anywhere. 

But there was nothing. 

No hollowed tree, no outcrop, no boulder to duck behind. Just endless black forest swallowing the amber sunlight and stretching in every direction. 

She stumbled on roots and caught herself on a sapling, her legs trembling. Still, she ran. 

Then, the ground vanished. 

She skidded to a halt just feet from the edge of a cliff, a sheer drop yawning before her. The wind rushed up from the cliffside below, cool and endless. 

Chest heaving, she looked behind her.  

Nothing. 

But it was coming.  

It always came. 

Her fingers fumbled at her jacket pocket. She had forgotten completely about the camcorder, the one from Evan's campsite. She turned it on with shaking hands, the tiny red recording light blinking to life.  

""I am Liz Gray"" she said, voice quaking. 

""If anyone finds this... for the love of god, turn back."" 

Sounds cracked behind her, scratching of trees, and heavy footsteps. 

She looked directly into the lens now, wide-eyed, and desperate. 

""It wears you,"" she said. ""I saw it tear one of my partners to shreds, and it copied her voice as she screamed."" 

The noises behind her getting closer. 

""It isn't me."" 

She shut off the camcorder. 

Shaking, she said, ""I'm not dying like this, not to those things."" 

Her heels kissed the drop. She looked down, the fall was far. Maybe far enough, maybe not. She clenched her fists. Gritted her teeth. She took one last breath and jumped. 

The wind calmed, and time slowed. 

......................................................................... 

But the fall never came. 

The thing had caught Liz over the cliff by her hair. 

She felt her scalp tearing, her hair ripping, and her screams tore through the entire forest. With its free hand, with blinking speed, it smashed it into Liz's throat, crushing her windpipe, completely silencing her. 

With Liz fighting its grip, it brought her within inches of its face, and it spoke, it sounded as if Liz was talking to herself. 

The words echoing back into her mind,  

""We're here to rescue someone. Not to entertain campfire stories."" 

Her eyes widened, the pain in her throat stinging as she feels blood filling her mouth. 

She had said it with conviction that first morning at base camp, standing across from Ben, Cass, and Riley. Her arms crossed tight like a shield. She'd meant it, to stay sharp, grounded in facts. But now, face to face with this thing, she realized, they were dead the moment they stepped into the forest. It had been waiting for them to come find Evan. They were being watched from the beginning.  

The thing held tight around Liz's throat still, and with its other hand, it raised it to Liz's forehead, 

And started peeling. 

Part IX:  

TWO WEEKS LATER 

 The early morning sun cast long, slanted shadows through the mist creeping low across the forest floor. The hum of generators and the smell of reheated coffee hung in the air as a new team gathered at the base camp-an upgraded version of the one Liz had commanded. More personnel, more equipment, and more urgency. 

No one had heard a word from the original search party. 

They were now missing along with Evan. 

No sign of Evan, Liz, Ben, Cass, or Riley. It was as if the woods had opened their mouth and swallowed them whole. 

This time, the state had stepped in. Uniformed forest service officers stood alongside local search and rescue volunteers. The command tent buzzed with tension that hung heavier than the clouds above. 

Captain Jonas Keene, mid-40s, hard-set jaw and tired eyes, stood at the front of the group. A man who'd done tours overseas and wildfires out west. This was just a search they told him. People get lost. But no one wanted to say out loud what they really believed. 

""This is a rescue mission,"" Keene said, voice firm as he held up a map of the restricted zone. ""They've been out of contact for two weeks, they should've been back by now, but that doesn't mean they're gone. Terrain's rough, weather turned on 'em. Maybe they're injured. Maybe they're holed up somewhere waiting."" 

No one responded.  

Keene ran a finger along a winding trail. ""We spread out in grids. Two-man teams. Radios on, no wandering. We keep to daylight, and we mark everything. Got it?"" 

Heads nodded. 

Near the back stood Marcus Shaw, a former firefighter turned search and rescue, who'd seen his share of twisted ankles and missing hikers-but nothing like this. Not five people vanishing without a trace. No emergency beacons. No GPS signals. Just silence.  

Keene's voice cut through the silence. ""Let's move. We've got light for another ten hours. First checkpoint is the ridge that enters the restricted zone. No heroics. No solo ventures. Stay sharp and stay loud. Here is a picture of all the missing persons we are trying to find. Keep them with you. If you find one, radio in.” 

There was the rustle of packs and crunch of boots as the teams began to move toward the tree line. The wind dropped as they entered the woods. The air shifted. Cooler. Denser. Sound seemed to fade beneath the canopy, swallowed by pine and shadows. 

As the group rounded a bend in the narrow path, someone stood ahead- still and waiting.  

There stood Liz.

The sliding glass door that leads out to your veranda provides me with all the sights I need to see to keep me fulfilled. 



You get up every morning to start your day at six with a workout. You’re punctual. I like that.



Your beautiful muscles stretch and strain, fighting against your body weight for their fibers to break themselves down and repair them once more, continuing the cycle to make yourself stronger and better. Your persistence is admirable and your stamina is unmatchable. 



You fix yourself breakfast after you shower, tossing back freshly blow-dried brunette hair after a short shower. Soft, kissable lips sip iced coffee laced with protein powder as your luscious green eyes devour a psychology textbook, your glittery purple pen jotting down a copious amount of notes. I slip a little whiskey into my coffee and add the same amount of sugar. One day, I’ll take you for coffee. 



Just the two of us.



Your textbook plops closed after exactly fifteen minutes. Someone’s cramming for an exam they forgot to study for. You review notes and crack open your MacBook, typing away as the minutes tick by. You cheer to yourself, your little practice quiz going better than you expected, clearly. 



Your professor’s a fucking asshole. 



I know this because we both have the same psychology class. You sit in your same seat in the front row as he critiques an ‘anonymous’ student’s essay after the exam and holds nothing back. He trashes your arguments and criticizes your choice of sources, calling them ‘outdated’ and ‘invalid’. Some of the students whisper to another and wonder who would have written an essay like that. 



I can see you sink into your seat and it makes me sad for you. Assholes like that never recognize hard work and pure effort. My folks always said to me growing up that true grit was what counted in life, if you were making an effort, you were doing better than those that never made an attempt at all. 



You’re understandably a mess after psychology, returning to your apartment and tossing your knapsack onto the wooden floor, the contents spilling out haphazardly. You slip into an oversized All Time Low shirt and crank up the music, tossing yourself onto your bed, quiet sobs forcing their way out of you, eyeliner laced tears stain your pillow case. I wish I could lay next to you and have you let it all out onto my shoulder. 



Your cell phone rings. It’s Friday night and your friends want you to come out tonight.



You sniffle, and after a bit of consideration, you accept. 



…



For someone that makes as much money as he does, the professor knows not to make himself stand out. It’s smart, really, when you consider all the muggings that have been popping up as of late. 



He doesn’t hear the crunch of gravel underneath my work boots as I cross under the streetlight, my prized skinning knife from my farm boy days clutched tightly in my right palm. He has no idea what is coming, no semblance of the slightest warning as he curses to himself, wondering why his car won’t start. Putting sugar in his gas tank was a classic move. Making friends with the kids that went to juvie in high school really taught me some valuable tricks. 



He impatiently dials AAA, stepping out of his car into the cool autumn weather. I can still remember seeing him ask you to stay after classes ended for the day and the look on your face when he’d initially displayed your essay. You looked so sad. It broke my heart.



A couple of stabs into his kidneys is all it takes to take down the prehistoric fuck. He crumples like paper, screaming and begging for his life as I dig both his eyes out. 



His criticizing tongue sits loosely in my gloved hands, blood soaking my tried and true worn blue jeans and my green army jacket. The slab of muscle is slimy and wet, like a really thick slug as he rasps and rattles on the floor, odd sobs interrupting in awkward intervals that sound more like guttural wails. 



Looks like all those hunting trips paid off. 



…



Your four girlfriends hug and kiss you, all dressed up in their Baby Phat, Juicy Couture, and Von Dutch get-ups, you apologize to them for being late as they do so.



 The white bandana tube top that teases your well-muscled figure is revealed as you slip off your prized Harley Davidson leather jacket and toss it on the back of your chair, black jeans cling to your long legs and are complemented with high-heeled leather boots. 



You chit and chatter with them about how everything is going: your classes, your job at the real estate firm, your assignments and projects. They ask about your dad, how’s he doing, where has he been, yadda yadda. You mention his birthday is next week.



Noted. I should buy the man a gift. 



These girls don’t suit you. They’re boring, wastes of time. They look like they suck the energy out of you, with the way they egg you on and push you to drink with them. You cave to their peer pressure and order a rum and coke. They all down their drinks in record time to get up and dance to some Sean Kingston song. 



At least you’re enjoying yourself. I’d never fault you for that at all.



Trouble comes in the form of a jockish football playing-type approaching you from behind on the dancefloor. He makes a slightly drunken attempt at flirting with half-assed pickup lines that you laugh off and politely tell him you’re not interested. Your friends flash their little hand signals popular with the club going types eager to avoid lecherous, drunken men. 



You give them the thumbs up after the man fucks off in search of easier prey. You excuse yourself to the bathroom after your second rum and coke, your friends discussing the latest gossip about the job and how they all thought it shameful for our psych professor to tear apart your essay like that. 



But you won’t have to worry about him anymore. 



When you come back, you look exhausted and worn out. Someone’s social battery is drained. You bid your friends goodbye and they offer to see you out and wait with you for the cab. You decline and tell them you’ll call them as soon as you get in. 



Stepping out into the pale moonlight, you call up a cab and pop a Tylenol after rifling through your purse, muttering about how maybe tonight wasn’t the right night for rum and coke. The jock who approached you on the dancefloor tries his luck again after he extinguishes a cigarette.



He pelts you with pet names and offers to keep you company, because ‘a girl like you shouldn’t be out alone’. You decline as he blows cigarette smoke in your direction, his face shifting into an offended expression with undertones of anger. 



You won’t give him a chance, he says. Your eyes narrow and tell him that he had no chance to begin with. He won’t take no for an answer. 



He tries to grab at your arm and stop you from leaving. He’s a nice guy, he says. He isn’t like the creepozoids inside that’ll love her and leave her. You tell him he’s obviously had too much to drink. 



He doesn’t like that, his teeth gritting and his hand snatching at your wrist. 



Your jab hits him square in the nose when he successfully manages to pull you toward him. You hit him again in the sternum and follow-up with an overhand right, your blows sobering him right up. 



Your cab pulls up. You hop in. Amazing work, but I’ll take it from here, my dear. 



He calls you all sortsa names as he saunters and staggers his way back to the side entrance of the club, muttering to himself about how badly he needs to piss.



The first couple of times he took me hunting, dear old dad wanted me to master the basics of hunting and killing small game. The majority of hunting is a waiting game, a test of patience in detecting the right moment to pounce upon your prey. Oftentimes, I’d find myself purposefully injuring the animals in order to be ‘forced’ to put them out of their misery. 



A small flick of the wrist is typically all it takes to snap the necks of bobwhites and American woodcocks. Dove heads pop off like the bottle caps of those Mexican cokes. You stood on the necks of turkeys to kill those annoying fuckers. Birds were always delicately fragile things, easy to capture and rewarding to break. 



It was loads of fun to watch squirrels fight me tooth and nail as I drowned them in the river, their bodies squirming, writhing, and struggling for the slightest chance to get away from me. Only one of them ever got to escape from me, when my hand slipped and he bit me, leaping out of the water and scrambling away before I could pop it in the skull. 



Other times, you could barely hear the snap of their spine break after I swung them by the tail into a nearby tree, but it's always so hard to gut and clean ‘em when they’re a bloody paste. It also creates suspicion that requires unnecessary work and effort to cover up. 



Slitting throats is efficient, but every time I slit the throat of an animal, it puts their self- preservation instinct into overdrive, rabbits especially. Those little shits would be biting, kicking, and screaming until it was all over and I’d be left with scratches up and down my wrists. I found that every time I finished off an animal myself that it always tasted ten times better when dad and I got to cooking.



I slip into the bathroom, unwrapping one of the medium-sized blue garbage bags that I keep in my apartment. He doesn’t hear the click of the deadbolt, the loud sound of his urine blocking out any slight sound I make. I slowly unravel the plastic bag as I slide against the stalls. 



The bag makes its way over his head and around his face as I apply a rear-naked choke. An elbow frees him from my grasp. A quick jab to his throat is all I need to put the fight to a screeching halt after I dodge a couple of hastily thrown swings. I slip the bag over his head, slamming my knee into his ribcage as hard as I can. 



Drunks never put up a good fight. 



His face meets the toilet, nostalgia floods my veins as he futilely thrashes and struggles against my grip, both hands pushing down on his head, his torso area in between my legs. The squirrel goes slack, hands limp at his sides and head bobbing like an apple.



You miss the newscast that covers his murder. 



He won’t be missed.



…



Your girlfriends ambush you at your apartment, looking to surprise you with a gift as an apology for not being able to take you out to a birthday dinner last Friday. I mark my calendar as I sit in my car with my binoculars.



Classes have been postponed since they discovered both bodies. They’ve put a curfew in effect. The papers speak of a possible serial killer. 



If only they knew.



From what I can see, it’s something long inside a big box with black and white wrapping paper, the Hallmark type. You slice it open with the small knife you carry on your keys next to your pepper spray, greedily clutching what I almost mistake for a rifle. Maybe that would be a good gift for you, we could go hunting together. 



You’d love it. 



It’s a telescope. You’ve always wanted one—a real one, that is. Not the ones sold in Toys R Us to little kids that will inevitably sit in a dusty attic to waste away and be forgotten about. They help you set it up, adjust the lens, and you look to the sky in amazement.



They give you another gift: a notebook to track the constellations in the sky. You hug them, ever so grateful for having met them, tears in your eyes and all. 



Maybe I should get you a gift. One to make you forget all about that telescope. 



…



You peer through your telescope and gasp at the stars in the sky, constellations painting the beautiful abyss of black, like a mass of glitter. 



You scribble this one and that down in your notebook, this time with a black glitter pen that matches the sky. I sip on another coffee to keep me awake after I get a good workout in and order some food. You’re really getting me into some bad habits.

I just want to make this post to get some facts straight about the development of the project and the ability of people to be heard in regards to this project: for and against, without even delving into the arguments actually made so much.

On April 2, DOT gave a presentation to the CB1 Queens Transportation Committee concerning the 31st St redesign: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRi56GhcdE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzRi56GhcdE)

April 2 Committee Agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-REVISED-Transportation-memo-Agenda-31-F-04\_02.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-REVISED-Transportation-memo-Agenda-31-F-04_02.pdf)

The proposed redesign: [https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-apr2025.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-apr2025.pdf)

On April 7, a petition was created calling for rejection of the redesign: [https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-plan-in-astoria](https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-plan-in-astoria) (currently \~4.2k signatures)

On April 13, a petition was created calling for support of the redesign: [https://www.change.org/p/bring-safety-improvements-to-31st-street-in-astoria](https://www.change.org/p/bring-safety-improvements-to-31st-street-in-astoria) (currently \~3.4k signatures)

On April 14, the 31st Street Business Association held a press conference on the SW corner of 31st St & 31st Ave.: [https://astoriapost.com/astoria-residents-business-owners-rally-against-proposed-bike-lane-on-31st-street](https://astoriapost.com/astoria-residents-business-owners-rally-against-proposed-bike-lane-on-31st-street)

The organization was joined by Assembly Member Jennifer Rajkumar who represents Assembly District 38, which includes parts of Glendale, Ridgewood, Woodhaven, and Ozone Park.

On April 15, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzqb\_I9vJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTzqb_I9vJM)

The redesign was not part of the agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-April-Memo-Agenda-L-04\_15.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-April-Memo-Agenda-L-04_15.pdf)

Board members were to not yet consider the proposal, let alone vote on it. The President of the 31st Street Business association began the public comment section. A former candidate in the Democratic primary for District 59 of the New York State Senate also spoke shortly after. Representatives of the following businesses had an opportunity to speak: King Souvlaki, ZA & D Service Station, Astoria Central Parking, Under Pressure Coffee, and Pilates Designs. The last representative mentioned he had met with three DOT officials earlier that same day. A couple of parents/residents also spoke not in favor of the project.

Parents and residents of Astoria would each have a chance to speak in favor of the project (about seven or so total).

On May 20, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9iutBX22lA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9iutBX22lA)

The redesign was not part of the agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-May-Memo-Agenda-revised-L-05\_20.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-May-Memo-Agenda-revised-L-05_20.pdf)

During comment for the Item #1: IKOS Rezoning for Senior Living Facility at 32-07 31st Street, the President of the 31st Business Association interjected concerns about travel for seniors as it relates to the 31st Street redesign. He ended by expressing disappointment that during the last monthly meeting public comment was cut to only ninety seconds per person.

During public comment, a gentleman spoke out against the redesign. Born in Astoria, he claims to have never once had a dangerous run-in with cars as a pedestrian or bike rider in Astoria. He would go on to make an analogy about how chickens in a rural area are able to cross a road without traffic lights, signs, or barriers so we should expect careful, thoughtful people to be able to do the same in Astoria.

A woman would later also speak out against the 31st St redesign as well as the 31st Ave redesign.

On June 13, thirteen additional businesses announced they would join the petition against the DOT proposal: [https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-proposal-in-astoria/u/33616881](https://www.change.org/p/reject-the-31st-street-dot-proposal-in-astoria/u/33616881)

Also on June 13, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, Assembly Member Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, and Council Member Tiffany Caban stated their support of the resdesign: [https://astoriapost.com/lawmakers-back-dot-31st-street-bike-lane-redesign](https://astoriapost.com/lawmakers-back-dot-31st-street-bike-lane-redesign)

On June 17, CB1 Queens held their monthly meeting: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRPtnLOnnY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhRPtnLOnnY)

A presentation by DOT about the redesign became a later addition to the original agenda: [https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-June-Memo-Agenda-06\_17-Revised.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/queenscb1/downloads/pdf/2025/2025-Full-Board-June-Memo-Agenda-06_17-Revised.pdf)

The presentation slides: [https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-jun2025.pdf](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/31-st-36-ave-newtown-ave-jun2025.pdf)

I highly recommend viewing and hearing the public comment section with much greater clarity here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOPA27wr\_80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOPA27wr_80)

Throughout all public comment sections, a balance of speakers for and against was always sought. During each public comment, instruction was always given that written comment could be submitted to the board for consideration as public comment is normally limited to two minutes: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/frequently-asked-questions.page#faq06](https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/frequently-asked-questions.page#faq06)

CB1 normally wraps up and needs to leave the space by 10 PM, which is around the time DOT officials had finished their presentation and fielded questions from board members. They were continuously delayed by yelling and interruption from people against the proposal. Time was allowed for public comment, however, before CB1 even began the segment of the agenda to hold a couple of votes and conduct their internal business.

I just want to make a few observations about this most recent meeting:

1) As the DOT presentation about the redesign was about to start, opponents of the plan swarmed behind the podium to coordinate holding up signs in opposition. Camera crews and reporters from PIX11 and CBS New York were in attendance to specifically film this section and interview participants about it (kudos to them for staying so late):

[https://pix11.com/video/astoria-businesses-clash-over-proposed-bike-lane-safety-plan/10812371/](https://pix11.com/video/astoria-businesses-clash-over-proposed-bike-lane-safety-plan/10812371/)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwegygtTJhs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwegygtTJhs)

2) To again create a balance of opinion while already running late and against the clock, the chair directed that four people would be able to first speak against the plan and then four could speak in support. The chair also made note that some opponents have already had time to speak at either an earlier meeting or with DOT so perhaps others who have not been heard should speak. Despite this, four members of the 31st Street Business Association read a press statement using up all of the allotted time for speakers against the project. Written statements can be submitted here: [https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/contact.page](https://www.nyc.gov/site/queenscb1/about/contact.page)

3) The President of the 31st Street Business Association included a remark: ""Despite our demand to be heard as a collective, \[DOT\] repeatedly tried to pick us off one-by-one."" For one, getting one-on-one meetings with DOT officials would allow business owners to address their specific concerns. And two, based on the conduct at this meeting, it's not hard to imagine why government employees would seek to address specific concerns with individual businesses rather than address all of the businesses at once.",11,1750732544.0,astoria,3,1.0,False

Mostly machine-translated but I corrected  some errors / idioms***

  
In 2022, I graduated from university in International Relations with a good knowledge of Chinese. At first I wanted to go to China for my master's degree: in my second year I went to study in the city of Harbin and fell in love with this country.

My BF and I wanted to move abroad together after graduation, but at that time visa restrictions were not yet lifted because of the Covid. We had to look for an alternative.

We applied to an agency that helps to look for jobs abroad. At first we were offered vacancies as animators in Turkey or Egypt, but at some point the Philippines came up. The requirements included Chinese - it was perfect for me because I didn't want to forget the language without practicing. Back in Russia, we had online interviews, but only I was sent an offer. They offered me an office job in Manila, the capital of the Philippines. We thought about it for a long time, but we decided to go together.

I knew nothing about the Philippines. When I told my parents I was moving to Manila, they said, “Sorry, where to?” I had to learn everything about the visa, local culture, and language right before the trip. I was under the impression that if the Philippines was close to China, they would be similar. But I was wrong․

Working at an online casino

Philippine culture and architecture is a mixture of something Spanish and Asian. Also the mass culture of the Philippines is very influenced by the USA: here even the second official language is English. Most of the inhabitants can maintain a normal conversation in English, so Tagalog I did not learn.

The first time after moving to Manila, I was in shock. Besides having to adapt to the climate, foreign culture and food, I found out where I was going to work. I had a clear description of the offerer: a plain office job. But it turned out to be in the field of POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators) online casinos.  
I realized that I was already in the Philippines and could not quit my job, even if it went against my moral views. It was simply a matter of survival. I stayed in this field for two years, changing three companies.

I always worked 6/1: six days a week in the office. All my colleagues were from different countries: Vietnamese, Koreans, Malaysians, Indonesians. I was the only one from Russia. And it wasn't always easy.

The Asians I met are, for the most part, very noisy. They have almost no understanding of personal boundaries, or they perceive them in their own way. It's a normal story for Filipinos to just not show up for work. HR once wrote to a coworker of mine who didn't show up to the office, worried that something had happened to him. And he replied, “I don't want to come,” and that was it. This is not an isolated case: I think many people here do not think through the consequences of their actions and do not care about the future.

  
I was also always cold in the office. I was freezing for two years in the Philippines - it sounds surreal because it's tropical and it's almost always 30-degree heat outside. But indoors and in offices, the air conditioners are on 16-18°C. I was constantly told: “Polina, you're from Russia, you're used to the cold”. I replied: ""My dears, I am used to the cold, but it is cold outside, and we dress warmly. Inside the houses we keep warm.""

In my first position, I worked in customer support. For the first six months, I supported both myself and my partner: I was paid in the range of $1,100-$1,200 a month. When I quit and got a job at the second company, I recommended my BF them, but he didn't pass the probationary period. Gradually, problems accumulated in our relationships, and we broke up.

At the second company, I had a higher position as a platform manager, but I didn't have enough skills to feel comfortable. So I left and got a job at a third company as an HR manager. During my probationary period, I was paid 1800 dollars a month, and afterwards I was paid 2000 dollars

  
It's a very high salary for the Philippines. We were forbidden to publicize it so that the locals would not know that we expats get much more. For example, a local cashier earns about 270 dollars a month and an office clerk earns about 300 dollars.

In December 2024, I decided to quit my job. I was tired of this schedule to the point where I could no longer continue. I can't remember a single month when I didn't come home in tears and think about quitting.

I was lucky: as soon as I wrote my resignation, in the Philippines, the president issued a decree that banned POGO companies. After that, my company moved to Cambodia.

Dream housing and virgin nature

In Russia I was a photographer and dreamed of returning to that. Since my dismissal, I have been doing photography and videography, teaching Chinese and counseling people on Chinese Batsu astrology. So far I have not been able to reach the previous level of income: in one month I can earn 400 dollars, in the next - 900 dollars.

The company used to issue me a work visa. I just handed in the documents, the rest was the employer's responsibility. After I was fired, I went to Hong Kong to cancel my work visa. Now I am in the Philippines on a tourist visa. With it, I rented an apartment and fly between islands with no problem.

I rent a studio in an apartment complex for 20,000 Philippine pesos (about $350) a month. I can use the pool, gym, movie theater, conference room and co-working space for free. I am happy with everything. At one point I wanted to go back to Russia and thought: how come I have to pay for the gym? And for the swimming pool too?

  
I am fascinated by the nature of the Philippines. It is so diverse that there is something for everyone. I can get to Boracay, one of the most beautiful islands, in an hour by airplane. If I want to go surfing, I can fly to Siargao Island. Manila is located on the largest island of Luzon, and there are many mountains and waterfalls.

I like the smiling Filipinos and their positive attitude to everything. When my parents flew to visit me, they said: “People don't smile like that in Russia”. When I flew to Russia on vacation after living in the Philippines for a year and a half, I noticed it too.

Bureaucracy, visual noise and poverty

But the Philippines has its drawbacks. In Manila, for example, it is impossible to walk down the street. It is very difficult to walk from your neighborhood to a neighboring neighborhood because there are no pedestrian walkways. Public transportation is very inconvenient and runs on a strange schedule. There are also jeepneys, one of the symbols of the Philippines. I never know where they are going and they are terribly unenvironmental: they emit black smoke. I always travel by cab and have got used to it, but when I remember how well developed public transportation is in Russia, it becomes sad.

The Philippines can compete with Russia in the level of bureaucracy. You can't make a move here without a piece of paper. Once I ordered a mirror for myself. The parcel was left in the lobby, and I thought I could pick it up quickly from there. But they sent me to the local housing office to get a permit. I ran around the residence and did the paperwork to get the mirror home.

Filipinos are very slow people. Any process that can be stretched out, they will stretch it out. They are also very religious and believe that everything is predetermined by god, so there is no way they can change their lives. That said, Filipinos are a very friendly nation and will always help.

Manila is quite a dirty city. On my way to get a coffee, I can meet a person sleeping on a cardboard on the street. The dirt, the smells, the poor people on the streets - it makes it hard for me. I try to surround myself with beautiful things and be in something visually pleasing.

I don't see the Philippines as a permanent place to live - more like a phase. But for now, the pros outweigh the cons. Next year, I plan to enroll in a master's program in China. I've been dreaming about it for five years, but it hasn't worked out so far. I want to enter a creative field and develop as a photographer.

if you’re reading through this, thanks for your time! it really means a lot to me
posted this here because I really want to find someone (or THE someone) out there who shares a lot of interests with me, involved in some fandoms, and maybe someone who is a little creative and likes to create, share, and write (even though this post doesn’t look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  🖤

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **""Yankees vs. Reds: When Your Starter’s Worse Than a Pop Song in 2025""**

The New York Yankees (45-32) roll into Cincinnati to face the Reds (40-38) on June 24, 2025, armed with a 1.5-run spread advantage and a starting pitcher, **Allan Winans**, who’s about as reliable as a TikTok trend. The Reds, meanwhile, counter with **Nick Lodolo**, a pitcher who’s basically the anti-Winans, fresh off a 4-1 win over the Cardinals.

**The Odds:**

* **Moneyline:** Yankees -1.6 (favorites), Reds +2.4 (underdogs).
* **Spread:** Yankees -1.5 (-110), Reds +1.5 (-110).
* **Total:** 9.5 runs (Over +183, Under -233).

**Why the Reds Might Win This With a Straight Face:**  
Lodolo (4.20 ERA, 1.25 WHIP) has the stuff of a guy who’d probably win a “Most Likely to Be a Barista” contest—consistent, unshowy, and not prone to spilling coffee (i.e., giving up runs). The Yankees? They’re starting Winans, who’s authored a 5.85 ERA and a 1.55 WHIP this season. Fun fact: Winans’ ERA is higher than the Reds’ team batting average (.252).

**The Under Is a Safe Bet for Grandma:**  
With both teams’ offenses resembling a slow-motion car crash (Yankees: .238 team BA, Reds: .245), the **UNDER 9.5 runs** (-233) is as safe as a vault in a world of Bitcoin memes. The Reds have hit the UNDER in 5 of their last 7 games; the Yankees? They’ve hit the UNDER exactly once in their last 10.

**Prediction:**  
The Reds will win 3-2 in 10 innings, with Lodolo looking like a $100 million draft pick and Winans looking like he forgot his own pitch count. The Yankees’ offense will muster exactly one hit, a double by Aaron Judge that’s ruled a ground rule single because the umpire was distracted by a squirrel.

**Final Score:** Reds 3, Yankees 2.  
**How It Happens:** The UNDER cashes, the Reds cover the 1.5-run spread, and the Yankees’ GM starts drafting a press release for next year’s “Rebuild 2026: Electric Boogaloo.”

*Place your bets before the Yankees’ lineup becomes a case study in why you never trust a pitcher named “Allan.”* 🎲⚾

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Rangers vs. Orioles: A ""Home Run"" for the UNDER? Let’s Go!**

The Texas Rangers (38-40) and Baltimore Orioles (33-44) clash on June 24 in a matchup that’s about as exciting as a spreadsheet—*but hey, spreadsheets have their charms*. The Orioles, favored at -135, will send lefty **Trevor Rogers** (who’s probably still explaining his 2023 tax returns) against the Rangers’ **Patrick Corbin**, who’s 0-3 with a 5.40 ERA in his last five starts. Corbin’s already given up 11 home runs this season, and Baltimore’s **Gary Sanchez** (2 HRs in 18 games) is a prop-bet goldmine, especially since he’s 3-for-10 with a dinger in his last two vs. Corbin.

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **Money Line**: Orioles -135, Rangers +120
* **Total Runs**: Over/Under 10.0 (-110 for both)
* **Spreads**: Orioles -1.5 (+110), Rangers +1.5 (-130)

**Why Bet the UNDER?**  
Because these teams are about as explosive as a wet firework. The Rangers scored 3 runs in their last game, and the Orioles? They lost to the Yankees 2-4. Both teams have hit the UNDER in 6 of their last 10 games. If you’re betting the UNDER 10.0, you’re basically predicting a game where the combined score will make your grandma ask, “Is this baseball or naptime?”

**Prop Bet Alert**:

* **Gary Sanchez**: Over 0.5 HR (-150). He’s a free swinger with a .300 ISO (slugging minus batting average) against lefties. Corbin’s ERA vs. LHBs? A friendly 6.23.

**Final Pick**:  
Take the **UNDER 10.0** (-110). It’s a safe bet for those who’d rather not watch a pitching duel that’s more “boring but profitable” than “thrilling but stressful.”

*Remember: If you bet on Sanchez’s HR, you’re betting on a man who’s turned 18 games into a home-run derby. If you bet the UNDER, you’re betting on a game that’ll make you question why you didn’t just watch paint dry.*

*Odds as of June 24, 2025. May your bets be profitable and your coffee strong.* 🎲⚾

1lizkoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpellcasterReviews/comments/1lizkoj/review_of_this_subreddit/,Review of this subreddit,"

Instead of doing a review on a caster I am going to do a review on this subreddit (Better read before it gets deleted, because I am quite certain it's going to be taken down)

I believe their are ""tiers"" or ""levels"" or whatever you want to call it of spell casters. Like how their are teachers for example. Both 2 teachers can get their qualifications but one can suck or another one can be great. Or how one coffee can work for you and another type of coffee makes you feel horrible, just as an example. 

Just to make as an example here are the tiers of casters I have seen on here (making up the tier names):

1. Scammers (Not really a tier): but they are fakers, probably don't even cast spells, and for sure do not work

2. Beginners: They casted some spells and genuinely believe in their work but they just don't have what it takes to cast and affect change for others

3. Apprentice: These casters are genuine as well, but a lot of their spells don't work, maybe they have a lucky break here and there but they need more practicing

4. Intermediate: These casters are like 50/50, sometimes they work sometimes they don't

5. Advanced: These casters are like 60-70% range

etc

Point is levels 2+ they are genuine they want to genuinely help and actually do genuinely help (now whether they should be offering their services online is another convo). Also from my experience, from a customer perspective, your mindset, belief, throughout the spellcasting process is another convo, but even if you take 50 people (with little belief) to an advanced practitioner, I believe the 60-70% range would drop to near 1% if not 0, But that's another convo on its own. 

So my point with this is, yes there are scammers for sure. But there are a ton I mean a ton of legitimate casters that are being mentioned in this subreddit that are being labeled as scams. This is where the gray area is. 

People wonder why this subreddit has ""never came across a real caster""? Have you thought to think that since all there is in this subreddit is just scams being thrown around, that it affects the beliefs and mindsets of others (which affects the spell) and that if some people dont get results, they are labeled as scams, that ofc no ""real caster"" is going to be brought up. 

It also does not help that the moderator of this group ""Larry Levine"", doesn't even believe in spells himself, like make that make sense. If you are the mod of a spellcaster review subreddit and you don't believe in spells, then get rid of it lol. Now the argument can be made, ""well it's to protect others from getting scammed"". Sure, but if it's actually done in a conductive manner where just because some people did not get results they are not labeled as scammers. Their should be other metrics involved. And not to mention but by letting people just openly label genuine casters as scams, you are ruining the image of genuine casters. 

Also something else to mention which can be an entire other topic, but some casters work for some people, situation etc, but not for others. I think that sometimes. you just need to find the right caster for you. It's like a therapist, one therapist might work great for one person, but not for somebody else. Does that make them a scam? No lol 

In the end, this subreddit could be great, it really could.

I feels so alone.,"My Son's mother and I split when he was 2 months old. It was a toxic relationship. It was really bad. I was in the process of leaving the relationship when I lost my brother to suicide and found out she was pregnant in a 5 day span. There was alot of mixed emotions and I felt guilty  I wasnt there for my brother. I did what i feel most men would do and try and make it work. It was not the way to go. Things escalated out of control. Ill admit I started hard in on the whiskey about that time. We fought constantly. Viciously. I was stabbed with a pair of scissors, had shoes thrown at my face while I slept. I never called the cops, never hit her. It was pure chaos. I was losing myself. It felt like I was living with a demon. Yes I fought back but if I raised my voice she would call the cops. I was never arrested or asked to leave. Fast forward to a couple months after he was born. She came home asked how the day went. I said he had fell asleep during Tummy time and I took a nap as well. She flew off the handle claiming I tried to kill him. She kept charging me while I was holding him so I naturally pushed her away. She calls the cops. She gets arrested for the marks she left on me and she had none on her. I decided that I needed to go to rehab. I wasn't drinking all the time just every night after work and it was in excess. Im 6 years sober 7/11. She goes on Go Fund me and says that I abandoned her and the kid gets something like 12k. Whatever. I get out of rehab. She shows up to where Im staying with a bottle of whiskey. I didn't partake and explained we couldn't be together. Another nuclear event happens. Won't let me see him unless she needed someone else to watch him. Which I always did. This goes on for about a year and a half. This whole time I was giving her money for him. She puts child support on me. Says I never payed her a dime. Judge said the state looks at it as a gift. Im 18k in debt to her all of a sudden. She never had any ambitions in life when we were together. I had a great opportunity to advance my career. She finds out about it and all of a sudden wants to move to New Orleans to go to school to be a yoga instructor. I admittedly didn't have my life in place enough to pursue custody. I was in a roommate situation and didn't have the bedroom for him that Florida requires. I signed a paper saying she could move to LA and that we would pursue custody later. The day she gets to NOLA. Im blocked on every platform. Zero contact. I would do online backround checks and send gifts to the registered address. Never heard anything. Year and a half later. Her Mom pops up on my FB feed as someone I might know. I added her knowing it would stir the pot. All of a sudden I'm getting mad text through Phone and FB Messenger. Same old stuff. Finally about a year ago. Her aunt passed away and the came to Florida. Come to find out they left NO and moved to Baltimore, Michigan and now live in St. Louis. While she was here she said he wanted to see me and we were gonna meet for coffee. I show up and she brings her friends. They hate me. We decide to go to a playground. Yet he had been throwing up so I offered for them to ride in my car as so he doesn't throw up in the rental. The friend drive her rental. They get in my car and make a show about having a location thing incase something happens.. You know always made to be a monster. We go to the park my son and I have a great time. Found out he liked video games and he said he played Roblox on PS5. He tells me his screen name. We part ways. I buy a PS5 and we start playing games. We get along really well. Then come to find out through talking to him she has told him. I tried to kill him.  She finds out about us playing and and kicks him from playing. Then a week later I get a call. He wants to see you on his birthday. I applied for a credit card and got everything set up. I know what she was trying to do. I had it set to be there on his Bday but made me change my time to a week later because whatever reason. So I fly up to STL. She was with us for 5 days straight. 5 days of just a barrage of how horrible of a person I am. I took it. I had to. It hit a point where we were at a car show and I said I liked this car over that one and just like she had been doing the whole time was assassinating my opinion. That when I looked at her and said I am allowed to have my opinions. She was quit for the rest of the day. I flew out the day. Fast forward to May. My son loves wrestlimg and i found out there was a show in STL. I flew there. Him and i were able to have a couple days alone for the most part. She kept showing up at the Air BNB. All in all we had a great time. I fly home. At this point my son and I face time atlest 3 times a week. We have gotten pretty close over the past 6 months. I have a new place now and I have the extra room with a buck bed and WWE  blankets. He wants to come down here so bad. After I got home from STL I found out there was a WWE show in Birmingham Al. It exactly between where I live and STL. I payed for His, Her and my ticket and the Air bnb. He has been asking to come down here alot. So last week I brought it up to her that I could take 2 weeks off of work after the show and he could come for a week or 2. Now we are back to square 1. She doest want me to see him again till he is 10. He will be 8 this year and now for for some reason we watch RAW every Monday together on FT. He all of a sudden can't watch it with me. I contacted a lawyer here in FL. Apparently I need one in STL. I have a consultation on Friday. Its just ridiculous. I feel alone and I am doing everything I can to keep myself grounded. Im sorry for the rant. Its not like there are alot of places we can talk about this.

I have various hobbies that i enjoy most of them on the nerdy side of things. 

A big one is playing games I play on PC mostly and I have a switch. My main game is FFXIV currently and I spend most nights either raiding or crafting. I do also farm some mounts from time to time. I also play league moslty TFT but I just have fun running it down on an aram or climbing to gold for my free skin. I have a plethora of multi-player games like Helldivers 2, Stardew Valley, Risk of Rain, and Monster Hunter. I have a lot of other random games and happy to try new ones. I also like pokemon and Mario games as well but don't play those as often anymore. 

I am a huge fan of horror movies and media is often am on the lookout for new hidden gems. Some of my favorites include midsommar, coffee table, where evil lurks, REC and i really could go on. I also enjoy comedy and action films. As for shows I feel like I often go more for documentaries and paranormal type shows. I reallg just like all sorts of spooky stuff and cryptids. Sprinkling in other types of show and anime. I am currently watching a few airing anime like go go loser ranger season 2, kowloon generic romance and witch watch. Always happy to give and take recommendations. 

Going to the gym is a semi hobby/lifestyle change. Have been going for a while and it's been nice I hope to continue and get healthier doing that if you want to talk about gym stuff I'm always down! 


Another of my hobbies is actually a new thing which is building gunpla and I recently got a airbrush so I am hoping to learn how to paint and just generally learn more about this hobby it's been an exciting start. 

There's definitely more about me to learn and I'm happy to answer questions and just chat. I honestly prefer voice chats a lot more since they flow a lot more naturally than texting if you ask me. Oh right I also have pets a cat and a dog will be happy to share pictures of them.

Taren Varns had never seen the inside of the chamber.

Not truly.


Not past the veil.


But when Aoi spoke that single word—

[Dispel]


—something ancient unlatched. The silent hum that had warded the place for centuries fell away like the last breath of a dying storm.



And for the first time—

The Sword-Sage beheld the truth behind the legend.

There she was.

Suspended in a pillar of light. Her body encased in crystal, untouched by time. The Prismatic Arbiter. The cloaked figure from the tale of his youth.

The one his ancestors bowed to without knowing her face.

Now here.

Before him.

Real.

Taren collapsed fully to both knees. Not from reverence. But from something heavier, unmooring shock. His arms gave way, hands slapping against the cold floor with a dull thud that echoed through the brightened chamber.

Aoi turned slightly at the sound.

He didn’t speak.

He didn’t need to.

He simply nodded, once.

An unspoken gesture that said: You may enter. It’s safe now.

Taren didn’t rise.

Instead, he crawled forward— slowly, unsteadily, like a child approaching a forgotten home. Hands and knees against smooth stone, each movement deliberate. Fragile.

He stopped four paces in.

The light of the chamber touched his weathered face. His breath quivered as he lifted his gaze—

First to Aoi.

Then upward.

To her.

The true body of the Prismatic Arbiter.

⸻

Aoi’s head tilted slightly.

Footsteps.

He felt them, a cluster of Seeker initiates approaching the outer corridors. Likely drawn by the earlier clash, or perhaps by the sudden silence that followed it.

He didn’t raise a hand.
His hands remained tucked in his pockets—unmoving, casual.
And yet, mana rippled outward in a seamless wave, precise as a blade.
A domain unfolded across the Prismatic Arbiter’s chamber.

Not a shield. Not a wall.

A veil.

To any who arrived at the threshold, the space would appear empty. Undisturbed. A quiet, meeting chamber. Nothing unusual.

The footsteps paused.

Then retreated.

Satisfied.

Gone.

Only then did Aoi lift his eyes once more to the floating crystal.

To her.

To Mira.

His gaze sharpened.

And began to glow—bright, unrestrained, blue.

Then, for the first time since his return to Elyndor—

He let go.

The air shifted.

Pressure dropped.

His mana, long held in check, surged outward in a wave of force. Ancient. Boundless. It filled every inch of the chamber like crashing wind, and Taren, still kneeling, was pushed back by the sheer force of it.

He fell on his rear with a muted grunt, breath knocked out of him, staring up at Aoi in awe.

Aoi didn’t blink.

Didn’t breathe.

He simply stared at Mira.

A short pause—

And then—

He raised his hand.

Toward the crystal.

Toward the seal.

And began to undo it.

⸻

Moments before the events in the Seekers’ headquarters…

Prismatic light and ruin danced in a storm of battle.

The Prismatic Arbiter’s marionette—

and the Fragment Core of the First Demon Lord—

clashed with forces that threatened to sunder the world itself.

West of Nirea, the sky split with color and chaos.

Lyra stood with the villagers, eyes wide. Behind her, a sea of adventurers gathered—silent, breath held, hearts pounding. None of them spoke.

Above them, the horizon shimmered.

Lights collided like falling stars, explosions of pure mana echoing like distant thunder. Red. Blue. Violet. Gold. Each impact shattered clouds and bent the sky’s fabric.

It looked like a war fought by thousands—millions, perhaps.

But it wasn’t.

It was two.

Just two.

The Prismatic Arbiter… and something else.

A humanoid shadow cloaked in tattered red and black.

Not just a monster.

A being of purpose.

Of command.

Of hunger.

Lyra could feel it, down to her bones. This was not the kind of magic humans were meant to see.

Not and live.

———

Up above—

The fragmented core of the First Demon Lord hovered effortlessly. His voice echoed in Ancient Elyrien—
twisted, deep, laced with disdain.

“Impressive. The creatures of this era are… competent.”

His glowing eyes narrowed, gazing down where the remains of the Arch Dreadform Revenant lay scattered.

“In my time, they screamed and clung to Thalos like frightened animals.”

He laughed— a cold, cruel sound that made the very mana around him ripple with corruption.

Then his voice shifted, sharper. Calculating.

“Now I know what era I’ve awakened in. Thalos is gone. But his echo remains… in pests like them.”

He turned toward the Prismatic Arbiter, eyes narrowing.

“Still, you’re all inferior. Your mana levels are pitiful. Frail. This world has grown weak.”

His staff rose.

“It’s time to end this.”

A black orb of twisted energy began to form—dense, volatile, flickering with blood-red lightning.

The Prismatic Arbiter raised both hands in response, ready to counter.

But then—

The orb shifted.

Redirected.

Not toward her.

North.

Far north.

Toward the Lightward Trail.

Her eyes widened beneath the veil of her magic. “No—”

The Demon Lord’s shadowed lips curled into a smile.

And then it fired.

A beam of compressed darkness tore through the sky—silent, but devastating. It streaked like a lance of ruin toward the Lightward Trail, and the moment it struck—

The mana-thread connecting the Prismatic Arbiter to her marionette fractured.

Not cut.

Not destroyed.

But violently distorted.

She staggered mid-air, trying to maintain control, her hands crackling with unstable light.

She tried to speak, a spell on her unmoving lips.

But before a word escaped—

The shadow moved.

Faster than light. Behind her in an instant.

A blade of red-black mana slashed across her back.

Then—a kick, brutal and direct, sent her flying.

She crashed downward, her body vanishing into the massive crater, the very one where Kael, Yael, and Seris stood.

⸻

They had just begun to smile.

Kael wiped the blood from his brow. Yael sat on a broken chunk of armor. Seris leaned on her staff, her breath steadying.

The Arch Dreadform was gone. They’d done the impossible.

Then—

A thud.

A shadow crashed into the ground before them, sending dust skyward.

The moment it cleared—

Seris gasped.

The Prismatic Arbiter’s marionette lay twisted on the ground, the damage now visible. The veil had lifted. Her left arm was gone, cleaved just below the shoulder. The figure of invincibility shattered.

But before anyone could speak—

She moved.

Rising slowly. Shakily. Her remaining hand lifted toward Seris—not to cast, but to reassure. A gesture that said: I’m still here.

Then all four looked up.

And saw it.

Descending from the skies like a god of old ruin—

The First Demon Lord, or what remained of it, in his humanoid form. Corrupted aura rained down upon them like acid wind. Even without touching it, their skin prickled, souls recoiling.

It laughed.

And the ground seemed to tremble with it.

Kael stepped forward—

And then froze.

A voice.

Inside his head.

“Hey. Can you hold that thing for five full minutes?”

Aoi.

His voice was calm. Almost playful.

“I’m counting on you, Kael. You’re good at buying time.”

Kael opened his mouth to respond, but the voice was already fading.

“Bye.”

The connection cut.

And the Prismatic Arbiter’s marionette—

collapsed.

The mana thread connecting her to the real Prismatic Arbiter severed completely.

Kael took one breath.

Two.

Then whispered—

“…Oh, we’re so screwed.”

Each morning I rise with the sacred task:
Proof of citizenship? Better not ask.
I pack my ID, birth cert, green card too
Because skin this brown is never “true.”

Uncle Sam remembers me, no doubt
My taxes ensure I never drop out.
Health insurance? Premiums sky high,
Just to make sure my kids don’t die.

Student loans? Oh, quite the feast
One for me, one for each little beast.
Throw in a mortgage with taxes that bite
Just in case I forget I have no right.

But what is labor? What is grace?
When a face like mine must stay in its place.
Degrees and deeds can’t shield my tone,
This melanin’s louder than any milestone.

So we carry our numbers, nine digits of pride,
Proof we’re allowed to survive inside.
Labeled “legal,” though irony screams
I’m more native than their colonial dreams.

Yes, I recall … it’s all too clear,
1492 came sailing near.
“Welcome!” we said. “Just guests!” they swore.
Then came the guns, the chains, the war.

It echoes again in a desert place,
Where families run, with no time to trace.
From Gaza to Mexico, same old script
Invited, then evicted, identity stripped.

For years I bowed, head slightly low,
Taught to comply, keep status quo.
But beneath this skin, another voice
Not of shame, but of sacred choice.

Aztec, Maya, Inca pride
Olmec bones that never died.
No, I don’t speak their native tongue,
But the blood in me knows every rung.

So I leave my house with faith in hand,
To a God imported from a foreign land.
I pray He blinds the hunters near,
Who smell my skin and trade my fear.

They count in quotas, price our names,
Like they once did with my siblings in chains.
Brown like coffee, priced like coal
To them, just another soul on patrol.

But I walk on, heart loud, head high,
Carving truth into every lie.
Because though they branded me “less than them,”
I rise each day, descendant of kings and women who bled for when.

Just a place to process I guess.

We were dating for 6 months. She refused to become officially exclusive despite being exclusive to me sexually the whole time (apparently). She 'didn't want a relationship' but did want to go on dates, consistently have sex, talk on the phone for hours every day, be each other's main support system etc.

After 6 months, I felt the pros were now outweighed by the cons (constant anxiety, mutual jealousy that couldn't be addressed because she refused to commit), and broke it off.

I didn't speak to her for 2 months. I started going on dates again with someone else who is more aligned to me, albeit with the caveat that I was processing another relationship ending and needed to take things very slow.

She (the ex) reached out to me a few times over the course of that 2 months. A few messages here and there. She also posted numerous stories that were obvious bait for me. I knew she would be out seeing other people pretty immediately because I had heard a lot of her dating history, and saw she had a pattern of having someone/multiple people around for validation and sex but without intention to commit.

We ran into each other recently. She asked to have coffee and then asked to continue and have lunch.

I agreed, which may have been stupid. Honestly, a part of me was curious and wanted to see if she would apologise for some of her behaviour (which was bad), whether she had any regrets, whether time apart had made her realise she had been a bit of an a-hole.

She asked how I'd been and I'd said good. She wanted more info and probed and asked about my family and whether they hate her, asked after my friends, my work. She told me she'd gotten sober. We both said we are seeing other people - she explicitly told me she 'kind of likes' one of the guys she's seeing but when I said 'in a ""I need validation and I'm bored way""' she smirked and said that was basically it (ick). I told her I was seeing someone else and getting to know her, told her the new woman is really nice to me/gasses me up/treats me well. She was obviously bothered, especially when I made it clear I was already sexually exclusive with this woman if only for respect/sexual health reasons.

She said she had reflected and realised she only ever saw me as a friend. To be honest, I think that's cope, but I'm sure that's the narrative she is telling herself. She also tried to gaslight me and said she broke up with me, and I pointed out that she did not and I ended it and that she even begged to be friends and requested that we have a friendship where I never disclose who I'm sleeping with. I pointed out that that fact alone indicates she didn't just see me as a friend.

She asked if we could be friends now and apologised numerous times for hurting me. I said we could maybe work towards friendship over time but that I really didn't feel she understood the severity of some of her behaviour.

She said 'I know I could have you back anytime I want'. She also said 'so you're ok if I end up with someone else' which is a very bizarre thing to say, given we've broken up so one would think it's almost certain we'd BOTH end up with someone else?

Since this run in, she messaged me with a meme and has told me she will try and be in that same place at the same time consistently (i.e. told me how to see her again).

I find the whole thing very strange, honestly. If she only ever saw us as a friendship, her comments even from that accidental meet up would indicate otherwise. I don't understand why she is so hellbent on keeping contact if she's already sleeping with multiple other people. I suspect me leaving and showing 'value' by immediately being picked up by someone else has somehow made me more interesting to her, in a fucked up way.

I know I will have to set firm boundaries with her and tell her that she needs to stop fixating on me/trying to engage with me for some time and that a friendship, if it ever were to happen, would be way further down the line. I just don't understand people.",1,1750730025.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

I'm taking Methylphenidate ER 18mg for now and it's almost been a week. I've been feeling good but there was one day where I felt some mild chest/heart tightness. It happened as soon as I took a sip of coffee. It would come and go, and lasted for like 10 minutes. Although I'm not really sure if the coffee had anything to do with the tightness because it happened seconds after my sip, and I don't think caffeine hits the body that quickly like a cigarette or whatever would? Regardless, this made me really paranoid. I tried decaf a day later and felt totally fine. And when I took ADHD meds in the past like Adderall, I would drink strong coffee and not get any problems.

So I wonder if this was just a coincidence? Or if mixing ADHD meds and caffeine together can indeed be dangerous for some people, especially as you get older.

I will say that I do get small chest tightness for a minute, a few times in a year. But the absolute worst experience was when I took in a lot of nicotine this one particular day. It scared the shit out of me and made me stop all forms of nicotine cold turkey. Haven't experienced it since then. But since nicotine and caffeine are both stimulants, and then you mix in another stimulant (ADHD meds), is there a chance I could experience that intense chest tightness again? I know most of you guys aren't doctors but would be interested to hear your experiences. I see my psychiatrist in a few weeks anyway.

Just a note: If you place this on an empty lot that costs more than 750 Simoleons, such as a 1000 Simoleon lot, the overall price would come to 1,028 Simoleons, but your Sim could move into a starter home first, collect 28 Simoleons and then purchase this Starter Home & Coffee Shop.

If you want your Sims to purchase this straight away and don’t want to save up 28 Simoleons, you can bulldoze the Canal Corner home that sits on the 20x15 lot in Evergreen Harbor, which then leaves you with a 750 Simoleon empty lot.

At first, it was casual — like, “hey I bought eggs, feel free to use them” — and it kind of evolved into us doing a weekly grocery run together and splitting the cost.

The issue is, he’s started using *my* stuff outside of the grocery split without asking — things like my olive oil, protein powder (which I buy separately because it's expensive), my coffee pods, even my skincare sometimes.

I told her last week, nicely, that I’d appreciate if he asked before using things I bought with my own money, especially when they’re not part of our shared shopping. He apologized, but yesterday I noticed half my new oat milk was gone, and that he used my $40 face serum again (I literally marked the bottle to check).

When I brought it up again he got defensive and said, “We live together, it’s not that deep,” and that I “always make a big deal out of little things.” I honestly don’t think I’m being petty, I just don’t like my stuff being used without permission. It’s not even about the money at this point — it just feels disrespectful.

He’s been cold with me since, and now I’m wondering… **am I overreacting** for being annoyed about this? Or is this just normal roommate stuff I should chill about?",3,1750729780.0,AmIOverreacting,4,1.0,False

(I’m hoping it will help with hip pain and skin itching that has been a real downer over the last 5 years.). Anyways, I did my first 36 hour fast last week.  Usually I do 20:4 or 16:8.  I felt good and had bone broth, coffee and sugar free liquid IV.  The next day I didn’t fast and had 3 light meals…. And quite a few strawberries. 🍓 That night, I ended up having the worst migraine I’ve had in 5 years and then threw up which is very uncommon for me 🤮 The whole being sick thing lasted for about 4 hours and then I felt fine…. Actually really good after that Side note: our family also went strawberry picking the day before I was sick and I ate strawberries right out of the field so it could have been that too.  I’ve read a few books on fasting that mentions when you start doing longer fasts that there are some detox symptoms and I’m wondering if it was that or just food poisoning/too much sugar from the berries?

Chapter 1
I was a devoted wife and mother.
I left my job to be a cook for Eric Simpson for a decade. Regardless of his infidelity, it didn't bother me.
Every day, I carefully laid out a full table of dishes and waited for him to come home.
Later, his voice trembled as he begged, ""Jessica, please... no more.""
I shook my head and forced the scalding soup down his throat.
A man who enjoyed cheating must have a good appetite, so he had to consume all of it.
 * * *
""Jessica, look at how adorable our child is and how much she sticks to you.
""Why don't you remain at home to spend more time with her?
A familiar voice echoed in my ears, causing me to tremble all over.
Wasn't I dead? My thoughts were racing.
My husband, Eric, believed I was blocking his path, so he took away my rights after I gave birth.
But he was still fearful and secretly conspired with my trusted secretary, Kaylee Harrison.
They framed me by placing me in bed with a strange man, accusing me of infidelity.
That day, Los Angeles buzzed with rumors about the leaked images of the Quinn Group's heiress in bed.
I was stimulated and returned home to fulfill my role as a housewife for a decade as they wished.
Kaylee even moved into the same building and ate the meals I carefully prepared every day.
After ten years of cooking and tending to them, I inadvertently uncovered the truth, and they realized I knew.
They burned everything to ashes.
With my soul ablaze, I could only hover nearby, watching them become increasingly brazen without me.
They wasted the Quinn Group's business that my father built, and they treated my child like a pet.
When I woke up again, I found myself back in the moment right after giving birth.
 * * *
Eric was dressed impeccably in a suit and tie, and the cunning hidden within his eyes was more apparent than I remembered.
""Jessica, I came to check on you. ""
The sound of Kaylee's high heels pierced the air as she entered, carrying tonic soup.
The diamond necklace adorning her neck sparkled so radiantly that it made me feel dizzy. It was the birthday gift I had given her last month, and now it dangled over the hickey Eric had left.
In my previous life, I felt sympathy for her and treated her like a younger sister, failing to notice those signs.
I assumed she was merely being a bit casual, and nothing was wrong with it.
Now, seeing the unspoken ambiguity between the two of them, I tightened my grip on the bed sheet, my nails digging into my palms.
""You two look perfect together. Anyone would mistake you for a married couple.""
My words hit them like a slap. They froze.
Eric rushed to soothe me, while Kaylee put on her usual sweet act.
In my previous life, I'd been blind to something so glaringly obvious.
""Wendy,"" I called my maid, keeping my tone gentle.
""Starting today, no one steps into this house without my permission.""
I watched Kaylee's eyes widen in shock and added, ""Kaylee, don't trouble yourself to help me anymore.""
She instantly panicked—I had never treated her that way before. ""Jessica...""
Eric quickly jumped in, ""Jessica's just exhausted from childbirth. Don't take it to heart.""
The moment he touched my hand, I nearly gagged.
He was the one who drenched me in gasoline in my previous life.
I turned away and pretended to sleep, letting Wendy see them off.
The memory of flames searing my skin felt so fresh that tears soaked my pillow before I even noticed.
This time, I wouldn't let Eric and Kaylee recreate my past.
They'd repay their sins in blood.

Chapter 2
In my previous life, I never suspected my husband or my secretary, completely unaware of when they became a pair.
But looking back, they must have been plotting to take the Quinn Group long before.
My father had wanted me to inherit the company, but some old-fashioned board members refused.
They claimed a woman couldn't handle such responsibility and insisted my husband should take over instead.
He was young, ambitious, and well-mannered, so he was worth a chance. After all, he was marrying into my family.
Not wanting to cause a scene, I proposed a fair competition between Eric and me.
But then, I was tricked into getting pregnant. Once I recovered from childbirth, I tried returning to work.
Yet every time I stepped into the office, my daughter, Cecilia, would suddenly fall sick.
My little girl, just months old, would spike a fever or suffer from stomach troubles. I couldn't bear to let my child suffer like that.
I devoted myself to raising Cecilia until she started kindergarten. When I tried returning to work, my position had disappeared.
People only admired Eric's decisiveness and efficiency, but they never realized I was the one who trained him.
Forced into domestic life, I worked as a housewife for ten years.
I pored over recipes daily, believing I was helping Eric recuperate, but I didn't see his schemes coming.
""Jessica, what's going on with you today?
""Don't you always treat Kaylee like family? Why did you act that way toward her? She was crying when she left.""
I came back to reality and acted fragile when Eric questioned me.
""Hubby, I'm sorry. I care about you so much. It bothers me when I watch you two looking so perfect together.""
Satisfied with my explanation, Eric brought Kaylee to my bed.
""Jessica, I don't blame you. We're as close as sisters, aren't we?
""Oh, the baby looks adorable. If she were mine, I'd never let her out of my sight.
""If you don't, children won't bond with their mothers later.""
They both gave me different examples, and I pretended to be overwhelmed.
When Eric suggested I focus on Cecilia, I nodded eagerly. ""You're right. Cece needs her mother.""
Once their plan worked, their grins nearly spilled over.
I kept my eyes downcast, playing the harmless wife. But delicate petals often hide the sharpest thorns.
In the weeks that followed, I perfected my act as a devoted wife and mother.
My complete absorption in mothering convinced them I'd abandoned all career ambitions.
One evening, Eric casually slung an arm around me after playing with Cecilia.
""Honey, what's your take on this business deal? Could it work?""
My stomach turned, but I held back my disgust at his touch.
I looked at the plan with obvious problems, but I acted amazed. ""You have a good eye!""
He quickly convinced me, used Cecilia to keep me home, and said he'd handle it alone.
I agreed easily and suggested bringing Kaylee along.
""Kaylee is my bestie. When you travel, don't let other women tempt you. I'll have her watch you.""
Eric agreed quickly, but I saw contempt in his eyes.
I secretly mocked this fool, thinking he couldn't even spot the many flaws in the deal.
No wonder the Quinn Group collapsed so fast in my previous life.

Chapter 3
During the night, sounds came from the baby's bed.
I caressed Cecilia's head and suddenly recalled how they had drugged her with sleeping pills in my previous life.
That was when they started worrying I might reclaim the business.
Right after they departed, I reached out to company contacts.
When my father passed away, he gave me a group of loyal people placed in key company roles.
In my previous life, I trusted that cheater's words and believed they only followed my father's orders.
This time, I secretly called them and said I'd only communicate privately from now on.
They kept asking me to come back and run the company, promising to help clear my path.
I said no. If I returned too easily, my targets would get suspicious.
To ruin them completely, I had to drive them insane first.
Before his business trip, Eric had boasted about securing a major deal. Once he was gone, his supporters began pressuring me.
Rumors spread that Eric had been working hard for the company, so he deserved to inherit it.
They said I, the real heiress, had lost my drive after having a baby.
I ignored what my subordinates told me. Those people were just minor players anyway.
Then, two major company shareholders approached me and asked me to give Eric control immediately.
""Sure, but my husband is still inexperienced. My father built the Quinn Group after all. I'd hate to see it falter. Besides, what will happen to you both then?""
The two shareholders, who seemed indifferent before, started thinking after I planted those doubts.
They used to work under my father. What if Eric became suspicious of them once he took charge?
""How about this? Once my husband finishes his project successfully, I'll think about stepping aside.""
I then acted worried about nursing my baby and left the two shareholders still thinking about my words.
Soon, the company chatter shifted from praising Eric's potential to questioning whether he should inherit anything before proving himself.
Nobody expected the project to fail since he'd promised perfect results before leaving.
While rumors peaked, I was researching how much poison to use in cooking.
Eric stormed home looking defeated, his eyes blazing with fury.
""Jessica! What happened? We lost 10 million dollars!""
His forehead showed bulging veins as he almost threw the soup bowl.
I caught his wrist, my fingers brushing the mole Kaylee loved to kiss.
Looking up innocently, I said, ""Don't get upset, Hubby. Have some soup to relax. I spent three hours making it.
""Did the project fail? I had no idea.""
I pretended to be completely ignorant, but Eric kept grinding his teeth.
""What do you think? Didn't you miss all those problems in that plan?""
Setting down the soup, I fought my disgust and held Eric's arm.
""I'm not sure what went wrong. My thinking hasn't been clear recently.
""Don't people say women get confused after having babies? But Hubby, did you also miss those plan problems?""
Eric froze. After all, the projects I approved usually ended up making money.

Chapter 4
Swallowing his defeat, Eric returned to the office only to discover he had missed the chance to inherit the company.
Though boiling with rage, he kept his temper in check around me, instead focusing on calming his panicked staff.
At home, I devoted myself to perfecting each dish before delivering it to Eric's office.
Always playing the doting husband in public, he gratefully accepted every meal I brought.
""Jessica, you're bringing Eric lunch again.
""I could never cook like you. I just eat whatever my maid prepares.""
Kaylee pretended to be jealous while secretly showing off.
The truth was that she ate every single dish I made.
Just like in my previous life, she would eat each meal I prepared, with Eric.
It gave her a hidden feeling of victory, though she seemed to forget I was the one who helped her get a job when she was struggling financially.
I smiled warmly and looked pleased.
""What can I say? Eric always tells me my cooking beats any restaurant food.
""He said nothing compares to a home-cooked meal.""
Kaylee's smile faltered as she tried to leave.
Pulling her back, I cheerfully recounted all the sweet moments Eric and I shared.
I only stopped when Eric appeared. Walking over to him, I linked our arms and cheerfully suggested finding Kaylee a boyfriend.
She finally broke down and rushed off, hiding her face.
When I noticed Eric getting ready to follow her, I faked twisting my ankle.
""Ouch! It hurts.""
Eric quickly helped me sit down and turned to fetch some ice.
I grabbed his hand to stop him and asked him to massage my foot instead.
I knew he planned to use getting ice as an excuse to comfort his lover, but I wouldn't allow it.
After Eric rubbed my ankle, I kept asking him to do various things and only left feeling satisfied after several hours.
In the corridor, I used a damp cloth to clean everywhere Eric had touched me. That was when I overheard a heated argument.
""Are you insane? How could you approach me here at work?""
""Yes, I'm insane. I'm crazy enough to stay with a married man!""
I continued visiting the office daily, bringing Eric his meals and pulling Kaylee aside to share stories about how well he treated me.
Her smile grew more forced each time, and their relationship seemed ready to fall apart.
Since Eric needed both women in his life, he asked me to stop bringing him lunch every day.
I dramatically dropped the ingredients and sobbed about him falling out of love.
I behaved like a needy wife who couldn't live without him, which pleased Eric's ego.
After all, I used to be so independent that he felt intimidated.
Today, while carrying Eric's prepared meal to his office, I ran into Kaylee in the elevator. Unlike recent days, she didn't try to avoid me.
She greeted me with a smile right away. ""Jessica, delivering food again?
""Eric is so lucky to have such a caring wife like you.
""Though if you keep bringing him meals daily, he might eventually get bored with it.""
I kept my expression neutral and continued smiling while responding to her comments.
I stayed cautious, wondering what prompted her to say that.
As we left the elevator, Kaylee unconsciously touched her belly.
Could she be expecting a baby?

Chapter 5
In my previous life, I had only a daughter. Eric used to claim that having a boy or a girl made no difference.
But deep down, he never truly valued our daughter, even after my death.
I helplessly witnessed how they confined Cecilia indoors and barely fed her.
She would only receive scraps when she allowed their son to use her as a riding toy.
The rage building inside me felt like molten lava threatening to burst free.
After calming myself, I smiled and put on my loving wife's act again.
As expected, when I walked into his office, Eric said, ""Honey, you've put in so much effort cooking. I'll just order delivery food at work from now on.""
That wouldn't do. How could restaurant food match the nutritious meals I made to ensure his long life?
I quickly accepted Eric's idea, and I saw him relax with relief.
Then, I added, ""Being home alone is so dull. Maybe I should come to work at the company.""
Eric immediately rejected my suggestion. He needed me away from the office to have more freedom.
""Honey, Cecilia needs you at home.
""Wouldn't it be nice if you could spend time gardening and playing piano?
""Work is exhausting, and I don't want you wearing yourself out.""
His words made my skin crawl, but I kept insisting on working.
When I wouldn't listen to his reasoning, he grew tired of arguing.
He finally agreed to let me continue bringing his daily meals.
I spotted someone moving past the window and smiled inwardly.
My dear friend must have realized this man only cared about himself. He would show affection to whoever benefited him most.
From that point on, Kaylee took an extended leave, claiming illness and needing to return home for medical care.
I didn't buy this story, especially since Eric started coming home increasingly late.
Sometimes, he couldn't even touch the dinner I'd prepared, making excuses about being too full of business dinners.
I hired a private investigator and discovered Kaylee had relocated to an apartment right below ours.
Each evening after work, Eric would visit her place first, spending considerable time there before returning home.
They had scheduled a prenatal appointment together for the following day.
I gripped my food safety manual so tightly that the pages crinkled.
In my previous life, Eric never joined me for any prenatal visits.
Whenever Kaylee faced problems, I foolishly felt sympathy and encouraged Eric to assist her.
How incredibly naive I had been.
The next day, after bringing Eric his meal, I lingered instead of leaving with my thermos.
As their appointment time approached, Eric grew restless.
""Honey, Cecilia will miss you if you don't head home soon.""
""Oh, it's okay. The nanny is watching her.
"" I just want to spend time with you. Don't you want me here?""
Eric awkwardly fell silent and pretended to focus on his work. But his attention kept drifting, and he declined his buzzing phone calls.
He claimed they were spam calls, and I simply smiled.
Anxious people always act busy. Eric grabbed his coffee and drank some.
I sat calmly on the couch, browsing a magazine while time ticked by.
""Honey...""
Before finishing his sentence, Eric's face turned pale, and he rushed to the toilet.
When he emerged with unsteady steps, I approached him with fake concern.
Before he could speak, he waved me off and hurried back to the toilet.
The laxative was working perfectly. I'd gotten it from a veterinarian.
After multiple trips, Eric slumped on the couch, looking deathly pale.
I called my assistant to help Eric to the hospital, ignoring his protests.
There, we encountered Kaylee clutching her prenatal exam results.
""Jessica?"" She spun around quickly, and I spotted the edge of the pregnancy report.
I moved forward and grabbed the document, adding just enough shock to my voice.

1liypyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1liypyx/awful_weekend_and_i_need_to_rant/,Awful weekend and I need to rant,"Hi everyone, I’m autistic in my 20s (diagnosed) and had a pretty emotionally brutal weekend, and I just really need to get this out to people who might understand. It’s hard for me to process and I’m feeling overwhelmed, confused, and kind of crushed.

So, I flew solo for the first time to visit someone I met a month ago during a trip to her country. We hit it off back then — a few hours together, great connection, and we stayed in touch. This was a different city (one I’d never been to before), and she’d invited me to come visit. I was nervous but hopeful.

The whole weekend was a sensory and emotional overload. I wasn’t feeling well — sore throat, couldn’t swallow, but everyone kept saying it was probably just anxiety, so I pushed through.

When I arrived, she was warm and friendly. She made flirty comments, like complimenting my clothes and saying she wore a dress “just for me” and would save it for when she sees me again. I was trying my best to stay grounded — feeling anxious, sick, but trying to follow her cues.

The next day we had what seemed like a great day: walking, museums, shared meals, photos together, laughing — it all felt really good. Then, out of nowhere, on the way back from a coffee shop, I asked (politely) if she wanted to hold hands. She said that’s something she only does when she’s been with someone a long time. I said okay and respected that.

But after that, everything shifted. Suddenly, she started saying she wanted to “take things slow.” I said I was fine with that — I wasn’t trying to define anything too fast. I did say that if she didn’t see any future between us, that was up to her. She seemed distant, and I had to keep up with her walking. It felt like she was trying to create distance physically and emotionally.

We got on a train and sat opposite each other in complete silence. I tried making a few light jokes — nothing landed. I even offered to move seats if that would help her feel better, which I did. When it was my stop, I just said “hope it goes well for you tonight” and got off. I didn’t look back, though it hurt like hell.

The next day — radio silence. All plans canceled. I wandered around the city alone, sick full of cold and anxious, trying to keep it together. Eventually, I got a text “friendzoning” me,. I politely declined being friends later in the day, and then somehow the blame shifted onto me — that I had wrong expectations and made her feel pressured to jump into this hyead first, even though I asked up front if she was single and she invited me.

It felt like everything was going so well… and then it all just flipped, with no warning. The hardest part is I truly don’t understand what happened. It’s like emotional whiplash. One moment we were connecting, the next I felt like I was a burden.

On the way home, I had a panic attack at the airport. I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t calm down. The police had to help me get to an autism-friendly quiet space. I eventually made it home, but I’m struggling. I feel confused, like I missed a ton of social cues or misunderstood everything. I’m questioning whether I was at fault, or if I just trusted the wrong person.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? How do you deal with that kind of abrupt shift and confusion when everything seemed to be going well? I feel raw, disoriented, and like I can’t make sense of it.

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I really appreciate it.

1liymx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eutychus/comments/1liymx5/factcheck_frequently_asked_questions_about/,"Fact-check - Frequently Asked Questions About Jehovah’s Witnesses – Part 3. ""Meetings and Worship"" and ""View of the Bible""","Let's continue.

Today's topics are ""Meetings and Worship"" and ""View of the Bible."" Interestingly, some topics are mentioned again here, which is why I have combined these two topics to avoid unnecessary repetition.

# 1. Why Don’t Jehovah’s Witnesses Call Their Meeting Place a Church?

**Their Answer:** ""In the Bible, the Greek term that is sometimes translated “church” refers to a group of worshippers, not to the building they meet in.""

**Fact:** Completely correct. It actually annoys me a lot that many people associate a church with a building and not with the congregation that worships the living God in it! A ""church"" is *not* a building; it is the living congregation of Christ on earth! The building as such is generally speaking a temple, in the Christian sense either a chapel or a cathedral (also known as a *Dom*) or something similar, and very plainly, a church building. Moreover, it is only partially true that the early Christians met in houses. While that is also true, to my knowledge, church buildings in the narrower sense, especially rather modest small ones, already existed in the 2nd century AD, including in Syria. And as for the name Kingdom Hall? Well, you can do that. It's neither right nor wrong, but a matter of taste. Personally, I would prefer 'Church Hall'.

**Conclusion:** Historically and biblically correct.

# 2. Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Observe the Lord’s Supper Differently From the Way Other Religions Do?

**Their Answer:** ""We adhere strictly to the Bible in our observance of the Lord’s Evening Meal, which is also known as “the Lord’s supper,” the Last Supper, and the Memorial of Jesus’ death. (1 Corinthians 11:20; *King James Version*) In contrast, many beliefs and practices of other denominations in connection with this observance are not based on the Bible.""

**Fact:** Oh dear. Another classic. Here too, I have to address the facts once again, for better or for worse. So: When Catholics speak of incense and the like, they mean this in cultural reference to Old or New Testament things that did indeed exist accurately in the biblical context of the time. The Witnesses, on the other hand, are rather Waldensian-Protestant and Restorationist in that situation and want to *categorically* avoid everything that is not directly mentioned by name in the context of the Last Supper. As already mentioned: The rejection of incense and co. is not a unique feature of the Witnesses but can also be found in many Protestant groups. 

Now to the actual core: No, I am not going into this 144,000 issue. The Witnesses' point here is that Jesus performed the new covenant and the breaking of the bread and drinking of the blood with his 12 closest followers in private and *not* as a large public ceremony with the participation of hundreds of thousands, as was quite common in Babylonian or Roman ruler cults at the time. Is this accurate now? That can be debated. To my knowledge, the partaking of the blood and bread was historically perceived very early as a central element by the mass of Christians, obviously prepared by the eldest members. A ""separation"" of the believers in this form is thus not so known to me historically. However, the early Christian groups of the martyr era were also not a mass phenomenon but a small group of particularly zealous and fearless worshippers of God and not a ""live show"" with hundreds of thousands of spectators as is practiced in some stadiums today.

**Conclusion:** This cannot really be categorized clearly. The rejection of Catholic symbolism is, of course, possible; the separation of the partakers into two groups is historically difficult. The general ""interval"" of the Lord's Supper is completely irrelevant, and that goes for both sides. It is a deeply spiritual and central ritual for Christians and not a coffee klatch. The Witnesses are correct in that regular, short-term participation does lead to a very disadvantageous habituation effect. Whether the solution is to do it only once a year or not should be left up to each individual. 

Important: No, the Lord's Supper is *not* a circus event! There is no jumping around or playing baseball! And that applies in both the figurative and the literal sense! Anyone who seriously complains that the Lord's Supper is not ""action-packed"" enough should kindly not waste the other participants' air and go to the movies instead! The Lord's Supper is first and foremost devotion, then appreciation, and only *then* active participation!

# 3. Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Have Their Own Bible?

**Their Answer:** ""Jehovah’s Witnesses have used many different translations in their study of the Bible. In languages where it is available, though, we especially appreciate the *New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures* for its use of God’s name, for its accuracy, and for its clarity.""

**Fact:** Correct. I don't need to say much about this. It annoys me at least as much when this never-ending fairy tale of the eternal NWT-Witnesses is chewed over again and again. Jehovah's Witnesses were not founded on the basis of the NWT but on the King James! In the German-speaking world, the very accurate *Elberfelder Bibel* of the local Plymouth Brethren was used, and many translations are still in the glass cabinet in the Kingdom Hall today or in translation apps on the smartphones of missionary Jehovah's Witnesses themselves. The fairy tale that the Witnesses are limited to the NWT alone is preposterous nonsense; they use it mainly because of the consistent use of God's name as Jehovah, which other common translations simply do not do, and *not* because of some obscure conspiracy theory!

**Conclusion:** Completely correct.

# 4. Is the New World Translation Accurate?

**Their Answer:** No direct answer is given here, but rather some differences to other common translations, positive comments from other Christian scholars on the NWT, and other information.

**Fact:** The NWT is an absolutely fully functional and accurate translation. No, I will not go into John 1:1 here either. I also won't go into the concept that the Greek original text has neither commas nor capitalization and that the ""playing field"" (e.g., the criminal on the cross and his entry into Paradise) is therefore still open. For things like ""worship"" in the Jesus context, please see the corresponding threads. The absence of the Apocrypha is not an exclusion criterion because it is not really taken seriously even by most mainstream Christians; even Luther placed it *clearly* below the otherwise established scriptural canon. In contrast to some ancient translations, the NWT, like many others, strives to keep out known interpolations such as the famous and notorious story of Jesus and the adulteress because, according to almost complete scholarly consensus, they are not considered originally secured or transmitted in the scriptural canon.

**Conclusion:** Correct.

# Final Observation:

Here too, it becomes clear that the majority of the statements officially made by Jehovah's Witnesses are indeed correct. The NWT is certainly not the very best translation in the world, as some patriotic Witnesses like to claim, but at its core, it is an absolutely functional, serious translation alternative to common classics like the NASB or the King James. Regarding the Last Supper: Here, one can certainly also take more controversial positions without having to be considered a demonic ""seducer.""",1,1750729226.0,Eutychus,0,1.0,False

1liylp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1liylp4/i_25f_need_help_processing_what_happened_last/,I [25F] need help processing what happened last night at this seemingly casual reunion with friends [25F] [26M] [76M].,"I've been in a LDR for more than 6 years and will be moving to my partner's country in over a month. This year I met someone with whom I have friends in common; he (let's call him ""S"" [26M]) thought I was cool to talk to, got my number, chatted occasionally and invited me out on friendly plans. He then started texting me daily and I enjoyed it way too much, which gave me a huge sense of guilt in spite of knowing my limits and never letting conversations or actions go to compromising levels. 

One day, we ran into each other at a mall (he somehow finds me everywhere but I think it's because my city is rather small). He invited me for a coffee, I accepted. Then a peculiar friend of his joined us (a german old man, let's call him ""C"" [76M]), it was quite a weird experience but I enjoyed most of it except for the parts in which C talked about sex, freedom in love, open relationships and suggested for me to get more than one boyfriend (I don't even feel comfortable talking about that with close friends). For the record, S had to translate everything C said to me because C does not speak my language.

Last friday I went out with my best friend (Let's call her ""K"" [25F]). I wanted us to go to a play we had planned to see together and then drink some alcohol and talk about life, my worries about moving out and also my mixed feelings about S. Once we went out of the play she suddenly said ""S is in this place, let's go there"". I did not have the courage to say no so I let her drag me. Once there we continued drinking but I got upset and tired so I did not participate much in the conversation. By the end of the night, S said something completely out of the blue that got me very weirded out and made me feel incredibly vulnerable. He said to me ""I still cannot believe you didnt realize that throughout the whole night C was telling us you and I should go fuck"". I looked at him and could only say ""how did you want me to know? He speaks german"". The way he said it though, so lightly and almost as if it was a joke. It felt very insulting.

Last Saturday. Although I was feeling very uncomfortable in S presence, we had scheduled a dinner at C's house months ago and even before I met him. I was hesitant about going but I decided to fulfill my commitment.

At the beginning of the dinner, everything was fine. Calm. Normal. We arrived and C showed us his house and his art (he is dedicated to painting and sculpting). Then we had dinner, talked for a while and started drinking.

Later, C brought out his guitar and started playing. He told me to sing, to raise my voice and stop being so introverted (which I am, I know). I began to feel that he had developed a fixation on me. I became especially aware of this when K said something like ""tell this to C"" and I replied, ""why don't you tell him yourself?"" And she responded, ""because he's obsessed with you."" This made me feel a mix of discomfort, pride, and vanity. I usually don’t seek to be the center of interest, and even less so from a 76-year-old man; however, receiving all that attention was flattering.

After the guitar session, C began to have a lot of physical contact with me. I HATE unnecessary physical contact; I am not someone who hugs, kisses, or even simply touches other people unless they are my partner. C touched my arm, saying I was very skinny (he even asked my weight), took my hand, compared it to his, and told me he liked it and he also put one of his rings on my finger. It seemed like he wanted to have physical contact with me at every opportunity.

Then, K thought it would be a good idea to tell C (when he started talking about religion) that I was extremely Catholic and got offended when people said God didn’t exist (which is not true). After this, C’s fixation on me increased, and he started saying things like, ""but why do you believe that?"" ""You are very intelligent; you are capable of thinking, think!"". They kept teasing me about religion, and I felt a bit uncomfortable again because C was too insistent on me.

Anyway, C talked about Muslims, then his dislike for beards and finally, he somehow connected it all to the topic of male and female hormones, and therefore, delved into the topic of genitals, which made me extremely uncomfortable (but made K and S laugh). So when he made very explicit comments, I would cover my face with a pillow. When he noticed this, C would take the pillow away and say, ""but this is normal; you are a woman, you have a v*gina. He is a man (pointing to S), he has a p*nis.""

Then came the part that made me the most uncomfortable. C asked S something in German, and S laughed a lot and said he wouldn’t translate it. After insisting, S said: ""Okay, I will translate what he asked me but not my answer, with the condition that you (meaning me) won’t feel uncomfortable."" I told him that I was already feeling uncomfortable, so it probably wouldn’t make a difference. Unfortunately, it did make a difference. What C asked was, ""S, which of the two (K or me) would you like to sleep with?"" Once he said that, I felt my stomach twist. Obviously, it seemed inappropriate, but I felt even worse thinking that S DID ANSWER HIM. That left me very perplexed, and intrigued about not knowing whom he had chosen. A part of me wanted it to have been me; I suppose it was because of ego and the feeling of being desired. Another part of me tried not to dwell on it (but I did dwell on it a lot).

After that, we went down from the terrace. C invited me to go down before everyone else and did so with a bow, as if I were royalty. He extended his hand to me, and I hesitated for a second whether to take it or not. He insisted, I took it, he squeezed it hard, and dragged me toward where he was going. It seemed like he only had eyes for me, and K and S noticed, so they decided to take the dishes and things from the terrace to the kitchen while C showed me his paintings all over the house. He tried to explain them to me in very basic Spanish (my native language), asked me what I thought of them, guided me to the next piece he wanted to show me by taking me by the shoulders and brusquely steering me, and sought my eye contact. Since S and K left me alone, I felt very vulnerable and even became afraid that this man might try to do something to me. He didn’t, fortunately. His house has four floors, so it was a very long tour.

At one point, I had a strange feeling. I thought: what are K and S doing alone in the kitchen? Was this C’s plan because S’s answer to his question had been ""K""? This unsettled me and caused a feeling of jealousy, which I know is unfounded since I have nothing with S and don’t want to. Maybe it was the thought that I was not his center of attention. How stupid of me, right?

Anyway. C took me to the first floor, his workshop. After this, K and S joined us again. C asked me if I painted, and I told him no, so he kept insisting that I try new things, express myself, and stop being so introverted (I feel this perception came from the way I reacted to uncomfortable comments, I suppose). He gifter me two of his paintings and finally, I sat down in his workshop and started to fall asleep in the chair. That marked the time to leave. K ordered an Uber that arrived very quickly. I tried to order one to my house, but it took an eternity. When K got in the car and left, it was just S, C, and me at the door (standing in that order too). That was when C said, ""You are going to leave with S, right? You are going together, right? You are going to be together tonight?"" And as he said this, he took me by the arm and brusquely tried to push me toward S. I repeatedly told him no and tried to pull away.

Since I couldn't get an Uber, S said I should go with him in his taxi, that they would take me home first and then he would go to his house. I accepted. I was very sleepy and drunk. C took me by the arm again and then roughly dragged me to another area of his porch to wait for the taxi. S was far away, and at that moment, C asked me, ""Are you and S going to have sex tonight?"" I told him no; he insisted on asking why; I just replied no, visibly uncomfortable. Then he asked, ""Don't you like him?"" And I told him no, even though, deep down, I won’t deny it, I am physically and intellectually attracted to him, and in an alternate reality, under different conditions and contexts, I would have liked the freedom to spend the night with him. That is just a thought (which confuses me even more and makes me feel very guilty); I would NEVER act on it. I do not intend to make that mistake.

The taxi arrived, we said goodbye, and left. S and I didn't talk much during the ride. Suddenly, I remembered all the times I've been minimized or violated in my life, which gave me the motivation to talk about my boundaries. On the way, I said to S, ""Can I ask you something?"" He said, ""Of course, tell me."" ""Why did you decide to tell me yesterday at the bar and in front of K what you hadn’t wanted to translate from C last Saturday?"". ""I don't know, I had no specific reason, it just occurred to me. Honestly, I don’t know why C started saying those things; he had never been like that with those topics. I know I can't apologize for him, but I apologize anyway"". ""I understand; however, it seemed a bit unnecessary for you to tell me anyway"". ""Did you feel uncomfortable?"". ""A lot."" ""I'm sorry. I want you to know that those are not my intentions with you"". ""It's okay; you don't have to apologize for him because you are you, and he is he. However, even though he is from a different culture and of advanced age, that doesn’t lessen the discomfort he made me feel and that I also felt when you translated what he said the other day in such an unnecessary way."" ""I'm sorry. I just thought about saying it. Also, I was very drunk since I started drinking at 2 p.m. yesterday. But I want you to know that those are not my intentions with you"". ""It's okay, thanks,"" I finally responded. I got out of the car and arrived home. After all that, he mostly sent me unrelated text messages and also said ""thank you for being brave enough to confront me and telling me all that yesterday"". That's all.

But ultimately: what’s so different between top L and middle L that i love one and dislike the other?  They all seem like sharp rectangular hunks of wood to me, but the middle row feels too rigid/formal for my taste.

On the bottom row I did a similar experiment with curves to balance the squared arm/rigid back couch. For some reason the R ovals seem like and awkward pairing but I love the L round. I didn’t include all the experiments, but I accounted for color and that’s not it.

New poster here. I recently have gotten into coffee and managed to get an old used coffee machine from a friend who didn't use it in a year. It's nothing special, just a Fabreware espresso machine. I am planning to use it for some time to get into espresso brewing (I only used an AeroPress thus far). 

Now, this machine I got had some rust build-up on the inside (where the filter locks). I managed to clean it with vinegar and also descaled the machine a couple of times using a 4:1 water-to-white-vinegar solution. When running water through the machine, it initially came out quite cloudy, but after a couple of rounds of descaling and flushing with water, it seems to be better (still a bit cloudy, though). 

Any tips on how best to clean the machine to ensure the coffee is safe to drink? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",3,1750728265.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

I swear, I almost kissed him right there. All because I was the long–lost real daughter of the Miller family.","**Chapter 1**

The doctor told me I had late–stage pancreatic cancer. I swear, I almost kissed him right there. All because I was the long–lost real daughter of the Miller family.

But on my wedding day, the adopted daughter, Sarah, jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.

Just like that, Sarah became the family’s precious angel, and I, the actual flesh and blood, became the villain who killed her.

My parents cursed the day I was born, wishing it had been me who died. My brother, Tom, forced me to kneel at Sarah’s grave and beg for forgiveness.

Even my husband, Nick, would get caught up in the moment and call out her name when we were intimate. Turns out, family and bloodlines don’t mean a thing.

I was always going to be the outsider. The doctor’s voice snapped me back.

“Ms. Miller, you have about a month left.”

Well, isn’t that just perfect? You guys finally won’t have to look at me anymore, and I’m finally free. But why are you all crying?

I went straight to my parents‘ house from the hospital. Since I was kicking the bucket soon, I figured I should grab whatever was rightfully mine before it was too late.

But when I walked in, I saw my mom sobbing on the couch, and my dad patting her back, trying to comfort her. The second he saw me, his comforting act turned into a look of pure disgust.

“What are you doing here? Did you come to make us miserable?”

“You know today’s Sarah’s birthday. Did you come back just to ruin it?”

“Laura, I can’t believe your mother and I raised you to be such a terrible person! So spiteful and ungrateful!”

Hearing his words, I finally understood why Mom was crying. It was Sarah’s birthday, huh? What did that have to do with me? I looked at them.

“I’m just here to pick up a few things. I’ll be out of your hair soon.”

Mom grabbed a mug off the coffee table and threw it at me, her voice full of hatred.

“Didn’t you hear your father? It’s your sister’s birthday! Don’t you have anything to say to her?”

“It’s been two years, two whole years! You drove her to her death, and you stand there like nothing happened!”

“I wish you were the one who was gone! Why did you have to come back? Bring my Sarah back to me! Give her back!”

The mug slammed into my forehead. In seconds, warm blood was trickling down my face. Dad wrapped his arms around Mom, who was getting hysterical.

“Just grab your stuff and go. Don’t upset your mother any more than you already have.”

I wiped the blood off my face, feeling nothing but contempt. My existence was a trigger for my own mother?

When I was four, Mom took me to Disneyland, and somehow lost me.

I wasn’t found and brought back to the Miller’s until three years ago, when I was twenty–two. I still remember that day vividly.

I stood awkwardly in this massive, fancy living room. Sarah was sitting on the couch, dressed like she’d been pampered her whole life. Even her hair looked perfect.

Seeing me staring at Sarah, Dad nervously explained, “Laura, this is your sister, Sarah.”

“After you disappeared, your mother couldn’t eat or sleep. She cried every day, looking for you for six months. We couldn’t find you anywhere, so we adopted Sarah from the orphanage.”

“If it weren’t for Sarah, your mother probably wouldn’t be alive today. But now you’re back, and we’re finally a family again.”

Before I could say anything, Sarah’s eyes filled with tears, and she said, choking back sobs, “Laura, do you not like me? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to take your place.”

She looked at Mom and Dad. “Mom and Dad, as much as I love you, I can’t be the Miller’s daughter anymore, now that Laura’s come home.”

“I don’t want to ruin your relationship with Laura.”

“Thank you for taking care of me all these years. I was an unwanted orphan, and the eighteen years I stole from Laura were enough for a lifetime.

**Chapter 2**

Of course, Sarah stayed. She was more like a Miller than I ever could be. Now she’s dead, and the whole family worships her.

My existence was too much for my own family. I didn’t look at Mom and Dad. I just went upstairs to Tom’s room and knocked. Since it was Sarah’s birthday, Tom would be home.

He frowned when he saw me, his eyes filled with the same disgust as Mom and Dad.

“What do you want? Did you come to gloat about driving Sarah to her death? Did you come back to rub it in?”

I ignored his insults and walked into his room, opening the bottom drawer of his desk. He noticed what I was doing and grabbed my arm.

“What are you doing?”

I didn’t answer, just shook him off and started taking out the envelopes from the drawer, one by one. I laughed bitterly as I did. He hadn’t opened a single one.

When I came back to this family, Mom and Dad gave me a credit card and told me to buy some new clothes and stuff.

But I knew Tom collected stamps, so I saved the money and bought all sorts of rare stamps.

I was four when I got lost, so my memories of before that were hazy, but I always remembered my brother.

When we were kids, Mom and Dad wouldn’t let me eat candy to keep my teeth healthy. But Tom would always find a way to sneak me a Tootsie Roll or two.

He’d wait until Mom and Dad were asleep and slip it under my door. During the eighteen years I couldn’t go home, the taste of those candy was all that kept me going.

But when I finally came home, my brother became Sarah’s brother. Tom looked annoyed every time I gave him an envelope.

“Can you stop? Why do you keep writing me letters? Can’t you just say whatever you want. Stop trying to be sentimental. You’ll just make Sarah feel insecure. She already feels bad enough that you’re home.”

“And what are you wearing? Mom and Dad gave you money for new clothes. Why are you still wearing those rags? Are you trying to get attention?”

Every time, he’d throw the envelope in the bottom drawer, like it was contaminating him. Seeing what I was doing, Tom snatched the envelopes from my hands.

“What are you doing with this garbage? Are you trying to play games with your own brother?”

I stood up and looked him in the eye. “Taking out the trash.”

Tom was speechless, staring at me. He scoffed, throwing the stack of envelopes in the trash can.

“Garbage belongs in the trash. Don’t worry about cleaning up after me.”

I stared at the envelopes in the trash can, the envelopes that had never been opened, and I couldn’t help but feel a lump in my throat.

Maybe I shouldn’t have come back three years ago. Eighteen years was too long, and it had erased even blood ties.

Sarah was their family. Mom, Dad, and Tom had no room for me. I didn’t belong in their family**.**

Like these stamps, they’d been thrown away without even being looked at because I was the one who had given them. I swallowed my emotions and looked at Tom.

“Just as long as you don’t have to look at them again.”

Then I left. Or me, I added silently. Brother, you won’t have to look at me again, either.

**Chapter 3**

It was dark when I got home. Usually the house was all lit up. Even when Nick wasn’t home, the housekeeper, Maria, would turn on all the lights.

I walked in and turned on the lights in the living room. There was my husband, Nick, sitting at the dining table. In the center of the table was a birthday cake with candles.

Nick quickly wiped his face. His eyes were red. It hit me. Nick was celebrating Sarah’s birthday.

I wanted to laugh. Today was the day I found out I had terminal pancreatic cancer, and my parents, my brother, and my husband were all thinking about someone else.

Nick looked annoyed to see me. Probably because I was interrupting his remembrance of his perfect angel.

“I thought the driver said you went to your parents‘ house. Why are you back?”

I gave a bitter laugh and handed Maria my coat.

“My parents‘ house? Do I have a real home?”

I’d been at the hospital all day, and I was exhausted. I didn’t want to talk to Nick. I just wanted to go to bed. But he wasn’t going to let me go.

Just as I was about to open the bedroom door, he said, “Don’t you have something you want to say today?”

Best gifts for your loved ones

I laughed at Nick’s words and turned to face him.

“What should I say? What do you want me to say?”

“You want me to get on my knees and beg for forgiveness. You want me to cry and wail, and slap myself. That’s still not enough. You want me to die, right?”

I was being rude, but I was angry, and he deserved it He grabbed my chin, making me look him in the eye.

“Laura, do you even have a heart? Don’t you know why Sarah killed herself?”

“What? Are you showing your true colors now? You can’t keep up the act anymore? You’re disgusting!”

“You’re right, you should die. You should give Sarah her life back. Your worthless life isn’t worth a fraction of Sarah’s!”

Nick looked like he did the first time I met him. It made me feel dizzy. Three years ago, when I first came to this family, I felt like I was walking on eggshells because of Sarah.

I was so afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. I didn’t want to make Sarah cry, or upset Mom, Dad, or Tom.

Everyone was so worried about Sarah that they didn’t notice how awkward I felt. Nick was the only one who saw it. He saw my embarrassment, my carefulness, my sadness.

When I hid and cried, he was always the first one to find me. He told me that it wasn’t my fault.

During that first year with the Millers, Nick was the only good thing in my life.

So when Dad told me that the Millers and the Andersons were planning a marriage and asked if I was willing, I agreed, terrified of losing that warmth.

But on the day Nick and I got married, Sarah jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge.

Nick choked me, yelling, “It’s all your fault! Why did you have to come back!”

“You stole her parents, her brother, and now her husband!”

“You finally got what you wanted! You drove her to her death!”

At that moment, I realized that if I hadn’t come back, Sarah would’ve married Nick. Nick was supposed to be Sarah’s husband.

When Sarah jumped off that bridge, I lost the only person in the world who was on my side.

How could a living piece of trash ever compare to a dead angel?

I couldn’t breathe, and everything was getting blurry.

Then Maria screamed, “Sir, let go of her! You’re killing her!”

I gasped for air, choking. Nick scoffed, his voice as cold as the snow outside.

“Can’t breathe? Suffocating? What about Sarah? How hopeless did she have to be to jump into the ocean?”

“Laura, everything you have, you stole. You stole Sarah’s life! Don’t act like you’re the victim here. I don’t believe your tricks. They’re disgusting.”

My throat was killing me, but I looked up at Nick.

“You’re more disgusting than Mom, Dad, and Tom. At least they’re honest. You’re just a coward.”

“They didn’t try to hide that they favored Sarah. What about you?”

“If Sarah meant so much to you, why didn’t you say something? Why didn’t you tell your parents that you loved Sarah?”

Nick’s face turned white. I laughed at his expression.

“Did I hit a nerve? Are you admitting that you’re a coward?”

“You’re just trying to blame a woman. The Andersons were the ones who wanted to marry the Miller’s real daughter. Now that Sarah’s dead, you’re pretending to be heartbroken?”

“You’re a coward, Nick. You’re a coward who blames women for his problems.”

Nick raised his hand to hit me. I just looked at him, smirking. His hand fell to his side.

“You’re sick. You’re saying crazy things. Go to bed.”

“It’s Grandpa’s birthday soon. We have to go to the Anderson’s mansion. Get ready.”

Nick left. I smiled bitterly. Sick? Crazy? Okay, I’m sick. But I wasn’t saying crazy things. I was just telling the truth.

I used to blame myself for Sarah’s death. I put up with the anger and the accusations.

But I’m dying too. Now that we’re both going to be dead, I’m not going to give her an advantage.

Nick didn’t come home for the next few days. I was actually grateful for the peace and quiet. On the day of Grandpa Anderson’s birthday, Nick came to pick me up.

I had to admit, even though the Millers and Nick treated me like dirt, Grandpa Anderson was always good to me.

He really treated me like his granddaughter–in–law. When we got to the Anderson’s mansion, there were a lot of guests.

The Millers were there too.

When they saw me, everyone started whispering.

“Is that the Miller’s daughter with Nick? She looks different than I remember.”

“You haven’t been around in years. That’s the Miller’s real daughter, Laura. She came back three years ago. Sarah was the adopted daughter.”

“Didn’t you hear? This Laura is bad news. She came back and stole Sarah’s marriage and drove her to suicide. She’s something else.”

I looked at the person who said I drove Sarah to suicide and smiled.

“I don’t know where you got the idea that I stole anything. The Andersons and the Millers planned the marriage. Nick is the Anderson’s only son, and I’m the Miller’s only daughter. Who did I steal from?”

“And as for driving her to suicide, that’s ridiculous. I came home, but I didn’t force her to move out or kill herself. How did I drive her to suicide?”

“Everyone here is important, so please, don’t act like a gossiping housewife.”

I said it softly, but everyone could hear me. No one dared to speak. Mom snapped. She walked up to me and slapped me.

“You ungrateful brat! What are you talking about!”

“Sarah is dead! She’s dead! You have everything now, and you’re still talking about her!”

“Why did I have to give birth to you? Give me Sarah back!”

Tom helped Mom and glared at me. “Laura, you’re a terrible person!

I was on the ground, looking up at them. Dad, Mom, Tom, Husband. They were my family, but they weren’t. Then a woman’s voice said, “Mom! Dad! Tom! I’m back!”

“Sarah’s back!........

It was, at least to me, a really loving, committed relationship. We lived together, talked about marriage and kids, and even people around us — friends, strangers — would often comment on how in love and solid we seemed.

The relationship wasn’t perfect, of course. I struggled with some insecurities, partly from past betrayal in another relationship. One of the points of tension was that he stayed loosely in contact with an ex which he did not proactively share with me and had planned a trip near where she lived. I voiced my discomfort, but he told me he needed independence and space sometimes — though in reality, he rarely acted on that.

A few months before the breakup, I found out he was on antidepressants and hadn’t told me, which hurt because it reinforced this feeling that he kept parts of himself walled off. I now understand he struggles with anxiety and chronic back/neck pain, but at the time, it made me feel disconnected and shut out.

Despite these challenges, I thought we were working through things. He even wrote me a card saying it had been the happiest year of his life just months before everything fell apart.

The actual breakup blindsided me completely. I was away on a short work trip, and while I was gone, he texted me constantly saying how much he missed me, loved me, and how hard it was without me at home. When I got back on a Friday, everything felt totally normal — we made dinner together, cuddled on the couch, it felt like us.

But the next morning, I woke up and went to the kitchen to make coffee, and found him sitting there with his head in his hands, crying. My first thought was his chronic back pain — I immediately assumed something physical was wrong. But instead, he told me he was unhappy, that the relationship was making him feel that way, that he was losing his sense of identity, and he needed clarity. Within hours, he packed up every single one of his belongings from our home and left.

To make matters worse, I had financially supported him for months while he was unemployed — covering rent, trips, dinners, etc. After the breakup, I asked him to contribute toward what he owed, and he ghosted me. Eventually, his parents sent me a check with a note implying I was “harassing” him by asking for what I was owed — all without him speaking to me directly.

I’ve since found out from his mom that he’s heartbroken too, but his actions have been cold, avoidant, and — frankly — cruel. He never even wished me happy birthday or acknowledged the pain he caused. He’s been completely silent ever since the financial dispute, despite how close we were.

The whole thing has left me blindsided, heartbroken, and questioning my own reality. I’ve been trying to understand — is this just classic avoidant behavior? Did I push him away? Was this always destined to unravel? How do people walk away so easily from something that felt so real?

I know I have healing to do, but the way it ended feels like emotional whiplash, and I’m struggling to make sense of it.",1,1750728107.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Straight friend ignores me after initiating the s3x,"I posted here before. But I still need advice. So flashback: My super close straight friend (as in with fiance and kid) who is also a top ranking boss (Im his junior) had sex with me during one of our trips abroad. 6 years kami magkaibigan, pero walang show of interest. Kaya nagulat ako he made the first move (after I said no like 4 times but I gave in eventually). We were under cannabis influence (legal where we were) that time, which he offered. Even before this, touchy and flirty na sya but I just thought of it as a joke kasi close kami. But I have always been careful in replying non-sexual combacks sa flirting nya kasi alam ko minebomb to, now lang ako sumablay. Yo be clear, I gave in din kasi natakot na ko since as a boss with so much power kahit sa global office, pag di ko nagawa to baka ano pa mangyari so wtf just get it over with. 

Morning after di kami mashado nagusap kasi may kanya kanya lakad. That went for 3 days. Pero last day gumala pa kami, masahe ganyan, and banggit pa sya ng banggit na un arms nya daw buff pa rin kahit di nagigym and he kept playing with his chest or showing his tummy. So I thought okay na, kasi if he is awkward, why would he peacock like that. So I thought back to normal.

Now back at work na, he ignores me. Well not ignore but cold, doesnt directly talk to me, I invite him for lunch or offer a coffee break pero puro reject. Super sakit.

It hurts so much because it feels I lost a friend. And it seems di nga sya bothered. I wanted to talk about what happened pero Im not sure how it will turn out. Does he even wanna talk? I just wanna clear the air that sana wala magbago. Or naisip ko another option is to pretend I am okay and try to break the ice by being my usual self, pero Im in so much pain.

But maybe kasi this is too heavy for him kaya I understand (being a boss, and recognizing himself as straight, in a relationship). I understand that. Pero also di man lang nya naisip na magcheck in din sakin since he made the first move.

I dont know what to do. Super painful mawalan ng kaibigan. Complicit din ako na may mali ako why ako nagyes eventually, partly kasi I thought pag nirejrct ko pa mas lalo lumala. 

Right now Im planning to see a therapist and maybe soon magreresign ako pag di ko kinaya un pangs na nafifeel ko. 

May ganto ba nakaexperience sa inyo? How did it end? How did you cope sa pain kasi Im going into full depression mode and nagkakathoughts na ko ng di rational. Im going to see a therapist too so hope that helps

It was my eighteenth birthday, and my father gave me no choice but to flee. Five different cities, all of which had ended with my brother’s and father tracking me down and almost catching me. This time I was able to secure a shitty apartment in an awful neighborhood quickly. It has four walls, a roof, a floor and a lockable door and that was all I needed right now. It's a much better position than I'd be in any other time I had to restart. I've slept on park benches and eaten out of bins. I've begged for change on the streets just to get by. I was making progress finally having a small place to crawl back to at the end of each shitty day. Id grown to liking this city, but nothing ever lasts long.



I had to get the first bus out of there after I spotted my brother’s standing by the car I’d bought out the front of the motel I had been staying at. It was a stupid mistake on my part thinking I could have a car in my name without them tracking it to my location. I was meant to be doing a shift at Thrive that evening. A strip club where I’d landed a job dancing and occasionally bartending. Instead, I walked out that morning to find my father’s pride and joys leaning against my car so casually waiting for me to admit defeat and hand myself over to them. Of course, I did no such thing and took off running before they could see me.



I ran forty minutes to Thrive, which painfully would have taken me only 15 minutes in the car. The whole reason I wanted the stupid liability in the first place. I just needed to get my last paycheck before I skipped town, so I had something this time around to start with. By the time I got there my feet were a mess from running barefoot. Usually, I would have carried my death trap high heels to the car and put them on once I’d clocked in, but I didn’t have that luxury this time.



I’d gotten there late for my shift and a complete mess, but thankfully the manager, Stacy took one look at me and knew something was wrong. I hadn’t told her anything too personal before, but she knew I was in a bad position when I’d first stumbled into the bar asking for a job. I had oversized filthy clothes and a serious matte in my hair from not owning a brush. My shoes were falling apart, and I was so skinny at the time. She took pity on me saying that we’d all been there once and everyone deserved a chance. She taught me how to dance, gave me some of her old outfits and let me crash on her couch for a while once she learned id had nowhere to go. Later she helped me secure a place of my own at the back of a motel and I had saved up enough for a cheap, shitty car. Things were going to well, until my past came back to bite me in the ass.



When I came stumbling into Thrive that night apologizing for being late, Stacy just silently pointed me to her office.



“I’m sorry I’m late, I can’t do my shift either…I just need the weeks pay and I’ve got to go” I said.



“Look darling, I’ve never pried before and I’m not going to start now. I can see you’ve been through some shit and you were in a real bad way when you first got to town so as your friend I’ve got to ask, where are you going to go?”



I took a long breath before saying, “I don’t know”.



“And how are you going to get there?”



“…I don’t know, a bus maybe?”



“And where will you be staying?”



“I don’t know! Look Stacy I appreciate everything you’ve done for me, but this is really time sensitive. I just need the pay, and I need to go.”



“Okay, just slow down love. I get it. I've known runners before. Someone for some reason has found you and you've got to move on, but I can't just let you run off into the wind not knowing anything about where you're going to go. We're friends, okay? I like you and I can help, so I will help. Let me make a phone call to my brother, he owns the club and has plenty of them in different places. We’ll get you transferred to a different club so you can keep earning money, then we’ll sort out a bus ticket and somewhere to stay.”



“You’re not going to ask why I’m leaving?”



“No. In my family, we’re raised not to ask questions we probably don’t want to know the answers to.”



I sat back and waited while Stacy made a phone call to her brother. It seemed like he also didn't ask many questions because it only took a few minutes before she hung up and told me he'd be happy to transfer me immediately and I could start tomorrow. She gave me my weeks' pay, drove me to the bus stop, kissed my cheek goodbye and that was that. It was time to run again. Hopefully her brother is as nice as her.



# Satisfy



It took 8 hours to get here on the bus and by the time I arrived, it was early morning. Id rushed to the club she had me transferred to, Satisfy, so I could fill out some paperwork and get myself on their roster. Thankfully Stacy’s brother had told the manager Kevin that I wouldn’t be going on the payroll and instead I’d be getting cash just like Stacy had been doing for me. It was a relief really; I didn’t need a paper trail, and I didn’t want people asking questions why. Kevin had me put on the roster for that same evening, so I had more than enough time to find the hotel id organized and be able to shower and eat something before my shift started.



“Okay well, welcome to Satisfy! I’m thankful Luciano had you transferred here. We just lost three of our best girls so we’re extremely short staffed now”. He had said. He seemed nice enough. Short, dirty blond hair, medium build and a smile that somehow told me his mother must love him really well.



“Hmmm” I hummed in response. I wanted to be polite but at the same time I didn’t like having to divulge any unnecessary information if I didn’t need to. It was safer that way really.



“Okay great, all the paperwork is done so if you want to meet back here at seven, we can get you sorted out with a wardrobe, have a walkthrough and get you on the stage by eight”.



“A wardrobe? I have a few pieces of my own…”



“Oh no, just come in your own normal clothes, Luciano likes to give each girl their own wardrobe with everything they need.”



“Oh, okay, sure then, I’ll see you at seven... Thanks.”



Luciano was Stacy’s brother, who id learned owned over 20 clubs across the country that he had managed mostly by family, but this one, this one was his. Stacy had told me when she had called him, he was more than happy to have me transferred and needed me to be at the club he managed personally. I thought it was odd at first. Why not send me to any of the others? But I guess if Kevin was saying they were short staffed, that made sense. It was convenient for him.



Id managed my way to the hotel. I had just enough money for a week’s stay, that was if I didn’t spend any of it anywhere else. Which meant that the complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits in my room were going to be the only thing I would be eating for a while. That didn’t bother me too much, my body was used to running on less than what was deemed a normal amount of food. I took one of the sugar packets and sat down on the musty brown comforter on top of the hard bed. I’d have to go slow with what I had supplied so for now I figured a sugar packet would suffice until I’d finished my shift tonight. Maybe then I’d treat myself to one of the four biscuit packets. I tore off the top of the sugar packet, not caring about letting the rubbish fall to the floor. It didn’t look like the place was very clean to begin with, so I didn’t think it really mattered. Letting the sugar fall onto my tongue I let it rest there while it dissolved. A trick id learned from when I was younger, being locked in my room for days on end by my father with no food or water. Occasionally one of the staff that worked in the home would slide something under the door. It had always had to be small enough to fit through the sliver of space. Usually, a squashed piece of bread or candy. I learned quickly to eat little bits over a long period of time and to let it sit on my tongue so I could trick my brain into thinking I had more food than I did.



Shivering off the memory I made my way into the dimly lit bathroom connected to my room. It wasn’t much, but it did come with some soap and shampoo that I knew I desperately needed. I turned on the water and let it steam up before I stepped in, hissing as the water hit the tender spots on my feet from running without shoes. I used all the tiny shampoo that didn’t do much but made my hair feel dry and tangled. The soap was even worse, making my skin feel like rubber, but it did take off the stench id acquired, and I could at least be thankful for that. Hoping out of the shower and using the slightly stained towel to dry off, I used my fingers to comb through the mess of my hair and made my way over to the bag of things I’d managed to get from Thrive before I left. I couldn’t go back and get anything from my motel room there so I would have to make do with a pair of my stripper bottoms and the clothes id already been wearing. I guess it was a good thing Kevin mentioned I’d be getting a wardrobe at the club. Maybe there would be some stuff I could use until I had a bit of cash to buy some secondhand clothes.



It was just after 6 when I’d decided to have another sugar packet before grabbing my purse and leaving for the club. I’d need a little bit of energy to walk there and get the shift done. “Lilly! You’re early” Kevin said as id entered the club’s main doors. The place was still quiet, with just a few staff members looking to be setting up for the night.



“Uh yeah sorry, I didn’t know how long it would take me to get here so I figured it be best to be early rather than late.”



“No that’s fine, we can get started with your wardrobe, meet the other girls and get you ready for tonight if you’d like.”



# Pure, dark, violence



We walked past the bar to the back of the club, Kevin pointing out different things as we went.



“We’ll do a proper walkthrough once we’ve got you set up but this here” he said as he pointed to a keypad by a red door. “This is for the girls only, of course with me and Luciano as an expectation.”



He showed me the pin and we walked into the room. It was much bigger than the changing rooms at Thrive. It has a thick, plush red carpet and black walls. Mirrors and makeup tables lined the walls, and a few girls were already seated and fixing themselves. I’m glad I’m not the only one who likes to be early.



“Hey! Ohhhh is this the new girl you were telling me about Kevin!?”



This blonde barbie looking explosion was bouncing out of her seat and practically skipping her way over in 8-inch pink stilettos. How she was even managing not to break her neck was beyond me. She had on a two piece bright pink leather bra and short shorts. Her breasts looked as though they might bounce up into her face and knock her out. Her platinum blond hair was pulled back into a high ponytail and she had makeup that made her look somewhat innocent if you didn’t look below her shoulders at the rest of her outfit.



“I’m Candy!” she said as she pulled me in for a hug that honestly felt like I should be paying for with how much I could feel her breasts pushing up against me.



“Is that because you’re all sweet and bubbly and shit?” I said before I could even register the blatantly rude tone I was using.



“Ha! Exactly, sweet like Candy and they all want a taste” she said giving me a wink.



“So, what’s your name?”



“Oh sorry, Lilly” I said giving off a half smile.



“Nooo, girly you need a stage name! Lord knows my parents would never have named me Candy. We pick a stage name to protect ourselves from any creepers trying to weasel into our outside lives.”



“Oh, well I don’t have one.”



I didn’t need to tell her Lilly wasn’t even my real name so I never really thought it mattered if I used it in the clubs. If anyone ever tried to find me with that name, they wouldn’t. I made sure of that.



“Didn’t you get transferred here from another club?”



“Yeah?”



“So how did you protect yourself from creeps? What would have happened if someone used your name to say find out where you lived?”



“Oh well if anyone was a ‘creep’ I’d just punch them in the balls, poke my fingers in their eyes or snap their arm or something” I said shrugging my shoulders.



Candys eyes went wide, Kevin visibly stiffened beside me, and I only just realized what I had said was definitely not a normal statement from a 5ft nothing female who was meant to be dainty and seductive.



After what felt like an eternity but was probably just a minute of holding my breath, she laughed, like she really laughed. Bent over, holding her stomach laughing. Wiping a stray tear from her eye before it could ruin her perfectly set face she said, “Okay, so your stage name from here on out will be Violence” she said with a wicked grin.



Yep, I like this girl. After Candy shooed Kevin off, telling him the girls could handle it from here, I met the others and was shown to my own table. It had everything I’d need, all brand-new, high-end products. Candy explained how Luciano made sure every girl here was well taken care of with what they needed to look the part. Then she showed me to the wardrobes which were conveniently placed in between each table along the wall. Each girl got their own walk-in wardrobe that I swear was just as big as my current hotel room. It had the same red carpet and black walls with golden features and floor to ceiling on all four walls were lined with clothes, shoes and accessories. Everything looked new with price tags and after further inspection it was all in my size. From the breast cups down to the shoes.



“Haha, yeah, I looked just like that when I first saw my wardrobe. Everything here is handpicked for you, usually by Kevin, he has excellent taste and a way of reading what a girl’s style is.”



“Kevin picked all this out for me?”



“Well, no, not exactly” she said with not even a hint of trying to hide her amusement. “I was told your wardrobe was handpicked by Luciano.”



Why the hell would Luciano do this for me? How would he even know my sizes? I haven’t even met the man. I’m just some pity case his sister asked him to take on and he’s spent all this money and bought all these things with me in mind? That doesn’t make any sense...



As if she couldn’t tell or didn’t care for my internal brain battle, Candy grabbed my hand and squealed. Causing me to shift back into focus and squint my eyes at the blonde bubble of energy who was now pulling things out left right and center and pushing them up to my body. No doubt trying to picture what I’d look like in each piece.



“Okay yesssss! This is it, put this one on” she said holding up a black leather corset and underwear.



After id slipped into the outfit, I matched it with a pair of sturdy black heels that laced up around my calves and a black leather chocker that looked slightly more like a collar but fit the look I was going with. Candy helped do my long black hair into a slicked back, high ponytail and finished off with a smokey eye and a bit of blush and mascara. She said I didn’t need much makeup because my skin was flawless as it was, and she only wanted to enhance a few of my features like my electric blue eyes and soft pink lips.



“Oh dang girl, you really did a number on her Candy. The men will eat her up. You’re going to have some competition now.” One of the other girls, Ruby, had said as she stood behind us in the floor to ceiling mirror. Looking back at myself I was shocked. I mean I had outfits from Stacy and dressed up every night I worked at Thrive, but they were all her style. This, what I was seeing, this was me, pure, dark, violence.



# Don't Be Nervous



The club was starting to liven up now, the music blasting, the lights flashing and people started flowing in through the doors. A strong smell of cigarettes and alcohol wafting through the air and a hum went through me from the bass of the music. Kevin told all of the girls where their stages were, and they all politely waved as they made their way out.



“Where do you want me?” I asked as I wasn’t yet given a stage to go to.



“You, my dear Violence have been requested to the VIP area by Luciano.”



“The VIP? Isn’t that usually reserved for the most experienced girls? I’ve only worked with Stacy for a couple of months, and I mean, I know what I’m doing but I’m sure of one the other girls here would be much better suited to your VIP customers.”



“Woah, slow down there, I can practically see your head spinning. Stacy already told us your experience, but she also told us you’re an absolute wonder on stage like you were born to be there. I’m sure Luciano just wants to get to know his newest girl. Come on, I’m sure you’ll do great. Plus, the customers up there give the best tips”. He said with a wink while holding out his arm to escort me to the top floor. I could use the tips, the two sugar packets id had in the last 24 hours weren’t doing me much good and I would eventually need to use some money for food and a backup plan. If there's anything I've learned over these last five years, its to always have a backup plan. In the beginning it was things like another park or bench to sleep on, scraps of food saved or a plan of the bus routes and towns. Since Stacy gave me the job in the last city though and I've had the taste of having a nice-ish place to sleep, I'm thinking a little bigger and I'd like to have enough money sitting aside for when I move again to get another apartment, clothes, toiletries, food, you know, the basics.



The stairs leading to the VIP section has a security guard at the bottom, he unclipped the rope and nodded to us to proceed up. I noticed the change in scenes almost immediately from the rest of the club. The main floor was packed with people now, it was brightly colored and energetic. I’m sure the flashing lights and rowdy customers would have quickly given me a headache. The top floor though, it was closed off from the rest of the club. Kevin showed me the pin to the door at the top of the staircase and when he opened it for me it was like stepping onto a completely different place. The music wasn’t as loud, still prominent but you wouldn’t have to yell over it. The lighting was dim but steady and the features of the room were mostly dark wood and black with a hint of gold and red. I stood next to Kevin, scanning the room, focusing on the stage at the back, it was large enough that I wouldn’t have to rely on the pole the whole time like at Thrive. This one had enough space that if I chose to, I could dance around it comfortably. True to the theme it had a golden pole, red lighting and dark wood making up the stage. I took a step towards its direction, ready to shut out the world and lose myself in the music with the promise of some easy cash, but Kevin placed his hand atop of mine on his arm before I could remove it. Giving him what I could only hope was a polite, questioning gaze he leaned closer to whisper in my ear. “The boss wanted to meet you before you get started. Don’t be nervous.”



Yes, because that’s what I needed not to be nervous I thought as my eyes snapped to the table to the right of the stage where Kevin was leading us now. Six large, well dressed, dangerous looking males were sat, all their eyes focused on me as we walked over. I was thankful now for the grip I had on Kevin’s arm as I’m pretty sure my stomach was ready to fall out of my ass at the sight of the largest man sat on end of the booth. He had jet black hair that was shorter on the sides and slightly longer on the top. Tattoos covered his hands and neck, I’m sure they led underneath his expensive looking suit too. I’m not even sure how his suit wasn’t tearing with how large his arms and thighs looked caressed in the material. Gold rings on his fingers were tapping mindlessly on his glass that I’m sure was filled with whisky. He looked like he’d drink whisky. He gave off a vibe that screamed Alpha male. He was dangerous and my stupid vagina couldn’t possibly understand that as it instantly heated when I finished scanning his Greek God gifted body and met his obsidian eyes. Nope, don't do that. I quickly avert my eyes and I'm met with piercing blues like mine. The man sitting next to him looks just as tall, maybe a bit leaner, blonde tussled hair and a boyish smile that makes me feel a lot more at ease. I scan the rest of the group and I swear there must be something in the dam water. Why are they all so massive? How the hell did Stacy grow up around these guys and not get pregnant? My ovaries are currently screaming at me to reproduce right now.



“Kevin” he said as his eyes flicked from mine to the male, I had forgotten I was holding on to.



“Mr Donatello, let me introduce you to your newest girl. This beauty here is Violence.""



He looks me up and down and smiles wickedly. His obsidian eyes stare straight into my soul.



# Did My Heart Just Stutter?



\*\*Luciano\*\*



“Violence…” I said with a smirk as I held my hand out to the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I didn’t bother to stand, no, that would give her an option to hesitate, and I needed her to know right from this moment that she was mine. I’ve never had my heart stutter before, being raised all my life to become what I am today never allowed for me to have such feelings. I am Don of the largest Mafia family in this country, my heart should not stutter, but this dark angel places her tiny soft hand in mine, that’s exactly what it did. I didn’t hesitate once I had her hand in mine. A slight tug and she was falling right into my arms. The hand I didn’t have a hold of came out to land softly on my shoulder and I placed the one I had on my other shoulder as I slipped my hand to the small of her back to bring her to sit on my lap in a perfect fluid motion. She's tiny against my body. Delicate, breakable but her eyes are fierce and hold a fire in them.



My sister, Stacy had told me about this girl working at one of my other clubs. She hadn’t said much, just that she appeared to be running from something or better yet, someone and needed my help to get her out of there. I initially agreed because I needed more dancers, but when I had my PI look into this girl, Lilly Ontario, he couldn’t find anything. Not a single trace of her ever existing anywhere and that intrigued me. Usually, even people under a false identity were an easy enough case for my guy but this girl has stumped him. I had called my sister back this morning after Lilly arrived to talk to Kevin. I needed to know more about her as I watched her from the security cameras in Kevin’s office. She was simply too breathtaking to just ignore. Stacy had told me about how she met her with nothing but the clothes on her back needing a job. She went on to tell me how after her first shift she had offered her a ride home as it was too late in the night to let the girl walk anywhere and when Lilly had pointed her in the direction of a park she quickly figured out where this girl has planned on sleeping and couldn’t allow it, so she took her home and let her stay on her couch for a couple of weeks until Lilly had enough cash to get a room at some shitty motel on the wrong side of town. There wasn’t much more of importance Stacy could tell me other than her clothes and shoe size and as my mind had tried to work out this pretty little anomaly I found myself at the mall picking out everything my brain could imagine her milky skin slipping in and out of. It’s usually a job I handed over to Kevin, but this girl did something to me, and I felt inclined to be the one to pick everything she would wear on that milky soft skin.



“oh... um, Mr Donatello…”



She was clearly thrown off by the sudden movements and didn't know what was happening. Good I thought, she will need to learn to trust me.



She was blushing a nice pink in her cheeks and oh man it looked so good on her. I wonder what things I could do to her to keep her blushing.



“Violence. I’m hoping you found everything you needed in the dressing room.”



“Uh yeah Sir, thank you, it was all more than enough and thank you for the club transfer.”



She was wiggling that tight little ass in my lap, no doubt nervous by my men and I, and I needed to remove her quickly before she felt how incredibly hard I was getting. That probably wouldn’t be the best first impression. Luca, my best friend and right hand was smiling at her like the bloody golden retriever he is, and she was shifting her eyes around on all of us unsure of where to look. It seems she settled on the floor. I made a note of teaching her out of that habit. This girl would learn to hold her head high in any room with me.



“Hmmm” I hummed. “Let’s get you situated on the stage then. My sister has asked that I take good care of you, so whenever you work here your only stage will be here in the VIP. I won’t have you downstairs with the rowdy crowd, okay?”



“Yes Sir, I understand, thank you.”



""I'm Luca by the way!"" he says as he holds out his hand.



""Are you going to swing me around and pull me onto your lap too?"" She says back with a little bite.



Luca looks at me with those stupid pleading puppy dog eyes like I might actually let him and I narrow my eyes to tell him to back off.



""Of course not, now that would be a rude way to introduce myself, wouldn't it?"" He winks and nudges me.



I roll my eyes and let the girl stand. I watch as she adjusts her outfit and steps back to Kevin.



""Ready to dance, Violence?"" Kevin says as she takes his arm again. The arm that I wish was mine. Fuck, really? Thats possessive of me...



She nods at him and they turn around towards the stage. I just sit and watch as that cute little ass struts away. Such perfect curves. I look at Luca who's doing to same thing and slap him up the back of the head.



""Hey!""



""Keep your eyes to yourself!""



""It's literally a strip club, Don and she, well she's something special to look at."" He wiggles his eyebrows and then rests his chin on his hands and continues watching her. I can't say I blame him. She really is something special.



# A Lady Doesn't Tell.



\*\*Violence.\*\*



To say that man is intimidating is a definite understatement. Stacy had asked him to take care of me though and I guess having a man like that in my corner would be a real asset. Kevin helped me onto the stage, and I was more than ready to dance. Something I figured out quickly at Thrive was that I was somewhat of a natural on stage. I was able to shut off the world, turn on my blinders and feel the music as if I was the only person in the room. I transported from this world where I was a pathetic run away with nothing to my name, to another where I was a powerful force of seductive and sexual energy, a goddess of the night where men would bow before me to witness my enchantments. I took a deep breath as the song finished and I run one hand up the cold metal of the pole. Closing my eyes I hear the beat of the music begin and I imagine that I transform myself into a flame dancing around with the fire that burns within my soul.



After about three hours Kevin comes back to let me know it’s time for break. He lets me know I can head down to the dressing room to eat if I wish, but obviously I didn’t bring anything and I think he already knew that.



“Well, there’s a two-drink limit when you’re working, but they’re on the house. You’re more than welcome to stay up here at the bar and you’ll find some fruit we usually use for the drinks in the mini fridge. We rarely ever use them so you’re welcome to those too.”



“Thanks” I mumble, half embarrassed and swallowing my pride as I tell him I’ll take him up on the offer.



I pour myself a rum and coke and slice an orange that literally has my mouth watering at this point. The rum is refreshing and cool as it trickles down my throat. I settled in on one of the stools as I tried to zone out the room.



“Hey, Violence, right?”



I hear a gentleman to my right say as he walks closer and gestures to the seat beside me. He was probably in his late fifty’s, well built like the rest of the men up here. There must be steroids in the water or something. If you saw him from a far, you’d probably think he had a full head of hair but as he got closer I noticed he was completely bald but instead it was tattoos that lined his head and bits of his face. His neck and hands were also inked, and he gave me the impression he could probably snap my neck in a heartbeat of he wanted to. His smile was warm though, something I wasn’t as accustomed to. Just like every other male up here his suit said, ‘I have money, a lot of fucking money’.



“Do you mind?” He gestures to the stool next to mine.



“Yes, of course, please” I say as I show that it’s fine he wishes to accompany me in my break. Which it most definitely is not. I hate small talk or talk in general. Why do you need to be here in my space? But I’m not going to say that, no, I need this job, and apparently this orange too as I can’t stop myself from devouring it. I had grown too comfortable with somewhat healthy eating habits and now I was suffering for it on the stupid two sugar packets.



“You’re an absolute dream up there darling, and your demeanor off stage too. Most girls can’t help but hang off the guys up here. Nagging in our ears and trying to get into our beds. It’s a welcome change. Something akin to how a woman should behave.”



“No offence Sir, but I couldn’t care less for your bed or the money dripping from you. I’m just here to earn my money and eat my free orange, but I will say you’re wrong if you think I behave anything like a fucking lady should”.



I couldn’t help myself. It just came out like word vomit when I should have shoved it into a mental vault and smiled ‘like a lady should’.



“Haha! He bellowed. “And a sharp tongue too. I guess that’s why they call you violence right?”



“Hmm something like that.”



“Would there possibly be another reason for the name?”



I raised my eyebrow in interest as I let the last orange skin drop down onto the plate in front of me.



“Maybe there is, maybe there isn’t. A lady doesn’t tell her secrets.”



“Well, that may be exactly what my club is looking for.”



He slides a white business card over to me discreetly and I look down to see it has nothing but an address on it. I’ve seen cards like these before, given it’s been a long time, but I would know the signs of an underground fight club anywhere. After all, my father owned one and trained me to fight before I could even walk.



“When?” that’s all I needed to know, because there was good, fast money in them and that is exactly what I needed.



“Ha, I knew I was right. I could see the fire in those eyes. Mondays and Fridays, 2am to 5am”



“And the password?”



A smirk formed across his stubble ridden face. He knew I wouldn’t be able to get in without that, but also didn’t tell me to see if I knew the way a fight club worked. Of course I knew, but I wasn’t about to divulge information I didn’t need to about how or why I knew how these things operated.



“Firefly.”



“Admission cost?”



“For you, Violence, I’ll cover your first round. You win that and you’ll have enough for a second round and some to pocket. Just tell Benji as the desk that Ronaldo has you covered.”



He finished his drink and went to leave before turning around.



“Oh, and this” he said as he pulled a stack of notes from his wallet and putting them on the bar in front of me. “This is a tip being such a lovely ‘lady’ to watch tonight.”



I nodded my head and smiled like I should have done to begin with before taking the money. I went to fold it and put it straight into the cup of my corset along with the business card, but my eyes snagged on the amount. Holy shit, there must be at least $500 here. I’m definitely eating all those biscuits tonight. If this man’s fight club was anything like my dad’s, then maybe I could get on my feet faster than I thought.



# Don First.



The rest of my shift went by really quick, and I managed to get a butt ton of tips although I hadn’t had a chance to count how much yet but by the feeling of how full my cups were, it’s more than enough to call this a running start. Id noticed Luciano’s eyes on me most of the night, which kept pulling my attention to him, but I guess every man up here was obviously going to stare at the seductively dressed female dancing on a stripper pole. I also kept getting overly excited looks from his friend Luca. That almost threw me off from the mask I was wearing a few times. He's got that contagious sort of smile that makes you want to smile back. I headed to the dressing room and told the girls about my night. Candy asked if I needed a lift home, but I politely denied, lying through my teeth that I had a lift. I do not need people getting close. I take what I need and nothing more, that's the safest option for everyone. When all the girls left, I made my way into my wardrobe to find my discarded outfit from earlier today but I promptly noted that there seemed to be a section of clothes that looked like everyday wear. Although it was odd that the owner of a club would provide normal clothes for the girls, I was extremely thankful and snagged a fresh pair of jeans, a white shirt and a black hoodie. Slipping out into the fresh early morning air I took out my phone to map the safest way back to the hotel. Most women would think it would be safer to take main roads with streetlights, but I knew better. Back roads, alley ways and the dark of night were my friend. I would regularly slink around in the dead of night unseen. My way of thinking was if no one knew you were there, how could they grab you?



It took half an hour on my detour route back and I immediately devoured the biscuits and started counting the tips from my night. Almost $2000, holy hell, I never made that much at Thrive. I decided that tomorrow I would try to look for a shitty apartment, hopefully one where I could pay with cash, and I’d need to find a gym to work out how rusty I had gotten fighting. Id kept up my stamina over the years, I usually liked to work out once a day to stay in shape. Usually at parks because it is free, but I would need a bag to gain back some muscle memory before Monday. Two days’ prep would have to be enough.



Having sorted out my plan for tomorrow I decided to pull the comforter off the bed to the floor where I know I would feel safer. I always felt safer there.

I sat with my men in the VIP section of the club most of the night. We had plenty to discuss with upcoming shipments and deals and when we were through with that I asked about my men’s families. Family was very important to us. I was raised alongside these guys. Our parents treated us all like siblings and would always remain close. I watched over Violence all night while talking with my guys. I was trying to be discreet about it, Luca was not, and I wanted to stay until her shift ended so I could ask to drive her back to wherever she was staying. Kevin hadn’t been able to get much personal information from her this morning when going through the paperwork with her and when he’d asked for a home address, she’s merely told him she didn’t have one yet. When he asked then for the address of where she would be staying, she told him that she had not yet checked into a hotel but would happily update him with that information when she had. By now she should have checked in somewhere so I wanted to drive her after her shift so I knew exactly where I could find my little angel.



My friend Matteo had gotten a phone call an hour before the club would close for the night. He excused himself to take it in my office off the side of the VIP section and when he came back, the look on his face told me it was going to be an even longer night.



“Boss, we just got word there’s been a sighting of Angelo near your sister’s club.”



“Well I guess we had better head there and check it out then.”



Angelo Salvatore was number one on our hit list and had been ever since he put my father six feet under 5 years ago. They had a meeting to discuss a possible alliance with gun trades but instead that idiot put a bullet in the back of his head before he even knew it was coming. He’s somehow been evading my men and I ever since. As much as I wanted to stay and make sure Violence got home safe, I needed to be Don first. Downing the last of our drinks, my men and I headed out for the night to travel the 8 hours to my sister's club. Maybe I could even get some more information of my little angel while I'm there. We took a few cars, leaving some men behind with Tony to look after things here while we were gone. If we could get a lead on Angelo I'd follow it like a hound. I've dedicated my life to killing him, my men have too. You don't just kill a Don and get away with it. I will follow him to the pits of hell if I have to just to get revenge for what he's done. He's like a bloody cockroach though and every time we get even the slightest tip of where he is, he's gone.",1,1750727709.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False
