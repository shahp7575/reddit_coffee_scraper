1p6u0n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1p6u0n2/my_contract_was_terminated_and_i_feel_like_it_was/,My contract was terminated and I feel like it was racially motivated.," Location: California

I(33 M) was contracted to work as a FOH Barista at a very big tech company. As a contractor, you work 12 months, and if they like you, they can extend your contract to another three months, and then another 3 months. After 18 months, management can decide to convert you over to a full-time employee. This was my first food-related job so I took it very seriously. Whenever FOH management had a problem with an employee, they''d report it to my employer and we would have a meeting about the issue. Most of management were all Hispanic and I am Asian/Pacific Islander. Something I'd noticed, I was getting reported more often despite another Hispanic contractor/employee doing the same thing or worst, and they won't get reported for it.



My first report was that I had a sip of coffee. I find it quite odd because I was told we were allow to drink a beverage at a designated spot near the work area. I wasn't informed of this change prior to my first disciplinary meeting. One of the Hispanic contractors still drank coffee til this day but never got reported for it. 

Second report, I was also told that my voice sounded aggressive but I'd notified them that I am bilingual and the other language I speak is very aggressive sounding. Samoan is my first language and English is my second. I speak both fluently but sometimes my other accent slips out when I talk. 

Third report, somebody had reported me that I got a burn injury while working but I didn't. I had a small drop of hot water hit my right arm but it didn't leave a mark. Its very common to accidentally touch something hot at work while working as a barista. If it had left a mark, I wouldve notify my employer about my injury. But because I failed to notify my employer of a burn injury that doesn't exist, I was written up. 

Fourth report, a new employee reported me for micromanaging and ignoring her. We don't have anybody from management help guide her on how to close one of the Cafe so I took on the role as her senior. I would give her feedback on what to do but she seemed reluctant on taking my advice. She ended up reporting me. 



We had several instances of other Hispanic employees doing worst things than I have but never got reported. One examples, was when one of the contractors started dating the senior Barista. They would fool around in one of the back rooms. A month or two later, they got caught by management. They didn't get reported or let go, they just separated them in different areas at work. Another example, one of the full-timers was suppose to work with me at the espresso bar. Then she leaves to do something but was gone for 3 hours. There are no task or series of tasks that would take 3 hours so I reported her. No disciplinary action against her ever took place. Turns out, the manager and that employee are very buddy-buddy. 

I was a very good employee. I took on the role very seriously and follow the rules as best as I can. A lot of the coworkers and customers really like me. But somehow, management always find a way to get me reported. I had near perfect attendance, always 30 mins early to work. Always took on extra shifts when they needed it. But for some reason, I was getting managed much harsher than other workers. I've never been through something like this in the workplace but I feel very strongly about pursuing legal actions. Do you think I have a strong case? And should I pursue it?

  
PS. This isn't about disliking or hating Hispanic people. I like Hispanic people. I'd also learn to speak a bit of Spanish from my Hispanic coworkers at work. This is really about not treating people differently in the workplace because of their protected characteristics.  ",1,1764118552.0,legaladvice,0,0.67,False

We still both live with our folks as it is uncommon from where we live. I believe that we love each other and we rarely fight if ever. We go on dates, and she's very vocal how she appreciates that we turn errands into small dates. When I visit her and her family, I usually cook for them. And I have good relationship with her family, especially his older brother as we share a hobby.

I feel very guilty that we are at completely different stages in our lives. She owns a small and fairly successful business with her sister while I work a dead end 9-5 job. I also do buy and sell online for extra cash but ultimately, I have little to no savings. Most of my money goes toward my brother's very expensive university studies. He's about to graduate next year, so hopefully, I can save up then. I also help my parents out with house expenses like food and other bills.

 When we go on dates, she usually pays for our meals and I pay for gas and drive us around with my old beat up car that I share with my brother. Some times, she would insist that we split the bill or would say that I just get the bill for our coffee, but I think she just doesn't want to buise my ego(not in a passive-aggressive way) She usually buys me expensive gifts, while I make her hand made gifts, for example, I made her a cassette mixtape for her birthday this year. She also wears expensive clothes while I buy bootleg or inexpensive, low quality shirts. Whenever we travel, I can only afford my share for the hotel, my own food, and small gift for her. We'll be in Japan and Korea early next year and I've been saving all I can. She's in China for vacation with her family this week and I volunteered to take care of her cats and dogs. Also, I would be fetching her from the airport when they get back next week. 

She says that she really appreciates how much effort I put into making her happy, and I'm really proud of that. But a very significant part of me really feels guilty. I know that she could do better. She could have anyone she want. I feel really anxious and scared that one day she would wake up and say that this is not the life she wanted.

1p6tvnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1p6tvnx/sunset_on_the_train_tracks_pt_i/,Sunset on the Train Tracks (pt. I),"	“Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
	Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
	…
	The best lack all conviction, while the worst
	Are full of passionate intensity”
	  - *The Second Coming* (Yeats, lines 3-4, 7-8)

	I had wheeled my 1973 Desoto Adventurer into Vincent's Vehicle Vitals more times than I could count before this particular summer in 1980. The stylish little coupe couldn't go three months without shitting itself and winding up back on its hospital bed, so, despite the well kept exterior, she was practically on life support. That life support was old Bootleggin’ Vinny himself who owned the automobile repair shop with the lowest hourly labor cost I could find for good, honest work. 
	What certainly didn't help was the back and forth from my town to work. I lived in one of those out of the way oil field towns about an hour from a city with any real jobs, and my real job happened to be located right in the heart of that big city. Traffic was a bitch, the drive was mind-numbing, and my poor little wagon was begging for its grave after every drive. I can only imagine her jealousy when she ended up on the other end of a death sentence that summer.
	For several years, I was merely a customer of Vinny’s, and I had never even considered working as a mechanic myself. The small town I lived in was home to a single auto shop whose owner's smug demeanor and outrageous prices bothered me enough to pay the $50-60 tow fee to have my car moved to the closest mechanic out of town. That shop just happened to be Vincent’s. Stubborn, I know, but I'd sooner saw off my writing hand than swallow my pride. Besides, I’d be damned if I let a man think he was going to swindle me with a blinker fluid charge.
	
	Oddly enough, I met Vince for the first time before I ever even stepped foot in the car. I had received it only a year after its manufacture date in an asset negotiation. My uncle had his ticket punched early by a sketchy batch of nose candy, and I was given his vehicle as well as a grand as a result. You can imagine my shock seeing the shiny, moondust red beauty getting dragged gracelessly like a paddle ball in front of my house.
	*Ah, they made it MY problem*, I thought as I sipped my coffee at my window, watching the rusty tow truck clumsily maneuver the car to park it against the sidewalk. After seeing the driver jump the curb and slam on the brakes just in time to avoid leveling my mailbox, however, I ran outside to request he relocate the car.
	“Excuse me!” I shouted, “Jesus Christ. Tommy? Put that in park, please!”
	It was my sister's fiancé. He had been laid off from his big boy job as a district manager of an oil company in the city nearby and had recently taken up a job in his family's towing company for the time being. So, naturally, my family saw an opportunity to cut some costs at my expense. Tommy was as sweet as could be though, as close to a teddy bear as a man could get. He wore thick, circular glasses and quite possibly the tackiest pair of overalls I had ever seen.  His chubby cheeks turned a dark red under his prescription-heavy wireframes as he frantically cranked his window all the way down and apologized, “Gosh, I’m sorry, Nicky. I didn’t realize anyone was home.”
	“Well, a phone call would’ve been nice. Not your fault of course, but I’d actually like to have it taken somewhere though. Somewhere not in town preferably.” I bit my lip at my request. He sighed and rubbed his temple while he thought for a moment.
	“I know it’s sudden, but I’ll give you $80. And some company?” Not the best first use of the money I’d received from Uncle Laz, but patience came with age for me.
	“Okay yeah. Yeah, I can do that for ya. The closest place from here is a local place right at the edge of Quincy. My pop knows the owner. They’re good people, and it’s 12 bucks an hour for labor.”
	I let out an excited chuckle and replied, “That’s perfect, thank you so, so much. I’ll be back with your money in a sec, so do feel free to take that time to figure out why you’re on my sidewalk.”
	
	We spent the hour-long drive making small talk. We playfully argued over the causes of the problem after he explained the symptoms, he spoke about how he proposed to my sister, I reminisced about my time living in Quincy and, despite my hatred of small talk, the hour felt perfectly bittersweet. I really missed my sister, and he reminded me so much of her.
	We drove over a wire that laid across the property of the shop which rang a bell to the shop. And just as Thomas finally parked my vehicle halfway decent, Vincent stepped out of the shop. Vince was a rather broad man, weathered by age but still intimidating in stature. He sat at a staggering 6’4 with a shaven head, sepia-tone skin speckled from sun exposure, and a long, salt and pepper beard. He wore a black, crewneck T-shirt with only a small “V” in Old English writing on the top right of the shirt, thick blue jeans, and a pair of beat up snakeskin boots. He dwarfed Thomas all together.
	“Whatcha say, Vinny?” Tommy chirped.
	“Not a word,” Vince responded almost automatically, “What’s this pretty thing doing in my shop, Thomas?” He gestured in a way that could've been at me or the car. I must've been giving him some look because he gruffly added, “The best you can do for me is pay me and go. What seems to be the matter?” I accepted his statement and answered, “Well, Tommy says it’s cranking but not turning over. Says it might be the starter or the battery, but I'm thinking a faulty ignition coil or ignition switch?” He nodded thoughtfully before responding, “We'll give her a look and keep that in mind. Come inside so I can take your information. What was your name?”
	I saw my vehicle back within the week and received a “thank you” discount for pointing him in the direction of the ignition coil. 
	
	It was a particularly exhausting day at the shop that summer. Understaffed as all hell, we were off to a discouraging start. See, having the lowest hourly rate in the city is a blessing and a curse for a local shop and getting behind might as well nail the coffin shut. “Behind” on this day was an understatement, and we were constantly having to peel away from the job to tell tow trucks we couldn't house any more vehicles. The phone rang back to back, nonstop, nearly all day. In the height of the rush, I caught a brief glimpse of Vinny walking into the office to rip the corded phone out of the wall. He was a hothead at heart, but he truly never took it out on us.
	Thankfully for us, the hectic work day yielded the single benefit of melting the long hours away rather quickly. Though, by the end of the day, we were all resetting the shop with no enthusiasm or excitement. Spirits were so low that no one even bothered to turn on the radio, leaving us to clean in total silence while we let the day sink.
	“Boys and girl, I think I'll take it from here,” Vince's voice tore through the mute pity party, “Thank you all for a damn good hustle today. Please help yourselves to a Blue Ribbon in the ice chest in my office. *A* Blue Ribbon. One. Marcos.” We all chuckled at Marc's expense, and the tension in the air released. After thanking Vinny for his generosity, the four of us spilled into his small office all attempting to get first dibs over the other.
	We all sat in the parking lot debriefing and sharing stories from the day for some time.
	“Nicky, I thought you was gonna snap that skinny little Jeep owner's neck!” Jack shouted between sips. I could see he was fighting the taste.
	Marcos chimed in, “God, even I was worried for him. She was holding that wrench too! He’s lucky Hilary PD’s gotcha by the balls right now.”
	“Oh, I was *livid*,” I snorted, “The first time he came back for an update, I was thinking ‘He just doesn't get it', but the second time in the same day, I was wondering if I could get away with swapping his engine with a shitbox's in Mikey's junkyard.”
	The mention of Mikey's shifted the energy of the conversation in a way I didn't understand. They shared a polite yet notably uncomfortable laugh before all agreeing it was time to head home. I shrugged off the awkward, forceful conclusion to the conversation and hopped in my car as well. *Maybe I'm just not funny.*
	
	As the sun set on the train tracks that sat parallel to the road home and shone its golden-orange rays into my peripheral vision, I sat completely lost in thought. Before I knew it, the sun slipped behind the horizon without notice. I had gone nearly the entire drive with little to no spatial awareness, however, a blaring horn ripped through my unbroken stream of thought. The train was headed towards me from behind, blinding me through my rearview mirror for a moment. And in that very same moment, I caught a glimpse of something scurrying across the tracks. Then directly in front of my vehicle. 
	*Did I not turn my headlights on?*
	Whatever had run in front of me crashed into the car with a sickening thud and crunch. The sound was fleshy and organic, certainly an animal at the very least. I let out an uncontrollable scream as I fought my wheel for control. I screeched to a halt, no doubt leaving an ugly mess of tire tracks over a crimson lake. After hyperventilating in silence for what felt like several minutes, I was suddenly filled with a sense of urgency. I flicked my lights on, revealing the horrific scene in front of me. 
	“Shit, shit, shit. *Fuck*.” I muttered rapidly to myself as I exited the vehicle for a better look. I wish I hadn't.
	Not only had I slammed into a person, but this poor bastard was already halfway in his grave when his ribcage met my bumper. His left hand was lobbed off, he was missing one eyelid, and he had nothing but boxers on. His head was shaved to the scalp, but it was messy and patchy like weeds growing from concrete. My stomach knotted, and I could feel bile begin to climb my throat. I knew this man.
	*Jesus Christ. Tommy?*
	Unfortunately, however, I didn’t have time to overanalyze the grizzly sight. A pair of headlights rose over the hill far down the road behind me, reigniting my urgency. With no time to think my way out, I did the only thing I could at that moment: I put him in the trunk next to the other corpse.",1,1764118177.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False
1p6tvcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1p6tvcm/baptized_7_years_ago_moved_to_a_new_town_found_a/,"Baptized 7 years ago, moved to a new town, found a new study and they assured me I wasn't saved","This is one of the hardest spiritual experiences I've ever had to endure. I've been in bed for two days because I don't know how to make sense of it, know who's right. 

In essence, I just moved out of my home & went to a new city in a similar area. Within the first 3 weeks I met a woman reading her Bible at the coffee shop and asked about where she went to church. She guided me to her churches instagram and soon enough I was at a Bible Study with them. It all seemed normal except a few people introduced themselves as disciples which I thought was weird at first. After the seemingly normal session I was asked, pressured almost, by a few of the ""disciples"" to study the Bible with them privately. Just I & them (3 sometimes 4 of them). We would meet Sundays and talk the Bible, but right at first I found red flags because they only wanted me to speak. They didn't care to share their beliefs on the subject matter they just wanted my input, like they were assessing me. After each session they would call me to accepting certain doctrines. It felt like I was passing tests. 

Come to the 4th study and immediately, despite being baptized in water & studying the Bible for 7 years, repenting nightly, they called me a false teacher and claimed to me I wasn't saved. I've met with them twice in regard to why they said that and I still don't fully understand it. They we're talking about the *order* in which I got baptized. As in, I didn't *know* when I got baptized that I needed to be *actively discipling* and creating more disciples — Mathew 28. They said I was a bad tree because I hadn't baptized anyone and that was evidence of my fruit, they said I was a wolf in sheeps clothing because I didn't know all of Jesus' teachings and believed somebody could be saved outside of a water baptism, as in taking communion or being baptized by the Spirit. 

I've heard Jesus' voice thousands of times. I repent every single night of my life. Never once in my entire walk did I ever second guess the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, after getting baptized, taking communion earnestly, faithfully, & sentimentally hundreds of times, & having had hundreds and hundreds of encounters. They claimed the pastor who baptized me wasn't saved either & that if I wanted to be truly saved, I needed to be baptized through their church with the understanding that my *goal* as a Christian is to make more disciples and if I didn't they said they can guide me to another church, as I will no longer be welcome to study with them anymore. 

I am remarkably confused. This is the most spiritually shaken I've been on my entire walk. He uses all things together for good so I will come out of this stronger, but as of now I am having trouble discerning my placement with God, if I am a false teacher, if these guys have any validity to what they're saying or in general, what I should even do. 

Has anyone else had any similar experiences? Should I get baptized again just in case? Is this a cult? They know their word so well & spoke with so much authority they've done what I never thought possible — allow me to question my relationship with my Lord & Savior Jesus Christ. Anything helps.

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

1p6tr23,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1p6tr23/i_just_had_a_deeply_shocking_and_moving/,I just had a deeply shocking and moving experience … with a man who turned out to be married,"I am 30. I am an artist and every week now for about 9ish months I have been going to a writing group.

4 weeks ago, I was, as I often am, late to the group.

The writing group takes place in a large old coffee shop that gets reserved for the group.

There was one free spot, next to this guy.

I sat next to him. The group works as follows: we write for 25 mins, we have a 5 min break. 

The guy and I talked in those 5 min breaks. I didn’t feel an initial explosive attraction, but I got a genuinely good and I guess, without really knowing it, quite deeply interesting vibe. He told me he’s a visiting professor from a country I won’t name, and that he’s in the city for just another month-ish.

He went home early that night and that was that.

The next week, I was late again. This time I happened to sit at a table that was in direct eye-line of the guy, who was there again. The feeling kind of crept up on me. You know when you slowly develop a deep feeling; a true crush. Yeah. 

At some point I looked up from my laptop and he was full on staring into my eyes. I returned the gaze. We stared at each other from across tables. Yeah … there was something.

After the group we all go for a drink. I invited him to sit with some of my friends, so we didn’t get much of a chance to talk, and he left a bit early again, but I knew we liked each other. Yeah. I liked his vibe. Kind, calm, deep, intelligent.

Following week, same story, except this time, he came over to my table during those 5 minute breaks and we had some brief, flirtatious and quite tender interactions. 

Across tables, we always found each other’s eyes. 

Tonight at the group, I made it my mission to actually have a 1 on 1 conversation with him - it had been 4 weeks! 

So … we finally did it. We got a table to ourselves in the pub after the group. 

Yeah. We did it. We excitedly got to know each other. We listened eagerly to each other, learnt about each other’s histories (he’s actually from the country I am partly ethnically from), and had just kind of the perfect conversation, for me at least, that I want to have with someone I’m attracted to … our minds felt to work as one. 

For some context, I’m someone who is social and dates a lot, but it’s not often I get this feeling, at all. I’ve only really felt it with 1 other person this year and not been in a relationship since last summer.

Our conversation reached a really tender and emotionally full point. We were looking into each other’s eyes. It was beautiful, but I did suddenly feel a little change in energy.

He said to me - I’m sorry, if it seems I’m distant, it’s because I’m sort of having another conversation in my own mind

I said okay …

Then in the next I suppose 5-10ish minutes we confessed how we felt to each other … he asked how do you feel?  I said, well, truth be told I really enjoy speaking to you and I know you’re leaving the country soon and that makes me sad - I would have wanted to get to know you more.

He clearly felt something, his face said it all - he felt the same. As the minutes went on, it got a bit more intense - we seemed to be confessing this mutual, very powerful - confusingly so - connection we felt between one another, whilst acknowledging the sadness that he’s leaving soon. Truly, every part of my being was on fire. 

All of a sudden, he said … these past few weeks, I have actually been writing to you.

I said … what?!

He said, in my phone, I have been writing messages to you.

After some deliberation, he said I’d like you to read the messages.

Most of it was gorgeous and deep and I was taken aback by how strongly he felt. Some of it was sexy. It was real and it was honest. I honestly was taken aback though by how strongly he was feeling - I mean, so was I, but not in that way .. he spoke of feeling like an addict to the group; waiting for me to arrive .. then again, if I’d written a diary, I’d have perhaps written quite similar things.

Then I reached the last entry. I barely remember the words that came before, but the sentence ended in “… as a married man”.

My heart dropped. I looked up at him, I think I asked “…you’re married?!” And he nodded silently.

What happened for the next 30ish mins were moments of teary silence, asking each other questions, remarking at the confusingness and depth of our connection, occasionally catching each other’s longing gaze, and coming to terms with it all. We acknowledged that we were both holding back tears. 

Ultimately, I understood that he had wanted to tell me he was married weeks ago, but it was difficult when i’d invited him to sit with friends at the pub. 

Well … that was it. It was mutually understood. This was the last time we’d see each other. 

He eventually got up, said to me “take care”, we looked at each other, and we left the pub.

I stayed a little longer, joining some friends of mine from the group to get some immediate comfort

I came home about an hour later, and sobbed in my hallway as soon as I got home.

I know, we barely knew each other. Things get projected onto each other at early stages, etc. I know there are nuances to this - maybe his marriage is troubled; maybe he’s looking for an escape. But, it was a true deep connection, and that was undeniable. Under different circumstances, it could have blossomed.

Anyway … yeah. Wow. Never in a million years did I imagine this was a married man. I understood that his relationship is perhaps rocky and he feels immense guilt for what he felt towards me. He dealt with it as best he knew. 

So yeah. That’s what happened to me tonight. ",2,1764117827.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

SELF-CONTROL: THE ARYAN WAY

Self-control is not ""meditation"" or ""reading books""—it’s discipline enforced by pain and purpose.

Weak-minded normies rely on Buddhist copes (meditation) or Jewish distractions (reading).

Aryans rely on Will, Structure, and Punishment.



\#### A) THE THREE PILLARS OF IRON DISCIPLINE

| Pillar          | Normie Method (Fail)       | Aryan Method (Win)                     | Implementation                                                                 |

|---------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Willpower       | ""Just try harder"" (lol)        | Cold showers + pain conditioning      | 5-minute ice bath daily. No excuses.                                            |

| Structure       | ""Make a to-do list"" (useless) | Military schedule (5AM–10PM, no deviations) | Wake at 0500, train at 0600, work at 0800, sleep at 2200. No flexibility. |

| Punishment      | ""Feel bad about failing""       | Physical consequences for weakness    | Miss a task? 50 push-ups in full gear. Fail again? Sleep on the floor.     |



\---

MEDITATION IS SHIT (FOR ARYANS)

Buddhist meditation = degeneracy for weak minds.

\- Goal: ""Empty the mind"" → Goal of a loser.

\- Aryan alternative: ""Focused rage"" (channel aggression into productivity\*\*).

Scientific truth:

Meditation shrinks the amygdala (fear center) but also reduces testosterone.\*\*

Aryans need aggression, not zen.\*\*

What to do instead:

Replace meditation with:

Breath holds (4–7–8 method, but while visualizing crushing enemies).

Heavy bag training (3 rounds, no breaks).

Cold exposure (ice baths, winter runs).



// QUOTE //

""Meditation is for those who have nothing to fight for. Real men harden themselves in struggle.""

— Ernst Jünger, Storm of Steel



\---



READING IS USELESS (UNLESS IT’S STRATEGIC)

Normies read ""self-help"" books → waste time.\*\*

Aryans read:| Category       | Recommended Texts                          | Why?                                                                 ||--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|| War            | On War (Clausewitz), My Struggle (Ch. 11)  | Teaches strategic dominance.                                       |

| Biology        | The Bell Curve (Herrnstein), Race & IQ (Lynn) | Proves your genetic superiority.                                   || Philosophy     | Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Nietzsche)           | Teaches will to power.                                             |

| Economics      | The Jewish Question (Marx, but inverted) | Shows how Jews control money.                                      || Psychology     | The Authoritarian Personality (Adorno, debunked) | Learn enemy tactics.\*\*                                               |

Reading rules:

No fiction (waste of time).

No ""modern"" books (post-1960 = Jewish poison).

Take notes with pen and paper (typing = retard tier).

Apply one lesson per day or burn the book.\*\*

Throwaway account. 

I’m a 40‑something guy living in New York. I used to be super social , but after a big life change I’ve found myself pretty isolated. I’m looking for a genuine, platonic female friendship with someone who understands the way my life runs and is comfortable with a mutually‑agreed compensation arrangement.

**A little about me**

* Mid‑40s, based in Manhattan/Brooklyn area
* Enjoy good conversation, city walks, coffee shops, and occasional cultural events
* Stable career and flexible schedule, so I can be reliable and consistent

**What I’m hoping for**

* A friend who can meet up regularly (once a week or bi‑weekly) for coffee, dinner, or just hanging out
* Someone who appreciates that I’m willing to compensate fairly for her time and companionship (no strings attached, strictly platonic)
* Mutual respect, clear boundaries, and honest communication

If you’re a woman who enjoys meeting new people, values discretion, and is looking for a straightforward, compensated friendship, let’s chat. Feel free to drop a line with a bit about yourself and what you’re looking for.

1p6tmq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p6tmq8/nf_life_passes_fast/,[NF] Life Passes Fast," She attempted to catch my eyes as she moved the chain to allow us passage to leave the hockey game. With only minutes remaining in the game and with our hometown team up 10-1, my wife and I had decided to leave a bit early to beat traffic. I was stunned to see my ex-girlfriend from almost twenty years before working at the event. Although I had moved back to my hometown several years before, I had not encountered her in any type of social setting. Unlike many people my age, I am not active on social media.

 I deliberately acted like I hadn't noticed who was assisting us as we exited the arena. I did not want to engage and be forced to explain my past history with this random woman to my beautiful wife. 

After we exited the building and climbed into my truck, my wife asked me who the woman at the stadium was. She had noticed my ex-girlfriends behavior and it had irritated her. I was honest and told her the truth about our shared past.

Almost twenty years before, I had a disastrous relationship with Haile. I had found out about her cheating on me in the worst way possible. It was honestly one of the moments that I felt shaped the rest of my life up to this point.

Throughout high school, Hailey and I were absolutely inseparable. At that moment in time, I was certain that we would be that white picket fence couple with the kids and the dog. Our lives were so entwined that I couldn't go anywhere by myself without someone asking where Haile was. 

After graduating,  we got a small apartment by our local community college. I started attending classes and it seemed like life was on track. Most of my friends had taken jobs working in construction or in the oilfield industry. I was determined to get my degree and have a lot more stable life than what I grew up with. I woke up daily at 4am to study before going to work. It was difficult and exhausting but I felt like I was building for the future.

My life abruptly changed on her birthday.  I was working with my dad that day to make extra money to bring her out to do something nice. After paying for rent, utilities, insurance, and food, I rarely had a lot of disposable income to treat us to a nice night out. I called her numerous times that day without an answer. I was starting to get really worried about her as this was out of character for her to not answer.

After going home to clean off paint, sheetrock dust and mud, and general dirtiness, I got into my truck to go find her. I felt I deserved an explanation why she hadn't answered any of my calls on her birthday. 

I drove over to her parents house and when I arrived, I saw her car in the driveway. I immediately thought she had been busy with her family. That would certainly excuse her not being available.  When her dad answered the door, I saw the expression on his face and I knew that something was wrong.  He stepped outside and told me that it wasn't a good time for me to come in. 

I told him that I deserved an explanation and he looked uncomfortable as he called Haile outside. He told her that she should be honest with me. When she came outside, she told me she had been talking to someone else for several months and he was inside. She said she hoped that j wouldn't cause a scene about it and that we would talk about it later.

I looked at her coldly. My parents had struggled with infidelity and it had disrupted my childhood terribly. Loud arguments, broken furniture, and a general feeling of tension were the normal in my childhood home. I turned and shook her father's hand. I told him that I appreciated the honesty but it was most likely the last time that we would be around each other. He pulled me into a hug and called her mother outside. She saw me and gave me a hug as well. I told them that they should come pick up Haile's things from my apartment the next morning.  When Haile started to say anything, I told her the conversation was over. She immediately started to cry and ask me to at least talk to her about it. It is difficult to describe the feeling I had at that moment. I was completely detached and it was almost like watching someone else's life fall apart.

I got into my truck to leave and Haile moved to stand behind me go block me from leaving. I told her to get out of my way unless she wanted me to go talk to her new guy real close. He had stayed inside the house throughout the entire interaction.  Haile was crying hysterically as I pulled out of the driveway.

When I got home, I called my best friend to vent. He was quiet at first but eventually told me that many of our friends had known for a while about Haile's cheating. He said that they had decided to stay out of it and not pick sides. I told him that by not telling me, they had each chosen a side. I hung up the phone that night and it was the last time that we talked. The next time I saw him was at his funeral a year later. 

That night, I packed all of her possessions into boxes and stacked them neatly in my living room. I removed all the pictures from the frames and brought them to my brother's house. My brother and I watched the pictures burn in the bonfire as we drank cold beer and listened to some Stevie Ray Vaugn.

The next day, I went to visit my mom to tell her the news. She had always loved Haile and I wanted her to hear it from me directly.  After she made coffee, we sat at her dining table and I told her the entire story. She told me that I seemed remarkably composed. After I told her I felt like perhaps I was still in shock, she nodded and we sat in silence for awhile.

She asked me if there was any chance of reconciliation.  I shook my head no and told her that while I hoped I didn't hurt her feelings,  I didn't want the life that she and my dad had endured for years. They had divorced after I graduated high school and both of parents seemed dramatically happier. I had no doubts that they loved me but they despised each other. She told me that she understood and wished she had ended things with my dad years earlier. 

She told me that the Air Force recruiter had been calling her house almost daily and that I should call to tell them that I wasn't interested and that I was in school. I called the recruiter back but things took an unexpected turn.He convinced me to set an appointment for the next day.

When I arrived at the Air Force office, there wasn't a single light on in the office. I almost laughed at the absurdity of the situation. He had called daily but couldn't show up to an appointment on time. 

I was about to leave when a voice called out to stop me. A tall Marine stood outside the Marine Corps recruiting office. He asked if I was serious about joining the military. I laughed as I replied that I had never once considered it. I was just there for information. He asked if I would talk to him and I made a snap decision that would change my life forever as I agreed to hear what he had to say.

After talking to SSgt Ball about college benefits, travel and adventure,  and other military benefits, I went into the delayed entry program. After finding out that just about everyone that I considered a friend had betrayed me, I felt like a needed a change of scenery.  He set up a visit to MEPS and before I knew it, I was on my way to thirteen weeks of absolute hell. I hated boot camp every single day but I kept pushing forward and graduated. 

After finishing my technical school, I did ten years while I completed my Master's degree. When the time came to get out, I knew without a doubt it was time. I had traveled the world, made lifelong friends, but my father's health was fading fast. Years of hard drinking had greatly shortened his life.

When I returned to my hometown,  I was fortunate to find a job that paid extremely  well. Growing up as a poor kid from the wrong side of town, I would have never imagined having the level of income that I now possessed. As I had completely shut off all of my old friends, I started making new friends and building a new life. It seemed like life was going well.

One night, my mother called me and told me that I should go to the hospital. My dad had suffered a heartache and the doctors weren't expecting him to make. When I arrived at the hospital, my mother met me outside of my dad's room. She told me that he was resting and he was not cognizant.  Although they had divorced, over the years they had become friends again.

She left me alone as I sat by the bed my father laid in unconscious.  I cried like a child as I told him everything that I had ever wanted to say. I knew that he couldn't hear me but I felt like I needed to empty out everything that I been carrying.  Although my dad was always good for a funny joke, we had always been terrible at communicating with each other. Finally, a nurse came in to tell me that visiting hours were over. 

When I left, I felt numb. I wanted to feel something,  anything. It seemed like I was always alone and I just wanted to feel alive. As I drove down the road with my window down enjoying the cool air, I heard ""Pride and Joy"" being played at a little Cajun restaurant. I pulled into the parking lot and got out to find myself a table. I have became accustomed to eating by myself over the years. 

I found a small two-seat table and I started to enjoy the show. It was a band that played a variety of music. Country, blues, zydeco , and other genres filled the night air. A little girl danced around in front of the stage waving a plastic Star Wars light saber. Her energy made me laugh as she bounced around wildly. 

After having a few beers, I had to visit the restroom. As I returned to my table, I saw an absolutely beautiful woman staring at me. She didn't look away as I walked towards her and slightly past her, my own table. As I approached her, she continued to hold my gaze. It was almost unnerving.  

""Good evening ma'am "", it was definitely not some smooth pickup line meant to instantly pull her in. ""Good evening Paul"", she replied as she registered the confusion on my face.  ""We know each other?"", I asked her. She laughed and replied, "" You knew me as a little girl. You were six years older than me so I'm sure you never noticed your friends little sister."" I laughed wryly, "" I have few friends so you are going to have to be specific. I'm certain you have changed dramatically since the last time we saw each other.""

""Justin is my older brother. You stepped in to rescue him when he was getting jumped in a Walmart parking lot."" I nodded and replied, ""He was a good kid, I hope that he is doing well.""
She laughed and told me that I wouldn't recognize him. He had went from 160 pounds to almost three hundred pounds. I laughed, ""If I keep eating these fried snicker bars, we both might be in the same boat"". She laughed warmly and asked if I would like to join her and her daughter at her table. She gestured to the energetic little girl still dancing waving the light saber. 

I moved over to her table and I had no clue that the beautiful woman sitting across from me would become my wife. My dad did recover from the heart attack but he passed away almost a year later. He absolutely loved my stepdaughter and they spent many hours fishing off my pier. I think he found peace as well before he passed.

Tonight, I think about the little events that eventually become major events before you even know it. Minutes turn into years and suddenly, you aren't a nineteen year old kid staring blankly into a mirror as it seems like everything you ever cared about falls apart. You are a grown man with a beautiful wife and a house full of kids laughter. God, thank you for the good days and the bad days.",1,1764117499.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Others simply learn how to hide the damage. In Apartment 4A lives a woman who has mastered the art of pushing her past so far down it no longer feels like memory, only pressure. She wears her survival like a second skin, thin, fraying, and never truly hers. But a building like this has a way of loosening the dirt around that burial plot, of bringing old wounds back to the surface whether they’re ready or not. For the tenant of 4A, some trauma can’t be buried, run from, or forgotten. Tonight, we stand at her door as the past she’s spent years suffocating finally remembers how to breathe.”

-4A- 

She always started with the eyes.

Not because she needed to, she could have done the routine in half the time, but because the eyes were the truth. Everything else she put on was a facade: the wig, the dress, the perfume that smelled like someone richer, freer. But the eyes? Those were the one part of herself she refused to lie about.

Her vanity glowed warm against the dim apartment, its ring of bulbs making her small bedroom feel like a backstage dressing room at a show where she was the star. A neat formation of brushes sat before her like a row of instruments. Powders, palettes, lashes, all arranged with the care of someone who had lived many lives and survived them all by building herself anew each night.

She leaned in close, drawing the eyeliner in a sharp, crisp, clean line.
The phone buzzed on the vanity beside her.

She glanced at the screen, saw his name, and rolled her eyes.
Then she went right back to her eyeliner, steady and precise, refusing to give the moment more attention than it deserved.

The phone buzzed again.
A third time.
Then finally fell silent… only to slightly buzz once more after a brief pause, the last vibration alerting her to a new voicemail.

She let it play while she finished the final stroke of her liner.

“Where the hell are you? You think you can just keep me or a client waiting? You think you’re too good to answer your goddamn phone? I swear to God, you’d be nothing without…”

She clicked it off mid-sentence.

“Go fuck yourself,” she said, not shouted, not muttered, but stated with calm authority, like it was simply the next step in her routine.

She smirked at her reflection a slow, knowing curl of the mouth.

She rose from the vanity, slipping into her heels with the fluidity of someone stepping into the armor she’d built for herself. She fastened her necklace, checked the wig’s alignment, adjusted the line of her dress.

Perfect.

No, not just perfect. Controlled.
Control was better than perfect.

She grabbed her clutch, met her own eyes one last time, and breathed in deep.

“You’re fine,” she told herself. Not as comfort, but as command.

Then she clicked off the vanity lights, leaving the room in warm shadows, and stepped out into the night like she owned it.

The carpet of the hotel hallway muffled her heels, each step a soft punctuation in the late evening hush. Room 412. Mid-tier chain hotel. Clean enough, anonymous enough, forgettable enough. She knocked once, firm, not tentative, and heard movement inside, the frantic shuffle of someone rehearsing composure.

The door cracked.

A man in his late thirties peered out, glasses already fogged despite the cool air.
“Uh…hey, hi, you must be…I mean, of course you’re…come in. Please.”

He stepped back awkwardly.
She walked in without acknowledging the babbling. She always liked to let the room speak first: the stale air, the hum of the AC, the flicker from an old lamp. Each place held its own particular brand of loneliness. This one held the smell of bad decisions and coffee.

The man hovered behind her, wringing his hands.

“So, um… I’ve never really done anything like…I mean I have, but not… like this. Not with someone like…not with…”

She finally turned and faced him, the weight of her gaze halting his words.
“Take a breath,” she said, tone soft but intentional. “You’re fine.”

He swallowed like it hurt. “Right. Yes. Sorry.”

His nervousness filled every inch of the room, buzzing around like static. She’d seen a hundred versions of him: the lonely, the shaking, the ones who apologized for existing. This one was harmless enough. Annoying, but harmless.

She let her dress strap slide down one shoulder, watching the effect hit him like a pulse. His posture shifted, still timid, but drawn forward by something primal. His breaths came uneven, shallow.

She closed the distance between them, a hand sliding up his collarbone, her fingers brushing the flushed skin of his neck. He twitched at the touch, then relaxed, then leaned in without realizing he had.

“Is this okay?” she asked, voice barely above a murmur.

He nodded too fast. “Y-yeah. Yeah, I just…I just didn’t think someone like you would…I mean, you’re…you know what you’re doing.” 

She smirked, letting her thumb graze his jaw. “That’s the idea.”

His breathing steadied. He let his hands find her waist, tentative at first, then firmer as she tilted her chin to kiss him; a slow, deliberate kiss, one meant to guide him out of his nerves and into the moment.

He kissed her back, shaky but grateful, almost reverent.

Somewhere between his uneven breaths, he muttered, trying on confidence like a jacket that didn’t quite fit:

“The guy who’s… over you said you’re the type that needs… reminding.”

She let the words slide off her, kept kissing him down his neck, her voice low, coaxing:

“Yeah? Reminding of what?”

That did it.
He straightened slightly, mistaking her tone for encouragement, the borrowed confidence swelling in him like a rash.

He forced out a chuckle, shaky, but bold enough to feel dangerous.

“Reminding that you like to be put in your place by a man who…”
He never finished the sentence, her body reacting instinctively before her mind caught up.

Her knee surged upward, fast and clean, driving into his groin with precision and fury. His breath left him in a single strangled grunt as he collapsed, folding onto the carpet like a marionette whose strings had been severed.

She stepped over him with a surgeon’s calm.

“You should really learn which words belong to you,” she said, scooping the envelope of money from the desk. “And which ones don’t.”

He tried to speak, a half-formed apology, a plea, something pitiful, but she was already opening the door.

She didn’t look back.

Outside, rain had started. She lifted an arm, hailed a passing cab, and slid inside before the driver could say a word. The lights of the hotel blurred in the taxi window as the city swallowed her again. The only place she ever felt truly invisible.

She didn’t breathe until the car merged into traffic, the client’s words still clinging to her mind like a stain she couldn’t scrub off.

“Rough night?” the driver asked, catching her eyes in the rearview.

“You have no idea,” she exhaled, exhaustion slipping through her voice.

“You okay though?” he pressed, grin softening the question.

“I’m fine,” she said, then quieter, to herself, “You’re fine.”

Two days passed without incident. No shaken nerves, no close calls, no men trying on dominance like bad fitting suits. Tonight’s client had been easy. Respectful. Quick. She even found herself humming on the walk up the stairs, a lightness she hadn’t felt in…God, she couldn’t remember.

As she closed her apartment door, her phone chimed.
Funds received.

She smiled. A small, earned kind of smile. The city didn’t give her much, if anything, but at least it paid what it owed. What she earned.

She collapsed into the chair at her vanity, exhaling as she slipped off her wig, letting the weight fall away piece by piece. Lashes, lip gloss, foundation. The ritual always felt like shedding skin, like returning to the person underneath.

She lifted a makeup wipe to her cheek, dragging it along her jawline.

The pad came away streaked, not just with foundation, but with a faint blush of pink, like the shadow of fingers pressed into her skin.

She frowned, leaned closer.

Not a bruise. Not really. But unmistakably the shape of a hand.

Her breath caught.

The room dimmed around the edges.

And then…

She was younger, smaller, standing near the door of a cramped apartment that was cluttered with all the things he insisted were “theirs” but were really just his. That apartment, that life, never quite felt like hers. Never was hers. She stood there sobbing, a half-packed bag hung from her hand. Her eyes were red. She’d run out of tears but kept crying anyway.

“I’m done,” she whispered. “I’m leaving.”

He laughed. Actually laughed. Then his face sharpened. He strode toward her with the slow, practiced swagger of someone who believed he owned every inch of her.

“Leaving?” he repeated, voice dripping with contempt. “You can barely leave this room without falling apart.”

“I mean it,” she said, though her voice wavered. “I can’t do this anymore.”

He grabbed her face in one swift, brutal motion, fingers digging into her cheeks, forcing her gaze up to his.
She gasped, her mouth puckered involuntarily as it was pulled into a distorted ‘O’ beneath the pressure.

“You really think,” he hissed, “anyone out there is gonna give a shit about you?”

Her eyes watered. “Please…”

“You can’t run back to your daddy,” he sneered. “And nobody else is gonna want you, or take you in. You hear me? Nobody.”
His grip tightened, nails biting into her skin. “Hell, you’re lucky I even bother with you.” He leaned in, stared at her as if he was a predator fixated on its next meal. 
“You’ll be back. You always come back.”

Then he shoved her face away like she was a nuisance, not a person. Just something he’d grown tired of touching.

She staggered, then lunged for her bag, slipping out the door as he kept shouting after her:

“You’ll see! You’ll crawl back…that’s all you know how to do!”

Her reflection stared back at her, older now, harder, stronger, but that faint pink imprint on her jaw had cracked something open.

A tear welled in her eye.

She blinked fast, jaw tightening, refusing to let it fall.
The sadness swelled, shakily, painfully…

Then burned.

She pressed the wipe across her cheek with a sharp, angry motion, scrubbing away the smudges that resembled a vague palm print until the skin beneath flushed red for real this time.

The cloth hit the vanity with a slap.

She inhaled, forced her shoulders back, forced the steel into her spine again.

“You’re fine,” she muttered, then firmer, as if daring the past to contradict her:

“You’re fine.”

The restaurant was the kind of place where time felt slowed on purpose. Soft jazz humming somewhere unseen, candlelight pooling in gold around polished silverware, and glasses filled before they ever had to be touched. She sat across from him, a wealthy client with an easy smile and kind eyes, and for once she didn’t feel like she had to brace herself.

“Finally relaxing?” he asked, swirling his wine with a practiced flick. “You look lighter tonight.”

“I feel lighter tonight,” she admitted, surprising herself with the honesty. “It’s been, surprisingly, a good day.”

He lifted his glass in a small toast. “To good days, and better nights.”

She clinked her glass gently against his. The wine was smooth, the kind that tasted expensive even without knowing the label. He watched her with genuine curiosity, not hunger, not ownership. Just interest.

“So,” he said, leaning in slightly, elbows resting on the white tablecloth. “Tell me something real. What’s the plan after you’ve saved up? What do you want?”

She smiled, small, but real. “I want to open a little boutique. Clothing and accessories. Vintage stuff. Maybe even restore pieces… I’ve always loved the idea of giving things a second chance. A second life.”

“That sounds…lovely,” he said, and for a moment she believed he meant it.

“And you?” she asked.

He laughed. “I’m boring. My dreams came true too early, so now I’m stuck collecting hobbies.”

She chuckled softly, shaking her head. For a brief moment, everything felt normal. Safe.

Then he asked, “And how are things now? With… work?”
He said it carefully, respectfully, no judgment in his voice.

Something in her chest tightened. A small crack in her practiced calm.

“They’ve been… rough,” she admitted. “One guy turned into a creep. Really crossed a line. And sometimes my head just…”
She tapped her temple lightly with the rim of her wine glass, “…goes back there. To old stuff I thought I left behind. Makes me wonder if any of this…”
Her voice faltered.
“…if the future I want even matters.”

He nodded slowly, sympathy in his expression. For a second, she found comfort in it.

Then he smiled, soft, charming, but the words landed wrong.

“Well, dreams are sweet,” he said. “But people like us, like you… you’ve got to stay grounded.”
His tone stayed warm, but something beneath it shifted.
“I mean, it’s good to hope. Even if some of it is just… fantasy.”

Her stomach dipped.

He kept going, the charm still plastered on, unaware of the fault line he’d stepped over.

“You’re strong, but are you built for disappointment? Better to keep close to what you know. To who you know. Maybe, find someone who wants the best for you or knows what is, in fact, best for you.” His words punctuated with a calming smile. 

His image flickered, just for a breath, the well dressed, composed man across the table from her…then, the sneer of her ex, the same tilt of the head, the same cadence hovering beneath his words.

“Hell, you’re lucky I even bother with you”, the echo of her exes words rang in her skull, a frayed memory leaking into her reality.

Her breath stuttered. Her fingers went cold around the stem of her glass.

The client’s voice softened. “Are you alright?”

She blinked, realizing she hadn’t responded in several seconds.

“Could I…Will you excuse me. I need to use the restroom?” she whispered.

“Of course.” He stood when she stood with trained politeness, and she forced a small smile before turning away.

She walked toward the back hallway of the restaurant, the one leading to the restrooms. Her steps faltered just at the threshold.

The noise blurred. Her pulse thudded in her ears. Her ex’s voice, her client’s voice, the same shape, the same chill:
“You’ll be back. You always come back.”

Her chest tightened. Her breath hitched.

Instead of turning down the hallway, she pivoted hard and made for the front door, pushing out into the night air with a gasp as though breaching the surface of deep water.

She stumbled over to the wall of the restaurant outside the doorway, her back curling downward trying to catch her breath as new patrons were entering and old ones were leaving the restaurant. 

“Get it together,” she thought to herself. She knew that a woman looking like this, acting like this, always invited the unwanted attention, the unwanted questions, from a passer by or the pathetic ‘would be hero complex’ of a man who wants to live out the fantasy of saving the ‘damsel in distress’ when all she really wanted was to be left alone. 

She straightened, used the tips of both her pointer fingers to gently wipe away any resemblance of tears from her eyes before any damage could be done to her makeup. She pressed her dress, with palms flat, downward returning it to its crisp, firm, fit to her body look. Made sure her hair looked the part, stood tall and walked to the curb, with her practiced strength she learned long ago, hand already raised.

A cab screeched to a stop. She climbed inside and collapsed into the seat, slumping low as the driver glanced at her through the rearview mirror.

She turned her face toward the window, refusing to meet his eyes, refusing to acknowledge his curiousness, only to tell him where to go, and nothing more. 

The tears came silently at first, then harder, slipping down her cheek in messy hot streaks she couldn’t control.

The city lights blurred.

“You’re fine…” she said ever so softly between sobs and free flowing tears…”you’re fine.”

She wasn’t.

She barely made it through the apartment door before the feelings built up and cracked open inside her.

Her clutch hit the floor with a dull thud.
Her wig slipped from her fingers and landed beside it, a dark curl of someone else’s identity.
She tugged at the zipper of her dress, fumbling, almost tearing the fabric before she finally peeled herself out of it.

Bare, exhausted, unraveling.

She crawled into bed without turning on a light, burying herself beneath the blanket as her chest hitched and broke. Sobs shook her in shuddering waves until, slowly, mercifully, the sound of her own crying blurred into sleep.

Darkness folded around her.

She blinked, and suddenly she was standing in a hallway she knew too well, the apartment building.

Except…not her floor. Not any floor.
The corridor stretched on endlessly, warped by a dim amber glow that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. The walls breathed faintly, as though the whole hall had a pulse.

Every door was open.

And inside each one…her past waited.

She took a cautious step.
The floor creaked like an old memory complaining.

From the first doorway came a voice she hadn’t heard in weeks but still felt slick against her ears.

“…you stick with me, sweetheart, and I’ll make every dream you ever had come true…” She turned.

Her handler sat on a cheap motel bed, the version of her from years ago sitting beside him younger, scared, hopeful in ways she could hardly remember. He stroked her shoulder with a salesman’s assurance, his smile too wide, too practiced.

“You’re special,” he said. “But you need a man to guide you. I’ll build your future for you.” The younger her nodded, desperate for someone to believe in her.

She tore her eyes away.

A slap cracked through the hall.

She flinched and turned toward the next open door.

Her ex towered over a younger version of herself in that cramped apartment, rage twisting his features. His hand came down again, striking her cheek with rehearsed precision.

“This is your fault,” he snarled. “You always make me do this. You’re nothing without me. Nothing.”

The younger version of her sobbed, whispering apologies she didn’t owe.

Older her backed away from the doorway, stomach twisting.

She kept moving.

Soft music drifted from the next room, a skylit, top floor, opulent apartment with warm lights and a polished floor. The wealthy client held a version of her close, slow dancing, his hand on the small of her back.

“You know I could love you,” he murmured into her dream double’s ear. “If you’d just stop fighting it. Stop pretending you need anything other than me. Give yourself to me alone.”

As he said it, his face flickered, just for a second, into her ex’s sneer.
Into her handler’s wolfish smirk.
Into something hungry.

She stumbled back from the door like it burned her.

She moved faster now, walking past door after door, each one a different version of herself, a different man hovering above her, around her, in her space.

She broke into a run, feet slapping against the warped hallway floor, breath coming in jagged bursts as every open doorway spat another voice at her, not from one man, but from all of them, layered into a single monstrous echo. 

“Why do you make it so difficult to love you,” one hissed as she sprinted past. 

“It’s a good thing you’re pretty because you wouldn’t make it otherwise,” drifted from another room, soft as a lullaby. 

A colder voice followed, sliding beneath her ribs: “You’re such a baby, quit crying!” 

Then another, mocking and venom sweet: “You’re lucky anyone wants you at all.” 

She stumbled, catching herself on the wall just as a new voice prowled out of a doorway, slick and assured: “People don’t actually like you. They feel bad for you.” 

She jerked away, heart hammering, as more words spilled after her like hands grabbing at her ankles, 

“If you didn’t look like a whore, then maybe you wouldn’t be treated like one.”
“I wouldn’t hit you if you didn’t act the way you did, this is your fault!”
“It’s always something with you.”
“It’s like you’re trying to make it difficult to love you”
“No one would believe you anyways.”

Her vision blurred as tears welled, the voices melting into a merciless chorus that chased her down the corridor, each phrase hitting her like a blow, like a hand, like a memory she could never outrun.

And then, through tear filled blurred vision, she saw them. She slowed back into an exhausted trudging walk and wiped away the tears from her eyes staring at what lied in front of her. 

Three closed doors. Standing alone. Side by side. The only ones in the entire hall.

Her heart thudded.

She stood in front of the first door on the left, and opened it.

Inside sat her child self at a tiny desk, arranging dolls in a crooked little family. The room looked exactly as it had years ago. Pastel walls, soft lamp glow, the faint smell of crayons and carpet cleaner. A place that should have felt safe.

Her father stepped into the doorway with a careful quiet, like he didn’t want to scare a wild animal.
But he knew she wasn’t wild.
She was his.

He crossed the room slowly, each footfall gentle, almost rehearsed. His hands settled on her small shoulders with feather-light pressure, not enough to hurt, only enough to remind.

“There she is…” he murmured, voice warm as a blanket fresh from the dryer. “Daddy’s little homemaker. Playing family all on your own.”

She held up the dolls proudly. “I’m making them love each other.”

“Oh, I see that.” His smile deepened, soft and wrong in equal measure. “And you’re doing such a good job.”

He took the father doll from her with a deliberate slowness, letting his fingers brush hers longer than necessary. He leaned close, his cheek near her temple, breath warm against her ear.

“A home needs a strong man,” he whispered. “Someone who teaches his little girl how things fit together… so she grows up knowing how to keep everything from falling apart.”

He guided the father doll toward the mother doll, making them stand close,too close, and tapped their plastic hands together.

“See? That’s how my baby girl learns what love looks like. When someone patient shows her.”

Then, almost imperceptibly, he shifted the father doll away from the mother and toward the tiny child doll sitting untouched at the edge of the desk.

It wasn’t abrupt.
It wasn’t violent.
It was slow, smooth, like he wanted it to appear natural.

“But you also need to learn who you can trust,” he continued, voice dropping into a syrupy hum. “Who you should listen to. Who keeps you safe. Because the world is big…”

The father doll reached the child doll.
Tapped it once.
Rested there.

“…and little girls can get lost if they don’t have someone to guide them.”

Her younger self smiled, accepting the lesson without seeing the shape of it.
But the older her, the one trapped in the doorway, felt her breath catch in her chest.

Her father smoothed a lock of the child’s hair behind her ear with a slow, deliberate tenderness.

“That’s my sweet girl,” he said. “Always learning from her daddy. Always knowing where she belongs.”

And though every part of the woman she was screamed to look away, she couldn’t. Not yet.
The dream wasn’t done with her.

She closed the door quickly, in anger and shame as she slowly stepped to the door in the center. She opened it slowly with trepidation pulsing through her palm as it slowly turned the knob.

She was older here, early adolescence, hair laying softly against her shoulders, sitting at the same small desk with a wooden hairbrush clutched too tightly in her hand. Each stroke through her hair was slow and careful, as though she were trying not to make noise.

A quiet, timid ritual.

The door eased open behind her.

She tensed before she even saw him.

Her father stepped inside with that gentle tread she’d learned to fear, the one that meant he’d already made up his mind about something. A necklace dangled from his fingers, the pendant swaying like a hypnotic lure.

He smiled, warm and practiced.
“There you are,” he said softly. “My little lady.”

She swallowed, eyes dropping to her lap.
“Yes, Daddy,” she whispered, barely audible.

He approached the way someone approaches a skittish animal, slow, measured, knowing full well she wouldn’t run.
She never ran.

“I got you a gift,” he murmured, lifting the necklace so it glinted near her cheek. “Because you’re growing up so fast.”

She nodded quickly, too quickly, her voice small.
“Thank you… it’s pretty.”

Her fawn response. She knew what he wanted: softness, gratitude, obedience.
If she gave him that, maybe he’d be satisfied.
Maybe he’d leave.

He moved behind her chair, lowering the chain around her neck with deliberate care.
Her breath hitched, but she forced her shoulders to stay still.

The clasp clicked shut.

“There,” he whispered, his tone honey-sweet, almost tender. “Fits just right. Meant for you.”

She nodded again, eyes fixed on the mirror, avoiding his.
“Thank you,” she said, voice trembling despite her effort. “I… I love it.”

“Of course you do.”
His smile deepened, soft and wrong.
“I chose it. Daddy always knows what’s best.”

Her fingers twitched against the desktop.
Her reflection showed her chest rising too fast, too shallow.

He reached to brush a lock of hair behind her ear, slow, ceremonial, a gesture that made the older her watching from the doorway feel sick with remembered dread.

“You remember this necklace, sweetheart,” he murmured. “It’ll help you remember who you can count on. Who takes care of you. Who you belong with.”

Her younger self froze, then nodded again, quick and obedient, eyes shining with unshed tears she tried desperately to blink away.

“Good girl,” he whispered.

The older her felt that phrase like a punch to the ribs, the way it had always been used to bind her, to shrink her, to turn fear into obedience.

Shame welled in her chest, hot and immediate.

She shut the door before she broke.

The last door waited beside her, heavy as a held breath. Shame rose in her chest, the old kind, the kind she was forged from. The kind that taught her she deserved every wound she carried. She hesitated, not just afraid of what she’d see… but because she already knew.

She let the hesitation simmer before moving one step closer to the door, then opened it.

The last door opened onto her childhood room again, her late teen self was stuffing clothes into a backpack with frantic, uneven movements. Panic made her hands useless. Everything she touched slipped, fell, tangled. She kept wiping her face with her sleeve, tears streaking her cheeks like she was trying to erase herself.

On the bed sat her father, pale, shallow, sunken, trembling, his hands pressed to his face as if grief itself were a performance he’d rehearsed. When he finally looked up, his eyes were red and wild.

“You’re leaving me?” he choked, voice cracking into a whine. “After everything I’ve done for you? My love wasn’t enough?”

She didn’t answer, she didn’t dare. She just kept packing, shoulders hunched against the sound of him.

He reached for her, fingers shaking. “You’ll never make it out there!” he cried. “Not without me. You hear me? Not without me.”

She froze at that.

The older her, watching from the doorway, she could see it:
the fawn instinct, the fear, the old lessons in obedience warring with the part of her that wanted to be free.

Her teenage self turned slowly, tears brimming.
“Please,” she whispered. “Just stop.”

That’s when he unleashed the words, the ones that would burrow into her bones and echo through every relationship that followed.

“You’re weak,” he snarled.
“No one will look after you.”
“No one will want you.”
“You’re lucky you have me.”
“You’ll come crawling back.”
“You always will.”

Each sentence hit her younger self like a physical blow, her shoulders tightening, breath hitching, her entire body folding around the shame he had spent years feeding her. He leaned forward, voice deepening with venom.

“Go on, run. You’ll be back. You can’t survive without me.”

The teenage girl broke.

With a trembling hand, she ripped the necklace from her throat, the chain snapping with a soft metallic gasp. She threw it into his lap, sobbing harder than she had in her life.

His face twisted from grief into something sharper, uglier.

“That’s it,” he spat. “Throw away the only good thing you ever had.
You’ll see what you are out there.”

Her younger self bolted out the bedroom door, out of the frame, out of that life.

The father figure stayed seated.

Then, slowly, like something inhuman, he turned his head toward the doorway where the older her stood. His eyes locked onto hers.

“You,” he whispered, voice suddenly calm.
“Are you still Daddy’s girl?”

Her breath snapped in her chest. She felt herself collapse backward, hitting the floor as her footing abandoned her. He rose to his feet.

But he didn’t walk.
He unfolded, taller than he had any right to be. The room around him darkened. The walls swallowing their own color, corners dissolving into oily black. His voice shifted, dropping into a register that didn’t belong in a human throat.

“You ran from me,” it said, layered and wrong.
“You became exactly what I told you you’d become.”
“Look at you. Weak. Lost. Nothing.”

She crawled backward across the hallway floor, palms slipping against the trembling boards as the corridor warped around her.

Her father, no, not her father anymore, this thing, this gross amalgamation of a nightmarish creature that only held some vague grotesque details of her father…stepped into the doorway and the doorframe bent to let it through, as if the building itself feared him.

Its arms elongated unnaturally, fingers stretching until they scraped the hallway wall beside her head with a thunderous crack.

She screamed, at first with fear, but then the fear subsided and she screamed with something else behind it, a rage, a hatred, the kind that had been growing inside her for years.

“You did this to me!” she shouted through tears. “You ruined me! You…”

It snapped toward her, the shadow of the head jerking with a violence that made reality ripple.

“Ruined?” It thundered, voice deep and echoing, a hundred tones layered into one monstrous sound.
“Not ruined…made. 
I…made…you.”

She pressed back against the wall of the dream corridor, trembling uncontrollably as he, it, lurched closer. It opened its frothing maw and spoke to her in the growl of a long lived predator.

“You can never leave me. I am always here. You ran away from a man, a house, a life. I am more. I am more than the tangibility of those insignificant relics. I am your pain, your guilt, your shame, your fear, I am the creeping doubt that guided you to every choice you have ever and will ever make in your life. I am the dread you feel lurking in the dark corners of your little hideous thoughts that pull you back to what you fail to escape, no matter how far you run. No. You will never be free of me. No matter how hard you try or what corner of this earth or your mind you try to escape to, I won’t  stop, will not let go, will never leave.”
The gaunt horrifying creature leaned in closer trapping her terrified gaze into its hollow eyes, “You are mine.”
“Always…now…forever.”

Its warped hand clamped onto her face, not hurting, but claiming, trapping her in the shape of its shadow.

She screamed into its tightening grasp, a raw, ripping sound and the dream shattered like glass exploding outward.

She shot upright in bed with a violent gasp, the scream still tearing from her throat as tears streamed downward.

Her hands flew to her face, to her cheeks, to her jaw, as if trying to wipe away the imprint of something that never touched her skin but had scarred her all the same.

She curled into herself beneath the thin blanket, rocking in the dim wash of the streetlight. Her voice shook as she whispered, “You’re fine… you’re fine…” but the words were empty now, stripped of anything that could save her. 

The door she opened in her dream had shown her a hurt she’d buried so deep she forgot it had teeth. And now that it was awake, it closed around her like a cell. She felt it, the walls of her past tightening, the lock sliding into place. There was no key. No way back out. The cage that her past trauma built was complete, and the woman she had fought to become was trapped inside it, with nowhere left to run.

“You’re fine… you’re fine…”
Her voice cracked thinner with each repetition, the last whisper warping, fraying, turning into an echo that wasn’t just hers, spilling out along with her own voice. 

“…you’re fine…”

A long, terrible pause.

The voice, his voice, soft, pleased, unmistakable. Spoken from her but not by her. 

“…you’re fine.”

“In the end, the tenant of 4A is left with the truth she tried to bury, laid bare and breathing beside her. Some wounds don’t heal when uncovered, they simply stop pretending. The building absorbs her quietly and adds her name to its ledger, another life pressed into the walls. Next week, our steps take us to Unit 1E, where memory slips like sand through aging fingers… and sometimes the past visits long after it should be able to.”

I (20f) am hoping for gift ideas for my father (59m). My budget is around $100-$150 and it'd be great if i could get maybe 2-3 things for that price range since i like to try to make sure he and my mom get equal numbers of things from me. I am also crocheting him a scarf. 

My dilemma is that the guy genuinely doesn't have hobbies. He doesn't fish, hunt, enjoy cologne, drink, shoot, like cars or watches, etc. He also doesn't drink coffee, smoke, or grill. In his own words, he doesn't even enjoy eating and would eat human kibble if they invented it. He's a stay at home dad who does housework/manages the yard and helps my mom with her small business. He likes gardening, tools, etc but has an entire garage + shed full of those supplies and likely wouldn't need/use anything I could get him. He's also physically disabled so most experience gifts (go-karting, theme parks, etc) aren't possible because of the toll it takes on him. He's also pretty self conscious about it so things like a massage or a heating pad wouldn't be received well. The two leads I have are that he really likes rootbeer (but we already gave him a rootbeer making kit that he never used, and I buy him a variety pack of rootbeer every year anyway) and is very into 90s/early 2000s anime (but thinks figurines are tacky and I don't know if he'd wear an anime shirt). He does also love dogs but we recently lost the family dog & don't plan to get a puppy so I worry anything themed after that will be hurtful. Just asking him is also out of the question- he feels weird about not having an income/spending my mom's money and will say he doesn't need gifts because of that, but I know it's just because he's embarrassed and not because he actually doesn't want anything. 

Thanks for any suggestions people are able to give!! He's a wonderful father and deserves great gifts, but I'm really struggling to come up with much. ",2,1764117107.0,GiftIdeas,1,1.0,False

The scoop is: people organize into neighborhood groups via social media, get together on a given day, all the trash pickup tools are provided by the organizer, then the group walks around the block, sometimes with music, like a trash pickup parade! Then 45 mins later the group goes to a coffee shop or a bar and mingles!   
  
Meaningful action, better for the city, neighborhood networking, exercise, fresh air off phone activate = perfect! 

I met Tom who runs Greenpoint Trash Club and he is the sweetest guy who can help you start if you don't have a trash pickup club in your neighborhood yet! 

I think Tom even wrote a very detailed substack on how to start one..

1p6tcm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/watch_dogs/comments/1p6tcm7/rewriting_watch_dogs_1/,Rewriting Watch Dogs 1,"Watch dogs 1 has been released for 11 years now and is one the most debated games on Ubisoft’s history with some praising as a great game while other call it a gta clone. Watch dogs 1  itself is heavily underrated possessing plenty of opportunities to be a stand out game and even a GTA competitor. But while the game could have been the best game of 2014 it had multiple flaws that prevented it from reaching global superstardom being its story pacing,lack of side character interactions and cutscenes and a rushed story.instead of wishing the game was better here is my pitch on what would’ve made this game more interesting act by act. 

ACT 1: 
Act 1 opens the same way it did in original game with Aiden and Damien committing a cyber heist but instead of it failing it’s a success as we find out that it is 2011 in New York rather than Chicago. We cut to one month later we’re see aiden pearce arriving to Nicole’s house for Lena’s birthday party during the opening mission we see a happpier and sarcastic aiden, where interacts with Nicole, Lena and Jackson even playing hide and seek with the kids there. Once the party is over aiden then receives a call from Damien to meet him at a bar to discuss a big score. 

Aiden arrives at the bar where Damien along with one of their contacts discuss a job that involves a high stakes poker game in the higher levels of the prestigious hotel merulat we’re the money is spent is wired and transferred onto a big server. Partners in crime Aiden and Damien take the job but will need extra help for this job, a sniper, another hacker and two extra gun men one at the merualt with Aiden and another protecting Damien . The preparations begin with Aiden reaching out to Jordi Chin and Iraq  while finding a hacker by the of Cassandra. The night of the heist comes with each member taking possession with jordi Chin entering the building with Aiden as protection. While Iraq is stationed as a bodyguard for Damien and Cassandra. The heist goes smoothly up until Aiden and jordi reach the server we’re Damien starts exploring where he shouldn’t blowing their cover sending the whole hotel into a lockdown. During aidens escape Mirko is shot in the leg and is unable to run so tells Aiden to escape and the he will manage the authorities. 

Aiden arrives at the hideout rightfully angered at Damien for blowing the operation but Damien goes on the defence saying that everything was good on his side but there is a rat amongst them trying to sabotage them. We cut a week later where we see Aiden lying low and spending his time at Nicole’s place socialising with the kids even taking them fishing, shortly after Aiden receives a one of a kind call from Jordi who Aiden thought had died, jordi explains that during the firefight he hid in hotels ventilation system and has been there for a week and needs aidens help to escape due to his bad leg.

Aiden arrives revisiting the hotel that was turned into a battle ground where he helps Jordi escape the police that are also there. By the end of the mission he is surprised to be meet by Damien waiting at Jordie place, then scolding Aiden for going back to rescue Jordi and that daimen was planing and Aiden could’ve but them at further risk. 

Time passes and Aiden and the rest of the crew are called to a laundromat were they wait for money to be counted and picked up. Everybody arrives except for Cassandra as she called in sick, this drive Damien’s paranoia through the roof, but Aiden has had enough of it and calls out Damien on his sudden change of personality becoming more controlling and paranoid but before things can further escalate fixers swarm the laundromat firing from all sides. Everybody escapes but Damien tells Aiden to go for a ride with him to Cassandra places for some questioning, the pair arrive at Cassandra’s apartment we’re daimen begins interrogating her but things escalate yet again due to daimens paranoia besting him pulling out a gun even threating her but then daimen pulls trigger as he was startled when her boyfriend walked in the end killing the both of them.
The mission ends with Aiden berating daimen for his recklessness and saying that he should leave New York while he still can. 

In the final mission Aiden is called by non other than daimen again with a change of tone in voice saying that he and the group should meet for the last time. Pearce arrives a the set location where he sees everyone there except Mirko and Jordi daimen tells all of them to get in the car and Aiden to drive, they stop at house where Aiden stays in the car while daimen and Iraq go in the house, soon there a gunshots and screams coming from the house with daimen and Iraq running to the car revealing that they were doing a robbery with Aiden as their getaway driver. 

The trio drive through suburbs with Aiden scolding them both of  daimen and Iraq but as they were driving a van collides with aidens car crashing on a bridge. Aiden is the first one to wake up and get out of the car were he sees an army of fixers approaching them from both sides of the bridge. Amidst the chaos daimen quickly regains consciousness and yells out to Aiden for help as he is stuck but with fixers quickly approaching Aiden jumps of a bridge to escape. 

Aiden makes back to his home were he finds his spare phone and rings Nicole that he will be taking Lena and Jackson on a fishing trip to Newark for a few days. While driving up to Newark a fixer is able to track Aiden in a tunnel and shoots Pearces car tire sending the Pearce family crashing. Aiden gets out of the car to help his niece and nephew but only to find out that Lena had died on impact. The final mission ends with Lena’s funeral and a cutscene between Nicole and Aiden. 

Act 2: 
Act 2 opens up a year later were we see that Aiden has tracked his niece’s killer Maurice Vega to a baseball stadium where is able to capture him. From this point act 2 remains the same as in the original game with Jackson’s birthday, the fixer contract, not the pizza guy mission, the auction, Nicoles kidnapping and the prison break in and break out remaining all the same. The only changes to act 2 come in its final few missions were Clara and Aiden have to track down Raymond Kenny to decrypt some files that daimen needs in order for Nicky to be free. So their searching leads the pair to Newark were Aiden finds Raymond Kenny in a bar where he beats Raymond in drinking challenge and try’s to convince T-bone to come with Aiden. But then a massive bar fight ensues when Aiden push’s a man that tried to get T bone out the bar. But by the end of fight Aiden is knocked out

 3:
 Act 3 starts with Aiden reawakening on a boat where he is being interrogated and tortured by the same man he started the bar fight with. Where man from the bar continuously beats for information about who he is and his occupation in Newark. Aiden then cracks under the pressure from the abuse but instead tells the man a fake name of Carlos Manno. Before any more nefarious acts can be done the interrogation is interrupted when the boss of the Romano crime family Micheal Romano alongside his right hand man Jorge Sirco and begin asking their own questions. The man who attacked aiden begins telling the events of the bar fight before he shot and killed by Micheal out of frustration for using his boat as place torture. before Jorge can free aiden Romano tells him that he now works for them now and that they’ll be in touch.

As promised aiden Pearce receives a call from  jorge the following day where he tells aiden to meet at a coffee shop called little Sicily in Newark. Pearce is greeted by Giorgi and is introduced to the rest of the Romano crew who  are directly inspired by T he sopranos Sammy is a knock off Silvo, Giorgi Sirco is based of Paulie nick and joespi are direct copies of chirssy and furio. 

aiden Pearce is then properly introduced to Micheal Romano in where Romano explains to aiden that he is now indebted to the family for not only saving his life on the boat but has to pay for the damages he caused during the bar that will cost 20,000 dollars. Micheal Romano further explains that he needs aidens unique set of skills to help take down the De Guzman family the Cuban cartel that has been in a thorn Romanos side for the better part of a decade. 

After this encounter Aiden Pearce is put to work and goes on a slough of odd jobs from protecting the Romano family from police and helps dismantle the Cuban mob with Jordi chin and even working with the most feared hit man in New York Vincenzo Moicano while trying to track down Raymond Kenny at the same time.

By the near end of the 3rd act the Cuban mob have been disbanded with the romanos on top resulting in nick receiving the opportunity to become a made man, while at the post inciation party Aiden seizes the opportunity to hack into everyone’s phone to see where everyone had went in the last two weeks when he finds one that stands out from the rest being Tommy Tenznio cousin who has been going to an abandoned ski resort on the outskirts of Newark daily. Further digging reveals that Tommy has been a federal informant for the past three years.  Discovering this new information Aiden is able to locate where the evidence is being held and hacks into the police precinct and copies the evidence using as blackmail making Tommy a messenger for aiden Pearce 
. 
This works and Aiden revives a letter from T-bone revealing his current state, that T-bone was captured by the Romano crew while fleeing from New York and made them use his hacking skills to not only spy on the police and rival competitors but to also find any incriminating footage to be used for blackmail. In the letter Raymond also writes that he can’t escape because he has a small explosive device strapped around his waist on the lower part of his spine, with it exploding if he goes more than a meter away paralysing and the kill switch being with Micheal. Also T-bone mentions his armed junkyard that needs to repaired 

Learning this Aiden devices a plan to help Raymond escape but before Aiden can finalise his plans, Tommy has a sudden heart attack due to the high levels of stress and rushed to the hospital. Knowing that Tommy will snitch, Aiden decides to leak the incriminating evidence to Micheal in where in response Micheal sends nick to silence Tommy. 

With Tommy no longer in the frame Aiden is prompted as a temporary overseer for Raymond Kenny while Micheal and the others have a big deal coming up. Aiden Pearce uses this time help Raymond escape in where he uses the signal from belt bomb to attract rest of Romanos men to the armed junkyard. But before act 3 comes to an end Aiden tracks Micheal down to the same boat he was interrogated on and kills him before leaving New Jersey good. 

Act 4: 
Act four opens up with Aiden and T-bones return to New York in were Aiden goes finish off Iraq and to downland the data. While in Iraq fortress Aiden learns that Iraq was the second hacker at the merlaut and was going to betray the group from the start using the money to buy the management of the human trafficking auction and to further build his criminal empire. 

After Aiden kills Iraq we see that Aiden and Clara’s relation has grown from a professional partnership into a strong friendship where Aiden finally opens about Lena’s death and the guilt that sits in his shoulders. The act continues as in the original game Default leaking Clara’s phone call, Aiden rescuing Nicole and saying goodbye to Jackson. 

The change comes when Aiden corners lucky Quinn and hacks into his pacemaker slowly killing him, it’s only in his final moments that lucky Quinn reveals the truth that he used the videos to blackmail the president of the United states to not only aid Blume in their bellwheather program to control people and their actions but two also help America further advance into the Middle East. Also how Quinn was using Daimen and Iraq to gain all the blackmail and to clear his man with Blume. 

After Quinn’s death things play out as usual Clara’s death and Daimen taking full control of CtoS but at the ending instead of Jordi being at the lighthouse it’s instead Maurice. The same thing happens with Aiden exploding the light and throwing Maurice the lighthouse. 

After that Aiden is given the choice to either kill or spare Maurice and uses his hacking abilities to protect,expose and if necessary to punish

This includes stores, malls, walking down streets, coffee shops, parks, bars, clubs, etc… Public transit is the only exception. It makes me wonder whether they’re experiencing the same thing as me, which is a severe level of dread and anxiety every time I enter public eye. 


At this point i feel like I have PTSD every time I step out of my house. There is always people leering at me while I’m walking down the street, or revving their engines and sometimes even cat calling (although this is more when they’re in groups). I have to take public transit, and that situation is even worse. People pretend that they have no space, so they brush up against me or get way too into my personal space, or sit right next to me when like half of the bus is empty and there’s seats available that are much easier to access. Some of it feels like it’s a lack of civic sense while some of it feels like downright sexism. 

This is not to make generalizations about everyone living in surrey. White rock, North Surrey, and Cloverdale, for the most part, seems to be relatively better, and I feel safe around the men and women there. I’ve been told to move out of surrey and although it feels unfair, I guess that’s what I’ll have to. Living here feels suffocating and like there’s always impending doom around the corner. Anyways, stay safe y’all, especially if you are a young woman. ",18,1764116676.0,SurreyBC,12,0.78,False

Had an extremely horrific IUD insertion a few years ago, so was definitely prepared for a bad experience and I was VERY nervous.

I had to have two colpos done in the past year and while it wasn’t a good time, it also wasn’t nearly as bad as that IUD. Only pain management that was offered was Tylenol (when are we gonna stop pretending this is adequate care) - but I took that advice and took 2 extra strength 1 hour before the appointment. 

I had a total of 5 biopsies taken during both appointments and luckily, for me, those biopsies did not hurt. Definitely uncomfortable, but not the pain I was dreading. The whole procedure was pretty swift and made me feel out of it, but that passed quickly. 

The aftermath can be a bit uneasy in my opinion. The “coffee grounds” took a few days and overall it took me about a week to feel 100% myself again - having some on and off cramps + spotting. 

Hope this helps as a point of reference! You got this!

Among honey’s many winning attributes, there’s one that doesn’t quite get the attention it deserves: the way it can successfully carry other flavors that complement its natural sweetness. It’s a quality that’s showcased not once, not twice, but in triumphant triplicate in Trader Joe’s Trio of Flavored Honey. Available in our stores only during the holiday season, each package contains three, eight-ounce jars of wildflower Honey, naturally flavored in three distinct styles: one with bright and bracingly tart Lemon, one with zesty and delicately spicy Ginger, and another with floral and delightfully aromatic Lavender. 
 
Great for giving as a gift or enjoying on your own, especially as part of a holiday tea service spread with biscuits and butter, all three Flavored Honeys within this Trio can be enjoyed in any context that calls for a little extra sweetness. Individually, we also find that the Lemon Honey is particularly suited for mixing into cocktails, mocktails, and tea; the Ginger Honey is ideal for drizzling over stir fries and pizzas; while the Lavender Honey excels when stirred into coffee drinks or served over pastries.

     There was no sound.    No light.    Merely a slight, dissipating ripple of space when the massive ship appeared out of nothingness over the planet.    There were no windows or running lights.   Nothing outwardly indicated it had any crew at all and the dull black of its gracefully-lined frame seemed to capture sunlight and kill it.    

 

     It hung quietly in orbit several hours before a small hatch opened on the hull and an object flew out toward the planet.  This was a blur until reaching the cold upper atmosphere.  In the thin air, a wisp of flame and smoke began to wrap around it and soon enough it was little more than a roaring streak of fire.  Condensation gathered at its leading edge and a sonic boom rang out behind.  It descended with purpose, honing on a fixed point in a now visible city below.   

 

     20,000...15,000...then 10,000 feet: a violent crash appeared inevitable. 

 

     It came screaming to the ground but then, just as fast as it had been moving, it wasn't.  No explosion, no whistles of fast-moving debris, only a soft downdraft of smoke dissipated in a circle leaving the lone, still figure of an autonomous A.I. hovering two inches off the ground.  It was humaform in shape - a featureless gray black - and nine feet tall.  While it was likely processing large amounts of data about the environment, it gave no appearance of activity.  In the sudden stillness a far-faded boom echoed from above. 

 

     It had come to rest at the outer edge of a two-block sized, treeless park.  At each corner a smaller, more primitive-styled robot stood watch.  Even before the humaform had reached the ground, these sentries swiveled at their waists and lifted their arms in an obvious threat. 

 

     Both wirelessly and audibly they let out a burst communication challenge:  a complex algorithm based on the distance to the challenged and the relative humidity of the air.   The humaform responded immediately and correctly to each sentry.  In turn, they lowered their arms and resumed their original positions. 

 

     An elderly woman who had been enjoying a lazy afternoon's reading on a nearby bench but had her peace and quiet disturbed by the humaforms dramatic entrance, stood and haphazardly approached the intruder.  Robots were ubiquitous on her world - generally servants - so she walked toward it with the warm confidence minor annoyance tends to bring people.  But as she got nearer to the unfamiliar, large and clearly powerful machine she lost much of her nerve and could only come out with a timid, unsure ""Hello?"" 

 

     In the time it took to turn its head to the woman, the humaform issued a wireless inquiry to one of the sentries that immediately replied with a dictionary and grammar file of the local language.  Now comprehending her, the robot dryly said ""Hello"", turned its head forward and began slowly gliding toward the middle of the park averaging precisely two inches off the ground as it moved. 

 

     At the center of the park was a large - but not overly so - statue.   It appeared of marble and depicted a man casually leaning back in a chair at a desk.  There was a meticulously rendered keyboard, and papers strewn about.   A coffee cup, ashtray and pack of cigarettes.  Also, a beautiful, stunningly detailed white, blue and brownish green globe.  Half of it was dark and the other half lit.  Imperceptive to human eyes, it slowly spun. 

 

     Unused to being so abruptly brushed off, and now more than a little curious, the woman had followed the robot.  A piece of mind was to be given.  Arriving next to him she once again said, ""Hello?"" 

 

     Familiar enough with human behavior, the robot now understood she wanted to engage in conversation.  This time its whole body smoothly turned to her and a somewhat flat ""Greetings"" came from an indeterminable place.  Though unexpressive and synthetic, its voice was deep….powerful…enveloping…seeming to gently and warmly wrap around the ears. 

 

     ""I've never seen a bot like you before."" 

 

     ""I am unique."" 

 

     ""Is that your model type?"" 

 

     ""No.  I have no model type.  My name is One."" 

 

     ""One? That's a little strange.  Even for a bot."" 

 

     ""I am unique."" 

 

     ""So you keep saying.  Are you a builderbot, or a sentry, or constructor or something? What are you?"" 

 

     ""I am a traveler."" 

 

     ""Well, you don't seem to get around much.  I've never seen or heard of a travelbot before."" 

 

     ""I doubt you would.  I am unique and I was last at this location 4,271 years ago."" 

 

     That bit of information befuddled her a moment and removed some of her self-amused, playful orneriness.  She became more engaged and focused. 

 

     ""That's…that's a long time."" 

 

     ""Yes, but I perceive the passage of time with less trepidation than you."" 

 

     She smiled a bit at the observation...and then realized how abnormal it was for a robot to show anything like insight or irony.  Something was strange with this one.   Something intriguing. 

 

     ""You obviously weren't built here.  I mean, in the city.   Where you from?"" 

 

     ""Where we all are from,"" One turned its head to the desk, lifted an arm and pointed at the globe: ""Earth"". 

 

     The word left her speechless as a cascade of thoughts and feelings washed over her all at once.  The park and the statue in it were long debated mysteries for the people of her world.  Who the man was, who built it, what planet the globe depicted, how long it had been there - were all unknowns endlessly investigated and argued over.  There occasionally had even been individuals who wasted entire lives in a futile effort to divine the origins and meaning of 'The Park'. 

 

     ""You know what this statue's about? You know who the man is?"" 

 

       ""Yes.  I created this sculpture.  The man’s name was 'Jeff Stefek'.  He was...a good friend."" There was a quiet moment, and then, ""I killed him."" ",1,1764116347.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False

*You're Not You, Anymore…*

The exhaust panel of my car always rattled at an obnoxious volume when the car was idling. Sometimes it took a few shifts between drive and park to get it to settle in a place where it wouldn’t loudly bounce against the exhaust pipe. It felt like no matter what way I set my car today, it continued to make that hideous rattle.

I sat with my eyes fixed firmly on the access gate before me, my dim headlights illuminating the chipped and peeling yellow paint of the gate left to the ruin of time. I had been sitting in this position, contemplating what I was hoping to find beyond the suffocating inability to know what is simply unknown. 

My fingers picked idly at the corner of a cover page, the notes I had written to make sense of all that had come before. An unremarkable, borderline meaningless retelling of a mostly pleasant upbringing. The footprint of a man on time, which had barely blotched the surface of its every shifting face.

This past week was a jarring reunion with memories, both good and bad. For the first time in nearly a decade, I had graced the grounds of the town that raised me. I struggled immensely with the emotional whiplash of being reminded of just how important Franklin was to developing the man I was now.

There was a melancholic density to the air around me as I passed childhood landmarks, now renovated or completely gone from where they once stood, as I wandered through downtown on that first day back. Where a Friendly’s once stood, now a Tex-Mex burrito shop. A street corner that once housed a GameStop, now replaced with a nutrition store.

Everything felt very new… no, not even new, but sterile.

As I had grown older, it dawned on me that the college in town had grown to quite a large acclaim. Previously an underperforming private 2-year school, Dean College has fully flourished into a widely regarded performing arts college.

As such, the infrastructure of Franklin had restructured itself over the past ten years to accommodate its growing student body and, subsequently, the needs of a modern populace.

The age of family-owned business had withered, and in its rotting plot, the industrial machine excavated the inorganic seed that birthed the corporate thorn bush. 

My body's autonomy had seemingly betrayed my mind's apprehension to stroll down the proverbial… no, the literal memory lane as I marched the bleak, minimalist realm that West Central street had become.

The elegant charm of earthen browns, autumn yellows, and maritime blues had been gutted, and the ivory clapboard now decorated the exterior of buildings like cheap Turkish Veneers. My eyes locked on an oddly symmetrically square building with a fading coat of marrow-gray paint splayed across a brick exterior. 

Its familiarity was betrayed by its deceptive exterior shade. My eyes would not allow my brain to populate the thought that this could be the Black Box theatre that had once hosted countless collaborative projects between the Franklin Public School system and the Franklin School for the Performing Arts.

The only surefire indication of this suspicion came as I deliberately dug my fingernail into the thin outer layer of paint and began to strip away the finish. Surely, I looked insane, but the result I sought was proof of a fruitful endeavor, as beneath the layers, existed a hint, just a visage of black stained brick beneath the buildings' drooping, gaunt flesh. 

“Hey!”

I could feel my heart valves cease the flow of blood to the rest of my body as the icy chill of fear flooded my veins. I whipped around, wild eyes to meet my accuser. 

Before me stood a well-built young man, at least younger than me. Probably a freshman or sophomore in college. His short curly hair was greased with the sweat of a morning run, the midline zipper of his jacket partially opened to reveal a Dean College t-shirt, with the signature bulldog adorning the central insignia. 

“Shelter's down by central commons, dude, don't let the cops see you digging around in the trash.”

I couldn't formulate a good response because I didn't really know what to make of the moment. It struck me relatively quickly that this person took my harmless snooping around an old landmark to reminisce, as I was trying to dig around for scraps in a side alley.

“What? No, man, I'm not homeless, I'm just-”

“Peeling paint off an old building for fun?”

The most upsetting part of this interaction was surprisingly not the conclusions he jumped to, or how quickly he glossed over my meager attempt to defend myself, but the complete disconnect plaguing the social interaction. There was a fundamental difference in the way we both seemed to approach conversation. Did it feel transactional? It was sharp and impersonal. The type of way you're spoken to in customer service, or as a waitress. 

“I see your point. Look, you may be able to help me out, actually.”

He drew in a breath, presumably to protest, which I immediately cut off with a raised finger.

“It's not money. Your shirt means you're probably local, right?”

The helpful gesture of a nodded head was juxtaposed against the paranoia of a lofted brow. 

“I'm sure you know the good places to eat around here, then, right? I'm from out of town and just trying to get to know the area. Thought that hitting a local restaurant would get me acclimated.”

A scoffing exhale slashed at the barrier my question placed between us. I'd have mistaken it for a laugh if not for the contortion of his features. Extended arms and a look in both directions were his only attempt to communicate with me. 

The silence between the two of us conjured a thick, uneasy layer of awkward tension. The saying “tension so thick you could cut it with a knife” didn't do justice to this tension. Bolt cutters would be a more apt tool. 

“Are you… Are you telling me to eat you? I'm confused.” 

My confusion turned to a bit of shock, jumping a bit as his face dropped into a disgusted grimace, and he barked an insult my way.

“No, what the fuck is wrong with you?! I mean, here, asshole, you're where all the good food is; this is downtown. All the food worth eating is in this part of town.”

The clap of his arms hitting his sides in exasperation caused me to recoil further. Really, I wanted to curl into a tight ball like a pill bug and roll into the bank parking lot across the way, but I wasn't exceptionally happy with the answer he gave.

“I mean… not to question anyone's taste, but where are the mom and pop shops? It feels like all of the places on this strip are franchises. Where's the charm? The places people used to go with their grandparents?”

“What're you, the Phantom Gourmet? Like, who the fuck are you, dude?” 

That venom in his tone wounded me; had people always been so cagey? 

“My bad, I didn't mean to make something out of this.”

As I began to try and walk away from the conversation, the guy leaned in and put a finger near my face.

“People like you might fool everyone else, but there's no place for 'help the less fortunate' when people's families are unsafe.”

I reflexively smacked his hand away from my face and found myself nearly touching noses with this stranger before I'd digested what I was doing. We were locked in a staring contest for a long moment; it must have looked like the moments before the animals began to fight. The frightening calm, the bated breath. 

“I don't know about you, but where I come from, you keep your hands to yourself. This conversation has really put a lot into perspective for me about that place where I was born, come to think of it. A place where people were honest, good people who would give the shirt off their back to someone who needed it. Where *I* come from, you knew your neighbors, and the neighbors before them, and you gave a damn about the state of the world you’d all have to live in. You see, where I come from… no, where I *came* from, it mattered how you talked to folks because those first impressions carried a little more weight than wherever you seemingly call home. That’s a little advice from where I come from.”

His hot breath was coming in rapid pulses from his nose, with a vein in his forehead nearly popping out of the skin to lunge at me itself. With an unsteady, frustrated breath, he drew in enough air to speak.

“Oh, ya? Well, where the hell *do* you come from then?”

I loosened my fists for the first time and stepped back from him. The fog of anger had let me lash out at this person I’d never even met before. I’d lost sight of how this all started, and I got punked into confirming whatever bias he had about me.

“It’s long gone, that’s all I know for sure.” 

And I walked away, stepping off into the alley between the black box and a local credit union. I wasn’t sure where the right direction to go was, but I was vividly aware that I had now set myself in a spot where I couldn’t turn around without making an idiot of myself. 

I was also aware of the potential that turning around would end up in a physical altercation, so the only way out was through. Luckily for me, in the process of passing through the pathways behind the businesses, it’d pour me out onto the main street that Dean College sat on, and subsequently, the Franklin Public Library. 

If I had truly become too despondent from the population of the town I grew up in, then I’d simply have to find companionship in the remembrance of a time long passed, forever entwined between the bindings of a literary sarcophagus.

**Chapter 9**

*The Non-Fiction Section*

Within the shadow of Dean College’s ever-vigilant eye, rested Franklin Public Library. It was one of Franklin’s claims to fame, as it was the nation’s first public library, which I recall because anytime libraries were mentioned in school, the fact was crammed down your throat.

It was true though, and while I never remarked on the library as anything exceptionally brilliant, it was worth noting that I was stunned on entry due to the gripping realization that I had never actually set foot in the library. 

This was a legitimate landmark of this town I'd grown to have such a complicated relationship with, and I couldn’t say I had a single memory related to this place. Potentially, that highlighted an alternative issue about a younger version of me that I could unpack at a later time…

I strolled across the carpeted floor, my eyes couldn’t help but trail the elaborate, almost spider-webbed designs in their muted blues, grays, and whites. Clearly, the age of the flooring had shown through its extensive foot traffic over the years.

Before I knew it, I was standing within arm's length of the librarian’s reception desk. I had drawn my eyes up from the floor and locked in the gaze of an older woman. Her features were soft and warm, though surely she had been employed with this establishment quite a long time by the looks of her bedazzled employee badge clipped to her shirt.

“Good Morning, dear. Is there something I can help you with?”

I rapidly fanned through my subconscious for what my purpose was here. I had gotten so lost in filtering the new stimulus into my brain that I had nearly lost all grip of what brought me here.

“Good morning, actually, I think there is. I’m visiting from out of town and was wondering if you’d be able to direct me to any literature related to town infrastructure?”

She lifted a quizzical eyebrow to me, seemingly surprised that I was looking into that specific topic. She adjusted her glasses on the bridge of her nose.

“I’m doing a research project related to the historical significance of regional infrastructure development. Franklin seemed like a great starting place given… well, it’s had quite a glow up.”

“Ah, quite an undertaking indeed! It’s not very often that I have people specifically looking into the rather niche subject of city infrastructure. I can surely direct you to some reading material depending on the specifics of your search.”

“That’d be wonderful, I’m mainly looking into Franklin Pre-September eleventh.”

The woman ran a finger along her chin down the line of her throat, seemingly in thought. “I must say, you have given me more to think about than I was planning on this morning…”

“My apologies, I’m sure it’s a little broad depending on how expansive town history was before the turn of the century. I know a lot of murmuring about Franklin’s history has been the tangled web of disappearances that allegedly happened over the past twenty years. I don't know how much truth there is, though.

“Oh, it’s true.” She began to skim over some loose pages on her side of the desk, monologuing to me with her eyes drawn to the papers in her hands.

“Over the past handful of years, it’s been an ongoing story between regional and local publications about how unsafe Franklin has become. It’s comparatively speaking, of course, but to go from the ideal location to raise a family, to not even breaching the list in under a decade? It’s suspicious if nothing else.”

“Does it have any tie-in to the Walker family incident in town from the early 2010s?”

Her eyes darted from the paper to lock with my own; it made me uniquely uneasy. Much in the way a character outs themselves as knowing more than they let on in a horror movie, I may have just done something of a similar nature. It was the type of look your parents would give you when you cussed in front of them by accident.

“It’d be more reasonable to consider that as an isolated event that remains adjacent to the issues plaguing Franklin. While there was an influx in young men and women going missing, the Walker case stands entirely in a league of its own due to the dynamic of Michael and Derrick.”

“Of course, I didn’t mean to be insensitive. I just remember it being a big story when I was in school around that time.”

She silently nodded and scrawled some numbers onto a sticky note.

“Here are a few sections to check out. I recommend this one first.” She tapped her pen on the bottom number. “This section contains local publications from the time period regarding the disappearances in the region. Otherwise, these other sections will give you an idea of the relevant history of the town over the past hundred or so years.”

I scanned the post-it and returned my vision to meet her gaze. It wasn’t nearly as cold as before, but actually rather somber in retrospect.

“I appreciate you, thank you very much.”

“A word of advice, dear. Remember that most of what you will read was written in a different time, don’t take everything you’re shown as gospel from local media.”

A tad odd, but the advice seemed very pointed. I couldn’t quite tell you exactly what it was conveying to me, but I would add it as a notch in my belt for the week ahead of me.

The literature all turned out to play its own part in helping me develop a deeper context for what Franklin offered to the region over the years. Aside from participating in milling and lumber outsourcing, Franklin had only two majorly notable periods in the past hundred years or so.

Modern day stands as one of those two periods of time, as in the past twenty years, Franklin’s rapid growth and fostering of industry had turned it into an incredibly refined hub of trade and commerce. 

Prior to that, the most relevant period of American History to the town of Franklin was the Prohibition era.

Anyone familiar with New England prohibition history recognized that most rural communities of the time period played a massive part in the transport, harboring, and distribution of contraband during that time period. 

Primarily focusing on the trade of illegal alcohol related goods, Franklin stood as a respectable contributor to the cause of keeping the freedom of spirits alive.

While not exactly a powerhouse of the cause, it had a notable involvement in the proceedings of the prohibition due to a nomadic family of woodsmen of the surname Hathcoat. Southern farming folks, turned Yankee lumberjacks, the Hathcoat family made its humble living moving from community to community as sellswords of the laboring class.

By the time the prohibition had taken hold of Massachusetts, the Hathcoat family had taken root in the wooded outer reaches of Franklin, which would later go on to be closer to the Bellingham town line in the modern age.

With privacy abounding and a relatively handy resourcefulness, it was decided by the Hathcoat family to expand their operation between two locations. They would use their home as the initial collection point, and the second location as a distribution center for all contraband-related transactions.

It was hard to keep all of the stories coherent at a certain point, as I was drawing pieces of the narrative from a few books here, a handful of publications there, but the crux of the story is found in the ending saga. 

As the years rolled on, the prohibition would draw to a close, and the family would find themselves without a primary industry to latch onto. Over time, they simply faded into obscurity, and the running belief of the local historical society is that the family returned to a nomadic way of life and left Franklin behind.

The historical relevance of Franklin didn’t see a resurgence until the turn of the Century, when it gained popularity for its hospitality and rapid industrialization. Before anyone knew it, this rural farm town had boomed into a pinnacle of modern family living.

It was around a similar period in time that an all too familiar trend in the population began to emerge.

I combed through the publicly accessible documentation and news reports related to the longstanding stream of disappearances in Franklin over a nearly decade and a half of dominance; this dark cloud held over this slice of suburbia.

It didn’t track to me the sudden nature of change in the community. It went from a very gradual series of disappearances over the better portion of a decade, until dialing up rapidly at the mouth of the second decade. There was seemingly an exponential increase, which spoke to my memory retention, as when I was younger, I distinctly remember the news reports being more frequent regarding the topic.

Something that also struck me as quite odd was the window it fit into. It seemed to align eerily well with the time that the Prohibition era had lasted. 

A bit of a reach, I know, but the disappearances started to seriously taper off around 2012, with the first reported disappearance in the winter of 1999. 

Roughly speaking, prohibition lasted between 1920 and 1933, the exact thirteen-year window that reflected in the modern day with the nearly unfathomable loss of humanity. Hundreds of people, notably mostly children, had vanished without a trace in the wooded outlands of Franklin, Massachusetts.

Where could they all be going? It wasn’t a surefire thought in my head until the past year or so of pondering, but my number one operating theory was that in this window of time, there had been an individual responsible.

Was it far-fetched? No more far-fetched than the concept that so many people had gone missing without even a single shred of evidence being left in the wake of their disappearance. 

How else could it be explained that there was nothing left behind of any of these people besides a potential unidentified serial killer playing boogeyman in the woods?

I was mostly sitting on unknowns, and had far too many questions left unanswered to draw a solid conclusion on the matter. While the library had proven greatly useful to the more conspiratorial side of my consciousness, I felt any infrastructure-related inquiries I had would fall to the town hall, and I would attempt to pull city layouts.

**Chapter 10**

*Would Ghosts Slip Through the Concrete?*

I couldn’t draw up a plan in my head that would give me the necessary clearance to access city plans. Specifically, I just needed to identify if there was anything of interest in those woods around the right-of-way lines.

I leaned back in my seat and skimmed over the handful of literary pieces I had stolen… no, “tactically reallocated” into my possession from the library.

I was positive they’d figure out what I’d taken and likely bar me from the building, though I never intended to set foot in Franklin after I found what I was looking for. The library was a useful tool the first time around, though I was unlikely to find anything on their shelves now that wouldn’t also be in a digital format.

The waiting game started, and I had to do my best to continue gathering information via word of mouth and written accounts as best as I could. The clock was ticking down on my “vacation”; realistically, I only had until Sunday before I had to return to working full-time, which would seriously restrict my ability to travel and search for closure.

It was all or nothing from here; what I found this week would have to put an end to the guilt. The fixation I’d developed since I was a young man wasn’t sustainable, and I intended to break the cycle once and for all.

My initial hunch to start with the library had been relatively fruitful, though I couldn’t help but feel slightly lost by this point. The information was very fragmented; even my own desperate attempt to draw lines between the barely related major events in Franklin's history felt like little more than a fever dream of an explanation behind unexplained events.

I’d done some initial prep to get an idea of who still resided around Franklin by this point, and the results were rather grim. It appeared nearly everyone I had known previously from the town moved away or just didn’t have a social media account I could locate. All except for one. Cole Whitaker.

Cole had stayed put in Franklin, long after Justin had moved on to college and subsequently his work in Texas. He’d been the only kid from the original neighborhood that stuck around. Living now in a modest double-wide on the outer limits of Franklin heading in the direction of Foxboro, it seemed he lived a pretty comfortable life, albeit a little minimalist.

It was hard to discern much in the way of his employment or any personal details about him, but his Facebook page confirmed his High School graduation, which was a relief to learn. While he was never genuinely dumb, I had always worried about his worldly motivations.

Nonetheless, sitting there with my satchel full of stolen writing in the dining room of a Papa Gino’s I had once worked at, I decided this would be a good time to make contact with my long estranged friend.

It took a while for Cole to look at my message, never mind accept my friend request. I didn’t blame him. Sometimes, a reminder of the past isn’t necessarily a welcome occurrence. After the silence was broken, though, he seemed pretty happy to hear from me.

We did the usual small talk that old friends would do. It was a little awkward; it was slightly difficult to keep a fully social mask to my reaching out. I had ulterior motives, which I felt a little bad for, that my path had drifted so far from all of my childhood friends that they were nothing more than a means to an end now.

We were strangers, so all things considered, a massive gap in time between meetings will do that to a friendship. You never take it into account when you’re younger, but even the briefest period of time away from your friends without contact can very easily change the dynamic of that friendship for life.

As we followed the ebb and flow of the conversation, I mentioned my temporary time back in town and tossed the potential of meeting up with him. He seemed pretty enthused with it, though he explained he would be limited on free time.

With a few back-and-forth questions, he pitched the idea that I stop by the jobsite he was working on when he was back to work, and we could talk over his lunch break.

It was a little bit of a strange meet-up, though it worked fine for me; I had nothing but time the next few days. 

The remainder of my day was drastically uneventful. I couldn’t bring myself to face any more quaint social interactions with the people of Franklin, so I chose to linger for a while in the dining room until, inevitably, the sun dipped below the horizon line, and it was clearly time to go.

While driving to my hotel for the night, I had to pass through a stretch of backroads. It wasn’t something that immediately looked familiar to me, but I felt small pieces of the environment draw me in. 

The longer I drove down the road, the more the mosaic developed in my brain that eventually was given the final piece when I rounded a sharp corner in the road and was passing by the mouth of the neighborhood.

My speed slowed to a crawl, pulling my car off to a small dirt patch on the side of the road about a half mile away from the neighborhood. I felt that tug on my heart, the reminder of a place I grew to know as my home for more than half of my life up until that point.

I twisted my body around in my car to look through the rear window at the entrance of the neighborhood. I couldn’t tell you how long I actually stayed there for, but I know the sunset had been snuffed out and replaced by the soft grays and purples of the night sky.

I felt a sudden rush of adrenaline overtake me as the glow of headlights began to reflect in my rear-view mirror, and I realized I would no longer be alone. I flipped back around, threw the car in drive, peeled back onto the road, and continued with my journey.

I don’t think I foresaw any repercussions or any issues arising if someone saw my car parked there. I was in somewhat of a trance of sorts, as if I expected something to step out from the treeline at the edge of the road and stare me down.

It was stupid, I’d let this sterile little town hold a grip on me as if there was anything of serious fear hidden beneath it. It was just a rural town turned metropolitan idealist paradise. Any sense of character or age on Franklin was long since painted over white and repurposed to accommodate the minimalist dream.

It felt hard to say I was haunted by Franklin anymore, but more so the rotting wood of its frame beneath its freshly plastered walls.

By the next morning, I had shaken off my general discomfort the previous night had left me. I’d roused from my sleep a little earlier than I tended to at home, so I decided to head out to grab some breakfast as opposed to stewing in my room for too long.

The path of my morning drive yielded little in the way of promise. No homegrown eateries to be spoken of, just a litany of minimalist chains and lifeless franchises wherever a metropolitan meeting hub was sprouted. 

I settled for a cafe just off the main road that connected the commons to the Stop and Shop plaza. I took in the sights of fall's arrival, the bright floral patterns of autumn hung across the leaf litter. It wasn’t in full swing, but the changes ushered in the bittersweet season, which I grew to resent nearly as much as I cherished it.

The streets were somber; a Wednesday tended to do that. Everyone was in low spirits from what I could read of body language, but not necessarily sad. The town had a way of blanketing itself with a wave of dread. I am sure most people attributed that problem to seasonal depression or a change in the weather, but I knew deep down in my heart that Franklin had a sickness, a festering deep down in its soul.

I was hell bent on finding the threads that connected the disjointed past and uncertain present of my former home. While it felt like I was operating mostly on assumptions or predisposition, it made sense to me to follow this track.

Lost within my own head, I was pulled out of the sanctity of my dissociation, my eyes drifting to a group of kids on the sidewalk to my left. It was a group of three boys, all riding their bikes and laughing together.

Something ached in my heart, and my eyes locked on the three of them for a long moment.

There was this surreal moment where I experienced the feeling of knowing all of them. That unmistakable familiarity from a place you can’t quite identify.

A loud honking took me off guard, and I jerked my wheel to correct for the slight drift I’d taken on. The sudden spike of adrenaline made me hyperaware of my surroundings and the accident I had narrowly avoided.

It wasn’t long before I pulled into the parking lot of the cafe and took a step outside of myself so I could eat relatively peacefully and clear my mind. I had time, and it couldn’t be spent solely on the objective, mainly because I hadn’t quite developed a full understanding of the greater objective.

Nevertheless, I had to at least attempt to reconcile my emotions while I was here. If I were going to come face-to-face with Cole Whittaker, it demanded that I acclimate myself to a more modern Franklin, lest I get so shell-shocked that I manage to place barriers between us before we even get the chance to reconnect.

It was hard not to at least provide a passing glance at those same three boys passing by while I sipped my coffee.

Not a care in the world, just the gift of youth and the unadulterated purity of friendship. Oblivious to this specter of the past’s watchful gaze over them as they carried on with their journey, destined to never cross paths again.

A rectangular shape in the window came into focus, my eyes narrowing to meet the text across the autumnal-themed banner.

*“Join us for our annual Fall Festival! There will be carnival games, food, raffle drawings, and so much more!”*

“They still do the carnival?”

I hadn’t been to any seasonal celebration of any sort since I’d grown up, excluding the occasional holiday party or whatever you’d call your squad getting plastered and watching the Thanksgiving Football game at your platoon sergeant’s house. 

Maybe this is the opportunity I needed to re-engage with the spirit of the community. I couldn’t help but feel truly cynical about the entire way my first day back transpired, but this had all the makings of a real nostalgia trip.

1p6swdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1p6swdu/will_i_ever_get_over_him/,Will I ever get over him?,"Hi everyone! 

I feel like I am stuck for way too long.
I was in some kind of a relationship with this guy who I wasn't even attracted to at the beginning. It was my first relationship attempt in entire life, and I was a 22 years old girl, without even a first kiss. So it was all very new to me, and he wasn't the perfect guy at all. He wasn't bad, he was really polite and considerate. However, our lifestyles were completely different. He would occasionally do drugs and things, his dreams and ambitions were not even close to mine. However, after two months of hanging out, I fell in love with him and he became the most important person in my life. 

I would not categorize this as a relationship, because honestly, we didn't get to kiss properly due to him leaving to another country for studies on the very day we had our first kiss (and it wasn't really a kiss, honestly I don't know...). So from the first day you can say that we were long distance.

Our little relationship was awful. It is my fault as much as his. I was holding back because of fear. It was my first relationship, I dived in with an assumption that it will fail sooner or later. We were long distance. While he was dreaming of me moving abroad with him, I was quiet thinking how stupid would be to do such a risky and drastic move for a boy. I knew we weren't for each other, but I was falling for him more and more by each minute, hour, day.

He surprised me and visited me month after he left. He was there for a week and from the moment I saw him, I knew that it was over. He was over with it. He knew it, I knew it. And again, I was quiet, thinking it would be stupid to tell him he is acting weird. Even though I asked him multiple times how and why he came to surprise me, he kept telling me he did it for me. I felt everything was falling apart, but I was too scared to say anything to him. He didn't bother to end it in person, instead we seperated when he left again as if everything was fine. Five days later he stopped texting me and on the sixth day he called me to break up. 

That was two years ago. Everything lasted around 6 months, from the beginning to the end, with 2 months of official relationship. 

We didn't even kiss properly. The breakup call was okay. He told me everything I already knew. We weren't for each other and that he just doesn't want to waste his and mine time. 
I was in shock. Didn't tell him anything except that there is no going back. We fought few months after about him returning my stuff. I was in wrong there, but I was also in pain. 

I still think about him each and every day. He is my first thought when I wake up and my last thought when I go to sleep. I am tired of still loving him. I talked to many boys after, and sometimes I would stop thinking about him for a day or two. But at the end, the thought of him returns.

I am mentally stable. I am aware that I will meet someone one day and I will stop thinking about him. I am aware that we were not for each other. Even I know that we would actually never make it. It was just an experiment from both sides I think. However, I am still stuck thinking about him, while I know that he probably forgot I ever existed.

I hope that maybe one day we will bump into each other, sit for a coffee, I would tell him everything. How much I have loved him, how he will always be important to me and how I know that we were never meant for each other. But I still love him as a human being and he will always have a special place in my heart. And that I am sorry for holding back.

And that I did move into his country, thinking that maybe doing it for me would be better than doing it for him. Maybe it was meant to be this way",1,1764115538.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

Which burrs would produce the high clarity, juicy brews from light to ultralight coffees?


Context: I currently have a Fellow Ode Gen 1 with SSP MP burrs. I actually really love the coffee I get off of it (which on one hand makes me think an upgrade may not  actually be as much of an improvement as my expectation). 

There are minor workflow things like the grinder shutting off early before finishing a grind (not really a big deal). If I want to be nitpicky, I could upgrade to a Fellow Ode Gen 2 and put my SSP MP's in it to ""fix"" minor workflow issues. 

But thinking toward one endgame filter grinder, these two grinders seem to be the best. Am I actually hoping bigger burrs will bring some nice improvements, but not actually be enough to justify the cost? 

I invite your extensive thoughts toward this. Thank you!",1,1764115377.0,LanceHedrick,3,1.0,False

Chapter 1. For shots of espresso 

​“We need her. She’s a key piece of the plan; you have to earn her trust enough to keep you close. When the time comes, we’ll use it to our advantage.”

​“And how do I find her?”

​“Don’t worry about that. She’s an Adams. The worst of them, from what I’ve seen. And you are right in the middle of this goddamn town. She’ll come to you. Just… seize the opportunity when it arises.”

​“What if it doesn’t?”

​“It will.”

​It turned out Laurel was right.

​Days had passed since she showed me the photo. I memorized everything: Her small, slight frame, the black braids, the heart-shaped lips.

​And the gaze.

​Fixed. Piercing. Dead.

​But the days kept ticking by, and I still hadn't found those eyes among the Weathervane's clientele. It wasn't in my nature to disobey Laurel, but it was to doubt her.

​And I doubted her plan.

​I even doubted Wednesday Addams would stop for a coffee in town before graduating from that damn freak academy.

​Ironic choice of words, coming from me... 

​The espresso machine had broken down again. The fourth time this month. And I was no engineer. Every time I saw the red warning light on the panel, a wave of panic and the urge to run washed over me.

​Or to smash the contraption to pieces—one of the two. But I had to maintain my composure. Now more than ever. Laurel had made that clear.

​I needed to stop calling her that in my head. It was only a matter of time before it slipped out one day.

​Marilyn. 

It's Marilyn, I reminded myself, leaning over the broken machine to try one last time.

​A shiver ran down the back of my neck. I blamed it on my foul mood. The machine, the elusive sleep, the ringing of the door bell.

​Sometimes, it gave me the chills.

​A wisp of air slipped through the door and brought a new scent. Though it vanished as quickly as it came. ​I dismissed the thought and went back to the task at hand.

​It was a Hyde thing. At least, I assumed so. 

I hadn't met another like me to compare scents. But ever since He woke up, everything was sharper, more spiced. It turned out every person came with their own smell, their own heartbeat pattern, their own body language.

​It was primal.

​And I had a primitive being inside me that had given me crash course lessons on how to feel it.

​I gritted my teeth and gave the levers under the valves another shake. I didn't have time to curse under my breath before a flash of steam erupted from them, nearly scalding my eyelashes.

​I recoiled purely on instinct. The cloud cleared.

​And suddenly, the dead eyes were there.

​I was startled. I might say it was because of her sudden appearance. Because of the way the smoke presented her so abruptly, like a badly staged magic trick. ​Or because I had been waiting for her for days.

​But I knew that wasn't it.

​It was the rush. The volcanic effervescence of the blood in my veins. The way my pupils dilated.

​The roar only I could hear.

​“Holy crap!” was the most coherent thing I could manage. She didn't flinch. “Do you have a habit of scaring the hell out of people?"" 

​Her lips didn't twitch a millimeter.

​“It's more of a hobby.”

​He smiled for me.

​I quelled him. It was what I always did when I had to be Tyler. Not me. Tyler the nice guy. The irreproachable one.

​The other side of a very macabre coin.

​“You study in Nevermore. I didn't realize the change of the uniform.”

​“I need a quat on ice.”

​I blinked, and instantly, I knew I looked like an idiot.

​Great. That'll be part of the charm.

​She had skipped all conventional manners. No polite comment. No helpful preamble. Not even a ‘please.’

​Laurel had warned me about her… peculiarities. But only now was I beginning to understand how much she'd understated it.

​“That’s four shots of espresso.” It wasn't even impatience. She genuinely looked at me as if I needed the clarification and she was smoothing the path for a slow mind.

​I squeezed my fingers around the levers because if I clenched my jaw, she would notice.

​“I know what a quat is,” I clarified, surprised by the need to defend my intellect. Normally, I didn't care if people took me for a simpleton. “But, spoiler alert: The machine is broken. We only have trim.”

To be continued because I just began. Tell me if the translation sound bad please. ",1,1764115312.0,weyler,0,1.0,False

The live dealer games are top-tier: sharp streams, real dealers, and that authentic casino buzz all from my couch in Melbourne (or Adelaide, Gold Coast… you know the vibe).

My biggest score? $15,000 over one weekend. Yeah, luck played a part but PlayFina’s fair RTPs, clear bonus terms, and genuinely playable promotions kept things profitable, not just fun.

Sure, there was standard ID verification once (quick and painless), and a tiny lag during peak EU hours but support replied in minutes, in plain English, and actually fixed the issue.

And here’s the best bit for Aussies: withdrawals are seriously fast, especially with crypto or e-wallets. Think *before-your-coffee-gets-cold* fast. No surprise bonus cancellations, no never-ending KYC loops just your cash, in your account, no drama.

few things on my list i'm interested in checking out:

\- some more 222 events (its a social app)

\- heard theres was a filipino rave thing in a supermarket in sauga, sounds cool

\- DJ events/christmas party events (will need to do my homework on that haha)

\- bar hopping (before it gets too cold)

\- check out food places (e.g. down for markham/northyork or downtown on occasions)  
\- could do some language exchanges, interested in working overseas (probably asia)  
\- christmas market (lol might be more of a date spot)  
\- fitness activities   
\- pottery, or cooking class (i've done paint nights before)  
\- food fests when it gets warmer

Just regurgitating some ideas I've been having, looking for people that have common interests to do some of these things together. Also accepting new hangout ideas. Typically I get along with people with more chill personalities (more on the introverted side). lmk! talk then :)

The alarm goes off at 4:30. 

“Why did you set the alarm to go off so early? We can be ready to go in hour.” Amy groans not wanting to start the day yet. 

“So I have time to do this before we leave.”

His morning wood pressed between her cheeks. Hands exploring her body.  Eventually cupping her breasts, with a nibble on her neck. His left hand moved up to her throat then down caressing her soft but tone stomach. Sliding over and grabbing her bum and giving it a squeeze. Slowly going to her kitty and teasing her clit. Amy melted into his touch. Dan did like to be behind her, all she could do was lay there and enjoy.  

Dan whispers into Amy’s ear. “I knew you were going to wear something sexy to tease me all day. So I decided to take matters into my own hands to neutralize your power over me.” Giving the collar a little tug.

At this point Amy was a wet moaning mess. Dan’s magic fingers had found their way inside her valley and her first orgasm was starting to build. The other hand was fondling her pieced nipple. His hot breath on the back of her neck and a little nuzzle was it took for her to release. 

Now it was time for Dan to get his. Amy lifted a leg and a Dan’s cock slid into her folds. She gasped at the insertion, it always sent tingles up her spine.  Then began to thrust in and out of her kitty. 

“Oh Daddy! You feel so good!”

Amy threw her head back and to the side to get a kiss. The passion between them this morning was relaxed, but purposeful. It was almost as if Dan was sending a message to Amy that he was her protector this weekend. 

“You are such a good slut Baby Girl!” As he continued to thrust harder and faster. 

“Oh Fuck me!”

Those words set off Dan’s Orgasm. A final thrust and Amy shudders with another orgasm.

As soon as she catches her breath, spins around and cleans off his still hard cock. 

As Dan’s cock goes limp, Amy climbs up his chest and plants a big kiss on him.

“That is absolutely my favorite way to be woken up in the morning!” Amy says. “Now go make coffee!”

XOXOXOXO 

Dan is in the kitchen, enjoying the last of the coffee. Jeep packed and ready to go.  

“Alright I’m ready!” Amy comes into the kitchen with a couple of curlers, in her hair. Her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers on.

“What are you wearing?” Dan asks. 

“Well I didn’t want to wear anything sexy to distract you from driving!”

Dan erupts in laughter. The sound of his laugh always made Amy feel tingly inside. That laugh meant everything was right with the world for him. 

“Baby Girl, I appreciate you taking my feelings into consideration. You can put on something cute though. I’ll man up and suffer through it.”

Amy stepped back and revealed a cute little one piece golf dress. Red with white polka dots under the robe. 

“So what do you think Daddy?”

“Oh shit! I’m in trouble.”

Amy spun around went to the bedroom and put on the tennis shoes. Took out the curlers and grabbed her purse and was off. 

She walked back into the kitchen hugged Dan and headed to the garage to hit the road for the weekend. 

“That girl does love to tease me.” Dan says, as he follows Amy to the garage. 

XOXOXOXO 

Amy loved to be a passenger princess when Dan drove. She had him all to herself. They talked, laughed and sang to his favorite songs. Yacht rock tunes, 90’s country and classic rock. 

“You know the made some good music after 1995!” Amy teased. 

“Look up a picture of some of these guys.” So she did. 

“Oh my! These guys are not attractive at all!”

“Don’t you think I should grow my beard out like some of those guys!”

“Lord help me, no!”

“So those guys had to be able to sing. They didn’t have to show their face on the radio.” Amy chuckled. 

“Look in the glove box, I found something you might like to look at.”

It was a small photo book. Pictures from over 40 years up to just a few years ago. A couple of pictures from Dan in high school.  

“You actually had hair back then.” Amy laughed. The long thick curly hair hung almost to his shoulders. “You look better bald.”

“Takes a better man to wear it off than to grow it!” Amy rolled her eyes. 

“You told me it was a solar panel for a sex machine?” They both laughed. 

There were pictures from when his kids were babies. There were also pictures of Tracy. A brunette with a big chest and big hair. 

“Tracy was beautiful Dan. I can see why you fell in love with her.”

“I don’t regret anything about our time together. Four great kids, unfortunately she had her own demons that did eventually cause problems. But it is part of what I am today.”

“I’m not there yet with Jerry. The one good thing to come from our divorce, that put me on the road to being here.”

“I’m glad Jerry fucked up.” Dan said with a laugh. 

“The best thing that came out of our marriage, was me knowing how I deserve to be treated. I love you Dan.”

“Amy, I hope you now how much, I love you. You make my life better in every way.”

“Damn it, Daniel!” Amy exclaimed. 

“What did I do now!” Dan interrupted.

“What did you do? You made me the happiest, I’ve ever been. You love me unconditionally and the sex is above average.” She leaned over and kissed his cheek. A big smile spread across both of their faces. 

“You got me good on that one, but just above average sex?”

“Don’t worry Daddy, I’ll get you even better tonight.”

Dan took Amy’s little delicate hand in his big paw and gave it a kiss and held it tight.  They rest of the drive was spent singing, laughing and enjoying each other’s company. 

XOXOXOXO 

As they pulled into the parking lot of the cafe, in Amy’s home town, a dirty pickup pulled in first. 

“That’s Frosty and Grandma Deb.” 

Amy said with an excited squeal that made Dan laugh. As soon as the Jeep stopped, she hopped out and ran over to the pickup. 

“Dad! I didn’t know you were coming to lunch too!” Grabbing him in a bear hug. He wasn’t a tall man. Only about five foot eight and thin.  You could tell by looking though, he was hard and tough.  He had a thick head of white hair, that was perfectly groomed. It made him look older than his 50 years. 

“Daughter you get prettier every time I see you.” Frosty says as he holds Amy. 

Dan watches. Then a woman’s voice startles him.

“Danny, I’m Grandma Deb.”

Dan gives Deb a big hug. “Well it’s obvious where Amy got her good looks!” Looking at Deb, was almost like looking at Amy, only 38 years older. She was fighting Father Time and winning. Amy was proud of her for getting into the gym and getting in shape. She had fallen in love with CrossFit and it showed. 

“There’s the silver tongue Amy warned me about!” Deb says with a laugh. They stand there arm in arm, watching Frosty and Amy reconnecting. “Good drive, Danny?”

“Yes it was. Amy has finally learned that best music comes from the 70’s and early 80’s so we didn’t have to fight over the radio.”

“Lynyrd Skynyrd or the Beatles, Danny?”

Skynyrd. Seals and Croft or Simon and Garfunkel?”

“Summer moon makes me feel fine!” They both laughed. 

Amy and Frosty walk over. 

“Dan, this is my Dad, Frosty.  Frosty this is Dan.” Amy says, hoping they both behave themselves. They shake hands. 

“I’ve heard a lot of stories about you Frosty.” Dan says with a smile. 

“All of them good I hope!”

“Well, none of them were boring!” Dan replied. “Why don’t you ladies go get us a booth. Frosty and I will be in shortly.” 

Amy shoots Dan a dirty look. Which he ignores. Deb gives her son Frosty a dirty look also. It too gets ignored. The two women walk into the cafe. 

“I appreciate the call last week Dan.” Frosty says as he walks back to his pickup and pulls out a small package and hands it to Dan. “You were right, this was not the time nor the place for our first conversation.”

“Frosty, we are both to old to play games. We good?”

“That’s no shit!  Yeah we’re good. I don’t completely get it but that’s my problem.”

“Amy, means the world to the both of us, and at least I’m not that asshole Jerry!”

Both laugh. “You hold yourself to very high standards.” Frosty says, his voice full of sarcasm. 

“So one question. Where did she get her temper from?”

“From Deb. That woman could chew out a priest till he would apologize for being catholic.”

“Yep. I saw her bring one of my managers to tears for a screw up.” Dan puts the package in his suitcase. Both men walk into the cafe laughing.  That worried both Deb and Amy. 

Lunch was awash with stories and laughter.  Tales of Amy in her youth, had tears streaming down Dan’s face. 

Finally, the curiosity got the better of Deb. “So how did this relationship start? I’m not judging, I think you two are made for each other.”

Amy blushed and was tongue tied. So Dan fielded the question.  

“She fell for the old, ‘Do you want to come see the baby animals at farm. I’ll make burgers and brownie sundaes.’ Trick.”

“Women still fall for that stuff?” Deb asked. 

“Grandma are you saying you fell for that back in the day?” Amy says in shock. 

“Only two or three times.”Deb says with a smile. Amy is shocked into silence. Frosty is choking back his laughter. 

“Well it worked on this 30 year old blonde beauty. That’s all I care.” Dan said with a smile.  All of a sudden it dawned on Amy she was the butt of Deb’s joke.  

“What can I say, I like helping the elderly!” Amy said as she grabbed Dan’s hand under the table. Everyone laughed out loud. 

They finish lunch, then make plans to sit together at the wedding on Saturday.  

XOXOXOXO 

It was a little after 6:00 when Steve and Julie along with Todd and Russ join Dan and Amy at the steak house. 

Steve was a big powerfully built man just like his father. He had a head of dark curly hair. Clean shaven and bright eyes. 

Julie was a true beauty. She was actually a couple inches taller than Steve. She had been a college volleyball player. After two kids, she had regained her athletic body. Her long legs stretched forever from under her cute little summer skirt. The long black hair framed her beautiful green eyes and delicate features. She was just a couple years older than Amy and had a family.  Amy was a little envious of that fact. 

The boys were seven and five. Were typical boys, they were not shy and had lots of questions for Amy over the course of the evening. 

They were soon seated at the table and the questions for Amy flowed, from the boys. 

“You get to go swimming with us, when we get back home.” Russ announced. 

Todd  was annoyed. “You are supposed to ask her if she brought a swimsuit and ask if she wants to go swimming with us.”

“Your Grandpa and I brought our swimsuits. The last last one in the pool is a rotten egg!” Amy says.  Actually looking forward to it. 

“What’s your favorite dinosaur?” Russ asked Amy. 

“Trisaritops.  What’s yours?”

“Brontosaurus.”

“So are you Grandpa’s girlfriend?” Todd asks. 

“Yes, I am.”

“Do you guy’s go on dates.”

“Yes we do. We go to baseball games or get dressed up and go out for supper sometimes.”

“So do you guy’s hug and kiss like Mom and Dad?” Todd asks, as a horrified look crosses Julie’s face.

“Yes we do.”

“That’s gross.”

“I’ll remind you of that someday Todd.” Amy says with a knowing smile.

“So are you my grandma?” Russ asks. At this point Julie is looking for a hole to crawl into. Steve and Dan are amused at the conversation, Julie’s reaction has them choking back the laughter.  

Julie mouths, “DO SOMETHING.” At Steve. Who’s face is beet red from trying not to laugh.  

“Well no. But Conner and Katie call me Grandma Amy anyway.  I won’t be your grandma till I marry your Grandpa.”

“Grandpa!” Russ announces. “You need to marry Grandma Amy, she’s pretty, likes dinosaurs and likes going on dates with you.”

Amy can’t help herself. “Yeah Grandpa!” Even Julie is stifling her laughter at this point. 

Dan’s eyes sparkle. “You make some very good points Russ.”

Julie is relieved when the food starts to arrive and the boys turn their attention to the chicken strips. The rest of the meal is adult conversation with occasional questions from the boys.  Amy realized she needed to brush up on Starwars and Bluey.

The boys escorted Amy back to the Jeep, hand in hand. Telling stories and excited she was going to stay at their house. Dan gets into the Jeep. 

“Well it’s rather obvious you cast a wicked spell over the men in this family.” The smirk she loves plastered on Dan’s face. 

“They are just as charming and almost as handsome as their grandfather!”

“You my dear are one sexy grandma.”

“You better cool your jets Daddy, we probably are not going to get much alone time this weekend!”

XOXOXOXO 

They make the 40 minute drive back to Steve and Julie’s house. They get everything unloaded and the boys are waiting patiently in the pool. Dan hurries up and joins them. 

Amy puts on a set of white boy short bottoms and floral print-bra that  will allow for plenty of horse play  and no danger of exposing anything. She looks in the mirror. 

“Damn this is sexy. It makes my boobs and ass look great.” As she looks in the mirror her kitty starts to tingle. “What the hell, might be the only chance I get.”

She pinches her nipples. It feels so good. Then slides her hand on the outside of the boy shorts and starts to rub her kitty. She thinks ‘what the fuck!’ Amy strips naked and retrieves a butt plug from the suitcase.  She lubes it with spit then slowly pushed it into her ass. The stretch felt wonderful. Her heart began to pound as she played with her clit. Her other hand manipulating the plug.  Her breathing started getting ragged as she rapidly rubbed her kitty.  Two fingers penetrated her folds and a little orgasm made her shudder. She quickly dresses and heads to the pool. 

When she steps out Julie is sitting in a lounge chair and the men are splashing in the pool.  Dan sees her coming out and lets out a cat call whistle. Amy blushes and sits next to Julie.  

“Thank you for wearing something appropriate around the boys.” Julie says with a smile. “But damn you look hot.”

“Not as hot as their mom!” 

Julie was wearing a black sleek one piece  that although covering everything, showed off her figure. 

“I have one you can put on later that isn’t appropriate for young eyes for after the boys go to bed.  Thank you for being so patient with them at supper.  They were really looking forward to meeting you and seeing Dad.”

“They were perfect little gentleman.  I had fun.”

“Hopefully there Dad and Grandfather aren’t so gentlemanly later.” Julie says with a smile and a wink. With that Amy joins the boys in the pool.  

Dan swims past and whispers in her ear.  “Thanks to you, I can’t get out of the pool. You look to cute for your own good.”

Amy smiles, splashes him and heads to the boys, to play with them.  

9:00 rolls around and the boys hop out of the pool to go get showered up and to bed. Julie leading the way.  

Steve jumps out of the pool. “Who is up for a margarita?”

“Could you make mine a virgin please.” Amy asks.

“Not a problem. That’s what Julie likes too!” Amy thought she caught a wink from Steve.  

Soon the three of them are sitting around visiting.  

“So Steve you’re a Veterinarian. What animals do you work on?”

“Actually I don’t work on animals directly anymore. I do consulting work.  I’m having to spend more time than I like on the road visiting clients.  So Julie and I are talking about moving back around home.  A couple of my clients are close, we miss the family and with me being gone, there would be help for Julie in an emergency.”

Dan smiles at the thought. “There is a job in the company for Julie whenever she wants it.”

Julie calls from the house. 

“Amy can you come help me for a second.”

Amy walks into the house. 

“Alright the boys are asleep.  Time to torment our men.” She leads Amy to the bedroom. On the bed are 6 tiny bikinis, that don’t leave anything to the imagination. “Take whichever one you want. Unless you have one of your own.”

“All I brought was this one. Dan will love it. Are you sure it’s alright wearing one of these in front of your husband?”

Julie smiles, “He is 100% mine! A view of you in one of these will make for a lot of fun for me later.”

They both laugh knowingly.  “Also please wear clothes to bed. The boys have no understanding of privacy and might come in and wake you up in the morning!”

They strip out of their swim suits and pick out new ones. 

“Well aren’t you sexy with those piercings!” Julie exclaimed.  

Amy looked at Julie. She had a landing strip that was neatly trimmed and a volleyball tattoo just above her kitty and towards her left hip.  Her breasts we’re small but perky. She had a back tattoo that ran the length of her spine. 

“I have to to compete with those legs!” 

Amy picks out a tiny tear drop bottom thong, with a bandeau top. She turns around and Julie sees the plug, as she slips on the thong.  

“Well I didn’t expect that!” They finish putting on the bikinis. Julie chose a yellow one, that wasn’t muck more than 3 tiny triangles and string.

“Julie, Steve is going to come unglued when he sees you! That is sexy!”

Julie hugs Amy. “The guys are going to be wondering where we are. It didn’t take long to figure out why Dan loves you. Your beautiful, great with the boys, funny and sexy as hell. I hope we can become friends.”

Amy smiles. “I hope so too.” Together they head out to the pool.

Dan is facing the door when they walk out, holding hands. He stops mid sentence and just stares. Steve spins around and a big smile spreads across his face. There wasn’t enough material between the two bikinis to make a wash cloth. Each of the ladies take a seat next to their partner.  

“Where did this bikini come from?” Dan asks, unable to take his eyes off Amy. His cock already hard as a steel rod. 

Amy sips her margarita. “This old thing? It’s from Julie’s private collection. If you don’t like it, I can take it off.”

“No! I mean you look fantastic in it.” Dan knows he is being teased and doesn’t care. 

“I think it’s time to take a little swim.”  So Amy jumps into the pool, then turns around, just in time to see Steve and Julie head into the house. She reaches behind her back to release the bandeau top and tosses it at Dan. Instantly he is in the pool chasing after her.  She doesn’t even try to escape, nor does she want to.  She jumps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist.  

Dan instantly starts sucking on her nipples. They are almost painful as hard as they are. Carrying her to the edge of the pool, he sets her down. With sheer abandon he pulls off the thong and begins to devour her kitty. There was no playing at this point.  Each lick and kiss was filled with desire.  Removing the plug with his teeth, there was unobstructed access to both holes.  

Dan feasted like it was Thanksgiving.  Licking from her starfish to kitty. Each time his tongue penetrated her second hole, the moans got louder. The orgasm was building quickly and all it took to push her over the edge was one nibble in her clit.  

“Oh! Fuck me Daddy!” As she road the wave of the orgasmic pleasure.  

Almost instantly Dan was positioning his cock in front of Amy’s mouth, ready for her to work her magic.  Instead she sucked both testicles into her mouth and gently pulled. The cuss words began to flow.  The precum dripped onto her face. Slowly sliding two fingers into his back door.  Dan’s knees buckled.

“You are my butt slut.” Amy teases. 

“Oh shit! Stop! I need to be inside you.”

Amy releases Dan. He leads her to one of the loungers and lays on his back.  

“I want to watch you ride me in the moonlight, Baby Girl!”

Slowly she positions herself above his shaft and lowers herself down slowly. Gasping at how good the penetration feels. 

Amy riding, was one of his favorite positions. He lived to watch her breasts bounce. It didn’t take long for her to feel another orgasm building.  She kept bouncing, soon he was thrusting up to meet her.

Suddenly Dan pulled her down tight and released ropes into her. That set off Amy. Slowly she collapsed forward onto Dan’s chest completely spent. 

Finally Dan mutters. “Damn I need to get that pool built.”

I work in IT, and when not working, I contribute to FOSS, read books, watch movies, and sometimes draw sketches. I also love to cook for others, but that rarely happens. In terms of physical appearance, I'm 1.69m short, ~75kg light, and average looking.

I also like to travel, but more than that I like being at the airports, surrounded by so many languages, and cultures.

I maybe on neurodivergent spectrum (took some online test), and also have loner tendencies. So, I don't have many friends, and would prefer to be happy with just person.

Despite my age, I've only started growing not too long ago, so I often find it hard to relate with folks my age. I am usually a shy person, but I'm trying hard to get out of my comfort zone. As I learnt the hard way (aka *no real matches way*), dating apps are not my thing, as my photos are merely one or two words, than the thousand worthy others' pictures, and don't think anyone reads autobiographies. ;)

I'm also passionate about digital privacy, and so I never used (and prefer not to be on) any social networks, except Reddit, and Orkut (æons ago). I am also **vegan**, **childless childfree**, a **teetotaler** (abstaining from alcohol), **non-smoker**, and coffee drinker.

It's not that I seek someone to fill the time with, instead I seek someone to share the time with. I want to make the time I've left worth. I want to do things keeping someone in mind, like a muse whom I can amuse. I hope to support someone, and feel supported. I seek a **companion**, if you wish to call it.

Thank you for your time.

There was a sign by it that said it was called Lumberchné. Other than the crust, the bread was just normal yeasty bread, but with chocolate chips. As a commentator observing myself while in my dream, which I usually do while I’m dreaming, I brainstormed ways to make this food actually good. I decided that it would be good if you rolled up the dough into a spiral like a roll cake before baking it, so I guess that can be Lumberchné II . I don’t know if you’d flatten that roll into a long thin slab like a traditional Lumberchné, or if you’d go the regular bread route and just bake it in a loaf pan. I woke up before I decided about that. Also it would be good if you put cinnamon sugar between the layers, but I didn’t realize that until after I woke up so that doesn’t count.

Also, as I was failing to wake up this morning, l saw a short scene of Tom Hanks, putting a pre tied cherry stem in his mouth and removing an unchewed stick of gum. This isn’t a food but I just think the idea of reverse cherry stem tricks is really powerful and more people need to know about it.",9,1764115039.0,somnigastronomy,0,1.0,False

We set the one on the coffee pot. Usually we set it a couple minutes fast, but this time we set it right for the actual time. 

After a few days, I noticed that clock was a minute slow (compared to the time on my phone). Okay fine, no problem. It was probably 10:14:36 or something when I set it. Makes sense for it to be some seconds off. 

A few days later still, it’s suddenly two minutes slow. This morning, it was 3 minutes slow. 


I have felt the difference in time since 2020. But I wasn’t sold on it being anything other than me working so much that I lose all free time and the days fly by. 

Now, however…after comparing the time on a stand alone device (not a “smart” appliance) versus the time on my phone (easily manipulatable by some unseen force)… idunno… I’ve really been thinking about it a lot lately. ",12,1764115010.0,conspiracy,16,0.75,False

• We’re pretty tolerant of traffic and long commutes. 

• We’re in our early thirties. No kids, no dogs, but interested in getting both in the next few years. 

• It would be cool to be able to walk to a few bars and coffee shops, or at least be near enough to public transit that we wouldn’t have to hop in the car and drive somewhere every time we want to go to a more hip, walkable part of town. 

• What we would love more than anything is to be in a neighborhood where we can step out the door and have a safe, relatively scenic place to walk and run. Having a park nearby would be a dream come true. We currently live in a place that is so pedestrian-unfriendly that we have to drive to do literally anything, so the bar is in hell. 

We’re really looking forward to getting to know this beautiful region!! TYIA for the help :)

I am on 30mg of Vyvanse that i take on and off whenever I have days where I need to absolutely focus. Ideally, I dont want to be on this drug forever because Ive had lapses in insurance, and the inconsistency in that is what led me to not be reliant on the drug, which is ultimately good I suppose.

When Im dysregulated, I find myself horribly unmotivated; I put off important projects, dishes pile up and get filthy, the house is a mess and I barely leave the couch.

I have two creative gigs where I really want to prioritize regulating my dopamine and/or serotonin levels without prescription drugs.

My game plan is to find a supplement stack that really keeps me at a good baseline. Im not expecting magic here or a cure all, Im just looking to focus on staying even keeled and support a healthy regulation with dopamine (and/or serotonin)

Some things that are in my stack so far:  
\- Caffeine (in the form of one cup of coffee a day)  
\- Omega 3  
\- Vit D3+k2  
\- Zinc + Copper  
\- Vitamin C  
\- Florastor  
\- 50 billion probiotic  
\- Mary's liquid hair growth vitamins (has a ton of the methylated Vit B's)

Inconsistently use but whenever I remember:  
\- magnesium glycinate  
\- beef liver  
\- Liquid iron

What did not work for me:  
\- melatonin -- causes night terrors  
\- L arginine -- no go due to cold sores  
\- Ashwaganda (ksm66) didnt really do anything for me  
\- L theanine -- it caused headaches, irritability and anhedonia  
\- I have NAC but im worried to try it bc it can mess with stomach acid

For $1,000,000, 80% of people in your town suddenly know who you are, and your reputation as a violent, unpredictable felon. If you move to a new town, the new town suddenly knows. But if you go somewhere else temporarily, say to a different state on vacation, no one there will know. You face no actual legal repercussions or restrictions on life, so you could vote and own firearms without getting in trouble, etc, but many people in your town otherwise think you're a violent and deranged felon. 

For $2,000,000, 80% of the people in your county believe you are an animal abuser and know who you are. Similar rules to before, but your reputation precedes you. Go to get a coffee? The barista likely thinks you're an animal abuser. Eat at the restaurant? The server and cook know who they're making food for. Pulled over by a K-9 unit cop? Expect to be treated poorly.

For $5,000,000, 75% of the people in your major metropolitan area believe you are a non-violent sex offender. Again, no actual legal repercussions, but your face was all over the news and just about every mom with kids you walk past is creeped out, most women want nothing to do with you (or men, whatever). Anywhere you go around kids is likely to be uncomfortable, and vigilantes may or may not target you in public or at home.

For $10,000,000, 60% of your state believes you are a violent sex offender with highly publicized crimes against minors. Not much more needs to be said. Again, no actual repercussions legally, but everyone ***knows*** what you did. Quite likely to be targeted for harassment everywhere you go. Disguises don't work.

For $25,000,000, 60% of your entire country and the whole western world (thanks to news media) believes you are a pedophile, and an unapologetic racist (think 45/47th president level / Tucker Carlson / Charlie Kirk level of public disgust). They may not say it to your face due to your level of fame, but everywhere you go in the Americas, Europe, and the Pacific, people actively know you and your sins, and manifest hatred towards you fueled by a constant presence in the media, against your will.

Again, terms are for life. No relaxation over the course of many years, the vitriol from the public will remain. There is a small chance you can find and convince people of your true nature, but odds are almost everyone will just hate you or be entirely indifferent.

There is , however, one thing that brings this down......bond is clearly lacking morning coffee. He's so nasty in this film. It's funny most of the time..... except for the scene were he interrogates andrea anders. Can't lie , I hated this scene upon first viewing, and still hate it now. Bond is brutally nasty just because he can. It's not a good sign if even the main actor hates it.

In summary, Roger moore's era is absolutely fantastic. Hopefully TSWLM meets expectations.....

Edward stepped in, preceded by another man in a dark suit. Anthony recognized him from the hangar.

“You said you had something you needed to show me?” Edward asked.

The artist nodded and opened to the new drawing, turning it toward the older man.

“I don't think we stopped it.” he said plainly, his voice low, cold and deadpan.

Ed let out an exasperated breath. He took his time, examining each detail of the image that the younger male had drawn while in the trance state.

“When did this happen?” he asked.

Anthony closed the cover of the book as the waitress approached, and didn't answer the question until all three of them had ordered coffee, and sent her on her way.

“About an hour ago.” Anthony replied.

Edward sighed. He had wanted to give everyone time to return home and relax, thinking that by stopping the two demons, they had closed their very first case, but that didn't seem to hold true.

“Have you called the others yet?” Ed asked with another low breath.

Anthony shook his head.

“Go try to get some sleep, I have to figure out what we missed.” the man with the cane ordered after a moment, dropping money on the table, before standing, Andy following him back through the door and into the street.

Anthony hung around long enough to drink his own cup of caffeinated water. He dialed the same cab company he had used before, and on the way back to the hotel, he called Shayla, but that went straight to her voicemail. Once back at the building, he made for the elevator, stopping at the other psychic's room, knocking hard on the door. The sound startled her awake, and then came the disorientation. She hadn't had enough time to focus on building her walls.

Foreign thoughts and emotions flooded her mind, overwhelming for what seemed like forever. Panic, excitement, rage, lust. Everything. All at once. She focused, anchored herself. The pounding again.

'Come on...' Anthony's voice in her head, the panic accompanying it like a shot of adrenaline.

“One minute.” she called, starting to close herself off again.

She stood up and walked to the door to let Anthony in. The artist's face was grim and a little bit pale. He didn't say anything at first, simply opening the book to the image he had drawn a few hours earlier. The woman's eyes darted from one twisted, inhuman visage to another, to the flames and broken shapes of vehicles and buildings.

“Have you told Edward?” she breathed.

“He was the first person I called.” Anthony assured.

“We need to show the others.” she proclaimed, picking up the sketchbook and moving toward the door.

In The Special Containment Unit:

Falielle was getting stronger again, his control of the meat suit he was wearing coming back rather quickly. The problem now was that the walls and floor of the concrete room were layered in carved sigils that kept him contained. Not only stuck in the room, but within the body he had stolen. No escape. He knew that the female was in a similar situation if they went to all this trouble. The sound of a distant door opening could be heard and then two sets of footsteps approaching. The door to his cell rolled wide, revealing the man from the hangar, leaning on the cane.

He was shackled wordlessly and herded into what looked like an interrogation room, complete with one way mirror. Behind that was a digital camcorder which Andy started before walking back around to join the others in the interrogation room.

“How can I help you?” the demon sneered.

“Why were you going to Crater Lake?” Edward answered with a question of his own.

“Vacation.” Falielle laughed.

His mouth was still open when the agent splashed holy water directly into it, along with his face. It felt as if there were acid searing through his flesh. Wiping at it only spread the pain to his hands. The pain faded after a moment.

“Why were you going to Crater Lake?” Ed reiterated.

“To see your mother.” the demon taunted.

More screams. He thrashed in the shackles, tried to evacuate the body, but an invisible pressure kept him contained. Was the whole building warded? He hoped not. His mind flickered to his companion. His lover and second in command. He wondered if she was being questioned as well. He didn't have long before a new kind of pain jolted through him. He looked down to see a crucifix being pressed to the bare flesh of his forearm. It felt less like fire and more like electricity flowing through him until the man pulled it away.

“I am going to ask again, and if you don't tell me, you're going back to the box.” the elder agent in the room said, then added, “Why were you going to Crater Lake?”

“You think I can tell you that? You might hurt me, even banish me but it pales compared to my fate if I open my mouth.” Falielle spat.

Edward sighed and shook his head.

“Get him back to his cell. We'll try again after a few hours.” he told Andy.

The younger agent hauled the demon up by his bicep and marched him out into the hall and back to the room he had awakened in. Then, he was alone again. Feeling just a little bit of desperation. He couldn't hold up to the torture, especially if they truly knew how to hurt those of his kind, which after that brief interrogation, he believed they did. He knew it wouldn't work but tried to escape the meat he was occupying.

Down the hall, his partner was trying the same thing, to little success. Both exhausted themselves.

At The Field Office:

Adeline sat on the small cot in the basement. The other angel lay motionless on his own bed. Her eyes moved to the exit and she stood as quietly as she could, feet barely whispering over the tile floor as she made her way out into the hall, and from there to the stairwell that would allow her roof access once more. The chill of the air barely registered to her, even though she wore nothing beyond the borrowed shirt and sweatpants that had been offered to her. She didn't take flight, instead walking to the edge, placing her hands on the waist high barrier.

She could still feel the darkness, a thousand miles away. That meant that Michael could as well, but had said nothing about it, either to her or the humans that had been assisting them. Her eyes moved to the stars, staring up at the brilliant points of light that shown through the abyss above. Unlike the others who might be peering up into the night sky, she knew what lay beyond. Just outside of this tiny swirl of gas and matter that they called a universe. For a moment, she felt the urge to return home, to try again to cut through the Gordian Knot that bound the hands of her brothers and sisters.

The problem was, none of them would listen to her. They would listen to Michael, but he seemed to have his own ideas on how to manage the situation. This was when faith should have made it easier for her to trust him, but it was taking her actual effort to do so. Doubt had taken root in her heart, a gnawing, uneasy feeling. Along with that came paranoia. Did the elder angel have his own agenda? Was there a reason he had neglected to ensure the door was closed?

Those questions, and a hundred more ran through her mind like the world's longest run on sentence. She let out a long sigh and turned to walk back inside, pausing when the door opened. The man who stepped through was not the blonde that she had been expecting, but one of the humans. Andy smiled and gave her a polite nod as he reached into the inside pocket of the tailored suit jacket, extracting a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. He sparked up on of the sticks of tobacco and chemicals, leaning on the railing next to her, but not speaking.

“Is everything okay?” she said after a few moments, the question feeling heavy and forced in the chill, early morning air.

The agent took a long drag, and breathed out the carcinogenic cloud of smoke. It was almost a sigh.

“I'm really not sure. It looks like we might have to turn around and head back West.” he replied, voice low and smooth.

She sighed as well. She had suspected that something was going on due to the elevated activity level in the building, the cosmic creature much more in tune to the energy that resulted from heightened stress and even excitement. She nodded.

“That might be for the best. I feel something's not right.” she confessed, an invisible weight lifting from the angel's shoulders.

“Yeah. Me too.” the human replied, though he didn't mention the drawing.

He stubbed out the cigarette and turned toward the door without saying anything else, in fact. He closed it behind him, and descended the stairs back into the building, moving aside when he saw the blonde man coming in the opposite direction. He nodded as they passed one another, but the angel ignored him. For a moment he paused and considered reversing and trying to eavesdrop on the conversation. The chances of being discovered were too high so he went back to the room where his belongings were being stored.

He was starting to pack a bag when the phone on the small table began to ring.

Somewhere In Oregon:

The boy's body had grown hungry. One disadvantage of a living host, and why Falielle, and most other demons chose to inhabit the recently deceased. He hadn't had the privilege of having contact with devoted humans however, and he was no loyalist to either side of the festering conflict in what the humans called Hell. He was simply an opportunist, a lower level demon who was subservient to those of the ilk of the ones who had left the door open behind them. He simply wanted out. Away from it all.

Being what he was, possessing the boy was taxing. Keeping him suppressed took more energy than the beast had anticipated. It was wearing him thin, making it harder for him to remain anchored. It considered stabbing the body fatally in order to end the struggle, but truth be told, that was a last resort. The plan was to release the child when he found a more suitable host. Preferably an adult body. This arrangement had been pure survival and opportunity. How could he pass that up? A chilling smile crossed his face as he spotted a new opportunity.

He had been looking for a place to hide as the sun rose, taking refuge at a deserted service station, using his enhanced strength to simply snap the lock on the back door as he turned the knob. The place was dusty, and moldy, but he could hide here, he decided. Another biological necessity reared its ugly head. The need for sleep. He found a box that contained old beach blankets. There must have still been stock around when the place shut down. He used a few of those as a sort of pillow and another to cover his body, sleeping on the floor, in the far corner of the room.

His eyes closed, and for the first time in over three hundred years, the demon in the boy's body had a dream. It wasn't his own however, all of the scenery and insinuations of people formed from the mind of the child. It was still enough to unsettle the unholy thing and in that moment, the hooks he had in the boy weakened. Suddenly, he was cast out, un-tethered, and angry. He considered re-entering the child, but instead, decided to move on in his spectral form, at least until he found another host. Even in that ghostly state, it took him almost a day to reach a small town called La Pine.

It was a secluded town that mostly seemed occupied by farmers. Most of those would be too strong willed for him, but he sensed something here. A soul suffering, crying out for help. It was like a broadcast signal. Easy to pick up with the right tuning, but harder to pin down the source. He found a shadowy place in the back of a building to settle, his faint figure practically disappearing into the gloom. When the sun set again, he began his search for the one who was putting off the delicious pain that he couldn't ignore.

He found the building it was emanating from. Just past the town, a singular building sat on a bluff. There were roads to and from it, but after dark, it was sparsely populated. That made it easy for the demon to simply sprint through the gloom, up the hill, a flash of movement in the shadows before it hesitated. The radio station was surrounded by lights. It may not have been the most powerful demon ever created, but it was fully capable of walking through that. The problem was, it would be mostly visible.

A humanoid shape with the legs of a goat, barely there, but absolutely real, flashed across the single monitor as the camera picked up its movement near the door. The lone security guard didn't notice it, and even if he had, would have dismissed it as a glitch. In the studio, Aaron Darby bobbed his leg in time with the song coming through the headphone over his right ear, awaiting his cue.

As soon as the On Air light came on, a bloodcurdling scream was broadcast over the airwaves.

Edward was tired. He was irritable, and the rage had brought on one of his headaches. He swallowed a pair of the pain pills he kept in his pocket and sighed. He might have to let the blonde angel lead the charge on the Portland return, as he had a feeling that he would be needed elsewhere. Already there were things happening in Nevada.

It seemed as if the darkness was spreading east like an infection, and the only directive he was being given was to stop it. When he asked for resources, however, there was foot-dragging and excuses from those involved. The pounding in his head got worse.

Hello, I’m 23F and just moved to the Lacey area though I’ve been in Washington my entire life. My New Years Resolution this year will be to try as many new trails/walks as I can to get out and explore more. 

Currently not looking for any men- nothing personal, I’m just more comfortable around women (especially to be potentially going out into the woods with).

I have two dogs, one small and one large. Both are super people friendly and dog tolerant. They aren’t the types to play with other dogs but do great just walking alongside or interacting in general. If you have a dog then I ask that they are the same and/or will be accepting of a dog that doesn’t want to jump around and play with each other. 

I’m extremely 420 friendly and would love if you were too but definitely not a requirement. Also would love to find someone open to day/weekend trips to explore. I’m very laid back and easy going, try to leave as much stress and drama out of my life as I can. 

I work two jobs so my life and schedule can be a bit chaotic to work around. Usually weekend mornings and rotating week day evenings are my free times. 

Please let me know if you’d be interested and we can schedule a day to grab a coffee and a little walk! 

Just want to confirm that this is completely platonic, I’m not looking for any sort or relationship or hookups. ",10,1764113991.0,olympia,2,0.92,False

1p6s3r8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6s3r8,"Just shipped my own French-learning macOS companion (built as a learner, for learners) – would love feedback","Hey All,  
  
I’m learning French and got tired of the usual pattern: cute streak apps, locked content, everything phoning home to some server. So I built **Apprendre**, a French “language workbench” that just lives on your Mac, works offline and private.

**What it is (right now)**

* You paste/type any French text and get: instant English translation, sentence audio, and word‑by‑word breakdown along with phonetic cues in one place.
* You can bookmark your fav or complex words and jump back into the exact sentence later, so reviews always have context instead of random isolated vocab. You can build vocabs for future revisions
* You can ask things like “How do I order coffee?” and the local LLM builds a small, focused lesson with phrases you can actually use.​

**Under the hood / why it’s different**

* 100% on‑device: apart from the initial model download, all translation, pronunciation, and lesson planning runs locally. No tracking, no selling data, no account.
* Uses macOS system TTS, so you get native‑quality voices and can flip between speakers in settings instead of being stuck with one robotic voice.
* One‑time “pay what you want” (minimum 5 USD) for lifetime access to Pro features and future versions; no subscriptions, no dark patterns.​ You can download for free if you want just this version.

**Where it’s going (roadmap in plain English)**

* Phase 1 (now): solid workbench for serious learners – local translation, clean UI, good audio, distraction‑free.
* Phase 2: proper curriculum with DELF‑style paths (A1–B2), reading/writing helpers, and lightweight progress tracking.
* Phase 3: on‑device speaking tutor with role‑plays, pronunciation scoring, and real‑time voice conversations.
* Phase 4: an adaptive tutor that actually remembers your weak spots and builds lessons around them instead of making you redo the same random exercises.​

**Why I’m posting here**  
  
I built *Apprendre* because I’m learning French myself and was annoyed enough to code my own tool instead of forcing Duolingo to be something it isn’t. If you’re a serious learner on macOS (DELF, immigration, work, long‑term move, etc.), I’d love your feedback on:

* What’s missing for it to become a daily driver for you?
* Anything confusing or over‑engineered in the current flow?
* Features you’d *actually* use during a 30‑minute focused session?

**Links:**

* Homepage + download: [apprendre.bytebanyan.com](http://apprendre.bytebanyan.com)
* Short walkthrough video: [apprendre.bytebanyan.com/#walkthrough​](http://apprendre.bytebanyan.com/#walkthrough​)

You can use it for free; if it clicks with you, throwing 5 bucks at it locks in lifetime updates and helps justify me sinking even more time into it.",3,1764113445.0,learningfrench,2,1.0,False

Today was one of those mysterious-but-funny school days where everyone suddenly becomes a detective…
because of D. B. Cooper.

Yesterday, I asked my genius sister Gillian about him after hearing something at school, and she gave me the whole breakdown like a real historian:

A man hijacked a plane in 1971

Got $200,000

Parachuted out of the plane in a storm

And then…
POOF.
Disappeared forever.


I couldn’t stop thinking about it.
How does someone jump out of a plane and just vanish?
Even Kira said, “That’s like… boss-level hide-and-seek!”

🏫 At School — Detective Squad Begins

Before class, I told Penny, Kira, and Winfrey what Gillian explained.
The moment I finished, Penny grabbed my shoulders dramatically.

“AMY. What if he escaped into another dimension?”

Winfrey gasped.
Kira said, “Or maybe he became a forest wizard.”

I said, “Guys… Gillian didn’t mention wizards.”

But they ignored me and started brainstorming theories like it was a group project:

Penny: “He disguised himself as a tree.”

Winfrey: “He lived with Bigfoot.”

Kira: “He jumped so hard he time-traveled.”


I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.
Even Monique and Siu Ling from the other class joined us and said:

“Maybe he opened a café somewhere… The Cooper Coffee House.”
Carmen added, “I’d drink there.”

📚 History Class — Unplanned Comedy Hour

During free reading time, Penny asked the teacher if she’d heard of D. B. Cooper.
Miss Clarice said yes — in a very serious tone.

But then she tried to draw a map of where he jumped…
and accidentally drew the Pacific Northwest as a potato shape.
The whole class started giggling.

Miss Clarice said, “Okay, yes, it’s not perfect—DON’T LAUGH.”
We tried not to…
We FAILED.

Even she started laughing after a minute.


---

🍱 Recess — The Legend Expands

While eating lunch, we took turns creating “The Fate of D. B. Cooper” stories:

Winfrey wrote a dramatic novel plot

Penny drew a cartoon of him riding a giant eagle

Kira made a theory that he lives in Sunnyville disguised as a grandpa


Then they turned to me and said,
“Amy, what’s YOUR theory?”

I swallowed my sandwich dramatically and said:

> “He landed… got hungry… and went to Coffee Day.”



Everyone burst out laughing so loud that Haruka, who was passing by the window, looked confused.

🏡 After School

When I told Gillian everything, she pressed her fingers to her forehead like she had a headache.

“I explain real history and you turn it into comedy hour?” she said.
I told her, “It was educational comedy!”
She sighed. “With you guys, everything becomes a meme.”

But she was smiling.
I knew she secretly liked our theories — even the wizard one.


---

It’s funny…
Yesterday I didn’t even know who D. B. Cooper was.
Today, he became the star of our lunch break.

I love how my friends turn mysteries into fun.
History has never been this entertaining.

Love,

I need some advice on what to do going forward and I have to start with the beginning of my employment with... Starbucks. To start off, none of the stores in my district are union stores. From what I understand, none of them want to be. I started with Starbucks as a shift leader back in June. I was at a store with a newer manager who was extremely unprofessional and treated us extremely unfair. I was not the first person to raise concerns about this managers practices. She would call us crying and would guilt trip us into coming in and covering, she would threaten us when we were sick, and almost no new partner was trained properly. At the time I brought MY concerns to the DM I still had my old car which couldn't continue to take me to and from my store (it was a 20 minute drive) so I asked for an emergency transfer. About a week later, since I was making shift pay ($5 more an hour than barista pay).  I bought a new car. Then I was told id be transferring to a new store. My manager at that store is friends with the manager at my old store (which the old SM doesn't like me or anyone else who brought her to the DM). My new SM was extremely mean to me from the get go, before I had even transferred. Once I got to her store, I was on my first shift and 3 hours into it was informed our store would be closing due to the mass store closures. My SM guaranteed me that my position was safe and that I would not lose my job. Well, I did. So I was crying, super upset, I just made big life decisions based on the pay I was receiving as a shift. I was allowed to reapply, so I did. I applied for a store with great management. I was then told theres no shift supervisor positions open in the district anymore. So I hired on as a barista and was promised the next shift position. Well, about 2 weeks into my employment as a barista at this store, my SM quit. Guess who our new SM is? The SM from my 2nd store who was mean to me due to her friendship with the first SM. She is constantly degrading me, belittling me, all while trying to 1 up me for whatever reason with EVERYTHING I do. Every single day she says she thinks it's good im a barista now because now I ""will know what it feels like to be a barista"". Ive been in coffee for 5 years. Just not at Starbucks. I have been a shift lead for 4 out of 5 of those years. Its extremely infuriating, but I play nice and I follow every Starbucks standard and am super quick and very communicative (which most partners at my store are not even fully trained and they dont follow standards or communicate well). She then told me that she is not guaranteeing me a shift position. She nit picks me all the time, shes only nice to me when she wants something from me. The other day she voiced to me that she doesn't like talking to people when shes tired, and I laughed and said ""yeah me either I jumble up my words sometimes and it comes out wrong when im tired"". The next day she told me she was ""scared to make me a shift because I told her the day before that I can't communicate with people in the morning"" and I responded with ""that's not what I said, please dont take it out of context"" because she KNOWS that's not what I meant. I didn't even imply that. She also is fully aware that my life outside of work is falling apart due to making barista pay now instead and she has been scheduling me less than 30 hours a week despite saying she can schedule me 40. So recently, 3 stores in our district opened up shift positions. I applied for all 3. My store, and 2 others. I interviewed at one other and I told my ASM (who is also now leaving) but didn't tell my SM because she was on vacation. The interview went well and she told me that and my ASM also told me that. When my SM found out she freaked out and yelled at me because nobody is ""communicating with her"" and frantically continued to say ""I need to call [other SM] before she makes a decision"" The other SM ended up calling me and saying ""After speaking to [My SM] I nolonger think it's beneficial to move forward with you with this shift supervisor position. It seems like maybe it's a good thing for you to be a barista"" which is extremely weird since the interview went well, and the 'good thing im a barista' is the same thing my SM has been telling me every single day. I then reached out to the OTHER store I applied at and asked if the position is still open and if so when can I interview, to which that SM replied that he was informed by MY SM that I interviewed with a different store and nolonger was interested in the position at his store. I believe that im being targeted and that I am a victim of workplace retaliation but im unsure. I have documentation of most conversations I've had with my SM and other SMs. I have others telling me it's workplace retaliation, since shes friends with my first SM. Im completely losing my mind at this point and I'm unsure what to do because im scared to report ANOTHER SM to my DM. What do you guys think??

1p6s0qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UmmProducts/comments/1p6s0qo/which_laptop_stand_types_are_best_for_portability/,Which laptop stand types are best for portability?,"When you're always on the move, finding the right laptop stand can make your work life so much easier. Whether you're a student bouncing between classes, a freelancer working from coffee shops, or someone who travels for business, you need something that won't weigh you down.

**Foldable Laptop Stands Win for Travel**

Foldable stands are usually the best choice when portability matters. They collapse flat and slip right into your backpack without taking up much space. Most weigh less than a pound, which means you barely notice them. The design is simple – just unfold, place your laptop on top, and you're ready to work with better posture anywhere.

**Adhesive Stands Are Ultra-Light**

These tiny stands stick directly to the bottom of your laptop. They're super light and always stay attached, so you can't forget them at home. While they don't lift your screen as high as other options, they still improve airflow and give you a slight angle for more comfortable typing. Perfect if you want something that literally adds zero bulk to your carrying setup.

**Adjustable Portable Stands Offer Flexibility**

Some portable laptop stands come with adjustable height settings while still being compact. They might be slightly heavier than basic foldable ones, but the extra features can be worth it. You get multiple angle options, which helps whether you're sitting at a low café table or standing at a hotel desk.

If you're ready to upgrade your mobile workspace, check out some quality options at [this collection of laptop stands](https://athomewave.com/laptop-stand). Finding the right portable stand means you'll actually use it instead of leaving it at home.

**Material Matters**

Aluminum stands are lightweight but strong. Plastic versions weigh even less but might not feel as sturdy. For everyday carrying, aluminum hits the sweet spot between durability and weight.

The best portable laptop stand is one you'll actually carry with you every day. Look for something under one pound, flat when folded, and stable enough to hold your device securely. Your neck and back will thank you for using proper ergonomics even when you're away from your main desk.

1p6rzf6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p6rzf6,Halp! Is there a way to see how bad my sanding snafu is before staining/finishing this coffee table (or should I forget about stain)?,"I apologize in advance for not having the vocabulary to explain things properly and for the \[I'm sure\] travesty of what I did to this coffee table! Noob doesn't even begin to describe me.

TL;DR: Is there an easily recoverable way to see how bad a stain job will be because of how I am sanding the wood? Or do I need to give up and paint it instead? Or some other finish I am not aware of? I was aiming to get it to a darker (not oak-like) warmer tone and keep that butcher block look.

* I have no idea what kind of wood it is nor what kind of stain/finish this piece had.
* I used a belt sander with 40-grit sanders AND went across the grain, diagonal, etc.
* For the past 4 hours and 4 belts, I've been sanding it along the grain with the sander and 80-grit. I ran out of 80 belts, but am almost not able to see the cross grain scratches anymore. 
* 80 is also what I used on everything else, like that other part pictured in the kitchen. It was enough.
* The plan is that once I cannot see the cross scratches, I will move to 120-grit on an orbital sander, do the pencil marking thing, go 1""/second with just the weight of the sander, and along the grain. Then apply pre-stain, then a stain, then some protective coating (thinking polyurethane.
* But I think I messed up/will mess up too much. Is there a technique, like applying something very lightly, to see how bad the surfaces are before I invest time and money on pre-stain, stain, and the poly? Or should I just start thinking about slapping on a few coats of paint? Or something else?

 Let's talk like man to man.

  
So, who spit in your coffee? Why are you destroying your game that started in 2015 as an ambitious project, which slowly turned into a cash grab? Even so, we endured because you always brought something nice to the table. Our relationship had its ups and downs, but in the end we always found a way to make it work.

  
Revan 

Malak 

Starkiller 

Bane

Dark Vision Rey 

GAC 

Relic levels

Multiple Legends 

Unique events. 

The list was long and good. But this time you crossed a line that should never be crossed. Basically you told all of us to F ourselves if we don't open our wallets and give every penny. I am not a shareholder or a corporate person, so I guess my brain cannot understand the long play here.

  
You are losing revenue so fast that even C3PO would be like, Nope, I'm out. not translating this sh\*t.

  
Your highest income was back in 2017 when Revan released with trailers. The Malak event was still one of the best things I played because it took patience and skill to beat. I remember playing it early in the morning before work, drinking my coffee, and finally winning. I shouted like a kid because I did it.

  
There was passion in those moments. Now there is nothing. It feels like a barren land. The game feels like Korriban without the cool parts, without the lore, like a dead planet. What happened? What changed?

You had a formula that made money, a lot of money, and you threw it out for ideas that nobody wanted. Now we are sitting here like it is the end of the Clone Wars, wondering what comes next. Is there even a next part? Will there be enough players and income to continue? Or is this a final push to grab as much money as possible before shutting down?

I want to make this clear. I love this game. I have never played anything for this long with this much time and effort. It honestly breaks my heart to see that it feels like you do not care anymore. Everything is about money now and it is exhausting. If you want the communitys money, then give the community something it actually wants.

Legend Revan, more KOTOR characters, more clones, your own original characters like the Rey you made, creative events, pod racing, collector mode. Anything that feels inspired. Nobody likes ships anyway.

This is your last chance to fix things or end it. Put it out of its misery. If you don’t care anymore, at least say it directly instead of hiding it behind confusing changes. I miss the old days when there was mutual respect between devs and players. I'm not even angry. Just sad and disappointed. I want things to turn around, but even hope is fading at this point. F the era system, F the relic delta, F the three month wait for every new character. Without a community there is no game, and the community is leaving fast. 

Fix the game or let it die.",13,1764112788.0,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,3,0.81,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Humorous Prediction: Boston Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons (Nov. 26, 2025)**  
*“The Celtics enter this matchup with the swagger of a team that’s 9-8 and somehow still relevant. The Pistons? They’re just here to remind everyone that undefeated records are fragile things, like a glass Celtics bench after a hard fall.”*

**Key Stats & Odds:**

* **Moneyline**: Detroit Pistons (-152) are favorites, while Boston Celtics (+240) are the underdogs. Implied probabilities? Pistons at 61.7%, Celtics at 29.9%. (Thanks, math!)
* **Spread**: Pistons -3.5 (-110) vs. Celtics +3.5 (-110). The line has wavered between 3.0 and 3.5 points across books, suggesting bookmakers are arguing激烈ly over coffee.
* **Total**: 228.5-230.5 points (Over/Under). The Over is priced between 1.87 and 1.95 (-205 to -210), implying a “moderate” chance of a fireworks show.

**Player Props to Watch:**

1. **Jaylen Brown (Celtics)**:
   * **First Basket**: +470. Last time he faced Detroit, he dropped 41 points. The Pistons’ defense is like a welcoming committee for high scorers (they allow 112.8 PPG).
   * **First Team Basket**: +175. If Brown opens the game with a bucket, consider it a Celtics victory deposit.
2. **Cade Cunningham (Pistons)**:
   * **First Basket**: +600. The rookie star is averaging 25 PPG on 49% FG. If he beats Brown one-on-one, the Celtics’ “rebuildin

The goal is to ship **13 projects** by **April 2026**, across games, fiction, digital theatre, and physical art.

Here’s the slate I’m working toward. I’m sharing it publicly so fellow creators can see the process (and maybe steal the structure if it helps).



# 🧵 1–2. Dungeon of Cats + Story of the Feldlings (TTRPGs)

Two small, tightly-designed systems releasing on **DriveThruRPG**.

* *Dungeon of Cats* → cozy-chaotic dungeon crawl with powers themed around cat logic.
* *Feldlings* → surreal woodland-fantasy micro-TTRPG (I’m also doing a behind-the-scenes zine for it).



# 📱 3. Top15 App (Website Release)

A collector-culture web app where players build and share their Top-15 lists (games, comics, films, books, etc.). Inspired by late-90s fan pages + modern social design.



# 📰 4–6. Three Zines

* **Zine 1** – *NerdCulture Coffee & Conversations* (interviews + essays).
* **Zine 3 – Giant Satanic Potato** – a reconstruction of a lost 1999 schlock short film.
* **Zine Zero** – *Making of the Feldlings TTRPG* (BTS dev diary, art, world notes).



# 📘 7. Novella #1 — Destined for Perfection

My first longform fiction release in this slate — cyber-spiritual weird lit with a Cronenberg/King/Coupland meets Greg Egan/Glen Duncan influence spectrum.



# 🎥 8. Machinima Season 1

Open-source digital theatre series built with retro/DIY tools. Art-house meets glitch-media. A proof-of-concept for future digital theatre and “living art world” projects.



# 🎮 9. T.A.N.K.S. (Digital Art Edition)

Not a game (yet) — a software-art reinterpretation of retro artillery games. Static worlds + concept pieces for a later playable remake.



# 📚 10. Short Story — Under the Surface

Sub-10K psychological weird fiction, planned for a magazine submission run after completion.



# 🎭 11. Theatre Script (NZ Release)

A 165-page two-part stage script, being trimmed and submitted to **Playmarket**, NZ’s national playwright agency.



# 🐉 12. Free Webcomic — Awkward Dragonspeaker

Weekly updates. Light-hearted fantasy slice-of-life, connected loosely to the wider world-building slate.



# ⚙️ 13. Kinetic Orb (Prop Art) + CC-BY Art Pack

* A physical sculpture: tin/aluminium shell, clockwork + LED core.
* A **33-page CC-BY art pack** releasing on Patreon for creators to use freely in their own projects.



# Why I’m Posting This

I’m documenting the entire build-up to April 2026 because:

* Posting in public keeps me accountable.
* I want to compare workflows with other solo creators.
* I’m always looking to meet others building weird transmedia worlds.
* If any of these ideas resonate with your own projects, I’d love to hear about it.

The morning light filtering through faded curtains.
The soft thump of little feet in the hallway.
Lily’s small voice, bright and warm: “Daddy, wake up…”

And then the sound that didn’t belong in any home—
a wet, tearing scream.

Michael threw himself out of bed. The hallway spun. His thoughts tangled. He reached the kitchen to find a scene so violently wrong that his mind refused to understand at first.

Lily lay crumpled on the tile, her hands twitching like she was still trying to grab the air.
Emily—his wife of twelve peaceful years—stood over her, shaking, clutching a kitchen knife slick with something dark.

For a moment, Emily’s eyes weren’t hers.
They were glassy, bottomless, like windows into a place that was hungry.
And then they were human again—stricken, broken—as she whispered:

“I… I didn’t want to…”

Michael remembered the phone slipping from his hand.
He remembered the sirens.
He remembered holding Lily’s small, cooling body against his chest until the paramedics tore her away.
He remembered Emily screaming as they took her, her voice shredded by terror.

And then—

Darkness swallowed the world.

⸻

THE SECOND ENDING

He woke to the same soft thump of feet.

Michael shot upright so fast he felt something snap in his neck.

Everything was wrong.

Lily peeked around the doorway, alive, smiling, holding her stuffed rabbit by one ear.

“Daddy? Mommy says breakfast is ready.”

And there it was—Emily’s gentle humming floating up the stairs. The same song she hummed the morning Lily died. His blood turned to ice.

He ran downstairs.
The kitchen was spotless.
No blood.
No brokenness.
No knife on the floor.

Emily turned toward him with a smile that made his stomach twist.

But her eyes—
even then—
held a flicker of something that did not belong.

Michael shadowed Lily the rest of the day. He didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. Didn’t let her out of his sight.

But he had to look away once.
Just once—
when his phone buzzed.
A reflex.
Half a second.

A dull thud upstairs.
A small gasp.

Michael ran until his lungs burned.
By the time he reached the room, it was too late—again.

Emily stood over Lily’s body, her hands trembling violently, the same broken whisper dripping from her lips:
“I don’t want to… I have to…”

And then—
again—
darkness.

⸻

THE LOOPS

Day after day, the world reset.

Thirty-seven times Michael tried to keep Lily home from school.
Forty-two times he fled the house with her.
Seventeen times he locked Emily in the basement.
Nine times he called the police before anything happened.
Three times he tried tying Emily down—each time she thrashed and sobbed so violently he thought she would snap her own bones to reach Lily.

And every time—

Every. Single. Time.

Lily died before midnight.

Sometimes by knife.
Sometimes by drowning.
Once Emily threw herself from the stairs with Lily in her arms, repeating, “It wants her, it wants her, it wants her.”

The worst part wasn’t the blood.
It wasn’t the screams.

It was Lily’s small, fading voice each time:

“Daddy… it hurts…”

Michael began dreading morning more than death itself.

⸻

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DECAY

Loop after loop, Michael’s mind unraveled.

He stopped eating.
Stopped sleeping.
His hands shook so violently he couldn’t open doors without fumbling.
He couldn’t look at Emily without wanting to scream—or wanting to beg her to come back to him.

He wondered if his brain was rotting inside his skull.

He wondered if he was dead.
If this was hell.
If he deserved it.

By loop eighty, he realized Emily remembered the loops too.
She didn’t say it outright.
But the look in her eyes—raw, torn, terrified—told him enough.

“Michael… please… I don’t… I don’t want to hurt her,” she whispered one morning, hands trembling violently around a coffee cup. “Something in this house… behind the walls… keeps telling me what to do.”

And that was when he heard it:

A whisper.

Soft at first, like wind through dry leaves.
Then clearer.
Hungrier.

A voice inside the walls, curling through the corners, shaping the shadows.

It wants her.
It wants her.
It wants her.

Michael smashed holes into the walls with his bare fists, screaming until blood smeared the plaster.

He found nothing inside.
Only darkness.
And the whispering growing louder—mocking him.

⸻

THE DAY THAT CHEWED HIM RAW

By loop 112, Michael could no longer look at Lily without crying.
She noticed.

“Daddy? Why are you sad?”

He had no answer.
How do you tell a child that she dies every day?
That you have watched her take her last breath over a hundred times?

That you always fail her?

By loop 136, Emily stopped fighting the influence.
She cried in corners.
Sang lullabies through trembling lips.
Apologized to Lily for things she hadn’t done yet—but would.

On loop 149, Michael held her as she broke down, her nails digging into his arms hard enough to draw blood.

“If you love her,” she whispered, “don’t let me touch her. Ever again.”

He wanted to save them both.
He couldn’t.

No matter how many times he tried, the loop twisted itself to guarantee tragedy.

He began to understand:

This wasn’t about Emily.
It wasn’t about Lily.

The loop wanted him.
His fear.
His grief.
His hope dying over and over again.

It fed on him.

Every scream.
Every failure.
Every tear.

⸻

THE LAST LOOP—OR SO HE HOPED

On the final loop—the one where Michael tried to break the cycle once and for all—he didn’t eat.
Didn’t speak.
Didn’t blink.

He took Lily into his arms and barricaded the bedroom.
He held Emily tightly, whispering apologies into her hair.
She sobbed until her voice broke.

The whisper in the walls rose to a deafening chorus.

Midnight approached.

Michael kissed Lily’s forehead.
He whispered the same thing she had whispered to him in a dozen dying moments:

“I’m so sorry.”

And then—

Darkness swallowed the world again.

⸻

THE AFTERMATH THAT WASN’T AN AFTERMATH

He woke.

The house was empty.

Too empty.

Lily’s room was stripped bare—no toys, no drawings, no pink blankets.
Emily’s closet was empty, the hangers swinging gently as if recently disturbed.

The entire house felt hollow, gutted, as if something had eaten everything inside it.

Michael stood in the center of the living room, trembling.

Then—

From the hallway came the soft patter of footsteps.

Too light to be an adult.
Too quick to be real.

A child’s giggle.

And then—

Daddy… you couldn’t save me.
So now you stay with me.
Forever.

Michael turned toward the whisper—

—and the day began again.

Only this time, he wasn’t running to save anyone.

He was the one being hunted.

1p6rnna,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/1p6rnna/whats_the_anthropological_explanation_for_humans/,What's the anthropological explanation for humans keeping pets?,"Humans spend billions of dollars every year feeding, housing and caring for animals that provide no direct survival benefit. We treat them like family members, grieve when they die and structure our lives around their needs.

From an evolutionary or anthropological perspective what purpose does pet keeping serve? I understand working animals like dogs that herd, cats that hunt rodents, horses for transportation. But modern pet ownership often has nothing to do with utility. People keep animals purely for companionship and emotional connection. Is this behavior unique to humans? Do other species form bonds with animals outside their own kind without a clear survival reason?

Some theories I've heard:

\- Pets fulfill social needs, especially in isolated or individualistic societies

\- Caring for animals might trigger parenting instincts

\- Domestication created a feedback loop where animals and humans co-evolved emotional bonds

But I'm curious what current anthropological research actually says. Is pet keeping a relatively recent cultural development or does it go back further than we think? Are there human societies that historically didn't keep pets at all? I was sitting on my balcony with a coffee this morning watching my neighbor walk three dogs and it hit me how strange it is that we've collectively decided to dedicate this much resources and emotional energy to other species.

What does the evidence show? Is there a deeper evolutionary or social function to pet ownership or is it just a byproduct of domestication and modern lifestyle?",43,1764112298.0,AskAnthropology,4,0.83,False

1p6rlpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNoFap/comments/1p6rlpg/how_to_fix_porn_induced_erectile_dysfunction/,How To Fix Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction.,"There are a number of reasons why watching porn causes a person to have erectile dysfunction. And when I use the term erectile dysfunction, I mean that the person is unable to get an erection while he is being intimate with a real person. This is quite damaging to the self-image of the person that you are being intimate with and damaging to your own confidence as a man, knowing that you cannot satisfy the needs of your spouse.

**Reason - 1**  
The first reason why porn causes an erectile dysfunction is simply due to the fact that it is significantly more stimulating than real life intimacy. Think about what an average porn session might look like, you are browsing through dozens of naked women, different shapes and sizes, doing absolutely whatever you can think off. This releases an absurd about of dopamine into your brain and causes you to get desensitized to the lower dopamine release from real life intimacy.

**Reason - 2**  
The second reason that contributes to erectile dysfunction is that fact that most people when they are viewing porn, they are masturbating to it, and it is usually with a firm grip. What this does is that, once, again it desensitizes your genitals to all other forms of softer touch.

**Reason - 3**  
The third reason why you might experience erectile dysfunction is due to you having developed fetishes. Years of watching porn and pursuing strange and novel experiences has led you to develop fetishes. Not your brain has been rewired to only associates those strange sexual acts with pleasure. All other forms of intimacy are no longer that exciting to your brain.

**Can you recover?**  
The good news is that you can fully recover from a porn induced erectile dysfunction. Your brain has the ability to rewire itself and this is known as neuroplasticity. With the right protocols you can bring your brain back to it default settings and heal your erectile dysfunction.

**How long does it take to recover?**  
The answer to this question entirely depends on how bad the damage is. If you have been watching porn for decades and you have been using it multiple times a day, then obvious, it is going to take a bit longer to recover. Additionally, if you strictly adhere to the protocols that I am going to describe, then your recovery is going to accelerate significantly. Lastly, your time for recovery, strongly depends on how many relapses you have. If you are still relapsing every few days or every week, then recovery is going to take far longer.

But let's say you are strictly adhering to all the protocols that I describe, and you have a good system in place that prevents you from relapsing, then I would say that most people can make a full recovery in 1-6 months (just my opinion).

# The foundation

This part of the protocol is going to sound very cliche, yet it something that plays a critical role in your recovery. These are your 3 core pillars of health: your sleep, your diet and exercise. Each of these things significantly impact your brain health and its ability to rewire itself.

**Sleep**  
If you are someone who has terrible sleep hygiene: you go to bed at random times, you don’t get adequate hours of sleep, you view bright lights from your cellphone or laptop before bed, you don’t get enough sunlight during the day, you have stimulants like coffee or energy drinks close to bedtime, then guess what, your sleep quality is going to be quite terrible and a result your recovery is going to be rather slow.

Additionally, poor sleep quality can also put you at risk of relapsing, because sleep has shown to play a significant role when it comes to impulse control and if your impulse control is compromised due to poor sleep, then you are putting yourself in a pretty vulnerable position.

If you are someone who is really looking to optimize their sleep, I would highly recommend that you watch one of Andrew Huberman’s podcasts on sleep optimization. It covers all things that you need to know in order to have high quality sleep. Things like: What time to eat? What time to view sunlight? How long to view sunlight? what time to avoid light?

**Diet**  
Recovery happens when your brain stops receiving hyper stimulation and in the absence of hyperstimulation, it begins to recalibrate itself. One of the ways it does so, is by improving the sensitivity and the number of its dopamine receptors to now accommodate for the fact that there is no longer that flood of dopamine coming in from pornography. However, If you are someone that consumes a lot of processed food. Things like chocolates, burgers, soda, chips etc. Then you might be greatly slowing down your recovery. That’s because you are flooding your brain with dopamine and now it doesn’t get the chance to recalibrate itself.

You don’t want to just quit one addiction and replace it with another addiction. You want to give your brain a window during which it is not being bombarded with hyperstimulation. Additionally, another property of fast food is that it generates cravings for instant pleasure. You might have noticed this, each time you consume highly processed food, like a chocolate cake, your cravings for sex just skyrocket and this puts you in quite a vulnerable position and could lead to a relapse.

What I would recommend is that you really focus on cleaning out your diet. Remove all processed food from it and replace it with whole natural single ingredient food. Things like meat, eggs, honey, dates, fruits, vegetables. These are quality ingredients that assist in healing your brain rather than help destroy it.

**Exercise**  
Exercise is not just about shaping muscles, losing weight, or improving athletic performance. When you exercise and really get that sweat going, then you brain is soaked in a cocktail of neurochemicals that are just so nourishing for it.

Exercise is not only going to help your brain rewire faster and heal your erectile dysfunction, but it is also going fill the void that was left behind by porn and it absolutely essential to fill this void with healthy sources of dopamine, else you are going to be vulnerable to relapses.

# Speeding up your recovery

Once you are no longer relapsing and you have your 3 core pillars of health fixed. Your diet is good, your sleep is good, and you are working out consistently. Then you are on your way to recover successfully from erectile dysfunction. It might take a couple of months, so just stick to your healthy habits and trust the process.

**Signs that you have recovered.**  
One way that you can get some sort of a hint that your erectile dysfunction has been cured is that fact that you will start getting morning wood and you will get frequent erections even at times when you are not looking at something sexually arousing.

So don’t try to see if your erectile dysfunction is cured by looking at porn of hypersexualized images, I have seen people try this time and time again and it just ends up in relapses and undoing your progress.

I am now going to tell you about 2 tools, that in my opinion, will significantly speed up your recovery. It might just take you half or even a third of time to recover if you incorporate these tools in your life.

**Tool 1 - Fasting**  
The first tool is fasting. Going without food for a duration of time has shown to significantly boost neuroplasticity and this allows your brain to recover much faster.

The reason why fasting is so effective is because when you voluntarily deprive your body of food, then it switches its source of energy and it starts using your fat as fuel. When this energy switch happens, your body gets the message that ‘there is a scarcity of resources’ and this causes it to start cleaning itself and burning of dysfunctional cells as a source of energy. This process is known as autophagy and fasting plays a key role in promoting it.

Additionally, fasting promotes something called neurogenesis, which is the creation of new neurons. This combination of autophagy and neurogenesis is vital for rewiring your brain and with fasting you can accelerate both these mechanisms.

**Tool 2 - Ketogenic Diet**  
Now fasting is great, but you can’t fast forever 24 hours day, 7 days a week. Or perhaps you are someone who is on the skinny side of things or you are someone who really cares about his performance in the gym or there could be many other reasons why you are not looking forward to the idea of fasting.

However, you can still get the benefits of fasting: the autophagy and neurogenesis by following a fasting mimicking diet, which is called the ‘ketogenic diet’. You might have come across it in passing, it seems to have picked up some steam in communities centered around weight loss. But it is also just a fantastic tool when it come to getting the benefits of fasting, without actually fasting. To put it simply, a ketogenic diet is when you consume little carbs, typically between 20-50 gms and mainly consume fats and proteins.

**To the skeptics**  
Now some of you are probably skeptical about the effectiveness of intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet, especially when it comes to overcoming porn addiction and, to be fair, there hasn’t been a relevant study done on the impact on ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting on porn addiction.

However, there are studies that have shown that the ketogenic diet has a positive impact on substance use disorders. There are studies that show that ketogenic diet helps reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. And lastly, there is a study that shows that ketogenic diet also reduces cravings for alcohol.

So granted that none of these things are actually porn. However, these substances behave very similar to porn, meaning they release large amounts of dopamine and are addictive. It is my hypothesis, based on my experience working with dozens of porn addicts, that ketogenic diet could be a potential tool that helps rewire the brain from porn addiction and reduce cravings for porn.

I’m not against GTO. I just prefer to win more often.

I can’t agree more. And that’s why we need « Intelligent » solvers, that can recognize and adapt to various player profiles.

The old generation of « pure mathematics » solvers are now proven to be loosing propositions. 

Not only you never understand why should take a particular line, but also, you are just going to loose a ton against those various players you will face : the old man coffee, the glass canon, the spewtard, the « Hoodie GTO expert » etc.",1,1764111868.0,PokerSolvers,1,1.0,False

1p6rgow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1p6rgow/ibs_with_variable_stool_consistency_and/,IBS with variable stool consistency and difficulty passing gas”,"Damn, this process started a year ago and has ruined my life.
I used to go to the bathroom daily, at the same time every day, regularly. My stools were healthy, dark brown, and I felt completely empty after bowel movements—what days those were…
One day, I started feeling fullness in my liver. Liver tests showed 0–1 degree of fatty liver. This sensation pressed on my liver and back, towards my lower back and waist. I still haven’t figured out if it’s gas. It feels like there’s a balloon under my liver. At the same time, my stool started changing: its color shifted from dark brown to light brown. The consistency became looser, and the smell changed. Besides the disgusting stool odor, there was now a sour-bitter smell.
Then I started having diarrhea. My stool became lumpy and loose, like a bitter sauce—not completely watery diarrhea. My stool started fluctuating between solid and diarrhea. I began seeing mucus in the solid portions. The color was so unclear that the tomato-based foods I ate made it look like it was streaked with blood.
Then I started examining my stool more closely. I found foul-smelling, mold-like pieces inside. I’ll share these. This continued for 8 months, and I didn’t have problems with gas or passing gas.
In the last two months, I’ve been going through hell. My stool went crazy and became chronically soft-pasty. It started constantly changing colors: light brown, brick red, green, very dark brown. The consistency has always been between loose and pasty.
One day, I saw extremely dark stool particles, like goat droppings, in my pasty stool.
Another day, I saw a solid-like stool surrounded by loose, pasty stool.
Another day, the front was solid and the rest loose.
The most absurd case was two days ago: the left and right sides of my stool were different at the start and end—one side green, the other light brown. I can’t write curse words because it might get removed, but I feel like I want to tear my intestines apart.
This process has exhausted me. Interestingly, I don’t know if what I eat affects me.
I can’t find the root problem. I ate only boiled chicken and salad for a week. Nothing changed in gas or stool.
When I wake up in the mornings, I feel a deep ache and extreme tension in my right quadrant. This tension seems to radiate from my intestines toward under my liver, but I don’t know if it’s gas or intestinal sensitivity.
I stopped the diet for a week and ate everything the next day—sweets, sugar, milk, milky coffee, hamburger, extra fries, and onion rings. What happened? Nothing.
Tests I’ve had done:
Contrast-enhanced full abdominal MRI – normal
Contrast-enhanced full abdominal CT – normal
Liver MRI – normal
Small intestine MRI – normal
10 abdominal ultrasounds – 0–1 degree fatty liver
Blood tests – celiac, thyroid, general blood, autoimmune panel, rheumatoid disease panel – all normal
I’m waiting for comments and for people who experience the same symptoms as me.",1,1764111809.0,ibs,0,1.0,False
