Anywhere else similar?","Hi, me and SO both early/mid 30s are looking to move to London/Surrey border and Sanderstead (near the station as I know the actual town is further from the station) or Coulsdon seem good options but I'm wondering if there are any other places you'd recommend?

Our requirements:

- 3 bed ¬£500kish, can go higher if needed for right place
- Quick into London, Thameslink is ideal, and ideally in London fare zones. We like the look of Sanderstead and Coulsdon as you can get a train to London Bridge in about 20 mins
- Good community spirit, I'd like to know our neighbours, chat with people in the street etc.
- Good infant/primary schools nearby (we don't have kids yet but probably in next couple of years)
- Enough going on we feel like we don't have to go into London for everything, doesn't need to be thriving but some good pubs, restaurants, coffee shops etc.

Thanks in advance

1gk1vtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1gk1vtj/functional_medicine_experience/,functional medicine experience,"hi! I have been working with a functional medicine doctor to address my issues with fibromyalgia, CFS, POTS, and digestive issues, among others, for the past three months. 

In combination, I am also getting acupuncture and cupping done, am on a restrictive anti-inflammatory diet, and swim for 30-40 mins every day (very gently of course). I am also on HRT (25 mg daily of testosterone gel). I am mentioning these because any changes in my symptoms are also invariably linked to these and are not limited to functional medicine alone.

What‚Äôs worked for me so far:
- getting comprehensive testing done, in which my doctor looks not only at markers beyond ranges, but patterns within all markers as well. she is working on balancing nutrition, hormones, and inflammatory markers (mine are generally high). 
- taking dietary fiber and collagen supplements every morning with my coffee. my digestive health is better than it‚Äôs been in years.
- supplementing my diet with a range of very specific natural supplements (currently I‚Äôm on BSO, Baicalin, Thyrodol, Alomac, vitex berry, carnitine, ginger, dandelion, Vit D, Vit C, Vit E, and a multivitamin)
- regular check ins where dosages are adjusted according to how I‚Äôm feeling

What hasn‚Äôt worked:
- Ozone IV infusions !!!! This was a terrible experience, I reacted badly to the Ozone, which gave me superficial thrombophlebitis. Almost a week in and I still have pain and swelling around the infusion point.
- The cost ‚Ä¶. I am not sure how much longer I can afford this to be honest
- The very slow pace of improvements 

In terms of changes I‚Äôve noticed 
- Digestive health improved greatly (no IBS flare since week 2, otherwise I would have at least 2 days of diarrhea a week if not more)
- Slightly more managed POTS symptoms (this could be the testosterone though)
- Muchhhhh fewer allergic responses even to known allergens. I can actually digest gluten now without any reaction at all, which is unbelievable. I used to break out in hives with even a couple of bites
- Quicker bounce back time than usual after exertion (again this could be the t)
- Less creaky joints in the morning (this could be the acupuncture)

In terms of pain, fatigue, brain fog, and so on, I am still at a pretty high level, and my daily functioning is limited to maybe 1-2 hours of activity with breaks. I don‚Äôt have complete faith that these alternative interventions will cure anything but I am grateful for the help, however small, and intend on continuing.

One of the most important aspects of this journey has been spending time with a medical professional who does not for a second doubt or underplay my symptoms. She cares deeply, checks in often, does research in her own time to understand me better. Shes open to feedback and takes me very seriously if I react badly to something, don‚Äôt like it, even if I say it tastes bad lol. 

Happy to take any questions if anyone has about the treatments/supplements/etc! And would love to hear your experiences too with alt medicine. In the past I‚Äôve also tried homeopathy, ayurveda, acupressure, chiropractic treatment, and massage therapy - none of those had any significant benefits for me, but I‚Äôll try anything once if you have any more suggestions üòáüòÖ",1,1730794196.0,Fibromyalgia,0,1.0,False

I started to hand him a slip of paper with my number and said that if he's not seeing anyone else, I'd like to grab coffee sometime. He then told me, ""Unfortunately, I am seeing someone currently."" 

Was he likely just being polite by returning a compliment? I feel hung up on the interaction and I'm struggling to understand if he was just being cordial or if it was really a moment of chemistry. 

Of course, I don't want to pursue anything with a man while they're in a relationship, but I'm wondering if this means he might be open to reconnecting if he ends up single again down the line. ",2,1730794110.0,dating,2,1.0,False

1gk1um4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StaffordBullTerriers/comments/1gk1um4/puppy_whining/,Puppy whining,"Hi,

two weeks ago I got staffy puppy (now is 11 weeks old). I have some behaviours about him I'd like to change but didn't figure out how:

1. Whining when not getting what he wants - at the beginning I thought it was about being lonely but (1) he does not whine when he's sleeping on my bed/is super comfortable and (2) he does that even when I'm with him but he has no access to treats on shelf or to another room where my flatmate is. I made his exercise pen comfortable (toys, bed, water, kongs with food etc), only other thing I can think of is softer bed (he seem to like pillows and sleeping on laundry). I try some activities that should help him get comfortable with being alone but does not seem to work well. What I do is, in expen I give him licking mat with a little peanut butter and I leave room for some time so he learns that me leaving means something good. He is fine with that but whenever I leave him there without special treat he starts whining (I come back only after he calms himself down). What else can I do to help him feel good alone?

2. Biting - I noticed he often does that when he's over excited and over tired (understandable) but sometimes it seems to just be his instinct or way to play. I try to do the ""if bite then any interaction is over"" so he learns that it does not pay off. He has toys to chew on (he likes ropes, sometimes rubber toys, and coffee tree wood) but even if I have these in my hand, he often goes for my flesh. This might be caused a bit by recent visit of my sister and some behaviours of my flatmate - playing with hands and making him chase the fingers/hand... Any ideas on how to reduce (or redirect) biting?

Other thing we mostly have under control - toilet training is 90% working, sleep-eat-play schedule is also pretty clear, I try some light training with him (name, ""yes"" and ""no"", play tug). I struggle a bit to build connection with him, so he sees value in me not in treat I have in my hand...

I get to the office quickly and start filling my brain with coffee, doing some tasks before a meeting in a few minutes, and then diving into my work.

We can explore our agreements and disagreements‚Äîbe prepared for my honest opinions about everything, especially if you say that stars in the sky can tell what our personalities are like, lol.

We can joke around and chat a lot; if the vibe is good, we‚Äôll have our inside jokes.

Yesterday, I sent a screenshot someone had sent me about this same Ambassador (Himmel) supposedly selling PLU, I tried to nicely ask about it. 

Funny part is - he tried to contradict me with arguments that really didn't answer my question, it was more of cold attacking me for no reason. 

Then he pulled a Danial and asked me ""to delete my messages"" to which I said, I wouldn't as it would remove the context to the conversation and the proof, where I wasn't even mean to him. Anyways, problem is - This is similar to what Danial said to Coffee and how this Ambassador is reacting to me. 

So question is - Does Himmel want to become the next ""Volunteer paid moderator""? Does he want to get hired to be Plutus Staff for being exactly like Danial in a way? He also reminds me of Iulian, so I really wonder if he is just undercover staff doing empty threats. ",5,1730792601.0,Plutus_Uncensored,2,0.86,False

Hi all! Not sure to what put here.. So I'll make this up as I go, I guess. I'm 39/F, living in Cali, just looking for some fun folks to DM here or on Discord and kill some time with. Please don't message though if you're gonna do 1-3 words at a time. I'd like an actual conversation.

Best way to get my attention is via a DM. I'm likely not gonna be checking replies/notifications on this post.

Hobbies of mine include:

Video Games - Recently beat Baldur's Gate 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. I just started Dragon Age: The Veilguard the other day. I play tons of genres though. Even toss in a few rounds of CoD from time to time.

Horror Movies - Horror is life. Especially a lot of the older stuff. Not to say that new stuff can't be good too, though, because it certainly can. Recent obsession is the Terrifier series.

Music - I lean heavily towards rock and metal, but I'll listen to almost anything. Angus McSix is my favorite band, it's power metal. I'm always open to new suggestions.

Also a big (American) football fan, if anyone out there would like to talk about that.

1gk1fxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1gk1fxt/today_i_almost_ended_it/,Today I almost ended it. ,"


So tonight I ran away from home. 
Tonight I almost ended it. 
Here‚Äôs some context-
As I‚Äôve aged, my pmdd has become more and more unbearable and my period longer and longer (almost 2.5 weeks of bleeding now). I‚Äôm 41. 

I‚Äôve also been forced to move into my parent‚Äôs home. And ruin my mother‚Äôs vision of her retirement; as she‚Äôs reminded me of on multiple occasions. I ‚Äútook over‚Äù her sewing room. It‚Äôs been a huge adjustment for us all. I moved out at 19 because of her mental illnesses putting me in danger, and was forced to move in with them at 36 because of my declining health and losing my home (one third owned a home and the other two thirds needed to relocate). 

So now I‚Äôm in perimenopause. Have Cptsd. Several debilitating diseases. And am just now unmasking my autism. This has made things so much worse. Like colossally worse. 

My dad has always been safe. And it bothers my mom. She‚Äôs called me some very concerning names over the years. She doesn‚Äôt address or admit or acknowledges anything hurtful she has done. She‚Äôs always been this way. She has incredible trauma from childhood and will not seek treatment or support. 
Now dad, he drives me to appointments all the time. He cooks and cleans and takes care of almost everything. 
And I do all that I can, when I can. 

Recently I‚Äôve been pushing myself to do more as my mother injured her ankle. Last time I did this I ended up in the hospital from pushing too hard. 
I think overextending myself has caused my pmdd to become severely worse. I‚Äôm curious if this is experienced by anyone else? 

My autism seems to be more pronounced as well, especially during pmdd time. 

So, when my mother made a racist comment during coffee with family, I shut down and left the room.  Peak luteal phase and autistic shutdown. 
I texted both parents about it; that I heard the comment and it wasn‚Äôt ok. 
Yes, my text was long and detailed. 
At no point did I call them anything bad or tell them they were horrible people. 
But I did call out the statement she made. The statement was racist. 
Then they avoided me for 2 full days. Not a word. Wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. 

I was told I was a deep feeler, but was super hurtful and uncalled for. And of course I‚Äôm safe there (regardless of not feeling safe). And I wasn‚Äôt even part of the conversation and I called them racists and hurt their feelings. And they don‚Äôt want to deal with me as I‚Äôm drama. 

And I spent the last two days trying to keep myself from killing myself. Unnoticed. A super sad ghost in their home. 

Like. I don‚Äôt get it. We‚Äôre taught from childhood to not do or say harmful things to or about others, ideally by our parents. But even as we age, we‚Äôre not permitted to hold our parents to the same standards? 

I‚Äôve apologized so many times for being a burden and needing help. I feel like my existence, sense of justice, etc are all too much and just intrinsically hurt them. 

I feel so trapped. I have nowhere to go. No job because of my illnesses. I have high needs. And parents I live with who feel unsafe. Who I also depend on. I‚Äôm acutely aware of my existence being inconvenient and expensive. 

I‚Äôm at a loss. The idea of just melting into the ether sounds so good to me. Lay down in some moss and become part of the microbiome or whatever. 
But I‚Äôd be leaving a high needs and super reactive dog who needs care all the time. She wouldn‚Äôt know or understand. They wouldn‚Äôt give her the constant enrichment and attention she needs to thrive. And I‚Äôd be leaving a mother who would fall apart and leave herself in pieces for the family to put back together while they‚Äôre trying to survive. I can‚Äôt leave them like that. 

So I just ran away from home. I‚Äôm sleeping on a friends couch. My dog is not with me, because my friend has a dog. And mine is a reactive and anxious mess. I called some helplines. 
But I‚Äôm so disillusioned by the healthcare system. And so tired of it all. All of it. It was suggested I go to emerge. But the multiple hours of waiting in pain and tears in an overstimulating place to be spoken to condescendingly is not ideal. 

I‚Äôll call the resources given to me tomorrow as I sit on their couch with their dog. 

I guess what I‚Äôd love to know is, do you experience heightened symptoms of your co-morbidities? Your neurodivergence? Does it make it harder for your family/partner to function or help you? 

I‚Äôm sorry if my writing isn‚Äôt super coherent. I‚Äôve been crying for days. My insomnia is raging despite meds. I‚Äôm exhausted. And I think I need some community.

Unfortunately my old grinder can't grind fine enough for it, so I'm resorting to preground until I can decide on one that can.

It seems that one grind size is great for double shots while useless for singles and vice versa. Is this a thing? Photo above is from my attempts at pulling a single shot with a coffee that provides wonderful doubles. 

I'm using the single dose portafilter, putting it around 12gr of coffee (scales are my next upgrade), tamp it and lock it in. It does the usual 7 second preinfusion and then trickles like this until the 25"" mark. Pressure climbs easily to 9-10bar and stays there. 

Coarser grinds work well with the single portafilter but produce runny doubles. Am I doing something wring or is this normal? ",0,1730791726.0,espresso,6,0.5,False

I went on a few dates with a guy my age who I met on a dating app. He seemed to check so many of the boxes for what I‚Äôm looking for in a partner. After our second date, we slept together, and I think that may have made things more complicated for me.

Right after that, I became really nervous, and looking back, I think I started to self-sabotage. I grew up with no confidence and in the last couple of years I‚Äôve gained so much! And it seemed like I was back to how I was a few years ago telling myself no way is this guy actually into you. On our last date, I was playing host, I was really anxious, wanting everything to go perfectly.

The next day, he let me know he didn‚Äôt want to meet up again. I kind of saw it coming, but it still hurt. What‚Äôs getting to me most is that I don‚Äôt feel like I showed my true self‚ÄîI was just too wrapped up in my nerves.

I‚Äôm also neurodivergent, and dating at this age without much experience is not fun. I‚Äôve had a few dates but none that I‚Äôve actually liked or that even turned into a second date.

My question is: Would it be worth a shot if I reach out and let him know I don‚Äôt think I represented myself well? Maybe ask if he‚Äôd be open to meeting again for something casual, like coffee, just so I don‚Äôt wonder ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù And just see where that lands and if it‚Äôs a no go just letting it go?

Is this salvageable? ,"It sounds terrible when I read that in isolation but let me explain. I (29M) had been with someone (28F) who lived a distance away for several years then Covid (2020-2021) happened and we grew apart. I saw them once when Covid restrictions lifted somewhat at the end of 2021‚Äìwe met and had a coffee and caught up. I don‚Äôt know why, but I just couldn‚Äôt find the courage to formally break up. We just wasn‚Äôt a thing, we hardly spoke and didn‚Äôt see each other again in person and eventually stopped talking altogether. Enter my partner (29F) who has been in my life for years as a friend, but wanted to be friends with benefits. She knew I was with someone, but I was frank and said things weren‚Äôt going to last between us. We then slowly started to see one another casually, nothing with labels, it was largely friends with benefits. This would have been around November 2021. My partner began to feel bad about the blurred lines between the relationships, and would ask if it was over and I would say yes, because it felt like it was. 

Fast forward to 2023, me and my partner have had a lot of ups and downs. Shes ended our informal relationship several times. At one point openly said that she met someone at work she wanted to try things with and dropped me to pursue that. It fizzled out and she decided to travel instead, returning because she‚Äôd run out of cash in late 2023. We caught up and we slowly resumed where had been. Throughout this she‚Äôs always been clear that we are faithful to one another, if we want to pursue other people fine, but be open about it‚ÄîI never did want to. Now it‚Äôs 2024, we were meant to meet to have a conversation about us and the future‚Äîit felt like things might actually become serious. But 30 minutes before the meeting she messaged to say she‚Äôd contacted my ex and couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd lied (presumably about not formally ending things). I‚Äôm a bit puzzled how an ex relationship that ended in what felt like 2019 has somehow ended something that has been so informal since 2021. Am I being an idiot? Is this salvageable?

TW for neglect, and narcissistic abuse.

Sometimes, I feel like what I went through ""wasn't that bad."" And then I casually bring it up, and people's reactions once again remind me that no, the way I was disciplined as a child wasn't normal. I wasn't beaten, or starved, or assaulted. I just had a narcissistic stepmom and a dad who was abused, but also a pushover? 

I love my dad, and we have an okay relationship now, but I can't forget or forgive the things I went through. It was his idea to buzz my head, my stepmom made him follow through. She told him to pin me by my neck to show me how helpless I was. He was equally as cold when I was grounded. I hate it now that he has actually picked up little things from her, little behaviors that I know weren't there before. And I hate that I empathize with him, because he was also a victim of her. But why didn't he leave? Or protect me? He said himself that he didn't really agree with her punishments for me, and he even showed me proof online of her being a narcissist while they were still together. But he was asking for validation from a child! One who was too scared to give against the power on the house to even speak freely.

She was awful. She pit my whole family -me, my dad, and my autistic brother- against each other. And she had it out for me, specifically. I was in the doghouse the most. And honestly, I'm surprised that I turned out fine. My brother and I were homeschooled, but not properly. The parents rarely taught us anything. They would buy us one school work book (like Kumon math or critical thinking) and then buy us each one notebook, where we had to copy every problem onto the paper, then answer it. And they wouldn't even grade it, that was up to us too. They weren't even around to make sure we did our schoolwork either. They would leave us home for 10+ hours almost everyday. And then of course, when I got in trouble, education ""became a privilege,"" and I would have to deep clean the house, stare at a wall, or write an endless amount of sentences.

I spent a total of seven years in that hell with my stepmom. And what really hurts is that...I loved her. My bio mom is a meth addict, and wasn't in the picture. So the stepmom stood in for her. She used to tell me bedtime stories, tell me I was the daughter she never had, do my hair and take me shopping. As I grew older, I became her right hand man. She had sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune disease) and she would have a hard time getting out of bed for months at a time when she had flare ups. I took care of her. I ran her baths, cooked her food, made her coffee, tried to make her comfortable as she ached. I also helped her with all of her failed businesses, from teaching yoga & reiki to both online and in person shopping stores. All of this, from 9 to 15 years old. I was a kid. Why did she pick me? For the abuse? Because I am a girl? The only competition in the house? 

I never even got closure. I still hurt. I still have dreams with her in them where I can't do anything. I can't fight back, or speak, or run away. And I was in therapy for 9 months, but I basically was already aware of what was going on with my head, so it didn't help much. I just...hurt. Like, she gets away with making me sleep in the front yard, making me wear boy clothes with buzzed hair, making my family homeless multiple times, and isolating me from my family with no repercussions? While I get to just sit here, and try not to remember what her face looks like, while my dad tries to justify some of her actions with excuses like ""you weren't an easy child,"" or ""look at all the good she's done for you and your brother.""

My sister(15) is kinda struggling with her job.
(We‚Äòre in europe and can start working after we completed the 9 years school by law)

She‚Äòs working at a library and at first she had problems getting there bcs the way is 1h and 30mins, after a while I think we got kinda used to it, but now she told me she wants to have a job where she can also do a tiny kinda break and do her stuff aswell
Like, she works 8h and can not just stand around(which is logical cuz she just started) but, it‚Äòs hard. I understand the pov of her company and the rules and that, but I feel bad for her
Being exhausted when she get‚Äòs home, needing to get up at 6:30am and coming home at 6:00pm in the night.

We live in a village far from jobs that are not about tourists and all that, we don‚Äòt really have the money to rent an appartment(with supervision) for her and I can‚Äòt think of a job that might just work better for her.

I‚Äòm not her manager or anyone to decide what‚Äòs best for her, if she wants to stay in the job she‚Äòs in, that‚Äòs fine for me and I‚Äòll try to help her as much as I can. Even cooking maybe(I hate cooking).
I want to support her as much as I can but can not think of a job that
1) doesn‚Äòt involve much around people
2) has ppl giving their own time
3) isn‚Äòt thaaaat far away
4) involves her interests(books, (maybe that helps?:) korean stuff like k-pop, drawing)

She said she likes her job in the ground basics, like she can get a coffee or tea whenever, her colleges are sweet(except for 2 elderly ones) and she can just randomly take 5minutes.
She likes books and manga and it seems awesome
But I see why she‚Äòs upset about the times and the much work.

In my country you have to get teached about the job until you‚Äòre 18.(Lehre)
So you can‚Äòt just apply to any job, specially if you didn‚Äòt have a Lehre or specific school degree.

Maybe a office job?

I just came here to ask if any of you have an idea for an ‚Äûeasy‚Äú job for me to recommend her.
I do not want her to quit, I just want to help her and take some things off her mind. I worry that she‚Äòs gonna get depressed bcs of her job or something.
(I‚Äòll only recommend her and not tell her to quit or do the job‚Äòs I recommend, I just want her to have more options if she decides to do what she wants.)

1gk0xia,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1gk0xia/how_to_choose_the_perfect_ceramic_vase_for_every/,How to Choose the Perfect Ceramic Vase for Every Room in Your Home,"[Ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/ceramic-vases) are timeless decor pieces that add elegance, texture, and personality to any space. Choosing the right vase style and color can significantly impact the aesthetic and ambiance of each room. Here‚Äôs a guide to help you select the perfect ceramic vase for every room in your home, along with tips on how to incorporate popular styles like white ceramic vases and [glass vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/vases/glass-vases) to achieve a cohesive look.

**1. Living Room: A Statement Piece with Texture and Contrast**

The living room is the heart of your home, often serving as a gathering space for family and guests. When selecting a ceramic vase for this area, consider going bold with a large, textured piece that acts as a statement. [White ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase) are particularly versatile, offering a clean and modern aesthetic that pairs well with various color schemes. Place your vase on a coffee table, console, or side table, and add fresh or dried flowers to bring in a natural element.

Tip: Pair a white ceramic vase with contrasting accessories like wooden or metallic decor to add depth and character to your living room.

**2. Dining Room: Elegant and Sophisticated**

For the dining room, choose a ceramic vase that complements your table setting. A slender, tall vase with a simple design works well as a centerpiece, especially if you opt for a pair of glass vases on either side to create symmetry. Glass vases add a touch of transparency and elegance, allowing the colors of your flowers or decor to shine. If your table is round, consider a single white ceramic vase in the center to make a chic statement without overwhelming the space.

Tip: Match the color of your vase with your table runner or placemats to achieve a cohesive look in your dining area.

**3. Bedroom: Serene and Calming Ambiance**   

In the bedroom, ceramic vases should contribute to a calming, restful atmosphere. Opt for soft, neutral tones like white ceramic vases, which are perfect for creating a serene vibe. Place a smaller vase on a bedside table or dresser with minimalistic flowers, such as baby‚Äôs breath or eucalyptus, to maintain a gentle, soothing aesthetic.

Tip: Choose ceramic vases with soft, curved shapes to add a touch of femininity and warmth to the bedroom, making it feel cozy and inviting.

**4. Bathroom: Small but Stylish Additions**   

Bathrooms benefit from simple, smaller ceramic vases that add a touch of elegance without taking up too much space. A compact white ceramic vase on the vanity or a shelf can bring an instant lift to the room. You can also consider a small glass vase filled with fresh greenery or succulents to add a refreshing natural touch to the space.

Tip: Use a set of two or three mini ceramic vases for a playful look on larger countertops. Mixing ceramic and glass vases can also add visual interest and variety to smaller spaces like bathrooms.

**5. Kitchen: Fresh and Functional Decor**   

While often overlooked, the kitchen is a great place to add a touch of personality with a ceramic vase. Go for a more functional design here by choosing a wide-mouth vase that can double as a utensil holder or a vase for fresh herbs. White ceramic vases work well in kitchens, as they add a clean look that complements various kitchen themes. Place it on your countertop, near the sink, or on a windowsill for a fresh pop of decor.

Tip: Combine practicality with style by choosing a ceramic vase in a shape that complements your kitchen‚Äôs layout. Consider a glazed finish that can handle a bit of moisture and still look beautiful.

**6. Entryway: Welcoming First Impressions**   

The entryway is your home‚Äôs first impression, so choose a ceramic vase that makes a bold, welcoming statement. Consider placing a larger white ceramic vase or glass vase on a console table near the entrance, filled with seasonal flowers or branches to set the tone for the rest of your decor. This area can handle a bit more drama, so don‚Äôt shy away from experimenting with unique shapes or intricate textures.

Tip: Coordinate the color or style of your entryway vase with other nearby decor elements like mirrors, trays, or lighting fixtures to create a cohesive and inviting look.

**Choosing the Right Vase for Your Aesthetic**

When selecting ceramic vases, keep in mind your home‚Äôs overall aesthetic. Here are a few styles and how they fit with different decor:

Modern and Minimalist: Opt for white ceramic vases with clean lines and smooth finishes.

Rustic or Farmhouse: Choose ceramic vases with distressed textures and earthy tones.

Bohemian or Eclectic: Mix ceramic and glass vases in various colors and shapes for a relaxed, vibrant feel.

Traditional: Classic shapes in neutral colors work well in more traditional spaces, adding a sense of timelessness.

**Final Tips for Styling Ceramic Vases in Any Room**

1. Mix and Match Sizes: Combining vases of different heights and widths can add visual interest to a space.

2. Pair with Fresh or Dried Flowers: Seasonal flowers bring freshness, while dried arrangements offer a low-maintenance yet stylish option.

3. Experiment with Locations: Don‚Äôt limit yourself to tabletops; try placing ceramic vases on shelves, windowsills, or even floor spaces for a more unique look.

Choosing the right ceramic vase can truly elevate each room in your home, adding a touch of elegance and charm. From white ceramic vases to transparent glass vases, there‚Äôs a perfect vase for every style and purpose. With the right choice, you‚Äôll bring beauty, balance, and a bit of your personal taste to every corner of your home.",1,1730789881.0,u_homeandsoul,0,1.0,False

*PROLOGUE*

The 1980s. A young boy is at bat for a little league baseball game. Strike one. Strike two‚Ä¶ Calls of ‚Äòeasy out‚Äô and ‚Äòscoot up‚Äô from the other team. His own team looks disgusted. His own dad moans because the kid kept skipping practices to read comics. 

Then, a wave of shimmering nothing passes through. Everyone looks around, confused, but there‚Äôs nothing different. The umpire shrugs and calls out ‚Äòplay ball‚Äô. The pitcher winds up. 

The batter stands taller, more secure. 

A throw. 

A hit.

A home run. 

The dad is cheering and shaking his seatmate, claiming all the extra practices the boy did paid off. Except, the other guy is confused. Didn‚Äôt he just say his kid skipped practices? The dad is confused‚Ä¶ he did, but he also *didn‚Äôt*. 


*ACT I*

Today. The Zetterquist Institute is studying what happened, the ‚ÄúZ-Effect‚Äù. Because it‚Äôs happened a **lot** more. Backstory/infodump: Essentially, our world is currently crashing into/through a lot of parallel worlds. When that happens, bits of those worlds are‚Ä¶ left behind. Attached to ours, like layers of paint on a wall, with bits of the other layers peeking through. 

So, a kid who never practiced batting got the ‚ÄòZ-Effect‚Äô overlay of a version of him that did. Or someone suddenly ‚Äòremembering‚Äô the bestselling novel that another them wrote, and rewriting it. Or discovering that another you was a cat burglar, or the president, or married to someone different. 

Frank Roberts is one of the very very few that *hasn‚Äôt* been overlayed. Because he‚Äôs about the only one of him that didn‚Äôt die during childbirth. So, he‚Äôs a permanent fixture at the Institute, studied as a ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô for other changes. 

He has an ex-wife, who left him after multiple overlays showed that she was married to another (specific) man in every other universe, and those other versions basically ‚Äòoutvoted‚Äô the version that married Frank. 

And, he has a daughter, Jillian. She is in college, drifting a bit aimlessly, as she has no idea what she wants to be. All the other college kids have at least one version of them that was ‚Äòdriven‚Äô, wanting to be a ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô, and they‚Äôre all going along with that passion. (Even a few that have **two** passions they‚Äôre torn between, and doing fairly well at both). 

But Jillian is alone, unique. There‚Äôs no version of her that has a big desire, because there‚Äôs **just HER**. Which is lonely. (Her mother also has less time for her, as her younger half-siblings are all overlayed, and the mom has multiple versions of her with ONLY those kids, with only the one with Jillian). 

She has friends. Even a boyfriend. But she is always worried that they‚Äôll get another overlay, and suddenly Unique Jillian is left alone because they ‚Äòremembered‚Äô their real friends/boyfriend. There are hints that she‚Äôs not coping with these thoughts as well as she‚Äôd like you to believe, but nothing spelled out. 

She visits her dad, and (needing money) agrees to some ‚Äòtesting‚Äô with the Institute. 

They want to try and ‚Äòprovoke‚Äô a specific parallel world crossover. (‚ÄúImagine being able to bring in the version of yourself that was Einstein, Hawking, or Newton. And keep their Genius for yourself!‚Äù) Theoretically, it‚Äôs only been random chance that her dad is the only version of himself. In the infinite branches of reality, there should be more hims‚Ä¶ and more hers. 

They strap her in!

Fire up the machine!

And pull the lever!!!


**ACT II**

She wakes up, and the room is empty, dark. She‚Äôs all alone in there, left strapped to the machine. Climbs out, and wanders the dark hallways, before meeting a security guard. 

He‚Äôs confused. There shouldn‚Äôt be anyone there. She must be a college kid playing a prank / an intern someone played a prank on. Takes her to a small holding room while he figures things out. She has a headache, and he gives her some extra-strength ibuprofen to help, showing he‚Äôs a nice guy just doing his job. 

Waiting, he makes small talk, about how he ended up in this job; his ‚ÄòAlts‚Äô were all professional baseball players, but he wrecked his arm right after high school and can‚Äôt swing a bat (implying he was the kid from the Prologue). She tells him about being Unique, which he kind of wishes he was; his Alts loving baseball basically dragged him along for the ride, because he never cared enough to be different, until it was too late. 

He hasn‚Äôt gotten any response from the scientists (not because it‚Äôs the middle of the night, which it is, but because they turn the darned things off when they‚Äôre busy being eggheads). She mentions she was here for the Forced Overlay Test, and the Guard hangs up the phone. 

He‚Äôs pissed, as the eggheads told him it was **NEXT** Saturday, not today. So, the nurses to watch over their test subject‚Ä¶ Jill‚Ä¶ aren‚Äôt scheduled until then. The eggheads probably just left her behind to study their data, and assumed someone else would take care of her. Since he has no idea where her clothes and personal effects are, he lets her dress up from the Lost & Found, and calls her an Uber back to her dad‚Äôs place. 

Her dad is out. So Jillian uses his hidden key to head in, climb in her childhood room‚Äôs bed, and go to sleep. Hearing her dad come in, she calls out a ‚Äògood night‚Äô and hears him **AND** a woman‚Äôs voice call back‚Ä¶ huh, Frank‚Äôs getting lucky? Good for her dad‚Ä¶

In the morning, she‚Äôs looking at her childhood room, and it looks different. Subtly, but things are just *off*.  She dresses in her clothing (which doesn‚Äôt quite fit right, and she bemoans the weird taste of high school her). And gets a bowl of cereal, which she‚Äôs eating when her dad comes out (all bleary-eyed and ‚ÄòI need my coffee to think‚Äô) to say good morning. She talks to him about her room seeming different, and he says that after a few years of college life everything before that seems smaller, more strange. (She mentions a headache, and she grabs some aspirin). 

And then the woman he was with the last night comes in. Says a friendly hello to Jillian (as if she *knows* Jillian), and starts to make food for her and Frank. Jillian thinks this may be a bigger deal than she thought, and wonders why her dad didn‚Äôt say he was seriously involved with someone. 

Until she finally gets a good look at the woman‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs her mother! Looking different than before; a little thinner, wearing a different style of clothing (less *Mommy Messy* and more *Office Chic*), and more professional hair/makeup. Jillian is confused. 

And then the mom actually looks at Jillian‚Ä¶ and freaks out. Both her and the dad don‚Äôt recognize Jillian, and think she‚Äôs broken in as a prank by their daughter. Jillian is freaking out, confused as hell, and basically has a panic attack and has to leave. 

She uses some money (from her personal secret hiding place in her room) to take the train to campus. Everything else she sees is the same, so she‚Äôs worried that her parents are having an affair, and this was their way of trying to keep her quiet. 

She gets to campus, but is running late. Slides into her class. Her friends give her strange looks, but class is going and they can‚Äôt talk. But after the class, while she‚Äôs trying to ask a question of the Professor, they ditch her. 

She heads to lunch, forgetting she has no money. Spots her boyfriend, and grabs a kiss and asks if he can spot her lunch because she lost her wallet. 

He is confused, because he was chatting up another girl (vaguely similar looks to Jillian, so he has a type). And claims he has zero clue who Jillian is or why she thinks they‚Äôre dating. Jillian is pissed, thinking this is his way of dumping her. 

The other girl, who wasn‚Äôt interested in him anyways, takes Jillian‚Äôs side and offers to escort her back to her dorm room so that boyfriend doesn‚Äôt get weird/stalkery. Talking and realizing they have a lot in common; similar classes, similar thoughts on different places around campus, they even were at the same party a couple days ago but didn‚Äôt see each other there.

They head back, and discover they‚Äôre in the same dorm building. Neat. 

In fact, they‚Äôre on the same floor. Guess they just never met. 

And then Jillian points at her room‚Ä¶ and the other girl is confused. That‚Äôs **her** room. 

She opens the door, and shows it off. It looks almost (but not quite) like it did earlier. Almost the same as Jillian‚Äôs dorm room, but with subtle differences (same as with her childhood bedroom). 

Jillian starts to argue with the other girl, thinking this is some strange prank. That maybe her boyfriend set this up, and she‚Äôs being videotaped as a prank. 

She yells that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Jillian Roberts, and this is Jillian Roberts‚Äô room!‚Äù

The other girl tells her, ‚ÄúNo. this is **Jacqueline** Roberts‚Äô room. And that is me!‚Äù

*ACT III*

The two girls both think the other is pranking them. When there‚Äôs a knock at the door, they call a truce and open it. 

It‚Äôs boyfriend, there to apologize to Jillian. He doesn‚Äôt know what was going on, but he couldn‚Äôt actually recognize her earlier, and is freaking out about it. 

Jaqueline also comes to the door, and he apologizes to her as well. They accept it, and he leaves (to see the doctor), and they turn back to the room. Which is now back to the way that Jillian had it the previous day. They both freak out about this.  

They decide that they need to see the doctor as well, worried that someone slipped them both (and boyfriend) something at the party they went to a couple days ago. 

They walk around campus, and some people recognize Jillian and others recognize Jacqueline. (No one recognizes both, though, which isn‚Äôt obvious). And the guy who threw the party doesn‚Äôt recognize either one of them. He is willing to spitball about what‚Äôs going on, though. Stoner insight. 

‚Ä¶long story short, they finally realize that they have the same parents. They are each other‚Äôs alternates, which seems to break the rules. 

They use stoner‚Äôs phone to call their dad, and discover that they were an IVF baby; one where there was more than one embryos, but only one survived. So, the two worlds had a different child born, and now both are here‚Ä¶ sort of. 

One of their friends, who gave them a ride to the party house, keeps flip-flopping on which of the two that they know. The stoner, able to keep track of that because he‚Äôs stoned, comes up with the idea that the world is currently a spinning coin; sometimes ‚Äòheads/Jillian‚Äô and sometimes ‚Äòtails/Jaqueline‚Äô, and when it finally falls only one of them will be left. 

The two start to argue, initially about how each of them should be the one who stays. Except, as it goes on, they both manage to convince each other that the opposite person‚Äôs world is the better version. 

They both get worked up about it, and take a break from each other to calm down. But they both turn to spying on each other and think that their friends and family are happier with their other lives. 

And then Jillian decides that instead of letting the ‚Äòcoin fall‚Äô on its own, she should help it by making the world be better off with Jacqueline. It starts off small, as she slowly starts to speak her mind about things to her friends. Call them out on stuff that they‚Äôve let slide because ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. 

Except these semi-backfire, and help her friends grow. And it turns out that Jacqueline is doing the same thing. They start to try and one-up each other on their ‚Äòwreck my life‚Äô speed-run. 

And then we get a revelation. A jar of meds to ‚ÄúJ. Roberts‚Äù. Ones prescribed for dealing with thoughts of self-harm. 

*ACT IV*

The attempts to remove themselves turn from light ‚Äòtruth to power‚Äô into more dark attempts. Less wacky. More violent. 

The flips between ‚ÄòJillian world‚Äô and ‚ÄòJacqueline world‚Äô are getting faster/closer together. 

They‚Äôve both come to the idea that the universe needs a bigger nudge. Perhaps‚Ä¶ their own deaths? This gets discussed with the stoner guy (on the phone), because he seems to be the only one that recognizes them both‚Ä¶ possibly because he blonde *neither* of them beforehand (or because he‚Äôs so fucking high, it‚Äôs ambiguous). 

There are a couple half-hearted attempts (by each of them) to end things. But stuff that‚Äôs quickly overcome

Their friends are getting worried about them both, and try to help‚Ä¶ but with them suddenly forgetting the one they‚Äôre helping, **in the middle of the help**, it‚Äôs less effective than you might think. 

Culminates in a rooftop fight. Neither one letting the other jump. And a struggle over the only knife, keeping the other from hurting themself. And doing it all while on a ‚Äògoodbye‚Äô phone call with their oblivious father. 

During the struggle, they accidentally hang up, and try to call him back. But hit the redial for the stoner guy instead (on speaker). He talks with them, kind of half-paying attention. But just as they‚Äôre in the final struggle for the knife, he comes out with a point that stops them both dead‚Ä¶

What if the one that dies turns out to be the world that stays‚Ä¶ because a tragic death is more memorable.

That result is‚Ä¶ yeah, not what they want. 

They take a breather, and head back to the dorm room. Jacqueline, instead of arguing about who gets the bed (as they have been all week) insists that Jillian take it and she sleeps on the floor. 

When Jillian wakes up, Jacqueline is gone. There‚Äôs a note that claims she knows how to change the balance. For real. And it‚Äôs to help Jillian. 

Jillian runs around, to all the places they almost killed themselves at. But doesn‚Äôt find her. Heads back to her room‚Ä¶ which is different than either the Jillian or the Jacqueline versions (not noticed at first). Her boyfriend is there, talking about how the doctor couldn‚Äôt find anything wrong with him. 

Nothing to explain why he forgot Jillian, or *tried to hit on her sister* that he also forgot. 

Record scratch moment. ‚Ä¶what sister?

Her boyfriend is confused. Her twin sister? Her roommate? He points out the room, which she now sees has two beds and stuff from both Jillian and Jacqueline in there. 

She‚Äôs having a panic attack. But takes a coin from boyfriend, and spins it on the table (one that happens to have a line down it, for whatever reason). Slow-mo as it spins on the line. And her voice calls out as the coin edge is touching one side of the line ‚ÄúJacqueline‚Äù, and when the edge is touching the other side of the line ‚ÄúJillian‚Äù

And then it comes to rest, half on each side of the line‚Ä¶ ‚Äú**‚Ä¶both‚Ä¶**‚Äù

She needs to get to Jacqueline, but has no idea where she could be. Boyfriend asks if she means *other* than the appointment at the Z Institute?

Jillian realizes what Jacqueline means to do‚Ä¶ since Jillian doing the experiment meant that their worlds merged, doing it a second time should throw the balance to the ‚Äòmore likely‚Äô possibility and erase the other one. And Jacqueline thinks that she will be the one erased. 

There‚Äôs a race against time to get there‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs already happened. The security guard from earlier helps her in (possibly convinced she was supposed to have the testing done). But the room is empty. Jillian thinks that Jacqueline has erased herself. 

Nope. They actually had the medical people there this time. She‚Äôs in a recovery room, being tested for ill effects. And having her own panic attack about still being there so thinking Jillian is gone.

They see each other, cry, and are glad they‚Äôre both still around. Jillian quick-explains that they are both staying. 

*EPILOGUE*

It‚Äôs a week later. Headed to dinner with their father. The sisters are arguing about something inconsequential with their friends. And about how there were no changes from Jacqueline‚Äôs testing. 

The door to their dad‚Äôs house opens to a young man their age. He asks them what they want. They ask him who he is (Jacqueline: if dad is trying to set me up with a *guy* again‚Ä¶ ugh.)

Their dad pops his head around the corner from another room, and tells the boy ‚ÄúStop messing with your sisters, and let them in already.‚Äù

Boy: ‚ÄúSisters?‚Äù

Sisters: ‚ÄúBrother?‚Äù

I'm new to this speciality coffee I am used to instant coffee from Nescafe. Recently I purchased kaldipress which was recommended by this sub and I have ordered samplers from BT (Attikan, Oak smith, French roast). But all three tastes too bitter as black coffee and also with milk. 
Here's how I make a cup
1. Take 7-8 gm of preground coffee in inverted kaldipress 
2. Take 100 ml of warm water maybe 80-90 degrees approx 
3. Add 50 ml and then stir 10 times and let it sit for 1 min 
4. Then add remaining 50 ml and wait until 2:30 min 
5. Use one metal and one paper filter and then just press.

","Hey Courtney, I wanted to share this story to just make sure I‚Äôm not losing my mind. I‚Äôm a 23-year-old girl, you can call me Rebecca, mainly cause that‚Äôs my name haha. I‚Äôm also 4 months pregnant and I work as an Inn keeper at a bed and breakfast. The Bed and Breakfast is deep in the mountains of Appalachia up a curvy road that takes a good while to get to, this and other reasons is why I decided to get a Jeep when I traded in my car. I needed something that had four-wheel drive and would be able to get me to work. This is all important because I want to establish how isolated I am when I am at work. There is only one way in and out of the parking lot and the lot is rather small, I can see all the cars when I step outside of the front door.¬†

So, I work the overnight shift at the BnB, it is very laid back and I can read my books and watch tv all night which is a dream job for an expecting mother. This happened last week, I came into work and the night was very calm and quiet.¬†

Around 1 in the morning I did have a man come in with his son, the man was probably in his 40s with a beer gut and smelled of cigarettes which made me sick to my stomach and his son was about my age. He was quiet and just stood behind his father at check in. He must have been into sports because he had that‚Ä¶ build.¬†

¬†I checked them in and then they went to their rooms. I watched a couple episodes of Friends. I got up from the sofa in the lobby and walked behind the desk to get my Ziplock bag of Lucky Charms out of my bag and when I came around the corner the son was standing there. He scared the crap out of me and caused me to drop the bag in my hand. I asked him if I could help him, and he asked where the vending machines were. I pointed him in the direction and before he left, he stopped and started watching the tv along with me. We laughed about the joke Joey had just made and then we started talking more, his name was Theo, and he was on his way back to college, his dad wanted to help him get resettled. As we were talking, my car alarm began to go off. I ran outside and Theo followed me. When I stopped the alarm, I noticed that on my door handle was a small rubber duck. Theo and I walked back inside and then on the counter was a bag‚Ä¶ Theo decided to open it for me just in case. It had baby clothes inside that smelled like cigarettes, and pictures of me. From the BnB and even at HOME‚Ä¶¬†¬†Theo opened the letter that was in the bag and it said.¬†

how the sender ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt wait to see me as a Mommy, and if I didn‚Äôt take care of my baby it would be taken from me‚Äù¬†¬†

I was creeped out and I think Theo was too because he said he would just sit up with me for the rest of my shift. I tried to call the police, but they said unless any threats had been made, they couldn‚Äôt do anything for me. Theo explained how ‚Äúducking‚Äù is a thing for people with jeeps, so I thought maybe it was another guest but when we stepped outside there wasn‚Äôt a single jeep in the lot. And there hadn‚Äôt been any all night. Theo and I exchanged numbers because his campus is kind of close to the BnB, so maybe we‚Äôll get coffee sometime, but I just wanted to put this on here and get your opinion‚Ä¶ should I be freaked out?¬†

1gk0pwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1gk0pwo/my_grandma_who_i_love_a_lot_is_driving_me/,My grandma who I love a lot is driving me absolutely nuts and is currently living with me. ,"My grandma is moving into my basement, it‚Äôs currently being renovated and won‚Äôt be done until December. She will have her own private entrance and personal space downstairs with a full kitchen and everything she needs. She also has said how she doesn‚Äôt want to intrude on my life and won‚Äôt bother me. 

While she has been waiting to the Reno to be done she lived with her neighbour for a bit (2 weeks) this didn‚Äôt work out as she got into a fight with them and left. She went to my mom‚Äôs place and stayed there for 3 months. She drove my mom absolute mad to the point her and her husband did everything to never be home. They eventually got into a fight and despite my mom apologizing and begging her to stay she left and went to her brothers house. She stayed there for a month until her brother and his wife kicked her out. My grandma is not easy to get along with. She told me about all the things that bothered her about them and it was stupid stuff and judgmental things! She is so judgemental of everyone‚Äôs life, I can‚Äôt imagine what she thinks of me and mine.

Her brother called me and begged me to come get her so I did. She left on very bad terms with them and said she lost a brother. She is now here in my home. My upstairs is all open concept and there is absolutely zero privacy at all. No private rooms or space. Plus my bedroom is right off the kitchen and living room area. 

Things that are driving me nuts is that she sleeps with her door open and sound travels! She gets in coughing fits at 1am for hours on end and it travels through the whole house and wakes me up. She wakes up super early and starts banging around in the kitchen and making coffee, turning on the tv, talking to my cat‚Ä¶. All while she knows I‚Äôm literally right there in the bedroom off the kitchen and can hear every little creek and crack! 

I‚Äôm a major introvert so this is over stimulating me a lot. I find I wake up when she wakes up, even in the night. I‚Äôm used to being alone! I love my alone time. My cat also has to either stay locked in my room at night or locked out of the room unable to use the bathroom because if I sleep with my door open I will have even less privacy. She doesn‚Äôt expect boundaries either. She is constantly trying to look in my room. I brought her in my room the other day and she was looking all around judging. It made me angry at myself I even allowed her in here. 

She also doesn‚Äôt have the best vision anymore, that‚Äôs why she is moving downstairs and she is constantly spilling stuff and food all over the countertops. If this doesn‚Äôt get cleaned right away she can permanently stain and ruin my counters as they aren‚Äôt sealed at the moment. She also expects me to wait on her hand and foot and is judging everything I do. Makes comments about when I wake up and things of this nature. 


I‚Äôm going away for a couple days and of course she wants to know where I‚Äôm going. I didn‚Äôt tell her. I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really want to get into it right now, I‚Äôve got to go for a couple days is that an issue? I wasn‚Äôt expecting you here right now‚Äù. I‚Äôm a grown fucking adult and I‚Äôm not going to check in with anyone or tell them where I am going. I worked my whole life to get out of my house and not have to answer to anyone, now as an adult I‚Äôm not going back to that. Maybe that was rude of me but if I wanted you to know where I was going, I would have said where I was going. I just feel enraged!!!!!!! I fucking hate this! She also drinks everyday and I rarely drink. She wants me to drink with her and speak to her and spend time with her. Which is fine for short periods of time but I don‚Äôt know where she is going to go now? Nobody wants to take her.


I was very honest with her and said you can‚Äôt stay here. I work from home, I‚Äôm in meetings all day and work in the living room. I can‚Äôt have you walking around while I‚Äôm working and on the phone and in meetings. It‚Äôs too distracting. There is nothing at all to do here and we are practically ontop of eachother. It feels like she is in my bedroom right now because of the coughing. She is still coughing and been coughing for the last 1.5 hours and it‚Äôs keeping me up! Why doesn‚Äôt she shut her door?! 


I‚Äôm just feeling irritated. Especially as an introvert. I love my grandma to death but this is going to destroy our relationship if she stays here.
Plus she can‚Äôt anyways. It‚Äôs not going to work especially with my demanding work schedule and working from home. She would have to stay locked in the bedroom from morning until night. 

Why doesn‚Äôt she close her damn door at night tho?! She gets dressed with the door open, does everything with it open. It‚Äôs like she doesn‚Äôt want privacy. I have to keep my door closed constantly. I‚Äôm feeling enraged and don‚Äôt know how to shake it!!!!! üò°üò°üò°üò° I hate feeling this way about my grandma because of how much I love her but this situation is just not ideal. 

How can I shake this? What should I do? Her being alone here without me is make me angry too! I want her gone and out and I did tell her that. She said she would be gone before I got back home but that has changed now. Now she is waiting until I am back home. She also tried to guilt trip me really bad saying she has never said no to me in her life and allowed me as a teenager to stay there for a bit. Yes she did but she also went through my school books and personal items and read letters to my bf and then used them against me calling me a whore and my grandma can just be extremely
Mean and judgmental. She also thinks I‚Äôm too old for kids (I‚Äôm 35) but I feel young and honestly am not even ready for kids right now even if I was gonna have them but she thinks that my kids will have birth defects because of
My age. She can be horrible 

I find myself wanting to do things out of spite right now and she claims she doesn‚Äôt know how she got into this mess! She left 2 homes she could have stayed at until the renovations were done but she chose to leave because of her own anger and stubbornness! She is in this mess because of her own actions but she won‚Äôt take any accountability. 

She somehow thinks staying with me is the perfect living situation. It‚Äôs not. She only sees when I‚Äôm off work and how things are. She doesn‚Äôt know what my day to day life is truly like. ",2,1730788959.0,introvert,0,1.0,False

Hello, I hope this finds you well, that your day is well caffeinate, moving at your preferred pace, and is enjoyable. 

I was recently given one of these Starbucks Cold Brew coffee makers for my birthday, because they know I enjoy making coffee, and I ‚Äúcollect‚Äù brewers. I have never made Cold brew before, and ‚ÄúHow to Make the Best Coffee at Home‚Äù does not have a recipe. I would dearly love-as well as be eternally grateful-if you all would share your recipes, or ones that you like. The one included seemed slightly high dose/wasteful, though that may be my ignorance of Cold brew (100g/L). Also does anyone know if this brewer is able to brew a standard ‚Äúiced or hot Coffee‚Äù similar to a French press, or cold water only? Thanks for taking the time to read, and respond.

""Aren't you cold?""

""No.""

""All you're wearing is a T-shirt. You must be cold.""

""I'm not.""

It was early morning. There were no sounds of life except for the occasional car on a distant road. Even the birds slept. A breeze blew a strand of the girl's hair slightly out of her face as she stared blankly at the concrete on the porch.

""What are you most afraid of?"" the older woman asked.

""This.""

""What's 'this'?""

""The feeling I have right now.""

""Can you explain it?""

""Loneliness. I am scared to spend another moment in this feeling.""

The older woman shifted in her chair and took in the surroundings of the small apartment porch. Cigarette butts were piled in a cup that sat on top of a tiny outdoor table.

""What are you hoping for?"" the older woman asked.

""I had hoped for a different life. A life where I wasn't a failure, a life where someone loved me.""

Tears began flowing down the girl's face. The older woman stared intently at her, taking in her features.

""I feel like I could scream and no one would hear me.""

""I would hear you.""

""I feel like every face I encounter goes home to a life that offers more than mine offers me.""

""Maybe you should have some water?""

""Why is one person worth more than another? Why can some people be thrown away like a piece of garbage? Why was it okay to do that to me?""

The woman looked out into the parking lot and took a deep breath. She could see city lights between the trees in the distance, glistening as the wind blew.

""If you could go back, what would you do differently?""

""I'd leave. I'd never have gone. I'd have run out the front door and run all the way home, even if I didn't have the money to call a ride.""

""Did it change the way you viewed yourself?""

The girl thought for a moment.

""It showed me I'll never be enough. I'll always be a girl who isn't as good as the rest."" 

The girl stood up. She ran her fingers along the metal railing of the porch. Her face was splotched with red, and her shirt had long, damp trails of tears.

""I'm going to bed now.""

""If that's what you want,"" the woman said.

The girl slid open the sliding-glass door and disappeared inside. The woman sat a moment longer and listened to the silence of the night that surrounded her like a thick fog. The plastic floor-to-ceiling shades rattled with the breeze.

The woman passed through the small living room, observing the empty pill bottle atop the coffee table. She entered her former room and approached her younger self sleeping in bed. She pulled the covers up to her chest, tucking her in as a mother would. She kissed the girl's forehead and whispered softly:

""You will love and be loved. You will bring life into this world and fight for it. You will laugh again and sing and smile. You will see happiness that will touch you with a warmth you've not yet experienced. You will feel the heartbeats of your children as you softly rock them to sleep. You will love yourself for everything you have survived. He took something from you that night, but the universe will give you far more.""

The woman walked slowly out of the apartment into the hallway. As she reached the end of the hall and entered the parking lot, she passed three police officers making their way past her. Sirens rang out into the night air as the woman quietly disappeared into the darkness.",1,1730788680.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1gk0ngj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gk0ngj/my_partner_left_me_after_finding_out_i_didnt/,My partner left me after finding out I didn‚Äôt ‚Äòformally‚Äô end things with my ex before we first got together. ,"It sounds terrible when I read that in isolation but let me explain. I (29M) had been with someone (28F) who lived a distance away for several years then Covid (2020-2021) happened and we grew apart. I saw them once when Covid restrictions lifted somewhat at the end of 2021‚Äìwe met and had a coffee and caught up. I don‚Äôt know why, but I just couldn‚Äôt find the courage to formally break up. We just wasn‚Äôt a thing, we hardly spoke and didn‚Äôt see each other again in person and eventually stopped talking altogether. Enter my partner (29F) who has been in my life for years as a friend, but wanted to be friends with benefits. She knew I was with someone, but I was frank and said things weren‚Äôt going to last between us. We then slowly started to see one another casually, nothing with labels, it was largely friends with benefits. This would have been around November 2021. My partner began to feel bad about the blurred lines between the relationships, and would ask if it was over and I would say yes, because it felt like it was. 

Fast forward to 2023, me and my partner have had a lot of ups and downs. Shes ended our informal relationship several times. At one point openly said that she met someone at work she wanted to try things with and dropped me to pursue that. It fizzled out and she decided to travel instead, returning because she‚Äôd run out of cash in late 2023. We caught up and we slowly resumed where had been. Throughout this she‚Äôs always been clear that we are faithful to one another, if we want to pursue other people fine, but be open about it‚ÄîI never did want to. Now it‚Äôs 2024, we were meant to meet to have a conversation about us and the future‚Äîit felt like things might actually become serious. But 30 minutes before the meeting she messaged to say she‚Äôd contacted my ex and couldn‚Äôt believe I‚Äôd lied (presumably about not formally ending things). I‚Äôm a bit puzzled how an ex relationship that ended in what felt like 2019 has somehow ended something that has been so informal since 2021. Am I being an idiot? Is this salvageable?

1gk0mwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1gk0mwn/water_dripping_through_the_metal_filter_too_fast/,Water dripping through the metal filter too fast,"Hi there,

I bought an aeropress and love it, except for the filters. As I don‚Äôt have easy access to paper filter (need to buy them online), I bought a third-party metal filter. It has 35 microns holes and has a lot of resistance when pushing the coffee, I need to push so hard that the coffee is leaking outside of the cup. Not the kind of workout that you want in the morning.

This week, I ordered the official aeropress filter, hoping it will work great. This one has holes of 178 microns and I now have the opposite issue. All the water is going through the bed, making an under extracted mess. The time I‚ÄØstir and put the plunger to retain the water, half of the cup is already filled.

I guess I could try changing the grind size but I am buying pre-ground coffee from the store (filter coffee) and don‚Äôt have a grinder at home.

Am I missing something or am I condemned to buy paper filters? I see a lot of good reviews on the metal filter so I guess other don‚Äôt have this issue.

1gk0kwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gk0kwl/texting_anxiety/,Texting Anxiety,"So Me (M35) recently on a date with a girl which in my experience felt went great. We had very good conversation, had coffee, went for a walk and even had a pub lunch out. 
On the run up to the date, it started off with a text a day to then big essay messages we both sent to each other with space in between the evenings for replys to which she would let me know when she would get back to me or if she were busy. 
At the end of the date, I said I would like to see her again to which she said she would like to as well and I sent a message saying I had an awesome day with her and definitely liked her to which she responded positively and said she had a lovely day.
During out last correspondence, at the end I was asking her availability for the week and suggested ideas for a second date and haven't received a message back and hasn't even opened my messages for the whole day.
To which caused me to spiral and overthink cause why has she decided to not get back in touch? Mean she was pretty good on the lead up with messaging and now I don't even get a word? Like even if she had decided she doesnt want to see me, I'd prefer her saying so rather than just completely ghosting me. 
But am I just being stupid and overthinking this? Cause maybe she hasn't got back to me because well life ain't it? I dunno part of me wants to understand that her not getting back to me is fine because there could be so many variables but another part of me is like shot to shit because I'm like waiting for the rejection to happen or it has happened.

#5, I can't make healthy meals or meals in general, because my LO needs constant attention when I'm trying to do shit. I've tried to set her up with toys or even the TV, and she still ends up freaking out. So im stuck with easy stuff like snacks a lot of the time.

I tried the same with two layers of paper towel in between the poster and books to absorb the water, but the same thing happened again. I've heard of using an iron over a towel, but I'm not sure if that'd work in my case and I don't have an iron, so I'd have to get/rent one.
