 I just purchased my Aiden Precision and Ode Gen 2 (gen 2 stock burrs). I was curious if anyone had a brew recipe and grind setting with the Ode Gen 2 they have found that works best for batch brewing with Onyx Coffee Southern Weather?

1idbzpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1idbzpt/a_strange_blackout_outbreak_had_been_happening/,A Strange Blackout Outbreak Had Been Happening,"I had been experiencing recurring blackouts.

The exact starting point of this condition eluded my memory, but over time, the frequency of these blackouts had been increasing. Furthermore, each blackout seemed to last longer than the previous ones.

On a particular day, I found myself abruptly awakened in a public park, two miles away from my home, with no recollection of how I had arrived there. The last thing I could recall before blacking out was leaving an apartment, intending to cross the street and visit a nearby coffee shop.

Realizing that I needed assistance, I made the decision to consult a doctor.

I proceeded to disclose to the doctor all the details I knew about my recurrent blackouts. I shared when they first started, how they manifested, and the locations where I would find myself after regaining consciousness.

The doctor’s gaze felt oddly familiar, as if they’d heard it before.

""It's quite peculiar,"" the doctor began, looking at me intently. ""You are actually the third patient this week who has described experiencing these blackouts. What's even more surprising is that some of my colleagues in other towns have also encountered several patients with similar blackout patterns.""

""Really? How is it possible? Have they discovered any explanations yet?"" I inquired, filled with a sense of astonishment.

""No explanation has been discovered yet. However, it does seem to resemble an outbreak,"" responded the doctor. He provided me with some medication that he hoped would alleviate the symptoms and assured me that he would reach out if any explanations regarding my case emerged.

Just as I walked out of the clinic, I noticed two men standing in front of the building. One of the men struck me with a stun gun. As my consciousness faded, I glimpsed myself being tossed into an SUV.

Upon regaining consciousness, I found myself bound to a chair in what appeared to be a warehouse. Men clad in military uniforms surrounded me.

""What? Where am I? What is happening?"" I shouted, desperate for answers.

""To put it simply,” explained the apparent leader, “You are a subject in a military experiment,"" he revealed.

""It's called the 'Human Drone Project.' The objective is to utilize death row convicts, as drones controlled by our agents during missions. We injected false memories into you to prevent you from remembering your true identity and escaping. When our agent takes control of you, you experience a blackout. The purpose is to safeguard our valuable agents' lives in case the mission goes awry,"" he explained.

""The second phase we are about to expedite, involves testing whether shooting down the drone—you—will impact the lives of our agents,"" he elaborated.

""Now, do you see the soldier sitting right over there?"" he gestured toward a serviceman seated across from me, donning a VR helmet and connected to various wires.

""He will serve as the 'testing pilot,' whereas you..."" He brandished his gun and pointed it directly at my face.

""You will be the testing drone.""",1,1738204403.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

1idby76,https://i.redd.it/md35pimrl1ge1.jpeg,Otto Pizza Menu Nightmare,"Me and two of my mates came in to Otto Brookline for a night cap tonight and as usual, it never disappoints. Beer list is great, the Von Trapp Golden Lager was delicious and fresh, and I KNOW that every slice that comes out of that oven is perfectly crafted.

However, 

I can't reasonably give Otto Brookline 5/5 stars for one diabolical reason. Upon looking deeper in to the tap menu, I noticed a typo. Golden ""Larger"". 

Ok no problem - we joke about it, order a Golden Larger and *cheers*. I've worked in the industry long enough to understand that menus can change faster than my ex after a few jello shots, so a typo is forgivable.

""unicron"". There's another. You spelled ""Unicorn"" correctly in the beer name....how did you miss it in the description? Now I'm invested. Full edit mode.

Belgum. Autocorrect won't even allow me to misspell Belgium. Was this typed up on Microsoft Word 2004?

another ""larger"".....this time lowercase. Sigh.

MACACHUSETTS. Holy hell this is absurd. Another example of spelling it correctly just moments later, yet you were able to pump out a Macachusetts seemingly just to carry on this sick and twisted trend of errors.

After identifying the absurd amount of spelling errors, I was horrified to see that this was only the beginning. The menu is a grammatical nightmare.

""8 %"". Sometimes we'll put a comma next to the state initials, sometimes we'll just fogetaboutit! Should we use ""and"" or an ampersand? Let's use both in no particular order - why the hell not. ""Balance of sweet & Tart""....capital letters Have no meaning or place. Should we put a period at the end of this description? Yes, but only sometimes. Only when we feel so inclined.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I found out 10 years ago that I had some MTHFR SNPs. At that time I was experiencing severe depression, brain fog, joint pain, and intestinal distress, and among things I found to help was cutting all gluten. So I was GF but still suffering quite a bit when I discovered this, and with supplementation things got so much better that over time I ceased to identify as a person who needed to avoid bread/gluten/etc. Now I don't eat that much of it, but I do eat it sometimes. 

Anyway this winter my symptoms were back in full force. I thought maybe I was depressed because of, like, life, and age, and stuff, but then suddenly I put some pieces together and I grabbed my beloved pre-workout and Oh NO! This contains cyanocobalamin! Of course! I broke my methylation cycle again!

I got some Sam-e to help me get the wheels turning again, and now that I can like, sit down and do research again because my brain is actually functioning, I'm getting fascinated revisiting all this stuff from 10 years ago. 

My ++:

MTR A2756G   
MTRR A664A   
BHMT­02  
BHMT­08   
CBS C699T 

I notice in this round of research I'm like: oh, I had forgotten how critical it is for me to supplement D, and   
oh, I thought cyanocobalamin was poisoning me, but maybe it's actually folic acid. 

  
I remember that back in the day, early on in my depression journey, a doctor had prescribed me a form of like prescription-strength folate, and the week after I tried taking it my joints (esp knees) hurt so badly that I hobbled around. So, I did not continue, and always kind of imagined that I must already have plenty of folate. 

But maybe not! Maybe I was critically low in b12 when I tried that. So, next thing for me to try is switching from Seeking Health's Homocystex Plus to a methylfolate + cofactors supplement. 

I'm pretty sure that I need less niacin than I am getting with Homocystex, anyway. My mom once had a TERRIBLE reaction to a SINGLE niacin supplement that put her in the hospital for 36 hours. I would like less of that with my folate... but that may be superstitious -- or at least overly-cautious. Like my avoidance of methylfolate. 

Would love to discuss with anyone who wants to futz with my case. Very happy to take suggestions on how to improve my health and brain state and nutrition.   
  
For reference: I usually eat very little bread/pasta/beer etc but this winter spent a lot of time with family in the midwest due to some family stuff going on and they eat pizza, pasta, or lasagna pretty much on a loop.

To create a low-pressure dating app that connects shy, socially anxious users with extroverts who appreciate their quiet authenticity, fostering meaningful relationships through shared interests and anxiety-friendly communication tools.  

---

Key Features:

1. Icebreaker Bios:

   - Replace traditional bios with fun prompts (e.g., “My ideal date is...” or “I could talk for hours about…”).  
   - Users self-identify traits like *“shy but curious” or “extrovert who loves quiet souls.”

2. Comfort Zones:

   - Set preferred communication styles upfront: “Start with texting,” “Send voice notes first,” or “Play a game to break the ice.”

3. Gentle Nudge Mode:

   - Extroverts can send pre-written compliments (e.g., “Your music taste is awesome!”) to initiate conversations without overwhelming shy users.  

4. Gradual Unlock Chat:

   - Progress from anonymous text → voice notes → photos/video calls as mutual comfort grows.  

5. Interest-Based Groups:

   - Join communities like “Anime Lovers” or “Café Date Planners” to connect organically over hobbies.  

6. Safety & Boundaries:

   - Pop-up reminders to respect pacing (e.g., “They haven’t responded yet—give them time!”).  
   - Zero tolerance for bullying or fetishizing shyness.  

---

Monetization:

- Premium Tier: Advanced filters (e.g., “match me only with extroverts”), unlimited icebreakers, virtual “cozy date” templates.  
- In-App Purchases: Send virtual gifts (e.g., digital coffee, books) or customize avatars.  
- Partnerships: Collaborate with mental health orgs for social anxiety resources.  

---

Why It Works:

- Reframes shyness as a strength: Celebrates introversion instead of forcing users to “perform” extroversion.  
- Bridges a gap: Many extroverts crave genuine connections with shy partners but struggle to meet them on traditional apps.  
- Reduces anxiety: Features like anonymous chat and gradual unlocks empower shy users to engage at their own pace.

You're the place where people go when they want to pretend they're in a quaint little town, but really, they're just in a wealthy suburb with delusions of grandeur. 

First off, your real estate prices are so high, you'd think you were selling the moon. For what? To live next to a hedge fund manager whose idea of roughing it is forgetting to use coasters? 

And your Main Street? It's like a museum of wealth where you can buy a $5 coffee and a $500 scarf, all while pretending you're supporting ""local"" businesses that are actually just franchises with a faux-rustic touch.

Let's not forget the Greenwich accent – or should I say, the lack thereof because everyone's too busy trying to sound like they're from anywhere but here. Unless, of course, they're bragging about their summer home in the Hamptons.

Your schools? Sure, they're great if you measure education by the number of Range Rovers in the parking lot. And your ""community events""? More like networking opportunities for the next generation of Wall Street clones.

And that whole ""old money"" vibe? Oh, please. Most of your residents are just new money trying to buy into history. You can't fake class, Greenwich, no matter how many antique shops you cram into one square mile.

In the end, Greenwich, you're like that rich kid at school who thinks buying everyone's friendship means they're popular. Spoiler alert: it doesn't. You might have the green, but you're short on charm.

I have been on the carnivore diet for two months. The diet has ruined my digestive system. I can only eat meat or eggs and was having diarrhea everyday. Out of despair I started eating potatoes like twenty days ago. However, Last night I didn't eat anything, as I was going to kill myself if I had any meat or eggs and we did not have potatoes. I slept fine, woke up, went to the event for my dog, and then went to work. Within the first 30 minutes I had a normal poop, however throughout the day I needed to defecate and was surprised that the only thing coming out of me was a clear slimy discharge. It was troubling, however I figured there was nothing left in my system to create poop from. I went home and in the first hour I found the same: a clear ectoplasm was expulsed from my rectum. I ended up eating two brats for dinner and felt fine. Afterwards, my partner (23f) surprised me with a ""Rebel"" coffee ice cream. It is keto, has no sugar, and is lactose free. I figured, this is an okay thing to cheat with. It was delicious, but lacked the normal creaminess of a standard pint of ice cream. I stopped with a 1/3 left and saved it for later. I went back down to watch TV with my partner and started to feel my stomach grumble, and some gas pass. This was normal, as I just ate and previously had nothing in my system. Lo and behold I felt a violent rumble in my gut and a violent fart that resulted in two bubbles of gas escaping my anal urethra and in an out of body moment reached down to the bottom of my pants fearing the worst ...

It was wet. 
I rushed to the bathroom.  
...
...
There was only small stains. 
Thank god. 
I sat on the toilet assuming it was the clear slimy from earlier and wanted to get it all out.  
So.
With one squeeze...

I was in Panama, visiting a small coffee farm in the Boquete region, known for producing some of the best Geisha coffee in the world.

The aroma alone was unreal—like jasmine, honey, and tropical fruit all at once. The flavor? Unlike any coffee I’d ever had. Bright, tea-like, and so complex it felt like it changed with every sip. No bitterness, no harshness—just this smooth, almost otherworldly experience. It was the kind of coffee that made me stop and think, oh… so THIS is what coffee can be.

So now I’m curious—what’s the best coffee you’ve ever had? A cup so good it stuck with you, whether because of the quality, the moment, or the place you had it. I’d love to hear your stories and hopefully inspire my next travel destination!",7,1738203557.0,travel,22,0.89,False

I wished the domestic head a happy new year (as i do with all if not most connections) but when asking about the status of the application, they said they are doing the process.

I've sent HR an email but I've had no reply in 2 days.

I (f30) used to be very close to a friend for over 5 years when we were early 20s. Long story short she had very toxic traits and was a little bit jealous when I had met my now husband. The end of friendship was due to a factor of things such as her being jealous of my new relationship & her being a bit of a brat. There was no big fall out more just a disconnect and we drifted. Over the years I’ve wished her happy bday etc etc and she did the same when I get married & engaged.


It’s been around 5 years since I’ve seen her & she is now dating my husbands close friend. I did reach out to her to let her know I’m happy for her & let her know I’d be happy to organise group things with extended group. I was actually excited to hear she would be in the extended group. 

The convo is going fine and we are speaking a bit- do you think it’s normal to reconnect with people after a few years. Would it be too much to ask her to go for a coffee to reconnect or leave and let it happen naturally? I do miss our friendship and do think she’s a different person now however, don’t want to over step and say anything over the line as I did walk away from friendship.

**EXP003 R&D is live:** [**https://experimental.coffee/products/exp003**](https://experimental.coffee/products/exp003)

Some additional information: I sample roasted a bunch of green these past two weeks and moved forward with five coffees. Based on people's responses (I only have enough for 20 testers this time around) we'll move forward with one or two of the coffees and take them to production (\~20-60lb batches depending on the coffee). I decided to keep the coffees unknown to reduce some bias, so they are labeled 1-5. My ask is for you to submit a review for the five coffees, or maybe we'll make a spreadsheet (if anyone has ideas let me know). We'll then move forward with the winning coffees. If this goes well, I'll try to scale it up. Getting access to green in small amounts like this to sample roast is tricky though, but we'll see. Let me know if you have any questions.

I provided a rough cost breakdown below for the R&D samples for anyone who wanted to see the price breakdown. I'm not trying to make any money with the R&D stuff. Just having fun and experimenting to see how this goes. The list price on the site is $9.99 to compensate my time and misc. logistics to organize this because I probably missed some random cost here and there.

So, amongst my friend group, for years and years that we known each other, me and three other friends have never experienced a relationship, never bothered nor cared for it. And then, all of a sudden, the three of them have a girlfriend. And I need to tell you how much blind luck they have. 

To anyone about to say “A relationship doesn't just fall out of the sky.” or “Love is just pure luck that happened when you least expect it.”... Oh boy. Please don't start on that.

First friend, one night we were out drinking. As soon as we were gonna call it a night and head home, my friend’s friend messages him that he needs backup and support for a girl that he’s trying to hit on. Ok, so we head to the bar where he was at, find them and sit by their table. What happened was the complete opposite that night. The girl was hitting on my friend instead of her date.

They’ve been in a relationship ever since. And I was happy and glad for him. I don't remember seeing him this happy and bright in a long time.

Second friend, he’s known to never step out of the house unless somebody calls him to go out. Literally, I’m mean like the sun doesn’t see his face AT ALL. He’s either 24/7 online, or out with one of us, no third option. Then all of a sudden, a female friend of his connected him with her friend because her friend was looking for a boyfrend… And what do you know, he’s way more less spending time closed in his room and with us and is spending more time with her. At this point I’m starting to feel jealous and salty.

Third friend. For this one, a small backstory is needed.

At my college, a student’s cafe was recently opened at the time. On the first few days since it’s opening, me and my friend were sitting, chilling, waiting for the next class to start. All of a sudden, two girls approach us and sit at our table. They were waiting for their friend to come and pick them up, since they were done with their classes for the day. The four of us were talking, laughting, etc. At one point, one of them started to take a liking towards me. She complement me on how sweet and cute I am and that we should talk more. And not long after, their friend came to pick them up, they and left.

Wow. Has my turn finally come? My friend motivated me and commented that I should definitely try something tomorrow. Surely, she will come tomorrow, right? Am I right? Tomorrow comes, nothing. Next day, nothing. And the next day, nothing. Have I been talking to a ghost? I never even seen her at college, and I mean it’s impossible to miss someone considering how my college is small.

Anyway, fast forward to a few weeks later. At that cafe there is about 15 people there who are regulars everyday (me and my friend included). Everyone knows each other there, and believe it or not, every single girl there is in a relationship already.

One day, I was alone sitting at my table practicing one more time before an upcoming test. I notice a new face at the cafe, someone who’s not a regular. I’ve seen her a few times, but just doesn't spend much time there. Either takes a seat or  picks up a coffee and leaves right away. 

The next week, I wasn't able to attend college due to private reasons. And you know where this is headed… My friend and her are dating. How? All of a sudden, she approached him to play cards. Out of nowhere. At this point, I seriously want to give up.

All these three stories happened within less than 2 months. Now, almost 6 months passed, and all of them are still in a happy relationship. 




Am I really this much unlucky? They did absolutely nothing and just clicked. They just plain existed in time and space at the moment. What about me? When is luck going to start bullshiting me?

I don’t want to sound desperate, but I am going to start being desperate at this point and start seeking a relationship.

I’m tired of hearing the same old question from my parents and friends “When will you find a girlfriend?”. Oh well I don't know, why don’t YOU give me the answer that question? Because everyone keeps telling me and taught me that it will just eventually happen by itself. When will that be huh? When I’m 50 maybe? No… if I should wait for everything in life, than what's the point in doing anything? 

I’m tired if waiting, I want to start taking initiative. Because, obviously, I have no luck.

I have the looks and height. I’m confident in myself, but I’m a bit introverted. I should work on that. Any tips appreciated. And no, please don't recommend dating apps, I don't wanna feel even more miserable. 

I am in the middle of my 20s soon to be 26 and nearing 30. I just want to experience love for once damn it.

When you look back and remember the birthdays you weren't invited to, and the time your had to go to the other kid's parent to get you invited. High school was incredibly lonely; the people you hung out with at church never even spoke to you outside of organized events (I'm atheist now).  You were lonely in college, too. Only had your work friends, more people forced to tolerate your presence, until they didn't anymore. 

It was because you were a fat, ugly, audhd, monster. But even after you got ghosted and pushed away by the mirror of yourself who, on paper, should've liked you. But even they didn't want anything to do with your worthless ass. One message every two-three weeks is too much of you for anyone to have to bear.

Even after you lost weight, nothing changed. You're still the monster left over. The last choice. The one people will never message first. The one they'll have to settle for. 

There's no point if trying if no one will ever make time for you. It's better to shut yourself off to everything and everyone. If everyone you love will end up choosing someone better, or treating you like an empty coffee cup meant to be thrown away, there's no use. 

It's time to accept you'll be alone until you die. Isolated and left to stew in the pain of knowing rejection awaits everywhere you would ever go. Left to drown your sorrow and depression in video games, food, and alcohol. 

Everyone else doesn't care about you, so they must be in the right. What's the point in caring about yourself? You have no worth. You're a disgusting, piece of trash, lonely monster. Your companionship is poison and your simple presence is enough for people to run from you, even when you've only been kind to them. 

I deserve the pain and the isolation. I'm a fucking worthless germ that should die. ",1,1738203025.0,depression,0,1.0,False

Thanks for establishing a solid template for posts like this!

### TLDR

My HoLEP was completed on Monday January 27, 2025 by Dr. Amy Krambeck at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, IL. No pain other than what I’d describe as slight burning the first day when urinating post-catheter removal. I’m now urinating better and more powerfully than I have in my entire life.

### Background

I am 43 years old. My prostate was 50g with BPH symptoms for 7+ years and suspected upper bladder neck abnormalities (likely from birth) contributing to exacerbated BPH symptoms. Urocuff tests have consistently showed VERY high pressure during voiding. PVR scans were usually around 300ml (or more - over 400 a few times). Other than the prostate issues, I’m In VERY good physical shape - regular heavy resistance training, cardiovascular exercise and calculated/consistent nutrition. I spend a lot of time learning about health, nutrition and optimizing my lifestyle geared at longevity, including listening to medical podcasts that are often above my head, but they help me learn - this will come into play later in my story.

I started BPH treatment with Doxazosin around 4 years ago. This medication made me very dizzy and did not do much for my BPH symptoms. I stayed on Doxazosin for a few months, but only saw mild improvement in terms of BPH symptoms, though the dizzines did subside after two weeks. It wasn’t good enough, so I requested we try a different medication. My urologist switched my medication to Tamsulson (Flomax). Tamsulosin noticeably improved my BPH symptoms, but still not enough to be happy in my day to day life. I still woke up 2-4-times a night to urinate, starting urine flow was difficult 8-9 out of 10 times and always felt like I had more ""left in the tank"" when I was done urinating.

It was at this time that I started asking my urologist about surgical options for BPH. He suggested a Urolift, which he “specializes” in. He didn’t mention HoLEP, TURP or any of the other procedures. His practice doesn’t have anyone trained in HoLEP, and only one of the more tenured urologists there was trained in TURP. My urologist also recommended holding off on any procedures until my wife and I were done having children, so we left things there since (at the time) my wife and I were undecided on whether or not we wanted a second child. Symptoms weren't great, but they were tolerable, so I left things in that state for another couple years.

During one of my yearly follow-up appointments I mentioned that I felt the Tamsulosin wasn’t helping me as much as it had been. My urologist decided we could try doubling the dosage of Tamsulosin. I agreed. Upping the dose seemed to help a little bit, though not quite the improvement I’d seen compared with the initial improvement of one pill vs. no treatment.

### Making the decision

Shortly after making the jump to the double dose of Tamsulosin, my wife and I traveled out of town to attend a wedding. On the eve of the wedding we attended a cocktail hour. I should state here that I don’t drink at all - I’ve just never enjoyed the way it makes me feel, but I have recreationally used marijuana for years. I never felt the same loss of control with marijuana that everyone expriences with alcohol. One of our friends brought some marijuana to the cocktail hour, so we went outside to smoke a little bit. After returning back inside I quickly started to feel a wave of “if I don’t sit down, I’m going to fall down.” So I sat down, but it didn’t help…

The next thing I know there are 20 faces hovering over me. I had fainted in the chair and fell backward, but luckly the person who had been there to catch me was a nurse. She instincively started firing tons of questions at me trying to assess how “out of it” I was - “what’s your name, what year is it, where are you,” etc… Cut to: an ambulance comes and they hook me up to an EKG, tell me my heart is very healthy, I decline a trip to the hospital and they send me on my way.

That night I spent some time on Dr. Google and came to find out that Tamsulosin, and alpha blockers in general, have a mild to moderate interaction with marijuana. They can cause light headedness, fainting and other symptoms of that nature. This actually wasn’t the first time I’d felt light headed when combining the two, but with just the normal dose of Tamsulosin (one pill) and some recreational marijuana the worst I’d experienced before then was a “I stood up too quick” feeling and not full-on fainting. I didn't put it together that it was the Tamsulosin interacting with marijuana at that time.

That night was the single most embarrassing moment of my life. I decided then and there that I had to get to the  bottom of whatever was going on and actually fix it.

Once I got home, I decided that it was time to find a new doctor. The combination of the medication not helping much, his lack of modern procedure options and his aversion to some other treatments made it feel like the right time to move on.

Through some contacts in the medical field, I was able to find a MUCH better fit in terms of urologist: he presented me with a lot of treatment options, lowered my dose of Tamsulosin back to 1 pill and added in low dose Tadalifil at 5mg. This combination made a notable difference, bringing my difficulty in starting urination from 8-9 out of 10 times to more like 5 out of 10 times. Still no improvement in overnight wake-ups to “go,” but a notable improvement during the daytime hours.

I hadn’t put it together at the time, but a podcast I listened to late in 2023 had a very important (for my future) guest: Dr. Ted Schaeffer, Chair of Urology at Northwestern Medical. The topic of the podcast: everything related to prostate health. It was during this podcast that I first heard the name Dr. Amy Krambeck and heard about the HoLEP procedure. I didn’t think it applied to me at the time, as it sounded quite intense, but it left an impression. Here’s a link if you’re interested: [\#273 ‒ Prostate health: common problems, cancer prevention, screening, treatment, and more | Ted Schaeffer, M.D., Ph.D.](https://peterattiamd.com/tedschaeffer2/)

After meeting with my new urologist, I revisited the podcast episode and took notes. I began reading more about Dr. Krambeck, the HoLEP procedure, Dr. Krambeck’s training and involvement in the field of urology and even her involvement in working with the companies that develop the holmium laser technology used in HoLEP procedures.f

I waited a few more months, but my wife and discussed things and we decided that we were done having kids. Side note: having a HoLEP doesn't mean you can't have kids anymore, it just means they'll likely have to extract semen through alternate means due to retrograde ejaculation. 

It finally felt like _now_ was the right time to schedule my procedure and I decided the HoLEP was what I wanted due to its durability and success rate. I consulted with my new urologist and Dr. Krambeck, ultimately making the decision to travel to Chicago for my procedure. Dr. Krambeck and the team at Northwestern Medical truly stood out in terms of professionalism, polish and my mind kept going back to “if I have access to someone widely considered to be one of the best, if not THE best, at this procedure, why would I consider anyone else?”

### Pre-Procedure Process

I was traveling from out of state to Chicago for this procedure, but I imagine they have everyone complete these steps:

* About one week prior to the procedure I had to submit a urine culture test to ensure there were no abnormal bacteria present in my urine. In my case there were none, but if there had been they would have prescribed some antibiotics to begin a week or two prior to surgery.
* I needed relatively up to date bloodwork to submit to them, including PSA - my PSA has never been high and bloodwork two weeks out from surgery returned a PSA value of 0.3
* Seven days prior I had to begin a daily prescription stool softener regimen - they want absolutely no pushing to get anything out post surgery, so you start the stool softener before and continue a full week post-surgery.
* A call from an intake nurse roughly one week prior to the surgery to cover all current medications, current weight, height and some other general information. They provide feecback on which medications are ok to continue taking, and when to halt anything that might conflict with general anesthetic leading into procedure day.
* The last business day prior to my procedure (this past Friday) they called to give the time of the procedure, reminded me to not eat after midnight, and to drink only water, black coffee and/or tea the morning of the procedure.

### Procedure Day

I was the first appointment of the day, so I had to be at the hospital at 5:30am, with a scheduled start time of about 7:40.

I badged-in downstairs, made my way up to the 5th floor to check in and waited for my case number to be called. It all progressed smoothly and swiftly.

Once I was taken back to the pre-op room, I was instructed to change into my gown and then met with a gauntlet of nurses, Dr. Krambeck’s Fellowship student (Dr. Patel), the anesthesiologist, and Dr. Krambeck herself.  I was then taken back to the operating room and things really progressed quickly after that. I remember putting on an oxygen mask and them telling me they’d give me the aneasthetic soon.

The next thing I know, I’m waking up in the recovery room.

The procedure had been estimated to take about 1 hour, but based on the texts my wife got it took 39 minutes. I spent more time in recovery coming-to from the general anesthetic than I did in the OR.

After some time (maybe 1-2 hours) reviving in post-op, I was wheeled back to my recovery room where I’d spend the night. It’s worth noting here that, most of the time, they often release pateients the same day. However, I chose to come to Chicago on my own so my wife wouldn’t have to take off from work, and we wouldn’t have to take our daughter out of school for a few days. If you’ve gone under general anesthetic they will not release you from the hospital the same day without someone there to escort you.

When I got to my room, they had me stand up and walk down the hall just to make sure the anaesthetic had fully cleared my system and that I could balance, walk and talk without issue. I passed that test just fine.

Next up was the first pee. They filled my bladder with enough fluid to give me a relatively urgent “need to go” situation, and removed my catheter. I stood up and proceeded to have the most powerful urination of my life. It felt as though I might pee through the bottom of the container I was “going” in… The end result:

* 700cc of water in
* 800cc out
* 162 PVR

I had two more post surgery voiding tests, and things only got better. I did not have fluid injected in my bladder for the second or third test, but just regular water consumption and voiding into single-use urine containers where they measure output and then ultrasound for PVR.

Test two:

* 700cc out
* 200 PVR

Test three:

* 500cc out
* 82 PVR

My urine was the color of slightly watered down KoolAid in those first three voids, which they said was expected and were very pleased with - calling it “perfect.” I did have some stinging in my urethra during each void, and asked if they could give me medication for it, as my fourth void was a bit higher in PVR just from the discomfort causing me to hold back. They gave me a Phenazopyridine, which is the medication that turns your urine orange - it made a HUGE difference in that sharp/burning feeling, almost completely eliminating that sensation. My next void was back in the low 100’s PVR. They stopped measuring PVR after that - I’d passed all the tests as far as they were concerned.

By the next morning my subsequent urination color was completely normal - with a faint orange tint from the one dose of Phenazopyridine the day before. No more KoolAid color at all.

That morning, I met with Dr. Krambeck, who said the surgery went wonderfully and that my prostate “came apart very nicely.” I’ll be hearing from pathology in a week or two after they check the tissue that was removed for any traces of cancer, but barring any issues there…

### Conclusion

I could not be happier. I almost cried the first time I peed after the surgery. Not from any pain (there was none except the slight burning), but after years of dealing with issues, fainting in public, and finally following through with the surgery… it was a lot, and I felt pretty emotional once I realized that I was finally on the other side of it all.

Post-surgery instructions are as follows:

* 5 sets of 5 kegel holds (for 5 seconds each “rep”) every day to strengthen and maintain pelvic floor muscles and function.
* Week 1: rest and do as little activity as possible. Walking is ok, but slow and steady - nothing that would be considered exercise. Do not lift anything greater than 10lbs. More specifically, do not lift anything that causes a core contraction that would cause you to brace your abdomen. I asked for clarification here, because the backpack I brought to the hospital was certainly more than ten pounds, but they assured me it wouldn’t be a problem since it’s on my back and not perceivably heavy.
* Week 2: Limit activity, including exercise - do half of what you’d normally do. I asked more specifics here because I lift weights a lot and even half of what I normally do could still be considered more than what other people’s 100% would be. They said to feel it out, but in my case maybe limit to 1/4 of normal activity because of my normal heavy resistance training.
* Week 3: OK to resume sexual activity. Also allowed to return to regular activities as I’m able. With the additional note to limit strenuous activities such as biking (and similar activities) for a total of 4 weeks from surgery day. The following were not in the written instructions, but I’ve added them for additional information  based on questions I asked. These mostly pertain to folks who participate in heavy resistance training and to highlight when resuming biking (and similar) activities is permitted.
* Week 4: Ok to increase activity intensity.
* Week 5: Ok to resume biking 	(and similar activities).
* Week 6: Likely able to go full-intensity with resistance training. But listen to my body and don’t push it if not ready.

Currently nearing the end of the second day since my HoLEP. Bleeding is barely there - I’m wearing pads/liners and I notice a few spots overnight and during the day, but they’re very minor. Urine color has returned to normal, and the during/post urine burning sensation has subsided without additional doses of Phenazopyridine today. I’ve been walking around the area nearby for food, moving slowly and have had no issues getting in roughly 5,000 slow-moving steps each day. I’m flying home tomorrow evening.

Next steps are a follow-up in three months with a PSA re-check to be done prior to that appointment. They mentioned that since the core of the prostate has been removed, the post HoLEP PSA value to watch for is now anythng above 1.

I wanted to get my initial thoughts out while everything was still fresh, and I'll update this thread with anything that comes up if/when it does.

I hope my story and experience helps anyone on the fence about seeking treatment. I’m happy to answer any questions folks may have, whether in DM or in-thread here.

Hey everyone!

It’s my first year at Sierra College, and I’m still getting used to everything here. I’d love to meet some new people and make friends along the way! I’m an international student taking ESL classes, so I’m always looking for ways to practice my English—but mostly, I just want to have fun conversations and meet interesting people.

A bit about me—I love reading (always open to book recommendations), baking (but not cookies!), and anything creative. I enjoy making things look nice, whether it’s decorating, crafting, or trying out something new. I can be pretty straightforward, but I really appreciate kind and genuine people. It takes me a little time to open up, but once I do, I’m always up for a good chat.

I haven’t made any friends here yet, so I figured I’d put myself out there! If you’re at Sierra College and want to grab coffee, study together, or just talk about random things, hit me up. 

College is always better with good company—so don’t be shy, send me a message about yourself 😸",1,1738202775.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1idbbv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyloss/comments/1idbbv8/a_letter_to_my_daughter/,A Letter to My Daughter,"Dear Serafina,

The day I met you was the best and worst day of my life. You were already gone when they placed you in my arms, swaddled in pink, with a white hat covering the dark brown hair you got from me and your dad. That was the first time we met, and the last time I ever saw you, melded into one horrible nightmare come true. 

I found out I was pregnant with you on Father’s Day last year. I could barely wait more than 15 minutes after missing my period to pee on that stupid stick. I had a feeling you were in there, and that feeling turned into the faintest pink line a few minutes later. It was at that very moment, the few seconds I took before screaming for your dad, that I fell utterly in love with you.

Of course, your dad was in the bathroom with a camera less than a minute later. We hugged and kissed and gushed over that pink line, and your dad snapped photos of the first moments we ever came to know you. We called your grandparents, and I couldn’t resist texting Aunt Jamie that what I thought was my period a few days earlier was in fact just implantation bleeding, the only time I would ever bleed the entire pregnancy, until the night you were born. 

We were at the doctor a few weeks later. I was seven weeks pregnant and you were just a peanut on the ultrasound. I remember how filled to the brim your dad and I were with nervous excitement as we stared at you, wildly perplexed that there was a tiny human inside of me. The doctor told us not to worry, but said I had a subchorionic hematoma. When I asked about it, I learned it could lead to a miscarriage. My heart leaped and sunk in the same beat. 

Eventually the hematoma went away, around 15 weeks. By now, you were making me throw up almost every morning. I finally had to tell my boss I was pregnant so she’d cut me some slack on missing my morning meetings. I posed in the mirror every morning, waiting for the sight of the slightest bump. I couldn’t wait to meet the peanut (that I now knew was a little girl) that was wreaking havoc on my digestive system.

Your dad and I fantasized about traveling the world with you. We imagined you at Yankee games, funneling cotton candy into your mouth. Anytime we saw another baby in a carrier at our favorite coffee shop, we nudged each other and said “that’ll be us with Serafina”. Eventually, we told everyone and they all started buying you gifts - onesies and pacifiers and crinkly sounding toys. Your closet was stuffed with dozens of pink outfits, lovingly picked out by your Grandma Linda.

Our 20-week appointment was the first time we’d go to the hospital, the same hospital we’d find ourselves at twice a week as you grew bigger. We saw your hands and your toes and your button nose on the ultrasound screen, and crossed our fingers that they wouldn’t find anything wrong. We must’ve not crossed them hard enough, because the doctor came in only to tell us you weren’t growing and we’d probably never get to meet you.

Your dad and I sobbed for days. We held each other up with the little strength we had left and began the onslaught of appointments and second opinions that would never end, even after your death.

Every two weeks, they’d scan you again. You’d grow just enough to grant us another appointment, but never enough to grant us relief. You weren’t growing as you should and you had too much fluid in your brain. We sent you for as many tests as we could, but none of them told us anything. As far as we knew, you were just a little lady with a big personality. 

It was around that time you started kicking me every day. At first it felt like someone was rubbing spoons along the inside of my stomach. As you got bigger, it turned into kicks and punches and full body rolls, and you always got the hiccups. You moved so much, I started to worry less. I never counted kicks because I didn’t need to. Anytime we went in for an ultrasound, they’d call you an “active baby” and tell us how much you were squirming around in there. You’d never make it easy for them to get the pictures they needed. My defiant daughter, antsy from the start, just like her mom. 

Eventually, you stabilized. You made it to the third trimester and your dad and I began to set up your nursery. Your kicks were big enough for your dad to feel (his favorite nightly activity), and once I found out you could recognize my voice, I started talking to you every day. You quickly became my best friend and confidant. I was absolutely dying to meet you. 

By the time 32 weeks rolled around, we were going to the hospital twice a week for NSTs and dopplers. You were being so carefully monitored, I’d never fathomed the possibility that you wouldn’t make it, especially not mere hours after we were just given the green light after an NST to take you home and come back next week.

I was just shy of being 35 weeks pregnant the night you were born. As you got bigger, you started to kick the ligaments by my hips, and I became more and more uncomfortable. Like many women in their third trimester, I couldn’t sleep through the discomfort, so I decided to watch TV in your dad’s office. Within minutes, my legs were covered in blood. I screamed for your dad with a blood clot the size of a small steak in my hand. It felt like it took forever, but eventually the paramedics whisked me away in an ambulance while your dad sped off in our Subaru close behind. 

You didn’t make it to the hospital. You passed sometime when I was tossing and turning in bed, trying to ignore the pain that I would later learn were contractions after my placenta completely separated from my uterus. The little kicks you gave me when I first laid down were the last I’d ever feel. 

Just that afternoon, we were at the hospital for your NST. You were fine and we were sent home with no need for extra monitoring (a true pregnancy miracle). Less than 12 hours later, you were gone.

The doctor gave me some medicine to help me “sleep” through the c-section. I couldn’t bear the thought of watching you be pulled out of me only to never hear you cry. Your dad waited for me in the recovery room, because I wanted to preserve his memory of you. Once I came out of the sedated haze they put me in, they handed you to us, swaddled in pink, the most beautiful human being I have ever seen. 

We kissed your cheeks and forehead and soaked your swaddle with our tears. You couldn’t have looked more perfect, even though you could’ve fit your whole body in your dad’s hands. Eventually, they took you away. We told you we loved you and I apologized until I was blue in the face. You needed me and I failed you. My body was a terrible home.

I still have stitches from where they cut you out of me, a scar that will forever remind me of the mother I never got to be. They will heal, and so will I, but my life will forever be missing an integral piece - my sweet baby girl, my beautiful daughter, my little best friend who I so longed to meet.

You survived just long enough so I could know you, but you left the world too quick. One of the nurses who took care of me after the c-section said you were one of the babies that was born too perfect for this earth. You were destined to skip this life and become an angel, forever watching over me and your dad.

I’ll beat myself up forever, wondering if I could’ve saved you. Maybe if I woke your dad up sooner. Maybe if one of my frantic Google searches led me to placental abruption symptoms. Maybe if I would’ve decided not to power through the pain and go to the hospital at the first twinges. Maybe then you’d be in my arms, latched to my breast, living a life of love with me and your dad. Know that I tried. I took every vitamin, went to every appointment. I checked my blood pressure, pricked my fingers four times a day, and always slept on my left side. I took lukewarm showers and stopped dyeing my hair and didn’t even look at sushi when I carried you. It was the greatest joy of my life. I would sacrifice anything, including myself, just to save you baby. I need you to know, I really really tried.

Until we meet again, I will forever long to feel your kicks. I love you my sweet Serafina.

Getting decants honestly is where it’s at so you can see how each fragrance wears and how it meshes with your body chemistry. There are some that I’m happy I only got the decant and others I moved on to buy the full size. I wish I would have started with Reddit before I started really getting into perfume, it would have saved me a lot of money and made a whole lot more sense to start with a decant 🤣

I’ve struggled with mental health on and off since I was a teen but i’ve been quite good for a while now, but I recently feel I am stuck between a rock and a hard place in regards to my job, I left my previous job as it just became very repetitive day in and day out, but the hours were good I left that job as a new opportunity had arisen for me, (I was previously a Supervisor at a global coffee chain, I now work in a restaurant) so both in the hospitality industry. 

I haven’t been at this new job long but today I cried on the phone to my mom, it’s unlike me to cry, so for me to cry over a job is a real eye opener to me of how unhappy I truly am within this job. 
My life isn’t all doom and gloom I have a very good and healthy relationship and a house with my partner but as of recently I’ve started to glorify (TW) suicide as I don’t feel like I am meant to be here anymore i’ve had attempts before but i’ve always said I am meant to be here for a reason but I now feel like my time is up.

I don’t get to spend quality time with my partner due to conflicting schedules as they have a 9-5 but there are days that I don’t start until 4PM and finish at 10/11PM so I don’t get to see them much and their off days are completely different to mine so we barely see each other much despite living together.. 

I don’t really have much going for me as I didn’t go to university so I don’t have the qualifications for a desired job, I don’t do much with my off days due to being burnt out from working, and it’s again becoming very very repetitive, as someone who is also neurodivergent a routine is a good thing for me but I cannot take much more of this life it’s grinding me down and making me so miserable that I feel the only way to fix anything now is to take my own life to end this cycle of being stuck in a job that I again despise, I know it seems very silly of me to think of taking my own life due to something minor as a job, but I feel like my life is going to be a vicious cycle of job hopping and being stuck in jobs that make me miserable and make me feel this way. 

I know I’m young and I have my whole life ahead of me but I do genuinely feel as if I would be better off dead I don’t like this job, I don’t like this life, I don’t want to be stuck in a job that I fucking despise going to but can’t leave as I can’t afford to, I live pay check to pay check I have no savings so I can’t even think of leaving and focusing on myself for a while before finding some place else. 

I’d appreciate any support or guidance in regards to this as I probably am not alone when it comes to this, and if you’ve made it this far thank you for reading. ",1,1738202298.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

2 years ago I bought a 100% wool rug for 500$. It is light coloured, low-medium pile with some texture. It’s a cream coloured rug. After getting a dog, it is absolutely trashed!

Does anyone have a recommendation for a large living room rug around 8x10 that is nice and modern looking, but can really withstand daily traffic and… life? We aren’t precious with our home, but I do like it to look and actually be clean and homey!

Bringing in a couple of new players and needed a way to provide a cast list (big NPC list - 60ish active characters) and some basic setting info to the new players.

Well, being the weirdo that I am, I decided to do this as an in-game journal written by one of the NPCs who was doing some plotting. Contains:

* hand written entries (in different handwriting / medium) from 5 characters for nearly the full cast
* a fold out map (of the campus its set on and the city its set in)
* fake polaroid's, some of which have been photo manipulated to insert clues
* library index cards
* bar matches for non-existent bars, custom stickers
* coffee stains
* cigarette burns
* fake newspaper articles
* a fake milk carton

Pretty proud of it overall. Will post additional photos once it gets unveiled to my players (in case any of them are lurking here) if anyone is interested.

“Alright, everyone, it’s time for ‘On This Day 10 Years Ago,’” our editor announced, kicking off our Monday meeting.

This was our weekly ritual: revisiting notable events from a decade prior and assigning stories. A niche concept, but people loved digging up the past, especially the dark stuff. Think of us as a “Whatever Happened To…” for those obsessed with reliving human misery.

December 21 – Winter Solstice – gave us plenty of material: darkness, survival, winter madness (The Shining, anyone?), and other morbid tales. After a rundown, we claimed our pieces.

“Jimmy, you’re on the \[Redacted\] Junior High Band Fire,’” Roger assigned.

I grimaced. “Can I hear the other options? Reporting on grieving families and band-aides isn’t my vibe today.”

“Too late,” Roger shot back. “Besides, you’ve got all year. Nothing says Christmas like Krampus.”

“Krampus is overdone.”

“You’re not the editor,” Roger said, dismissing the argument with a belly-cupping lean.

I spent the morning researching—refreshing myself on the band story and tumbling into the eerie rabbit hole of Krampus folklore. Later, I packed up to attend my daughter Erica’s holiday band concert.

The event was classic: dressed-up kids, proud families, and squeaky renditions of festive songs. With winter break officially underway, I promised my wife, Rowan, and Erica I’d take a week off work. I mostly stuck to it, though reading up on Krampus didn’t feel entirely like cheating.

By January 1, I was ready to dive back in.

\*\*\*\*\*

The \[Redacted\]  Junior High Band Disaster occurred on December 21, 2014, in \[Redacted\] , \[Redacted\] , a town known for its location between the North Pole and equator, music festivals, and a devastating fire at the school. The fire during a band concert claimed 56 students, 110 family members, and 8 staff members, trapping them inside an auditorium where the doors locked automatically. Despite footage being removed from the school’s website, it still exists online.

The band's last song, “Krampus Comes to Christmas,” included eerie narration before things went horribly wrong. Survivors’ accounts are unclear, but one person, Kel, the sound guy, filmed the disaster. His footage reportedly shows a giant flaming ball and Krampus appearing, followed by chaos and screams. Kel, now in a psychiatric hospital, accidentally knocked the camera, capturing only screams and a dark scene.

The official story was that faulty doors and an electrical fire caused the tragedy. Since then, the school’s band program has been canceled, and the auditorium remains untouched. I’m now heading to \[Redacted\]  to investigate further, with a list of two people to speak to: Shelly \[Redacted\] , the band director’s widow and Liesel \[Redacted\] , the principal. There are a few more randoms I might be able to meet – not too many, but a few people responded to the Facebook Post we put out looking for leads.

\*\*\*

The North Woods in the winter are bleak. It is dark for much of the day – the sun usually doesn’t rise until 8:00, and it begins to set around 4:00. It’s also cold – the cold that drives people in – either to their homes or to bars. Snow blankets the ground and the buildings, and won’t melt until March. This insular quality can be charming if you’re up there for something like snowshoeing or cross country skiing. But, when you’re turning up stories about a mass child casualty, it can seal you like a tomb.

I got into town after the long drive, much of which was on two-lane country roads. I settled into my room in the town motel, and took the front desk clerk’s advice to have dinner at \[Redacted\]  – the local bar and grill. The building creaked, as the wind battered the old windows; ice was building inside the rooms. I’ll tell you, the entire time I was there, I don’t think I took off my coat. Obviously, I was an outsider. 

While this town had its share of visitors during the summer months and in the wake of the tragedy, my outsider vibe stood out like a banner. In a back booth, I sipped my Spotted Cow, and dug into my burger, while I read over some notes. 

“You busy?” a gruff voice asked from behind.

I looked up to see a middle aged man, full beard, a lot of camo, standing at my table with three other men, who could be related, or could have just adopted the same \[Redacted\]  winter look. 

“No, not really,” I said quickly. “What’s up?”

“We heard you’re hear to talk about what happened at \[Redacted\] . That Krampus stuff.”

He said it as a statement – which was slightly accusatory. 

“Well, yeah. I got assigned the story for my job. I wanted to see it, and talk to a few people.”

“No one’s left, you know. That wiped out our kids – most of our friends. Anyone who did live, we drove away. Don’t put your nose where it doesn’t belong, you read me? We let those others leave because they’re one of ours. I don’t think we’d treat you so kindly, if you catch my drift.”

With that, they strode away, and returned to their seats at the bar, turning back frequently, for effect – or to see if what they said was enough to make me leave. 

It was. I quickly finished, left some money on the table, and returned to my room. When i got to my door, I saw a piece of paper folded into the door jamb. I took it, and quickly brought it inside, double latching the door behind me. Taking a breath, I opened it. It was a faded postcard. A grotesque creature with horns and chains loomed over a terrified child. “Season’s Beatings!” it read. Beneath the cheap humor, the image stirred an unease I couldn’t shake. Probably those guys – punctuating the message.

I learned that Shelly and Liesel no longer lived in \[Redacted\] , likely because they weren’t welcome after the fire. My plan to get reactions from the townsfolk was now off the table. Instead, I'd visit the site the next day for photos, then head north to find Shelly and Liesel. 

That night, I barely slept, worried the men from the bar might come after me. The wind howled against the window, and the sound of a loose shutter kept waking me, making me think they were at my door.  My mind also kept drifting to Krampus. The terrifying images of him—half-goat, half-demon, leading a procession with flaming torches, chains, bells, and a bundle of birch branches—haunted me. The unsettling sound of his bells and the thought of the sack he used for capturing misbehaving children made the nightmares worse.

\*\*\*\*\*

Groggy, I woke up, thankful for surviving the night. It was early yet, no later than 6. I stopped at a gas station, got some coffee, and headed to the site of the junior high. The building stood – the area where the auditorium had been was changed into a memorial. Though it was still dark out, the memorial was lit brightly. All the names of the children, towns members, and staff were listed – except for Director Karl \[Redacted\] . This was intentional, I found out. As I stood, taking pictures, I heard a light clicking behind me. I paused and listened, and heard the clicking magnified. Afraid I had been founded, I turned quickly.

Behind me, a herd of deer had gathered, their glassy eyes fixed on me. They stood motionless, save for the occasional flick of an ear. My breath caught—the stillness wasn’t natural. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a snippet of folklore surfaced: animals sense what humans can’t. Suddenly, they all began to slowly shake their heads, left and right. Motionless, I watched. I heeded their warning, and moved towards my car, avoiding the herd. As I drove away, they continued to watch me, in disdain, as I headed into the darkness. 

On the way, I had to see more than 40 deer. Many were mangy, fur coming off in patches. I couldn’t drive more than 40 miles an hour, straining my eyes as I watched the sides of the road. Each one did the same thing – shaking it’s head, as if telling me this was not a good idea. I was already 7 hours from home, and I was close, I could feel it. I’d talk to Shelly. Find a place to stay, head up to Liesel’s and see if I could at least get a “No Comment” in person. And, then I’d drive the 9 hours home and be done with this. 

\*\*\*\*\*

Shelly had returned my emails. As the widow of the band director, she had lost her husband in the fire – and should have been there. Her son was sick, so she stayed home with him, viewing the concert on TV. Shelly was well-liked – she was a secretary at the elementary school, and had grown up in \[Redacted\] . Some expressed their sympathies – it wasn’t her fault. But most expressed a persistent, persuasive controlled isolation that gave her the message she was no longer welcome in town. Her parents had died in the fire – they had gone to the Christmas Concert for as long as she could remember. With no one left but David, she moved an hour North, changed her last name, and took a job at the Walmart.

She had settled in \[Redacted\] , \[Redacted\] . The name was fitting as I worked my way through the narrow main road. Snow removal was a creative endeavor in small towns like this – mounds of white were pushed in the center of the road, and filled large parking lots, creating mountains among the squat building. Shelly’s home was on a side street, and I parked somewhat in the middle of the road. I had not seen another car the whole way up from \[Redacted\] , and there were no cars out this morning, either. Shelly was waiting by the window, expectantly, as I walked up, and met me at the door. 

“Quick, come in,” she said, pulling the door shut behind her. “Don’t want to let the cold air in,” she said nervously, taking my jacket.

The home was warm, and cozy. It smelled of soup and coffee. We sat in the front room, and Shelly wrapped in a crocheted blanket. She recounted, slowly, the evening. At first we focused on her – I always find you get to the story once you get them talking about themselves. We talked about her guilt – for not being there, and the way the townspeople treated her like she had a contagious disease, causing her and David to move up North. David, for his part, no longer a small child, but now an adult, passed in and out. He had on headphones – the large kind, and didn’t acknowledge our presence. 

“I think he’s had a mental break. Noises bother him – any noise. He wasn’t really like that before his dad died. I did keep the house very quiet after this happened. No music, no TV. I didn’t want to see the news, and any music reminded me of Karl. So, we lived in silence. I think it shocked Davey’s system – he went from a house full of instruments and singing and dancing – to silence.”

Her recollection of the events were similar to what Kel’s video had shown. According to her, the lines read – mixed in to be narrated over the band, which played discordant chords, were written to summon the beast himself. It had been a rumor, among the music community. Something like this had happened before at the first performance. Only, in that case, the group performing were in a sound studio. But, that space had also caught on fire, and the doors to the studio showed marks from where the musicians had tried to claw their way out before they burned alive, being found in pugilistic posture with a clenched position due to the contraction of muscles in the heat. Karl had heard this – but, when he found the piece, he was convinced it wasn’t true. And, he reasoned, if it was, Liesel would have told him no.

In all my research, I had not heard of this case. I questioned her on this.

“They changed the name. It had gotten a little press in \[Redacted\] , I think. But, they just changed the name – not the words, not the song.”

She looked down, and I saw a teardrop on her folded hands.

“We ruined a town. We killed them. And, now I’ve ruined my son. We ruined Christmas.”

“No, no. These things happen. Really – look, I write about stuff like this all the time. There’s always a logical explanation – which doesn’t make it better. But, it’s not his fault.”

She looked up, her face suddenly changed. Her appearance looked angry, her mouth drawn.

“I know it’s not. It’s Ms. \[Redacted\] . If she hadn’t approved this song – had just said something, it never would have been chosen. She had the authority. It was her job. And, she told him to play it.”

“So what you’re saying is, Karl had to have his music approved? And, Liesel, gave him the greenlight.”

“Yes – it was her. She was the evil one. She’s the one who told him to try something new. She’s the one who gave him the idea to check out the warehouse. Do you know this music was over 75 years old? It had been stored for a reason. But, since she got out – she goes on. And, no one cares.”

This was interesting. I hadn’t heard anything about Liesel, other than the fact that she had escaped. It made more sense about how she had reacted to my requests. There wasn’t much more to talk about, and I timed it out so I could make the couple hour drive during daylight to Lake \[Redacted\] . I thanked her. 

As I made my way to the door, she handed me an envelope. 

“Just open this when you get where you’re going.” I nodded.

Getting back into my car, I turned on the defrost. The heat I generated on the way up had left a sheen of ice on the interior of my car. Opening the envelope – she couldn’t see me anyway in this ice box, I found the narrator’s lines for the Krampus song. According to her account – as soon as the final line was read, the fire began. How these words ever made it into a middle school band concert are beyond me:

In the cold of winter's grip, A shadow stirs with frosty lip, Hooves that echo, chains that clink, Krampus comes with eyes that blink.

Fur like night and horns like stone, He moves through towns where lights have grown, A whistle sharp, a chilling sound, A monstrous figure, creeping 'round.

With a sack to carry children’s cries, He steals away beneath dark skies. The bell’s harsh jingle rings the doom, As flames rise high in endless gloom.

He knows the weak, he knows the sin, And haunts the hearts that dwell within. A cruel laugh splits the silent air, For Krampus seeks those who despair.

Beware the night, the cold and fear, When Krampus’ steps draw ever near. No prayer will save, no door will lock, His cold embrace the final shock.

In neat script, Shelly (I assume) had written:

*These are the words that were read;  I don’t believe any copies remain. You need to see the words, you need to understand that this is what brought Krampus. If they’re uttered aloud, he comes. Please do not print, and please destroy.* 

So, these words were read – and the town ended up dead. It was chilling. I imagined the kids – screaming, as the fire spread. The parents, trying to find their children, and having these words be the last thing they heard – aside from the anguished screams engulfed in smoke and flames. I looked up – and my windshield was clear. I put my car in reverse, and stopped immediately – flagged by the back up detector. 

Looking through my rearview mirror – I caught the reflection of a buck. Its horns stretched outward, it had to be a 14-point buck. He stood there, steam emanating from his nostrils. Like all the deer before him, he slowly shook his head. Again. I kind of waved my acknowledgement, and went as quickly as I could to the main road to take me out of \[Redacted\] , and on to \[Redacted\] .

\*\*\*\*\*

Liesel had been a little less forthcoming in our discussions. Liesel was also at the concert – she had left before the final song, checking her cell phone. She too had a sick one at home – her other two boys, though, were in band. The babysitter had called, asking if Nate could have some ice cream – he had made a miraculous recovery – and while explaining no in five different ways, she heard the doors click behind her, and then the screams. When interviewed about it, she had tired to get it – reports indicate she actually scratched into the heavy wood doors with her nails in an attempt to pry them open. Liesel had left town not long after the fire; she resigned, and headed even farther north, to Lake \[Redacted\] , with Nate. They too took new names. She was not willing to do an interview – but, I can be pretty convincing. And, the benefit of sparsely populated places – you can find people pretty easily.



\[Redacted\]  was almost in \[Redacted\] . On the most northern point of the state, it was even colder, and even more bleak. There was no motel in \[Redacted\]  – in fact, it was not even a true town, and from what I had gathered, Liesel didn’t live in town. I made my way into \[Redacted\] , found a room, and quickly got fast food. I didn’t want to run into locals. I didn’t want to see more deer. The same thing that had happened on the way to Winterland happened on the way here. Deer – everywhere. In various forms of decay, lined the road. Each of them stared at my approach and passing, their black eyes fixed, their heads shaking slowly.

The night proved uneventful – aside from the banging of the wind, and the dreams of Krampus. I awoke, and lay in bed, lulled by the sound of the radiator blasting heat. Getting up to make coffee, I pulled aside the heavy curtain to see if it was yet light. I took a step back when I saw a shadowy, horned figure etched into the frost on the window, resembling Krampus. It wasn’t a simple condensation pattern or a natural frost formation; it was deliberate, almost as though someone—or something—had crafted it overnight. The room felt small, as this image only reiterated what I was feeling – I had been marked. This eerie omen was left, as if the creature had marked me for some unknown purpose. I felt as if I was being watched, trapped in a cycle I couldn’t escape. I went outside, felt the blast of the below zero temperatures, and tried to scape off the ice from the window. Then, I quickly packed up my room, got dressed, and headed to a local diner for breakfast.

I scanned the room again, my eyes darting to the door every few minutes, and then focused on my coffee. When the waitress came back to refill my cup, I decided she seemed harmless enough.

“Hey,” I began, keeping my tone casual. “You wouldn’t happen to know a woman around here with a son—he’d be about 18 now. Moved up this way maybe ten years ago?”

She tilted her head, giving me a curious look. “Hmm… you mean Lila? Why? What’s going on? She in some kind of trouble?”

“Oh, no, nothing like that,” I said quickly, forcing a laugh. “I’m just an old friend. We were supposed to catch up while I was passing through, but I misplaced her address. And her number, too, somehow.” I added a sheepish shrug for good measure.

The waitress seemed to relax, her suspicion melting into mild interest. “If it’s who I’m thinking of, she’s out by \[Redacted\]  Creek. Not much out there but trees and a couple of houses. She’s kind of… different, you know? Keeps to herself. Her son’s a hell of an athlete, though. I think he’s headed to college in \[Redacted\]  next year. I saw something about it in the paper.”

“That’s gotta be her,” I said, nodding as if I were relieved. “Weird Lila. Yeah, that’s what we used to call her,” I added with a chuckle, trying to sell the lie.

The waitress didn’t seem to notice anything off and went back to tidying up behind the counter, clearly satisfied with the exchange. Just another stranger in a town happy to gossip about someone on the fringe.

When my food came, I thanked her, ate about half of it, and left some cash on the table. My stomach churned as I walked to the car, though I couldn’t tell if it was from the food or something else entirely.

I pulled up \[Redacted\]  Creek on my GPS and started east, trying to shake the uneasy feeling that settled over me. I didn’t like this place, didn’t like how it made my skin crawl, but I had to find Lila—or at least say I tried. Then, maybe, I could leave this town behind for good and get back to \[Redacted\] .

\*\*\*\*\*

The drive, as all had been, was desolate. The landscape was white – the ground, the road, the trees – the sky had even taken on the quality of blankness. The only contrast were the dark shape of deer, spotted every so often along the road. Only, now they appeared more sinister. I know they were deer. But they looked different – larger, with larger horns. Their faces took on the look of something sinister. Their eyes blacker. I avoided their gaze and kept my head straight until I hit a road that ran along the river. 

The water churned, dark and brown. The road had one single set of tire marks in it, and I followed those, hoping this was the clue I needed. It was. About a quarter mile up, I saw a Baycliff High School Banner, with the last name Nilsen, and the first name Nathan. I would bet this one was them. And, the tracks I had been following went right to this home. Smoke billowed from the chimney of a small, river stone home. I parked in the drive, and opened my door. The blast of the cold stopped me momentarily. 

As I walked to the front door, I saw movement in the window, just the flutter of a curtain. Before I reached the front door, it opened quickly. 

“Well, you are certainly persistent,” said a small woman, with gray hair and large glasses. 

Though I was at least a foot taller than her, she was intimidating, even in a purple sweatsuit. This was her – I could tell she was a principal by her stance and the way she seemed to look right into my consciousness.

“Liesel?” I asked. 

“Yes, unfortunately. You might as well come in – no sense standing in the cold, and letting all my heat out. Take off your boots.”

I did as I was told, and entered the home. 

I would love to tell you I got to the bottom of this. And, that there was a rational explanation for everything. That wasn’t the case. As we sat down, we began to talk about her time in Cordova over coffee. Nate wasn’t home; he was working in \[Redacted\]  at the \[Redacted\] . He was going to \[Redacted\]  on an athletic scholarship, and Liesel planned on following down there. Winter wasn’t the same, Christmas had been ruined. It was pretty much the same feeling Shelly had shared. Liesel lost her two sons that day, and she and Nathan had decided to not celebrate the holiday anymore. Liesel’s husband had left her, taking his own life a few years after, addled by alcohol and grief. 

“There’s not much left to tell. It was awful. It was the worst day of my life. There have been days I wish we were all in there together, and there were days I wished I never made the older two play an instrument. But, you can’t ask questions. You’ll find answers you didn’t need to know.”

“I do have one more question, if you don’t mind,” I said, pulling the envelope out of my coat pocket. “I saw Shelly. She gave me something. A poem, it looks like…”

Liesel shot up immediately, and in one swift movement, grabbed me by the arm, pulling me out of the seat.

“Get out!” she said, picking up my boots. She opened the door and threw them outside. 

“Get out!” she said again – louder this time. She looked into the treeline, back and forth, her eyes filled in terror. “Why would you bring that! That lady wanted you to summon them. She has never accepted she wasn’t the only one who lost anything. We all lost. A part of all of us died that day. But this – she won’t let it stop. If you’ve read it – even to yourself, you’ve summoned it. Get out, and don’t come back. Don’t even take that out again.”

With that, I stood there, shocked. I too looked around, as the door bolts click, click, clicked. 

What had I done? What did Shelly do to me?

\*\*\*\*\*

I drove back to \[Redacted\]  as quickly as I could. The trip was a blur. I kept my eyes on the road, and didn’t reach home until midnight. Somewhere, on a lone stretch of highway, I had taken the envelope and threw it out the window. The words, harmless, probably, made me paranoid. Having them on me, or even near me, was too much. My only hope was they’d be picked up by a snowplow, and gone forever.

Back in town, I was anxious to get this written and out of my hands. At this point, I was hoping I wouldn’t be on staff by the time this was published. None of this felt right, and I didn’t want to be associated with the story I was about to write. Once done, I’d put out my feelers and find a position writing about prep sports or something.

Roger loved the story – of course, sick bastard. It had just enough mystery. I didn’t include anything about the poem, and I embellished a bit. The final printed article suggested that Liesel admitted the doors were done in a shoddy way; it was the doors. The fire had been due to a malfunctioning sound system they were aiming to replace. 

Krampus did not cause this. Krampus’s words were not to blame. Now, if only I could convince myself of this, I would be fine. It wasn’t that easy though. Each month, something would happen, taking me back to those three days up North. Deer, stopping and judging. Krampus images showing up out of season. Banners across internet pages, where his sinister smile would seemingly eat me alive.

August 2025

I did end up finding that other job. Jimmy \[Redacted\]  was now the beat reporter for local sports in the \[Redacted\]  area – and, I couldn’t be happier. Very little drama – aside from the sidelined hero dealing with a torn ACL. I could handle that. The hours were better too, and there was no travel – which meant no deer.

I finished early, one afternoon, and let Rowen know I would pick up Erica. She had started a new year, and I was eager to get a little more one on one time with her. I watched her come out and make her way to my car after leaving her friends. 

“How was the day,” I asked, easing out of the pickup line, glancing at her, smiling.

“Really, really good. Guess what?” I loved when Erica was this animated. I was so fortunate to have such an amazing kid – it got me thinking about \[Redacted\] , and all those families. All that tragedy. I thought of Shelly, alone with Davey in \[Redacted\]  – a perpetual winter for them. I wondered what Liesel was doing, and if Nate made it to \[Redacted\] . I was lucky. 

“What?” I asked, keeping my eyes on the road.

She continued,  “We already picked Christmas music for the concert – and, we’re doing this really, really weird piece. Mr. Brown said it’s not even published anymore – something about some tragedy. Anyway, he found an old copy in the music room. It’s about this guy – his name is Krampus. Have you heard of him? Anyway, he’s super weird and is the opposite of Santa – so he like, beats you if you’re bad. Anyway, it’s called “Krampus Comes to Christmas” and I get to be the reader – I read all this really dark stuff about him coming for all of us. Isn’t that cool? I am already counting down to Christmas…”

1idb2hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiForSmallBusiness/comments/1idb2hj/i_asked_chat_gpt_why_deepseek_was_better_heres/,I asked Chat GPT why DeepSeek was better. Here’s what it said...,"I was curious about all the buzz around DeepSeek so I decided to give it a shot and see how it stacks up against ChatGPT. So I ran a simple test.

I've been using GPT for a while now and know how to tweak its settings, GPTs and Agents to get better results. 

But this time, I wanted to keep things simple. So I gave giving both models minimal context and seeing how they perform side by side.

But, before we dive into the results, here’s what ChatGPT had to say about DeepSeek.



Response: *DeepSeek, a Chinese AI model, has garnered attention for several reasons that some consider advantages over ChatGPT:*



1. ***Cost Efficiency****: DeepSeek was developed with a budget of approximately $5.6 million, significantly lower than the investments made in models like ChatGPT. This cost-effectiveness is achieved by utilizing less powerful hardware and optimized training processes. citeturn0news12*
2. ***Open-Source Accessibility****: Unlike many proprietary models, DeepSeek is open-source, allowing developers and researchers to access, modify, and build upon its code. This openness fosters collaboration and innovation within the AI community. citeturn0news10*
3. ***Energy Efficiency****: DeepSeek's optimized architecture delivers 20–30% better energy efficiency than ChatGPT, making it more sustainable. citeturn0search6*
4. ***Technical Proficiency****: In evaluations, DeepSeek has demonstrated strong capabilities in solving complex mathematical problems, coding tasks, and providing detailed analyses, often outperforming ChatGPT in these specific areas. citeturn0news8*



*However, it's important to note that DeepSeek implements stringent guardrails to comply with Chinese government requirements, resulting in blocked responses for politically sensitive topics. Additionally, while DeepSeek excels in technical tasks, ChatGPT consistently provides more comprehensive answers and maintains response integrity, making it preferred for unbiased and straightforward queries. citeturn0news8*

*In summary, DeepSeek's advantages in cost, accessibility, and technical proficiency make it a compelling alternative to ChatGPT, particularly for users focused on technical applications and those seeking an open-source solution.*

Honestly, looking at it objectively, DeepSeek not only came up with more ideas but also covered most of what ChatGPT suggested. 

DeepSeek’s also provided more examples to support their recommended strategy

OK, but before you hit me with the ***“Cool story, bro”*** and scroll away, hear me out, this actually matters.

No AI tool can *completely* take over your marketing (yet), but the right ones can get you *damn close*. 

I’m talking 70% of the way there. 

Especially when it comes to refining your messaging, generating ideas, and speeding up execution.

Think of AI as your brainstorming partner; one that never sleeps, never gets stuck, and never runs out of fresh angles. 

If you’re not using these tools *now*, your competition will. And when they do, they’ll outpace you, out-test you, and outsell you.

So stop waiting. Start learning. The game is changing, and the only question is, ***are you keeping up?***

A few hours later, the partner comes to my side of the office to fetch the lawyer-in-training to sit in on something he's doing. The manager laughs and asks in an annoying sing song voice like he's in kindergarten, ""Did youuuuuuu break the printer?"" He jokingly blames someone else and they all have a great laugh and crazy office manager reassures him she fixed it. I was livid. I had to leave the building and walk around the block. No apology, no acknowledgement, and she's all smiles and sunshine with the partner. I wanted to cry out of pure frustration. And while the partner can be tactless and rude (especially when he's overwhelmed,) I hate that she treats him like he's mentally deficient.

I am looking elsewhere, but I'm at the point where I just want to go in tomorrow and pack my shit up and never look back. I'm sure I'll get 'just talk to her!"" but she always has an excuse and will turn it back on me or else just give me fish eyes. I have never, ever worked with such an abusive manager and such weird people in my life and I worked retail as an adult (you haven't lived until you get cursed out over an espresso machine over the phone.)

1idasyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/canceledpod/comments/1idasyv/brookes_pr_observations_state_of_the_pod/,Brooke's PR + observations + state of the pod,"Based on what I've observed in this sub, on Tiktok, and on the Cancelled Pod/Brooke's youtube, I think Brooke needs to pick up some of this advice (or other PR advice) or she might get nudged out of Cancelled, especially after that Crazy Days & Nights blind item hinting to such.

**Strat Foundation**

* **Brooke needs to solidify her brand.** Prior to her controversy, Brooke's brand image was emerging as very clean-girl, sorority girl, calm, peaceful. She was seen as the balance in Cancelled, opposite Tana's party girl past; Tana is Las Vegas - colorful, extroverted, outspoken, varied, and exploratory; Brooke is Tucson - chill, outdoorsy, laid-back, down-to-earth. Additionally, she was more relatable and ""girl-next-door"" - going to a large public university (UofA), struggles with her mom, desiring a relationship, talking about a flop ex (Clinton Kane), doing pilates, being very online, loving horses...she was very ""American Girl"", recording Cancelled in her mini-uggs, 818 Tequila matching sweatsuit, and slick-back buns. Personally, things that I consistently associated with Brooke was **self-tanner, pilates, Western fashion, cats, and  minimal elegance (both in her personal style in clothing/hair/jewelry/home interior).** Unfortunately, I also associate **pick-me energy** and **evasiveness,** especially since she now does not stand for anything in order to appeal to everyone and to avoid further controversy. Going forward, Brooke needs to be more confident on the pod and more calculated in what she posts, as this informs audience's associations with her. My recommendation is: consistent DITL vlogs doing pilates, trying new hairstyles or healthy recipes, making coffee, volunteering at cat shelters and donating supplies they might need, hikes at Runyon, and avoiding public crashouts on Tiktok (Brooke could even take the angle that she now is journaling those thoughts instead of on-a-whim posting rants online, and this will actually focus the topics she then brings on the pod and refine her opinions on drama or personal experiences, ie no longer talking out of her ass). Brand deals that could come from this are: meal-kit companies, workout set/pilates gear, hair products, stationary, cat food, etc. Furthermore, self-awareness at her impulsivity and anxiety over her public perception could be used to collaborate with a stationary company for a specific journaling kit (stickers, journal, pen, prompts on pages), or with a wellness company regarding mental health...something along these lines. Learn who you are, and then market yourself to brands and audiences as that. Right now, you do not have any unique or favorable traits, and you're shooting yourself in the foot.
* **Address the tweets.** She really hasn't. My recommendation is to write out all of your feelings toward your political influences growing up, towards the political climate surrounding your community as a child, and how this informed your decision to tweet such nasty things. Could you have said such things without adult influence and an ignorance-bubble surrounding you for all your life? Are you mature about accepting autonomy over saying such things while addressing how you have come to recognize how vile it is? Following this, film an intimate, sit-down style vlog or podcast episode discussing these things. You may feel that you are damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't, but it is important to discuss what happened in a mature manner and to take ownership of it. Audiences have to know that you want to actually say, ""I did this and I apologize"" with action. **There are audiences who have been alienated by what you have said who have chose to no longer support you, and rightfully so**. **You have to address the tweets not because you want to ""buy back"" fans, but because you want to take responsibility for your previous thoughts and actions in a mature way, even if it was influenced by ignorance**. This, I feel, is the only way forward, and Trisha even said this. You've had much time to reflect on how it went down and how you fucked up a response to it, so own it, and mean it. Acquire a backbone.
* **WORK. ON. CANCELLED.** Cancelled should be your bread and butter, especially now. Patreon inconsistency is not helping your public image, or Tana's for that matter (though audiences have come to accept Tana's tardiness and scamming lol), and so a schedule is very important. Moreover, come to set prepared - read about topics so you are informed, come with ""receipts"", and stand on business about your standpoint on topics. We don't necessarily want political commentary, but if you bare-minimum discuss news topics, at least know about key points. Again, acquire a backbone.
* **Dump Miles.** Audiences know you are a slave to male validation...which is true to who you are, at least based on what you present to them. Dump Miles. He's not the first man in Hollywood to be a groomer, but you dating him after your controversy is NOT helping your image, or how audiences understand your integrity and morals after your tweets resurfaced. Are you really willing to put your credibility and brand on the line for a man? STAND UP...and, from a PR perspective, have a girlboss arc or something. ""Brooke Has Been Freed from Male Validation"", ""Brooke On How Pick-Me-ism Ruined Her Life"", ""Brooke On Her Collection of Flop Boyfriends"". If you take a girlboss angle, show it through making Cancelled and vlogs a priority, throwing yourself into work, and into female friendship. Brooke Feminism arc...lol. If you don't do some personal introspection about your people pleasing, low self-esteem, fear of failure, competition with other women, and pick-me-ism, you are sabotaging your brand to the point of no return... and for a MAN...STAND. UP. You need humility, and to reflect on what you did in the past, and your creep boyfriend and why you stand by him.
* **Stand for something.** Donate to and volunteer at cat shelters. Create a scholarship for girls/women who want to go into nursing. Give back to communities in Arizona, your roots. Talk about being the child of an addict. **Being vapid and entitled to a spot in the public eye, having a predatory boyfriend, and evading all responsibility for your controversy communicates to audiences that you are narcissistic and entitled to your public image**. Be genuine, and care about something outside of yourself, men, and being hot. People dislike LA influencers for those reasons. If you want to be different from the LA influencers and create a personal brand that identifies with that difference, and if you want longevity in the influencer space, **you have to be genuine**. Take a step back and reflect on how you got here and what made you, and give back to things central to your life and lived experiences.
* **Post on Youtube about things other than Wildfox hauls.** It's disingenuine and audiences are intelligent. They know how the industry works, and they know you are only posting this sponsored content to hold up your end of the contract. Audiences that stuck around care about you, and want to see you, and they want to know who Brooke is. They don't stay subscribed to only see Wildfox hauls.
* **Content with Tana outside of Canceled.** Audiences can kinda pick up on a shift between Brooke & Tana. Many people have suggested that one pod ep be an open and honest discussion about their friendship and how it's changed over the course of Cancelled, tour, and controversies. I think your audience would enjoy that, and again, it would contribute to your authenticity.
* **No more bootlicking for the rich & powerful in your industry.** Self-explanatory. LA is a vapid meritocracy - but aren't you already well-connected with Tana? There's no point in social climbing if your work doesn't land with audiences anymore because of a lack of authenticity. If you lose Tana, you lose everything, so you need to carve out your own career and niche. It's important to create a foundation for yourself, all through the above points. The bootlicking reeks of desperation, which your audience associates with your incessant need for male validation and your tendency to play Devil's advocate on the pod.
* **Self-growth and meaningful content around it.** Along the lines of the previous points, content surrounding your personal growth will contribute positively to your personal brand and career. Will you finish your degree and place an importance on education for women? Will you begin to be vulnerable and share stories about your life through story-style videos? You need to find a content niche, and, following a video or pod addressing your tweets, dumping your boyfriend, and becoming more charitable, self-growth and fulfillment may be the way to go. Of course, if you are actually content to self-sabotage with your relationship and entitlement to your influence, then just ignore this point.

This is all that I have to say. Really hope that she stalks the sub and sees this, because if she does not make a pivot soon and stop self-sabotaging, her career is over. All she'll have is a closet full of Wildfox Couture and Miles...if that doesn't scare you, Brooke, then you must really hate yourself.

TLDR for the employed or short-attention spanned: I dislike Brooke and analyzing how she's killing her career since the tweets and how entitled she's been about it.",4,1738201064.0,canceledpod,8,0.63,False

That would make it 6d or above, that's what I'm talking about. And if you think your ability just applies to anyone reguardless of how high they scale then that's just flat out a limitless fallacy. 

The downplay comes at the parts where you talk about dbz characters being ""off guard"". If they're in a fight it won't happen, plain and simple. Plus you misconstrued what ultra instinct is, acting like all it amounts to is quicker reaction time, which it's not. Whis stepped in the poop because it wasn't a threat, not because ultra instinct didn't detect it. It is literally fighting without thinking, tons of guides and the show and manga itself say this over and over.

You also tried to argue against the dbz hax negation by saying roshi was x strong and his opponent was y strong with absolutely no evidence for either, just assumptions. Goku holds back in literally every fight in super atleast once, there's no reason to assume the characters roshi mafubaed were on his level, plus with the absolute insanity that is super scaling, who knows maybe roshi is multiversal. I mean goku did mention he got stronger durring his fight with him afterall.

With goku breaking out of hits ability, jiern ""surpassing time""(which was reiterated in guides several times, he did in fact surpass time, and vegito ignoring the fact that his dna was literal coffee candy. There is absolutely no reason to think yahwach's almighty wouldn't end the same way.

Plus, yhwach needs a reality in which he wins to even us almighty, who's to say there would even be one. I know that's what your argument over ""guard down"" dbz characters was, but like I said when the fight starts that doesn't happen. And keep in mind almighty always uses futures from after the point of activation not the past, so as long as gokus aware the fight started then it's possible that it flat out wouldn't work reguardless of all of this.",1,1738201041.0,u_Tully64,0,1.0,False

First, I asked ChatGPT to tell me what themes fair foundation shade names fit into, and two of the themes were:

1. Natural Elements (Delicate & Ethereal References) - Inspired by naturally occurring materials and soft imagery.

Examples: Ivory, Alabaster, Porcelain, Pearl, Snow, Frost


2. Luxurious & Refined (Classic & Elegant) - Names that evoke sophistication and prestige.

Examples: Shell, Silk, Lace, Cream, Cashmere

Then I asked it to generate some names for darker shades with the same themes. At first it just gave a bunch of food items, but after being prompted again, it generated:

Natural Elements (Ethereal, Earthy, and Celestial Inspired)

Obsidian Veil, Obsidian, Bronzed Horizon, Ember Twilight, Ember, Sienna Aurora, Sienna, Terracotta Eclipse, Umber Storm, Umber, Golden Eos, Sepia Solstice, Sepia, Duskstone, Dusk, Sable Moon, Sable, Horizon, Terra, Eclipse, Solstice.

Luxurious & Refined (Fine Materials, Soft Textures, and Prestige Inspired)

Velvet Onyx, Velour, Gilded Terra, Gilded, Satin Ember, Bronzed Silk, Ebon Mirage, Mirage, Sable Cashmere, Sable, Midnight Suede, Suede, Regal Sepia, Regal, Lustrous Umber, Imperial Dune, Lustre, Eos, Nocturne.

1idapct,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1idapct/25th_passenger/,25th passenger,"I used to work the night shift as a train operator for the city’s subway. The graveyard shift was always eerie—empty stations, flickering lights, and the occasional late-night wanderer stumbling aboard. But nothing compared to what happened on November 12th, 2022.

That night, I was on the 3:15 AM route. As I pulled into the last underground station before the train looped back, I counted the passengers through the rearview mirror. There were exactly 24 of them. I always counted; it was a habit I developed for safety reasons.

The doors closed, and I continued the route. A few minutes later, I glanced at the mirror again. There were now 25 passengers.

I frowned, thinking I had miscounted. Maybe someone had been obscured by a seat. But the number gnawed at me. I decided to do another count at the next stop. As the train pulled in and I watched people exit, I counted again. There should have been fewer now.

Still 25.

A chill ran down my spine. My stomach twisted. I turned in my seat and scanned the car through the small operator’s window. The passengers sat in silence, some staring at their phones, some dozing off. But something felt… wrong.

At the next station, a few more people exited. I counted again.

Still 25.

My throat went dry. I checked the security cameras, rewinding to see if someone had somehow reboarded. Nothing. My hands gripped the controls tighter as I continued through the tunnel. The air felt heavy, suffocating.

I had to see for myself.

At the next station, I made an excuse over the intercom—""Routine check, everyone remain seated."" I stepped out of the operator’s booth and walked through the train, my eyes darting from face to face.

There were only 24 people. My heart pounded. I swore I had seen 25 in the mirror. I shook it off, chalking it up to exhaustion, and returned to my seat.

But as the train plunged into the darkness of the tunnel, I glanced at the mirror one last time.

There it was.

The 25th passenger.

It sat in the very last row, face obscured in the dim light. My breath hitched. My hands trembled over the controls. My instincts screamed at me to stop the train, to get out, to run—but I couldn’t. I had a job to do.

The next stop was the final one before the turnaround. I kept my eyes on the mirror. The figure never moved. As the train came to a stop, I held my breath, waiting for people to exit.

One by one, they stepped off. And as the last of them disappeared into the night, I counted again.

I shut the doors and bolted to the back of the train, my heart hammering in my chest.

The seat was empty.

But there was something left behind—a single, damp handprint on the window, smeared as if someone had been staring out, waiting for something… or someone.

I never worked the night shift again.

But the story didn’t end there.

A few weeks later, I ran into an old colleague at a coffee shop. He still worked nights. We chatted for a while before he hesitated and leaned in. ""Have you ever noticed something… strange on your shift?"" he asked.

My stomach dropped. ""What do you mean?""

He stirred his coffee, glancing around as if making sure no one was listening. ""A passenger. One that doesn’t belong.""

I felt the blood drain from my face. ""You’ve seen them too?""

He nodded slowly. ""Not just me. A few of us. Same thing every time. The count is off, then it isn’t. Like they were never there. But someone always finds a mark. A handprint, a shadow in the reflection—something.""

I swallowed hard. ""Who is it?""

He exhaled sharply, looking me dead in the eyes. ""No one knows. But rumor has it… it started after a passenger disappeared on a train late one night, years ago. The conductor swore he never saw anyone get off. But they found a single, damp handprint on the glass.""

I shivered.

That night, I dreamed of the 25th passenger. In the dream, they were sitting in the last row, staring directly at me. But this time, I could see their face.

And they were smiling.

The next morning, I woke up to a notification on my phone. It was a security alert from my old train station. A motion sensor had been triggered in an empty subway car.

I tapped the video feed open. The footage showed a train sitting in the dark, abandoned on the tracks.

Then, for just a moment, the lights flickered. And in the reflection of the train’s window, I saw it.

The 25th passenger.

**dining room table**\-everyone's table is the same except panam's which has a map of the southwest NUSA, pill bottle, baggie of drugs with a couple pills, books, coffee cup, documents, and a paperweight.

**living room table**\- all have magazines and one empty champagne glass

panam- nothing

kerry- radio, lots of beer (spilled), 3 hard alc bottles and 2 shots, 2 full champagne glasses, one ashtray, 4 baggies of drugs, plastic cups

kerry has an extra pillow, 2 guitars (one acoustic) and an amp nearby. not sure if they put this much thought into which guitar to place, but the electric one is the same asset from the psychofan gig and i think, the 2013 flashback

river- one champagne glass, bottle, and champagne bucket

judy- 2 hard alc bottles and 4 shots, 2 rocks glasses, 2 ashtrays, 2 spunky monkey cans, pizza and pizza boxes, 2 packets of something-cigs?

in front of it, judy is the only one who has a record on the player, and it's a samurai one. there's also a box of records. there's a blanket, a hookah, another full champagne glass, pack of cigs, ashtray, and 2 baggies of drugs. 

i'm gonna assume judy having 3 ashtrays in the living room means her smoking habit is back in full force because of her unhappiness staying in NC. also the drug baggie assets here are the only ones that look different from the rest, the ones on panam and kerry's tables are all the same one. not necessarily important, just a note.

**kitchen**\- everyone's kitchen counter is clear except river's which is covered in various cooking stuff. you can see the stovetop is damaged from use too.

Unlike most people who experience anxiety, I never get anxious over an issue or event. I am an avid rock climber, I have never gotten anxious 30 feet off the ground. I’ve gotten into a car crash, no anxiety. Even as an introverted person I don’t get social anxiety or experience anxiety while speaking in front of a crowd. 

However sometimes when I’m just living life I experience anxiety out of nowhere. My heart starts going and I get a feeling of fear or doom. Eventually this feeling goes away on its own or I take a moment to gather myself mentally but until them I am out of it. Is this a serious issue? 

I do consume caffeine but no more than 1 beverage a day (ie one coffee in the morning, or 1 redbull before a workout), and I will still get anxious on days I don’t consume any. I’ve (thankfully) never experienced anything traumatizing nor have suffered any long term abuse.

(Many) details below:

About the place:  
\-Two bedroom, two bath (one bathroom is in my room, the other, which would be yours, is just off the living room)  
\-2nd floor walk up  
\-Room for rent has a sun-room attached which could be used as an office or extra storage (the sun-room is not climate controlled)  
\-In-unit washer and dryer  
\-Spacious kitchen with a lot of storage  
\-Tons of light!  
\-No parking, but street parking is rarely an issue  
\-$900 utilities included; $900 deposit  
\-Month to month; with 30 days notice of vacancy  
\-The whole unit is sparingly furnished, as most of my furniture is in another state; if you have furniture you’d like to use, great!  
\-I CANNOT EXPRESS ENOUGH HOW NICE IT IS LIVING IN DEMUN! Coffee, ice cream, restaurants, parks all within a few blocks.  
\-Available ASAP

About me:  
\-I’m 40 yo single woman  
\-I am fun, chill, communicative, and don’t believe in passive-aggressive post it notes. I won’t take discussions about the space personally and would like to find a roommate who is the same way.  
\-I’m very friendly and a people person and will probably make you laugh.  
\-I have a chihuahua who will ignore you unless you have food to offer him.  
\-I’m studying to become a licensed therapist and counselor and I do work from home a lot, BUT I spend a lot of time in California for school/work/family.  
\-I’d love to have a roommate I can catch up with at the end of a day and maybe watch a movie with on the weekends, but I also spend a lot of time alone.  
\-LGBTQIA friendly/affirming and this will be a safe space for BIPOC–if any of this makes you uncomfortable, then we won’t be good roommates.  
\-I don’t drink, but I don't mind having alcohol in the house as long as there are no ragers.  
\-I have a background in intercultural competency/international education, so this would be a friendly space for international students from Wash U.

About you:  
\-Will run a credit check and would prefer references–this is my home, not just a rental, so finding people who respect the space and the neighbors is extremely important.  
\-No pets (I love animals, but my dog does not).  
\-Ideally a Wash U graduate student, medical resident, or working professional  
\-Is okay with the fact that at the end of this coming summer I may be moving back to CA, which would mean looking for another roommate to take over my room if/when that happens.

The most important thing to me is making sure we will be compatible roommates; we live in a very isolating time, so having someone I connect with on more than just a roommate level would be really nice.

I know 100% that I'm not because it started since I believe 2016, ever since a family member passed away. I started passing out randomly, no one knows why.

My aunt once said, I didn't pass out right so I must be faking. I wasn't, I just saw lights and I just passed out, I just remember I felt anxiety. I can't remember any other details because that was years ago.

I remember passing out at different jobs once, luckily I wasn't doing anything dangerous like carrying something heavy or operation like a pallet jack.

One time when I passed out at one of my old jobs my BP was I remember was 200? And my HR was high too it went on and off high and low.

I know if I'm too anxious at times I can pass out, I don't know why. If I stand up too fast I get dizzy, but I don't know why. They tried to do a ""pots"" or whatever test but they didn't do it right.

I got diagnosed with having Syncope but they said that I must be faking that too.

But...I get dizzy as heck if I stand up too fast. I get outta breathe when I walk up a flight of stairs and I don't know why, when I'm running I get out of breath too (sure I'm not used to exercising but whenever I tried getting into it I got exhausted if I tried running more than 3-5 mins).

If I'm angry (like sereve emotions) I even feel exhausted and dizzy.

Am I just making this all up in my head? Should I get this checked out?

Even caffeine at times (like three cups of coffee) can make me feel dizzy at times.

No one is taking me seriously.

I remember passing out in high school randomly as heck and scared my class and friends. It took me awhile to even regain my consciousness. I'm not sure if I had a concussion or not though because that was awhile ago.

Sometimes after I pass out, my memory is funky. Sometimes before I pass out I don't have pass out symptoms (at times) but I get dizzy and headache like.

I don't always pass out but it doesn't always happen, but if I'm sitting down or laying down I'm probably preventing it so maybe that's why? I don't know.

I just think I'm overreacting, but maybe I'm not.


- Current medical issues: Anemic
- Current undiagnosed medical issues: Tics (possibly Tourette's or FND)
- Past medications that I remember: Vyvanse (Lisdexamfetamine) Note: I forget what else, because that was awhile ago. 
- Weight: 125 lbs (fluctuating; bc I'm not eating healthy like I was)
- Height: 5'3""
- Undiagnosed mental health issues: so far anxiety and depression (they labeled me as bipolar after a psychiatrist in a mental hospital saw me for 5 minutes and I told them no symptoms about bipolar and told them nothing about having bipolar only about having anxiety here and there and PPD that's it)

- Things to note: I'm caffeine sensitive (possibly? don't know, but I can't even have more than 2 cups of coffee anymore, I'm lucky enough to have 3 some days. Decaf is good at times too.) In the past I struggled with an eating disorder and I still do. I have ADHD and I don't know what else I have. 

• More things to note: I have migraines. I had a placental abruption (if that's important at all). Used to smoke (cigs) way in the past.

Female, 41, 135lbs, 300mg ivig taken monthly through port for hypogammaglobulinemia. 

At the gas station this afternoon with my coffee and snacks I tripped over my shoelace, my coffee went flying, covered everything in a 6 foot radius, and landed directly on my knee.  It was straight out of a comedic movie and I’m positive they are still laughing and rewatching the surveillance footage.  Lol.  

Anyway, aside from my ego being bruised so is my knee.  I suspect the bruise looks worse than it is. I can walk on it with difficulty and a limp and it pops with every step.  

I’m currently icing and elevating popping Ibprofin and really don’t have time tomorrow to get it checked out, and its probably fine- but a few years ago I dropped equipment on my hand and thought that too, but you all told me it was likely broken, and it was, in several places and I had a cast for 7 weeks to my elbow so I figure - why not check with you before I try to skip the urgent care tomorrow. 

Pic of the knee the bruising and swelling keeps getting worse. The injury occurred at 12pm and it’s currently 5pm- so 5 hours ago.  

So anyway - do you think I need to get this checked out? Anything else I should do other than ice rest elevate and keep popping Ibprofin? Anything else I need to look out for? 

You all are the best.  Sorry for the gross knee pic lol

1ida7wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/smosh/comments/1ida7wv/spork_hero_of_smosh_a_fan_fic_about_angelas_dog/,"Spork, Hero of SMOSH! A fan fic about Angela's dog Spork.","Okay, okay, listen up, because I, Spork, am about to tell you a tale. And not just any tail – a *tale*, understand? Like, epic. Though, admittedly, my tail is pretty darn cute, all wild and swishy when I’m excited. Which is, like, always, especially when Angela’s around.

Angela. She’s my *MOM*, the center of the universe, the peanut butter to my jelly. She’s got this laugh that sounds like wind chimes in a summer breeze, and her hair is always kind of a joyful mess, and she smells like sunshine and whatever delicious lotion she’s using that day. And she *gets* me. She understands that when I bark at the mailman, it’s not aggression, it’s *vigilance*. I’m protecting our domain, people! She knows that when I nudge her hand with my nose, it’s because I require head scratches, stat. Most importantly, she knows that my tongue, which often curls out the left side of my mouth like a tiny, pink flag waving hello to the world, is my most charming feature. I’ve seen her take pictures of it. She *knows*.

So, picture this: we’re in our apartment. Comfy couch, sunbeams slicing through the blinds, the scent of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the kitchen (Angela’s coffee, not mine. Coffee makes me…jumpy). I’m nestled on Angela’s lap, naturally, and getting premium ear scratches. The TV is murmuring some show about baking, but frankly, I’m more interested in the crumbs lingering on Angela’s t-shirt. Life is good. Life is perfect. Life is… about to get a whole lot more exciting!

Suddenly, Angela’s phone buzzes. She answers it, putting it on speaker because she’s learned that I object vehemently to anything dividing her attention from me for too long. “Amanda? Hey! What’s up?” she says, her voice all cheerful and sunny.

And then, Amanda’s voice comes through the phone, and it’s… not sunny. It’s… warbly. Panicked, even. “Angela! Oh my god, Angela, you’re the only one who can help me!”

My ears perk up. Help? Angela? Is there danger? Is someone threatening my Angela? My inner chihuahua radar goes into overdrive. I growl, a low, rumbling sound in my chest that’s surprisingly intimidating for a creature of my stature. Angela glances down at me, a little smile flickering across her lips. “Easy there, Spork. Let’s hear what’s going on.”

Amanda’s voice trembles. “I’m… I’m trapped! It’s a disaster! A complete and utter catastrophe!”

Trapped? Catastrophe? My heart thumps like a drum solo. This is it! This is the moment I’ve been waiting for! My chance to prove my bravery, my fierceness, my unwavering loyalty. I’m not just a cute lapdog; I’m a goddamn hero in a tiny, chihuahua-shaped package!

“Trapped where Amanda, what happened?” Angela asks, her voice now laced with concern.

“At… at the yoga studio!” Amanda wails. “It’s… it’s the inversion swing! I can’t get out! I’ve been hanging upside down for like, twenty minutes! My head is throbbing, and I think I’ve lost feeling in my left foot!”

An inversion swing? Yoga studio? My heroic vision falters slightly. This isn’t exactly battling a dragon or rescuing a princess from a tower. But trapped is trapped! And Amanda is Angela’s friend! The principle remains the same. Adventure calls, and I, Spork, am ready to answer.

Angela bursts out laughing. “Amanda, you’re trapped in a yoga swing? Seriously?”

“It’s not funny, Angela! It’s terrifying! And my leggings are riding up in a really unflattering way!”

Okay, maybe a little funny. But still! A friend in need? A chihuahua must heed!

“Alright, alright, calm down. I’m coming. Stay put. Don’t… I don’t know, don’t try to do anything crazy.” Angela says, getting up from the couch. “Spork, we have a mission!”

Mission! My ears prick up again. Mission! Yes! I leap off the couch, landing with a surprisingly graceful thump for a dog with stumpy legs. I run in excited circles around Angela’s feet, barking my battle cry – a high-pitched yip that sounds more like a squeaky toy than a fearsome roar, but it’s the thought that counts.

“Come on, little soldier,” Angela chuckles, grabbing her keys and her purse. “Let’s go rescue the damsel in distress… who is apparently upside down in spandex.”

We rush out the door, Angela scooping me up and tucking me securely into my carrier bag. Normally, I’m not a fan of the bag. It cramps my style. But today, it’s the Batmobile! The vessel that will transport us to the scene of the… *Inversion Swing Incident*.

The car ride is a blur of excitement. I peer out the window, my tongue flapping in the breeze, imagining we are hurtling through a treacherous jungle, dodging rogue tennis balls and monstrous squirrels. Angela, meanwhile, is humming along to the radio, probably thinking about how to heroically untangle Amanda from her hanging predicament. Me? I’m strategizing. Should I chew Amanda's hair? Maybe bark motivational instructions at her? Perhaps a strategic lick to the face to calm her nerves? I consider *all* my options.

We arrive at the yoga studio. It’s a bright, airy space, smelling faintly of lavender and sweat. Angela rushes inside, me bouncing excitedly in my carrier. “Amanda?” she calls out.

And then we hear it – a muffled, slightly hysterical voice coming from the back of the studio. “Back here! Hurry! My blood is rushing to my head and I’m pretty sure I'm seeing stars!”

Angela bursts through the door to the back room, and there she is. Amanda. Hanging upside down in a silk swing, her face red, her hair a mess, and her leggings definitely riding up in a way that, alright, was a little funny.

But seeing Angela, Amanda’s face lights up with relief. “Angela! Thank god! I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life like this! A bat-yoga exhibit!”

Angela approaches cautiously, circling Amanda like she’s a delicate piece of furniture. “Okay, okay, okay, let’s see… how did you even…?”

“I was trying a new pose! The ‘Upside Down Warrior’ or something. And I got in, but now I can’t get out! The fabric is all tangled!” Amanda explains, sounding increasingly close to tears (or laughter, it’s hard to tell with her upside down like that).

Angela examines the swing, poking and prodding at the fabric. “Hmm, yeah, it’s pretty twisted. Hold still.”

And then, the most amazing thing happens. Angela, my Mama, looks down at me in my carrier. “Spork, buddy, I think we need your help.”

My ears shoot straight up. My moment! My destiny! She needs *me*!

Angela unzips my carrier and gently lifts me out. She places me on the floor, pointing at the tangle of fabric around Amanda. “Think you can… uh… bite that bit right there? Just gently! We don’t want to hurt Amanda’s leggings.”

Bite? Yes! Biting is my specialty! Forget barking orders or motivational licks. This is where a chihuahua’s natural talents truly shine!

I puff out my chest, feeling ten times my actual size. I strut over to the swing, assessing the situation with the big, buggy, keen eye of a seasoned professional rescuer. I locate the offending tangle of fabric. It looks… chewy.

Okay, maybe not chewy. But definitely… bite-able.

With a mighty growl (okay, maybe a slightly pathetic little yip-growl), I lunge forward and… gently nibble at the fabric. Then a bit harder. Then, feeling the pressure of the moment, I give it a good, solid, chihuahua-sized chomp.

The fabric yields! Not dramatically, not with a heroic rip. More like a… quiet sigh. I give another solid chomp and give it my best head shake! And it works! The tension releases, and Amanda slowly, awkwardly, but successfully, unwinds herself from the inversion swing and collapses onto the yoga mat in a heap.

“I’m free!” she gasps, taking deep breaths. “I’m actually free! Oh, Angela, you’re a lifesaver! And… Spork? Did he… did Spork just rescue me?”

Angela beams, scooping me up and showering me with kisses. “He did! My brave little Spork! You’re a hero!”

I lick Angela’s face, my tongue wagging triumphantly. Hero? Yes! I, Spork, the chihuahua with the perpetually crooked tongue, have saved the day! Okay, maybe it wasn’t battling a dragon. And maybe it was just biting some yoga swing fabric. But in Amanda’s world, in Angela’s world, in *my* world, it was an epic rescue. And that’s all that matters.

Later, back at home, curled up on Angela’s lap again, I bask in the glow of my heroic deeds. Angela and Amanda are recounting the yoga studio adventure, laughing hysterically. They’re calling me “Sir Spork the Brave,” and “Spork, Defender of Upside Down Yogis.” I lap up the attention, the head scratches, the feeling of being adored and appreciated.

Being a chihuahua hero isn’t always about grand gestures or mighty roars. Sometimes, it’s about a well-placed nibble and a whole lot of love for your humans. And you know what? I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Especially if it involves extra peanut butter treats. A hero’s gotta refuel, after all.

This happens every day where people will fill coffee cups to the brim and spill tsunamis of coffee while carrying them to the counter. Not to mention it's a slip hazard, I can't be at the coffee station every second of the day since I have a million other tasks I need to finish too!

She calls the store 20 minutes later and the manager thankfully took my side because she knew it was a phony report and threw it out. Apparently the customer reported me because ""I had an attitude"" even though I only said that one thing to her (in a calm manner) and because I questioned her on why she needed my name because at first I was confused, as no sane person would report such a small non-issue. Why twist someone's words over nothing?

People get offended over the dumbest reasons these days. They think they're entitled to make a huge mess and do whatever they want and lose their temper the second they get told to stop. This is what happens when you raise a whole generation without telling them no and spoiling them rotten. Also I'd hate to see what her kitchen looks like!

28F 5’4”

Over the last three months I have had a severe drop in motivation. My grandma passed away on Halloween, I flew on a plane three times since then to handle family matters, along with holidays. I’ve just been so exhausted. I’m also a mom to a kid not yet in school, and planning the meals for my kid burns me out enough, that for myself I have just been kind of living off of their scraps, chocolate, bread, and coffee with creamer. I’m averaging around 2000cal a day.

I want to get back to the 1300 I was successfully hitting and staying at every day. I felt great about the food I was making for myself. I just feel so stressed between working full time, single parenthood, all of the family stuff, losing someone who was more like a mom than a grandma to me. I’m at 172lbs as of today though I am also pretty bloated from higher sodium intake this week. 

Any advice? I don’t know if I can reasonably commit to 1300cal again for now or upping my exercise goals to make up for the increased intake. But anyone around my weight and height able to achieve weight loss at a higher intake still fairly sedentary? Or is it just that I may have to wait things out a bit mentally to sort myself out and adjust a bit more? Thank you!",7,1738199283.0,CICO,8,0.89,False

Worried about getting hurt.,"I'm supposed to meet a guy from Bumble this weekend. I am only looking for a serious relationship and cannot do casual. His profile didn't say what kind of relationship he is looking for, so I asked him. Below is how our conversation went. Does it seem emotionally safe, or should I be worried that he won't be really looking for something serious and could string me along? His answer was a little hard to decipher.

Him: I mean I think it would be great to meet someone I’d want to start a relationship with. I’ve just met some people through the app that I’ve become friends with and people who are here like semi short term for like a year or whatever and they’ve wanted something different: like more than casual, less than serious. So I just kind of meet people I think might be interesting and see how it goes. 🤷🏼‍♂️

So yeah, while finding a long term relationship is the ideal outcome, I’m sure you understand that socializing in [country] for expats not always easy and so I guess I didn’t pick anything to keep the door cracked open to allow for friendships and so on that might otherwise not be possible when you’re explicit or too set on your expectations. Does that make sense?

Me: I'm not sure. Just to be clear, I am dating with the intention of finding a long-term partner. Obviously, it has to evolve naturally, and I wouldn’t rush into anything, but if there’s anything more than friendship, I’d be hoping it leads to a serious relationship. I can't do casual romantic relationships.

Him: Noted. I appreciate you sharing your expectations clearly. I wasn’t going into this looking for or expecting something casual either. Let’s just have some coffee and see how it goes!",3,1738198645.0,TwoXChromosomes,15,0.67,False

I’ve always been thin and very fussy with food from a young age, nothing major really I was a pretty normal kid in terms of health.

I purposefully tried to develop anorexia at 14 abit before covid lockdown after seeing it glamorized on social media and also from just being an insecure teenage girl.

It obviously developed into a real disorder and got worse over time (Anorexia turning to orthorexia turning to bulimia) I never received any treatment at the time because I never told anyone close to me about it. Weirdly the weight & wanting to be thin factor sort of fizzled out by itself at around age 17, after lockdown as I went out into the real world and realized how thin I really was compared to others. 

I sort of just carried on with life after that, not really paying attention to what i eat as much. I still had alot of insecurities for sure and would definitely freak out if i gained too much weight, but it didn’t control my life as much as it seemed to before. 

I was so so wrong. 

About a year ago I went into eating disorder therapy, recommended by my doctor as I was having trouble with my energy levels, desire to eat and mentioned I had been restrictive in the past. My main therapist was a gem, she mentioned arfid to me, which i didn’t know about before, and i understand it’s common with people on the spectrum (which i believe i may be) or people in recovery.

It didn’t really last long because the higher ups saw my disregard for weight as being recovered lol and transferred me to the mental health unit instead.

I never followed through with anymore mental health care after that as being in the UK under TORY CONTROLLED NHS is hell. 

I’m now 19 years old and for the past 2 years I have probably ate recommended intake of a fetus. Not because I want to lose weight, but because I literally cannot eat. I have no desire to be extremely underweight or control what I eat, I haven’t looked or cared about calories or health labels for a long time. 

But yeah I literally just can’t, I forget to eat all day until I  feel nauseous, shaky and faint.
I don’t really enjoy food anymore and always go for liquids when i’m hungry like coffee or soup. I have also become way more fussy, texture becoming a huge problem especially.

I am also a very mentally unstable person, high anxiety, extreme depression, self hate and anger and also undiagnosed signs of autism. I’ve never seen my mood impact my eating until this past year, it’s so strange. 

It’s like every year I deteriorate more and the most annoying part is I DONT EVEN WANT IT ANYMORE RELEASE ME PLEAAAAAAASE

Even more confusingly, I’m not losing any weight in the process. Steadily maintaining a relatively healthy bmi which just makes no sense to me. 

On the positive side I have decided to take up cooking from scratch which has helped with my fussiness as I sort of know what to expect when I eat my food and can cook it in a way that makes me comfortable to eat. However on the days that I’m too tired to cook I pretty much don’t eat at all besides afew coffees, a biscuit or brunch bar ( which i’m starting to hate too now ).
Eventually I’m just not gonna like any food at all i fear if this carries on.

This mall is in very bad shape. You can see from the pictures that it's not very well maintained at all, and the second floor especially felt grimey and gross. The food court was mostly vacant, and most of the vacant stands, instead of being cleaned up and leased out, are just being covered up with black tarp. The first floor fares a bit better. There was a decent amount of activity, but not too much. The abandoned Dairy Queen/Orange Julius still had trash littered there from when it closed. One of the entrances is completely shut down.

It's strange, because the parts of this mall that are clean are really clean. The individual stores that are still open seem to be doing a good job of taking care of themselves. It's odd.

I do like the aesthetic of the mall. It's very of it's time, and I love how teal and blue it is. It's almost retro-futurist in it's architecture and I really appreciate that. Too bad it looks like the mall had barely been renovated in the past 30+ years.

And then, there was the sinkholes. Last year around Christmastime, sinkhole hazards popped up around this mall, posing serious safety concerns. It was nearly enough to kill the mall entirely. I'm honestly shocked that the mall survived, given that before the sinkholes, it was already in poor shape. This mall just in general gives off the vibe of being hazardous. 

On a positive note though, there's two stores I really like here - the coffee shop and the arcade. The coffee is great and high-qualty, and decently priced. The arcade has an incredible collection of games ranging from modern to 80s and even 70s cabinets. It's a treat. Too bad it's trapped here.",17,1738198477.0,deadmalls,3,0.96,False

1id9r8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1id9r8p/guests_demanding_refunds_because_florida_isnt/,Guests demanding refunds because “Florida isn’t supposed to be cold!”,"As I’ve been open about it previously, I don’t work at a property. Rather, I’m an extended stay guest. I’ve gotten to know the staff very well, and there is one front desk worker with whom I’ve become good friends. Knowing she was working a double shift the other day, I picked up dinner for her when I went to get my own takeout. Whenever I do this, I always wait quietly to the side of the front desk until all other guests have been assisted and I can then give her the food and say hello for a few minutes.

Well, this particular day (Thursday of this past week) there was an abnormally LOOOOONG line of people waiting to be helped by the sole front desk employee (her second shift coverage called out sick, GM & owner had already taken off for the day, and the only other employees on property were the one security guard and one maintenance personnel who remained only because the owner wanted him to install planters along the edge of the pool as he’d supposedly seen at an upscale hotel in Miami) Thus, the poor front desk employee was effectively solo and all I could feasibly do was quietly wait and observe until all guests had exited the front desk area.

ISTG that everyone in line was bundled up in MASSIVE parkas with scarves and gloves… it was 35 degrees in Florida that day, but if you’d merely seen a picture of the front lobby you’d have thought the hotel was in Minneapolis, Chicago, or somewhere in New England. THEN… I began to hear a woman get louder and more aggressive with the front desk employee because she wanted a refund since she’d booked a weeklong trip to Florida, but there was a cold front plus foggy cloud cover and she hadn’t been able to “experience Florida’s warm weather and sunshine!” *I cannot make this up!!!*

Obviously, the front desk employee said she couldn’t refund the guest for the previous five nights of her stay since she’d already completed those days, but she could refund her for the following two nights and cancel those two days of the reservation. As this conversation was going on, the people in line began talking amongst themselves, and then eventually to people coming in to get coffee from the lobby, about how they could get refunds for their stays because of the weather 😮 😳 The line at the front desk grew longer after the chatter made its way to more guests in the lobby… eventually, the front desk employee had to call the owner several times (the owner never offered to come in to assist btw) before the initial guest and her party (apparently she was with a group comprising five rooms total) were given refunds for their final two nights once those nights were removed from their reservation. 

But what followed was a series of subsequent guests going up to the desk asking for discounts on their stays or refunds because they weren’t able to enjoy the Marina, outdoor tiki bar, or poolside area (the pool itself is heated to 85 degrees) because it was in the 30s/40s/50s all week and unusually rainy/foggy/cloudy. One couple from Europe SCREAMED at the front desk employee about how they’d flown over to Florida for the sunny warm weather but didn’t get to enjoy it and how the weather was forecast to become warmer the day they were scheduled to leave.

What baffles me is that it wasn’t just a single guest who tried to get a refund based on something as utterly ridiculous as the weather!! I swear that I’ve never heard such a ridiculous thing in my life, much less from SEVERAL different guests!! Yes, the word of mouth train did disseminate the false notion that guests could get refunds due to the weather and that prompted more people to line up at the front desk, but damn!!! Just the first woman demanding a refund due to weather is absurd!!

I’m posting this now because I just saw the front desk employee for the first time since last Thursday when this saga unfolded, and she said that the first woman ended up being compensated for her entire stay the following day because she came back and spoke with the owner who gave in! 

This has to be the most ridiculous reason to ask for a refund though, right?? Does anyone have experience with equally or even more absurd guest requests?? I’m still BAFFLED by this nearly a week later!!!

1id9qbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1id9qbd/chapter_two_whispers_in_the_dark/,CHAPTER TWO: WHISPERS IN THE DARK,"

I had always thought of my apartment as a refuge—a cocoon of familiarity. Now it was a trap. Every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind against my windows, felt alive with malevolence. My door still bore faint scratches from the night I found that scrap of paper, the one reading “Underneath, then watch.” I couldn’t sleep. I drifted off in the early mornings and woke up drenched in sweat by mid-afternoon, my spine tingling with the sense that I was being watched.

The first night after I reset all my devices, I went to bed fully expecting the worst. But midnight came and went without incident. I even dared to hope that maybe resetting my phone and reinstalling Reddit had severed the connection to whatever had latched onto me. That hope evaporated at exactly 2:13 AM when my phone buzzed, even though I’d turned it off completely.

I jolted awake, eyes glued to the device on my nightstand. My lock screen glowed white-hot in the darkness. There was no app notification this time, just a single line of text etched across the screen like a jagged scar:

“Do you remember the pain?”

My finger hovered above the power button, breath caught in my throat. Before I could shut the phone off, the text blinked out, replaced by an image so grainy I could barely make out what it was—until I recognized the faint outline of my own bed. I realized with sickening certainty that the picture was being taken right then, from the foot of the bed. But I was alone in the room. Or so I thought.

I hurled my phone away, heart battering my ribcage. It slid under the bed, illuminating the darkness with an eerie glow. In that glow, I swear I saw a shape under there—something impossibly long and pale, bent at an angle no human limb could achieve. I froze, too terrified to move closer. When I worked up the courage to take a cautious peek, the phone was dark. No shape. No silhouette. Just an echo of the horror I was sure I’d seen.

The Stranger Online

The next day, I broke my silence and posted on a throwaway Reddit account. I posted in r/Paranormal, r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix—anywhere that might take me seriously. The replies ranged from trolls to bored skeptics. But one stood out. A user named u/OuterRabbit wrote:

> “Don’t look for it. You’ll only feed it.”



Their profile was empty, except for a single post titled “It wants you alone.” I clicked. The text was nothing but ASCII art resembling an open door, wide and waiting. My scalp prickled. I tried messaging the user, but my DM wouldn’t go through. Within minutes, the entire account disappeared.

That night, my neighbor hammered on my wall. He’d never done that before, and I jumped at the noise. I pressed my ear against the plaster, hearing him yell something about a rancid smell coming from my apartment. Confused, I sniffed the air—no smell. But then I caught a whiff of something damp and metallic, like rust. I followed it into my bathroom, heart pounding, throwing on the light. Nothing was out of place…except the mirror. The corners of it looked darker than usual, as if a shadowy residue clung to the edges.

A single drip of something red slid down the glass. I reached out, expecting it to be water tinted by the overhead light. But when my fingertip came away crimson, my stomach turned. I wiped the mirror with a cloth, only to reveal faint words drawn in that same deep red:

“LOOK UNDERNEATH, THEN WATCH.”


---

Something in the Walls

I abandoned my bathroom, locked it shut. By now, it was well past midnight, and I felt trapped in my own home. The clock in my living room blinked midnight, then 1:00 AM, then 2:00. Every new minute was a countdown to that dreaded 2:13.

When it finally arrived, I felt the atmosphere in my apartment change. The air grew thick, pressing against my ears like I was underwater. My phone, which I had locked away in the kitchen drawer, buzzed so violently that the drawer shook. I didn’t dare open it. Then my TV roared to life, blasting static at a deafening volume. The remote was on the couch, untouched.

Slowly, the static flickered and formed shapes: silhouettes sliding into focus. At first, it looked like random lines, but then I saw a hallway, flickering with each wave of static. The vantage point moved forward step by step, shaky and urgent. A door at the end was slightly ajar, a candlelit interior beyond. I realized with a jolt that it looked like the same hallway from that horrifying video clip on my phone—the one with the candlelit door.

The camera advanced, and the door swung open. Inside, a figure crouched on the floor, back hunched, impossibly long arms sprawled across the tiles. My pulse hammered so loud, I could barely breathe. The figure turned sharply to face the camera, but there was no face—only a pale expanse where eyes, nose, and mouth should have been.

My TV screen crackled with interference, and the figure twitched closer, in unnatural, jerking movements. A voice scratched through the speakers, like radio static forming words:

“You’re almost there. Keep watching.”

I lunged for the TV’s power button. The screen died, plunging the apartment into suffocating darkness. But then I heard it: slow, deliberate footsteps just beyond my apartment door.


---

A Warning in the Silence

I stood there, tears threatening to escape, every hair on my body standing on end. The footsteps paused. My doorknob rattled once, twice, then stopped. When I finally forced myself to look through the peephole, the hallway was empty—at least, there was no visible person. Yet that rancid smell my neighbor had complained about drifted under the door, making me gag. It was stronger this time, like old meat left in a hot room.

I scrambled to my bedroom, shut the door, and braced a chair against it. I told myself I was safe behind the lock and key. But deep down, I knew that whatever this thing was, locks wouldn’t stop it. Nothing would. I collapsed onto my bed, numb with exhaustion, hoping maybe I could pass out and this would all be a fever dream.

But 2:13 AM refused to let me go. My phone, still rattling in the kitchen, abruptly fell silent. Then came a new sound from the walls—like claws scraping inside them, long nails carving into the studs and insulation. With each shudder of plaster, my lights flickered.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I grabbed my coat and fled my apartment without even packing a bag. Only when I reached the street did I realize I had no destination in mind. The city was asleep, the streetlights casting unnatural shadows across the pavement. Everything felt hostile and unfamiliar. Part of me wanted to run to a friend’s house, maybe call the police. But what would I say? There’s a faceless thing haunting my TV, leaving cryptic messages in my mirror? They’d lock me up in a psych ward.


---

Uninvited Company

I ended up in a 24-hour diner, nursing a cup of stale coffee and pretending to read the menu. My reflection in the diner’s window looked hollow, eyes ringed with sleepless panic. When the waitress asked if I was alright, I nearly confessed everything right there. But some primal self-preservation instinct stopped me. If I was being watched, telling someone else might put them in danger.

As the sun began to rise, I ventured back. My apartment hallway was eerily silent. No sign of footprints, no lingering smell of decay. At first, I let out a sigh of relief—maybe I’d outrun it this time. But the moment I stepped inside, I felt eyes on me. A single note lay on the floor, written in shaky black letters:

“Stop running. I see you.”

I didn’t know what to do except slump to the floor in despair, note clenched in my trembling fingers. I’d seen enough horror movies to know there’s rarely a happy ending once you open certain doors. And I had opened not just a door, but a rabbit hole. One that was pulling me deeper with every 2:13 AM that passed.


---

Dark Promises

I’m writing this now in the thin morning light, the only time I feel remotely safe. Every rustle of wind through the window makes me jump. My phone’s battery is dead, and I’m almost too scared to charge it, worried that screen might light up again with something I can’t unsee. Yet there’s a part of me that can’t stand not knowing. It’s an itch I can’t scratch, the urge to find closure, to see if there’s any way out besides permanent darkness.

But a deeper, more primal instinct says: The more you look, the deeper it digs into your life. And if that’s true—if this thing or force or whatever it is feeds on curiosity—then maybe my only real chance is to starve it. Cut it off. Never give it another second of my attention. The question is, can I? Because every night around 2:13 AM, I feel compelled to listen. To look. To watch.

Somewhere, in the back of my mind, the phrase “LOOK UNDERNEATH, THEN WATCH” echoes like a pulse. I have no idea what it means, only that it’s a summons. A promise of something horrifying. And each day, each night, it grows harder to resist.

I’ve never felt more certain of one thing: If I give in, if I watch whatever it wants me to see…there may be no coming back.

1id9pqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamofharmony/comments/1id9pqs/love_on_earth/,love on earth ! ❤️‍🔥🌍💖🎶💞🤲,"love is one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and in a world that often feels chaotic, it's important to recognize and celebrate it. whether it's the kindness of a stranger, a beautiful act of nature, or a moment of deep connection with someone you care about, love is everywhere if we take the time to notice. 

here are a few small but meaningful ways love shows up in our everyday lives:

1. **kindness from unexpected places** \- have you ever had a stranger do something small but deeply meaningful for you? maybe someone paid for your coffee, gave you a genuine compliment, or helped you when you needed it most. love isn't always personal—it can be a ripple effect from one person to another.
2. **love in challenge and resilience** \- sometimes, love is found in the moments when we push through hardship. self-love appears in the way we care for ourselves during difficult times, and communal love emerges when people come together to support one another after a loss or struggle.
3. **animals showing love** \- pets and wild animals alike display love in ways we often underestimate. whether it’s a dog greeting you like you’re their whole world or a bird feeding its mate, love exists in nature just as much as in human hearts. even ecosystems reflect love through their interdependence and harmony.
4. **the love of creation and destruction** \- every time someone makes something with care—whether it’s a homemade meal, a piece of art, or a song—they’re putting love into the world. sometimes, love also means letting go—ending a chapter, releasing an old version of yourself, or dismantling what no longer serves in order to create space for something new.
5. **soul connections** \- sometimes, we meet people who just *get* us, and it feels like we’ve known them forever. these soul-deep connections, whether romantic, platonic, or familial, are reminders that love transcends time and circumstance. but love also exists in fleeting moments—a meaningful conversation with a stranger or a glance that holds unspoken understanding.
6. **love in the unseen** \- love isn’t always loud or obvious. it’s in the way someone remembers your favorite snack, checks in on you, or makes you feel safe just by being around. sometimes, the quietest acts of love are the most powerful.

**how to receive and give more love:** be open to love in its many forms—sometimes, it doesn't look the way we expect. practice gratitude for the small gestures and let yourself express love freely, whether through words, actions, or even presence. making eye contact, listening deeply, and showing kindness without expectation are all simple ways to invite more love into your life.

let’s fill this space with warmth—share a recent moment that reminded you love is real and present in the world. no matter how small, every bit of love makes a difference!",1,1738198120.0,dreamofharmony,0,1.0,False

1id9ok5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1id9ok5,WA Grand Wailea review,"Where we went: WA Grand Wailea in Maui

When we went: the sleepy time between Thanksgiving and festive. I feel this is key to enjoying this property since it was at half capacity or less.

Who went: myself, my wife, my mom and stepdad.

Rooms: booked one Napua ocean view king room and one Napua ocean view 2 queen room. A few days before arrival I received a phone call from the Napua concierge telling me that they were upgrading the king room to the Napua nani suite while the two queen room would be a connecting room.



Service: 10.
The service was very good. I've been to this property 4 times and this was easily the best service that I've had there.
The Napua concierge folks were great. They had inquired 3 months before arrival about what we would like to do while in Maui. They had offered to book anything that we needed as well as arrange things at the property. They had great local knowledge of restaurants and activity/tour providers. I had various things booked in advance then we got a bit of a curve ball. My wife broke a toe about 3 hours before Blacklane was to arrive at the house en route to the airport. I contacted the Napua concierge when we landed and changed various reservations to things on the property and it was super easy.

Housekeeping was on point daily. The bellman was quick and very friendly. Valet was excellent. I called ahead of time and my vehicle was waiting for me every time. The staff in the Napua lounge were very nice and attentive. The lounge was clean and stocked at all times. The ability to get cocktails and wine in togo cups was rad. 
Bar and restaurant staff were very good. Service at the adult pool, grotto bar, as well as cabana service were very friendly and attentive. Table service at the luau was great.
Service at Humu Humu was particularly excellent. The pacing of courses was spot on.
Spa services were wonderful. Check in was smooth, the attendants were very helpful and the therapists did great work while being super nice.
I found the service staff to be very engaging and friendly. I had numerous conversations with members of the Napua concierge staff as well as the lounge attendants. Everyone addressed me by name and inquired on how our stay was going. The pool and cabana attendants/cocktail staff did the same, as did the spa staff. I saw similar interactions with friendliness and professionalism play out time and time again with different guests. 


Property: 9

The property is fabulous but they still need to bring back the water elevator and the foundations by the entrance.

Communal space: The lobby is big and inviting. There are cool sculptures surrounded a large lobby bar and lounge. There are benches around to hang out on as well. There are various stores adjacent to the lobby in case you need sandals, a hat, a new watch, or a piece of artwork to take home.
The pool complex is huge. The slides, lazy river, and grotto bar are a nice touch. The adult pool is large and a must at a place like this. There are a lot of lounge chairs and  rental cabanas around the pools and green space by the beach. Getting chairs wasn't a problem for people at this time of year. In the summer there are not enough and it is madness. 
The ground and landscape are well kept. There are palm trees, lush plants, shrubs, fountains, sculptures, and water features all over the place. The pathways and bridges are clean and in good shape with nice lighting at night. The hotel is on Wailea beach. There's a good stretch of beach to walk down and hang out in the waves. The beach is clean and nice. 
** There's a new policy about beach chairs on the beach that is pretty terrible. They supply some beach chairs but not umbrellas. You have to rent the umbrella or a lounger /umbrella. I prefer to have a chair or cabana by the pool then go out and swim in the ocean from time to time. If I liked to lay in a lounger on the beach this would have been an annoyance.

There are multiple bars and restaurants on the property. They do a luau on the property. There's meeting space as well. If you're in the Napua Tower they have two large lounges. There's a wedding chapel on the grounds. They give scuba lessons in a designated pool.

The spa rocks. The waiting area is large and inviting. There menu of treatments is extensive.
There have a men's side, a women's side, and a coed side. The coed space is large with a center pool as well as steam rooms and saunas. I think there was also a juice bar. On the men's and women's sides there is a sauna and steam room as well as a hydrotherapy section which is pretty rad. There's a warm pool as well as various cool down stations. The one that dumps a bucket of water on you is a wake up call. They've got cold plunges too.

The gym is huge and has anything that someone would want. There's different classes as well. 

Nightly live music in the lobby lounge was very nice.


Rooms: 9.5 

The suite was large (1300 sq feet) and well laid out. The living room had a wet bar and mini fridge. There was a small table and chairs, another chair as well as a sectional couch. The balcony off of the living room was large. It had a table for four and a lounger. The patio chairs had adjustable backs which was nice. All of the furniture was very comfortable.
The bedroom was large and comfortable. There was lots of closet and dresser space. It had a Juliet balcony as well as two big arm chairs and ottomans.The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious. Double vanity, water closet, additional closet, stand alone shower(non rainfall) and a huge tub for two. While typical not a bath person I used the tub twice. Excellent water pressure and temperature range also.

The 2 Queen room was big for a 2 Queen room(715 sq feet). The bathroom was a single vanity with a water closet, stand alone shower(non rainfall) and large tub. The room had a mini fridge and coffee station, a small table with 2 chairs as well as a patio that had a small table and 2 chairs. There was good closet and dresser space. The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioning worked well in both rooms. The sheets and comforter were soft and smooth. The pillows didn't suck which was a big relief for me since I often dislike hotel pillows. The bathroom amenities were nice and smelled good. They were Aesop I believe.
We were on the 8th floor so the views from the rooms were spectacular. The lounge was also just down the hall.

Food: 8.5

The Napua lounge provides coffee service from 6-7 am and breakfast from 7-10. They've got a really good multiple drink coffee machine as well as teas and drip coffee. Breakfast is a buffet that consists of many types of fresh fruit, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, 2 different prepared burritos or bowls(1 is vegetarian). There's an assortment of pastries, bread and bagels with various toppings including smoked salmon. There are cereals, oatmeal, meat and cheeses, different veggies. There's a whole bunch of juices, sodas, flavored water, bottled water, and ice cream. Breakfast is good. It isn't amazing and the lack of an omelette station or carving station is kinda meh. It also doesn't change much from day to day. It is right down the hall and you come and go as you please which is great. You can also bring anything to your room/balcony.

From 11am -2pm they have locally made granola bars and bags of popcorn/chips, ice cream bars, as well as a fully stocked drink fridge. From 4-7pm they have an open bar with a small assortment of dishes. There is a salad station with a few options, a cheese and meats section. Some breads, fruit, and a few canapes, either hot, cold, or both. The before dinner stuff is good, not great or anything, but is a great resource if you have a later dinner or are waiting for someone to get ready. Also, you can take anything from there to your room/balcony.


Service at the pool or in the cabanas comes from the Italian restaurant on site, Olivine. The lunch menu has lots of salad, pizza, and sandwiches. All of it was pretty good as far as pool food at a nice hotel goes. The pizza and burger were standouts. Cocktails were also good. 
Olivine also does dinner. The apps were fine but nothing special. The pasta was a let down which is kinda tough for an Italian place. The fish and sides were very good, dessert as well.

The lobby bar had good drinks and very good sashimi. Desserts were good too. 

The food at the luau isn't buffet style anymore. The sides and salad were good like most luau's though nothing special. The roasted pig was excellent.

Fish at Humu Humu was excellent. Went twice and ordered different stuff. Everything was cooked very well and wasn't overly salty. Apps, sides, desserts, and cocktails were very good here. Overall, this was the best food that I tried there. 

Good drinks at the grotto bar. The mai Tai's were bangin'.  That's where the blender is if you want lava flows or a pina colada.

I didn't go to the non lounge breakfast buffet.


Activities and extra:

10. The location and pool complex are doing a lot of the heavy lifting here. There's a ton of stuff to do on Maui and quite a few on property as well. 
You can take scuba and snorkel classes on property. They have loaner beach cruisers for the path along the beach. There are various fitness and yoga classes. They have the luau on property which has some ukulele and hula lessons if you don't want to hit the bar. They have kayaks, canoes, and paddle boards if you want to use them. They have pool floaties. You can check out the bio station or have a photographer session if you want. They have a wedding chapel and salon services at the spa.
I didn't check into it but they've gotta have a kids club of some sort. 

This trip I didn't have the opportunity to play golf or go sailing, ride UTV's, horses, or take a quick helicopter tour but all that stuff is right there plus much more. Being picked up/dropped off can easily be arranged if needed.

With the curve ball the activities went a little different than I had planned. We were on the property a lot but it was a really relaxing, refreshing, and enjoyable trip.
 

Lastly, I've e got to a give a big thank you and shout out to our fabulous mod u/alex_travels who handles all of my bookings. I always check out of the hotel in person. Here you do it at the Napua concierge desk. They were wonderful all week and hoped that I would have good things to report to my TA. Having stayed multiple times in the past I never got the sense that the success of my stay was of any higher priority than anyone else's stay. This time I did from the very beginning when I checked in with the Napua concierge. I've also had that same sense at many of my other stays since becoming a client. Thank you Alex!!

I am simply here because I find myself texting my real life friends and siblings but rarely get the enthusiasm and attention I am seeking. I know everyone has their own life but I seem to always be there for them and whenever I am excited about something, they disappear. 

With that said, I am a divorced mother trying to navigate the dried up dating scene. I have good days and bad days. I’d love to have people to talk to and feel comfortable with.

I need advice. I’m a 33 year old female. Sagittarius sun, Sagittarius moon and and Cancer rising. He is a 37 year old male. Scorpio sun and moon (not sure of his rising sign). I’ve been with this man almost 3 years. The thing is we aren’t really together anymore. When we first met I was skinny, active and happy. September of 2022. We started dating and he soon engulfed me in his pit of misery. We went on one “date” to the local Mexican restaurant. Other than that, we sat at his house chugging beer/shots and playing video games. And it would always end badly. He wants to play a particular game and I don’t so he throws a fit and flips over the coffee table in rage. But we’ve continued hanging out. All of this time. I gained a lot of weight over the last 3 years, almost 100 pounds. Mainly because of depression and sitting around drinking beer playing video games on the couch with him. He told me maybe 1.5 years ago he wasnt attracted to me anymore. Sexually. That he loved me and my personality but he just couldn’t have sex with me because I was “big” now. So we havent had any physical contact other than pecks on the lips/cheek in well over a year. I should have left then. The thing is, he’s also my best friend. We still hang out multiple times a week, playing video games and smoking/drinking. We talk every day, all day. Good morning, I love you, goodnight etc. We talk every day about all kinds of things, family stuff, we watch the same sports and we do have a lot in common. But when we get together with alcohol, which is every time we hang out, it almost always turns bad. We will have weeks sometimes where we just chill, but even then he guilt trips me when I don’t want to come see him (currently) it’s just been a horrible experience and I know I need to cut ties all together but it’s hard because he’s like my best friend. Any advice? He also lives like 10 mins away from me, which makes this even more awkward. This is my very first Reddit post ever, I just don’t know how to do this. Thank you for any help.

I said yes and we exchanged information. We started going on dates and I was really, really into her. everything seemed perfect. she’s kind, intelligent, funny, and we have a lot in common. i genuinely could’ve seen myself dating her for quite a while. I brought it up to a few of my friends, and told them her name. Suddenly, they all started freaking out and told me i needed to cut it off IMMEDIATELY. As it turns out, a few of them went to high school with her and have known her for years. they began telling me story after story about how she went around breaking guys hearts and being “insane” (both guys and girls in my friend group attested to this). she has allegedly had 4 boyfriends over the past year, and has a reputation for being a heartbreaker. however, none of them have seen it first hand, and it’s essentially conjecture. ALL of my friends who grew up in the city I’m at for uni with this girl have said pretty much the same thing. 

So, i broke it off with her after two weeks of dates and talking. it honestly broke my heart quite a lot, and she was very confused because it had been going so well. we talked it out and she wished me the best and i went on my way. 

it’s been about two weeks since the cut off and i genuinely cannot stop thinking about her. i have daydreams about when we went out together, her laugh and sigh when i kissed her, and everything else. i keep having DREAMS about her. it’s honestly been keeping me awake at night. on one hand, i trust and believe my friends. i fully believe that they do want what’s best for me and we’re trying to look out for me. on the other hand, she is PERFECT. exactly my type in every single way possible. i’ve dated around quite a bit and i’ve definitely dated a few girls who were not ready for a relationship (fully knowing i shouldn’t), but i never got any red flags from her whatsoever. she treated me amazingly in every way possible. it’s honestly messing me up and i’d love some advice 

TL;DR: met a girl and started talking for a few weeks. she’s exactly my type but my friends said she’s crazy and will ruin my life so i cut it off. i’m now having a lot of regrets.",2,1738197664.0,relationshipadvice,3,0.75,False
1id9iid,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1id9iid/final_day_in_medellín_a_mixed_bag_at_my_favourite/,Final day in Medellín: a mixed bag at my favourite café,"I'm near the end of my trip and decided to go to the café in El Poblado that I visited 40+ times during my first trip to Colombia. I went there so, so many times because the staff were very tolerant of my poor Spanish during that trip and I wasn't forced to speak English. The goal was to get them to speak normally to me. To not change their phrasing, the words they used or the speed at which they spoke. In other words, to treat me like a local. The time I spent there was a mixed bag. 

I've always been treated the same by them, during both visits. That's to say like a Spanish learner at a low level. It's not their job to monitor my level in Spanish and they probably don't care all that much about one guy's progress. Honestly, I was surprised that they all remembered me 6 months after my first trip.

I'm not going to share the name of the place. It's small, few people work there and the people I meet haven't agreed to such things.

Naturally, as much as people in this situation may want to help, they're busy. They have dozens of customers during a normal day and they're paid to serve coffee and baked goods, not to cater to my Spanish needs.

I asked them to speak to me in the way I described and there was no problem with my interactions with them. I understood everything perfectly. I screwed up a question simply because I had no idea how to phrase one thing in particular, but that was all. Again, though, these interactions weren't 10-minute conversations. You don't always get what you want.

The negatives of this experience were all down to the location; it's in El Poblado, the most touristy part of the city. As a result, I had to hear some of their customers speaking English.
I briefly interacted - in Spsnish - with a customer who was clearly a native speaker, but she was joined by a very white person who clearly was not. I didn't use English in this place and it would take a lot to force me to do so.

The aforementioned very white woman was complaining during her conversation about how touristy Colombia is. In English. That cracked me up because she's white AF, clearly a tourist and only speaking English. In El Poblado. Complain in Spanish, sure, but if you only speak English and are clearly a tourist, you blatantly lack self-awareness in this situation. It was hilarious and of course frustrating to hear these people speaking English.

On the other hand, a married couple who some of the employees obviously knew came in and the wife started talking about her new dietary restrictions. This included not being allowed to eat bread. I interjected and asked if this included arepas. The husband said yes and I said that half my gut/extra weight was due to arepas. The response was ""do you swear?"" which is somewhat odd phrasing to me, but not everything translates well. The point is that I understood the whole conversation and I was completely understood when I interrupted.

I'll explain why in more detail in my trip report, but I would generally recommend that Spanish learners avoid El Poblado. Medellín is a huge city with many zones and many of them are lovely.

I have a flight to Bogotá early tomorrow morning and 4 nights there before my flights to Barcelona and then back to the UK. I stayed with the same hosts at the end of my first trip, so I hope they'll notice a difference in my Spanish!",6,1738197586.0,dreamingspanish,0,0.8,False
