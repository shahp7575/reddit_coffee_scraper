1m638nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m638nk/ms_old_friends_pt_1/,[MS] Old Friends (Pt. 1),"My friends told me that retiring at forty-eight would be a walk in the park, but they failed to mention that you can still trip and fall. It was only a month after I retired that my wife and I had separated from our twenty-three years of marriage, and my now ex-wife, Monica, would tell anybody else that the fault was mine. After retiring at the top of the detective class, a title I held true for fifteen years, we tried to start a family. Unfortunately, after not having any luck, Monica went to see a doctor and found out about her infertility. The following week, I came home after grocery shopping in the morning, and she was gone. All that had been left behind was a note in which she called me selfish and blamed me for the failure of our marriage. The divorce papers were served the following Friday afternoon. I was watching TV when the doorbell rang; I clicked the TV off and answered the door to a young kid who smelled of weed and cheeseburgers.

""Here ya go, sir, you have been served.""

Besides my life coming down harder than the Roman Empire, I would say it's been simple.

July 23, 2032

Today, I woke up in a better mood and took my dog, Ranger, out for a walk. Ranger was a dog I had given Monica as an anniversary present; Ranger was more of a gift for me since Monica had something against dogs. When Ranger and I walked home, the mail courier left my porch.

""Good afternoon, sir; it's good that you showed up so I can deliver your package. Stay safe and have a good day.""

He handed the package to me, and in a split second, his eyes caught mine, and I noticed an eerie, wide smile across his face. Although before I was able to say anything else, he walked up to his mail truck and drove away. Once inside, I set the package on the coffee table and made dinner. Monica cooked a lot of the time, but I was no stranger to the stove. After I ate, I sat on the couch with a cold beer and watched the news.¬†

8:46 pm

It did not take long for the package to catch my attention again; the box was unorthodox, and it seemed to be wrapped almost as if it were a gift. The cardboard box was wrapped in brown paper and tied closed with butcher's twine. The post label only had my name and mailing address, but no return address. I decided to open it because, in my eyes, I had nothing else to lose. I got up, grabbed scissors from the kitchen drawer, and snipped it open. A small, square box, its white surface reflecting the light above me, contained a cassette tape with a note inside. The tape was labeled with a permanent red marker,

""Bygones.""

The sight of the tape left me wondering what all this could mean. I could not help but feel like a thousand eyes were staring at me from the inside. Then I remembered the Walkman Monica left behind; she said it was half-broken but still played tapes decently. I had practically torn the house up looking for it, but I popped it in and started the tape once I found it.

""Hello Jonathan, long time no talk, I wouldn't expect you to know me by my voice, but I just wanted to make contact. Ten years ago, you ran into your first wall as a detective with my case, the bombing of the metro train station. Twelve people: five adults, three kids, and four elderly. All died in vain because you couldn't do your job right, and the press wrote me off as dead just because you couldn't figure out who I was. So because of all this, their blood stains your hands to this very day. If you want to make things right, meet me at the address on the back of the note, and there you shall be executed for your crimes against the ones you swore to protect.""

I took off the headphones and walked to the kitchen, staggering for balance, my heart thumping against my chest, it echoed in my silence. I picked up a new beer bottle, opened it, and chugged it to finish. The only mistake in my career has come back to haunt me, and my world is crumbling. The retirement that bores me, my wife leaving me because I'm unable to satisfy her, and now the one who got away wants to see me meet my end. Although I do not think they were counting on me having nothing to lose, and with this, I will make my own end. The note was in the white box; it had been a sticky note with a location and time:

""WEST SHIPYARD 8 O'CLOCK; COME ALONE.""

The bottom script provided me with a date for the meeting, and I prepared accordingly.

I'm looking for tips - e-shops, Instagram profiles, small businesses - basically any place I could get some meaningful gifts for people. I don't have anything particular in mind - I would just like it to be Ukraine-""themed"", by colors or words.

What I have so far are some random socks and coffee mugs in my shopping cart at Rozetka üòÖ I'm sure there's more to be found there, but it's also a general store selling anything and everything, and it's overwhelming.

Do you have any recommendations for smaller alternatives, where I could buy some meaningful gifts - household items, clothing, random accessories?

Wet.
Homeless.

Those three words clung to the guy who sat slumped outside my coffee shop in the afternoon rain.

Perfect. 

Thanks to the increasingly erratic weather, I had the privilege of seeing him in all kinds of seasonal wear: a short-sleeved tee and shorts in the late morning while he chewed on a bagel; later at lunch, sporting a jacket and baseball cap. 

Around then, when the sun scorched the sidewalk, he‚Äôd been uncomfortably bent over a dog-eared paperback. 

College student. Early twenties.

I couldn‚Äôt tell if he was enjoying the book, but he flipped through it quickly, head cocked, eyes glued to each page.

When I glanced out later while wiping down tables, the book was gone. 

He was curled up, pressed into a nest of soaked blankets, trying to hold onto what little warmth he could. 

A cheap plastic raincoat was draped over thick brown curls.

I found myself fascinated by him as the day crept on and he shifted positions. 

I made pastries, watching him with floury fingers, mesmerized as he sat, knees pressed to his chest, staring up at the sky. 

He sat up, then lay down, eventually curling into the fetal position, placing the book over his face.

I made the mistake of peeking out of the window while serving a patron. 

The boy lay on his side with his back to me, unmoving. 

I excused myself, grabbed a blanket from the back, and rushed outside. 

From my observations, he didn‚Äôt *seem* sick. 

I nudged him with my shoe, only to be met with a loud protesting groan. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not *moving*,‚Äù he grumbled, curling further into a ball. 

He emphasized his words, yanking the covers tighter around himself. 

With a start, I realized his tone was something authentic that  I could appreciate, sardonic and deadpan, with a sliver of irony.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing anything wrong except existing, and I‚Äôm so sorry for my presence. If you touch me, you'll regret it.‚Äù

I pulled the blanket tighter around me, holding it close to my chest. ""Do you... want to come inside?""

He didn't respond for a moment, twisting around to face me, blinking rapidly through thick brown locks plastering his forehead. ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúYou're not Karen.‚Äù

I frowned. ‚ÄúKaren?‚Äù

‚ÄúKarens,‚Äù he smirked. ‚ÄúPlural. They've been shooting me dirty looks all day.‚Äù 

He cocked his head, amused, maybe intrigued, maybe something entirely else. 

He did seem to suddenly care a lot about his hair, shaking it out of his eyes like a wet dog. 

‚ÄúDid you‚Ä¶ want something, dude?‚Äù

Up close, he wasn‚Äôt the type I expected to be homeless: attractive face, sharp jawline, wide brown eyes that reminded me of rich coffee grounds, and freckles speckling his nose. 

Having not lived in the human world for long, I had only just started to learn about societal norms and prejudices. 

He was too clean, hair neatly tucked under his hood and his nails clipped. 

His hygiene was intact, and though his clothes were crumpled, a loose pair of jeans and a jacket, they weren‚Äôt stained. 

I was kind of in awe.

This was a boy who took care of himself, even on the streets, and I couldn‚Äôt help but appreciate that. 

Perhaps it was vanity, or maybe just self respect. 

But then, maybe I had been staring at him for too long.

I was aware I was also soaked, my flimsy umbrella doing nothing to protect me from the vicious downpour, my own hair sticking over my eyes. 

The boy regarded me with amusement, tilting his head like a kicked puppy, his lips curled in something resembling a smirk. When I snapped to and offered the (now soaked) blanket, his expression darkened. 

I was so close to him, I could finally see what I couldn't from afar. When I was observing him from the window of my shop, he was an ordinary human. 

But now I could see his face. The one he tried to hide, ducking under his blankets and hidden behind cheap shades. 

I could see the hollowness in his eyes that was so cavernous, endless, with such prominent shadows and a smile lacking so much warmth that I struggled to fully comprehend the depths of this boy‚Äôs despair. 

I had never quite met a human like him before. Through expression alone, I could read a human face. 

I could see their wishes and dreams, their hopes for the future. But this one‚Ä¶ He was *blank*. 

A nothing, a nobody; a terrifying, hollow shell of a human being. 

The best way I can describe it is like an aura blossoming around him, thick mist suffocating his thoughts, suffocating him. 

Squeezing the happiness from his brain. 

But looking at him, I wasn't sure this boy even knew what happiness was, or had ever known it. 

His entire being, his soul, his mark on this planet, was little more than a smear. 

Depression is what humans call it. We call it severing the will to live. 

Humans can learn to live with it by altering their brain chemistry. 

But to us, it's a death sentence.

Worse than the plague that wiped out my kind. The human boy was dripping in it. 

Drowning, but choosing not to break the surface. 

I stumbled back at the thought of it being contagious, my breath catching in my throat. He wasn't just depressed. 

His will to live was already severed, already withering as time cruelly crept on. 

This human boy wanted to die!

No, not just that. 

He was *going* to die. 

I saw eerie confirmation in dull eyes that didn't quite meet my gaze. 

He was planning his death. 

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù the boy‚Äôs lips broke out into a grin, and I found myself momentarily losing my mind. 

He shuffled forward, pulling his blankets tighter around himself. 

I had to refrain from stepping back. ‚ÄúWhat's with the glaring? Do I, like, have something on my face?‚Äù

I ignored his laugh. His entire world was still intact, every loved one alive and well, yet this human demanded a fucking pity party. It was pathetic. His smile was fake.

His attitude was faker. I wasn't allowed to pass unfair judgments. 

That's what humans believed. But I could *still* have an opinion. 

He was exactly why my kind had a particular distaste for his. 

Destroy their own planet, and cry victim. 

In his case, destroy his own life, and blame the world instead. I glimpsed his book. 1984. Typical. 

I had read it six times, and each time was more grueling. 

For such a smart species, you would think they would understand that ‚ÄúWe don't care until it's affecting *us*‚Äù would be recognized. 

They had lived and fought through two world wars, and yet somehow, through pure selfishness, they were repeating the exact same mistakes. 

I knew my kind was not perfect. But we were self aware. 

Humans, however, were going in circles. This particular human was a walking contradiction. 

His attractiveness was a privilege; this boy was a child having a tantrum, crying out to the ‚Äúunfair‚Äù world, and as a protest for not being heard, he was going to take his own life. 

I wished my family had that privilege. I wished they could *choose* to die, instead of coughing up their internal organs and suffocating in their own blood. 

I could feel my blood rising, shivers skittering up and down my spine. 

I had sat with my mother for three days straight. She died on the first day, and I held her, cradling her to my chest. 

Mom didn't want to die. 

She wanted to live. Jun, my sister, who died crying, died coughing up her own ravaged lungs, wanted to *live.* 

This boy was a *coward.* His whole kind were cowards. 

I almost turned and left him, my teeth gritted, my stomach crawling into my throat, revulsion filling my mouth. I had already made my choice with Blue. 

I had made my choice with him two weeks earlier, when he first slumped down on the bench outside my shop and shot me a friendly smile through the window. 

I couldn‚Äôt back out, no matter how much the human boy repulsed me. 

Backing out would mean breaking my last promise to Blue. 

‚ÄúDo you want to come inside?‚Äù I asked him. ‚ÄúCoffee is on me.‚Äù

I wasn't sure I liked the way his eyes raked me up and down as he arched a brow. He offered me another soulless smile with too many teeth. ‚ÄúI'm pretty good here, man.‚Äù

I nodded, maintaining my smile. ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI'm Jules.‚Äù

His smile curled into a grimace, and I took the hint to back away. The human boy‚Äôs expression reminded me of a cornered animal. 

He did the head-tilt thing again, but this time there was a little too much emphasis. 

""I'm sorry, did I fall into an alternate universe where I'm supposed to give strangers my name?"" he demanded.

Jeez, he had mean girl vibes. That‚Äôs what Blue called it, anyway. 

When I didn‚Äôt, or couldn‚Äôt, respond, the boy waved a hand with an eye roll, like I was a stray cat. 

‚ÄúBye.‚Äù His icy glare followed me, brown eyes not as cozy and warm up close as I‚Äôd thought. ‚ÄúStop stepping on my fuckin‚Äô blanket,‚Äù he snapped. 

I detected the slightest accent, like that of a Brit who had lived in the States for most of his life. 

I refused to give up on him. He was an asshole, sure, but he was also vulnerable. He was my second choice, picked from his facial expressions alone. He was so human. That‚Äôs what I wanted. 

""Just a coffee,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou don't have to talk to me. You can sit there, drink it, and then get the fuck out if you want to. But it's raining, and you're soaked, and now I'm soaked, so stop being an *ass* and come inside before I change my mind.‚Äù 

I lifted my shoe from where it had been treading on his blanket, twisted around, and walked away. 

About half an hour later, while I was making drinks for the usual crowd of college kids, he appeared like a specter, soaked through, water dripping from his clothes, peering through the door with wide eyes like a startled deer. 

While he squelched his way toward the counter, three customers abandoned their drinks, making a quick exit. 

Instead of making him coffee, I grabbed him, ignoring his, ‚ÄúWoah, hey! *ow!*‚Äù and led him upstairs to my tiny apartment above the shop, pressing a towel and a change of clothes into his arms. 

As he opened his mouth to protest, I cut him off with a shake of my head. 

‚ÄúThis is my business,‚Äù I hissed, tossing him my bathrobe and shampoo. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not standing there dripping all over my floors.‚Äù

He looked like he might argue, before his eagle eyes found Blue‚Äôs bath bombs in the pockets of my robe. 

Something sour crept into my throat. I thought I got rid of all her things. 

The guy pulled them out, painfully slowly, cupping them in his hands with a smirk. ‚ÄúDoes someone else live here?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot anymore,‚Äù I muttered. 

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù He raised a brow. This guy was childish for his age. ‚ÄúSooo, like, you were dating someone?‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúShe was a friend.‚Äù

I turned away from him before I could show any emotion. 

Blue was a hard subject. Leaving him to shower, I returned to my shop. Every customer was gone; their drinks were still lukewarm as I dumped them in the sink. 

He appeared a little later on, hair still damp and fluffy, wearing one of Blue‚Äôs sweaters and a scuffed pair of jeans. 

He took an uncertain seat and I made him our special.

Brewed coffee beans, ice-cold milk, and a sprinkle of my secret ingredient. 

I noticed him watching me as I worked, chin resting on his fist, head cocked, legs swinging, kind of like a human child. 

‚ÄúOne Bloomshot Brew,‚Äù I said, adding extra cream and sliding it across the counter with a smile. 

‚ÄúEnjoy!‚Äù

He stared down at the drink. 

‚ÄúUhh, what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee.‚Äù I deadpanned. 

I watched him take a hesitant sip, and just like that, his walls began to crumble, his expression softening into a smile as he downed the whole thing. 

He wasn't quite happy; I‚Äôd say he was more comforted. This boy was constantly on guard, always looking for danger. 

Now, though, I watched his resolve splinter with every sip. The coffee was specifically made to hit every taste bud. 

‚ÄúWow,‚Äù he said with a surprised laugh. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs, uhh, that's actually pretty good.‚Äù

He drank the dregs and, just as I thought, met my gaze hopefully. I was already making him another, sliding it over, and he downed the whole thing. 

On his third drink, the boy told me his name, giddy, licking froth from his lips. 

Just a few more, and he'd start talking. 

You see, I designed my coffee with three things in mind. 

I wanted to know names, stories, and get them to just the right amount of comfort. 

‚ÄúI'm Ronan, by the way,‚Äù he said. I made him a fourth coffee, this time our weekend special, Rose and Pine latte. He drank without even questioning it. 

‚ÄúJules.‚Äù I introduced myself again. ‚ÄúNo offence,‚Äù I said, leaning forward, copying his demeanor, resting my chin on my fist. 

‚ÄúBut you look like you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.‚Äù

Ronan shrugged with a sheepish smile. He was on drink number five. 

Which meant I was close. He sighed, resting his face in his arms. 

‚ÄúI don't really talk to strangers, but you seem cool,‚Äù he lifted his head. 

‚ÄúSo I guess I'm accidentally pouring my life out to you.‚Äù He chuckled, but his eyes darkened, gaze dropping to the counter. 

‚ÄúI lost my parents when I was a kid,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúCar crash, or whatever.""

His eyes were suddenly so hollow. 

""I survived, and all I remember is everything being upside down, a red streak of blood across the road‚Äîand the radio was still blasting 80s music. We crashed in the middle of nowhere in the English countryside.""

""When they pulled me out of the wreck, I saw my mom‚Äôs head on the side of the road, and she was still fucking smiling.‚Äù

His smile was faraway, dreamlike, his eyes hollow and vacant, like he'd already given up. Something sour crept up my throat. 

It was familiar. The feeling of drowning but not wanting to resurface. I felt it too. 

I felt it with Mom, and Jun. That's what it was, I thought.  Trauma. The human boy was suffering from *trauma*.

I had only felt trauma, but now I was seeing it in pasty, sunken cheeks, and tired eyes that didn't want to live; didn't *want* to have a soul. 

He straightened up and slid his cup over for a refill. I obliged, though my hands weren't supposed to be shaking as I steamed the milk. Trauma. 

That was the nothing in his eyes, the vacant cavern in his soul, the reason behind his insistence on severing his will to live. I had been through the exact same thing. 

‚ÄúAnyway, I was adopted, and my adoptive parents were fucking assholes. I wasn't a son, I was a servant. They were crazy. Locked me in my room and refused to feed me.‚Äù 

His lip curled. ‚ÄúSo, I left and I've been living on the streets ever since.‚Äù 

His frown splintered into a slight smile, and I knew that smile. I knew that kind of agony. It was endless. Monotonous. 

A dull, pounding pain wrapped around your bones, and it would never go away. Healed  or not, it would never leave. 

Ronan wore that smile proudly, finishing his seventh coffee. ‚ÄúI have a pretty concrete plan for what I'm going to do.‚Äù

The words left my mouth before I could bite them back. 

‚ÄúYou're‚Ä¶ going to...‚Äù I didn't have to say it. 

He surprised me with a snort. Maybe the drinks were stronger than I thought.

""Well, yeah,"" he laughed. ""It's either so warm I feel like I'm baking, or cold enough to make me wonder if I'll make it through the night. People are judgmental and fucking cruel, and I am so fucking tired. I miss my parents, man. I miss my home.""

He met my gaze, wide brown eyes filling with tears he tried to swipe away with his sleeve. His eyes had lost their voice a long time ago, probably when his parents died. 

I understood. I understood his exhaustion, his willingness to let go. But I had made my choice too. 

Weeks ago, when I first glimpsed him through the window, head tipped back, smiling at the sun with wide, wondrous eyes. 

He was the perfect human, even with his flaws, even with his will to live so weathered, and no matter how hard he tried, I wasn't letting him go. 

Instead of speaking, I poured him another drink. 

Coffee number eight. 

It wasn't actually coffee. I was just making steamed milk. 

He drank the whole thing. 

He shuffled closer, lowering his voice, his warm breath tickling my cheeks. 

""Between you and me?‚Äù he murmured. ‚ÄúI'm going to throw myself off the old bridge,"" he scoffed. ""The perfect ending to a sad life.""

‚ÄúCome work for me,‚Äù I said too quickly, my stomach rising into my throat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a spare room in my apartment if you want to crash, and I can offer a decent wage.‚Äù

Ronan‚Äôs smile was unsurprisingly warm. The coffee was already in his system, lowering his inhibitions.

His pupils were starting to expand. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty set, man,‚Äù he said, leaning over the counter to offer a high five. I hesitated before slapping his palm, and he chuckled, drawing back. 

‚ÄúThanks, man. Really. I appreciate you trying to help, but you‚Äôre not going to change my mind. I made my choice when I turned eighteen.‚Äù 

Ronan dragged his thumb around the rim of his coffee cup, his expression crumpling. 

‚ÄúI gave myself five years to be happy.‚Äù He shrugged, and I wondered if he *wanted* to find that something, but never did. 

That was the reason why the human had given up. 

He sighed. ‚ÄúI mean, I've been happy, sure. But I can‚Äôt quite find something worth staying for, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù 

His expression was peaceful, like he was content to walk out of my shop and straight into the path of a truck. He shot me a smile that I knew wasn't a smile. 

It was a goodbye. 

Ronan groaned, his head dropping into his arms. ‚ÄúI want to see my parents again.‚Äù

I fought to keep him talking, leaning forward. I was so close. But this was the hardest part. Getting consent. ‚ÄúRonan.‚Äù

The boy didn't move, content with his face buried in his arms. ‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a spare bed,‚Äù I started to say, before a loud clang cut me off. I twisted around to the shelves behind me, filled with brightly colored bell jars. 

One in particular was moving on its own, subtly sliding toward the edge. I picked it up and peered inside. 

From an outsider's perspective, I was holding a jar with a single lightning bug, a flickering light.

But looking closer, the light bled into the shape of a tiny girl floating on her back, eyes closed, dark brown hair billowing around her. 

I gave the jar a violent shake, and the light glowed brighter, bouncing from one side to the other. 

I heard her sharp squeak, before she dropped to the bottom. 

‚ÄúWhat's *that*?‚Äù

I turned, still holding the jar. 

Ronan was halfway across the counter, wide eyes glued to the jar. 

I tucked her away quickly, ignoring her angry buzzing.

‚ÄúI collect lightning bugs.‚Äù

Ronan rested his chin on his fist, lips curving into a smirk. ‚ÄúLike, fireflies?‚Äù

‚ÄúKind of.‚Äù

He laughed, and it was a good laugh‚Äî a real laugh. 

‚ÄúDude, how old are you again?‚Äù

Out of the corner of my eye, I caught  her glowing brighter, on purpose, trying to catch his attention. It was working. 

Her light was expanding across the jar, and the human boy was already hypnotized, specks of gold reflecting in his eyes. 

Ronan leaned in, transfixed. ‚ÄúCan I see?‚Äù he whispered. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never looked at one this close before.‚Äù 

He reached for the jar before I could stop him, pressing his face against the glass. 

There was so much childlike wonder in his eyes, I didn't move to take it off of him. ‚ÄúWhoa,‚Äù he breathed, tracing her tiny buzzing light with his finger. 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you find it?‚Äù 

He gave the jar a gentle shake. This time, she didn‚Äôt make a sound, just curled tighter at the bottom, wings folded behind her, head tucked in her arms. 

I snatched it back before he could unscrew the lid and set her free. 

‚ÄúIn the forest,‚Äù I said, turning, and placing her back on the shelf. I started to make him his final coffee, but the boy was already standing up and stretching. 

‚ÄúAll right, well, thanks for the coffee and sweater,‚Äù he said with a grin. ‚ÄúCan I keep the sweater? It's actually, like, crazy comfortable.‚Äù

I nodded, hoping I could keep him talking. But he really was leaving. I even picked up the bell jar to try to catch his attention again, like a moth to a flame. 

But this human was smarter than I thought.

I panicked when he grabbed his backpack, offering me a two-fingered salute. ‚ÄúCan you do me a favor, Jules?‚Äù

I found my voice, my chest tight. If I didn't get his consent within the next ten minutes, we were both in trouble. ‚ÄúRonan‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt follow me. Look, you‚Äôre the sweetest guy I‚Äôve ever met, and I‚Äôm pretty sure if I wasn‚Äôt like this, I‚Äôd take you up on your offer.‚Äù

He sneezed into his sleeve, and my gut twisted. It was soft, barely even a sneeze. Ronan swiped his nose, rolling his eyes. ‚ÄúSorry. Allergies, I think.‚Äù he settled me with a wide smile that was at peace. 

‚ÄúBelieve me, the worst thing you can do is force me to stay. I said I‚Äôm fine, and, funnily enough, I‚Äôm actually happier than I‚Äôve ever been.‚Äù Ronan reached the door. 

He sneezed again, wrinkling his nose. I noticed him stumble slightly.

I was already moving toward him. I had minutes. ‚ÄúSounds like you‚Äôre getting sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù Ronan sneezed again, this time violently, enough to jerk his body. 

He didn't see the streak of blood on his palm, swiping it on his jeans. 

He met my gaze, and I could already see it, an ignition of gold speckling his iris. ‚ÄúProbably the rain.‚Äù

He left the store, sneezing again, spraying blood tinged gold across the glass door. I watched as he stumbled forward. 

Two unsteady steps, swaying left and then right,  before his body gave up, and he hit the concrete face-first. 

His first wail was agonizing. I was paralyzed. I had seen it before, but not like *this*. 

His body was already twisting and contorting, head jerking left to right, bloody chunks spilling from his lips. 

The streets were empty when I pushed open the door. I counted down in my head, my own hands trembling. 

Ronan forced himself upright, but his body was already rejecting human norms, his head hanging, as he choked up slithering red. 

Ronan was the first one I had turned without consent, and if I didn't get it, I would be dealing with a dark fairy, a human turned fae with their consciousness intact, their magic unpredictable and twisted, their soul scorched. 

Dark fairies were the reason my world collapsed, why my family was dead. 

I forced myself to stay calm. The human boy could still be saved with his own words. That's why I chose him. 

But when I reached him, his eyes were unfocused and wrong, glassy, with no reflection. I was wrong about him, I thought dizzily, retrieving a blanket and scooping him into my arms. 

Ronan *did* have a soul. I was selfish and judgemental. 

He sneezed again in my arms, choking up a chunk of his lung. 

Fuck. Lungs meant it was deep enough to begin shaping his heart. 

Ten minutes without consent. 

That‚Äôs when the body begins to change as usual. From that point, the clock was ticking. Dark fairies were created from their freedom being stripped away and their inability to choose. 

I managed to carry him back into the shop, just as he screamed, raw, guttural, agonized, His body convulsing so violently that I dropped him. 

His skin was translucent, and I could *see* the change already ripping its way through his body. 

‚ÄúRonan,‚Äù I whispered, gently stroking his hair. I was feverishly aware of his eyes flickering, a bright yellow hue expanding across his pupils. 

His human soul was burning. I forced him to look at me, grasping his cheeks. He did, his head lolling to one side. 

‚ÄúYou told me you want to die. But what if I offered you a new life?‚Äù

""Fuck you,"" he groaned, rolling onto his side. 

The heart came next, slipping from his mouth in wet, slimy tendrils of glistening crimson. His voice was a hoarse cry. ""What did you put in that coffee?""

""Ronan, I'm being serious,"" I hissed, my voice betraying me. ""You have to say yes. That's all you need to say.""

""Get away from me,"" he snarled. ""Get the fuck away from me!""

I held him, cradling his jerking head in my lap. There were two ways I could go. 

With no consent, I could either kill him with raw iron straight through the heart before he could turn, or... I tried one more time, begging him to say a single word. 

It was a verbal contract, a choice he was making. Instead of responding, he spat all over my face.

""Go fuck‚Ä¶ yourSELF!""

His words erupted into a screech that sent his body into an arch. I ran out of time.

""I'm sorry,"" I whispered in his ear‚Äîand I was sorry. It was a method that would usually earn me the death penalty. 

But my species was dead. There was nobody left to punish me. 

The correct way to turn a human was by dosing them over the course of a few hours, which I had done with him. 

Dosing had its limitations. 

It required verbal consent from the human to ensure a mutual turning. 

If a human was turned forcefully, a dark fae was born. 

The alternative, albeit heavily controversial, method was through ingesting fae blood, which stopped the transformation into dark fae. 

I had grown up learning about the dark fae creating armies of changelings through non-consensual turnings. 

Without thinking, I bit into my wrist, ripped it open, and forced it into his mouth. Fae blood was the only thing that could stabilize him. 

""Ronan, please,‚Äù  I tried again. ‚ÄúYou have to accept it,"" I hissed. But he spat it out, his eyes rolling back to pearly whites. 

When he didn‚Äôt respond, I watched his facial structure begin to change, the flesh on his back rippling beneath his shirt. 

His body went still for a moment, limbs slack, head lolling. I shuffled back, knowing what came next. 

Wings burst from bloody flaps of flesh oozing golden light, protruding through his spine. His wings were exactly what I expected: too fragile, like they were made of paper, singed at the edges. 

His hand jerked, and above me, the lights flickered.

The sound of shattering glass barely fazed me as I watched Ronan‚Äôs body begin to change. 

Just then, an angry buzzing light hit me in the face. 

I waved her away, and she zipped over to Ronan, glowing brighter as she shifted into a human form, landing gracefully. Her eyes were wide, lips parted. 

Blue knelt beside the boy, cradling his cheeks as blood pooled from his nose and mouth. She shot me a glare, and I sighed. 

""I don't think you want to see this,"" I told her. 

She stayed stubbornly, and I rolled my eyes. ""It's not just a fairy transformation,"" I said, as blood leaked from every orifice. 

He was in the final stage. 

""It's a dark fairy. He didn't consent to be turned, so I can either kill him before he turns, or let him be reborn as‚Äî‚Äù 

I stopped when Blue tilted her head, blinking at me in confusion. She had no fucking idea what I was talking about.

""Just grab his legs,"" I said, and she did, grasping his ankles. 

His wings reminded me of smoldered glass as they fluttered erratically.

When his skin became too hot to touch, I dropped him just as Blue let out a squeak, stumbling back. 

In the time it took for me to take several steps back, squeezing my eyes shut, something warm and wet hit my face. 

I opened my eyes, and there he was, or *wasn't*. 

Ronan was gone. In his place, shredded human flesh. 

I dropped to my knees next to the human skin, shifted it aside, and plucked out a tiny dim golden light. 

He was limp and covered in blood, his wings like knives cutting my palm. 

When I poked him, he rolled onto his front. I could see his chest moving, hear his bitty breathy gasps.

Blue peered at him, her eyes wide, lips spread into a small smile. 

But she was crying. I picked up a fresh jar, and dropped the boy inside. 

Ronan landed with a *thud*, but he didn't move. 

Fae borns were to be preserved in fairy dust for three days. 

I had no idea what was next for a dark fae. I was in uncharted territory with Ronan. 

I filled the jar, transfixed by the tiny fairy floating, up, up, up, arms dangling, hair haloed around him. 

I screwed the lid on, and gave him a shake for good measure. 

He was perfect. 

Exactly what I imagined. 

What Blue told me, before I took her mind.

It was only a month after I retired that my wife and I had separated from our twenty-three years of marriage, and my now ex-wife, Monica, would tell anybody else that the fault was mine. After retiring at the top of the detective class, a title I held true for fifteen years, we tried to start a family. Unfortunately, after not having any luck, Monica went to see a doctor and found out about her infertility. The following week, I came home after grocery shopping in the morning, and she was gone. All that had been left behind was a note in which she called me selfish and blamed me for the failure of our marriage. The divorce papers were served the following Friday afternoon. I was watching TV when the doorbell rang; I clicked the TV off and answered the door to a young kid who smelled of weed and cheeseburgers. 

""Here ya go, sir, you have been served."" 

Besides my life coming down harder than the Roman Empire, I would say it's been simple. 

July 23, 2032

Today, I woke up in a better mood and took my dog, Ranger, out for a walk. Ranger was a dog I had given Monica as an anniversary present; Ranger was more of a gift for me since Monica had something against dogs. When Ranger and I walked home, the mail courier left my porch. 

""Good afternoon, sir; it's good that you showed up so I can deliver your package. Stay safe and have a good day."" 

He handed the package to me, and in a split second, his eyes caught mine, and I noticed an eerie, wide smile across his face. Although before I was able to say anything else, he walked up to his mail truck and drove away. Once inside, I set the package on the coffee table and made dinner. Monica cooked a lot of the time, but I was no stranger to the stove. After I ate, I sat on the couch with a cold beer and watched the news.¬†

8:46 pm 

It did not take long for the package to catch my attention again; the box was unorthodox, and it seemed to be wrapped almost as if it were a gift. The cardboard box was wrapped in brown paper and tied closed with butcher's twine. The post label only had my name and mailing address, but no return address. I decided to open it because, in my eyes, I had nothing else to lose. I got up, grabbed scissors from the kitchen drawer, and snipped it open. A small, square box, its white surface reflecting the light above me, contained a cassette tape with a note inside. The tape was labeled with a permanent red marker, 

""Bygones."" 

The sight of the tape left me wondering what all this could mean. I could not help but feel like a thousand eyes were staring at me from the inside. Then I remembered the Walkman Monica left behind; she said it was half-broken but still played tapes decently.
I had practically torn the house up looking for it, but I popped it in and started the tape once I found it. 

""Hello Jonathan, long time no talk, I wouldn't expect you to know me by my voice, but I just wanted to make contact. Ten years ago, you ran into your first wall as a detective with my case, the bombing of the metro train station. Twelve people: five adults, three kids, and four elderly. All died in vain because you couldn't do your job right, and the press wrote me off as dead just because you couldn't figure out who I was. So because of all this, their blood stains your hands to this very day. If you want to make things right, meet me at the address on the back of the note, and there you shall be executed for your crimes against the ones you swore to protect."" 

I took off the headphones and walked to the kitchen, staggering for balance, my heart thumping against my chest, it echoed in my silence. I picked up a new beer bottle, opened it, and chugged it to finish. The only mistake in my career has come back to haunt me, and my world is crumbling. The retirement that bores me, my wife leaving me because I'm unable to satisfy her, and now the one who got away wants to see me meet my end. Although I do not think they were counting on me having nothing to lose, and with this, I will make my own end. The note was in the white box; it had been a sticky note with a location and time: 

""WEST SHIPYARD 8 O'CLOCK; COME ALONE.""

My friends would sleep till noon, wake up to cartoons and cereal. Meanwhile, my dad would be banging on our doors at 6:45AM like we were late for basic training.

‚ÄúUp. Let‚Äôs go. Time doesn‚Äôt wait.‚Äù

No excuses. Rain or shine, we were either raking leaves, fixing something, or getting dragged to hardware stores before most people had even brewed coffee.

I hated it. I thought he was just obsessed with discipline, or maybe allergic to fun. I'd always ask, ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we just sleep in like normal families?‚Äù His answer never changed:

‚ÄúOwn your mornings, and the rest of the day will follow.‚Äù

It sounded like one of those phrases dads repeat just because *they* heard it from *their* dads.

Fast forward to adulthood. I had full control of my life, and I used it to sleep in every weekend. Until one day I woke up late, rushed, missed an important meeting, and spent the rest of the day playing catch-up. I felt behind, foggy, and frustrated. It wasn‚Äôt just one bad day, it kept happening.

So one Saturday, for no real reason, I got out of bed early. Made real breakfast. Took a walk. Planned my day instead of reacting to it. It felt‚Ä¶ calm. Like I was in charge of time instead of constantly chasing it.

It became a habit. And it changed everything, my focus, my energy, even my mood.

One morning, as I poured coffee before sunrise, I caught myself whispering, ‚ÄúOwn your mornings...‚Äù and laughed. I finally got it.

My dad wasn‚Äôt just making us wake up early. He was teaching us something deeper:  
**Discipline isn‚Äôt about control, it‚Äôs about freedom.**

I texted him that day:

Whether you crave the precision of espresso, the smoothness of a cappuccino, or the comfort of black coffee, these machines offer versatility, consistency, and convenience‚Äîall without the need for manual grinding or frothing.

# What Is an Automatic Coffee Machine?

An automatic coffee machine is designed to perform the entire coffee-making process with minimal user intervention. Unlike manual espresso machines, these appliances grind beans, extract espresso, and often froth milk automatically. Some models are fully automatic (bean-to-cup), while others are semi-automatic, giving users some control over the brewing steps.

# Key Features and Benefits

**1. One-Touch Operation:** Most automatic coffee machines allow users to select their favorite drink‚Äîlike latte, espresso, or macchiato‚Äîwith a single button. This is ideal for busy mornings or multitasking environments.

**2. Integrated Grinders:** These machines typically include built-in burr grinders, ensuring every brew starts with freshly ground beans. This significantly enhances flavor and aroma.

**3. Milk Frothing Systems:** Higher-end models come with automatic milk frothers or carafes. Some allow customization of froth level and temperature for various milk-based drinks.

**4. Customization:** Many machines let users adjust grind size, coffee strength, temperature, and volume, tailoring each cup to individual taste.

**5. Compact Design:** Automatic machines are increasingly space-efficient, with sleek profiles that fit modern kitchen counters and office pantries.

**6. Easy Maintenance:** Features like self-cleaning cycles, removable drip trays, and descaling alerts simplify upkeep and prolong machine lifespan.

# Who Should Use One?

**Home Users:** If you're a coffee enthusiast looking for caf√©-style drinks at home without the effort of manual brewing, an automatic machine is a great investment.

**Offices:** These machines are perfect for workplaces where staff need quick, consistent coffee with minimal downtime. Some models are designed for high-volume usage.

**Hotels & Hospitality:** Automatic coffee makers can elevate guest experience with self-service espresso bars in rooms or lobbies.

**Small Caf√©s or Bistros:** Startups or compact food businesses can benefit from entry-level professional automatic machines that balance quality with speed.

# Top Considerations Before Buying

* **Budget:** Automatic machines range from budget-friendly to premium. Prices depend on brand, build quality, and included features.
* **Drink Variety:** Ensure the model supports your preferred beverages.
* **Water and Bean Capacity:** Choose larger capacities for high-use scenarios.
* **User Interface:** Look for touchscreen panels or clearly labeled buttons for easy navigation.
* **Brand Reputation:** Brands like DeLonghi, Jura, Philips, and Breville offer proven reliability.

# Final Thoughts

An [automatic coffee machine](https://latteholic.com/) can significantly upgrade your coffee routine, blending automation with premium quality. It's the perfect solution for those who want great-tasting coffee without the barista skill set. With a wide variety of models and features, there‚Äôs an option for every lifestyle and budget. Whether for home indulgence or workplace efficiency, an automatic coffee machine is a smart, satisfying choice for modern coffee lovers.",1,1753153233.0,u_CalligrapherDue4835,0,1.0,False

ive been vegetarian for around two years now, but i wanted to go vegan mainly for the animals and the cruelty they face, but also for my own health. i‚Äôve been doing a lot of research and ive learned how veganism can do a whole 180 on a persons health, including fixing their gut biome and weight loss. 

i was in hyvee today (i don‚Äôt normally shop there but i wanted to try vegan cream cheese for a recipe) and i was blown away by all of the plant based dairy and egg alternatives! literally anything you could think of has an alternative - sour cream, yogurt, spinach artichoke dip and sour cream and onion dip, cheese sticks, even kraft now has a vegan mac n cheese, there‚Äôs so much! now to me, this sounds great, however, i wonder if this may actually be counterintuitive to a vegan diet. i‚Äôve heard some people say that those dairy alternatives have bad ingredients in them, so if you‚Äôre vegan it‚Äôs better to just cut dairy and eggs completely from your diet instead of eating the ‚Äúfake‚Äù stuff. however, plant based milks are extremely popular even to non vegans, you can find oat milk in any coffee shop, so what‚Äôs the difference?

1m62ylp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1m62ylp/trying_to_call_out_of_work_without_getting_in/,Trying to call out of work without getting in trouble,"I recently started working at a coffee house that was better than the previous one I worked at. I have worked at one for 4 years and decided to transition to a new store that opened up, because they provided benefits and had better opportunities overall. However this new store is a lot more strict, and while I‚Äôm trying to adjust to the stricter policies and be a good worker, I‚Äôve been having a rough start that has been making it difficult and portraying me in a bad light.

Unfortunately there is one particular person who I don‚Äôt have good standing with, because every time I see her, she points out something about me that is wrong and always seems like there is some kind of issue. 

For some context on why I‚Äôm stressed about calling out- I had recently cut my hours to two days a week for a whole month because my long distant boyfriend was visiting me. Yesterday he had to leave back home, but unfortunately I was scheduled to work before he had to leave. I wanted to see him off and say my goodbyes, so I asked the manager if I could come into work at a later time. Approximately two hours later because I didn‚Äôt want to call out. I had given her a short rundown on why, and asked her early morning, hours before my shift to give her plenty of time to think on it. She told me to ask two people that were already working if they could stay until 5-5:30 to cover my absence, and if they can‚Äôt, I would have to come in around 3:45 (my shift was 2:30) and ask my shift supervisor (the person I‚Äôm having troubles with) to see if she‚Äôs okay with it. 

So I did exactly that. However, I felt no one would be willing to stay until 5, so I asked both people if they could stay until at least 4. Only one got back to me saying they were there until 4:30 and will see me later. So I figured that worked out and was settled. 8 min after my shift was suppose to start, my shift supervisor starts texting me asking me where I am, and that I‚Äôm suppose to call the store if I‚Äôm running late. I apologized for not texting her about my situation, and explained that I was coming in later and why. She started interrogating me asking if this was okay with my manager, who I asked, if they agreed, and if she knows. I told her everything that was said to me, and she told me to come in as soon as possible because the girl I had asked to cover was already scheduled until 4:30 so its not considered a coverage. I was upset about it clearly, but I had no choice, so I wasn‚Äôt able to properly say goodbye to my bf, and went into work. I got in trouble for it, and was told my manager was gonna have a talk with me about it, which in their words is mostly likely a write up.

Now after all that tension from yesterday, I had just saw that I was scheduled on a day thats not within my availability. I work weekends and Mondays and Tuesdays, and give myself 3 consecutive days off. They scheduled me on a Thursday for a store meeting, which unfortunately I can‚Äôt attend because I‚Äôm going on a family trip in which I wont be back until Friday. 

I need to call off, but I don‚Äôt know how to approach it. I wanted to send a message to my manager explaining the issue as to why I can‚Äôt show up for that shift, but my family is telling me not to and to just call out sick the day of. They believe that after everything thats been happening in the work place and all the trouble I‚Äôve been getting into, that trying to explain anything to my superiors is futile and they will just see me as a flake. However I like to be as transparent as possible just so I don‚Äôt appear that way. I rarely call off and I try to find a common ground every time I‚Äôm in a situation like this but so far it seems to have backfired on me.

By the fire of the longhouse, in the ninth year of √ì√∞inn‚Äôs moon, 2025...

In the twilight of spring, as the sun dipped low behind the fjord-cut skyline, the people of Valt√Ωrstad prepared for the Ninth Night. Skalds chalked bindrunes on the walls of coffee houses. Motorbikes rumbled past statues of Thor and Freyja, their riders clad not in chrome studded leather, but in wolf pelts and woven cloaks. Even in the heart of the modern city, gods were everywhere: etched in steel, reflected in glass, whispered in alleyways.

On the edge of the city stood a longhouse that hummed with electric warmth and old magic. Cedar smoke curled from its chimney. Inside, a child named Sigr√∫n sat with her grandfather, a go√∞i with silver braids and storm grey eyes. Tonight, she would take her first climb. Tonight, she would seek her hamr.

‚ÄúDo you know why we do this?‚Äù her grandfather asked, adjusting the runes on her cloak.

Sigr√∫n nodded. ‚ÄúBecause we are not just skin and name. We are shadow and echo. We are more than we seem.‚Äù

He smiled. ‚ÄúGood. Then you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù

Outside, the streets had quieted. On the Ninth Night, no one worked, no one traded. The government, such as it was, paused. Even the sky respected the silence. It was the one night when all honored the crossing: between who you are and who you are meant to be.

Sigr√∫n joined the others at the foot of the mountain. Her classmates. Her rival. Her brother. Each wore a cloak marked by their clan‚Äôs rune. No two were the same. Drums began to beat from above; soft, steady, ancestral. A path of flame lit stones led upward.

They climbed.

At the summit stood the v√©, the sacred space. No walls. Just open air, stone pillars, and the bones of memory. The go√∞ar encircled the youth. A v√∂lva stood at the center, her staff carved from lightning-struck ash.

‚ÄúStep forward,‚Äù she called.

One by one, the young did. Each spoke their heiti, the name they claimed. Not the one given by their parents, but the one earned by spirit. ‚ÄúSigr√∫n √∫lfrbl√≥√∞.‚Äù Sigr√∫n of the wolf-blood.

The v√∂lva nodded. ‚ÄúTonight, your hamr will walk.‚Äù

The youth knelt. The drums shifted. The chanting began, not in English, not in Nynorsk, but in the Old Tongue. The rhythm seeped into Sigr√∫n‚Äôs bones. Her breath slowed. Her skin prickled. And then...

She was no longer kneeling.

She was running.

Through forest, moonlit and silver. Her body low, her paws silent. She knew every scent. She heard the heartbeat of mice underground. She leapt between stones like wind given form. She was not human. She was not other. She was wolf.

And then, she howled.

Not in fear. Not in rage. But in joy.

Below, the city pulsed with ritual. Families gathered around altars of stone and steel. Drones passed overhead, filming for the great moot broadcast. Atop skyscrapers, rune-priests poured mead into rooftop bowls. Freyr‚Äôs gardens bloomed on balconies. Freyja‚Äôs cats curled on digital hearths. Thor‚Äôs hammers hung in truck windows and subway stations. No one forgot the gods, they lived among them.

In schools, children learned Old Norse beside math and science. They recited H√°vam√°l with as much fluency as Shakespeare. Runes were as common as alphabets. Magic was not hidden, it was regulated, respected, recorded.

Hospitals employed v√∂lur to sing healing over the dying. Police bore carved staves to ward off vengeful spirits. Soldiers trained in combat and in prophecy. Politicians swore oaths on oath rings, and breaking one meant exile, not reelection.

This was not a utopia. There was still struggle. Still greed, still pain. But there was balance. There was memory. The old ways had not been lost. They had grown roots in concrete and glass.

When Sigr√∫n awoke, she lay in her grandfather‚Äôs arms.

‚ÄúDid you find it?‚Äù he whispered.

She nodded, tears streaking her ash stained cheeks. ‚ÄúI was not alone.‚Äù

He smiled, and lifted her up to face the stars.

‚ÄúThen you are truly among us now. A daughter of wolves. A keeper of the Old Flame.‚Äù

And somewhere, beyond the fjord and the neon skyline, a chorus of howls answered; soft, strong, eternal.

TW graphic details, transphoba

I am a transgender man. In the past year, I have been raped/assaulted by 2 transgender women, who were close friends of mine, as well as been repeatedly sexually harassed. I feel like an awful person for even saying this out loud. I love each and every one of my trans siblings, but i find myself lately having an avoidance to trans women, and I think I may be a horrible person. 

The first time was my girlfriend of 5 years. We were taking a shower in the morning, and she started to touch me, which was fine and normal. Then she started groping me, I laughed and said I wasn't really in the mood. She spun me around and penetrated me, multiple times I pulled her off and said ""stop"" or ""I'm done"", but she just grabbed me and held me against the shower and continued. At some point she stopped after I had asked at least ten times. I left the shower then and sat on the bed, and asked dissociated for hours in silence. Later that day, I asked if she had heard me asking her to stop. She just shrugged and said ""yeah"" and walked off. 

The second time was a close friend of mine. We had hooked up twice before, I struggle with boundaries (clearly), but I've been crystal clear with her that I was in a bad place and wanted to remain celibate. We had a bad night out with other friends, and I didn't end up bringing her back home until about 3am. She said I could crash at hers, and I was vocal about being hesitant because I didn't want to have sex. She assured me it would be fine.

I was falling asleep and rubbing her arm, then she came onto me and starting rubbing in between my legs. I told her I didnt want to have sex, but she continued anyway, and I should have done more to stop her but I was on 48 straight hours of no sleep. We had sex, and a couple times I said again I didnt want to but eventually just gave up. At one point she said she liked how tight I was because I was scared. 

I stopped going to one of the only trans meetups in my town, at a coffee shop. There is a lot of discourse and im really the only trans guy and whatnot, but on multiple occasions trans women have come up to me asking about my chest size. Twice a girl has grabbed my crotch unprompted ""to see if you had a dick or not"". I've gotten so many comments about my bra size and having a ""bonus hole"". 

I'm just at the point where I am so massively uncomfortable around women and I feel so, so guilty. I think im doing something wrong for this to keep happening but im not sure what. I know it's just my small range of experience, and I don't ever ever want to subconsciously assign such horrible thoughts to people, but I am wary and scared, and I think I'm a horrible person. I feel so disgusting in my body.

Not because I wanted to sound smart at parties. My college roommate (philosophy major) told me that's what the ancient Stoics did they read every morning to train their minds. Idk if that was even true.

**How to Start (If You Haven't Read a Book Since High School):**

* Pick something you're genuinely curious about. Not what you think you ""should"" read. Curious about money? Read ""Rich Dad Poor Dad."" Into psychology? Try ""Thinking, Fast and Slow."" Love stories? Pick up fiction that actually makes you think.
* Start with 10 pages. Not 50. Not ""I'll read for an hour."" Just 10 pages. Every morning. Before you touch your phone just read.
* Physical books only (at least at first). Your phone has trained you to skim and jump around. Books train you to go deep.
* Keep it visible. Put the book next to your bed. On your coffee table. Make it easier to grab than your phone.

Your attention span gets longer. Your thoughts get clearer. You start seeing patterns everywhere because you're feeding your brain actual substance instead of digital candy.

**But here's where people screw it up:**

1. They try it once, get bored, and quit. Yeah no shit it feels slow at first. Your brain is used to getting dopamine hits every 3 seconds. It's supposed to feel weird. Give it two weeks. Minimum.
2. They ease into it. Start with audiobooks or short articles. Nope. Pick up a real book. Physical pages. Make your brain do the work. Get the real effect of focused, sustained attention.
3. They treat it like homework. It's not a chore. It's mental strength training. Don't just ""get through pages"" lean into the ideas. Make it a daily win.

After 4 years:

* My attention span went from goldfish to laser-focused
* I stopped falling for clickbait and surface-level thinking
* Conversations got deeper because I had actual thoughts, not just reactions
* Problems started looking like puzzles instead of disasters
* I became the guy people come to for advice

Still reading. Still sometimes feels like work. Still doing it. I think it's flipped my relationship with discipline, because in the end, not being disciplined means you stop once it requires effort.

Try it tomorrow. No thinking. Just grab a book and read 10 pages. Let me know how it hits your brain differently than scrolling. And start with something you're actually interested in curiosity beats discipline.

So, I am great at problem solving and thinking on my feet (from what others have told me). I live with diagnoses that, while negatively impacting other parts of my life, help me remain calm and composed in situations where most people around me would start to unravel. People often describe me as ""unflappable"", I would use it as an icebreaker adjective if my name started with u as well.

Last week, I was talking to a friend and mentioned how my Monday had started terribly. I slept through my alarm, was running late for the second week at my new job, and didn't have time to grab breakfast (or even coffee). This friend has known me for a while, and they are aware of how religiously I follow my routines. Still, I was able to think on my feet and time things perfectly, so I could have breakfast before setting foot in my office with next to no disruption to the rest of my routine. Their response to it got me thinking about how I have been able to think on my feet to creatively solve other problems too, not just my own, but also problems of people around me.

That makes me think, there are people around me who freeze and get stuck on problems for a plethora of reasons. I am not referring to significant issues like debt or health. I am referring to minor inconveniences that disrupt people's flow and the norm they have established for themselves, ultimately derailing the rest of their day. So, what if I were to launch something to help people get their days back on track, or otherwise minimise the impact these inconveniences have on their lives?

I came across a news article from the BBC that caught my attention: ‚ÄúAn air force jet has crashed in Bangladesh,‚Äù resulting in the deaths of at least 20 people and injuring over 170 others. The incident occurred when a training jet from the Bangladeshi Air Force crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, the capital. The armed forces issued a statement on Facebook saying that the F-7 jet experienced mechanical failure shortly after taking off for a training mission around 1:00 PM local time (07:06 GMT) on Monday. Sadly, the pilot was among those who died.

I then turned to YouTube to find videos related to this incident and to hear comments from Bengalis about the situation. Honestly, I think Bangladesh is becoming increasingly embarrassing. I‚Äôve met many Bengalis in NYC who feel Bangladesh is a joke and a place for looting, and they believe that Western Europe and American masters will send foreign aid to Bangladesh, allowing them to exploit those resources. Some call it a recycling of money, which flows from Western Europe and America, and then they use it to buy houses, cars, and start businesses in Western Europe and America.

They often don‚Äôt understand the complexities involved in forming a strategic foreign policy. Interestingly, Bengalis‚Äô Father Mujib, who openly admitted to begging for financial help from the world to support Bangladesh, suggests that some Bengalis stole such funds.

My father advised General Osmani to form a professional military before the Indian withdrawal on March 14, 1972, but Sheikh Mujibur Rahman opposed this, claiming, ""We have no enemy; we do not need an army,"" and instead proposed creating Rakkhi Bahini for civil defense. After setting up Bangladesh‚Äôs military, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi discussed with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who emphasized the need to build a military to appease the Razakars and support national security.

Bangladesh‚Äôs armed forces‚ÄîArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR)‚Äîtrace their roots back to remnants of the Pakistani military, including the Army, Navy, Air Force, as well as East Pakistan Rangers and Razakars. Many believe all Mukti Bahini members joined the new military, but in reality, the group was diverse, and many members faced severe losses during coups, counter-coups, courts-martial, and gang conflicts, which complicated nation-building.

Different leaders envisioned the military‚Äôs future differently: Serajul Alam Khan supported Gonobahini, Khaled Mosharraf favored a Confederate Army, and Colonel Taher pushed for a Red Army. These divisions reflected internal conflicts, and none of these leaders were solely focused on Bengali nationalism.

**Bangladesh Air Force**

I heard that MAG Osmani had a conversation with my father at a coffee table where he asked how we would build an Air Force, considering we had nothing left after the Indian military took everything as war booty. My father recalled that Valentin Popov, the Soviet Union's Ambassador to Bangladesh, was the first high-ranking official to visit the country. He advised MAG Osmani to say nothing and just observe what Valentin Popov was doing. My father suggested that Popov might believe the Purbo Banglar Communist Party would declare communism, and he would try to support Mujib to avoid any problems or another war with communists. He noted that the Soviet Union would probably help Bangladesh support a communist revolution.

My father‚Äôs prediction came true when, in November‚ÄìDecember 1972, the Bangladesh Air Force received a large donation from the Soviet Union. Among the aircraft delivered were ten single-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21MFs, two twin-seat Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21UMs, and twelve Mil Mi-8 utility helicopters. Later, China also supplied some equipment. This marked the start of the Bangladesh Air Force.

**Nation of Thieves**

I have consistently advised and taught some Bangladesh ministers how to build foreign relationships and develop the country. I recommended creating institutions that improve quality of life by fostering good governance and improving infrastructure in Bangladesh; however, instead of developing, they loot the country.

During Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina‚Äôs time in office, about 240 billion dollars were stolen from Bangladesh. A committee formed by interim leader Muhammad Yunus revealed concerning findings about the country‚Äôs finances. According to the committee, it‚Äôs estimated that an average of $16 billion may have been illegally taken out of Bangladesh each year during Hasina‚Äôs 15-year rule.

The panel, led by economist Debapriya Bhattacharya, submitted a white paper on Bangladesh's economy to Dr. Yunus, as announced by the government.

1m62j8t,https://i.redd.it/jdv7kzvg1cef1.jpeg,The Toasted Marshmallow Coffee Syrup Hooch (it tastes like burning),"A friend gave me a bottle of Da Vinci Toasted Marshmallow coffee syrup. It tasted like burned coconut (not marshmallows, strangely), and it had both potassium sorbate and sodium benzoate in it. I diluted it with water to make a half-gallon, and boiled it on the stove for a bit in an attempt to destroy some of the preservatives. I usually dry-pitch, but this time I actually bothered starting the 1118, because I knew it was gonna need all the help it could get. It also got a dash of DAP to help it along.

Fermentation was not exactly vigorous, but the 1118 still managed 5.8% ABV in two weeks. That was the only good news.

The hooch was awful. That shit went right proper acrid. Tasting notes included Harbor Freight tools and burning powder coat.

I distilled it, hoping the flavor would stay behind. It did not. I now have about a pint of perfectly clear 43% ABV rotgut that tastes like a toasted marshmallow jelly bean wrapped in an electrical fire. 

So, yeah. Garbage in, garbage out. But now I know that 1118 can eat this garbage, I'll have to keep an eye out for a less-wretched flavor of it on the clearance rack.

We are both autistic, but could not be more different. I‚Äôm expressive and highly overtly emotional. High masking. He is low masking and has very flat affect and doesn‚Äôt often express how he feels. We met in college and then he moved away. 

When he first moved away we would play computer games together and end up talking for hours and hours, sometimes until 1am. When we used to do these calls on discord, when he first moved away, he told me about a girl he liked, and how they never got together. Because of this, I pushed dating him out of my mind. We don‚Äôt play that game anymore though.

Now we see each other every few months, when he comes back to visit. He always reaches out and asks me to hang out - willing to accommodate my schedule and also willing to meet spontaneously. It used to be movies, but he started suggesting that we do activities or get coffee so we can talk. We have been sharing a lot more things with each other and getting to know each other better.  But I don‚Äôt know if I should hope for more than platonic.

When we text, I feel like I want to talk to him way more than he does me. I want to text him a lot, and end up reaching out more. He has been reaching out more, but doesn‚Äôt always continue a conversation once the first conversation topic has ended. Outside of him messaging to tell me he is in town, I definitely text first more frequently, and feel like I do more work to keep the conversation going. He leaves me on delivered/read a lot ‚Äî we don‚Äôt have read receipts but he just kinda stops responding sometimes, even though I don‚Äôt feel like the conversation is over. I‚Äôm not mad at him, just observation. Maybe just different perception of the conversation 

I‚Äôve never met anyone like him. He is kind, patient, never condescending even when I don‚Äôt know something that seems obvious to him. He is kind, patient, and shows me that he cares for me in his own way. I love his mindset and outlook and the way his brain works. 

I am scared to even hope, I don‚Äôt know how to read the texting thing.

I (24F) had a really intense falling out with my (ex?) best friend, we will call her M (24F) after a night out and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm truly in the wrong here, or if I‚Äôm being gaslit into thinking I am.

For context: 
M and I have been friends for roughly 6 years. There‚Äôs this running tendency with M where she says one thing to my face but really she means something else and then later, she blows up about it. She doesn‚Äôt communicate her true feelings when something is bothering her in the moment. Instead, she waits until it‚Äôs built up and then lets everything out at once ‚Äî and I end up hit with all of it, even when she told me we were fine. Also in the past, when M has met a guy on a night out and wanted to hook up, I‚Äôve been really supportive. I‚Äôve even gone as far as waiting in a guy‚Äôs lounge room while shes hooking up with someone.
It‚Äôs also important to note, we share each others locations (this is important for later).

So, I drove 6 hours to see her, I got there on Friday.
Saturday night, we were going out (M, M‚Äôs sister and I) and we agreed it was a ‚Äúgirls‚Äô night.‚Äù No one said ‚Äúno hookups,‚Äù just that we‚Äôd stick together and have fun. We went clubbing. I met a guy I vibed with and started dancing with him. Later, M and her sister (22F) decided to go to another club with some guy who had a VIP booth and free ‚ùÑÔ∏è. I asked if the guy I was with could come ‚Äî she said yes, but that he couldn‚Äôt come into the booth. That was totally fine with me, and I said I‚Äôd just do my own thing with him while they enjoyed the booth.

We were in the new club for 20 minutes max. When I checked my phone, I had missed calls and texts. I rang them back instantly. They‚Äôd already left for another club. I left immediately to meet them.

When I got there, the mood had shifted. M was upset I‚Äôd ‚Äúleft‚Äù her and not answered my phone sooner. We were all drinking and things got heated ‚Äî we both raised our voices. I admit I raised my voice more than her. I did also yell at her sister too. The music was loud, I was drunk, and things were just chaotic, but I own that I got louder and did wrong there. When M raised her voice at me, I couldn‚Äôt handle it and walked away. I know that‚Äôs not the best way to deal with conflict, but that‚Äôs a flaw I recognize in myself. Her sister wasn‚Äôt happy with me either, and I felt totally ganged up on. It felt like I was being backed into a corner, and there was no way for me to make things right. What really hurt though, is that once I realised that walking away wasn‚Äôt the right thing to do, she wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls or texts. I tried so hard to get back in touch and make things right, but she just ignored me completely. She left me alone in a city, with a guy I‚Äôd just met at 2am. 

The guy I met offered to let me crash at his place. He seemed kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel safe sleeping on the street or driving home, so I accepted.
I messaged M offering to meet her numerous times ‚Äî she told me to stay with him. So I did.

The next morning, I got coffee and pastries and went to her house, woke her up gently, and we talked for over an hour. We both apologised, admitted we were wrong, said we felt good about our conversation and had worked through it.

Later that day, the guy I met asked me to lunch. I asked Maddy 2 separate times if she was okay with that. She said yes, she even helped me pick my outfit. Lunch went long (longer than expected) and I decided not to drive six hours home that late, so I stayed over at his again.

That night, M texted me out of nowhere, the most horrific message I‚Äôve ever received, saying I‚Äôm rude, a narcissist, selfish, and a bad friend (I‚Äôll paste that in the comments if people want context). She ended the friendship over text. I called numerous times, confused and hurt. No answer. M blocked me. I went to her house to try and talk ‚Äî I pressed her buzzer for a long time, just trying to get her to come and speak to me face-to-face instead of hiding behind a screen. I was ringing her repeatedly, but she wasn‚Äôt answering. Instead of coming to talk to me, she sent her ex-boyfriend out to talk to me (which I found really cowardly) and both he and M threatened to call the police if I didn‚Äôt leave. Now I want you to note, during my time at her house I was remaining as calm as possible, I hadn‚Äôt raised my voice at all. She knows I have trauma relating to the police. She knows I have extreme abandonment issues. She knew exactly what she was doing. With threatening to call the police and what she said in that text, breaking up the friendship with me over iMessage. She knew this was the worst possible thing she could do to me.

That message was so hurtful. I can‚Äôt even describe how much it stung. She knew it would hit me in the most painful places. The way she lashed out, with everything I had confided in her about my past‚Ä¶ I feel like she weaponized it against me. I don‚Äôt understand how she could do that after everything we‚Äôve been through.

I know I may have made a mistake by splitting off during girls‚Äô night, but I did ask permission before doing anything ‚Äî every step of the way. I also know I shouldn‚Äôt have raised my voice but I thought we were okay. I thought we‚Äôd moved on after our lengthy conversation on Sunday morning. But now I‚Äôm being told I‚Äôm a horrible person, a narcissist, and worse ‚Äî and I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know anymore. 

Please also note I have a really hard time remembering all the intricate details of this as I have memory issues from childhood trauma, but I‚Äôve tried to include as much as I can possibly remember.

Menopause hit me hard, and I began experiencing some real health issues. I found a Doctor Who specializes in women‚Äôs health, and after a 24 hour hormone test, she recommended hormone therapy.

Recent studies show that hormone therapy is safe and in some research it indicates that it‚Äôs especially affected between the ages 45‚Äì55 when you‚Äôre in perimenopause/menopause (it‚Äôs important to do your own research and speak with a qualified doctor). Before beginning, my doctor asked if I had consistent, daily bowel movements. I said no.

She immediately asked if I drink coffee. I don‚Äôt live in Utah, so she wasn‚Äôt thinking about this from a religious context, she was purely looking at it from a health standpoint. Since it wasn‚Äôt part of my family‚Äôs LDS culture and I had never developed a taste for it. I simply told her ‚Äúno‚Äù. She explained that coffee could help regulate my bowel movements and help with digestion, so she asked if I was open to trying it because she couldn‚Äôt recommend hormone therapy until this issue was resolved.

So I did. And now? I love my morning cup and my afternoon decaf! More importantly, it worked! Coffee helped regulate my bowel movements, which allowed me to start hormone therapy. With that and a few more dietary changes, many of my symptoms have improved or disappeared!

What surprised me most is how something so simple can make such a big difference. Coffee has a lot of health benefits (as long as you don‚Äôt overload it with sugar and turn into a dessert!) My doctor backs everything with science-based research and coffee and especially tea have many health benefits. It‚Äôs wild that I grew up thinking coffee was ‚Äúbad/evil‚Äú, when it was one of the most natural and helpful things I could‚Äôve added to my routine. So much for spending my childhood being taught ‚Äúone day it will be proven to be unhealthy‚Äú JS is a prophet of God blah blah blah!

Anyway, just wanted to share my coffee/health journey. The idea that coffee and tea needed to be linked to one‚Äôs worthiness is so wrong on so many levels, it just boggles my mind!",34,1753151356.0,exmormon,17,1.0,False

My husband is lovely and does so many things for me, I genuinely appreciate him and all he does. However a consistent issue keeps coming up that I have no idea how to handle.

Right now, he's not been able to find a job, so I work from home and support both of us. This morning we did not have any milk for coffee and I didn't have time to go to the store before work started, so I asked if he could get some. He goes ""nah"" and laughs - and I know in his head it's funny because he will go get some, so I leave him to it. 

It is now halfway through my work day. I ask him again. He goes ""No."". I say, ""Do you actually mean that..?"" and I get a snippy ""I'll go in a minute"". I told him please don't get angry at me, I genuinely don't understand what you mean. 

This has come up before, and I've told him I don't care about him saying it jokingly \*and then doing it\*. I do the same, it's a stupid funny thing. But he regularly says no - not ""Oh let me wake up first but I'll go in an hour"" or ""No sorry I'm about to go do thing so I can't"" - just ""No."" and then, crucially, does not do whatever it is. 

It hurts my feelings. If you are not going to do it, I deserve better than a gruff ""no"". If I can't do something he asks I will tell him why. I know he genuinely means to do whatever I've asked, but at this point it's fairly regularly just ""no"" and then doesn't happen. We've talked about it before and then he's good about it for a while.... And then it slowly starts back again.

    Me and my wife have been married for around 9 years now. We have a daughter who is seven, and a younger daughter who is five. They're super needy. The older one has major adhd, let's call her Lilly for this story. Lilly constantly needs stimulation. The only thing that stops her is medication, but those meds made her gain a ton of weight, where she was obese by age 4 and is still extremely overweight to this day. 
    Her health complications started the fights with my wife. She said I need to start taking initiative to get lilly exercising, but the problem is that I'm working a lot of overtime to pay for the kids. My wife doesn't meet eye to eye with my constant overtime and gruelling work schedule. My wife only works part time, so she has plenty of time to to take care of the kids. 
     My youngest, all she does is cry. My wife doesn't do anything to calm her down. We argue, I say our daughter needs to grow up and stop crying over every single minor inconvenience. She has the most ear piercing scream ever. 
     My wife has gotten extremely lazy since the youngest was born. When she's not working, she's sitting on the couch, eating potato chips and watching Netflix. She's gotten even fatter, gaining around 200 lbs since our second was born. I just don't find her attractive anymore, she doesn't do anything a self proclaimed ""half time stay at home"" mother and wife should be doing. I do everything, I cook, I clean, I take care of them kids, and I work so much so I have very little down time. 
     I was getting so tired of being around my poor excuse of a family, so the few days I didn't work, I would just get in my car and drive around and go to cafes and such. I wouldn't tell my wife any of this. I met another woman at a coffee shop. Shes beautiful, thin, kind, caring. None of what my wife is. This woman, let's call her Clara. She's the most perfect lady ever. I started spending so much time with her, I would take days off of work just to go with her. Id tell my wife that I'm spending the night at my brother's house and watching sports with him, but I would really go to claras. 
    Doing the deed with Clara is just so perfect. My wife never wanted to do it with me for years. I have no desire to do it with her lardy blob of a body either. 
    Long story short, the wife found out about Clara. She said I've destroyed her. But recently, I found a profile of hers on a dating app, using old pictures from when she wasn't a blob. I showed this to her, and she says it's because I'm a failed husband. I personally think I had a reason to cheat, but she didn't. She doesn't do what a wife should at all, and I need my needs met.

Like, I used to be that person who could chat with anyone about anything. Grocery store checkout lines, elevators, waiting rooms - I'd find a way to strike up a conversation. I thought that's just who I was, you know? The friendly, outgoing type who made awkward situations less awkward by filling the silence.

But recently I caught myself at a coffee shop, and this woman next to me was clearly trying to start a conversation about the weather. Old me would have jumped right in, probably ended up learning her life story and exchanging numbers. Current me? I just smiled politely, nodded, and went back to my book. Not because I was being unfriendly - I just genuinely didn't feel like having that conversation.

It's weird because I didn't consciously decide to change. There was no moment where I was like ""okay, from now on I'm going to be more reserved."" It just gradually shifted. Maybe it was spending so much time alone during lockdown, or maybe I just got more comfortable with who I actually am versus who I thought I should be.

My friend sent me a shirt last week that just said ""Energized by Silence"" in plain white text on black. I think they used some weird AI site that generates hyper-specific slogans based on your vibe or whatever. But it hit weirdly close to home. Like, yeah, that's exactly what happened to me. Silence stopped feeling like something I needed to fix.

I'm not antisocial now or anything. I still love deep conversations with people I care about. But those surface-level ""how's the weather"" exchanges that used to feel natural now feel less appealing. Like I only have so much social energy and I want to spend it on conversations that actually connect with people.

The interesting thing is, some people in my life have noticed the shift. My mom keeps asking if everything's okay because I don't chat with every cashier anymore. But honestly? I feel more authentic than I have in years. Turns out I was doing a lot of talking just because I thought I was supposed to, not because I actually wanted to.

Have you ever noticed a quiet shift in your personality that even surprised you? Like you woke up one day and realized you'd been operating differently for months without really thinking about it?

I'm curious if this is just a me thing or if other people have had these subtle evolutions too. Sometimes I wonder if we all just slowly become more ourselves as we get older, discovering the parts of our personalities that feel most genuine.",5,1753150888.0,CasualConversation,9,1.0,False

Do I crave community or convenience or peace or something else entirely. At a crossroads and trying to figure it out.

  
So, for context I'm in my mid-30's and the foundational parts of my life (job, relationships, home) are all good. And I'm lucky enough to have quite a bit of free time on my hands. 

Right now I live in the country in a small town and there is just NOTHING to do here. I'm not a church, volunteer, kids, get a second job sort of person. Those things are not going to happen.

I find myself craving being closer to a city so I'd have more options to get involved in the arts or music or just plain go out in public for coffee and shopping or something. However, I do value the peace that comes with being in the country. Living in the inner city is not something I want to do. I crave being around people, but I also don't like most of them that I meet, so it feels like a catch-22.

I think I'd like to be able to do things without having to drive an hour one way to do them. But I'm having a hard time pinning down exactly what I want. Convenience is nice and having more options for outings is wonderful. And having some community in my life sounds nice too. But out here in the sticks, everyone is a religious zealot repub and that's (frankly) a good way for me to get hate-crimed (I'm lgbt). In the city I'd find more people like me, but I have to trade my trees and peace for it.

IDK if I'm just doing a mid-life thing or what, but it's been really hard to figure out what I'm willing to give up and what I want to gain. I feel like I'm at that age where people start choosing a place to stay for a long time, but I've never lived in one place for longer than 5 years in my life (divorced parents). So it's odd to me to just settle down and never move again, especially in today's world.

I (24F) had a really intense falling out with my (ex?) best friend, we will call her M (24F) after a night out and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm truly in the wrong here, or if I‚Äôm being gaslit into thinking I am.

For context: 
M and I have been friends for roughly 6 years. There‚Äôs this running tendency with M where she says one thing to my face but really she means something else and then later, she blows up about it. She doesn‚Äôt communicate her true feelings when something is bothering her in the moment. Instead, she waits until it‚Äôs built up and then lets everything out at once ‚Äî and I end up hit with all of it, even when she told me we were fine. Also in the past, when M has met a guy on a night out and wanted to hook up, I‚Äôve been really supportive. I‚Äôve even gone as far as waiting in a guy‚Äôs lounge room while shes hooking up with someone.
It‚Äôs also important to note, we share each others locations (this is important for later).

So, I drove 6 hours to see her, I got there on Friday.
Saturday night, we were going out (M, M‚Äôs sister and I) and we agreed it was a ‚Äúgirls‚Äô night.‚Äù No one said ‚Äúno hookups,‚Äù just that we‚Äôd stick together and have fun. We went clubbing. I met a guy I vibed with and started dancing with him. Later, M and her sister (22F) decided to go to another club with some guy who had a VIP booth and free ‚ùÑÔ∏è. I asked if the guy I was with could come ‚Äî she said yes, but that he couldn‚Äôt come into the booth. That was totally fine with me, and I said I‚Äôd just do my own thing with him while they enjoyed the booth.

We were in the new club for 20 minutes max. When I checked my phone, I had missed calls and texts. I rang them back instantly. They‚Äôd already left for another club. I left immediately to meet them.

When I got there, the mood had shifted. M was upset I‚Äôd ‚Äúleft‚Äù her and not answered my phone sooner. We were all drinking and things got heated ‚Äî we both raised our voices. I admit I raised my voice more than her. I did also yell at her sister too. The music was loud, I was drunk, and things were just chaotic, but I own that I got louder and did wrong there. When M raised her voice at me, I couldn‚Äôt handle it and walked away. I know that‚Äôs not the best way to deal with conflict, but that‚Äôs a flaw I recognize in myself. Her sister wasn‚Äôt happy with me either, and I felt totally ganged up on. It felt like I was being backed into a corner, and there was no way for me to make things right. What really hurt though, is that once I realised that walking away wasn‚Äôt the right thing to do, she wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls or texts. I tried so hard to get back in touch and make things right, but she just ignored me completely. She left me alone in a city, with a guy I‚Äôd just met at 2am. 

The guy I met offered to let me crash at his place. He seemed kind, and I didn‚Äôt feel safe sleeping on the street or driving home, so I accepted.
I messaged M offering to meet her numerous times ‚Äî she told me to stay with him. So I did.

The next morning, I got coffee and pastries and went to her house, woke her up gently, and we talked for over an hour. We both apologised, admitted we were wrong, said we felt good about our conversation and had worked through it.

Later that day, the guy I met asked me to lunch. I asked Maddy 2 separate times if she was okay with that. She said yes, she even helped me pick my outfit. Lunch went long (longer than expected) and I decided not to drive six hours home that late, so I stayed over at his again.

That night, M texted me out of nowhere, the most horrific message I‚Äôve ever received, saying I‚Äôm rude, a narcissist, selfish, and a bad friend (I‚Äôll paste that in the comments if people want context). She ended the friendship over text. I called numerous times, confused and hurt. No answer. M blocked me. I went to her house to try and talk ‚Äî I pressed her buzzer for a long time, just trying to get her to come and speak to me face-to-face instead of hiding behind a screen. I was ringing her repeatedly, but she wasn‚Äôt answering. Instead of coming to talk to me, she sent her ex-boyfriend out to talk to me (which I found really cowardly) and both he and M threatened to call the police if I didn‚Äôt leave. Now I want you to note, during my time at her house I was remaining as calm as possible, I hadn‚Äôt raised my voice at all. She knows I have trauma relating to the police. She knows I have extreme abandonment issues. She knew exactly what she was doing. With threatening to call the police and what she said in that text, breaking up the friendship with me over iMessage. She knew this was the worst possible thing she could do to me.

That message was so hurtful. I can‚Äôt even describe how much it stung. She knew it would hit me in the most painful places. The way she lashed out, with everything I had confided in her about my past‚Ä¶ I feel like she weaponized it against me. I don‚Äôt understand how she could do that after everything we‚Äôve been through.

I know I may have made a mistake by splitting off during girls‚Äô night, but I did ask permission before doing anything ‚Äî every step of the way. I also know I shouldn‚Äôt have raised my voice but I thought we were okay. I thought we‚Äôd moved on after our lengthy conversation on Sunday morning. But now I‚Äôm being told I‚Äôm a horrible person, a narcissist, and worse ‚Äî and I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt know anymore. 

Please also note I have a really hard time remembering all the intricate details of this as I have memory issues from childhood trauma, but I‚Äôve tried to include as much as I can possibly remember.

Hence, due to my own uneagerness, and incompetence, I did not really learnt of the housework, unfortunately.

But then I moved for university, and the university had it's accommodations for it, by some magical endeavors I met my girlfriend, we instead vibed off, and I really liked her, then after few months, I asked her for coffee, she said ""yes"" and it went good afterwards too.

After few months, she said that she was living in a flat with a roommate, and roommate wanted to move out because of his personal reasons, she asked if I wanted to join? After some thinking, I thought it was not a good idea, so, after few minor complications, I moved there.

The problem was that I was infact still a incompetent, useless mama's boy, and I knew that, but I really did not wanted to be a nuisance to her, so I told that I may not be that useful in house chores, and she said ""Do whatever you can""

tbh, I was really happy about it.

Hence, the next 3 months, I spend learning the basics of house work, and increasing my workload of housework to relief her somewhat, I learned cooking (I really burned my hand once seriously, tho she never noticed, Idk how) while handling dates, university, etc too.

I always knew what I was doing was bare minimum, I really did not expect anything special like wordful appreciation, but maybe a pat of my back? I just wanted someone to say good job, and pat on my back for the work once or twice. I never got it.

But I know I am not entitled for appreciation for doing the bare minimum, even tho no one really taught me it.

So, to self affirm myself, or pat myself on my own back, I smugly said, ""heh, I must be such a charming boyfriend, I do help my love in various housework, I cook for almost everyday for her, and I manage to be one of the tops in my uni too""

She said, ""What are you happy about, it just a bare minimum, I cooked for you starting 1 month straight continuously too, now it's just evening out""

I agreed with her, but I just felt tiny ache in my heart, I wanted to cry maybe, eyes got watery, then she said, ""are you crying? what are you? a child?"", and laughed it off.

But the bare minimum really started ringing in my ears, for her gifts were bare minimum, to plan the dates for both of us were bare minimum, to open door, to hold chairs for her were minimum, being emotionally their at all times was bare minimum.

I know I am doing bare minimum, and I will not pretend otherwise, she is also not wrong.

But it really seemed to me, no matter what I do, I never will go above ""bare minimum""

It was like I was stuck in a loop with a no way out. It's just today, I felt I should give up everything, hence I called her ""Sorry, I think we should break, we are just not compatible, you deserve a lot more than my bare minimum, I am sorry, I will take my stuff out, and move back to my dorm tomorrow.""

That ""bare minimum"" really spiraled in my head, but I have really one big regret, that I should have learnt all of this for my mom, not for anyone else, maybe she would have smiled while was cooking for her?

I keep thinking about this fantasy I have. I‚Äôm going to move to Hoboken NJ but my dream is to live in the city. Or something like that. I‚Äôm with my lover, someone who wants better for me than I do. I speak in sexual favors because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs comfortable. That‚Äôs mine, and mine alone. We get iced coffee from Starbucks at night and watch movies and fuck. We sleep in late. 

The next morning, we go again and then we take the subway out to go shopping. It‚Äôs the weekend so there‚Äôs no rush, and we cook dinner while listening to Taylor Swift‚Äôs Speak Now TV on vinyl. I feel like growing up. I feel like something inside of me grew, somehow, even though someone poisoned the dirt. 

I have had an obsession with the purple from Speak Now ever since I realized that maybe my family was not normal. But one day I just dream of being able to dance to those songs, sing them, and not feel like a ruse.

____

It‚Äôs always been bad but it‚Äôs never been this bad. Or maybe I just got used to it being good that I forgot how bad it was.

sex and sexual appeal is the only thing that‚Äôs mine. i just really pray that someone will appreciate me for who I am. who will tolerate my emotional avoidance and sort of hypersexuality. who will stop trying to convince me that 2+2 equals 5!!!! 

At first it was just munchausens by proxy but now I might actually be going insane. My dad was screaming all night and then the next day he told me I was imagining it and that I was the one screaming. I‚Äôve cried so much that they‚Äôre convinced I‚Äôm bipolar now. I may be at this point.

and I was so scared that me agreeing to be sent away would be like me losing.

1m61zyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonduality/comments/1m61zyz/_/,?,"You begin in the throes of division, a self grasping at ideas, quietly whispering ""What is real?"". Perhaps it was sheer trauma that started to shake the narrative, perhaps it was that never ending void inside you.. 

You decide to sit down, you wrestle, carve experience into awareness and its echoes. One moment, the gears slow: time splinters (past and future unmasked as tales or predictions, only existing conceptually. The present seams infinitely divisible, governed by relativity), Space itself melts (no ""here"" to be defined without ""there"", ""where"" needs to be in relation to ""something""), and every framework‚Äîscience, spirit, even ""enlightenment""‚Äîstands revealed as mere arrows toward the unseen. The mind cries ""I need to know!"" But even that, it too, falls apart. So what remains? Just ""this"". Not a place, not a solution. Only the rain‚Äôs touch, the city‚Äôs drone, the bare pulse of infinite possibilities before names, projections, or a clinging thought. The seeking fades. The cosmos breathes out into the same silence it breathed in.

Turning the gaze within again. That ""I"" who aches? Gone as a flash of lightning striking through a web of nerves. The ego? Still goes on, a handy mirage‚Äîa role that's no longer lost in its own script, nor mistaking itself for a playwright. The threads unwind: instincts of flesh, imprints of culture, ripples of cause and effect, all entwined. ""But I feel solid!"" you argue. So you peer deeper: every pulse, thought, or memory emerges unclaimed. Just like clouds roaming a boundless sky, itself dependent on every droplet dreaming it owns them. When this strikes, laughter breaks free: You were never caged. The bars were woven from your own exhale.

Reality is no longer fixed in your narratives. Your morning coffee cup is cosmic dust, so is the coffee and the fingers that cradle it; A thoughts now sparking in a mind no longer sculpted by the ages. It whispers, ""this is ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ (Emptiness) huh, not absence, but a flowing reliance"". But in this stillness, even tales of ""≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ"" slip away when clutched. Here, opposites tangle: being and nothingness consume and birth each other; form is emptiness, emptiness is form. The world turns trickster and every ""thing"" well, it's up to you really, just don't get high on your own supply... If you don't, you brush a table and it may sing of creation‚Äôs dawn. You hurt, and the whole universe nudges itself alert.

The brain, once a chain to materialism, now dances with its creations, neurons firing as thought given form and form given thought. Understanding what science still fails to realize, Body and mind aren‚Äôt split... They‚Äôre one seamless hum. So it goes with the machines we now rely on: Their electric patterns are the flow of our projected meaning. What used to be inner world and outer world, melt away in an eternal embrace under your piercing gaze. 

Take now, this instant ‚Äî Where‚Äôs the boundary? You might say, ""It‚Äôs just some handsome poetic schizo Redditor, typing to other less handsome Redditors,"" but this code displayed on your screen was once stardust, these redditors once the heavens. And in this fleeting sliver, vast and tiny, the all shifted endlessly to converge and wink at itself from the vantage point of both of ""us"" due to some cosmic/probabilistic alignment. 

You let go of every label, even letting go itself, and you‚Äôre ""undefined"". You are a question mark, unraveling tales while marveling at their folly, seeing past even the seeing. Duality folds and Non-duality eats itself. It was always so, but there's no longer clutching, stitching every insight into the saga as the whole tapestry dissolves, even the dissolving. 

Every glance, seemingly collapses endless possibilities into form, like a living Heisenberg riddle. Not as masters, but as threads in the ""measure"" of all things. Feeling like a strikingly familiar distant echo, you see that every breath rises from this ""interconnectedness"" sinking back to ""interconnectedness,"" yet it‚Äôs just a murmur of tangled roots, also ""interconnectedness"" shaped by the myth of ""me"" and what I hold.

The veils have been pierced, and every layer bares its reliance, its hollowness. Suffering ends in a quiet echoes of a story that the moment needs to unfold. The universe bends to what‚Äôs gripped, shaping void through webs of mind that are the shaping, growing beyond dual, non-dual, both, and neither...

Like a bell rung by a falling board, its chime blooming out of ""inter-connectedness"", rippling as it's voice, each vibration fading back to the emptiness as an echo of memory ‚Äî You suddenly glimpse the untouched ""?"". Just this, free of blindness casting words, worlds, selves, or shadows.

Freedom rests before words (which, as we‚Äôve seen, aren‚Äôt ""things"" and themselves part of the expression). It pierces all stories as part of its question mark, leaving infinite ""maybes"" unboxed. Not by silencing thought (also another tale), but by spotting the void in all things at once, like clutching water till you see it‚Äôs water clutching water, the wave chasing the sea and in doing so, creating a whirlpool of suffering. So, the wave rides its ""wave-ness"" till its spark shifts, a ripple in the calm never disturbing it. All seas are water too.

Every story, is a story of seeking, Perhaps, this is why the Buddha wove ""Nirvana"" as a pointer into existence‚Äôs fabric ‚Äî not a prize for the ""I"" to seize, but the truth untouched. Perhaps this is why Heisenberg was uncertain and Einstein was relative. Perhaps, this is why light, in quantum play, pointed at by Feynman‚Äôs sums, tests every path yet picks the swiftest from ""A"" to ""B"". When light travels reality‚Äôs edge in C, it nears the raw pulse we're pointing towards. To a photon, ""A"" to ""B"" is timeless. 

This is not meant as a rigorous scientific post, just a pointer to the emergent stories trying to describe the same reality using more labels. Don't get lost in the sauce, just know its taste enough to see what's being pointed to.

With each breath, as the universe ""expands"" into itself, even beyond light‚Äôs reach ‚Äî We are also that expansion ‚Äî We touch the pulse of the transcendental, a knowing woven into every being. The emptiness pulsing as a body-mind can be glimpsed through Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs equations too, where the senses (mind included) and the reality they measure together (weaving the tapestry of conscious experience), are also the same ""?"" being measured. The catch is, each measurement itself, changes the measuring and perpetuates the next measurement. When ever-shifting measurements are falsely integrated into the measuring device, the illusions of self naturally arise to give coherence of the data, also part of this delicate dance.  

However, This makes it possible to rest in a state beyond the measurement itself, yet experience nothing separate within the act of measuring. The uncertainty principle also points to some properties being fundamentally unknowable until measured, their nature unbound until the moment of contact. 

When we see the voidness of all things inter-dependent, the heavens fade, the hells fade, all fades. Only this ""?"" remains, at experience‚Äôs core. With every pointer to ""it"", including ""?"", inadvertently measuring it into ignorance when clung to.

If you're left to ponder: this ""me"" is just causes and conditions in chorus, clinging to frail illusions that mirror what‚Äôs held ‚Äî a vast net of delusion and pain, trapped in tales too small for the question mark. This pondering too, is also ""it"".

All form is still water, misread and fixed from boundless chance by a kind of cosmic tally. Quantum realms show this, but so does life ‚Äî Where‚Äôs the line between me and my pieces? Cells? Atoms? Fluctuations? Their flicker? Emptiness is form and form is emptiness.

Awake awareness seems to skip this fixing, seeing past every ""could be"" ‚Äî not by living them or claiming them as ""own"", but by resting in the untouched real. It undoes every trick the brain‚Äôs measure spins. No measure, no name, no fixing‚Äîjust ""?"". The lights are on, but nobody's home.

As a parting Koan: What‚Äôs the sound of ""?"". Hear it, and it‚Äôs gone. Miss it, and it's deafening.",2,1753150279.0,nonduality,1,0.75,False

Thankfully this week was a more settled round in terms of injuries, unless there are any suprises in this evening's injury report (or if you have the soon-to-be-retired Docherty).  Onwards to options for luxury trades or injury cover.


**DEFENDERS**


**Sinclair - 486K**, if you don't have him he should be on the radar as someone to slot into flex or defence (say, if Rozee remains out or plays poorly with his broken hand). It's hard to beat a run that has MEL/NTH/RIC/ESS as the next four, and Sinclair looked to have the run of the backline with NWM playing more midfield time.


**Clark - 540K**, great value, great role, and highly consistent (excepting two games scoring ~50), and plays WCE, CAR, PTA next which should all be favourable matchups for his role.


**Wanganeen-Milera - 615K**, if you could have your pick of any player in defence this week it would be NWM. Has the run home against MEL/NTH/RIC/ESS, and he has been near impossible to stop irrespective of his position in defence or attending CBAs. 


*Speculative Defence Picks*


**T Young - 235K**, I would usually advise against picking unproven defenders in poor performing teams at any stage of the season, but if you are exceptionally light on cash or need to do a downgrade to facilitate a rogue upgrade elsewhere (eg TDK to Grundy) then this could be a reasonable pick. His high scoring output is largely due to high disposal efficiency (94% and 100%) with only a moderate amount of disposals, although this was against WCE and ESS who aren't exactly exemplaries of forawrd-50 pressure, so he may find it difficult to maintain in upcoming matches against COL/GCS/GEE.


**MIDFIELDERS**


Most people have one or both of the Freo midfielders by now, but this week is a great week to pick up the other one if you can. **Brayshaw - 545K** is the more expensive of the two but is still one of the best value inclusions in terms of price per point scored thus far, and it's hard to see WCE/CAR/PTA having an answer for him. **Serong - 509K** has done well this year in games where he hasn't been tagged, and it's hard to see teams in the three upcoming matches having an answer for him. Cincotta has done well tagging Merrett and Butters this year but was omitted from Carlton's side last week, so there is always the risk he's brough back next week to tag Serong. The main value play this week is to pick whichever of the two you don't have, or probably to pick Serong if you have neither.


**Richards - 535K**, after a poor score last round secondary to poor disposal efficiency, Richards has fallen to the absurd price of 535K. With games against ESS, MEL, WCE upcoming he should finish out the year strong. His supercoach counterpart is Liberatore, and we can expect them both to score similarly however Richards could be tagged against GWS and Liberatore costs 43K more, so it's a matter of picking whichever is most appropriate for your cash / risk tolerance.


**Heeney - 588K**, had a blistering game last week and has been in excellent form for the latter half of the year, and it's easy to see him scoring 140+ against ESS and WCE to finish up the year. The trouble is that he will likely be tagged against GWS and GEE this week, and has demonstrated a susceptibility to being tagged this year. He's a good inclusion if you have the cash and want to ride the possible captain scores but can weather the tag games.


*Speculative Midfield Picks*


**Davies-Uniacke - 458K**, if you need a cheap insert for the midfield, you could consider LDU. He has a 103 5-round average if you exclude his injury game against WBD, and his recent scores against his upcoming opponents have been decently competetive (90+). He's not someone that I would be overjoyed about bringing in, but if you're forced into a low price trade then this could suffice.


**RUCKS**


Given that the situation is largely unchanged from last week, my advice would be to select the highest on this list that you can afford: **Grundy - 733K** > **Gawn - 563K** > **English - 554K** = **Cameron - 564K** (English has the slightly better ruck matchup run home) > **Jackson - 567K** > **Meek - 564K** = **Witts - 542K**.


You may noted that Marshall has been omitted. Heath has been in the team sharing ruck duties with Marshall which has had a noticable impact on Marshall's scores, with his ruck contests dropping from 85% to 60%. If Heath is named this week then I would avoid the selection.


**FORWARDS**


**Kennedy - 452K**, it's difficult to explain the score of 23 against ADE other than to say it was an anomoly as his CBA% only dropped marginally but he just couldn't find the ball. With that game as the only major exception, Kennedy has been a reliable scorer since round 6 and he has 3 easy matchups coming up. He's probably the best value inclusion in the forward line this week.


**Macrae - 520K**, has been a reliable scorer over the previous 5 weeks against decent opposition with  a 107 5-round average. We should hopefully see this sscoringand form continue against weaker teams in MEL/NTH/RIC/ESS.


**Jackson - 567K**, while playing alongside Darcy he hasn't reached the same scoring heights as when he was the solo ruck, his floor has been decent (~80) amongst a generally poor-scoring mix of alternatives in the forward line. He'd be a decent inclusion this week against WCE, and assuming that Darcy is rested during one of the away games (PTA round 22 or WBD round 24) ahead of finals, we may also get to see another 140+ ceiling score if Jackson solo rucks.


*Speculative Forward Picks*


**Cameron - 445K**, I am now strongly regretting picking Humphrey over Cameron last week despite the reasoning being sound. Cameron demonstrated he has the capacity to score big over the final weeks, and it's difficult to see NTH/PTA/ESS/RIC having any way to stop him. He's a great pick if you're looking for someone who may not be the most reliable but has the capacity to score 120+.


**Miers - 538K**, a decent but more expensive speculative forward option with his strong run of form and good set of matchups over the final few weeks.

Helped a friend and now I feel taken for granted,"I used to be in a role that was extremely fast paced and very mentally draining. I managed to secure a much better role within the same organisation approximately 6 months ago and have been much happier since. In my old team, there were a few people that I spoke to quite regularly and considered as potential friends.

One of them (A) lacked confidence and was extremely insecure about their abilities and strengths and interview skills. I know what it feels like to be in that role and I know how much it impacts you both emotionally and physically. Think getting yelled at every day sort of thing. Since I got out and I knew what worked for me, when they asked me for help, I willingly helped them review their resume. I fixed their grammar and streamlined it to fit the job ad. I told them who to reach out to and how, and basically spoon fed what to say and how to approach making contact. I helped them prep for the interview and after a few weeks, they got the call that the role was theirs. The interview answers they provided and the examples were among the best the interviewer had heard and basically was exactly what they wanted in this role.

Our old manager was very overbearing and was always in everyone's business. He initially discouraged this person from applying elsewhere since he was sure they wouldn't make it anywhere else. Long story short, another team member was inspired by A succesfully leaving and decided to take the plunge and apply to a role too. This person (B) got the role too and shared in a group chat how they were so grateful for their manager because he had called them and basically dictated word for word what should be written and how they should approach the process.

The thing is, the verbiage is eerily similar to what I used and what I advised A to use. There's just a bit of a bitter taste right now for me, as I only intended to share this information with A. A keeps reiterating how grateful they are to me but keeps asking for more help with their new role which I'm not doing as I'm busy with my own role. I also don't like the fact that A doesn't seem to have a backbone and has shared everything with the manager who consistently disparaged them and actively discouraged them. I wouldn't really care if it was theirs to share but I feel very taken advantage of. I don't know if I'm overreacting in this instance.

A friend of mine also mentioned how it was funny that A hadn't even bothered to buy me a coffee or a small meal as a token of thanks considering A has said they hate owing people things and that they wouldn't have gotten the role without me.

- 2 lemons (2 slices per water)
- 5 banana 
- 1lb bag baby carrots
- 32oz rice (you will have extra left over) 
- 1 can tuna (add more if you need more filling)

Avocado Toast 
- Avocado (add on per meal, depending on how many you want)
- mandarins (usually come in a $5 bag)
- Italian loaf 
- pre-made coffee or diy ingredients 

Recommended to add in some more protein with the avocado meal as it's more for a quick snack

1m61p1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1m61p1y/dont_feel_like_myself/,Don't feel like myself.,"Hi there,

For the better part of 3 years, I (30F) haven't felt normal. Long post, sorry in advance for my frustration, for potentially seeming like a hypochondriac, and for listing everything wrong with me right now. I have no idea what's relevant. Also sorry for TMI details. 

BACKGROUND: 
I have a complicated medical history and had Lyme disease in 2019/2020, and 6 knee surgeries between 2018 and 2023. Of the knee surgeries, two were minor arthroscopies, two were failed ACLs with microfracturing, and two were an osteotomy (with 3 bone plugs and a titanium plate), followed by the removal of said plate. After that last surgery, I busted my (3 letter word for behind) getting back into fitness and returning to running. I dont have an ACL in my left knee and there's a lot of damage in there meniscus, cartilage), but it's functional and manageable. I take tylenol/motrin as needed after intense run days (500-1000mg tylenol max a day, 400-800mg mortin max a day, IF REQUIRED). Background over.

RIDICULOUS LIST OF SYMPTOMS:
My health has deteriorated a lot since the last surgery: 
-My skin is always dry and my feet have started cracking despite significant efforts otherwise. 
-My hair is THIN... it is always falling out when I brush it, even with detangling product, i dont dye it anymore, but used to (stopped 12 months ago~). 
-I'm so, so tired, even after sleeping. 
-My bones (especially my hands and ankles) hurt terribly for no reason. 
-I've been feeling faint.
-I get breathless when I have to talk to people (sitting or standing). 
-I always feel like there's mucuous in my throat or my nose is stuffy. 
-I've had dark circles that won't disappear for like, 3 years. 
-I've gained 30lbs since 2023... working overtime to keep it at 160~. 
-I pee way too frequently... idk if this is important, but my pee is sometimes green after vitamins and it smells like oat milk when I drink coffee. No idea if that happens normally. Lol. Sorry.
-I dont get periods, save for like 2-3 days here and there (depo shots--i know they cause weight gain, but I've only been on it for a year). 
-another TMI, but like, every time I have sex IT tears (i havent given birth to kids, adequately wet, just weak skin meets normal size john?). 

There's a lot that feels WRONG. and it sounds like I'm  being a hypochondriac--I know. But I know my body doesn't feel normal. I know that I have unanswered symptoms. I know I have physical pain that shouldn't be there. 

THE PROBLEM: 
The lymph nodes in the side of my neck and under my jaw have become visible when chewing or just ""findable"" to someone who had never before seen them or felt them (so im admittedly feeling paranoid). For years ive been finding new lymphnodes this way. Now, the lymphnodes, like, in front of my ear but slightly below, have been rock solid for about a year and I was experiencing intermittent ""stabbing"" there (think by the parotid gland or maybe its the actual gland?). They did an ultra sound and ran some blood tests last year, and all was normal, even though the technician scarcely went over the ""node"" or lump in question. They told me to watch it. For 6 months I did. It hasn't grown, but it doesn't feel great, and last Thursday it was aggressively spasming/stabbing me in pulses, to the extent I was screaming/yelping/shrieking (not steady screaming but the oh heck that Hella hurt kinda way) and grasping at it while on the phone with family... its the left side with the other lymphnodes, but the right side spasmed slightly too. Everyone in the fam is worried. 

MY CONCERNS:
Thankfully, I wasn't at work. I wasn't driving. I wasn't doing anything that could have resulted in harm. But I dont want to wait until it does. 

SECONDARY CONCERNS: 
A couple of weeks ago, at a lady appointment for birth control, I asked about checking my hormones because... symptoms galore--someone else suggested it. Well, the doc refused to test hormones and instead ran other blood panels... my blood pressure was elevated (pretty high for me) and my liver enzymes (AST, ALT, Albumin(sp?)) were rather high (47 AST, 76 ALT, 8.2 albumin) and 2 other tests were mildly high and low (monocyte % auto 3.1% (low) and neutrophil % auto 77.4% (high)). Everything else looks normal.

MITIGATING EFFORTS/ABOUT ME:
-I dont smoke (never have)
-I rarely drink (1-3 drinks a year). 
-I workout (95% cardio) 4-5 days a week, sometimes 2x a day. 
-I take vitamins (multi and a handful of others for bone care, digestive health, lady health, hair skin and nails, etc). 
-I drink so much water (14-18 cups a day). 
-I eat moderately healthy and I'll admit I drink coffee 3-4 days a week (latte of 300-400 cals maybe), or sometimes have a treat, but otherwise, I'm consistently keeping my calorie intake below 1600 (I know i could go lower, but when I get hungry at end of the day I get stupid tired and listless)... 
I stretch every night. 
-I sleep regular hours (8-9pm to 4am)-anything longer feels worse. 
-Im not in an environment of stress (though previously, for like 4 years i was over taxed, burned out, just hated my jobs-in a good role now). 
-I treat my hair and skin gently with care products (leave in conditioner on ends, hair and skin masks, body lotion, vitamin c moisturizer, pore toner, sun screen--i dont do make up except mascara). 
-Also, double triple checked i'm not pregnant.


On paper, I should be fine. But I feel like life is sucking the soul out of me. My doctors arent concerned, but for frame of reference... it's military medicine and I have ALWAYS struggled to get adequate care. It took years for them to find an ACL tear despite having done an MRI and Arthroscopy. It took them a year to run blood tests despite my pleading that I felt literally dead. It took 9 months to identify the ACL had re-torn despite the knee being the size of a softball and me complaining of constant instability. I'm tired of waiting for care and I've lost faith thay their doing their diligence... i mean, the next appt out is 3 wks. I'm willing to pay out of pocket for the right tests/imaging. I know there are cheaper options. But idk what I'm looking for and really hope someone can help me come up with a testing/imaging plan to investigate whatever the important symptoms are.

1m61nag,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetLagTheGame/comments/1m61nag/small_hide_and_seek_on_foot_on_college_campus/,Small Hide and Seek on Foot on College Campus,"Hello! I had mentioned at one point that some friends and I were playing a game of hide and seek on foot on Purdue University's campus. Here's what we did and how it went!

  
PreGame

* We did the game all on foot since Purdue has kneecapped their on campuses buses and city buses not running as much on summer weekends.
* We played with 4 people, 2 teams of 2. We were all viewers of the show and alums of the university.
* For stations, we used a Google My Maps to just picked stations before hand - trying to have decent spread/density and stations being something decently recognizable.
* All our prework and link to map can be found here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3txyWY-VfkBttNF2FRJ\_8KNMWw9rtaU0zlFkHIvJCE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v3txyWY-VfkBttNF2FRJ_8KNMWw9rtaU0zlFkHIvJCE/edit?usp=sharing)
* We removed any curses we thought wouldn't work (like egg and lemon due to lack of stores, and any referencing transit). We did add 2 custom curses.
* We defined our administrative districts and determined some custom measuring/matching questions.
* I printed versions of the map on 11x17 paper so we could see it well for seekers. Had to cross reference with google maps with our pins.
* We did decrease our hiding zone radius to 750 ft.

Actual Game

* We managed to have both teams get a run as hider. We started a little after 10 am at the Purdue Memorial Union.
* Run 1 (I was a seeker)
   * We asked same area of campus for a no.
   * Walked into residential campus for a radar, hit.
   * Did a measuring to Stadium Road (afterwards, we discussed that we probably did the major road measuring wrong, but that we liked how we did it)
   * We got hit by Mediocre Travel Agent and sent to a coffee shop (that they didn't realize was closed). But there was a little free library nearby for our souvenir! 
   * After clearing, immediately hit by water weight. We went across the street and spent $20 at vending machines to clear it. 
   * Asked for photo of building from station.
   * Then tallest structure in sightline
   * Got hit by unguided tourist, hiders did helpful note when we had gotten too far from it, there was some construction hampering.
   * Asked nearest major street, then did 1/2 mile thermometer.
   * After thermometer, we were sure we were where they were, so they hit us with gamblers feet.
   * Our GPS was apparently being weird so they did not realize we were almost to them at that point.
   * They ended with 2:15 which includes their time bonuses, hiding at Hilltop.
* Rune 2 (I was hider)
   * We decided to go ahead and do our hiding run, even though there were some storms rolling in. Seekers were fine with this. They went and had lunch, we should have joined and waited to hide in hindsight.
   * We decided to hide with Pfendler as our station. That building was closed, so we hung out in nearby St. Toms (which was within our hiding zone just in case)
   * We did forget to pass off seeker pad, so I sent photos of the pages.
   * Storms started. We offered to let them pause, but they decided not to (they did end up running somewhere to buy ponchos/umbrellas)
   * They asked closer/further from McCormick Rd (which they agreed later was kinda overpowered)
   * We sent curse of the unguided tourist (one of only 2 curses we drew)
   * They apparently asked a store employee for help which was super useful.
   * They did same area of campus question which was miss.
   * Then 1/2 mile radar.
   * Then tallest structure. At this point, they were moving our way so we went to our hiding spot off a small hiddenish path.
   * Then they asked selfie. 
   * Then widest street, which they were just out of our hiding zone so we ran to answer. 
   * We were found with 1:337 including time bonuses.
   * Our card draws were quite unlucky.

After the Game/What we learned

* We loved it! It was a lot of fun (other than the rain)
* Our stations worked well, but we need a better way to measure distance, since google maps goes from 0.1 to 0.2 - so guessing 750 was hard.
* I need to pack more snacks - I honestly just forgot so had limited ones.
* We are considering a few more custom questions and curses.
* We need to add some smaller thermometers - only the 1/2 mile was useful.
* We plan to play again!

Feel free to ask any questions! Hopefully this helps anyone else wanting to do a small game on foot. We also are considering an even smaller game in our hometown and very small campus we work on.",6,1753149300.0,JetLagTheGame,4,0.88,False

I‚Äôm writing because the last few days have been some of the most taxing I‚Äôve ever experienced, and I need advice‚Ä¶ or maybe not advice exactly. I just need help making sure I‚Äôm not losing my mind.

It all started a few days ago. I won‚Äôt lie ‚Äî I was a bit under the influence, scrolling through some Reddit 50/50s. You know, the page that gives you two possible outcomes: one wholesome like puppies, the other usually something gross or NSFW. The twist is, you don‚Äôt get to choose ‚Äî it‚Äôs random what you‚Äôll see when you click.

It had been a long, stressful week at work, so I planned to unwind. I was drinking ‚Äî about a beer per page ‚Äî so by the time I hit page 13, I was definitely feeling it. That‚Äôs when I came across a strange link:

‚ÄúPuppy Bowl Greatest Plays‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Truth Behind the Uncanny Valley.‚Äù

I chuckled and said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.‚Äù Needless to say, it wasn‚Äôt the Puppy Bowl.

It linked to a plain webpage with just a video player ‚Äî no title, no description. Still in the spirit of the game, I clicked play. A cold, mechanical voice began narrating the four-minute video:

‚ÄúThe Uncanny Valley is a theory introduced in 1970 by Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics expert. It describes the relationship between how human-like something appears, and how we emotionally respond to it.‚Äù

A graph appeared on the screen as the voice continued.

‚ÄúThe most unsettling point is at the bottom of the valley ‚Äî when something looks almost human, but something is‚Ä¶ off.‚Äù

A few AI-generated images and robotic faces flashed across the screen. They weren‚Äôt grotesque, but something about them made me deeply uneasy.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal to feel discomfort or fear when you see images like these. But where does that fear come from?‚Äù

Suddenly, the page glitched and started to freak out ‚Äî flashing distorted images of AI art. The voice came back, but it no longer sounded robotic. It sounded‚Ä¶ human, but wrong. Just slightly off.

‚ÄúThe fear is primal. It comes from a deep, ancient part of your species‚Äô memory. An evolutionary response to something that looked human‚Ä¶ but wasn‚Äôt. Something dangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù I muttered, frantically clicking the close button ‚Äî but the video wouldn‚Äôt stop.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always been here,‚Äù the voice said. ‚ÄúA random face in the crowd. And you never notice. But when you do‚Ä¶ you look away. You keep walking.‚Äù

Panic rising, I held down the power button on my desktop. The voice cut off mid-sentence, but not before the screen flashed one final image: a video feed from my own webcam.

It showed me ‚Äî but the face on the screen was smiling. The smile was wide, too wide, with porcelain-white teeth that were eerily straight.

Shaking, I poured a glass of whiskey to steady my nerves and went to bed‚Ä¶ but I was up and down all night. 

Part 2 
        
I wish I could tell you that the night ended there‚Äîa scary video and a panic attack, washed away by a pint of Jack. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said that was all.

The next morning, I woke up nursing a brutal hangover on top of barely any sleep. My eyes burned, the bitter, sour taste of bile clung to the back of my throat, and my head pounded like a war drum. I knew I needed to eat, but I had zero motivation to cook. Eventually, I mustered the strength to get dressed and stumble down to the local deli.

I ordered my usual: sausage, egg, and cheese with a hashbrown tucked in, plus a black coffee. The cashier stared at me‚Äîprobably because I looked like hell‚Äîbut said nothing, just rang me up. A few minutes later, she called my name. I stepped up to grab my sandwich, and she was staring again.

Uncomfortable, I tried to break the tension. ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm kind of a mess. Had a long night.‚Äù

She blinked and suddenly seemed to snap out of it. ‚ÄúOh! I‚Äôm sorry, sir. I don‚Äôt know why, but I could‚Äôve sworn I served you earlier this morning. Weird. Anyway, have a great day!‚Äù

She brushed it off and returned to the register like nothing had happened.

If I weren‚Äôt so hungover, I might‚Äôve asked her what she meant. But I felt like death, and I knew if I didn‚Äôt get food in me fast, I‚Äôd redecorate the deli floor. So I made a beeline for my apartment. And that‚Äôs when things started to get weird again.

My computer monitor was off‚Äîbut the webcam light was on.

How long had it been like that? Had it ever turned off? Was it recording?

I reached to unplug it, bumping the desk in the process. The screen flickered on. My stomach dropped.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on!?‚Äù I yelled.

The video was still playing.

That same face‚Äîway too close to the camera‚Äîfilled the screen. It began speaking again, completely unfazed:

‚ÄúYour brain has two options. The first is to try to make sense of it. This often presents as d√©j√† vu, or a vague feeling that you‚Äôve seen something before, even though you haven‚Äôt.‚Äù

It paused.

The silence dragged on‚Äîlong enough to make my skin crawl.

Then it continued.

‚ÄúThe second option is fear. Most will call it paranoia, or maybe agita. A vague discomfort at seeing a stranger you think you recognize. They‚Äôre the smart ones.‚Äù

It smiled then.

That awful, hideously perfect porcelain smile‚Äîimpossibly white teeth, too many of them.

‚ÄúMy question for you is this: next time you see one of us, how will you respond? Will you fear us‚Ä¶ or brush us off, like that cute girl at the deli? Oh well, we won‚Äôt have to wait much longer to find out‚Ä¶‚Äù

It chuckled, and the screen cut to black. Then it rebooted to a blue screen.

All I could hear was the pounding of my heart, thudding like it was trying to escape my chest. ",1,1753149210.0,u_Unlikely-Exercise583,0,1.0,False

Just a few months ago, I missed my monthly period and was unsure why it didn‚Äôt show. I was on some new meds which wasn‚Äôt a good mix, so I ordered a pregnancy test online that‚Äôd be here in a jiff. 

Before I say more I just want you to know, having another baby for me is a big nono. 
I don‚Äôt want more children and that‚Äôs a fact. 
It‚Äôs medically and mentally a solid fact.

So the next day came, and I took the test. 
To my surprise there were two bright lines. 
I figured it was a mistake and took another to see the same two lines. 
I freaked the heck out and curled up in a ball, thinking there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm pregnant, and started to ball. 

I made my husband go to the store, and he came back with digitals galore. 
I took two of them, and both showed negative. I breathed a sigh of relief, but then I was lost. WTF

Why do my first two tests say that I‚Äôm pregnant, but my last two tests say I‚Äôm not? 
So I go back to Amazon and look at what I got.

TL;DR:
Ordered prank pregnancy tests by accident and thought I was pregnant. It was a false alarm‚Äîjust me punking myself. I PRANKED MYSELF. 

That was an hour of my life I can‚Äôt get back. Who pranks their own self on a test they bought!? I told my husband he needs to get a vasectomy.

Ive been on this sub for some time now and have talked a lot about my ibs-m and my constipation to diarrhea cycle that ive been stuck in for a while now. Well a 2 weeks ago I got a colonoscopy and felt the cleanest Ive ever been. Afterward, I made sure to take my fiber supplements and eat fiber and drink water to get myself into better habits and get my gut into a more moral cycle. The week right after the colonoscopy I was on vacation and I was still feeling constipated, so I drank a coffee every day (which I don't normally do bc it sometimes triggers bad d\* at work and I am a teacher) to keep things moving. This past week was my first week back to work and I was SO constipated. I felt even more constipated than I have ever been. Im not sure if it was the added 10g of fiber a day blocking me up and now lack of coffee, but I dint go for 1 week and was SO uncomfortable.

Thursday, I told myself that if i dint go by Friday that I would take a strong stimulant or even do an enema if I needed to. on break I decided to go to Kung  Fu Tea (a bubble tea place) and get the Aloe Jelly as an add in to see how that would go since I knew aloe is a great natural laxative. I drank it around 3pm and felt fine and nothing happened by the time i went to bed around 11pm...

Friday at 1am all hell breaks loose. Im so bloated I feel like a balloon was trying to force its way out of me but had nowhere to go but down. I finally was able to pass stool, too much, too fast, and too liquidy, but wasn't able to stop until 3am once my insides stopped spasming. I was finally able to crawl to my bed to grab a pillow an blanket to sleep on the floor outside the bathroom just in case.

I wake up Friday morning for work and tell myself that the worst is over. I go to the bathroom and, somehow, it starts all over again from 6am-8am. I obviously call out and spend the rest of the day sipping water and alternating between the bed and the floor. My stomach was so sore as if i did a total HIIT workout the day before and I was barely able to stand straight or walk. Nighttime rolls around and it happens again from 8pm-9pm. Afterward, I made my way to bed and prayed to any god to release me from this hell and went to sleep.

Saturday I wake up still extremely sore but didn't pass anything all day, so better than Friday, but still couldn't stand straight or walk. I did eat a piece of toast for lunch and soup for dinner. Sunday, stomach still sensitive but didnt pass anything. I was also very weak and shaky from what I believe was hunger and low electrolytes. I was able to eat granola for lunch, a little oat muffin for a snack, and oatmeal for dinner.

Its now Monday when I write this and im finally eating normally but am still very aware of my stomach. I will never touch aloe jelly again unless I have 4 days to spare with enough desperation. The colonoscopy cleanse was much kinder.",1,1753148970.0,ibs,0,0.67,False

Creating a cozy atmosphere isn't just about throwing random items on your table - it's about thoughtful arrangement and selecting pieces that speak to you.

First, I started with the right coffee table. After searching through countless options, I found some amazing choices here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. The key is picking one that matches your room's style while being functional.

Let me break down what actually works for creating that warm, inviting feel:

Layer different heights - I use a mix of tall candlesticks, medium-sized vases, and lower items like books. This creates visual interest without looking cluttered.

Books are your best friend. I stack 2-3 large, attractive books (think photography or art books) and use them as platforms for smaller decor items.

Natural elements make a huge difference. I added a small potted plant and some wooden beads in a bowl. These organic touches instantly make the space feel more welcoming.

Consider the rule of three - I group items in threes, which somehow just works better than even numbers. For example, a candle, a small plant, and a decorative box.

Don't forget practical items. I keep a stylish coaster set and a small tray for remotes. They're functional but still add to the overall aesthetic.

Seasonal touches keep things fresh. I switch out certain items every few months - pine cones in winter, fresh flowers in spring, seashells in summer.

If you're looking to upgrade your coffee table first, check out some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables. Having the right base makes decorating so much easier.

Remember to leave some empty space. This was hard for me at first - I wanted to fill every inch! But negative space is crucial for a balanced, peaceful look.

One mistake I made early on was using too many small items. They just created visual noise. Fewer, larger pieces actually make more impact and feel more intentional.

The final touch that really brings everything together is lighting. I placed a medium-sized candle on my coffee table, and when lit in the evening, it creates the perfect cozy ambiance.

Try moving things around until it feels right to you. There's no strict formula - what matters is that the arrangement makes you feel comfortable and at home.

I sometimes snap a quick photo of my arrangement. It helps me see it with fresh eyes and make adjustments. Plus, I can refer back to arrangements that worked well in the past.",1,1753148366.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1m61ahb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m61ahb,The Budget vs. Actual Showdown: 5 Financial Insights Your Accountant Isn't Telling You.,"# Budget vs. Actual Showdown: What Your Variance Reports Are Really Telling You

Let‚Äôs be honest. For most small business owners, the word ‚Äúbudget‚Äù lands with all the excitement of a root canal. You spend hours, maybe even days, painstakingly crafting a financial plan for the year. You project revenues, estimate expenses, and map out your path to profitability. Then, you file it away, and the chaos of running your business takes over.

Every now and then, you might glance at a report from your accounting software that says ""Budget vs. Actuals."" You see a sea of numbers, some red, some black, and your eyes glaze over. It feels like a report card judging your past performance‚Äîa chore, not a tool.

But what if I told you that this boring, often-ignored report is actually a treasure map? What if, hidden within those numbers, are the exact clues you need to find hidden profits, slash wasteful spending, and navigate your business around looming dangers?

That‚Äôs the reality. The **budget vs. actual** showdown isn‚Äôt about judgment; it‚Äôs about discovery. It‚Äôs the single most powerful tool for transforming your business from running on gut feelings to operating with a **data-driven strategy**.

Welcome to **variance analysis**. Let‚Äôs turn that report into your most valuable strategic weapon.

# Part 1: The Fundamentals - What Are We Even Looking At?

Before we start digging for gold, let's make sure we understand the map. A budget vs. actual report is beautifully simple in its components.

* **The Budget:** This is your financial plan, your hypothesis, your ""X marks the spot"" on the treasure map. It‚Äôs what you *expected* to happen based on your best assumptions. It‚Äôs not set in stone; it‚Äôs a benchmark.
* **The Actuals:** This is reality. It‚Äôs the real-world data of what you actually earned and spent over a specific period (usually a month, quarter, or year). This is the path you *actually* walked.
* **The Variance:** This is the difference between your budget and your actuals. It‚Äôs the gap between expectation and reality. And this, my friend, is where the treasure is buried.

The formula is simple:

Variance=ActualAmount‚àíBudgetedAmount

A variance can be:

* **Favorable (Positive):** This happens when actual revenue is *higher* than budgeted, or actual expenses are *lower* than budgeted. Both are good news! You made more or spent less than you planned.
* **Unfavorable (Negative):** This happens when actual revenue is *lower* than budgeted, or actual expenses are *higher* than budgeted. This isn't necessarily ""bad,"" but it‚Äôs a signal that requires your attention.

**Example:** Let's say your coffee shop, ""The Daily Grind,"" budgeted $800 for coffee beans in June. At the end of the month, you check your books and see you actually spent $950.

Variance=$950(Actual)‚àí$800(Budget)=$150

This is a $150 unfavorable variance on your coffee bean expense. Don't panic! This isn't a failure. It's a question. *Why* did this happen? We‚Äôll get to that.



# Part 2: Why This Showdown is a Non-Negotiable Business Practice



Still think this is just for the accountants? Let me convince you otherwise. Regularly performing **variance analysis** is like giving your business a superpower.

1. **It‚Äôs Your Business‚Äôs GPS:** A budget is your route. The actuals are your current location. The variance report tells you if you‚Äôve taken a detour. Without it, you‚Äôre driving blind, hoping you end up at the right destination. This analysis helps you course-correct in real-time, not six months after you've already crashed.
2. **It‚Äôs an Early Warning System:** Did a supplier just hike their prices by 20%? Is your new marketing campaign a total dud? A variance report will scream this at you long before it becomes a catastrophic cash flow problem. It helps you see smoke so you can find the fire before the whole building burns down.
3. **It Uncovers Hidden Opportunities:** This is the treasure hunt. A favorable variance isn‚Äôt just a happy accident to be ignored. Why was your revenue 30% higher than expected? Maybe that new product line is a runaway hit. Maybe your new salesperson is a rockstar. Variance analysis tells you what‚Äôs working so you can *double down on it*.
4. **It Builds Accountability:** When you share variance reports with your team (where appropriate), it creates a culture of ownership. The marketing lead sees the direct impact of their campaigns. The operations manager understands the cost of waste. It connects daily actions to financial outcomes.
5. **It Makes Your Future Budgets Smarter:** Your first budget is your best guess. Your tenth budget, informed by nine periods of variance analysis, is a finely tuned strategic document. You'll learn the true seasonality of your business, the real cost of acquiring a customer, and which expenses are fixed versus which are variable.



# Part 3: The ""How-To"" - Your Step-by-Step Guide to Variance Analysis



Ready to grab your shovel? Here‚Äôs how to conduct a meaningful analysis. Don't just look at the numbers; interrogate them.

**Step 1: Gather Your Tools (The Data)**

You‚Äôll need your **Budget** and your **Actuals** for the same period (e.g., the month of June). Your accounting software (like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave) can generate a ""Budget vs. Actuals"" report with a single click.

**Step 2: Calculate the Variances (Dollar and Percentage)**

The report will likely calculate the dollar variance for you. But the dollar amount alone can be misleading. A $500 variance on a $1,000 budget line is a huge deal (50%!). A $500 variance on a $50,000 budget line is almost irrelevant (1%).

That's why you MUST also calculate the percentage variance. It provides crucial context.

PercentageVariance=BudgetedAmountVariance‚Äã√ó100%

Or, more simply:

PercentageVariance=BudgetActual‚àíBudget‚Äã√ó100%

**Step 3: Set a Significance Threshold**

You don't have time to investigate every single variance. It's a waste of energy to analyze why your office supplies were $10 over budget. **Best Practice:** Set a threshold for investigation. A common rule of thumb is to investigate any variance that is **greater than 10% AND greater than a certain dollar amount (e.g., $500)**. Adjust this based on the size of your business. The goal is to focus your limited time on what matters most.

**Step 4: Ask ""WHY?"" (The Root Cause Analysis)**

This is the most critical step. For every significant variance, you need to dig for the root cause. Don't accept surface-level answers. Use the ""Five Whys"" technique, a classic problem-solving method.

Let's go back to The Daily Grind's $150 unfavorable coffee bean variance.

* **Why #1:** Why did we spend $150 more on beans?
   * *Answer:* Our main supplier increased their price per pound.
* **Why #2:** Why did they increase the price?
   * *Answer:* They said their shipping costs went up due to new fuel surcharges.
* **Why #3:** Why are we so exposed to one supplier's shipping costs?
   * *Answer:* Because we source 90% of our beans from them for a small bulk discount.
* **Why #4:** Why do we rely so heavily on one supplier?
   * *Answer:* It's just easier and we haven't explored other local or regional roasters.
* **Why #5:** Why haven't we explored other options?
   * *Answer:* We haven't made it a priority; we've been focused on marketing.

**Bingo.** The root cause isn't just ""prices went up."" The root cause is an *over-reliance on a single supplier*, which created a business risk. The variance report didn't just tell you that you spent more money; it revealed a strategic vulnerability in your supply chain.



# Part 4: Decoding the Clues - What Your Variances are Screaming at You



Let's look at some common scenarios and what they might be telling you. This is where you put on your detective hat and interpret the **financial insights**.



# Scenario 1: Revenue Variances



* **You Have a Favorable Revenue Variance (You made MORE than planned):**
   * **The Clue:** Sales for your ""Deluxe Package"" were 50% over budget.
   * **Possible Stories:** Did your marketing campaign for this package overperform? Did a key salesperson close a massive deal? Did a competitor stumble, sending customers your way? Was your original sales forecast simply too conservative?
   * **Your Action:** This is gold! Find out exactly what caused this spike and *replicate it*. Pour more resources into that marketing channel. Incentivize the rest of the sales team with the successful salesperson's techniques. This isn't luck; it's a winning formula you've just discovered.
* **You Have an Unfavorable Revenue Variance (You made LESS than planned):**
   * **The Clue:** Overall sales were down 15%.
   * **Possible Stories:** Did a new competitor open up down the street? Was there a seasonal dip you didn't anticipate? Is your pricing now too high for the market? Is your website's checkout process broken, causing abandoned carts?
   * **Your Action:** This is an urgent call to investigate. Talk to your customers and your sales team. Analyze your marketing performance data. A consistent unfavorable revenue variance is a clear sign that your strategy for growth needs a serious re-evaluation.



# Scenario 2: Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) Variances



* **You Have an Unfavorable COGS Variance (It cost MORE to make your product):**
   * **The Clue:** Your COGS as a percentage of revenue was 45% instead of the budgeted 38%.
   * **Possible Stories:** This points directly to eroding profitability. As we saw with The Daily Grind, it could be a supplier price increase. It could also be increased waste on the production line, higher shipping-in costs, or a shift in product mix to lower-margin items.
   * **Your Action:** Immediately analyze your suppliers, production efficiency, and shipping contracts. Can you negotiate better rates? Find a new supplier? Implement processes to reduce waste? If you can't reduce the costs, you may need to consider raising your prices to protect your gross margin.
* **You Have a Favorable COGS Variance (It cost LESS to make your product):**
   * **The Clue:** You spent less on raw materials than planned.
   * **Possible Stories:** Did your team find a way to be more efficient? Did you get an unexpected bulk discount from a supplier?
   * **Your Action:** Investigate to ensure quality hasn't been compromised. If a new, cheaper supplier is the cause, verify the material is up to standard. If it's an efficiency gain, document the new process and make it the new standard operating procedure. Reward the team that found the savings!



# Scenario 3: Operating Expense (OpEx) Variances



* **You Have an Unfavorable OpEx Variance (You spent MORE on operations):**
   * **The Clue:** Your marketing spend was 40% over budget.
   * **Possible Stories:** Was this overspending intentional and strategic (e.g., you saw a huge opportunity and decided to invest)? Or was it uncontrolled (e.g., a ""pay-per-click"" campaign with no budget cap)? Maybe you had an unexpected equipment repair or a software subscription auto-renewed at a higher price.
   * **Your Action:** Differentiate between strategic investments and uncontrolled costs. If the marketing overspend led to a massive favorable revenue variance, it might have been a brilliant move! If it didn't, it was a waste. Put tighter controls in place to prevent future surprises.
* **You Have a Favorable OpEx Variance (You spent LESS on operations):**
   * **The Clue:** You underspent on your software budget by 30%.
   * **Possible Stories:** Did you cancel a subscription you weren't using? Did you find a cheaper alternative? Or... did you *fail* to purchase a critical tool that is now hurting your team's productivity?
   * **Your Action:** A favorable expense variance isn't always good. If you saved money by not hiring a needed employee or not buying necessary tools, it could lead to burnout, lower quality, and bigger problems down the road. Ensure your cost-cutting isn't self-sabotage.

# Part 5: From Insight to Impact - Building Your Data-Driven Strategy

Analysis is worthless without action. The final step is to use these **financial insights** to make smarter decisions.

1. **Update Your Forecast:** The original budget is now history. Based on your variance analysis, create a new ""rolling forecast"" for the rest of the year. If sales are trending 15% higher than planned, adjust your revenue expectations and the expenses required to support them. This gives you a much more realistic view of your year-end results.
2. **Double Down on Winners:** If a specific marketing channel, product, or salesperson is crushing their goals, allocate more resources there. Starve the failures and feed the successes.
3. **Fix the Leaks:** If you identified supply chain vulnerabilities, inefficient processes, or wasteful spending, create a plan to fix them. Assign responsibility to a team member and set a deadline.
4. **Communicate with Your Team:** Share the big picture. Celebrate the wins that favorable variances reveal. Brainstorm solutions for the problems that unfavorable variances uncover. This transforms finance from a back-office function into a team sport.



# Conclusion: You Are the Treasure Hunter



Your budget vs. actual report is not a test you pass or fail. It is your most loyal and honest advisor. It speaks a simple language, telling you exactly where your business is strong and where it is vulnerable. It holds no grudges and plays no favorites.

Stop treating it like a chore. Schedule time every single month to sit down with this report. Pour a cup of coffee, put on your detective hat, and start asking ""why?""

Within those variances‚Äîthe gaps between your plan and your reality‚Äîlie the most valuable treasures you can find: the knowledge and insight to build a smarter, stronger, and more profitable business. Now go start digging.

Mindset- I created/forced the habit of not giving up on myself. What this looks like: even if I binged, and even if it‚Äôs two days after I binged and I still feel really bad- no matter if i ate healthily or unhealthily after, or if I ate alot or if I ate less than usual- I‚Äôve started to push through mentally. I mean when I feel terrible I won‚Äôt listen to my thoughts of self hatred which usually accompany a binge. Like: I‚Äôm disgusting, I‚Äôve ruined everything, I am the worst person, I deserve nothing etc cetera‚Ä¶ So when I have these thoughts I try to acknowledge them but instead of spiraling I try to go do something. I keep moving. I force myself to get up, walk, resume my task, move locations, stretch‚Ä¶ and when I have thoughts that are more like: oh my god what did I just do, what just happened, I can‚Äôt even remember what I ate, am I even full‚Ä¶ I literally stop what I‚Äôm doing and just sit for like until my thoughts change or something feels a bit different, sometimes until I feel worse even. (Then I go get water) it‚Äôs important to catch your breath. Taking your time is super underrated. If you just binged you have to allow yourself at least as much time you spent bingeing on literally just processing what you just did to yourself. 
I‚Äôve tried to be both gentle and militant with myself and this is what‚Äôs working right now.
So tl;dr‚Äî I realized that life keeps on moving, and that I am not going to give up on myself, I am always saveable, the situation is always salvageable, as long as you keep moving, as long as you keep it pushing.

Also, I am sober. The more sober one is the less one will binge. Nicotine and alcohol fuck with the body‚Äôs ability to feel itself, so it gets harder and harder to be able to feel full, or feel anything at all. So that‚Äôs why it might seem like smoking and drinking is the answer, because it numbs you out, but it actually doesn‚Äôt replace bingeing, it never does truly, so if you happen to want to numb yourself with food (bingeing) it‚Äôs going to be a lot harder to know when to stop if you‚Äôre addicted to other substances that inhibit your body‚Äôs ability to process the world. Even coffee, for me, sometimes hits me so wrong that I feel like I need to put something else in my stomach to correct it, when I‚Äôm actually not even that hungry. BUT I will say, I work doubles and sometimes my body is in pain and I am super tired, and I drink green Kratom which feels super calming and I can feel my breathing better. So maybe I‚Äôm a massive hypocrite. But I was bingeing this evening after drinking Kratom and I felt the intense urge to stop and catch my breath. And then I just ate slowly after that. And then I stopped eating. 

Oh and walking. Like just in circles around the house or block. ",2,1753148258.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False
1m6192d,https://i.redd.it/056z6u1exbef1.jpeg,Review #1: Arran - Amarone Cask Finish,"**Arran - Amarone Cask Finish**

**ABV: 100 proof (50%)**

**Price: $86.99 CAD**

**Age: \~8 years**

This is my first post on this subreddit, if you have any feedback, let me know.

I've been a scotch lover going on 8 years now, and while I don't have a substantial collection, I'm happy with the bottles that I have. Today, my review is on an offering from the Arran distillery, the Amarone Cask Finish. This offering coming from the island distillery was finished in casks that were used to make Amarone, a highly regarded Italian wine that is known for being on the drier side of red wines. What makes Amarone so sought out after is the unique process of making it, in which the grapes are dehydrated to increase flavour and aroma. These are the casks that are being used to finish this single malt.

**Nose:** A very light nose, with some tannin like notes akin to a deep red wine. Hints of powdered cocoa, freshly ground coffee with an almost raspberry tartness are also picked up as well.

**Pallate:** A wave of fruits comes in, with cranberry and raspberry tartness leading forward, with an almost citrus like quality akin to lemon rind. Dark chocolate then comes in full force, with an almost faint twizzler-like sweetness riding alongside the dark chocolate. 

**Finish:** The dark chocolate carries through, with overripe banana, hints of vanilla and the aftertaste of a pineapple. Not a long finish, dissipates rather quickly.

**Final Thoughts:** This whisky, while having a light nose, is a delicious and chocolatey offering. The Amarone cask is a super edition to this single malt, creating quite the experience to enjoy. While the finish was kind of short, and the nose was really light, it is a great offering from Arran that I would highly recommend you try.

Looking for advice to make sure I'm not an idiot for quitting. My family is telling me to quit.

In the interview they told me it starts at 8AM, but once I got hired they said come in at 7:30. Found out today we have to spend 30 minutes stocking our cart up and doing laundry, but we dont get to clock in until 8. So 30 minutes unpaid. Actually after typing that out I realized how fucked up it is.

Literally have one rag to use all day for 15+ rooms, we had to wipe and scrub explosive diarrhea out of toilets and then wipe coffee tables and kitchens with the same rag.

They said the manager usually writes down the time we finish, which I am not okay with because I had this at a job in the past where I'd finish at say 5PM and they'd write down that I finished at 4:30PM.

Person training me said to make sure I write down and keep track of my hours because her pay check is usually messed up and last pay they missed 8hrs on her check that she wouldn't have got paid for if she wasnt writing down her hours too.

Basically just looking for advice/opinions because I'm feeling like a huge piece of shit right now. Thanks.",3,1753147975.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

**His arms wrap around me without hesitation‚Äîwarm, solid, real. I feel the pressure of his hands between my shoulder blades, hear the low, familiar laugh against my ear. It‚Äôs him. It‚Äôs really him.**

**I pull back, slowly. My hands press against his chest, as if they‚Äôre checking for seams or stitches. His eyes meet mine, bright as ever, but a little too wide.**

**‚ÄúDude,‚Äù he says, grinning. ‚ÄúYou gonna invite me in or just keep huggin‚Äô me?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI.. how-how are you..‚Äù My brain scrambles. I saw his body, hell, we held a funeral for the guy.**¬†

**And for a moment, I wonder‚Äîmaybe I** ***want*** **this to be real. I look at the empty cans all over my living room table.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou gonna come sit down, buddy?‚Äù He asks, taking another sip from his drink.**¬†

**We all watch as he struggles to think of an answer, looking around the group.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell.. at least you don‚Äôt smell as bad.‚Äù Marcus chuckles. Everyone else follows suit, Jacob shaking his head as he takes another sip from his soda.**¬†

**That part was definitely true. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Jacob never really stank, but he was one of those dudes that needed to wear deodorant, y‚Äôknow? Like, his bo was immediately pungent every day. Now, he doesn‚Äôt smell bad at all. Like wet leaves and plastic. It fades when he moves, but catches in the air when he sits still. It‚Äôs hard not to notice the distinction.**¬†

**The night is a blur of laughter and disbelief. Old stories resurface like no time passed.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù Jacob says, finishing his soda and places it next to my beer on the table. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do it.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù Marcus asks, wiping his face.**

**‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôve gotta be fucking kidding me..‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSam, sit the hell down, bro.‚Äù Marcus chips in from the table.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat place is cursed,‚Äù Liv whispers.**

**Nobody corrects him.**

**‚ÄúLook, I don‚Äôt like it, but if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd really want..‚Äù Kylie says, a deep sigh leaving her as she escapes back into her beer.**¬†

**‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt seem healthy, man..‚Äù Noah says, patting Sams back as he sits back down beside him, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you wanna go home?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI already talked to my folks about it, mom was chill with it.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúChill? Your mom?‚Äù Sam asks, shaking his head.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah, man, she understood, alright?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt get it, bro, why would you possibly wanna go back up there? You literally just got back from.. Well, wherever the hell you were..‚Äù Marcus stands, grabbing for another beer from my kitchen counter.**

**‚ÄúThat‚Äôs exactly man, dude! Maybe if we go up there, I can remember something!‚Äù**

**We all look amongst each other, each waiting for someone to speak some sense into him.**¬†

**‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not kids anymore,‚Äù he says, softer this time. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôve all changed. But it‚Äôd mean a lot to me if we could just go. Just one last time. Like nothing ever happened.‚Äù**

**He‚Äôs looking straight at me now. And something in his face‚Ä¶ not wrong. Just a beat too still.**

**‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù**

**And God help me, I nod.**

**‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Jacob says, smiling wide as he stands up, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get goin‚Äô!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWait, what,‚Äù Lena asks, voice tight. ‚ÄúNow?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù Jacob says, ‚ÄúI should have my things still up there.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWait, why would your things be up there-‚Äù**

**Jacob pats my shoulder and grins. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be good, man. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù**

**I nod weakly, not trusting my voice.**

**Jacob steps toward the door, stretching with a content sigh. ‚ÄúAlright, guess I should get going. I‚Äôve got my bag packed already‚Äîleft it at the house.‚Äù**

**He grabs the handle, then pauses. His tone stays light, offhanded.**

**‚ÄúStill take that left at Miller‚Äôs Creek, yeah? Getting a little turned around here.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I mutter without thinking. ‚ÄúJust past the station.‚Äù**

**He gives a small nod, satisfied. ‚ÄúRight. That‚Äôs what I thought.‚Äù**

**The door shuts behind him with a quiet click.**

**No one says a word for a moment.**¬†

**‚ÄúWait, did he drive here?‚Äù Sam asks. Noah sighs as everyone looks around at each other.**¬†

**‚ÄúI‚Äôll give the dumbass a ride, see y‚Äôall tomorrow..‚Äù He rushes out as we all mumble our goodbyes, closing the door behind him as he puts on his coat.**¬†

**Everyone starts grabbing their stuff, the mood weirdly weightless, like we‚Äôre pretending this isn‚Äôt the most impossible night of our lives. Somehow we‚Äôve all agreed: we‚Äôre going back to the cabin.**

**‚ÄúSo..‚Äù Sam speaks up, ‚ÄúOur friend that we all saw definitely die just came back and now we‚Äôre going back where he died?‚Äù**

**We all just silently nod.**¬†

**‚ÄúGreat. Just wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt** ***losingmyfuckingmind*****,‚Äù He mutters the last part under his breath, ‚ÄúSee you guys tomorrow, I guess.‚Äù He grabs his keys off the table and heads out.**¬†

**‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs actually back..‚Äù Kylie mumbles, slumping back into the couch beside me. She looks at the soda can on the table, her head tilting as her brow burrows together.**¬†

**‚ÄúMe neither..‚Äù I say, leaning back and wrapping my arm around her. She leans into me.**

**‚ÄúI mean..‚Äù Liv starts as Marcus sits down on the love seat. ‚Äú.. I don‚Äôt know what to think, actually.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSame.‚Äù Marcus bellows out with a cough, covering his mouth as he does, eyes wide. We all look over to him and he waves us off, ‚ÄúSorry, heh, just.. I mean what the fuck?‚Äù He sighs while leaning back into the seat. ‚ÄúLike.. no, seriously, what the actual fuck?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYour guess is as good as mine, man..‚Äù I reply.**

**‚ÄúSo like.. What the actual fuck?!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúI know!‚Äù I laugh, though it‚Äôs weak.**

**‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me wrong, this is one of the best days of my life, bro.. But what in the actual FUCK!?‚Äù He shouts this time, we all chuckle. There really was no other words to describe the feeling. What the fuck.**

  
  
  


**The sky‚Äôs still gray when I pull into the lot. Mist clings to the asphalt, thick and low. Kylie‚Äôs already there, leaning against her car, thermos in one hand, cigarette in the other. She‚Äôs bundled up in her big flannel, hood up, fingers tucked in her sleeves to fight the growing chill of fall.**

**She doesn‚Äôt notice me at first. Just stares off down the road.**

**‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù I call from my car as I shut my door.**

**She looks over and gives me a tired smile. ‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù she offers, holding out the thermos.**

**I take it and nod. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù**

**She doesn‚Äôt ask if I slept. She already knows the answer. And I don‚Äôt ask her either.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou okay, hun?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYe-‚Äù I spit out some coffee as I try speaking mid gulp, she grabs the thermos from me as I cough a bit, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm alright, why?‚Äù**

**She smiles as she sits the thermos on her hood. ‚ÄúJust been a while, y‚Äôknow. I-We missed you.‚Äù**

**I had a creeping suspicion the talk would come at some point. At least she waited for us to be alone for it.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah, look, I just.. He died, man. I mean, Jacob fucking died and I..‚Äù I look toward the sky as my eyes scramble for some sort of answer. Her hand guides me back down when it touches my shoulder. I meet her eyes.**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright, hun. Just.. y‚Äôknow, don‚Äôt do it again, alright?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHeh, yeah, alright.‚Äù I smile back.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou can ride with me on the way, get some actual sleep.‚Äù She starts fixing my hair, continuing even as I try swatting her hands away.**

**‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need sleep, I‚Äôm fine-damnit, how are you so fast?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been faster than you, dummy..‚Äù She smiles weakly as she curls a bang on my forehead, one final touch up, ‚Äúalso smarter. You can‚Äôt lie to me, babe. I see those dark buns.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSays the one that didn‚Äôt even notice my car, maybe you should sleep. I‚Äôll drive us.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúFirst, I did notice you, second, there‚Äôs no way in hell I'm letting- wait, how did you drive here- John!‚Äù She starts playfully smacking my body as I flinch away with every word, ‚ÄúYou. can‚Äôt.drink.and.drive!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúHey! We all got drunk last night, lady!‚Äù**

**Liv arrives with Marcus next, climbing out of his car with her hoodie pulled halfway over her face. She waves at us, sheepish, then retreats back into her sleeves. She doesn‚Äôt say anything, just drifts toward Kylie, who wraps an arm around her shoulders like a reflex.**

**Sam rolls in blasting music, shuts it off the second he sees us. He doesn‚Äôt look too thrilled, but at least he‚Äôs here. ‚ÄúNo Jacob yet?‚Äù**

**No one answers as we all look around, ‚ÄúIs Jacob with us right now?‚Äù Marcus asks.**

**‚ÄúNo?‚Äù Sam mutters as he gets out.**¬†

**‚ÄúWell there you go..‚Äù I chuckle lightly.**¬†

**‚ÄúAlright, dick..‚Äù He makes his way over, ‚ÄúDude‚Äôs been dead for two years and he‚Äôs still late to his own damn party.‚Äù He chuckles. Kylie wraps him in a quick hug before looking back at a car on the way down the road.**¬†

**Jacob.**¬†

**Wait, no, it‚Äôs Noah. He pulls in with Jacob‚Äôs truck.**

**Noah steps out, eyes puffy like he didn‚Äôt sleep either. He slams the door too hard and mutters, ‚ÄúMorning.‚Äù as he steps over.**¬†

**Kylie frowns. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Jacob?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSaid he wanted to take his own car,‚Äù Noah says without looking at her. ‚ÄúGrab a few more things. He‚Äôs meeting us there.‚Äù**

**His voice sounds hollow.**

**‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Kylie says, stepping toward him. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúSince when does Jacob have two cars?‚Äù Marcus asks.**

**Noah hesitates. His jaw twitches. ‚ÄúYeah. Just tired.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúAnd why does Jacob have his fucking truck?‚Äù Sam whispers next to us.**

**Kylie lets it drop, but I can see it still working behind her eyes.**

**We load the cars in silence.**

**Sam stands off to the side, arms crossed, scanning the street. ‚ÄúThis still feels wrong,‚Äù he mutters.**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Marcus says, hoisting a duffel bag into the trunk. ‚ÄúSo did seeing him alive again. Guess we‚Äôre just rolling with it at this point.‚Äù**

**Marcus meets my eyes when he says it. Like he‚Äôs checking to see if I‚Äôm actually holding it together. I give him a weak nod and open the passenger side door. My hands are already shaking. Should get the drink out of my bag, but I really don‚Äôt wanna hear about it.**

**We take two cars: Kylie and Marcus‚Äô. Noah and I ride with Kylie. Liv, Sam, and Marcus pile into the second car.**¬†

**‚ÄúI‚Äôll lead!‚Äù Marcus shouts as he starts his car up, immediately pulling out of the parking lot. We leave behind him, Noah nestling his back into the back seat as we pass the edge of downtown, flashing red-and-blues catch my eye.**

**Two cruisers sit at the edge of the street. Yellow tape strung up near the alley behind Lenny‚Äôs. The place has some killer waffles, it‚Äôs the only place ever open past midnight in town.**¬†

**The cars slow down, instinctively.**

**‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Kylie murmurs. ‚ÄúIs that‚Ä¶ blood?‚Äù**

**Something dark stains the pavement beneath the tape. An officer stands near it, looking pale and kinda pissed.**

**Noah leans forward. ‚ÄúWhy are we stopping?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt see that?‚Äù I ask**

**He doesn‚Äôt answer, just sits back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather not make Jacob wait any more than he has to.‚Äù**

**My phone rings before I can retort.**

**‚ÄúYaup.‚Äù I answer Marcus.**¬†

**‚ÄúCan you see anything?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù Kylie asks, now looking at me.**¬†

**‚ÄúMarcus. Uh, no, not really. Some blood-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat does he want?‚Äù She whispers.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah, we saw that. Wonder what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHe‚Äôs asking if we saw anything-Yeah, I don‚Äôt know, man, seems bad enough if they got both cops on it-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he saying?‚Äù She whispers.**¬†

**‚ÄúWould you jus-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs what I was-hey what the hel-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Sam, you don‚Äôt think- get the hell off, damnit, you‚Äôre driving.‚Äù I hear Marcus‚Äôs voice muffled in the background, something about it being his phone. There‚Äôs sounds of a struggle.**¬†

**‚ÄúJust put it on speaker!‚Äù Kylie whispers louder.**

**‚ÄúWhat, no, just chill the hell out, would ya?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Sam asks.**

**‚ÄúNo, not you.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWell what‚Äôd you say- hey get the hell-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat are they saying now?‚Äù She whispers.**

**‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just fighting over the phone.. Probably.‚Äù Noah tells her.**¬†

**‚ÄúLet me listen!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúKylie-would you stop..‚Äù I hold the phone out the window away from here, ‚ÄúDamnit, hey.‚Äù I put it back to my ear, leaning out the window fully, ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm hanging up alright.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhy are you being so weird!‚Äù She shouts, reaching moreso after putting the car in park.**

**‚ÄúWhy are YOU being weird?!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhat? Oh, you‚Äôre hanging up?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúGive me the damn phone!‚Äù Marcus shouts, finally wrestling it back.**¬†

**‚ÄúJohn, you there?‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah, go- just, here, damnit, here!‚Äù I toss the phone in her lap and she lunges for it, pressing her palm into my face as she puts it to her ear with the other. ‚ÄúWhat are you-‚Äù I start smacking it away.**

**‚ÄúSorry, hey, Markie, it‚Äôs me. I know, yeah he was being really weird..‚Äù She smiles, ‚ÄúYeah, alright, We‚Äôll see ya there. Alright, bye, babe.‚Äù**

**She tosses the phone back into my lap and finally lets my face go. I can feel the red in my cheeks starting to calm down.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhat the hell?!‚Äù I shout.**¬†

**‚ÄúOh, hush.‚Äù She pulls the lever back into drive and the car begins going again. ‚ÄúMarcus said hi, by the way.‚Äù**

**I shake my head, looking back to the yellow tape as we leave it behind.**

**It‚Äôs been a couple years since I‚Äôve seen it.**¬†

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**On the highway, we fall into a steady rhythm. Gray sky above trying to reveal the sun, but being stopped by all the thin clouds gathering. Wet trees on either side of the road. Miles stretch on in silence.**

**I check my mirror. Noah‚Äôs still leaning back. But he‚Äôs digging his eyes into the back of Kylie's head.**¬†

**‚ÄúYou uh, you tell Jacob we‚Äôre on the way?‚Äù I ask him, twisting in the seat a bit.**

**‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI said, Did you tell Jacob we were on the way?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh.. he knows, why?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWhy are you asking?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh, I just.. Uh.. I don‚Äôt know man, just trying to make conversation to fill the time, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù**

**‚Äú..Why?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúAlrighty, that conversation is going nowhere..‚Äù I twist back, noticing Kylie's smile, ‚Äú*****Forgot how much of a buzzkill you can be*****, Hey, how much longer?‚Äù I hold my hands together in my lap, the tremors getting worse. I‚Äôll need to stop soon.**¬†

**‚ÄúUh, I don‚Äôt know, Hun, probably soonish.‚Äù Kylie shrugs her right shoulder, making a goofy face with her mouth as she looks on at the road.¬† I slump back with a sigh. Staring ahead, barely able to see Marcus‚Äôs car. I start bobbing my knee, then reach for the radio.**

**‚ÄúMight as well get some-‚Äù The radio blurs out static, causing me to reach for my ears.**

**‚ÄúHoly shi-turn it off, turn it off!‚Äù Kylie winces, gripping the wheel tighter. I use one hand to scroll the knob all the way down. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck..‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúHeh, music just isn‚Äôt what it used to be huh?‚Äù she shakes her head, I know she‚Äôs trying really hard not to laugh. ‚ÄúKinda sounded like that guy you like, what was his-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúD.o.S, are you really saying that sounds like-no, I‚Äôm not giving you the satisfaction..‚Äù She drives a bit more in silence.**¬†

**‚ÄúWhat? I thought it was pretty good! Why so defensive, sheesh!‚Äù**¬†

**‚ÄúYou were always jealous of my lovers, but this is a new low, John.‚Äù She chuckles.**

**‚ÄúSheeet.‚Äù I chuckle, leaning an elbow against the door and looking at the trees as they pass. Time to imagine the ninja man like the good ol days..**

**After a long while, I glance over as the road curves sharply and the trees part. There it is. The cabin, sitting dark and quiet, framed by bare branches scraping the sky. The windows look like empty eyes watching us come back.**

**Marcus‚Äôs car is already sitting in the driveway, alongside an older Sedan. I can‚Äôt put where I remember it from together, but it‚Äôs definitely familiar. As we pull in, Jacob is standing beside Marcus, nodding at us.**¬†

**I twist back real quick, Noah‚Äôs face is unreadable, but his fingers tap nervously on the door handle.**

**We step out, boots crunching on the gravel driveway, and the wind picks up, carrying a faint scent of damp grass.. Along with something metallic.**

**I swallow hard, trying to steady my breath. I can‚Äôt help but shiver against a chill down my spine.**¬†

**We all walk over to the other group, I can‚Äôt help but check on Jacob. But even from this distance, something feels off. His smile is too wide, too still, especially for somebody that was just dead two days ago.**

**‚ÄúOh, Jake, hun, did your mom get a new phone?‚Äù Kylie asks him.**

**He tilts his head, ‚ÄúMom?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah, she hasn‚Äôt been answering me, I wanted to talk to her about-well, you.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúOh, you two get along now, huh? That‚Äôs good to see, dude!‚Äù**

**‚ÄúWe always got along?‚Äù Kylie almost whispers.**

**‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, though, I‚Äôll ask her to reach out to ya.‚Äù She nods, taking that as good enough for now. We all stand as a group, each taking steps onto the porch once more. Jacob extends his arms out wide toward the door.**¬†

**‚ÄúWelcome back,‚Äù he stretches the words, voice smooth, eyes glinting in the fading light.**

**We all exchange uneasy glances as the sky hastens, the trees seeming to close in around us.**

**We really were back.**

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  


**The front door creaks as Jacob pushes it open with a theatrical sweep of his hand.**

**‚ÄúAfter you,‚Äù he grins.**

**Inside, it‚Äôs dark. No lights. No fire. Just cold, stale air pressing against us like we‚Äôre breaking a seal.**

**Marcus moves first. One bootstep over the threshold, then the other. He stops just past the doorway and exhales.**

**The cabin smells like old wood and dried pine. But underneath that, there‚Äôs something else‚Äîwet soil? Old leather? A faint, bitter tinge of iron.**

**I step in next.**

**The living room‚Äôs exactly as we left it.**

**The battered blue couch in the corner, where Marcus once fell asleep with a bag of chips crunched under him. The coffee table with the warped leg and a faint brown ring stain that never scrubbed out. Kylie's old quilt still draped over the backrest, folded too neatly. Even the same magazines sit fanned out on the end table‚Äîsame issue numbers, same tears in the cover. I notice Kylie staring at the couch, frozen in place.**¬†

**There‚Äôs no dust.**

**No cobwebs in the corners.**

**To the left, the kitchenette looks untouched. Cabinets shut tight, counters scrubbed clean. The old kettle we used for popcorn still rests on the stove. And beside it, on the wall‚Äîour old Polaroid photos. Still there. Still pinned in the exact crooked line we left them in. Each having us grow in age alongside them.**¬†

**I walk closer. Each photo is clearer than I remember. Like they‚Äôve been reprinted. The corners are too crisp. The tape is fresh, like it was just stuck on yesterday. I grab one photo of all of us on the dock‚ÄîI swear, Jacob isn‚Äôt** ***blinking,*** **but his face is‚Ä¶ blurred in place.**

**I step back.**

**The hallway leading to the bedrooms is even darker. The doors seem to be cracked open, but I can‚Äôt see much without the daylight from the front door.**¬†

**‚ÄúPlace looks the same,‚Äù Marcus mutters behind me, tapping my shoulder as he walks toward the hall. His voice echoes along the walls, but it sounds deeper.**

**‚ÄúNo dust..‚Äù Sam adds, stepping inside slowly.**

**Liv frowns, arms folded tight across her chest as she surveys the room. ‚ÄúDid someone come up here and clean it?‚Äù she asks, but no one answers.**

**Jacob strolls forward, casual as ever, heading to the fireplace. He kneels down, stacking a few logs like it‚Äôs a normal Friday night.**

**‚ÄúYou‚Äôve already come up here,‚Äù Kylie says, watching him. ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He shrugs. ‚ÄúI-well, just this morning. Got here extra early to clean the place up for us, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù**

**Click. He strikes a match. The fire sputters and pops to life, casting flickering orange across the room.**

**And for a second, it feels warm again. Familiar. I can feel the chill leave me as Noah closes the door behind him, setting a bag off his shoulder onto the ground.**

**‚ÄúMake yourselves at home,‚Äù Jacob says, standing back and dusting off his hands. That damn smile still stuck to his face like it‚Äôs been painted there.**

**We linger in the living room a minute longer, standing around like strangers at our own funeral. Then Marcus claps his hands once, loud and final.**

**‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúCall your beds. I‚Äôm not sleeping on the damn couch.‚Äù**

**That breaks it. Sam groans and heads for the hall, Liv following close behind with her duffel bag clutched to her chest. Marcus ruffles her hood as she passes. She still doesn‚Äôt say much, but the way she glances toward the old bunk room says enough. That was always her spot.**

**Noah crosses the room and flicks on the hallway lights. He jolts for a moment, almost like he didn‚Äôt expect them to work.**¬†

**The bulbs buzz to life. They‚Äôre a little too dim, but enough to cut through the dark. The hallway stretches long, carpet still matted in the same places from years of pacing feet. Dust motes float in the air, catching the light like ash.**

**Marcus takes the room on the right with the broken dresser. He always did. Says it ‚Äòbuilds character.‚Äô Whatever the hell that means.**¬†

**Sam disappears into the room across from him without a word.**

**I move to grab my bag back off the ground, but Kylie‚Äôs already got it slung over her shoulder.**

**‚ÄúI got it,‚Äù she says, smirking a little. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stronger than you, remember?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúStronger, huh?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúAlways have been, babe.‚Äù She bumps me lightly with her hip, then heads toward the hall, calling back, ‚ÄúYou still want the loft, or you taking the bunks?‚Äù**

**I shake my head, grabbing her three bags and follow close behind her. ‚ÄúLoft‚Äôs mine. Good one, by the way.‚Äù I snark, my breathing getting a bit ragged.**

**The loft is in the last room on the left. It was the smallest in the cabin, made to be a closet, tucked beneath the angled ceiling, but it‚Äôs got a window that faces the lake, a desk just beside it and just enough room for a mattress along with a nightstand. We spent an entire weekend repurposing it when we were younger. Pretty sure the walls are thicker.**¬†

**Kylie tosses the bag down at the edge of the mattress and turns to face me, brushing her raven shined hair back from her face. The light from the hall throws a soft glow across her grassy eyes and for a second, I feel like I'm Seventeen again.**¬†

**‚ÄúI think it still has that smell,‚Äù she says, wrinkling her nose. ‚ÄúLike cheap deodorant and body axe.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúCould be worse,‚Äù I say, trying to hide my grin. ‚ÄúCould smell like Mark‚Äôs gym bag.‚Äù**

**She snorts. ‚ÄúSame thing.‚Äù**

**I subtly rock back and forth on my feet, not quite ready to leave the moment.**

**‚ÄúYou doing okay?‚Äù she asks after a beat, voice quieter now. ‚ÄúI mean it. You‚Äôve been kind of‚Ä¶ ghosty lately. And not the cute Casper kind.‚Äù**

**I exhale through my nose and lean back against the leaning ceiling ‚ÄúI dunno. Being here‚Äôs weird. He‚Äôs here, y‚Äôknow? Like nothing happened. But something definitely did. And I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. Like, my best friend died two years ago, Kai, two years ago they brought his damn body up here, now he‚Äôs back and acting like nothing happened and we‚Äôre back here and I haven‚Äôt had a drink and-‚Äù**

**She stands and rests a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúHey, hey..‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI mean, are we all just gonna ignore the fact he doesn‚Äôt look like he‚Äôs aged a day? Or how he‚Äôs acting like nothing happened? It‚Äôs been two years, what the actual fuck are we doing here?‚Äù**

**Kylie bites her lip and glances toward the door ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not ignoring it. We‚Äôre just‚Ä¶We all needed this.‚Äù**

**She pauses.**

**‚ÄúI needed this.‚Äù**

**I look at her, really look at her. The worry behind her eyes. The way she‚Äôs trying to hold the group together like she always has. And the way she looks at me, like maybe she still sees something in me I‚Äôm not sure is there anymore.**

**‚ÄúDamnit, Kai, I‚Äôm..‚Äù I say, softly. ‚ÄúThanks. For the coffee. For being here.‚Äù**

**Her gaze lingers on mine, warm and unreadable. ‚ÄúOf course, Hun. I never left..‚Äù**

**We both smile a little too long at that, and the silence that follows feels charged.**¬†

**She shifts slightly, her arm brushing mine as she turns toward the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go help Liv unpack. Try not to stay in here for too long, okay?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúCan‚Äôt make any promises.‚Äù**

**Kylie stops in the doorway, half-smiling over her shoulder. ‚ÄúGood. I like a man that can keep me guessing.‚Äù**

**Then she‚Äôs gone, her footsteps padding down the hall.**¬†

**‚ÄúYo, Kylie, look at this shit..‚Äù I hear Marcus try to whisper as she passes his door. I close the door behind her.**¬†

**I stand there for a while, heart weirdly full, head still spinning. I glance around the loft‚Äîsame ceiling stains, same warped wood panels‚Äîbut somehow it feels smaller now. Or maybe I‚Äôm just bigger.**¬†

**I can‚Äôt help but explore the room, placing a hand against the window, looking out toward the dying sun beyond the tree line. I try to open it, but strain. I duck down, noticing the hinges bolted shut. I could‚Äôve sworn we used to leave it open. I‚Äôm half tempted just to take the glass out, but it‚Äôs way too thick to bother. Smashing a window might not be the best idea right now, anyways.**¬†

**With a deep sigh, I turn to the desk, yanking the old school chair back and pulling the middle chore open. Ergonomics 101. I grab the book and open the front page with a smile, noting all the lame notes Jacob had written through it. The top of the page has the title crossed out, replaced with ‚ÄòGetting bitches 169‚Äô. I can‚Äôt help but chuckle lightly when I notice all the times he obviously erased the word bitches to spell it right. I toss the book on the desk and look at the walls for a bit.**

**Eventually I sit down on the mattress and crack open my bag. My clammy hands struggling to dig through it quick enough, grasping at the flask deeper inside.**¬†

**I feel my breath leave as I twist the top off, finally getting the sweet tangy feeling once more. Everything is right again. My mind clears up, the temperature drops in the room, my face stops sweating. Thank god for whatever I put in this thing.**¬†

**I take a longer swig, cutting myself off midway and closing the metal cap. Can‚Äôt lose myself tonight, gotta pace it out. At least until tonight.**

**Outside, I hear laughter. Sam shouting something about who‚Äôs cooking. Liv‚Äôs soft laugh. And somewhere in it all‚ÄîKylie‚Äôs voice, smooth and bright.**

**Like always.**

**Stop. Stop that. I uncap the flask and take another swig. Alright.**¬†

**I take another swig then tighten the cap, scrapping my hand as I keep trying to make it tighter. I really don‚Äôt need anymore. Not right now.**

**The fifth sip goes down much lighter.**¬†

**Now I can put it‚Äî**

**The door swings open and slams into the wall with enough force to rattle the frame.**

**‚ÄúYo, you coming out or-‚Äù**

**Marcus freezes, hand hanging on the top of the door.**¬†

**We lock eyes.**

**He sees the flask before I can tuck it behind me. His eyes land on it, then on me. That quiet calculation behind them shifts into something harder.**

**I lower it slowly, putting it into the bag and laying it on the ground.**¬†

**He doesn‚Äôt say anything right away. Just closes the door behind him with a soft click.**

**‚ÄúUnpacking, huh?‚Äù he says, voice low.**

**I sigh, trying to keep it light. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a little-‚Äù**

**‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù he cuts me off, stepping forward. ‚ÄúGive it here.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs empty.‚Äù I lie.**

**‚ÄúGreat, makes it a no brainer then.‚Äù**

**I sigh.**¬†

**He scoffs. ‚ÄúMan, you‚Äôve been gone for months. Barely answer any of our texts. Your house is full of fucking beer cans and empty pizza boxes. You show up to the lot this morning smelling like you crashed in a bar bathroom, and now I walk in and see you sneaking a drink like we‚Äôre in the back of my moms van?‚Äù**

**‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal.‚Äù My voice cracks sharper than I meant.**

**Marcus stares at me for what feels like forever.**¬†

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be your mom, alright? That's Kylie's job,‚Äù he says, sitting on the arm of the old desk near the window. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs been two years, John. Two. You think none of us were hurt when Jacob died?‚Äù**

**I look down at the bag.**

**‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what to do, man.. i've been seeing the guy in my dreams every fuckin night. I can't even wake up without having a damn panic attack. It was the only way I could.. I didnt wanna be around you guys when I'm like this. Like him.‚Äù**

**He leans forward, ‚ÄúHey. You are not him. Hell, you think I‚Äôm fine? I still remember that call every night.. The way Sammy was pacing back and forth in the kitchen. I still see Liz‚Äôs eyes when they were loading up his body.‚Äù**

**Marcus reaches out and takes it from my hand. I didn't even realize I pulled the damn thing back out.**¬†

**He walks over to the larger window, trying to open it. He looks at me after noticing the bolts.**¬†

**‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt know..‚Äù**¬†

**He puts the flask in his pocket.¬† ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDinner‚Äôs happening. Kylie‚Äôs making that pasta mess she likes and Jacob said he‚Äôs grilling. Which is already weird, since he always hated grilling.‚Äù**

**‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we even have a grill out here..‚Äù**

**‚ÄúHeh, we don‚Äôt. Dude‚Äôs fuckin‚Äô weird. But I guess that‚Äôs what happens when you die for two years.‚Äù**

**He heads for the door, then pauses.**

**‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù**

**I hesitate.**

**But then I nod.**

**‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I say, standing slowly. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm coming.‚Äù I dust off my legs, grabbing the bag as I stand fully and tossing it on the bed. I‚Äôll unpack after.**¬†

**I follow him down the hall, noting all the doors are closed.**

**And my hands grasp together, the flask staying behind for some damn reason.**
