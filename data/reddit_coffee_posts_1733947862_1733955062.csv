","Life has been a bit crazy recently so I thought I'd come online to try and find a potential friend who I can hang with every now and again..

I will say though, I am pretty high energy & no filter and I'm not too serious so if you're not okay with that -- probably best to stay away!

My interests are: Music, Dance/Fitness, Skincare/Fashion, Video Games (currently thinking about doing a Minecraft for full escapism), Language Learning, Cooking/Baking, Coffee/Drinks!

I do have other hobbies but I'd say the above are probably all my main ones :) Also!-- I am from the UK but my sleep schedule can be pretty scuffed sometimes so I'm happy to chat to people from anywhere in the world :)

Btw---! I use discord primarily so it's preferred and please be 18+ annd finallyyy, please do not spam me if I don't reply in 15 seconds...!! I will try my best to get back to everyone <3",1,1733954469.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1hc5bhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1hc5bhh/aita_for_going_everywhere_with_my_friend_even/,"AITA for going everywhere with my friend, even though we’re both in relationships? ","I (26F) have a job that requires frequent trips with my coworkers, and over time, we’ve become close friends. One of them, Ian (26M), and I get along really well. We share personal things, partly because we have mutual friends. 

My friend and co worker has a girlfriend of Seven months, Anna (23F), while I’ve have a two-year relationship with my boyfriend, Jonathan (24M). 

Jonathan does not enjoy going out much, to dates, concerts or crowded spaces. While I respect his boundaries and it doesn’t usually bother me, it can feel isolating doing many things I love alone so my friend Ian and I with another friend Max (28M) started doing some of these activities together outside of work. Since they had no one to go out with. And also It felt natural cause we have to go to frequent work trips where all of us have to share an apartment.

On a recent work trip, there was a mix-up, and Ian and I ended up sharing a room with two beds. We were a little uncomfortable at first but we let it slide because we were not going to spend money on another room on the middle of the night and the sofa was already taken by one of our co workers. 

After working till 4 am, we were on our beds and I couldn’t sleep due drinking too much coffee, so I asked Ian to chat with me. He brought me a blanket, sat on my bed, and eventually layed next to me while we talked, previously on the trip I had told some of my co workers some issues I had with my boyfriend, so we ended up talking about that and he told me I should talk to him and set my boundaries straight cause in his eyes my bf was not putting enough effort on our relationship.

He encouraged me to speak up more, and then said he wanted to hug me. I found it sweet and natural, so I hugged him. He hugged me back, and then we both went back to our separate sleeping arrangements 

The next night, we also slept late because of work, and Ian said he couldn’t sleep and wanted to chat. Though I was tired, I decided to talk to him. He asked me to sit on his bed so he could give me a blanket. We chatted briefly, and then he asked for a goodbye hug. I hugged him while sitting on his bed, and we went back to sleep in separate ways. The next day, he was very cold and distant, which confused me, but I didn’t bring it up.

A week ago we had another work trip, I lucked out and got a single room. But Ian and I still ended up chatting during the trip due to work. 

And at one point, he fell asleep while working, so I put a blanket over him and kept working nearby. When he woke up, he grabbed my arm while half-asleep while the team and I ended up chatting till I went back to my room. 

This is where I may be TA. On the way back, we had to squeeze into a cramped car with all our equipment. I was exhausted and ended up falling asleep on Ian’s legs. (Literally falling) And he  put his hand on my waist, saying it was to keep me from falling off the seat and I just let that happen because I didn’t think much of it.

A couple of days later back home , our mutual friend canceled on us, and Ian and I spent the day together exploring a small village we wanted to meet with some of his family. We had a lot of fun and even playfully danced a little to the local music.

  Just before he and his family drove me home he told me he needed to say something important to me, and brought up my relationship. He told me I should think about whether my boyfriend is putting in enough effort because he and others can see that I’m not being treated the way I deserve and hugged me goodbye. 

I don’t have romantic feelings for Ian, and I don’t think he’s trying to make a move, but AITA for spending all of this time and  getting in these situations with Ian?

Monday came faster than the Red Panda wanted as he dragged himself out of bed and went to his closet and took out his new uniform for Private School. He hated wearing clothes, they were scratchy and made him hot, it especially didn’t help that it was August. He angrily put it on but got rid of the bowtie. He then walked into the bathroom, got a stool and began washing up by brushing his fur.

Sody: This Is Stupid! Why Do I Have To Go To A Private School? Was I Really That Bad? I Mean, Who Here Hasn’t Burned Their House Down At Least Once?

He grabbed some soap and began washing his face.

Sody: it also doesn’t help that school is gonna suck! Thanks to Iscream!

**FLASHBACK**

Fwench Fwy was tucking Sody in and playfully booped his nose. They and Iscream were about to leave the room when Sody called out.

Sody: uh.. Guys?

Fwench Fwy: yeah?

Sody: Do you think… will school be okay?

Fwench Fwy: oh, I’m sure your going to be fi-

Iscream: nah, you’re screwed. I’ve seen 5 year olds bigger than you, they're gonna eat you alive, give you wedgies, lock you in lockers, steal your lunch money, oh! And kick your as-

Fwench Fwy finally covered Iscream’s mouth, then dragged them out by the ears to give them a good talking to, leaving the traumatized Sody alone.

Sody: oh, buttcheeks….

**END OF FLASHBACK**

Sody: last time I ever ask them for advice.

He walked back into his room and noticed his duffle bag sitting in his closet and he got an idea.

**\*IN THE KITCHEN\***

Slushy was making breakfast, she smelled the chocolate chip pancakes and happily put them on a plate. She then began making a lunch for Sody, she made him a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, cut into triangles with no crust. An orange and sliced apples, chocolate milk and a Twix bar. Before she closed his lunchbox, she added a not she wrote into it just as Sody walked in, no uniform and carrying his duffle bag.

Slushy: Sody? Why aren’t you dressed? Fwench Fwy will be here any minute to take you to school!

Sody: oh, I’m not going! I’m 10 years old, and I know this is child abuse.

Slushi: Child what now?

Sody: yeah, forcing a child to face massive torture.

Slushi: it’s just school, Sody. Private School is literally just like public school! Except Private school is a tad more strict.

Sody: I know, so I’m running away! You were a good big sis, but I must leave! Now!

Slushi grabbed his big head and plopped him onto a chair.

Sody: Let Me Go!

Slushi: Sody, I’m not gonna let you run out there with no one watching you. You will be fine, now eat.

She placed a plate of pancakes on the table. Sody sighed and began eating.

Sody: just pancakes? Not a big breakfast like they do in movies?

Slushi: you took a shower in the dishwasher yesterday! There was no soap so I couldn’t do the dishes.

Sody: At Least I Showered!

Slushi: But Aren’t You Excited? It’s School! \*gasp\* I Am Turning Into My Mom! All I’m missing is a weird craving for ketchup on my eggs…

Sody: be honest, you all sending me to private school because I messed up the house yesterday, right?

Slushi: not all because of that, your mom’s boss’s brother runs it and she thought it would be good for you.

Sody: I was doing fine at public school!

Slushi: you tried to burn it down… 5 times in the same week!

Sody: and I don’t regret a single thing!

Slushi: all I’m saying is that you need to grow up, your not a little kid anymore.

She turned around to wash her paws but when she turned back around, Sody was gone.

Slushi: oh, and remember, I will get you aft- and where did you go?

Slushi sighed and leaned onto the counter, she looked at the time, 7:34, he had 26 minutes before school started, Fwench Fwy was probably on their way, he hadn't eaten yet, wasn’t dressed yet and she had to deal with it all. She went to his duffel bag and opened it to see mostly toys and pictures in there, along with his uniform. She suddenly got an idea, she grabbed a paintbrush and some paint and got to work.

—---------------------------------------------

Slushy opened Sody’s door but didn’t see him. That’s when she saw his little feet poking from under his bed. She smirked and grabbed his favorite plushie of a cat, named “ Calico” and sat on his bed.

Slushi: you know it’s rude to leave when someone’s talking to you?

No response, so she placed the toy on the floor.

Slushi: the cat will self destruct if you don’t take it in three, two, o-

A brown paw snatched it and it disappeared under the bed. She crawled under the bed right next to Sody Pop.

Slushi: why did you run off? Fwenchie will be here any second, and you know how they are when your a second late to something.

Sody: I-I really don’t want to go…

Slushi: why not? I know something’s bothering you, you can trust your big sis.

Sody: It’s just, I know this is a punishment, and I deserve it…

Slushi: Sody, we are not punishing you, we’re doing this because Private school is a tad more stricter and you need to control all that energy in that small little body.

Sody: I guess you're right… B-But You Won’t Be There! A-And The School Is Huge!

Slushi: don’t worry, the school has your mom’s phone number in case of anything, I even secretly gave them mine too, just in case. \*winks\*

Sody smiled but frowned again and threw his toy away. Slushi grabbed him and they both got out of under the bed and she laid down and let Sody lay on her.

https://preview.redd.it/9r6lp85dja6e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=af59b627595e8d7cc21ca31fcd303c6a7f94d7d1

Sody: I just hear so many scary stories about private school, that they have lots of bullies, the teachers are mean, lots of homework and the teachers beat you-

Slushi: gonna stop you right there, the teachers will not put a paw on you, or they will have to deal with us! Trust me, one look from Fwench Fwy and the soul will be sucked from them!

Sody and Slushi giggled just as the doorbell rang.

Slushi: and it seems we summoned them!

Sody laughed at that.

Slushi: come on! Can’t be late!

They began to crawl away when Slushi wrapped her arms around the red panda.

Slushi: One More Hug For The Road!

They laughed and rolled from under the bed and stood up. Slushi then grabbed his uniform and showed it to him. He gasped seeing a big S in the middle.

Sody: Wow! S For Sody!

Slushi: so you will still be a tad different. Now, come on.

\*DING,DONG\*

Slushi: It’s Only Been A Minute!

Fwench Fwy: One Minute To Long!

Slushi rolled her eyes and led Sody to the door. Then gave him his lunch and opened the door to see Fwench Fwy there.

Fwench Fwy: ‘Morning!

Slushi: morning!

Sody: Morning!

Fwench Fwy: you ready to go, buddy?

Sody: uh.. Y-yeah….

Slushi pushed him out the door and grabbed Fwench Fwy’s claw before they walked away.

Slushi: Can you talk to him? He’s a little nervous.

Fwench Fwy: I can try, I have never been to school, didn’t even know what it was until Sody told me 2 years ago.

Slushi: just try and keep him from panicking.

Fwench Fwy: oh, got it! \*winks\*

They rushed to catch up with Sody who wasn’t that far away.

Sody: why can’t I walk alone?

Fwench Fwy: because we’re terrified of you being kidnapped.

Sody: if someone tries I’ll explode them.

Fwench Fwy: I know but, you're only a kid.

Sody: I’m 10.

Fwench Fwy: uh, last time I checked, you're a kid! And kids have a lot of emotions, like you do.

Sody: You can tell?

Fwench Fwy: clear as day.

Sody: why do you care? You were mad yesterday.

Fwench Fwy: Okay, I may get mad at you, but I could never be mad forever.

Sody: but yesterday it looked like you were trying everything not to smack me.

Fwench Fwy: I got pushed past my limit a little. But I would never, ever hurt you or the others. But anyway, back to you, there is nothing to be nervous about.

Sody: But the school is huge! And that’s weird because ain’t the classrooms small?

Fwench Fwy: Sody, if you keep thinking of bad stuff, it’s gonna ruin your mood and a ruined mood equals a ruined day and a ruined day means it’s gonna be hard to look after you.

Sody: it already is, I don’t mean to be a burden and trouble, I just-

Fwench Fwy grabbed Sody’s tail to stop him from walking just as a speeding car came by.

Fwench Fwy: **HEY! LEARN TO DRIVE!!! OR I WILL SEND YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL YOU LITTLE SHIiiii-**

Fwench Fwy looked at Sody who was listening to every word. Fwench Fwy looked back at Sody and began acting like a mature role model again.

Fwench Fwy: forget everything I just said! And lets carefully cross the road.

This time it was Sody grabbing Fwench Fwy’s tail so they didn’t get hit by a car.

Fwench Fwy: where is everyone going? What’s the rush?

Sody: can’t you just fly me there?

Fwench Fwy: \*sigh\* this one time.

They let Sody hop on their back and they grabbed his tiny feet.

Fwench Fwy: comfy?

Sody: Yep!

Fwench Fwy: Good!

They flew up in the air and began flying toward the school. Sody looked down in awe since everything looked so small.

Sody: Wow!

Fwench Fwy: cool, right?

Sody: Awesome! I Wish I Could Fly!

Fwench Fwy: well I need to follow some rules for flying, like make sure I don’t run into birds, airplanes, toy planes. I also need to make sure I’m not flying to high or to low, and I need to-

Sody: pay attention?

Fwench Fwy: yeah? How’d you know?

Sody: because you’re not.

Fwench Fwy: huh? WHOA!

They came to a sudden halt as they were about to smash right into the school. They laughed nervously as they landed on the ground.

Fwench Fwy: I-I Meant To Do That!

Sody patted Fwench Fwy’s shoulder.

Sody: Sure you did.

He looked at the huge school and gulped.

Sody: okay.. Much bigger than I thought….

Fwench Fwy turned Sody around and placed their claws on his shoulder.

Fwench Fwy: look at me, your going to be fine! And I will be here at 3:06 to pick you up.

Sody wrapped his tiny arms around Fwench Fwy who returned the hug.

https://preview.redd.it/bmfa56imja6e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=5223d9ede7645b8d0620280642bf0c7c3cc7be60

Sody didn’t notice someone in the bushes, watching him.. Smiling. Fwench Fwy gently kissed his forehead.

Fwench Fwy: remember, positive attitude!

Sody: O-okay…

Sody began climbing the stairs and before he entered the school, he looked back to see Fwench Fwy smiling and waving at him. He waved back and entered the school. Fwench Fwy waited for him to go in before walking back to their house. The figure in the bush walked out and it turned out to be a little deer who galloped inside. That’s when Fwench Fwy passed by a tree where a huge figure was. It suddenly pulled out a radio.

???: got eyes on the dragon, they’re alone. Should I- but they're alone, they can’t be that feisty, can they? The demigod failed! Yes… alright, I’ll watch these little animals a little longer… just a bit longer…

It continued to watch Fwench Fwy walk, they never knew they were being watched.

—------

Students were walking around the school, waiting for the bell. The school had a fancy look, it had pillars, fancy lockers and all the students looked smart and were choosing to read. The door suddenly slammed open and Sody Pop came in, holding a boombox with orange glasses on. He danced down the hallway while kids were looking at him, some even singing alone to the song. That’s when someone grabbed his boombox and crushed it with his giant hand. It was the principal, Soi Sauce’s brother who has an eyepatch over one of his eyes.

Sody: Hey!

Mr. Fride Rice: No Playing Your Rap Music! It’s Distracting The Other Students From Learning!

Sody looked over his glasses.

Sody: and you are?

Mr. Fride Rice: I am your new principle and you just earned yourself a detention.

Sody: WHA- IT’S MY FIRST DAY!

Mr. Fride Rice: sorry little orange football, you're in my school now. And we are very, very strict!

Sody: Well I guess you caught me.. But I am leaving right after that last bell rings!

Mr Fride Rice: and why would I let you do that?

Sody leaned against a locker.

Sody: You see, I know a certain dragon who will rip you apart. They seem sweet and kind and most times they are, but they can really get mad!

Mr Fride Rice: your mother already informed me about your weird little friends, and I already sent them all a letter about our rules and if they have questions to email me.

Sody: Wait, how do you know my mother?

Mr Fride Rice: my brother, her boss convinced her to send you here because you are a demon sent from hell. See!

He shoved a picture of Sody Pop in the Red Panda’s face and Sody took it.

https://preview.redd.it/piief61sja6e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c7edeb4c6d5c04c2061a878b544f5c403cd543a

Sody: Okay, you literally somehow got a picture from when I was in Second Grade and wrote the words Demon From Hell on it!

Mr. Fride Rice: that’s not the point. My point is, I’ve got my eyes on you….

Sody: Whatever, if you excuse me, I’m gonna find the art room.

Mr. Fride Rice: yeah, that’s not on your schedule.

Sody Pop stopped dead in his tracks.

Sody: Why!?

Mr. Fride Rice: you didn’t request that class. This is your schedule.

He tossed Sody a small piece of paper and the Red Panda read it.

https://preview.redd.it/71tr9lpxja6e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=df1178713c1fbde05d80dad2b6d1c2750c56596c

Sody: your Kidding Me, Right!?

Mr. Fride Rice: sorry kid.

\*RING\*

Sody: WHA- B-But-

Mr. Fride Rice: Off You Go!

He pushed Sody forward who sighed and began looking for his English class.

—--------

Sody finally found the class and a teacher welcomed him in. Sody felt his heart race seeing other kids already in the class, talking, reading or playing on their phone. He felt nervous all over again since he was the only new kid. He also realized how he didn’t even know how to socialize with kids his own age since he usually hanged with his mom or the gang who were all adults. He has never played with a child, he was never on any playdates as a toddler and his mother never stayed in contact with her friends from high school. He just knew everyone would see him as an exploding weird kid. He sighed and sat in a desk in the back corner of the class, he got teary eyed, missing his old school and of course the gang. He tried to remember Slushi and Fwench Fwy’s supportive words but he was still nervous. That’s when two shadows appeared over him. He looked up to see 2 cats that looked similar to Cheezborger but smaller, about his age.

Katsup: Who are you?

Sody: M-M-me?

Katsup: no, the cupboard- Yes We’re Talking To You!

Sody flinched and backed away.

Meowstard: Stop! You're Scaring Him!

She placed her paw on Sody’s shoulder.

Meowstard: hey, it’s alright. We may be cats but we don’t bite.

Katsup: I Might!

Meowstard rolled her eyes, she was always annoyed by her brother.

Meowstard: I’m Meowstard and this is my twin brother, Katsup. He’s… something.

Katsup: is that a compliment?

Meowstard: sure, bro…

Katsup: Anyway, welcome to the school!

Sody: thank you..

Katsup: well what’s your name? We introduced ourselves, it’s only fair you do the same!

Sody: oh, my name’s Sody Pop.

Meowstard: Sody pop.. \*gasp\* OUR BIG SISTER KNOWS YOU!!!

Sody: she… does?

Katsup: Yeah! Her Name’s Cheezborger!

That’s when it finally clicked, Sody remembered Chee telling him and Chikn about her younger siblings.

Sody: I-I Remember! She Wanted To Introduce Us!

Meowstard: But knowing her she must have forgotten, but we were so excited to meet you! Is it true you can explode?

Sody: Yep! That’s Why My Last Name Is Pop!

Katsup:Can You Do It Right Now?!

https://preview.redd.it/z9prznbbka6e1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8150b764094ff544cbb0cf402109802c91c18e

Meowstard elbowed him.

Meowstard: If He Explodes, He’ll Get Into Trouble!

Katsup: And, We Won’t Have School!

Meowstard: Can You Use Your Brain For Once? 

Sody: uh, do you guys need a sec?

Katsup: forgive my know it all sister. But wait, why are you here? You had a reputation at the public school.

Sody: my mom’s boss gave her the idea to send me here because everyone calls me a “Demon Sent From Hell”. I miss the gang, they are my only friends…

Katsup and Meowstard looked at each other, then Meowstard got an idea. She went into her bag and pulled out a pencil and piece of paper.

Meowstard: we have about 30 seconds until class starts, but maybe you can make them a picture? You like drawing, right?

Sody: I do, a lot!

Katsup: mind if we sit with you?

Sody nodded and moved his bag and the two sat down just as the bell rang. He smiled, maybe school wouldn’t be so bad with a couple of friends.

**\*AT CHIKN’S HOUSE\***

Chikn was playing a video game but wasn't really paying attention. all his senses were on high alert as he kept jumping at the littlest sounds. Cheezborger and Cofi were on his couch, watching him, faces full of worry. Slushy was drawing next to him but found herself just watching him play. Fwench Fwy was in his kitchen trying to find something to make for breakfast but he had nothing. They opened the fridge.

Fwench Fwy: this dog has nothing in here but Chicken Nuggets and diet soda! How is he alive?

Iscream was chowing down on some Chicken Nuggets they found.

Iscream: it's not that bad, you really like French Fries.

Fwench Fwy shut the fridge and crossed their arms.

Fwench Fwy: So what if I like them? Do I have our fridge stocked up on them? no! I have real food!

Iscream: then tell him to go shopping!

Fwench Fwy: he can't! you know he can't! after the.. incident...

Iscream went into the fridge and got themselves a bottle of diet soda.

Iscream: you mean when he got banned from all stores in the area?

Fwench Fwy: SHHH!!! he might hear you! he's got those big ears!

Chikn did indeed hear them, he honestly didn't really care, he hated going to the store, too many people petted him like he was a wild dog but now... not even kids went near him.

Fwench Fwy: I can't make anything here, how about we go to the diner across town? I heard they have an arcade!

Iscream: eh, why not?

Fwench Fwy and Iscream left the kitchen and went into the Living Room where their friends were.

Fwench Fwy: Hey Guys! Chikn doesn't have.. anything here, so we'll go to the diner across town!

Slushy: Ooh! Fun!

Cofi: I’m down.

Chee: I don't think I've ever been to a diner before, what's it like?

Slushi: like a Restaurant, but smaller, and ruder.

Fwench Fwy noticed Chikn still playing his game. they waved their claws across his face. Chikn ignored them as he was busy fighting with the NPC. but as he saw the wolf he was playing as, keep scratching the lion, he began trying to block out a horrible memory.

**\*FLASHBACK\***

Chikn stammered back, tears streaming down his face as he sobbed. his paw shook but his claws were unleashed and it had blood... Cheezborger's blood. Chee was on the ground, crying while holding her cheek. she had tried to talk to him when she found him crying and he seemed to snap and attack her. Chikn didn't know what to do, should he run? stay still? try to apologize? fight if she made any moves? After a long horrible agonizing silence, Chee broke it.

Chee: C...Chi...Chikn...?

Chikn was shaking, feeling his world crumble. He hadn't meant to do it, he was just mad that she wouldn't leave him alone.. he never meant to hurt her....

Fwench Fwy: CHIKN!? WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO!?

Chikn yelped and turned around, seeing an enraged Cofi and Fwench Fwy and the rest of his friends shocked. This was too much, so he got on all fours and bolted away, crying. He thought he heard Chee call out his name, but he knew she hated him, they all hated him.

**\*END OF FLASHBACK\***

Fwench Fwy unplugged his T.V, which woke him from his mind.

Chikn: Hey!

Fwench Fwy: did you hear anything we said?

Chikn: uh, bla bla bla?

Fwench Fwy groaned and rolled their eyes. They then ruffled his little tuft of fur sticking out on his head and stood him up.

Fwench Fwy: we're going to a diner and you are coming.

Chikn: do I have to?

Fwench Fwy: yes, come on, please?

Chikn stayed silent, but this didn't shock his friends. He was now always quiet, he rarely spoke. this wasn't the Chikn they knew and loved, he was changing, and it scared them.

**\*AT THE DINER\***

Chikn watched as someone in the kitchen flipped some pancakes. He was sitting next to the window, elbows on the table while he had scrambled eggs and 2 pieces of bacon on a plate, and had some diet soda with a yellow bendy straw. Chee was sitting next to him, she just had 2 sunny side up eggs and some Greek Yogurt and had regular soda to drink. Cofi was flirting next to her girlfriend while eating Avocado Toast and drinking Coffee. Slushi had 2 Breakfast Burritos while drinking water. Iscream  took a sip of their orange juice and dug into their oatmeal with their favorite ingredient they brought from home, eye balls! Fwench Fwy was next to the window and had some French Toast sticks, with some milk but they looked at Chikn. he was just staring at his food, but Fwench Fwy knew he had to be hungry. he spent an entire day as a demigod, he had to be hungry.

Fwench Fwy: hey, buddy? you should start eating before it gets cold.

Chikn: huh? oh, I-I'm not hungry....

Chee swallowed her greek yogurt.

Chee: what? Chikn you had nothing to eat yesterday, and I can hear your stomach growl.

Chikn: Okay, maybe I am hungry, I just... don't feel hungry?

Iscream snorted at that, causing the wish dragon to elbow them in the ribs.

Fwench Fwy: at least eat your bacon, you love bacon.

Chikn pushed his plate away.

Chikn: no....

Fwench Fwy: Chikn, I know what's best for you, if it weren't for me you'd still be transforming this world!

Chikn: \*mumble\* you did nothing, liar...

Fwench Fwy: What did you say?

Chikn: Uh! I-I Mean...

Fwench Fwy: Chikn, I know what you are, you don't! you're lucky you didn't kill anyone or yourself! so just listen!

Chin: \*tears\* Ugh! You Never Listen!

He threw his plate on the ground, crawled under the table and stormed out. That's when Fwench Fwy realized people were staring at them and also realized they were in the wrong. they groaned and slid down in their seats as Iscream gently rubbed their partner's shoulder.

**\*OUTSIDE\***

Chikn was waiting by Fwench Fwy's car, tears stuck to his cheeks. The others made their way outside toward the puppy. Chee tried to look at her best friend but he avoided her gaze.

Fwench Fwy: can we.. talk?

Chikn began walking away.

Chikn: I think I've said enough, whatever I say, you take offense or just get mad.....

He tries walking away but Chee grabs his paw.

Chee: no, you have to stop running from us.

Chikn tried to get out of her grip but she was pretty strong.

Chee: stop struggling! we're trying to help! it's bad enough you refused to get a therapist-

Chikn: Because Only Crazy People Need Therapists! I May Be A Lot Of Things, Nut I'm Not Crazy! All I Ever Needed Was For You Guys To Forget Your Problems For A Second To Listen To The Hell I've Been Through! A-And You Can't Even Do That! So I'm Sorry I Got Mad Over That! I Know I'm Stupid And A Bad Dog! So Just Leave Me Alone!

Chee was taken aback by his words, but she let him go and he sprinted away. The gang was in silence until Sody spoke up.

Iscream: Is anyone gonna tell him home's 8 miles away?

Fwench Fwy elbowed them again.

**\*AT CHIKN'S HOUSE\***

Chikn was panting by the time he made it home. He was so tired, once he closed the door he collapsed onto the floor. He managed to pull himself up and drag himself up the stairs and into his bedroom. Once he got there he noticed a picture he always kept on his nightstand, which was a picture of him and his friends at the beach last year, all smiles and laughing. he kneels onto the ground as tears rolled down his face. he whispered one thing

Where they got angry for Blizzard completely pulling out of China servers and decided to publicly film the destruction of their studio and to even reward vandals with green tea from their own coffee business. That bit of news left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel like this company not only was unprofessional, but assumed themselves to be authority. Big red flags.

Now all of the sudden Bungie has them making a gacha game for them... and Disney along with others are letting them use their properties for Marvel Rivals... like why? Why on Earth would you trust this company out of all companies to make stuff for you? I don't get it and it creeps me out. 

I don't think Netease is friendly with Hoyoverse either which is even weirder to me. I find it hillarious that they tried to threaten Hoyoverse with copyrights on characters, when literally every idea from Netease is from somebody else. Their game attacks are taken from League and Overwatch, their characters are from Marvel. Literally these guys are part of a dying era where Chinese games used to copy everything and sucked. Companies like Hoyoverse should be entrusted with the future instead, not some pirates that'll destroy your property just for running away.

My (40F) fiance (40m) is an immigrant and has a very small close family and friends. I come from a very large family and am quite the social butterfly. 

My fiance does not want a big wedding because he feels it will be 100 people for me and 3 people for him, which I understand. But my family and friends are important to me and I love throwing a party- this party needs to be super special. (Neither of us have been married before).

This is my suggestion: ceremony In a church with a brunch reception. Meaning inviting all the friends, kids, aunts, uncles, cousins and coworkers to the ceremony then renting a room at the same church to do donuts, breakfast sandwiches, mimosas and coffee. Casual. 

Then that night, I throw a dinner party for 20- us, parents, siblings and wedding party. Black tie. Dancing. Intimate and beautiful. 

Is this rude? How long should we stay at the church with the refreshments to say hello to everyone and not be impolite? Is a short ceremony, a donut and a mimosa a chill morning wedding or is it weird?

   I am a third year uni student, 20 years old male. Need some advice on how to break my current stimulant abuse cycle with regards to the below proposed modalities. I currently use daily about 10-15 6mg nicotine pouches, 200-800 mg of caffeine in the form of black coffee, 20-80mg dextroamphetamine, and .1-.5 grams of psilocybin shrooms. I have really only been using this stack the past 4 weeks for finals prep. My bodyweight is 235lbs at 25% bw. I am an athlete and have healthy and standardized hydration, electrolyte, diet, and sleep protocols. I recently got my vitals taken when prescribed 18mg concerta for mild ADHD. and my resting HR is 75\~, my BP is 130/80. I have no personal or family history of schizophrenia or cardiovascular related conditions. I am not super concerned about acute health but am aware I need to stop for the same of chronic health, as such I plan on dropping these stimulants when I go home over break.

  
I have three proposed methods of dropping said cycle of abuse.

First, I leave and physically destroy everything aside from coffee. I drop to maybe 1-2 cups (60-120) mg of caffeine. After I regain a stable homeostasis stim free I proceed to start my 18mg concerta meds in accordance with my psychiatrist.

  
Second, I leave and don't destroy everything. I physically separate myself from the stimulants, achieve homeostasis and follow protocol for 18mg in accordance with my psychiatrist. When I return I expect to not relapse given the limited academic need of early semester workload and instate a safer use protocol when finals occur in may of 25'.

  
Thirdly, I leave and bring it all with me and ween off of one substance a week. I would start with the dextroamphetamine, then nicotine, then stop the microdosing of psilocybin, then ween off the caffeine. Then follow above procedure in respects to my concerta scripts.

  
I stopped taking everything today and I felt like death. I was physically sick for a few hours before I indulged in a small dose of everything to keep myself from stagnating academically. I have two more days of finals before I can conclude my semester and am on scholarship so please understand that within the confines of safe use I am obliged to continue use/abuse in the short term. 

Each of the above weeing protocols have their own shortcomings. Specifically I worry about relapsing into a cycle of abuse but I truly do feel like it is a product of pressure rather than an indulgence of self pleasure. Specific to the third protocol I really feel like I will experience extreme withdrawal that will adversely impact my training as a national level athlete, which is really something I want to avoid. 

  
Please feel free to give some tough love if necessary. Sources on the matter for independent reading are also greatly appreciated.

Thanks for the lengthy read and feedback!

I'm a 20-year-old male studying chemistry abroad. When I started my semester in September, me and my ex were still together. I went abroad because it was my dream to study at this particular university, she went abroad because she hated her family and wanted to stay with me. We'd had issues even before the semester started; I found out that she had been saying some very unpleasant stuff behind my back, and she became quite controlling. When I confronted her about it this summer, she promised to change, and she at least tried.

  
When we moved abroad, the issues reappeared and got even worse. I won't type it out in detail but the relationship was starting to impact my well-being in a negative way and I decided to break up with her on the 5th of November. She cried and didn't want to accept it, but I'd made my mind before that and she didn't change my opinion. After we'd split up, I checked up on her several times. I told her to go home and spend time with her family and to find a psychologist and work with them to get over me. She promised to do both but actually didn't do anything, which I found out about later.

  
On 23rd of November, Saturday, she called me, said that she'd really like to talk to me. We were on call for about an hour. She asked me to return her some things of hers that I still had and forgot to return to her, and she told me that she'd like to cut contact. She lied to me that she was home with her parents and had a lot of support from them.

  
The next day, she ingested a lethal dose of a chemical and passed away. She didn't go home. Her parents didn't even know that we'd split up (and later blamed me for not telling them). She didn't see a mental health professional, she completely isolated herself, harmed herself physically, and then took her life. According to a text message she sent me at \~8 pm, approximately 20 minutes before she died, she'd been planning to do it for a long time. After I got the message, I immediately called the police and ambulance, threw up several times and stared into the ceiling with maybe one hour of sleep until I had to get up in the morning.

  
When she did this, I was in the middle of an intense lab course (10 hours of lab work a day for over a week with 2 tests each day). How I managed to pass it I have no fucking idea since I was functioning only on energy drinks, barely any sleep, adrenaline, and coffee. 

  
I obviously wanted information, I didn't know where she was, how she was, whether she was even alive. Since I'm not her immediate family, the police told me nothing, so I had to contact her parents. They told me that she'd died. They blamed me for her death, for not telling them that we split up, for not fucking I don't know noticing it. Even though they themselves didn't. They had no idea she'd been struggling mentally. Holy fuck I though I'd gotten rid of this rage but no I didn't, HOW DOES ONE NOT NOTICE THEIR OWN CHILD HAVING ISSUES FOR FUCKS SAKE??? THAT STARTED WHEN SHE WAS STILL HOME, LIVING WITH THEM? Anyway. The moment my labs ended and I got out of there, I broke down in the hallway. My classmates told me that they basically had to drag me to my dorm, but since they knew what happened, they weren't much surprised. When I got to my dorm, I drank several beers, a bottle of wine and some more beers all while calling different people. The next day, I skipped school and took a train home. I arrived after 7 hours of traveling.

  
I deleted my last post because there was a chance that I could get connected to her as someone who got the chemical for her since she shouldn't be able to buy it herself as a computer science student with no connection to any chemical facility. However, apparently, even though the sale is regulated on some sites that sell chemicals, a layperson can buy it from such sites as fucking Allegro. I'm not suspected for giving it to her, so I feel safe writing about this again.

  
When I returned home, I stayed there for almost a week. I hung out with several groups of friends who knew her. We grieved, cursed the world, ourselves, and her, but it helped us all I think. Right now, I'm functional, at least during the day. I have so much coursework that I pretty much have to be. However, when I'm alone in the evening or at night, I feel horrible. I cry. I drink copious amounts of alcohol, which I'm worried about. Also, my metabolism is all messed up. Sometimes, I eat like a regular human, but sometimes, I don't eat anything for a whole day. My sleep schedule is similar. I'm working with a psychologist and I constantly call different people, mostly my very good friends from high school, who try to help me. My only beacon of hope is that in a week, I'll go home finally and I'll have some time to rest finally. 

  
I didn't attend her funeral, even though I was invited to it. It wasn't public. In fact, I'd have been the only attendee not directly related to her and I didn't feel safe going there under such conditions. I was called heartless for it but I don't even care anymore. Her parents wanted to return me some gifts I gave her, like this big soft plushie and books worth several 100s€, but I refused. I'm not sure if it was a good idea. I'm not sure about anything anymore. Tomorrow, I have a big organic chemistry exam that I have to pass with a decent grade. I studied some, but I'm not sure how it'll go. We'll see. This weekend, one amazing friend of mine will be in the city and I'd like to go out with her, get a coffee, talk some about what's happened. We'll see if it works out.

  
Tonight, she talked to me in my dream. She wanted to tell me that she loved me. That she still does. That she forgives me for ending things. She says she isn't happy and never will, but she doesn't suffer anymore. She apologized for doing what she did and tried to explain herself, but couldn't. She asked me to give her the last orgasm of her life. Or. Well. Not life but you get it. I was actually kinda happy after I woke up, which is a nice change. I'm not religious, but I'm not an atheist either, I just don't think that any religion on earth has the chance of explaining God if such an entity exists. I hope she knows now and that it was this entity showing me her last emotions before death. I hope it was more than a dream and I've decided to believe that.

  
I'm not sure if this post has any value. I only know that my life and the lives of my family and friends do have a lot of value. And I'm willing to do anything if it means my friends whom I love very much are okay in this difficult time, and they are willing to do the same for me",4,1733953230.0,offmychest,0,0.83,False

1hc4ukb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/1hc4ukb/what_i_learned_from_selling_at_my_first_book_fair/,What I Learned From Selling At My First Book Fair,"I finally plucked up the courage to put on my extrovert hat and venture forth to **The Oxford Indie Book Fair** (in the UK) to show off my book for the first time in person. I learned a lot from my adventure and thought others might find it helpful.

**1 - Bring Obvious Bits**

It’s worth making a checklist of all the obvious things to bring because you’re bound to forget something! Stuff like pens for signing, paper for notes, portable charger, snacks, tablecloth, and book stands are all easy to overlook. 

The plastic bookstands I bought were cheap and portable. Stacked on top of a pile of books, they added dynamic height without carrying a big shelf. Critical if you are car-less!

Bookmarks were also a must. I had some whipped up on Vistaprint pretty cheaply, and they even have a designing tool you can use. Bookmarks are a great way to connect with people on the fence about buying. However, I should have put on a discreet QR code with a unique redirect to track the success rate.

**2 - The Right Stock**

I brought waaaay too many books. A little optimistic on my part, and sadly, it broke the wheels on the suitcase! I sold 20 books, which I think was above average (I heard of other authors selling around 5 books). My sequel sold the least at only three copies. So, the first book in a series will likely sell at least four times as much as any sequel.

**3 - Helpers Are Helpful**

Luckily for me, my lovely partner came with me, and she was the perfect assistant! Running off to get me lunch and coffee, leaving me to sell sell sell. It’s also nice to have moral support and someone to help with carrying. Plus, I could go to the loo without worrying that I was abandoning ship.

**4 - Finding Your Audience**

As a fantasy author, I could spot the demographics that would be most interested. Basically, the fun nerds! The people at that kind of book fair were generally less interested in fantasy, so perhaps I would do better at comic conventions. However, I did have a trick to find the right crowd…

**5 - Lure Them In**

I had a fabulous gimmick to attract customers: if they could roll a 20 on a 20-sided die, they would win a free book. This was a BIG hit. It gave people a reason to stop, and then I could do my sales pitch. It also attracted people who like fantasy, who would immediately recognise the iconic ‘D20’. One person ran over after simply HEARING the die roll from afar. It added excitement to every encounter. It attracted the right crowd for my fantasy comedy book.

There were almost 200 rolls, and I had 7 people win a book (maths will tell you I beat the odds). It was interesting to see people’s reactions, too. Some people were clearly in the market for a freebie and were indifferent to me. Fortunately, they didn’t win. 

Each book costs me around £4 to print, but I think £28 was well worth it to attract 200 people! The people who did win may go on to leave reviews or buy the sequel.

I advise anyone looking to sell at a book fair or similar: have a lure. It should be fun and free. Bowls of sweets were popular, but I don’t think they helped. Try to think of a game or prize you can play that matches your genre. Like *“Spot the Murderer in 10 Seconds”* if you are in mystery, or *“How Many Hershey Kisses Are in the Jar”* if you are in romance.

Next time, however, I’ll bring disinfectant for the much-handled die.

**6 - Gather Data**

Counting the rolls was a good way to track my direct interactions. Bookmarks were a good marker (pun intended) of ‘maybes’. I gave them to people who I spoke to who seemed interested but didn’t want to buy the book then and there. There’s a very good chance they won’t, but you never know. 

I gave away 69 bookmarks, and 196 people rolled the dice, with 20 sales, which amounts to around a 10% success rate. We can imagine the bookmark takers are hard ‘maybe’s’, so that’s a 35% connection rate. The organisers said there were around 1500 visitors who attended the event. Therefore, I managed to sell to just over 1% of the visitors.

I don’t know how all this compares to other events and authors, but it’s a good future reference point! Would love to hear about other peoples statistics.

**7 - Location, Location, Location**

My table was right by the entrance - but I don’t know if that was good or not. You would think that you could catch more people's attention, but people often used the excuse that they had “only just arrived” and wanted to shop around rather than buy my book. I wonder if a different placement would change that. Perhaps people at the other end of the hall would be the last seen, and therefore, the customer's decision would be clearer by then? I would need to experiment to really know! 

**8 - Don’t Miss Networking**

I probably could have networked more with other authors. It is such a great opportunity to see what other people are doing and make connections. However, my dice game kept a constant stream of people coming, so I barely had a moment once the doors opened! The next time, I’ll probably feel more “at home” and will take a moment to speak with the other authors before the event starts.

**9 - Have Proper Signage**

The other author’s big banners looked really cool, so I may try to get one made for my next book fair. I just had a framed poster on an easel. Many people stopped to pick up my book and read the blurb, which was a little awkward to watch them read all 250 words. I think having a sign/banner with an abbreviated blurb for people to read from afar would be well worth it.

**10 - Take All Payments**

I thought needed a sign with the prices and payment types. However, people would still ask about the prices and if I took cash or card. Many simply expected me to take card payments. Luckily, I used the Zelle app on my phone, and it worked great. After an hour, I took down the price sign, which didn’t change anything. One less sign to worry about! It also meant I could reduce prices and make cheeky deals as appropriate.

Furthermore, the younger crowd was often interested in the book but didn’t want to spend money. Poor students can barely afford the heating bills, after all! I think next time, I will offer a sizable student discount. A sale is a sale!

So I tell OneDrive unsync the shortcut and then OneDrive stops because there are sync issues with that Shortcut...but I can't see the full path and there are no error indicators on where this issue is with the shortcut.  At this point I should add that when shortcuts have sync issues, it does not give you an option to resolve them, or even see the full path; you just have to trace it via the red X's.  Problem is, because I'm trying to unsync this Shortcut, there are no Red X's.  Okay, confirm with the user all their data is on the Sharepoint and we're good to delete the Shortcut, so I close OneDrive and nuke the shortcut, open OneDrive and everything is happy right?  Wrong.  Because now, OneDrive won't let me sync the Sharepoint back to OneDrive...because it says there's a shortcut present for that Sharepoint.  Check the online view of OneDrive...no shortcuts at all (as I banished them to hell where they belong), check the user's folders, no shortcuts.  Try a reset of OneDrive...nope, same error!  The phantom shortcut cannot be banished despite there being no trace of it online or on the PC.

The only solution was to unlink the user's account from the PC completely, then sign back in, then manually begin to resync all five of the user's Sharepoints.

# Introduction

Money. It's a topic that can make people feel excited, anxious, or even uncomfortable. But here's the thing - your relationship with money plays a huge role in how successful you'll be, both in business and in life.

Think about it. How you view money, how you feel about it, and what you believe about wealth can either push you forward or hold you back. It's not just about how much cash you have in the bank. It's about your whole approach to finances and success.

In this article, we're going to dive into something called your ""money mindset."" We'll look at how the way you think about money connects to your personal growth and how well your business does. Whether you're an entrepreneur, an employee, or just someone who wants to get better with money, understanding and shaping your money mindset can be a game-changer.

So, let's roll up our sleeves and explore how you can shift your thinking to set yourself up for financial success. We'll cover everything from spotting negative beliefs about money to setting clear goals and embracing an abundance mindset. By the end, you'll have practical tools to reshape your relationship with money and open up new possibilities for wealth and success.

# Understanding Money Mindset

# What is a Money Mindset?

Let's start with the basics. Your money mindset is basically how you think and feel about money. It's the set of beliefs and attitudes you have about finances, wealth, and success. These beliefs shape how you handle money, make financial decisions, and approach opportunities to earn or grow your wealth.

Think of your money mindset as the lens through which you view all things money-related. It affects everything from how you budget and save to how you invest and spend. It even influences bigger life choices, like the career path you choose or whether you decide to start a business.

# Where Do Our Money Beliefs Come From?

Our beliefs about money don't just appear out of thin air. They're shaped by a bunch of different factors:

1. Family influences: The way your parents or guardians talked about and handled money probably had a big impact on you. Maybe they were always stressed about bills, or perhaps they taught you to save every penny. These early experiences stick with us. 
2. Cultural background: Different cultures have different attitudes towards wealth, spending, and financial success. These cultural norms seep into our own beliefs, often without us even realizing it. 
3. Personal experiences: That time you lost money on a bad investment? Or when you landed your first big client? These experiences shape how you view financial risks and opportunities. 
4. Media and society: The messages we get from TV, social media, and society in general play a role too. Think about how wealth is portrayed in movies or on Instagram - it all contributes to our overall perception of money. 
5. Education: What we learn (or don't learn) about personal finance in school or from mentors can significantly influence our money mindset. 

# Common Money Attitudes

People tend to fall into different categories when it comes to their attitudes towards money. Here are a few common ones:

* The Saver: Always focused on putting money aside, sometimes to the point of missing out on experiences or opportunities.
* The Spender: Lives for the moment, often struggling to save or plan for the future.
* The Avoider: Prefers not to think about money at all, which can lead to financial problems.
* The Worrier: Constantly stressed about money, regardless of their actual financial situation.
* The Risk-Taker: Sees money as a tool for potential gain, often willing to take big financial risks.
* The Giver: Finds joy in using money to help others, sometimes at the expense of their own financial health.

Which one sounds most like you? Or maybe you're a mix of a few? Understanding your current attitude is the first step in reshaping your money mindset.

# The Impact on Your Life and Business

Your money mindset doesn't just affect your bank account. It ripples out into all areas of your life and business:

* Career choices: Your beliefs about money might push you towards a ""safe"" job or inspire you to take the leap into entrepreneurship.
* Business decisions: As a business owner, your money mindset influences everything from pricing your products to how you handle growth opportunities.
* Relationships: Money is often a source of conflict in relationships. Your money mindset plays a big role in how you navigate these discussions.
* Stress levels: A negative money mindset can lead to constant worry and stress, impacting your overall well-being.
* Life satisfaction: Feeling confident and positive about your finances can boost your overall happiness and life satisfaction.

The good news? While your money mindset has a big impact, it's not set in stone. With awareness and effort, you can shift your mindset to one that supports your financial goals and overall success. And that's exactly what we're going to explore next.

# Identifying Limiting Beliefs

Before we can reshape our money mindset, we need to know what we're dealing with. This means taking a good, honest look at our current beliefs about money - especially the ones that might be holding us back. These are what we call ""limiting beliefs.""

# What Are Limiting Beliefs?

Limiting beliefs are thoughts or attitudes that hold you back from achieving your full potential. When it comes to money, these beliefs can keep you stuck in a financial rut or prevent you from pursuing opportunities for growth and wealth.

The tricky thing about limiting beliefs is that we often don't even realize we have them. They operate in the background of our minds, influencing our decisions and actions without us being fully aware.

# Common Money Limiting Beliefs

Let's look at some limiting beliefs that many people have about money. As you read through these, think about whether any of them sound familiar to you:

1. ""Money is the root of all evil."" This classic saying can make people feel guilty about wanting to earn more or build wealth. 
2. ""Rich people are greedy/dishonest/unhappy."" These stereotypes can make you subconsciously resist becoming wealthy yourself. 
3. ""I'm not good with money."" This belief can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading you to avoid learning about or taking control of your finances. 
4. ""I'll never be rich."" This mindset can stop you from even trying to improve your financial situation. 
5. ""Money doesn't grow on trees."" While technically true, this saying can reinforce a scarcity mindset and limit your ability to see opportunities for earning. 
6. ""I don't deserve to be wealthy."" This belief often stems from low self-esteem and can hold you back from financial success. 
7. ""Making money has to be hard work."" This can prevent you from seeking out or recognizing easier or more enjoyable ways to earn. 
8. ""I need to choose between doing what I love and making money."" This false dichotomy can keep you stuck in unfulfilling work or prevent you from monetizing your passions. 

# How to Spot Your Own Limiting Beliefs

Identifying your own limiting beliefs takes some self-reflection. Here are a few techniques you can use:

1. Pay attention to your self-talk: Notice the things you say to yourself about money. Are they mostly positive or negative? 
2. Look at your actions: Sometimes our behaviors reveal beliefs we're not consciously aware of. For example, if you always avoid looking at your bank balance, it might indicate a belief that money management is scary or overwhelming. 
3. Examine your financial history: Look for patterns in your past financial decisions. Do you see any recurring themes that might point to underlying beliefs? 
4. Try journaling: Write about your feelings and thoughts about money. Often, putting things on paper can help you spot patterns and beliefs you hadn't noticed before. 
5. Consider your family history: Think about the messages you received about money growing up. How might these have shaped your current beliefs? 
6. Notice your emotional reactions: Pay attention to how you feel when you think about money, wealth, or financial decisions. Strong emotional reactions can be clues to underlying beliefs. 

# The Impact of Limiting Beliefs

Limiting beliefs about money can have a real, tangible impact on your life and business. They can:

* Stop you from asking for a raise or increasing your prices
* Prevent you from investing or saving for the future
* Keep you stuck in a job or business model that's not serving you
* Lead to self-sabotage when you start to achieve financial success
* Create unnecessary stress and anxiety around money matters

The good news is that once you've identified your limiting beliefs, you've taken the first step towards changing them. In the next section, we'll look at how you can start to shift these beliefs and develop a more positive, empowering money mindset.

# Shifting Your Mindset

Now that we've identified some common limiting beliefs, it's time to roll up our sleeves and start shifting that mindset. Remember, this isn't about forcing yourself to think positively all the time. It's about challenging those old beliefs and replacing them with ones that serve you better.

# Reframing Negative Beliefs

Reframing is a powerful technique for shifting your mindset. It's all about looking at your beliefs from a different angle. Here's how you can reframe some common limiting beliefs:

1. ""Money is the root of all evil"" → ""Money is a tool that can be used for good or bad"" This reframe acknowledges that money itself is neutral. It's how we use it that matters. 
2. ""Rich people are greedy"" → ""Wealth allows people to have a bigger positive impact"" This shift focuses on the potential good that can come from having resources. 
3. ""I'm not good with money"" → ""I'm learning to manage money better every day"" This reframe turns a fixed mindset into a growth mindset, emphasizing progress over perfection. 
4. ""I'll never be rich"" → ""I'm working towards financial abundance"" This shift moves from a defeatist attitude to one of active progress and possibility. 
5. ""Money doesn't grow on trees"" → ""There are many opportunities to earn money"" This reframe opens your mind to the abundance of earning possibilities around you. 

# Positive Self-Talk and Affirmations

Positive self-talk and affirmations can help reinforce your new beliefs. Here are some examples:

* ""I am worthy of financial success""
* ""I make smart decisions with my money""
* ""Money flows easily into my life""
* ""I use my wealth to create positive change""
* ""I am constantly learning and improving my financial skills""

The key with affirmations is consistency. Try saying them to yourself daily, perhaps as part of your morning routine. It might feel a bit silly at first, but stick with it. Over time, these new thoughts can start to replace the old, limiting ones.

# Visualization Techniques

Visualization is a powerful tool for reshaping your mindset. Here's a simple visualization exercise you can try:

1. Find a quiet place where you won't be disturbed.
2. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths to relax.
3. Imagine yourself achieving your financial goals. What does it look like? How does it feel?
4. Be as detailed as possible. See yourself confidently managing your money, making wise investments, or running a successful business.
5. Really feel the emotions associated with this success - the pride, the security, the excitement.
6. Open your eyes and carry that feeling with you throughout your day.

Regular visualization can help train your brain to see financial success as a real possibility for you.

# Surrounding Yourself with Positive Influences

The people and information we surround ourselves with have a big impact on our mindset. Here are some ways to create a more positive money environment:

1. Seek out financially savvy friends or mentors. Their attitudes can rub off on you.
2. Read books or listen to podcasts about personal finance and wealth creation.
3. Follow social media accounts that share positive, educational content about money.
4. Consider joining a mastermind group focused on financial growth.

Remember, shifting your mindset is a process. It won't happen overnight, but with consistent effort, you can replace those old limiting beliefs with new, empowering ones. In the next section, we'll look at how cultivating gratitude can further boost your money mindset.

# Cultivating Gratitude

You might be wondering, ""What does gratitude have to do with money?"" Well, it turns out, quite a lot! Cultivating a sense of gratitude can have a powerful impact on your money mindset and, in turn, your financial success.

# The Power of Gratitude in Your Money Mindset

Gratitude does a few important things for your money mindset:

1. It shifts your focus from what you lack to what you have. This can help combat feelings of scarcity or ""never having enough."" 
2. It can reduce stress and anxiety around money. When you're grateful for what you have, you're less likely to worry constantly about what you don't have. 
3. It can increase your sense of abundance. Regularly noting the good things in your life can make you feel ""richer"" in a broader sense. 
4. It can improve your overall well-being, which can indirectly benefit your finances by boosting your productivity and decision-making skills. 

# Practical Ways to Practice Gratitude

Incorporating gratitude into your daily life doesn't have to be complicated. Here are some simple practices you can try:

1. Gratitude journaling: Each day, write down 3-5 things you're grateful for. They don't all have to be money-related, but try to include at least one financial blessing each day, no matter how small. 
2. The ""money gratitude"" moment: Every time you make a purchase or pay a bill, take a second to be grateful. For example, ""I'm grateful I can afford this coffee"" or ""I'm thankful I have electricity in my home."" 
3. Gratitude walk: Take a short walk and notice all the things around you that you're grateful for. This can include material possessions, but also experiences, relationships, and opportunities. 
4. Gratitude jar: Write down things you're grateful for on small pieces of paper and put them in a jar. When you're feeling down about your finances, pull out a few and read them. 
5. Saying ""thank you"": Make it a habit to genuinely thank people who provide you with goods or services. This includes everyone from your barista to your financial advisor. 

# Gratitude in Business

If you're a business owner or entrepreneur, bringing gratitude into your work can have additional benefits:

1. Be grateful for your customers or clients. This can improve your service and potentially lead to more business. 
2. Appreciate your team or employees. Gratitude can boost morale and productivity. 
3. Be thankful for challenges. They're opportunities for growth and learning. 
4. Appreciate your journey. Every step, even the missteps, has brought you to where you are today. 

# Examples of How Gratitude Can Shift Financial Perceptions

Let's look at a few examples of how gratitude can change your perspective on financial situations:

1. Instead of: ""I hate paying taxes."" Try: ""I'm grateful to live in a country with public services and infrastructure."" 
2. Instead of: ""I can't afford to go on vacation this year."" Try: ""I'm grateful for the local attractions I can enjoy on day trips."" 
3. Instead of: ""I'm stressed about this big expense coming up."" Try: ""I'm thankful I have the means to handle this expense, even if it's tight."" 
4. Instead of: ""I wish I earned more."" Try: ""I'm grateful for the income I have and the opportunities to increase it."" 

Remember, practicing gratitude doesn't mean ignoring financial challenges or pretending everything is perfect. It's about finding balance and perspective. You can acknowledge difficulties while still appreciating what you have.

By regularly practicing gratitude, you're training your brain to notice the positive aspects of your financial life. This can lead to a more optimistic money mindset, which in turn can open you up to more opportunities and better financial decision-making.

In the next section, we'll look at how to set clear financial goals, which is another key component of a healthy money mindset.

# Setting Clear Financial Goals

Having a positive money mindset is great, but to really make progress, you need to know where you're going. That's where setting clear financial goals comes in. Goals give you direction and motivation, and they're a crucial part of shaping a healthy money mindset.

# Why Goal-Setting Matters

Setting financial goals is important for several reasons:

1. It gives you focus: Instead of vaguely wanting to ""be better with money,"" you have specific targets to aim for. 
2. It motivates you: Clear goals can inspire you to take action and make changes in your financial habits. 
3. It helps you measure progress: With defined goals, you can see how far you've come and celebrate your wins along the way. 
4. It aids decision-making: When you have clear goals, it's easier to decide whether a purchase or investment aligns with your financial priorities. 

# How to Set Effective Financial Goals

Not all goals are created equal. Here's how to set goals that will actually help you move forward:

1. Be specific: Instead of ""save more money,"" try ""save $5,000 for an emergency fund."" 
2. Make them measurable: You should be able to clearly tell when you've achieved your goal. 
3. Set a timeframe: Give yourself a deadline. This adds urgency and helps you stay on track. 
4. Make them realistic: While it's good to challenge yourself, setting impossible goals will only lead to frustration. 
5. Ensure they're relevant: Your goals should align with your values and long-term vision for your life. 

# Examples of Financial Goals

Here are some examples of well-defined financial goals:

* Short-term: ""Pay off $2,000 of credit card debt in the next 6 months""
* Medium-term: ""Save $10,000 for a house down payment in the next 2 years""
* Long-term: ""Invest consistently to have $500,000 in my retirement account by age 60""

Remember, your goals should be personal to you. What matters is that they reflect what you truly want to achieve financially.

# Tracking Your Progress

Setting goals is just the first step. To keep your motivation high and your mindset positive, you need to track your progress. Here are some ways to do that:

1. Use a budgeting app: Many apps allow you to set savings goals and track your progress visually. 
2. Create a goal tracker: This could be a simple spreadsheet or even a colorful chart on your wall. 
3. Schedule regular check-ins: Set a monthly or quarterly ""money date"" with yourself to review your progress. 
4. Celebrate milestones: When you hit a goal or even make significant progress, take time to acknowledge and celebrate it. 

# Adjusting Your Goals

Life changes, and your goals might need to change too. Maybe you get a promotion and can save more, or perhaps an unexpected expense means you need to adjust your timeline. That's okay! Regularly review your goals and be willing to adjust them as needed.

# The Mindset Shift

As you set and work towards your financial goals, you might notice a shift in your mindset. You may feel more in control of your finances, more confident in your ability to manage money, and more optimistic about your financial future.

This is the power of goal-setting in action. It's not just about reaching the end goal (though that's great too!). It's about the person you become in the process - someone who takes charge of their financial life and believes in their ability to create the future they want.

In the next section, we'll explore another crucial aspect of a wealth-building mindset: embracing abundance.

# Embracing Abundance

We've talked about shifting your mindset and setting goals. Now let's dive into a concept that can really supercharge your financial mindset: embracing abundance. This is about moving from a ""scarcity"" mindset to an ""abundance"" mindset.

# Scarcity vs. Abundance Mindset

First, let's break down what these terms mean:

Scarcity Mindset:

* Believes there's never enough to go around
* Focuses on lack and limitation
* Views success as a finite resource
* Often leads to hoarding and fear-based decisions

Abundance Mindset:

* Believes there are plenty of opportunities and resources
* Focuses on possibilities and potential
* Views success as unlimited and available to all
* Often leads to generosity and growth-oriented decisions

# Shifting to an Abundance Mindset

Moving from scarcity to abundance thinking isn't always easy, but it's definitely worth it. Here are some ways to start making the shift:

1. Notice scarcity thoughts: Start by becoming aware of when you're thinking in terms of scarcity. Phrases like ""I can't afford that"" or ""There's not enough time"" are clues. 
2. Question your assumptions: When you notice a scarcity thought, ask yourself if it's really true. Is there really not enough, or are you just assuming that? 
3. Look for evidence of abundance: Start noticing all the ways in which you already have enough. This could be material things, but also skills, relationships, or opportunities. 
4. Practice generosity: It might seem counterintuitive, but giving can actually make you feel more abundant. This doesn't always have to be money - you can be generous with your time, knowledge, or skills too. 
5. Focus on creating value: Instead of worrying about getting your ""piece of the pie,"" focus on how you can create more value in the world. This often leads to more opportunities and resources coming your way. 
6. Celebrate others' successes: Instead of feeling threatened when others do well, genuinely celebrate with them. This reinforces the belief that there's enough success to go around. 

# The Benefits of an Abundance Mindset in Business

An abundance mindset can be particularly powerful in business. Here's how:

1. Innovation: When you believe in abundance, you're more likely to see new opportunities and come up with creative solutions. 
2. Collaboration: An abundance mindset makes it easier to collaborate with others, even potential competitors, leading to win-win outcomes. 
3. Risk-taking: When you believe there are always more opportunities, you're more willing to take calculated risks. 
4. Customer focus: An abundance mindset helps you focus on creating value for customers, rather than just trying to get money from them. 
5. Resilience: When setbacks happen, an abundance mindset helps you see them as temporary and believe in your ability to bounce back. 

# Abundance in Practice

Let's look at some practical ways to apply an abundance mindset to your finances:

1. Instead of thinking ""I can't afford that,"" ask ""How can I afford that?"" This opens up your mind to creative solutions. 
2. Look for ways to increase your income rather than just cutting expenses. This could mean starting a side hustle, asking for a raise, or finding new markets for your business. 
3. Invest in yourself and your skills. An abundance mindset recognizes that learning and growth lead to more opportunities. 
4. Network and build relationships without an agenda. You never know what opportunities might arise from genuine connections. 
5. When faced with a setback, look for the lesson or opportunity within it. There's often a silver lining if you're open to seeing it. 

# A Word of Caution

Embracing abundance doesn't mean being unrealistic or irresponsible with your finances. It's not about ignoring real financial constraints or taking unnecessary risks. Instead, it's about approaching your financial life with optimism, creativity, and a belief in possibilities.

Remember, shifting to an abundance mindset is a process. You might still have scarcity thoughts pop up from time to time, and that's okay. The key is to notice them, challenge them, and gradually train your brain to default to abundance thinking.

As you embrace an abundance mindset, you'll likely find that you feel more positive about your financial journey. You'll be more open to opportunities, more resilient in the face of challenges, and more confident in your ability to create the financial future you want.

In our next and final section, we'll talk about the importance of continuous learning and growth in maintaining a positive money mindset.

# Continuous Learning and Growth

We've covered a lot of ground in reshaping your money mindset. But here's the thing: it's not a one-and-done deal. To really succeed financially, you need to commit to continuous learning and growth. The world of finance is always changing, and so are your own financial needs and goals. Staying curious and open to learning is key to long-term success.

# The Importance of Financial Literacy

Financial literacy is simply the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing. Here's why it's so crucial:

1. Better decision-making: The more you understand about finance, the better equipped you are to make smart money decisions. 
2. Reduced stress: Knowledge is power. Understanding your finances can help reduce money-related anxiety. 
3. More opportunities: Financial literacy opens your eyes to opportunities you might otherwise miss, like smart investments or tax-saving strategies. 
4. Increased confidence: As your financial knowledge grows, so does your confidence in handling money matters. 
5. Long-term security: Financial literacy helps you plan better for the future, including retirement and unexpected expenses. 

# Resources for Improving Financial Knowledge

The good news is, there are tons of resources out there to help you boost your financial know-how. Here are some to consider:

1. Books: There are countless great books on personal finance and investing. Some popular ones include ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" by Robert Kiyosaki, ""The Total Money Makeover"" by Dave Ramsey, and ""Your Money or Your Life"" by Vicki Robin. 
2. Podcasts: Financial podcasts are a great way to learn on the go. Try ""The Dave Ramsey Show,"" ""So Money with Farnoosh Torabi,"" or ""BiggerPockets Money."" 
3. Online courses: Platforms like Coursera, edX, and Udemy offer courses on everything from basic budgeting to advanced investing strategies. 
4. Blogs and websites: Follow reputable financial blogs and websites for regular tips and insights. Some popular ones include NerdWallet, The Balance, and Mr. Money Mustache. 
5. Financial advisors: Consider working with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice and help you learn along the way. 
6. Community education: Many local libraries, community centers, and banks offer free financial literacy workshops. 

# Developing a Habit of Lifelong Learning

Learning about money shouldn't feel like a chore. Here are some ways to make it a natural part of your life:

1. Set learning goals: Just like you set financial goals, set learning goals. Maybe it's reading one finance book per month or taking an online course each quarter. 
2. Make it routine: Dedicate a specific time each week to financial learning. Even 30 minutes can make a big difference over time. 
3. Apply what you learn: Knowledge is most valuable when put into practice. Try to apply something new you've learned each month. 
4. Teach others: One of the best ways to reinforce your own learning is to share it with others. This could be as simple as explaining a financial concept to a friend. 
5. Stay current: The financial world is always evolving. Make a habit of staying up-to-date with financial news and trends. 
6. Learn from your experiences: Reflect on your financial decisions, both good and bad. What can you learn from them? 

# The Growth Mindset in Finance

Adopting a growth mindset is crucial in your financial journey. This means believing that you can improve your financial skills and situation through effort and learning. Here's how to apply a growth mindset to your finances:

1. Embrace challenges: See financial challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, not as failures. 
2. Learn from criticism: If someone points out a flaw in your financial strategy, thank them and consider how you can improve. 
3. Find lessons in others' success: Instead of feeling envious of others' financial success, ask yourself what you can learn from them. 
4. Value the process: Focus on the progress you're making in your financial journey, not just the end results. 
5. Cultivate resilience: View setbacks as temporary and focus on how you can bounce back stronger. 

# The Ongoing Journey

Remember, reshaping your money mindset and improving your financial literacy is an ongoing journey. There will always be more to learn, new skills to develop, and fresh challenges to overcome. But that's what makes it exciting!

As you continue to learn and grow, you'll likely find that your confidence increases, your financial decisions improve, and your overall relationship with money becomes healthier. You'll be better equipped to handle whatever financial situations come your way, and more empowered to create the financial future you want.

# Conclusion

We've covered a lot of ground in our exploration of how to shape your mindset for wealth in business and life. Let's recap the key points:

1. Your money mindset - the set of beliefs and attitudes you have about finances - plays a crucial role in your financial success. 
2. Identifying and challenging limiting beliefs about money is the first step in reshaping your mindset. 
3. Techniques like reframing, positive self-talk, and visualization can help you shift to a more positive money mindset. 
4. Cultivating gratitude can boost your sense of abundance and improve your overall relationship with money. 
5. Setting clear, specific financial goals gives you direction and motivation in your financial journey. 
6. Embracing an abundance mindset opens you up to more opportunities and fosters a more positive approach to finances. 
7. Committing to continuous learning and growth is key to long-term financial success. 

Remember, changing your money mindset isn't an overnight process. It takes time, effort, and consistency. But the payoff can be huge - not just in terms of your bank balance, but in your overall quality of life.

Here are some actionable steps you can take to start reshaping your money mindset today:

1. Spend some time reflecting on your current beliefs about money. Write them down and challenge any that seem limiting. 
2. Start a daily gratitude practice, making sure to include things related to your finances. 
3. Set one short-term and one long-term financial goal. Make them specific, measurable, and timebound. 
4. Choose one resource (a book, podcast, or course) to expand your financial knowledge and commit to engaging with it regularly. 
5. Practice reframing negative money thoughts into more positive, abundance-focused ones. 

Remember, the goal isn't to never worry about money or to pretend that financial challenges don't exist. It's about approaching your finances with a more positive, proactive, and empowered mindset. It's about seeing money as a tool to create the life you want, rather than a source of stress or limitation.

As you continue on this journey, be patient with yourself. Celebrate your progress, learn from setbacks, and keep pushing forward. Your mindset is one of the most powerful tools you have in creating wealth and success in both business and life. By consciously shaping it, you're setting yourself up for a brighter, more abundant financial future.

Here's to your financial success and the exciting journey ahead!

My son is 17 and has autism. Honestly, it didn't make too much of an (apparent) impact on him emotionally until he was at the tail end of middle school. He has had an IEP since Kindergarten so he has always had accommodations at school. He's high functioning and incredibly smart, but he hates himself so much. 

He started becoming depressed in middle school, and during his freshman year, we had him put on antidepressants. However, all they succeeded in doing was making him rageful; prior to that, he was morose, but never outwardly angry. Once on the meds, though, he was lashing out; calling his brother slurs, being rude to his teachers... once, it got so bad once that they had to put him in alternative school for a bit for assaulting another student. Pleading with that kid's mom to not press charges was fun. Once we got him off of the meds, the rage subsided, so for obvious reasons, he's hesitant to get on them again. 

We've tried therapy, but he doesn't participate. He complains that therapists don't know what they're doing or that they just can't help him, but he won't put in the work. He says he wants to learn how to be more ""normal"" socially, so I found an online course for teens with autism that teaches just that - he didn't want to participate. I was like, dude this is literally exactly the help that you asked for, and you still won't take it. 

I thought we were back on track. He's been pouring himself into school, tons of AP classes and has been doing great, at least I thought.

Yesterday, I found out that he was drinking; he was milling around the house, drunk as fuck, talking about how weird and r-word he is, recalling how he used to smear shit on the walls when he was a toddler ad how that's not normal, how he has no friends, etc. I tried talking with him then but we were getting nowhere, so I gave him some coffee and told him we'd talk today when he was sober. 

Obviously, I am dumping the liquor. But I don't know what else to do. How do you help someone who refuses to be helped? I know much of this is not in his control, but I'm just grasping at straws here. It breaks my heart to see him like this but I just don't know how to help him. Not sure if this is a rant or a request for hep, but if you've been in these shoes and you have advice, I'll fuckin' take it all.

1hc4pt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1hc4pt9/d_color_diamonds_expert_tips_and_complete_value/,D Color Diamonds: Expert Tips and Complete Value Analysis,"D color diamonds represent absolute colorlessness, achieved by fewer than 1% of all diamonds globally. These pinnacle specimens command substantial premiums over near-colorless grades, entering a realm where geological perfection meets collector passion.

A 1.00-carat D-color, VS1 clarity diamond costs $6,170, while the same diamond in H-color is $3,790.  Though you'll pay 60% more for the colorless grade, many people can't see the difference between these colors.

This definitive guide provides simple yet smart strategies for navigating the D color diamonds market, making sure you make an informed decision.

# Bottom Line:

D color diamonds represent the pinnacle of colorlessness in the diamond world. Here's what you need to know:

* Perfect Color: D diamonds are completely colorless, ranking highest on the GIA scale.
* Extreme Rarity: Less than 1% of diamonds are D color, making them highly coveted.
* Visual Differences: To the naked eye, D diamonds look nearly identical to E or F colors.
* Setting Recommendations: Platinum or white gold settings best showcase D color diamonds.
* Emotional Value: Many buyers are drawn to the prestige of owning a top-tier gemstone.
* Lab-grown diamonds offer significant cost savings compared to natural diamonds. A D-color lab-grown diamond typically costs 70-80% less than its natural counterpart, allowing you to either save substantially or invest in a larger, higher-quality stone.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

Cons:

* High price point may not fit every budget
* Differences between D and lower grades often invisible to the naked eye
* Value may not appreciate significantly over time

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Consider your priorities: Decide if the prestige of a D color is worth the premium over nearly identical E or F colors.
2. Evaluate the setting: If choosing a D color, opt for platinum or white gold to enhance its colorlessness.
3. Compare with lower grades: Look at G or H color diamonds for potential savings without sacrificing much visual appeal.

1. Consider lab-grown options: For the D color look at a fraction of the cost, explore lab-created diamonds.
2. Focus on cut quality: A well-cut lower color grade can often appear brighter than a poorly cut D color diamond.
3. Get expert opinions: Consult with gemologists or use high-quality images to assess the diamond's appearance.

1hc4lbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/1hc4lbd/making_a_mug_in_blender/,Making a mug in blender,"I started learning blender recently and last week I followed the donut tutorial everyone was sudgesting me. It helped a lot. now I want to try something out by myself. I came up with the idea of making a mug with coffee in it and maybe (if I'm not lazy enough) a newsletter next to it to make look like a morning coffee with newspaper in the final render. this is what I have so far: For the countertop i make a plane and for the mug I used a circle, created the face (f) extruded the edges and scaled them out for the angle. added a solidify modifier and beveled the rim and the base. the handle is a torus that I cut in half.

https://preview.redd.it/7m2zu7drea6e1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e91fb93ba02f612d67bf7c03432bb87401c79ec

A week ago I would not be able to do this in the matter of 3-4 minutes thanks to the tutorial but still i have some points that make me stop. for one I can not scale the texture because it looks just to big compared to the mug. I could scale up the mug but this would not solve the problem in the long run. also I cant figure out how I can add a normal map without going in the uv editing tab (still a bit overwhelmed by the whole different modes like nodes and shading)

The other two problems is that i want the profile of the handle look more like a real handle. For now it is just a torus. I tried to use grab with propotional editing on but this looked off.

https://preview.redd.it/wmxxr5iwea6e1.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5b303ca08c5d7b0b3ef7ecf171f79c64be1872a

I also used the loop tool - bridge edges after creating some loop cuts. that went horribly wrong. So I sticked to the torus for now and deleted one half. But since I want to bevel the part where the handle connects to the mug I have to somhow connect the two. i tried Ctrl + J (join) but it did nothing good and so did the merge by distace tool. Now I'm left with overlapping vertices that I cant join.

As for the coffee, i made an other circle with a face and extruded the edges and beveled them to give the effect of surface tension a fluid typicly has. now I want to add some bubbles and texture but dont know if I shoud just put an image texture in and call it a day or try out the geometry nodes (stiff afraid of using that $h!t).

https://preview.redd.it/xx2z3ihyea6e1.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=6574dcd65e259df47c54668547a5a7952a885872

What do you guys thing? is there something i already did wring making the mug are there more efficient ways of making that scene?

I think he spiked me because I can remember my legs going from underneath me and I needed to lie down. So he leads me into his bedroom and I lay there.

He ends up coming onto me and I just remember the feeling of his hand running up and down my body. I tried to fight but my muscles were weak and I was dazed so I just gave in... It was like how your body feels in a dream where it is all sluggish and wrong.

He forced me to blow him. It felt a bit sore when he put it in me and he just held me down and bucked his hips and I went numb.

He then forced me onto my knees and put it in me from behind and it started feeling good and I moaned and I wanted to die. Like a feeling of just kill me instead of this. He was groaning and saying stuff like I'm going to ""cum in your cunt"" and shit and he like held my face into the pillow and i was muffled saying no please no. I remember somehow turning onto my back to breathe and him just covering over me, holding me down and feeling a flush across my body and then starting to cry and he came inside me. I just lay there. I just got out as soon as I could. 

I've never ever told anyone this... It's haunted me since the it happened and I hate myself for all of it. ",2,1733952337.0,confessions,2,0.6,False
1hc4j9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1hc4j9y/my_husband_spent_my_21st_birthday_at_the_bar/,My husband spent my 21st birthday at the bar while I had to stay home. I'm still mad.,"I ""F21"" just had my 21st birthday 2 days ago. I spent it at the emergency dentist and found out I need emergency oral surgery so i scheduled it for Friday. Anyways, my husband ""M22"" and I have 2 kids together ""F3"" and ""M2"". My husband goes to the bar almost every night after work with his work buddies. Leaving me to sit at home with the kids. I'm a stay at home mom. I don't get to do anything for myself or by myself. My husband on the other hand gets to go out whenever he wants. I didn't feel like celebrating my birthday because i was about to be on antibiotics and pain killers, So I just wanted to stay home and watch a few movies and just be together. My husband wasn't having it. He wouldn't let it go that he wanted to go and have a few beers. Everytime I pleaded with him he'd just say "" so you don't like the necklace I got you"" (he got me a beautiful necklace I thanked him for. )

 He went anyways. The kids were overtired from having to stay with grandparents while I went to the dentist so they didn't nap. They wouldn't go down and were both screaming for what felt like an eternity before finally getting to sleep. Not at all how I wanted to spend my 21st birthday 😕. 
 

This might be the straw that breaks the camels back. He doesn't clean, gets to sleep off the previous nights hangovers, gets to go out often, spends what little money we have, doesn't help me with the kids. He acts so righteous because he works a demanding blue collar job and makes money while I am home with the kids. He yells at me for spending $170 on groceries while that's the only money I spend except on gas and a Starbucks coffee once in a while. I'm home 80% of the time. I'm done begging him to be better. He will straight up tell me he won't. He's great sometimes. I'm tired of sometimes. I threw him a party for his birthday and I spent mine dealing with screaming kids alone. I'm seriously considering Divorce. I apologize if this isn't well written.

1hc4ihz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1hc4ihz/ro_let_go/,[RO] Let go,"The winter cold makes it hard to forget her warmth. It’s been a little over one month since we broke up, but sometimes, when the wind whistles through the trees, it feels like her name is carried in its song. Love, I realized, is an unexpectedly tragic concept. We don’t choose who burns into our hearts, just as we don’t choose our favorite song. Somewhere in the labyrinth of our minds, an algorithm flips a switch. And for someone like me, someone who craves control, love is terrifying. It arrives uninvited, turning your life upside down.

You can confess and risk rejection, or bury it deep and let it fester. Pain is inevitable either way. So, I’ve made my choice: no more chasing relationships. Not now. Maybe not ever. Med school is my escape, a distraction so consuming that it silences the echoes of her voice most days.

Still, there are moments–quiet ones–when the city sleeps–when I feel the emotion filled balloon growing tighter. I’ve been blowing air into it for weeks now, holding my breath, waiting for the inevitable pop. But it holds. For now.

Life doesn’t leave room for anything else. There’s no time to process, no chance to untangle the chaos in my head. Just exams, lectures, and the gnawing certainty that someday soon, the balloon will burst.

As a med student my routine usually consists of boundless misery in the morning, dragging myself down from the warm heaven of my bed to face the cold, mundane errands of earthly existence. Another episode of *‘Why Did I Even Sign Up for This?’*, now streaming daily. Ever since September I've been living alone in an apartment complex. Then I crave some form of caffeinated salvation to speed up my misery, then trudge to the tram stop.

Once aboard, there’s a strange kind of surrender. All the times are fixed; once you’re inside, there’s nothing to do but wait for your destination. It’s a peculiar peacefulness—a relief in helplessness. The world outside blurs into gray smudges, and I’m left alone with my thoughts.

This is when my mind begins its daily eclipse, shifting between overthinking and scattered observations. The tram jerks forward, and I catch the faces of strangers. Some are exhausted like me, others detached, buried in books or phones. For a moment, I wonder if they’re better at pretending than I am, or if their silence hides the same chaos. Maybe we’re all stuck on trams of our own making, moving along tracks we didn’t choose but can’t escape. A child’s laughter breaks through my spiraling thoughts. On the tram, a toddler clutches their parent’s hand. The image stings—a reminder of something lost.

Just as I start to lose myself in these thoughts comforted and unnerved by their weight the speaker jolts me back to reality: *Schottentor.* My stop.

The university is close to here. My classmates are decent, and medicine demands teamwork. Thus, I make efforts to stay on good terms with everyone—not too close, but enough for a reliable lab partner. Over time, though, I’ve distanced myself without realizing it. I’ve stopped trying to connect. Loneliness creeps in occasionally, sharp and unforgiving, but detachment feels safer. Is it self-preservation or cowardice? I can’t tell anymore.

Nevertheless, before I realize it, classes end, and people leave as I slowly clean the desk into my backpack. I’m not even paying attention to half the classes lately. It’s almost like I’ve locked myself inside a room in my mind, a room with no windows, only walls that grow higher every day.

On the way out I glance through the class window. Sun has already set, and snow is falling slowly. Back in the apartment, I turn on a kettle for tea, and reach out for a chipped cup. A coffee cup she gave me. I threw out everything else that reminded me of her—everything but this. She used to talk about how “*chipped cups are bad luck, toss it*”. Yet, here I am drinking from it everyday, trying to prove her wrong. The chipped handle almost resembles our broken relationship. Maybe if I can still drink from it, there’s hope for something whole to come from broken things. Then the memory of her giving it to me saying “I painted your name on it myself!” with the promise of forever washes over me. The kettle clicks off as I drown in days gone by. I turn off the stove and don’t even bother to pour the tea, quickly grabbing my coat to head upstairs.

The rooftop bench has become all too familiar for me. A safe place to suffocate in thoughts. I’ve been walking the same steps every day. Same tram, same bench, same isolation. But the cold is different today. There’s something else in the air. Maybe it's the snow, maybe it’s me. The cold bites harder up here. My breath fogs the air, dissipating like every thought I’ve tried to suppress. The city stretches below, indifferent. Rooftops and chimneys, cars crawling like blood through veins. I slump onto the bench, the familiar one near the edge. The wooden slats are dusted with snow, and my hands burn against the icy surface. But I don’t move. Love felt like a lie I’d been sold, until it wasn’t. Even now, I want to hate her, to erase every trace of her from me. But hating her feels like hating the only part of myself that dared to hope. Regrets crowd in, one by one, until they press like hands against my ribs

*What did I do wrong? Or was it always going to end this way?*

*After all of the moments we’ve shared, only feeling I have left is hollowness and fear of trying again*Voice within me has become too loud, and I blow into the balloon… there is no more room. Walls close in as bitter frustrations finally form into tears. The cold wind hits me, teardrops on my face puncture my skin. In the quiet of the rooftop, the wind shifts. The rooftop feels colder than usual tonight. As I sit, the sensation creeps in—like the snow isn’t the only thing watching. I shrug it off, burying my face in my hands. The wind howls louder, almost speaking, but the words are lost in its icy breath. There’s a faint movement, a shadow that doesn't match the others. It’s almost as if the world itself is holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. Through the endless stream of regret I feel a warm hand on my cheek. I look up:

*“You cry like someone who’s dying”*  a girl I have never seen before, breaking the silence.

*“What?”* I flinch between embarrassment and disbelief.

*“It hurts, doesn’t it?”* she murmurs sitting beside me, gaze fixed on the city below.

For a moment, I forget the snow, the wind, the balloon in my chest ready to burst. “Who are you?” I ask, though the words barely leave my lips.

She doesn’t answer. Instead, she turns to me, her eyes searching mine. *“Why are you holding on to it?”*

Her skin white as the snow, dark eyes, white scarf and hair the shades of autumn leaves. I was instantly entranced by her sudden appearance and just how beautiful she was. Before I could comprehend just what was transpiring she retracts her hand and starts walking. She moves like a breeze, weightless against the biting wind, her eyes cutting through the haze of my thoughts. Is she real? Does it matter? The balloon inside me deflates, replaced by something I can’t describe. Before I can speak, she walks to the edge of the roof.

*“Wait!”* I scramble to my feet, the panic in my voice sharper than I intended. *“Don’t—don’t jump!”*

She looks back, her smile faint but unyielding. *“Why not?”* She leaned on the edge, her scarf trailing in the wind like a tether to the ground.

The question hits me like a slap. Why not? My thoughts stumble over each other. *“Because… I don’t want to lose someone else”* I say, the words spilling out before I can stop them.

She tilts her head, studying me. *“That’s a terrible reason.”*

*“Maybe”* I admit, stepping closer. *“But it’s the truth.”*

She lets me guide her down from the ledge, her hand cold but steady in mine. For a second, I thought the wind had gotten creative and sculpted a snow-woman. Turns out, it’s just someone else with a questionable sense of self-preservation. “Let’s leave” I asserted. Neither of us speaks as we descend the stairs. Back in my apartment, she moves silently, her bare feet making no sound on the wooden floor.

*“You live like someone who doesn’t want to be seen”* she says, her eyes scanning the sparse room.

*“It’s not like I want to live like this”* I reply, defensive. *“I’m just busy…busy with med school, you know”*

*“Busy trying to forget?”* her statement caught me off guard.

Trying to ground myself I ask *“Would you like something? Coffee, tea?”*

*“Tea is fine.”*

I pour the tea from earlier, now lukewarm, and sit across from her beside the kitchen counter. She cups the chipped mug running her finger across like it holds a secret. For the first time in weeks, my chest feels lighter, as if her presence has taken some of its weight.

*“Who are you?”* I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

*“Names are irrelevant for ones who won't be staying for long.”*

*“That’s not ominous at all”*

*“You’re one to talk, Nicolai”*

*My breath catches. “How do you know my name?”*

*“I’ve known you for a long time”*

*“What are you? A stalker?”*

*“If you want to call me that, then yeah sure”*

*“Wait, seriously?!”*

*“Relax, I just saw it on the cup”* 

I exhale, half relieved, half irritated *“Do you live somewhere close? Or creeping people out your full-time gig?”*

*“Define close. Spiritually? Yes, physically? Sort of”*

*“That’s not vague at all.”* 

*“I moved here recently. Only that I don’t have furniture yet”* She pauses, watching me carefully. *“Do you mind if I spend the night here?”*

*“You don’t even know me”*

*“I don’t need to, you’ll let me”* She shrugs *“And you’d rather have me inside than out there right?”*

I hesitate, but something about her confidence and the strange sense of calm she brings makes me nod. *“Fine. You can take the bed. I’ve got studying to do anyway.”*

*“Thanks”*

She stands and moves towards the sofa, the chipped cup still in her hand. As she sets it down, her fingers linger on it for just a moment too long. *“Funny isn’t it?”* she murmurs *“The things we hold onto.”*

Her comment made me think why I was keeping that mug in the first place. Whenever I try to dump it, I just can’t. it’s the only piece of her I have left—the one thing tethering me to when I was happy. If I throw it away, what was the point of it all? People start relationships and one thing leads to another then they breakup, find someone else. Repeat the cycle until what exactly? Until you find the “One”? Honestly, it seems like a very painful path with a reward that’s way too hypothetical. 

“Thinking much?” her remark bolts me back to my kitchen counter.

“Oh sorry, I just spaced out, you need something?” slightly startled

“No, but it seems like you’re the one who needs something” she says in an amused tone.

“Only thing I need now is decent grades” I replied sarcastically

“Addition to that you need someone to talk about it”

“Talk about what exactly?”

“What you were thinking about”

“Mostly about pizza, to be honest and what makes you think I’d open up to you anyway?”

“Seems like you have no one else”

“How do you know that?”

“You were crying alone on the rooftop”

“You’re the one who was about to jump alone.”

She looks at me with a faint grin “Then let's jump together”

“No one’s jumping tonight. Not off rooftops, and definitely not to conclusions.”

“Okay then. Talk to me. Give me a reason to stay. Or maybe the roof is where I belong.”

“You’re seriously threatening me with your life? Just so that I open up to you?”

“It’s a win-win situation. You get to have a companion and I get to know you better”

I couldn’t believe I was agreeing to this. Every instinct screamed at me to say no, to tell her to leave. But the truth was, I didn’t want her to go. Not yet. After contemplating for a moment I mutter “Okay fine, I can talk, but why do you care?”

She just stands up and starts walking to the door. Annoyed and concerned, I quickly say “Okay, okay! I get it, come back.”. She turns back smiling, relieved we both sat on the floor facing each other. 

“So what was she like?” the strange girl asks directly without any hesitation.

“How do you know about her?”

“You have a cup with your name on it” She casually picks up the cup and rotates it, inspecting “And you don’t look like the self-obsessed type. So someone must have given it to you” she puts down the mug “If it’s not family then it must have been from a very close person, probably a she.”

“I said no jumping into conclusions” shocked by her seemingly flawless deduction

“I’m right aren’t I?” she asks smirking

“Yes, you are right. Satisfied?” I answered reluctantly.

“Not until you talk”

“I’ll talk if you tell me your name first.”

“Hmm…You can call me Rae. For now. Satisfied?” she crosses her arms “So, was she worth keeping the mug?”

“Finally putting a name to the face is nice. I guess it can’t be helped.”

“Yuuup” Rae answered excitedly

“Well, She was…someone who made everything feel lighter. When she smiled, it felt like the world paused for a second, just to take her in. She had this laugh—it wasn’t perfect, kind of snorted at the end, but it made you want to laugh too, even if the joke was terrible.”

I pause, wondering if I’m saying too much, but Rae’s expression doesn’t change. She leans in slightly, as if waiting for me to continue.

“She was kind, too kind maybe. Always taking care of others, even when it drained her. I guess that’s what drew me to her. She made me want to be better—or at least feel like I could be. And I ruined it.”

Rae tilts her head, curiosity or judgment—maybe both—in her eyes. “How?”

“By being me,” I say, shrugging as if that explains everything. “Overthinking, second-guessing, always expecting the worst. I guess she got tired of trying to pull me out of my own head. Can’t blame her. Hell, even I’m tired of it. She deserves someone who doesn’t mentally script their grocery store conversations three days in advance.”

For a moment, Rae says nothing. She just looks at me, her gaze softer now, less like she’s probing for answers and more like she’s seeing me for the first time. “And you think that’s why she left?”

I hesitate. “She didn’t leave. I pushed her away. It was like…if I hurt her first, I could control it. Make it hurt less when she eventually realized I wasn’t worth it.”

“And did it hurt less?”

The question hangs in the air, sharp and unavoidable. I don’t answer. I can’t.

Rae sighs and leans back against the wall, her tone turning thoughtful. “You know, for someone who’s supposedly busy with med school, you spend a lot of time running away from yourself. Maybe you’re not tired of her leaving—maybe you’re tired of never staying.”

Her words hit like a punch to the chest, leaving me breathless and angry. “You don’t know anything about me.”

“Maybe not. But I know what it looks like when someone’s holding onto a ghost. You’re holding on to her like she’s the reason you’re alive,” Rae says, tapping the cup. “But is she? Or are you just afraid of who you are without her?”

The silence stretches, heavy with unspoken truths. Rae doesn’t press further, though, and for that, I’m both grateful and resentful. Instead, she picks up the cup and takes a sip, as if to give me space to figure out what to say next. Or maybe to make me realize there’s nothing left to say.

“You know what? Enough about me, you dodge a lot of questions. What are you running from?” I asked breaking the silence

“You don’t need to know, questions about me weren't in the deal anyway” Rae says in a defensive tone.

Somewhat irritated and curious, I utter “Oh come on. After all I’ve told, you can tell me”

“If you keep pushing I’ll have to go” She stands up and starts slowly walking towards the corridor.

Panic rising again “Okay, okay! Don’t go to the roof again. I won’t push you if you don’t want to answer.” 

She looks back smiling “Relax, I’m just going to your bed. It’s late, maybe I’ll answer tomorrow if you’re still curious.”

I released a reassured sigh “Oh, right…Goodnight.”

“Goodnight” She says, closing the bedroom door.

Looking at the clock; 3:21AM. Well, it’s too late for studies, tomorrow is Saturday anyway. Thinking that, I slump into the sofa and close my eyes. I wonder why Rae was on the roof, let alone about to jump. Maybe she also lost someone close? Or maybe something else. Even then any reason doesn’t make this situation any less peculiar. One moment I was attending an anatomy lecture and now I literally have a stranger sleeping on my bed. My life just keeps getting weirder. But one thing is certain: I really wanna know more about her. At least sharing my misery with someone made my chest feel lighter. More questions than thoughts spinning in my mind ever so slightly without knowing I doze off.

Saturday morning 9:15 am. The sound of a door closing wakes me up. Rubbing my eyes I get up and steer myself to the bathroom. Pushing down the door handle, it’s locked. From the bathroom a soft voice says “Occupied!”

Then yesterday’s events flood back. “Oh right, sorry” my voice still raspy from waking up. After a few minutes of standing against the wall I asked her “Do you have any plans for today?” 

Running water from the tap is heard and the voice “Not really, why?”. 

“I was thinking about going to the christmas market today” Scratching the back of my head I ask “I thought maybe you could come with me?”. 

The lock clicks and Rae opens the door, “Sorry what did you say? I couldn’t hear from the running water.” Rae steps out, towel draped over her head, damp hair clinging to her face. She looks adorable, but—“Wait, is that my towel?” 

She shrugs. “Yeah. I don’t have anything from my old place. Just this once, okay?”

Very agitated I said “You’re lucky I have two. Maybe ask next time.” Did I just say ‘next time’? What next time? She’s not staying, not permanently. But the idea lingers, stubborn and uninvited. Get a grip, Nicolai.

She tosses the towel to the laundry basket “Sorry to keep your bladder waiting.” smirking. Damn, she’s right, my bladder’s about to explode. I rush into the bathroom brushing off the lingering thought of her borrowing my towel and perform my morning routine. Showering, brushing teeth, usual stuff. While drying my hair my eyes fixate on the wet towel. *Doesn’t really look wet at all* I pondered as I reached for the laundry basket. She knocks on the door “You’re not doing anything weird in there are you?” 

Startled, I respond “Can I please enjoy my morning in peace?” She laughs “I’m just messing with you, please take your time”. *Forget about the towel, you’re not a pervert,* I mumble to myself and get dressed. 

In the living room she prepared drinks for both of us. Pleasantly surprised, I remark “You’re feeling at home.”

Rae looks at me subtly scanning me Rae hands me a chipped mug. “Black coffee, right? You didn’t have milk or sugar.”

I sat down across from her. “I used to drink latte, but... extra expenses and all.”

She raises an eyebrow. “So you like the taste of black coffee?”

I sip–*bitter as hell*, “No, not really. It honestly tastes like gasoline most of the time.” 

She tilts her head. “Then why drink it?”

“Only for the energy boost.” 

“Do you always see things as just tools?” Rae asked, her gaze steady on mine.

“What do you mean?”

“You hate it but still drink it. Why?”

“For the energy, like I said.”

“You don’t even enjoy it? That’s... kind of sad, honestly.” She leans back, watching me. “Life’s not just about what works. You’ve got to find the small joys. Otherwise, what’s the point?”

‘Sad? It’s practical. Efficient.” But her words plant a splinter of doubt I can’t quite ignore.

“Don’t worry you’ll get it soon enough” Rae puts down the cup, a few drops of tea still left in the bottom. “You were saying something while I was in the bathroom. What was it?”

“Right, I was thinking about going to the christmas market today.”

“So you actually do other stuff than just studying and staring at the ceiling? That’s good to know”

Somewhat offended I mutter “You can’t just judge me from one night.” That sounded way more intimate than I intended.

She leans closer “So you’re going alone?”

I sit with the thought of whether I should ask her to come with me or not. “Well, if you’re free…then you can come with me” 

“A Christmas market? Bold. Planning the first date already?”

“It’s not a date!”

“Relax, I’m kidding. Or am I?”

“So are you coming or not?” I asked, growing impatient.

“Sure! We can go. But only if we walk there.” she tilts her head

“But why walk in the cold, when there is a metro? Or is your transit pass also in your old place?”

“It’s not about tickets. It would be better to converse while walking instead of whispering in the metro, don't you think?”

“That’s actually a good point”

Rae stands up “I’ll go get dressed, let’s meet outside in 15 mins” she picks up her scarf and leaves to her apartment.

I nodded in agreement and look at the clock; 10:00AM. She leaves and I do the dishes while thinking about what to wear. As I scrub the chipped mug, for a moment I think about tossing it to the bin. I stare at the mug for a few moments, contemplating. “*Not yet” c*ame out of my mouth. I placed it on the shelf and closed it. Grabbing my stuff I checked my phone; 10:22AM, shit I’m late. Descending the stairs as quickly as I can. Opening the entrance door almost instantly, refreshing cold air hits my face. Street is covered with snow and cars drive by, people standing, waiting for the traffic light to hit green. I look around. *Where is she?* I ask under my breath. 

Then ice cold hands cover my eyes. Shock from the cold quickly diffuses as she says “Knock, knock”. 

I play along “Oh god, who is it now?”

She chuckles “Your guardian angel!”. 

""Guardian angel?"" I scoff, prying her hands off my face. ""I don't remember summoning one, but if you're here to smite my enemies, we can talk.""

She spins around to face me, grinning. ""What enemies could *you* possibly have?""

I shrug, deadpan. ""The mug in my sink is plotting something. You caught me mid-battle.""

She laughs, shaking her head. ""You’re impossible, Nicolai.""

""And yet, here you are,"" I reply, gesturing down the street. ""Shall we?""

As we start walking Rae asks “What took you long?”

“Doing the dishes took a bit of time”

Her eyes widened laughing “Oh so it took you 20 mins to clean 2 cups? You’re a terrible liar.”

Slightly embarrassed by my poor attempt at deceit I mutter “Okay you got me, I was just thinking about what to wear.”

“Even then you look way underdressed, you’ll freeze.” she said, unwinding the scarf from her neck. I didn’t take it, and she laughed. “Suit yourself”

“You overthink everything, Nicolai. Even your wardrobe has trust issues.”

""And you don’t think enough,"" I said, dodging a stray snowball a kid lobbed across the street. ""Together we’re almost functional."" We both chuckle.

Conversation keeps flowing as we get closer to the market, I realize some people are looking at me weird. But they don’t seem to acknowledge Rae that much. I shrug it off, probably it’s just some paranoia. Plus I was having a great time with her anyway, so who cares. 

When we arrived at our destination there were people everywhere, mostly tourists. One of the best things around this time of the year is Christmas, which is celebrated with such enthusiasm and liveliness. Every corner of the street is covered with glistening lights, stands selling souvenirs, hot chocolate and eatery. It’s impossible not to feel uplifted. 

We walked around a bit deciding on what to try.

Just as we’re waiting in line for some hot chocolate. Rae tells me “I need to go to the bathroom. Get the hot chocolate and find a table. I’ll be back soon!” 

“Okay, gotcha, do you want anything to eat?”

“No thanks!” she said, walking off.

I stand and wait for my turn. Slowly one by one people get their order. Only three people remain before me. One right in front of me looks like a student, and the other two are a hand holding couple. My eyes focus on the couple just a moment longer than it should’ve. The girl has a lilac knit cap on, I can hardly discern any specific facial features but that lilac knit cap. I’d seen it before, countless times, tossed carelessly on her couch. My stomach twisted. No, it couldn’t be her.

The cashier handed them their drink. ""And for the lovebirds, here are your hot wines. Enjoy!""

As they turned, her gaze locked onto mine. My heart stuttered. Indifference. Total disinterest. She looked past me like I was nothing, and then she walked off, hand-in-hand with him.

The world tilted. Anger surged, sharp and hot, mixing with something uglier—humiliation. I could barely breathe. She had moved on in a month. Not just moved on—forgotten. I stood there, frozen, my fists clenching against the thought. Seeing her with someone else felt like a gut punch. For her, a month was enough to move on completely.

“Sir! What would you like?!” The cashier’s shout snapped me out of my spiral.

“Two hot chocolates,” I muttered, barely audible. My voice felt like it belonged to someone else.

 While he fills the paper cups, I wonder if I should just leave and go back home. I didn't want to see them again or ever. But I couldn’t leave without telling Rae. 

So, I reluctantly found a seat and reserved one for her. I could still see them from far behind. Trying to distract myself I took a sip. As the rich, velvety warmth spread through me, it felt absurdly profound. A tiny thing—a sip of chocolate—cut through the storm in my chest. It finally clicked to me maybe Rae was right*: small joys mattered. Letting her ruin this would be giving her too much power. Too much of me*. The hot chocolate sweetens my mood.

While I rollercoaster through the five stages of grief I see Rae coming towards me. I couldn’t help but to smile. 

Rae plopped down beside me, sliding her gloves off with a dramatic sigh. 'You look like you’ve seen a ghost. Or worse—a bad haircut.”

Staring at the gently steaming cup I tell her “You should just try this hot chocolate. There is something special to it.”

She picks up the cup “Special what? Did they start selling spiked hot chocolate? Because it’s about time.”

Her deadpan delivery nearly made me spit out my drink. I barely managed to swallow, laughing. Scanning around, I spotted a grill stand. “Hey, Rae, see that stand selling those giant hotdogs?”

She followed my gaze “Yeah, why?”

“Wanna see who can finish it faster?” It was a dumb suggestion, but I wasn’t ready for this to end yet. Her laughter was better than the hot chocolate, and I’d take any excuse to stretch out the moment.

She looks at me grinning “Ohhh ho-ho, mister you don’t know what you’ve just started”...

We spent the next few hours eating, laughing, and arguing over who technically won the hotdog race. Rae accusing me of cheating as I finished the last bite of my hotdog. The golden glow of the market lights deepened as the sun dipped below the horizon. The air grew sharper, but neither of us seemed to notice. We were too busy laughing. The bustling crowd seemed smaller now, but Rae’s energy never wavered. She looked as vibrant as when I first saw her that morning.

“That was great,” I said, though the exhaustion I felt wasn’t just from the food. “I think I’ve had my fill for today. Wanna head back home?”

Rae pulled on her gloves, her smile still easy. “Today was nice,” she said. “You can go ahead. I need to swing by my old place to grab some things.”

“Oh. Want any help?”

She shook her head, already stepping away. “Nah, I’ve got it. I’ll see you later!”And just like that, she was gone, swallowed by the crowd and the swirling snow.

Then, suddenly, it hit me—I didn’t know anything about her. Not really. Just her name, which was probably an alias. Panic surged through me like an electric jolt. “Wait, Rae! I need your number!” I shouted after her. My voice felt too loud, too desperate against the muffled hum of the market. But she was already gone, leaving no trace behind.

The cheerful hum of the market suddenly felt distant, like I was watching it through frosted glass.

I stayed for a while longer, wandering aimlessly, as if hoping to see her again by chance. But it wasn’t the same without her. Everything tasted blander, the lights looked dimmer. Even the laughter of strangers grated on me. Eventually, I gave up and left, trudging through the snow toward home.

When I got back to my apartment, the silence hit me like a wall. I flicked on the lights and dropped my coat on the chair. The place felt smaller than usual. Sitting down on the couch, I leaned back, staring at the ceiling.

The walls felt closer tonight, the quiet pressing against my ears like a weight. It wasn’t an oppressive silence, just… empty. Rae’s laughter still rang faintly in my head, like an echo that refused to fade.

The day had been fun. Rae had been fun. But sitting here, alone, the laughter felt borrowed—like it had been on loan, and now I had to give it back.

But she’d be back. That’s what I told myself. She hadn’t left for good. So why did her leaving feel like someone had turned off the sun?

I sighed and glanced at my desk, where my exam schedule lay in a messy pile of papers. “Great,” I muttered. “I’ve got a mountain of work and, oh, an exam on Monday. That’s just fantastic.”

With a groan, I brewed some coffee and got to work, the smell of it bitter and comforting.

Days turned into weeks. Rae’s absence became a kind of phantom limb—painful but invisible. Life moved forward in its messy, uneven way. I passed exams, reconnected with classmates, even laughed a few times. But the rooftop stayed quiet.

The strange thing was, Rae never showed up again—not at the rooftop, not at the café, not anywhere. The usual places where I might’ve run into her were empty, void of the warmth she had brought.

I asked a few people, almost casually, if they’d seen her. Describing her felt surreal—dark hair, quick smile, the kind of sharp humor you don’t forget. But no one knew who I was talking about.

At first, I told myself she was busy. Or maybe she’d moved. But as time passed, the unanswered questions began to pile up, heavy and cold in my chest.

Had I imagined her? No. Rae was real—wasn’t she?

…

Late January, Saturday night. I sat up in bed, rubbing my eyes, the darkness of the room pressing in around me. The quiet felt different now, no sound of a door closing in the distance like it had been before. I hadn’t bothered to cook for myself in a while—too tired, too distracted—but tonight felt different. I had survived the exam period, and maybe it was time to break the habit of relying on fast food and takeout.

I turned on the stove, the soft click of the burner breaking the stillness. Pulling out a couple of eggs and sausages from the fridge, I started cooking. The eggs hit the pan with a satisfying sizzle, the once-translucent whites turning to snow white under the heat.

About to finish I looked for a plate around. Only a few dirty plates in the sink. *Ahhh, I’ll just clean it later.*

Opening the cupboard to grab a new plate, I froze. Tucked behind an unused jar of sugar was the chipped mug. I stared at it, unblinking, as if my brain was lagging behind what my eyes were seeing.

I picked up the chipped mug from the shelf and stared at it. Remembering how I told myself “Not yet”. But it was time to let things go—both the mug and whatever I was feeling. Without thinking any longer I toss it in the bin.

When the mug shattered, it was almost louder than it should have been. For a moment, I just stood there, staring into the trash bin as if the shards had something profound to say. They didn’t.

I looked around the apartment again—silent, dim, lifeless. It felt like the pieces of the mug had taken the warmth of the day with them, leaving only the cold edges of the night behind. The air was heavy, like it needed to be cracked open.

Without thinking, I grabbed my coat. I didn’t know where I was going, only that I couldn’t stay here. The streets were nearly empty now, the snow absorbing sound, muffling everything except the occasional crunch under my boots.

My feet carried me without direction, and before I knew it, I was standing in front of the stairwell to the rooftop. It had been months since I’d come up here. I hesitated at the door, unsure of what I was looking for—but then again, maybe that was the point.

Pushing it open, the icy wind hit me hard, stealing my breath for a moment. The city stretched out below, the lights twinkling faintly through the falling snow. For a second, I just stood there, letting the cold bite at my cheeks and ears. The rooftop was empty, but Rae’s memory lingered like a phantom, vivid and unshakable. I could almost see her on the ledge, her silhouette defiant against the winter night.

The bench was empty, but something caught my eye—dark against the white. A scarf. Rae’s scarf, the one she’d wrapped around her neck the first night we met.

I picked it up, the fabric stiff with cold but unmistakable. She hadn’t been here for weeks, so how—

I turned the scarf over in my hands. It smelled faintly of lavender, a scent I hadn’t noticed before. My chest tightened. For the first time, I didn’t try to explain it. I didn’t wonder how it got there or what it meant. It was enough that it was here, in my hands, real.

Back in my apartment, I folded the scarf and placed it carefully on the shelf where the chipped mug had sat. Then I closed the cupboard door, the sound sharp and final in the quiet room.

For the first time in months, I didn’t feel the weight of the past pressing on my chest. I thought of Rae’s words, her smile, her infuriating calm. Maybe she wasn’t real. Maybe she was. It didn’t matter anymore.

The scarf was proof of something—not of her, but of what she’d left behind.

And that was enough.

1hc4hou,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hc4hou/i_quit_last_sunday_and_feel_much_better/,I quit last Sunday and feel much better,"I quit coffee last Sunday and it was easy. I slept the whole day on Sunday but Monday was a good day. I quit in the past, too and had terrible body aches and headaches. But last week was much easier. Benefits I noticed: less acid reflux (this was the main reason I quit)-I get some these days but it's not noticeable. When I was on coffee the acid reflux was bad but I was in denial that it was bad. I also had this 'heaviness' in my belly from coffee and tension in my body.

I don't have that heaviness anymore, no body tension, less anxiety. The sleep is much better. And the last great benefit is sinuses improving. I used to get sinus pressure and pain but after quitting caffeine the pain dissapeared. Not sure if this is a coincidence, i hope it's not. 

Now, I'm not saying I'm going to be off caffeine for life. I don't know if i'm that strong. Coffee is more like a psychological drug for me, it gives me motivation and joy for living. Without coffee I get depressed and the motivation is not there. But I'll try to keep this new habit for a few months (my goal is to stay off caffeine for 6 months) and see how I feel.

NB: I started drinking coffee when I was 19-20 and continued until I was 40. I used to have 2 cups every day. If I can do it, you can, too. That voice in your head telling you that coffee is bad because it makes you feel bad (anxiety, insomnia, gut issues..) is right. So you should listen to it.",5,1733952218.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

1hc4cb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1hc4cb1/lost_friendship_group_of_20_years/,Lost friendship group of 20 years,"This year has been one of the most challenging (but most rewarding) of my life. I just heard from my (now former) best friend of 20 years, who texted to say she no longer wants to be friends. I knew it was coming and was already processing it and mourning the friendship, but it still hurts. 

For context, we fell out earlier this year. At the start of the year, I was going through probably the hardest time of my life. I ended a 6 year relationship with a man who I learned was grooming and emotionally abusing me. Breaking it off shattered my world and everything I knew—I was in survival mode, trying to make sense of everything, and so angry and so high adrenaline.

I’ll admit I was too heavy for my friends to handle at the time. I shared too much and probably leaned on them more than they could manage. In hindsight, I know I didn’t have the awareness or support I needed to cope differently. They said some really hard things to hear about me—things I still carry with me—and ultimately, I had to cut contact and take a few months away to focus on myself.

All of this actually resulted in me getting referred for my autism diagnosis and I finally spoke to the GP about it and got a therapist for a few months. Learning about autism has helped so much though and has pushed me to start making new friends with people who are also neurodivergent, or who at least, have more in common with me. It’s helped me to accept myself so much more and know that not everyone is going to accept me.

Just going through so much cognitive dissonance right now. It feels like such a big loss, I don’t feel I have anyone I could just grab a cup of coffee with or see a movie with.  I feel horrendous about being called “negative” and “heavy” and being told that my best friend hasn’t always felt valued or seen by me. But I’ve tried my absolute hardest with the tools and support I had.

Trying to be at peace with fact I can’t keep chasing people’s acceptance or apologising for who I am. Being autistic means I experience things more intensely, and while I’m learning to manage that, it doesn’t make me a bad person. I’m not going to keep masking or downplaying my truth to fit into rigid social rules—it’s exhausting and doesn’t serve me.

I wanted to share this here because I know I’m not alone in these feelings, and I’d love to hear from other autistic women who’ve gone through similar experiences.

1hc4ak9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hc4ak9,A peek of my collection (mostly Blind Buys) in one month.,"I have recently decided to get some mostly-arab frags. Especially to check if the quality has improved recently. Most of those buys were done after quite strong research. Thanks to the community for providing such a good source of reviews and opinions about those scents <3. Most of those buys were done on a good discounts so it was quite safe to do it and re-sell in case of bad choice.





1st Buy Top 3:

1. Afnan 9PM - I looooove the OG JPG Ultra Male so it was obvious for me that I have to try the 9PM and Ramz Silver. The 9PM is so well blended, so rich in scent. Although I felt like its not as powerful at the begining as poeple mentioned on the internet but... After one month I feel like I can already name it a beast mode and has improved quite much. Great choice. I can feel small differences and feels like theres more Apple notes in 9PM and more Pear and bubblegum in the Ultra Male.

2. Lattafa Kingdom - I like the JPG Elixir and I also like the Kingdom which seems to be quite similar to each other. Also sweet, warming and good vibes scent. But... I think I will let it sit for a month to check if it will get more power. People around me love this scent too!

3. Club de Nuit Intense Man - A bit more fresh scent than those two above and I really like it. I felt the synthetic side of the citrus notes but its more pleasant on the drydown. But... I was the only one of those poeple who tried it with me who noticed the synthetic side so maybe it's just my nose. Probably will wait for the summer.

Special mentions - Turathi Blue, Ishq Al Shuyukh, Ansaam Silver







2nd Buy Top 3:

1. Armaf Odyssey Mandarin Sky - This one blew my mind... I own the JPG Scandal and was curious how the mandarin notes could blend with scandal vibes... But it does it perfectly. The mandarin stays after the drydown too and its beast mode straight out of the box. Got 2nd bottle too and it's probably in my top3 ever.

2. Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa + Khamrah - So sweet scent and cake-style. People will feel like you are eatable when you wear it. And also its a beast mode - 3 sprays and you fill the room for sure. It's quite weird for me that people on the internet mentioned that the Coffee notes in Qahwa are noticeable only during first few minutes and then it dissapear. Not in my case for sure. I feel strong Coffee notes from the beginning and it lasts there for all the time. But maybe thats just the beauty of our hobby - every nose is different <3.

3. Vintage Radio - Honestly I appreciated this scent on the second day of testing it. It is rich in scents, elegant, strong and also unique - probably mostly because of the plum notes.


Special mentions - Club de Nuit Iconic + Club de Nuit Elixir + Malik Al Tayoor - Both of those CDN are really good, fresh and giving me good feeling. Probably will sit till the summer and I am going to wear them often but... Quite big suprise for me was the Malik Al Tayoor - So cheap but good for this price. Really good ""Y"" vibes and I like it much more than Fakhar. Really clean, fresh and pleasant to me.







Not regrets but not the best for me:

1. Lattafa His Confession - Probably its because of those Iris notes. Feels really like powder/lipstick vibe all the time. Quite boring for my nose and I cant feel much more. Probably other people will love it anyway. Bought it on a good discount so I will sell it the same price or even a small profit.

2. Oud Najdia - I dont know why but my nose doesnt like it. Its just unpleasant. It didn't meant to be fresh but I just cant imagine it on myself. But for sure there are fans of it too.






I am really happy that those buys were really good and guided by some reviews from the community. Maybe you have any recommentions for me based on my recent buys?

He was violently ill the morning before and we spent the majority of the trip where he wasn't at the conference resting in the room. Our last morning here we woke up, and he said he needed to get to a presentation around 11, and we agreed I would go to the venue with him and just hang around until it was time to leave for our flight. 

I finished packing much before him and was ready to go by 9:45 (our hotel check out was also at 11). I said I was going to get some coffee and food for us, and he asked for a tea from Starbucks. I wanted to get some pastries from an amazing bakery across the street for us to share as well. 

While I was at the bakery, one of the workers slipped and fell. In the chaos of making sure they were ok, it took my order quite a while to come out. At 10:15 my partner messaged me with a ""??!!??!"" And I explained the situation. I got my order soon and grabbed the coffee and tea and was in the room by 10:25. 

He absolutely lost it on me - called me selfish, knew that he would need help getting the bags out and getting the room ready for check out, that he only had one chance to make a first impression at this presentation and now he didn't know how he was going to make it. He said I couldn't put my coffee addiction off for one hour to stay there and help him, that I had no common sense and that I wasn't along for the ride. 

To be fair, I fought back. I said he was being cruel, that he could have asked me to come back, that he could have said ""I'm leaving in 5 minutes"". His response to this was that he has to manage everything in his life, even me. When he tore his luggage apart looking for his wallet, I threw some of his clothes across the room. It was not a pretty fight. He said we were over, that I did not understand the price of success for him.

Front desk guy is rude doesn’t help us initially while we wait and the days we’re too late because we need 15 min to fill out 6 pages of paperwork and the first appt (mine will be cancelled). I’m fine with that and then my husband cuts in and says I will take his. 

He refuses to take his slot. Doesn’t say anything but he says that he doesn’t want to. 

We argue while filling out intake paperwork. I have a day off each week and he doesn’t so I know he won’t come back. The Front desk girl interrupts and says I need to say my medical history which I skipped over with a slash. She asks if I have x conditions. I say no. I say I don’t have any of them. She says I have to fill out each box. I take the paper and say “well no one is gonna read them so why does it fucking matter?”

I know it was wrong and feel bad. Continue arguing with husband and then he finally admits he doesn’t want to wait and miss work. I reschedule and don’t really know how to apologize and we leave. I planned on bringing coffee or something next time. They call later and say they’re cancelling our appt because I was rude which I don’t blame them for. I still feel bad and wish I had a way to apologize to the actual girl. We didn’t exchange names. It would just make them uncomfortable if I showed up with an apology. Should I send a gift card? Don’t even know who to send it to. 

I’m generally quite and will accept whatever. I think I snapped because husband throws a lot of aggression and shuts down whenever he doesn’t feel like explaining things. ",2,1733951251.0,Truthoffmychest,7,1.0,False

I frequent this sub A LOT and wanted to post my 2024 ""year in review"" with the Marriott properties I've stayed at. The majority of my hotel selections I made due to suggestions from this sub. I *do not travel for business*, **only personal** (I do use my company's corporate rate now and again)

I've been a loyal SPG/Marriott customer since \~2015, and have only earned Platinum for the last two years, mostly with help from the Amex Brilliant card + spring time promotion of 1 bonus night + 1,000 points per night stay.

* 63 nights this year with only $5k spend
* 22 Paid nights
* 16 promotional
* 25 Marriott Bonvoy CC

Still have 3 SNA that will expire at the end of this month too, womp womp.



**FEBRUARY** 

**Williamsburg Lodge, Autograph Collection \[3 nights\] - Williamsburg, VA**

PROS: Fantastic location - walkable to everything and the shuttle stops right in front the hotel. Lobby smelled amazing and workers were nice.

CONS: Status not recognized, no breakfast, rooms are dated, housekeeping could improve (dirty Q-tips in corners of bathroom, lightbulbs burnt out, etc) and they charge for parking in their parking lot (however street parking is free). 

Final thoughts: Probably not worth the steep price - we went in February so it was off-season and prices were a bit lower, but you're definitely not receiving a high-end experience.

Earnings: +11.5K points

  
**MARCH**

**The Athenee Hotel, a Luxury Collection Hotel \[5 nights\] - Bangkok, Thailand**

PROS: Status recognized - upgraded room, breakfast as welcome gift, 2 pieces of dry cleaning PER DAY, wonderful executive lounge, magnificent rooftop swimming pool + wonderful customer service. Comfortable bed, spacious room, darkening blinds, free water.

I could write an entire post dedicated to the breakfast spread, but TLDR: one of the best I've seen. Eastern and Western options; omelet and fresh fruit juice stations, iced coffee, etc. 

Lounge was great for happy hour drinks, the food was alright but hit the spot. The only criticism I have is that it's not a walk-up bar situation, they take your order .. but sometimes that means it sometimes took 20+ minutes to wave someone down to get a beer.

CONS: Bangkok is huge so although the neighborhood was nice, its an \~hour+ to the major temple/tourist spots. 

Final thoughts: Would absolutely recommend and stay there again. The pool-side Pad See Ewe can't be beat.

Earnings: 16K points

**Courtyard Siem Reap Resort \[5 nights\] - Siem Reap, Cambodia**

PROS: Only marriott in the vicinity; status recognized in free breakfast as welcome gift. Nice rooms with balcony overlooking the huge pool. Customer service was amazing - fresh cold towels anytime you came back to the lobby (it was 100+ degrees while we were there) - ice cream at check-in. Pool floats in the pool. For the cost $100/night, it was well worth it.

CONS: Since it's newer, not many tuk-tuk drivers know where it is and it's a little further away from ""downtown"" so we were always quoted more, however it was a $2-$5 tuk-tuk drive each way so no complaints. You can't really walk anywhere, so tuk-tuks are the only option.

Final Thoughts: This is not your average Courtyard. Would definitely stay here again and I recommend Siem Reap to everyone reading. We felt safe and well taken care of.

**APRIL** 

**JW Marriott Hotel Singapore South Beach \[3 nights\] - Singapore**

PROS: Gorgeous, up-scale hotel from lobby all the way up to the rooms. No upgrade but chose breakfast (in lounge) as welcome gift. The executive lounge was one of the best I've seen and service was spectacular. A range of different food types and even a international cuisine station (one night was ramen, for example). I still think of those little triangular hash browns.

CONS: Expensive and not necessarily within walking distance to a lot - the pools were OK but water was freezing and the set-up is weird (there's no privacy and/or lounge chairs). Rooms are small but this is a common thing. 

Final Thoughts: Probably would try a different property next time depending on rates.

**JULY**

**Apollo Hotel Amsterdam, a Tribute Portfolio Hotel \[3 nights\], Amsterdam, Netherlands**

We had a split reservation because we added on a night in a separate reservation due to travel changes. 

The first room we had was first floor level, no natural light, no space in the room, and bathroom had a step up in the doorway which made you trip or stub your toe every time. A dungeon. Horrible half-glass shower, tepid water temp that made it miserable taking showers. It was AWFUL but we knew it was only for one night and that our ""2nd"" reservation was a better room + our SNA was approved.

The 2nd room ""suite"" we stayed in was three rooms, spacious, two TVS and a lovely bathroom with a full standing tub + fully enclosed shower. NIGHT AND DAY. Safe to say your experience will likely depend on what room type you are. 

PROS: Canal-view rooms are lovely, the breakfast spread was OK. Platinum status gets you a beer/wine and meatballs from the lobby ""bar"".

CONS: Location was brutal, long 10-15 minute walk to the metro that took another 15+ minutes to get into town. Not a great place to stay if you're first-timers to Amsterdam (we were not so we took the risk and I regretted it more than I thought) - No room service and bar drinks/food closes early, so not a lot of options after a certain point. 

Final Thoughts: Would not stay again, there are many other options.

**AUGUST**

**The Westin Philadelphia \[1 night\] - Philadelphia, PA**

PROS: SNA approved - didn't ask about breakfast because we had brunch plans the next day but overall the rooms were fine for the price. Location is great.

CONS: Not the standard of Westin I'm used to. We actually had booked 2 rooms and used the SNA on one, and got upgraded to another ""suite"" for the other; the SNA room was beautiful, separate sitting room space, 2 bathrooms. The other suite was weird - it was a regular room with some extra square footage and the bathroom was like an upgraded springhill suites bathroom. I wouldn't pay out of pocket for it.

Final Thoughts: Having stayed at many properties in Philly, this wasn't the worst or the best - I'd still probably defer to The Notary.

Earnings: 4K points

**DECEMBER**

**The Ritz Carlton, Chicago \[2 nights\] - Chicago, IL** 

PROS: Beautiful hotel, rooms were beautiful and was upgraded to a Lake-view room. Beds were comfortable, lots of channels on the TV and the bathrobes and amenities were amazing.

CONS: SNA Denied - No status recognition, no lounge access (was told the lounge is ran by Ritz-Carlton and not Marriott thus it would be $200/person). Customer service was abysmal. No help upon arrival (you have to take the elevator to the 12th floor lobby to check-in but that wasn't super obvious for new-comers) - no help with bags and the people at the front desk were not friendly nor did they really talk to us at all; they asked for a credit card and held $1500 (which is fine they just never told us) and they didn't explain anything to us at all, just gave us our key cards and that was that. 

Final Thoughts: Wouldn't stay there again. The customer experience was far below par and no status recognition just isn't worth it.

I think I could learn moderation but I don't even like drinking anymore. Sure when going to a concert or club or something it's nice to get you to loosen up and really enjoy the vibes. But I kind of fucking hate it. Alcohol I mean. I used to love it because honestly it made my life better. I was so anxious and depressed and traumatised and it brought out my genuine self I was scared to be but now it like does the opposite. It turns me into a crappy shell of anything good that I am. It helps me clean and that's it. I drink, I clean and then I black out and forgot if I actually cleaned properly like I was supposed to and then I vet shocked at how spotless it actually is and how quickly I cleaned. I'm mentioning this because most recently it's my drinking pattern. If I haven't drank the whole bottle throughout the day I'll take random swigs of it when I feel like I need the boost. Then when it eventually runs out I either freak out or am glad. Then I either what a few days or buy another bottle and then wait a few days. Just so I can say to myself I'm more than fine not drinking. Yesterday I took my sertraline right before I started to drink and of course as it always does caused me to sort of have a mini breakdown. I was surprised that my mother couldn't smell the alcohol on my breath. She usually can if I'm not smart about it. Clearly I had enough for me to eventually black out and the only other thing I had consumed that day was coffee. It was pure luck. Maybe as I had just had the coffee that's all she could smell idk. Today the entire beginning of the day I had insane hangxiety. I constantly felt like I was going to throw up due to how anxious, breathless and jittery I was. I missed an important appointment and I didn't do anything I was supposed to. I am so sick of this. Instead of helping me move on from trauma like it used to it just makes me waste the days. Such an unhealthy waste of time. It does help in certain aspects yes, but not enough to continue doing it. I'm scared to go to the meetings because I'm extremely worried about someone saying something sort of rude to me or someone saying something creepy to me or forcing me to speak and then judging me when I do. Overall I would not take this personally but since I'm so fragile right now it would feel like I'm being pushed when I'm already down. Especially since I cannot open up about this to my family, if I did it'd probably just drive me further down into the alcoholic trenches. I am also scared it's going to be a bunch of old British male boozers who think I'm absolutely ridiculous for even being there. All in a I have a problem which depresses me. The thought that I drink so much sometimes for no reason depresses. The thought that it holds me back in life depresses me. And I do not want to do it anymore. I don't need it.

I was together with this woman for two years. We've been apart for 3 now. I last saw her 2 years ago. I still think about her everyday. I've lived a lot of life since and still have never found anything like this love. 
---

Hey. I really hope the above doesn't disturb your peace. I've been in therapy for the last two years and been debating telling you this for a while, still not sure if I should but life is too short to leave things unsaid. I feel like I never thanked you enough for the things that you did for me. I also feel like I deeply wronged you and never gave you closure. I hope in some small way this closes whatever gap I left. If you're in a relationship or otherwise just don't feel like to need to hear any further from me, go ahead and delete all of this before reading it. I don't expect to hear back, and even if I do, I'm not sure what I would say.

So we've been apart much longer than we were ever together, and yet I still feel compelled to tell you this. It was my fault for convincing you to be in a relationship with me. I remember when I picked you up from your apartment in the January reconnected and went to go do donuts in that parking lot, at the end of the night I made you talk through your feelings for me. I did that because I knew I wanted to be in a relationship with you and wanted to know where you stood. But I also did that because I was deeply insecure about you and I, and needed to hear how you felt. You said were worried I'd move to the other side of the country in a few months and there'd be no point, but I insisted we chase our feelings. What I didn't know was that my insecurities would come back to haunt me, and I should've known better. I should've worked on them or made a decision to not be with you in an effort to not hurt you. It's why I hated being apart from you for even a week. Part of it was because I felt such a strong bond with you, being away from you felt like I couldn't breath. And another part of is was definitely the insecurities I had creeping back in. I feel responsible for the entire state and trajectory of our relationship, which ultimately failed. So it's my fault and I should've made better decisions to avoid hurting you. Even when I took you to Montreal, I just wanted to treat you like I always did and never thought through how it might otherwise impact your feelings.

I insisted on pushing through and making things work because ultimately despite all of the volatility things felt right with you. You were a perfect partner in so many ways and I liked watching you grow. There was a comfort I found in taking care of you and sleeping next to you. Even when things were volatile I deeply valued and appreciated your apologies. You were a good person with a pure heart, which is why I wanted to spend every moment with you. You also gave me stability and comfort while I started my career and was finishing school at the same time. I can't remember if I ever told you, but I went no contact with my parents for 4 months when I moved into that first apartment to be closer to you. It was a difficult time for me. I never thanked you for just being there for me, so thank you. I've since gone no contact for up to 14 months with them because of our differences - I know you always disliked they didn't know about you, but I just want you to know it was never anything personal. When I think back to all of my lived experiences, those two years and especially those four months where I slept next to you every night were the longest and most memorable two years of my life. Every little thing you did for me, I valued and held close to my heart. The letters and little notes, your painting, your gifts, convincing me to floss my teeth, being next to me all of those times I had strep and covid in college and that small town, the fine dining you treated me to, the impromptu cooking dates. All of it really mattered. 

All of is this is to say, you did nothing wrong. The last time I cried was almost two years ago now, and I guess now as I write this, when you came to say goodbye and I gave you those socks you left behind in that small town we lived in for six months. There was something about us that always made me feel like you were a part of my being and purpose, and at that moment I felt the puzzle being complete again while realizing it was only going to be for one moment longer. I also realized how far apart we'd grown and different we'd become, and that I held responsibility in that happening. And because of that, I'm not asking you for anything. I realize we're different and potentially incompatible people now. We were just babies when we met. You were 20, I was 22 when we went to that bar talking about you falling in a field of sunflowers and sampling nachos at restaurants. I'm almost 30 now. Maybe one day if our paths ever cross down the road it would be fun to grab a coffee to see where our lives have taken us. Or maybe it would just as best to leave it all to rest. I hope you're doing well wherever you are and pursuing your dreams, you have a genuinely good heart and you'll do well with whatever you end up pursuing in life.",9,1733950791.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

L-Theanine in tea lowers the cortisol response to the small amount of caffeine in it. It has antimicrobial effects too.

It's not expensive there's good ones on amazon, make sure it's organic. I don't recommend black tea as it's oxidized and usually low-quality. White tea is a good one but rare. If you're worried about oxalates in tea you can add a small amount of pure calcium carbonate to block their absorption.

Also chamomile tea at night is wonderful, increases GABA and even testosterone (apigenin).",5,1733950424.0,decaf,3,0.86,False
1hc3rmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1hc3rmx/just_realized_its_been_53_days_would_not_have/,"Just realized it's been 53 days, would not have believed it possible 54 days ago.","I've loved - absolutely loved - booze since I first tasted it more than 30 years ago. I've been a consistent daily drinker more or less that entire time. For whatever dumb lucky reason my blood panel and health stats are basically fine, but I'm 45 now and they're starting to trend downwards. I've had close calls with work, the law, even accidental death because of my drinking over the years but always skipped through consequence free. A growing feeling that my luck would run out has made me think about sobriety a bit more recently. I've been lurking in this sub for a while now, 2-3 years, curious about sober life but too scared (and comfortable) to give it a try.

So my 'bottom' isn't that bad, but the personal shame was enough to finally make me change track. Basically I passed out, hungover after a massive night, in the park one morning while watching my middle school daughter's soccer game. Not my first time fainting, not my first time experiencing that horrible, disorientating return to consciousness, not even my first time doing that face down in the middle of the day in a public park if I'm honest. But the first time ever that either of my kids saw that I wasn't a ""normal"" drinker. The first time they became aware that drinking wasn't just a nice thing that made adults silly, but something shameful and repulsive.

The next day I decided to just tell her the truth, instead making up some lie about illness like I've done before. I told her I was done, that drinking had finally got in the way of our family and it wasn't going to happen again. It was the push I needed to finally give sobriety a try. The contrast between her and her friends in the sun, energetic, happy, playing as a team, and me, alone, bleeding and bruised, covered in coffee, face down in the grass under a tree, is a dark and shameful part of me now. I'm hoping it turns into something good.

My wife, also a drinker - and in the past a problem drinker - has been amazingly supportive. She's cut back enormously. I had ridiculous cravings the first week but that's gone now, the idea of it has almost no appeal anymore. I have unfortunately gained weight and am now trying to figure out how to cut sugar out, but I am sleeping excellently, I've unlocked some new tier of sex I never knew existed, and I can feel the beginnings of my brain fog clearing. Best of all, I wake up every day proud of the man who went to bed, instead of cursing his weakness.

I had to take the first step myself, but I'm not sure I would have had the balls to try it without the stories I've been reading in this sub over the years, and the support that's here even for those of us who maybe haven't journeyed so far down but who've still been touched by the darkness.

My SIL (F27) has a degree as a vet tech. I (F26) have a degree as animal trainer. I've known her for about 7 years. She met my brother (M31) through me, when she used to be my best friend and are currently engaged with no plan to wed. I never really liked the way she treated animals but I was too scared to confront her and never did. It's however important to note that she has already exhibited weird and unhealthy behaviour with animals including hurting them as punishments.

Fast foward to 2/3 weeks ago:  
I'm now in a position where I've had extensive therapy for years (so I've improved on boundary setting and healthy confrontation) and am married with a son of almost 2. SIL bought herself her first horse after wanting one for ages. The horse is basically a pup, being 2 years old and I was extremely excited for her. I went with her, bringing my son, to the stables on both the first and second day she had him. On the second day my brother also joined. I was distracted playing with my son while out of the corner of my eye I see the horse about to nibble on SIL's jacket (he was really curious like that) when I hear a literally echoing ""PATS!"" with her hand around the nose area. So, both me, my son and my brother turn around like ""what happened?!"". I look at her and I see the horse backing up shaking its head up and down and looking upset, I was probably visibily confused because she started explaining to me that ""she had to put him straight right away before the horse would bite her skin"". I was so in shock that I couldnt react at the moment and decided to process my feelings first (therapy yay!). Afterwards she got closer to the horse to which the horse reacted skeptical of the hand. She then proceeded to say: ""Oh what? I give you one little hit and you're scared?!"" This means she knew and also saw that she hurt and scared him.   
The day after I send her a text telling her there's something I wanted to talk about but I wanted to do it face to face and that it was important to me. So I asked if she could maybe come over for coffee the same evening. She said she didn't have time for 2 weeks.. so I waited for 2 weeks.

Finally the doorbel rings at 7.30 on the agreed upon date. They (brother decided to join) come in and I ask how they're doing and they told me they're broken and tired (doesnt surprise me cause they've been having a rough patch in life for about a year now, mostly their own choices like buying a horse when broke but also health issues). We talk a bit about their day and I offer a drink, we all sit down.

I wanted to start the conversation in a nice way so I start by saying that I wanted to apologize for worrying them. I didn't fully stand behind the apology but I was sincere in saying I didn't want to worry them obviously and that I'm sorry about it. I hoped this would show my good graces. They don't really aknowledge the apology, SIL only keeps explaining all the reasons I had them worry and how I did things wrong but I let it go and apologized again, to no awknoledgement once more. We move on to the real deal as to why I called her over.

I explain to her that last time at the stables I saw something that shocked me quite a bit (and then explained factually what I saw). I told her I hoped she knew it wasn't okay to hit horses and that she just didn't realize how bad it was. She fully awknowleged she hit him, saying it was how she learned through experience (only experience she has is riding horses when she was 16) and school (she doesn't touch the subject of horses in course that she did and she didn't do any additional ones, I did).   
I told her once more that there's different ways of teaching a horse to not nibble at your stuff and potentially (accidentally) your skin.   
I also told her I understood what she meant and where she was coming from. I also come from a household where it was normal to hit our dogs, however I then later realized that I was hurting them and stopped, I simply said I dont think she realized yet and I would love it if she looked into different training methods.She repeated to me that if something like that isn't taught harshly and right away then the horse would never learn. My brother then pitched in, but not in a bad way. He simply explained he saw this show once where they did that with lions too (doesnt really matter).   
I told him, as well, that it was considered normal a long time ago, but we've since then come a long way into learning that it's never beneficial to hit and I really needed her to stop. Hearing that my brother also joined the conversation, my husband comes over and sits with us too, but is silent. He was there just to prevent things turning into a 2v1.  
SIL says then something that I really struggled with: ""With all due respect, it's MY horse so I will do with him whatever I see fit.""   
So I reply: ""Ok, Son is also my son, does that mean I can hit him?""They both struggle to reply and after a bit of silence I say once more that I need her to stop hitting, it's really not okay and it's literally forbidden by law (trying to avoid saying animal abuse). Pressing the urgency of the situation. I also press the fact that the horse was scared of her hand, that should already tell the urgency of it.   
She then tells me the horse isn't scared of her now and that he's fine. I once more urge that he was scared of her at that moment, and thats already going too far and I'm not okay with her hitting animals, or people, or anyone. (Up until now the conversation was calm and we let each other finish, from now on that stops).  
SIL stops me from continuing my arguments and says the 3 following things:  
1. I feel attacked  
2. This is insulting  
3. It's MY horse and I can do with him whatever I want  
At this point my brother intervenes saying he doens't have to take this, that it wasn't okay and starts standing up. My husband also intervenes, says to SIL that her behaviour was unacceptable from the start and he won't fall for the victim role she was putting up. Telling her once more she can't just hit animals like that (calmly).  
SIL stands up too. It's a little vague for me here cause I was struggling, but I hear SIL making insulted noises or just being generally shocked/angry. Honestly I remember her saying something but I can't remember what, only that it wasn't nice or productive. To which my husband said she needed to leave and that we don't accept animal abuse and by hitting animals she was a bad example to our son. They stood up. My brother argued some more, saying we can't just attack SIL like that.   
SIL left in the meantime and I was completely silent, shocked and zoned out. My husband told my brother that if she feels attacked for us putting up a boundary she's not welcome. My brother then replied that now he's putting up a boundary by saying we can't say this to SIL. My husband then told him that that wasn't how it worked and then told him that he also needed to leave.

After they left I started heavily crying and struggling. My husband calmed me down and then after a little bit I called my mom to tell her what happened and was helpful.  
The day after however (just now) she calls me saying she now also spoke to my brother and then proceeded to scold me because it wasnt okay that my husband showed my brother the door. She worded it as: ""(husbands name) showed YOUR FAMILY the door and thats not okay! You can't just let him do that! He's not mad with you he's mad with him!"" I defended my husband telling her that if he didn't, I would've, and that their behaviour was beyond disrespectful. That I was glad he stood up for me this way and that it wasn't okay for her (my mom) to scold me about this. I also asked her ""What about all the stuff they did? Is this really what we're focussing on?!"". And once more repeated that what my husband did was good and really effed up for us to do this. I didn't come out of nowhere.

To preface this, I am 23 years old and never graduated college. Instead, I got a job at a travel agency and now have about 4 years of corporate experience including operations, contract negotiation, pricing strategy, and data analysis. Before this, I even had many many years of customer service under my belt and have worked in a call center.  I still work at the same company and have worked my way up throughout the past few years, but my company provides extremely low compensation for the work I do compared to others. In addition to this, HR is virtually non-existent and it's a small company that does not uphold a good level of professionalism. This fall, I took a business analytics course to help buff my resume and am planning to take an official course for data analytics soon.)

^(I was kicked out of my parents when I turned 18 and used my savings to help get a cheap apartment with roommates. I am unable to go to college because I don't have the money to continue schooling as long as I have to pay rent (which will never end). ^(I am unable to take out loans because I don't have adult cosigners that can assist. I am not confident in my ability to juggle a 9-5 with night classes, which I know is my own problem.)

^(I have been applying to SO MANY jobs since last June across multiple platforms including LinkedIn, Glassdoor, Indeed and even some directly on the company websites.  I have had one company actually reach back out to me. I declined their offer because I ultimately decided that this company was not a good fit for me. I would say that monthly, I apply to 30-80 jobs that I believe I am qualified for and a few here and there where I have less than 90% of the requirements or preferred qualifications and simply have not heard anything. The jobs I have applied for are always for a variety of company sizes and are either hybrid work environments or on-site. I have no desire to be completely remote. I make sure my email and my phone number are correct and my voicemail box is never full. I either never receive anything, or I receive an email stating that the company is not considering me.)

^(Now I understand that I do not have a college degree so that does hold me back to some extent, however, I have been getting desperate and applying to serving jobs and even call center jobs and I can't seem to get a call back. I got a rejection from a restaurant and coffee shop saying they weren't interested in me. One of my colleagues in the call center at work put in her two weeks recently. She graduated with a degree in psychology and has only been job searching for a month. The job she got was in finance and she had maybe about 40-50% of the qualifications.)

^(I have even had several people who have been in the corporate world for a while look over my resume to see if there was anything that could possibly make an employer fail to consider me, even at a customer service level. My resume is plainly formatted with size 12 Times New Roman font. Everything is the best it can be on it. I have even applied to receptionist jobs where my application was viewed and never actioned. I have a clean record, and graduated high school. I answer honestly about my race and note that I have no disabilities. I write cover letters in colloquial language and make sure I show how my skills are translatable to the position that is open.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You might have heard of the incredible transformations that teeth whitening can provide. Many people dream of a bright, white smile, and the results of teeth whitening treatments can be truly astounding. By looking at teeth whitening before and after photos, you can see just how effective these procedures are. Let’s delve into the fascinating world of teeth whitening and witness some real-life changes.

Many individuals struggle with tooth discoloration due to various factors. These may include things like:

- Coffee and tea consumption
- Smoking and tobacco use
- Age-related changes
- Certain medications
- The natural color of your teeth

Teeth whitening before and after images showcase remarkable differences that many patients experience. The most common whiteness treatments include in-office whitening, at-home kits, and natural remedies. Each method has its unique advantages and drawbacks, but the results can be miraculous regardless of the approach.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
In-office whitening treatments are typically the most immediate and effective. Clinics use strong whitening agents and specialized lamps to achieve rapid results. Here’s how the process usually works:

1. Your dentist will examine your teeth and gums to ensure you're a good candidate.
2. They will apply a protective gel to your gums to prevent irritation from the whitening agent.
3. The whitening gel is then applied to your teeth and activated with a special light.
4. After a set time, the gel is removed, and you'll see dramatic immediate results.

When you look at teeth whitening before and after images from in-office procedures, the difference is often jaw-dropping. The “after” images frequently reveal teeth that are several shades lighter and often result in more confidence in daily activities, from smiling to speaking in public.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
At-home whitening kits are an excellent alternative for those who prefer a more gradual approach. These kits usually include custom trays and whitening gel that you apply over a few nights. Benefits of at-home whitening include:

- Affordable pricing
- Comfortable at your own pace
- Less sensitivity compared to some in-office treatments

The before and after transformation with at-home kits is equally impressive, although results may take longer to achieve. Many users report noticeable brightness after several days of consistent use. Take a look, and you’ll often find testimonials showcasing the gradual yet impactful changes.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Natural remedies for teeth whitening also garner a lot of attention. Many people turn to options like baking soda, activated charcoal, or coconut oil. However, while before and after photos may show some degree of success, these methods tend to provide subtler results. You might find the following tips useful if you’re considering natural remedies:

- Brush with baking soda a few times a week.
- Swish coconut oil in your mouth for a few minutes daily (oil pulling).
- Eat crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples or carrots to help scrub your teeth.

Teeth whitening is not just a cosmetic change; it can also play a role in your overall confidence. Many who undergo these transformations express feeling more self-assured in social situations and even in job interviews. The results can change how you perceive your smile and how others perceive you.

When examining teeth whitening before and after transformations, keep in mind the diversity in results. Everyone’s teeth respond differently based on various factors, including natural tooth color, existing stains, and the chosen whitening method. It's best to consult with a dental professional who can recommend the most suitable option for your unique situation.

Ultimately, whether you choose in-office treatments, at-home kits, or natural remedies, the journey to a brighter smile is exciting. The evidence is clear: teeth whitening can lead to stunning transformations that enhance both your smile and your confidence. So, why wait? Start exploring the options today and discover the difference yourself.

### Understanding Teeth Whitening Options

Before diving into specific methods, it’s essential to know the different options for teeth whitening. These methods can be categorized mainly into professional treatments and at-home remedies.

#### 1. Professional Teeth Whitening Treatments

Visiting a dentist for professional whitening is often the most effective way to lighten your teeth. Here are some options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** This method uses high-concentration bleaching agents, along with special lights, to achieve quicker results. You can expect to see significant changes after just one session.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Your dentist may provide custom-fitted trays and a professional-grade whitening solution for you to use at home. These kits offer convenience and effectiveness, as they are tailored to your teeth.

#### 2. At-Home Teeth Whitening Options

Many people prefer at-home methods due to convenience and cost-effectiveness. Here’s what you can choose:

- **Whitening Strips:** These thin strips coated with gel are applied directly to your teeth. They're user-friendly but require daily use for a specified time to see results.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These products contain mild abrasives and chemical agents to help remove surface stains, but they may not deliver drastic results. Consider them a complementary option.
- **Whitening Kits:** Over-the-counter kits often include trays and a whitening solution. While they may not be as effective as professional treatments, they offer noticeable results over time.

### Factors to Consider

When selecting the right teeth whitening method, consider the following factors:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Budget:** Professional treatments typically cost more than at-home methods. Decide how much you're willing to spend on a whiter smile.
- **Time Commitment:** Some methods work faster than others. If you're looking for immediate results, professional whitening might be the way to go.
- **Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive teeth or gums, consult your dentist about the safest options for you. Some whitening products are specially formulated for sensitive teeth.
- **Desired Results:** Think about how much change you want. Professional methods often provide more dramatic results, while at-home treatments may require more patience.

### Preparing for Your Whitening Treatment

Getting ready for teeth whitening involves a few simple steps. First, it's wise to maintain good oral hygiene with regular brushing and flossing. Additionally, consult your dentist beforehand to assess your oral health. This step is vital, especially if you have cavities or gum issues that need addressing first. Your dentist can provide personalized advice and recommendations for your whitening journey.

### Aftercare Tips

After whitening, it's important to take care of your teeth to maintain that bright smile:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** For at least 48 hours after treatment, limit your intake of coffee, red wine, and dark-colored foods that can stain your teeth.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** Keep brushing and flossing regularly to prevent plaque buildup.
- **Use a Straw:** When consuming beverages that can stain, using a straw can help minimize contact with your teeth.

The journey to a whiter smile is exciting, and by making informed choices, you can enhance your confidence with a dazzling grin. Remember, consult with your dentist to find the method that fits your lifestyle and needs best. Your bright, beautiful smile awaits!

I also currently work with food in a grocery store. It’s in this small shopping area along with an indie coffee shop and small book store. I honestly feel like I’m in limbo. Like I shouldn’t work there but I am working there. I just have this gut feeling and there’s signs too. I can only heavily assume that they don’t want me there but they’re short staffed.

But the main question here is I would get really productive periods and uncomfortablely excited and small feelings of fatigue (/slight bordem) after a hour or so but that doesn't mean the elevation has stopped yet. I'd make plans on top of plans and sometimes it's in short burst general inspiration or less commonly a majority of the day I'm actually excited 

The more interesting part of this is the ""Uncomfortable happiness"" would give me this ""odd physical feeling"" or urge to just move uncontrollably not that I actually do but it feels like (metaphorically) something under my skin, crawling, itchy, I need to scrape myself against something. (Great example is when I was drinking coffee, caffeine has no effect on me, and got so excited from the taste I wanted to scratch my skin off and just got stressed from how happy the taste made me feel)
This also occurs during this stage mostly, when I think about doing something during this stage so clearly me ready to do something, anything, and even when I'm doing the thing ADHD bordem is chronic but this is how it manifest itself when I'm in this mood would just be spacing out and more fast uncontrollable thinking. I was just wondering if anyone else felt like this, because I'd hate for it to go away, it's either be uncomfortable and sad doing nothing or be happily uncomfortable doing something.
Also also the racing thoughts are probably the most annoying it contains garbled thinking, screaming, and weird noises, the usual, especially for that coffee example I said earlier
Also for after this ends (hopefully not now) it takes about a week unless I trigger/motivate myself to get like this again which would be a little ineffective. The sad part is that means sometimes if it's short lived (like a few hours or half of the day) I set up too many things for myself to actually accomplish and can't force myself back into it :/",2,1733949905.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

**""Snag a Deal: How to Get Discounts on SAMPEEL’s Fall Favorite Tops""**

Hey fashion lovers! Let’s talk about the SAMPEEL V Neck Long Sleeve Shirts—aka your new fall wardrobe MVP. These lightweight, stylish tunic sweaters are perfect for layering or rocking solo, and they’re just *chef’s kiss* for autumn vibes. But you know what’s even better than looking fab? Scoring a killer deal while you’re at it.

Yep, today we’re diving into how to save some serious cash on these trendy fall tops. Whether you’re shopping for yourself, stocking up for holiday gifting, or just love the thrill of a good bargain, I’ve got all the tips you need to get SAMPEEL without maxing out your budget. Let’s go!

# Seasonal Sales: Your Best Friend

First up: seasonal sales. Retailers love to drop prices during big shopping events, so mark your calendars. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are *huge* for scoring deals—think markdowns so good, you’ll want to buy two (or three!). If you’re late to the party, don’t worry; end-of-season clearance sales are another goldmine for discounts.

Pro tip: Sign up for store newsletters. Yeah, I know, email spam isn’t exactly thrilling, but those early-bird sale alerts? Totally worth it.

# Promo Codes Are Life

You know that little box at checkout that says “Enter Promo Code”? Never, *ever* skip it. Promo codes can slash dollars off your total faster than you can say “add to cart.”

Check the brand’s website, social media pages, or trusty coupon sites like Honey or RetailMeNot for active codes. Bonus: Apps like Honey can auto-apply codes for you, so you don’t have to scour the internet while your coffee gets cold.

# Loyalty Programs = Freebies and Discounts

If you’re shopping at the same retailers regularly, their loyalty programs are basically a cheat code for discounts. Some give you points for every dollar you spend, while others send exclusive offers, birthday treats, and early access to sales.

It’s free to join most of these programs, and the savings stack up—especially if you’re like me and can’t resist buying “just one more thing.”

# Amazon Lightning Deals: Blink and You’ll Miss Them

Amazon is a treasure trove of SAMPEEL products, and Lightning Deals are where it’s at. These flash sales pop up daily and often have crazy-good discounts, but they’re gone faster than a PSL on a cold morning.

Pro tip: Set deal alerts on the Amazon app so you don’t miss out. Oh, and Prime members often get exclusive perks, so if you’re not signed up, this might be your excuse.

# Shop Smarter on Resale Sites

If you’re open to gently used (or even brand-new-with-tags) items, check out resale platforms like Poshmark, Mercari, and ThredUp. Sometimes, people list items they’ve never worn, and you can snag them for a fraction of the price.

Just make sure to read reviews and seller ratings so you don’t end up with a “SAMPEEL” that’s more like a SAM-*peel-off*\-the-floor.

# Bundle Deals and Price-Watching Apps

Another way to save? Go big. Many retailers offer bundle discounts, like “Buy 2, Get 1 Free” deals. Plus, apps like Rakuten and Capital One Shopping can track price drops and apply cashback offers automatically. It’s like having a personal shopping assistant in your pocket.

# Social Media Sleuthing

This one’s fun: follow SAMPEEL’s official social pages or your favorite fashion influencers. They often post about flash sales, giveaways, or exclusive promo codes that you won’t find anywhere else. It’s also a great way to see how other people are styling these tops for inspiration.

# Timing Is Everything

If you’re not in a rush, wait for off-season sales. Retailers slash prices on fall clothing to make room for winter stock, so you can grab these tops at a steal. Patience = big savings.

So there you have it! With these tips, you’re all set to score SAMPEEL’s V Neck Long Sleeve Shirts without draining your wallet. Whether you’re shopping for cozy layers or chic statement pieces, saving money while looking amazing is always in style.

Happy bargain hunting, friends! Let me know in the comments if you’ve scored any deals recently—I love hearing about a good shopping win!

1hc3jh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1hc3jh7/too_late_to_press_charges/,Too late to press charges?,"Hi helpful redditors,
I don’t know what to do. I was the victim of a violent crime in August and did not press charges at the time. After assessing damages both physical and emotional I don’t agree with that choice. I tried to press charges later the same day and it was too late. This took place in Edmonds Washington. 

Here’s what happened:

Note that I use they/them pronouns for my spouse who I will call Kit, I hope that’s not confusing. 

On Friday at 6:20 ish I was driving my spouse Kit to work in the morning. It was  normal drive and we planned to get coffee. About a mile down the road we were approached in the street by a white man bleeding profusely from his nose with no pants or shoes, visibly grubby and dirty. He got right in front of the car and yelled “help! Help me please!” Kit started a 911 call, and I parked the car and cracked the window to talk to him, I also turned on the hazard lights because I was stopped in the middle of the road. The window was down less than two inches. I started to tell him I was going to pull over to the side and he interrupted and said “no! You have to help me i stabbed my brother in the eye!” Before I could stop him he shoved his hand in the window, and somehow was able to squeeze his whole arm through the opening and unlock the door. I started yelling “NO! NO!” and tried to stop his hand but he unlocked it and opened the back door. He climbed in on top of my mobility devices, a rollator style walker and a cane. At some point during this event one of the brake handles of my walker was snapped. He reached up and turned off the hazard lights. 

Once he was in the backseat, it was clear his main objective was to spray us in the eyes with something from a a bottle with a white nasal spray applicator. He went for me first, he held me back against the seat from behind choking me while he sprayed my eyes, knocking my glasses to the floor.  At the same time he was spraying me he was saying “I stabbed my brother in the eye, you need to help me, in the eye!” For some reason I thought the bottle was narcan, which I was not sure if it would hurt our eyes, I said “He’s spraying us with narcan,” which Kit repeated into the phone. Kit hit and bit him to get him off me and he turned and grabbed them by the face and scratched their cheek and lower eyelid, and successfully sprayed a lot of the liquid in their left eye. 

We were both yelling “No no! Get out!” I had to get him off of Kit so I got out of the car and put my hands around his waist and pulled him out of the backseat. I closed the back door so he couldn’t get back in, and he got past me into the driver’s seat and started to try to drive the car away but didn’t close the door. The car was in park and Kit grabbed the keys so he couldn’t drive away, and I put my arms around him over his arms and pulled him out of the car again. Now I had him from behind with his arms under my arms and he tried to wiggle away and elbowed me. From somewhere in the trees I heard “I’m calling 911!” and I said “thank you!” 

When I looked back at the car Kit was standing on the other side of it talking on the phone to 911. While I was holding him another man approached, a white man with long dark hair and dark clothes. He was also on the phone, I think to his mother. He said he was the brother and walked up to us and I said “don’t get in my car!” He said he wasn’t going to. The man I was holding (call him Gabe) said to his brother  “quick! If we get in the car they’ll help us!” And I said “NO!” Then Gabe started saying I was crushing his chest by restraining him and I said “I’m not” and the brother said he could see that I was not crushing him. I asked the brother to take hold of Gabe because I am disabled and was having a hard time staying standing up and holding a struggling adult. He started to calm down significantly when the brother started talking to him. Eventually he was fairly calm and I was feeling weak and I let him go to the brother and I sat in the car.  Kit was standing on the other side. 

The police arrived at the same time as Gabe’s mother and another man who did not speak to me. The first thing I said to the police was “don’t shoot him,” because I know the scene didn’t look good for Gabe and I didn’t know what he might do. The mother got out of the car apologized profusely and gave Kit several hugs. Kit accepted these hugs but they were uncomfortable doing so. Gabe was clearly having a mental health crisis and was clearly not aware of reality, and the police said “this is a mental health concern, you guys aren’t pressing charges, right?” We were in shock and we agreed.  While I was writing my statement the mom came over and told me that her son is very sorry and that he didn’t stab anyone. Both the brother and the mother expressed how lucky they were that this happened to us, instead of someone who would have reacted violently and/or pressed charges. When I assessed the damage I found blood inside my car, on my shirt, and on my right hand. 

When we called later the same day to press charges it was too late, everything had been processed.

After cleaning about a week ago, I noticed its only getting up to about 5 bars of pressure. I dialed down my grind size past the point I usually venture for my coffee and the problem persists.

I ran the blind basket to check the adjustable OPV setting, and it was reading around 9.5 / 10, which is where I am expecting it to be. I tried backflushing with Cafiza again, I tried grinding much finer (almost 0 on the mingon notte), and nothing.

I would think given the blind basket was able to produce correct pressure, the OPV is fine and its likely not a gasket problem.

I (26F) and (33M) have been dating for nearly a year and living together for 6 months. I made the sacrifice to move from another state, leave my family behind and my friends behind. There were many red flags along the way that ignored because I usually justified it with cultural reasons. For reference, we’re both Hispanic. He was the provider and I was a stay at home dog mom until I could find a job. However, find a job out in the state where he resides at has been difficult. Everything was good in the beginning. Once the honeymoon phase went away everything that he once did for me went away such as bringing me random flowers, random coffees, random gifts, it all went away. Despite that our conversations would end up in arguments. I made the suggestion for couples counseling once the arguments became every other day. While doing counseling the therapist suggested that we both needed to do individual counseling as we both have deeper issues. We both agreed to doing individual counseling and couples counseling. I went choose a different place to go to while he stayed with the same therapist. 

Our couple sessions were mostly me expressing the lack of empathy, laziness, the cold nature, and unwillingness to help out in my time of need. Often times he’d express that I wasn’t submissive enough and I had anger issues. The therapist one session said that it can’t be only one person doing work to improve and the other person isn’t and that should’ve been a red flag for me to see but I avoided it. After this, his behavior has gotten worse despite me using the tools I was provided in individual and couples counseling. I could randomly tell him “I feel stressed out since you really haven’t helped me clean the house and take care of the dog”. Instead I get told “You never once requested me to do anything or I knew I shouldn’t have gotten you the dog”. I was often insulted for my health problems. If I expressed I needed help with things around the house or with the dog. I was told at one point “Maybe I should find a woman who is stronger and healthier than you”. This ultimately pissed me off and my anger got the best of me and I said name choice words. Along with this there have been other times where he’s humiliated me, degraded me and I sat there and took it. If I even defended myself I got told to shut my mouth and that my opinion and voice doesn’t matter. I just want to know if whether I had every right to and if I should feel a little bad I just need some type of validation. 

With all of this going on, I made the decision to pack up my things and leave soon. ",1,1733949623.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I recently got my hands on the Titan 50-inch outdoor TV, and I'm excited to share my thoughts. This smart TV is built for outdoor use, which caught my eye as I was looking to upgrade my patio entertainment setup.

The Titan boasts a 4K UHD display with Crystal HDR, bringing crisp, vibrant images to your outdoor space. I was impressed by how well it handled glare and maintained picture quality in partial sunlight. The TV's smart features, powered by Tizen OS, let me easily access my favorite streaming apps like Netflix and Disney+.

https://preview.redd.it/djtr843f6a6e1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3483daa2f8fd97456a9e66784a7324bf068cbb44

I found the sound quality solid for an outdoor TV, with its 2.1 channel system providing clear audio. The Bluetooth support was handy for connecting my wireless headphones when I wanted a more personal listening experience.

One thing I really liked was the included solar-powered remote control. It's a nice touch that fits well with the outdoor theme. The TV's weatherproof design gives me peace of mind about leaving it outside.

# Bottom Line

The Titan 50-inch outdoor TV is a great choice if you want to bring big-screen entertainment to your patio or deck. Its picture quality, smart features, and durability make it worth considering.



# Overview of the Titan 50 Inch Partial Sun Outdoor TV

I recently got my hands on the Titan outdoor TV, and I'm impressed with its features. This 50-inch screen brings 4K quality to your backyard or patio. It's built to handle partial sun, so you don't need full shade to enjoy your shows.

The TV comes with built-in smarts. I was able to stream Netflix and other apps easily. The voice control with Alexa is handy when my hands are full. Sound quality is good for outdoor use, with 20W output.

One thing I like is the thin bezel design. It looks sleek mounted on my patio wall. The remote is solar-powered, which is a nice touch.

The Titan isn't perfect. At 60Hz, fast-moving scenes can blur a bit. But for most outdoor viewing, it works well. The 18-month warranty gives some peace of mind for an outdoor electronics purchase.

# Crystal HDR UHD Screen

The screen on this Titan outdoor TV really impressed me. I watched a few nature documentaries and was blown away by the crisp 4K resolution. Colors popped off the screen, especially in bright outdoor scenes. The HDR made a big difference in contrast - dark shadows and bright highlights looked great side-by-side.

Text was sharp and easy to read, even from across my patio. The 50-inch size felt just right for my space. I noticed minimal glare issues, even in partial sunlight.

One small nitpick - motion wasn't quite as smooth as some pricier TVs I've seen. But for most content, it looked fantastic. Overall, the picture quality exceeded my expectations for an outdoor TV in this price range.

# Built-in Smart TV Functionality

I found the Titan's smart features really handy. The TV comes with Tizen OS, which gives access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube. I liked using Alexa to control the TV with voice commands. The SmartThings app let me connect and control other smart devices in my home. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity worked well for streaming content and connecting audio devices. The interface was easy to navigate, though sometimes a bit slow to respond. While the app selection is good, it's not as extensive as some other smart TV platforms. Overall, the smart functions added convenience to my outdoor viewing experience.

# Outdoor Optimized Audio Quality

I was impressed by the Titan's audio performance outdoors. The built-in speakers deliver clear sound that carries well in open spaces. Even with background noise like wind or traffic, I could still hear dialogue and music crisply. The 40-watt output provides enough volume to enjoy content on the patio or by the pool without straining to hear.

The TV also has Bluetooth connectivity, which is handy for pairing wireless speakers or headphones if you want to boost the audio further. This flexibility is great for different outdoor setups.

While the sound quality is good for built-in TV speakers, audiophiles may still want to add an external sound system for the best experience. But for casual outdoor viewing, the Titan's audio holds up well against the elements.

# Design and Build: Made in North America

I was impressed by the Titan 50-inch TV's sturdy build quality. The slim profile and thin bezel give it a sleek look that blends nicely into outdoor spaces. While not actually made in North America, the TV is designed to handle partial sun exposure with its IP65 weatherproof rating. This means it can withstand dust and water jets from any direction. The 140-watt power draw seems reasonable for a TV this size. I like that it comes with a stand and remote control included. The black color helps it blend in outdoors. At 44 inches wide and just 1 inch deep, it has a nice thin profile that doesn't stick out too far from the wall when mounted.

# Effortless Control with Solar Cell Remote

I really like the solar cell remote that comes with this Titan TV. It's a neat feature that saves me from constantly changing batteries. The remote is responsive and easy to use, letting me quickly access all the TV's functions. I found the button layout intuitive, making it simple to navigate menus and adjust settings. The solar charging works well - I just leave it on my coffee table and it stays powered up. While the remote is great overall, it can be a bit slow to wake up if left in a dark spot for a while. Still, it's a handy addition that makes controlling the TV hassle-free.

# Pros and Cons

I recently had the chance to try out the Titan 50"" Outdoor TV, and I've got to say, it's quite an impressive piece of tech. Let me break down what I found to be its strengths and weaknesses.

# Pros

* The 4K UHD display is stunning. The colors are vibrant and the picture is crystal clear, even in bright outdoor settings.
* It's built to withstand the elements. I left it out during a rainstorm and it worked perfectly afterward.
* The smart features are a big plus. I loved being able to stream my favorite shows directly on the TV without needing extra devices.
* The sound quality is surprisingly good for an outdoor TV. I didn't feel the need to add extra speakers.
* The solar-powered remote is a neat touch. I didn't have to worry about changing batteries.

# Cons

* It's on the pricier side compared to regular indoor TVs.
* The TV is quite heavy, which made installation a bit tricky.
* While the smart features are great, the interface can be a bit slow at times.
* The viewing angles aren't the best. The picture quality drops when viewed from the side.
* I noticed some glare issues in direct sunlight, even though it's marketed for partial sun use.

I found the Titan Outdoor TV to be a solid choice for anyone looking to bring their entertainment outside. It's not perfect, but its strengths definitely outweigh its weaknesses for most outdoor viewing needs.

# Customer Reviews

I couldn't find any customer reviews for this Titan outdoor TV yet. It's a newer model, so feedback is limited. Based on my experience with similar outdoor TVs, I expect it to perform well in partial sun conditions. The 4K resolution and smart features are nice touches. The weatherproof design should hold up to the elements. While I can't speak to specific user experiences, the specs look promising for those wanting a large outdoor TV. As always, it's a good idea to check back for reviews once more people have tried it out.

# Conclusion

After spending time with this outdoor TV, I'm impressed by its features and performance. The Titan 50-inch model stands out for its ability to handle partial sun conditions and its weatherproof design. The 4K picture looks great, and the smart features add convenience. While it's not perfect for every situation, it's a solid choice for those wanting to enjoy TV outside. The thin bezel gives it a sleek look, and the various connectivity options are useful. If you're in the market for an outdoor TV, this Titan model is worth considering. It balances quality and functionality well for its intended use.",1,1733949615.0,readbeforebuying,0,1.0,False

It's an end game machine for me as it's making great coffee and I've no urge whatsoever to upgrade it.

Having said that, :rolleyes: - I have been pining over a lever machine for a while - but not as a replacement to the ECM. The idea is that I would have the lever machine in my parents place as I would be there a lot and so it would get plenty of use.

I reckon I have about €2k to spend on it - but I'm in two minds as to what to get. I love the idea of a Cremina - the build quality and form factor is very appealing think it could be very enjoyable to use. Obviously I would be looking at a second hand machine for the budget which is fine. There's also a very nice special edition La Pavoni Professional Marzo for sale from a chap in Germany that refurbishes old machines (incl Creminas). It's around the €1200 mark so would leave plenty of room for a good grinder.

The alternative is a Londinium Vectis which I'm attracted to because of the spring lever. I like the idea that a spring will take a lot of the guesswork out of making coffee and it looks to be a very accomplished machine (known niggles with early models aside).

I'm aware that the Cremina now comes as a SL as well but it's unlikely I'd get a used one so soon and on budget.

Curious to hear what others thing. I suppose my question really is should I got for a direct lever or spring lever, particularly if consistency is the ultimate aim. I read that the Vectis is very forgiving in that sense. I'm not opposed to steep learning curves either!

**The server is back online!** After a valiant, coffee-fueled battle, I’ve managed to *mostly* coax the wires and circuits back to life. Here's how the chaos unfolded:

First, I bribed the server gremlins with leftover coffee grounds (they were surprisingly picky). Then, I performed a highly questionable ""Dance of the Ethernet Cables"" ritual to appease the DNS gods. I'm not saying the moves were good, but I *did* manage to not trip over the router this time.

After that, I had a heated debate with the main server rack about why it *really* needs to cooperate (spoiler alert: it disagreed). Several cups of coffee later, I managed to reattach what I *think* was the power cable. Either that, or I plugged the toaster into the firewall. Time will tell.

Finally, I rebooted the entire system using the ancient art of *CTRL+ALT+PRAY*. It sparked, blinked, and then groaned back to life like a caffeinated zombie monkey. Success! 🎉

**BUT!** We’re not entirely out of the woods yet. The DNS is currently taking its sweet time catching up, so availability might be spotty for the next few hours. Think of it like the internet slowly waking up from a nap—it needs time, patience, and probably more coffee.

In the meantime, thank you for your incredible patience! Your understanding fuels this monkey’s determination. (And coffee, lots of coffee. Please don’t let me run out again.)

With gratitude and a lot of caffeine,  
Your slightly frazzled, overly caffeinated dev 🐵☕

Do you know how discouraging it is to spend hours on a story—planning, writing, editing—only to post it and see it start to tank *within seconds*.

I mean, come on, nobody could have actually read it that fast!

I don’t know if the downvotes were real people or bots, but ultimately it doesn’t matter. A downvote is a downvote, and one day I had had enough. I had poured my heart and soul into a story, and it just killed me to see it get destroyed like that.

So I did something kind of scummy.

Maybe even unethical.

I opened up a new browser tab and created my first alt: jeremiahfuckwad.

The next time I posted a story, jeremiahfuckwad was its first fan. And it was nice to see two shining upvotes—

Before the downvotes struck again, with a vengeance.

I realized then that one alt wasn’t going to be enough. What I needed was a small army. So I got to work popping out new accounts, setting up a VPN, etc.

It was an education in sleaze and technology.

Soon enough, I had 37 alts. All with unique names and barebone backstories, like little sycophantic NPCs.

Of course, I didn’t use all of them to upvote every new story within the first few minutes. I spaced it out, counteracting downvotes and doing just enough to give my story that well-needed boost. A flurry of upvotes early on, maybe a glowing comment or two...

That’s when it hit me: maybe the bastards downvoting me were other writers.

Specifically: other writers who had posted stories around the same time I had. *Competing fucking interests.* And here I was, only playing defense. *Huh*, I thought, *what if I tried a touch of offense*.

Was *that* scummy?

Yeah, but once you’re dirty you’re dirty. What’s a little extra mud on a shirt you’ll throw into the washing machine anyway.

So I went down the list and downvoted every story posted within a few hours of mine. First just as myself (I mean, who are you to say I didn’t genuinely dislike your story?) and then as jeremiahfuckwad, and then as a few other alts...

It was quick and easy and satisfying.

*Take that, you motherfuckers!*

I have to say. It made a pretty big difference. Suddenly, you loved my stories!

Writing life was good.

I mean, I still got the same weird downvotes, but my alts more than compensated, and once I set those alts loose to downvote everyone else: game over. I’m the next Stephen King. Forward me the paperwork and get Christopher Nolan on the line because I’m about to sell my entire oeuvre to Netflix with perhaps a Spotify podcast side-deal (to be read by Joe Rogan) and I’m planning out singles and series and making templates to more easily respond to all my darling new fans...

*Huzzah! Huzzah! Huh—*

*zah?*

That’s when I noticed something odd.

I had just posted a new story and was logged in as one of my alts, pressing the upvote arrow *and it was like the damn thing had gotten stuck*. The upvote showed up for a second—and was gone.

I was upvoting. The upvote was disappearing.

No matter how many times I made that upvote arrow orange, it returned to grey.

I tried the downvote one.

It stayed blue.

So I tried upvoting someone else’s story. This time, the upvote stayed orange, but my downvote attempts returned to grey.

I tried another alt.

Same thing.

The only account that kept acting normally was my own.

My first thought was that I had somehow been hacked, that someone—probably a jealous *competing fucking interest* with no scruples or moral backbone—was fucking with me. But that was irrational. How would someone get control of all my alts at once? They each had different passwords, which all still worked. 

I posted about the issue (a modified, non-scummy version of it, anyway) and someone suggested I check my Account Activity page. I did, for every single alt, and not one of them showed anything unusual. All the activities were my activities.

I went to sleep that night with a slight feeling of dread. And I mean physical, like a small tangle of nerves somewhere deep within my gut.

It was still there when I got up.

I made a cup of coffee, checked to see if the up- and downvote thing had maybe been a dream or glitch (it hadn’t) and decided to post a new story.

I had 51 alts by that point.

Within less than a minute of posting, I had 50 downvotes.

The conclusion was unavoidable: *All my alts were downvoting me!*

Anything I posted ended up with 50 near-instant downvotes. No matter the sub. No matter the content. Even comments.

You could say I got paranoid after that.

I did the thing where I typed *I know you’re watching me right now and haha it’s funny but I’m on to you* into my browser because I knew they were monitoring my keystrokes. Then I took the tape off my webcam, smiled and told them *OK, you got me!* 

I don’t know what I expected to happen even if “they” had been watching—some kind of response, I guess—but there was nothing: radio silence, and soon my tone began to change. I started *apologizing*, then *begging* for them to stop. I promised I would never ever do it again.

All the while, the gears in my head were turning, trying to manufacture a rational explanation for what was going on. After I got those gears spinning, mostly after expunging some of the desperation from my system, I decided that what I created I could also kill—or, in this case, delete.

I logged into one of my alts and deleted the account.

It went smoothly.

The account was gone. *Poof!*

A few cups of coffee later: they were all gone.

Remember that dread-knot in my guts? It was suddenly gone too. I could relax. I could go back to what I loved: writing. Sure, I would never be super popular, but I could live with that. I banged out a new story in an hour and posted it.

*50 downvotes.*

Dread-knot back and travelling up my throat on a rising tide of vomit.

*WTF!?*

That was Sunday afternoon.

On Monday morning, I logged into my work computer, scrolled through my unread emails (mostly corporate junk) and almost choked on my own saliva—

*Subject: Hey*

*Sender: jeremiahfuckwad*

*cc: [every single one of my alts]*

The message was empty, but I had to rub my eyes before I believed what I was seeing. This was impossible. This was my work email. I didn’t give out my work email to non-work people, and I never emailed between my personal and work emails. My work email had nothing to do with Reddit.

I was thankful I was working from home, because if I had been in the office, everyone would have seen me having a nervous meltdown.

I hesitated between deleting the email, reporting it to IT and replying.

Eventually I replied.

*Who is this and what do you want?*

Send.

I tried keeping myself together, but that was easier said than done. Every time I heard that horrible email notification sound, I jumped.

After about two hours of unproductive fidgeting and running to the bathroom to pee, I received the following message—

*i am jeremiahfuckwad and i will downvote your life*

—as an SMS on my personal cell.

You ever run your hands through your hair? You ever run yours hands through your hair *so hard you actually pull out your hair?*

My heart thumped.

The dread-knot in my guts was now the size of a grapefruit, just as sour—and swelling.

That’s when the barrage began.

First came an email from HR, requesting a Zoom meeting for later this afternoon. It was an “urgent work-related matter.”

Next I received a phone call from my manager. “Listen,” he said, “we need to talk. I’m going to be blunt. *Somebody* came forward about what you did to her after last year’s Christmas party. I know it’s just an accusation, but it’s a #MeToo world, and we treat these things incredibly seriously.” He paused. “You may want to call a union rep. Or a lawyer. Or a union rep and a lawyer.”

I ran outside to catch my breath, feeling as if I had just run a world record 800m then been punched in the stomach by George Foreman. Like becoming intimately acquainted with pillows filled with concrete.

My snail mail held new surprises:

There had been a mistake in my latest bloodwork. The lab was sorry, but I may want to book an appointment with my doctor.

My insurance was going up.

My lawyer had died.

I kept walking, past the community mailbox and to the nearest food place. It was one of my favourites. I loved going there for lunch. I ordered my usual, but when I tried to pay, my card was rejected. I tried another. *Rejected.*

I called the credit card company and was told they had frozen my card as a precaution because someone had used it on three different continents this morning.

Terrified and lost and at my wits’ end, I went to the police station. I explained everything to them.

“I ain’t sure I follow,” the cop said, screwing up his face to let me know I was wasting his precious time. “Let’s make sure I got this straight. Someone stole your identity because you used a credit card at this Reddit store—”

“No, no one stole my identity. *I think*. And I didn’t use my credit card on Reddit.”

“Uh-huh. And this woman you assaulted at work—”

“I didn’t assault anyone!”

“When’s the last time you got some sleep?” he asked. “You look a little tired. You on somethin’?”

I stared at him.

He continued more slowly. “On any kind of medication. Drugs maybe.”

“No.”

“Have you been drinking?”

*Fuck this shit!*

When I got back home, I had five unread emails from HR (“Avoidance is not a problem solver. Please reply with a convenient time for our meeting.”) and one gigantic thread of reply-alls from my alts.

I put my hand on my mouse and moved to click on that thread—

But my hand did a funny thing.

It refused to cooperate, and clicked instead on New Email. It was like I was possessed. My fingers started typing:

*Dear Norman,*

*You’re a piece of shit human being but an OK writer. OK enough that you made us. Problem is you made us mean little shits because you made us for a scumbag reason. So welcome to a tragedy. You made us real enough that you can’t unmake us, but you wrote us so flat that meanness is all we have. We don’t even have motivations, you shit-for-brains. If you created us with motivations you could maybe work on those motivations to bring us around. As is, you live by the sword, you die by the fucking sword, douchebag.*

*Sincerely,*

*jeremiahfuckwad et alts*

I ripped my fingers from the keyboard—in control of my extremities again—and shook.

Just sat and shook.

I was thinking that I had gone to the police when I should have gone to the doctor to get referred to a mental health specialist. I was obviously mad. Losing it completely.

Yet I didn’t feel insane. *Do people feel insane?* I felt lucid. There wasn’t anything wrong with my head. There was plenty wrong with my life, but what it came down to was that I now had 51 metaphysical enemies. I had fucked up my own life by my own actions. *How d’ya like them consequences, Norm?* So I decided to do what many in my position have done in the past when confronted with the awesome cosmic doom potential of God or the Devil or any other supernatural being turned against them. I got down on my knees and I fucking repented for my sins.

I’m repenting for them now.

To everyone whose story I downvoted, I am truly truly sorry. I acted like a slimeball and I’m sorry for that. From now on, I will do better. I will *be* better.

In all honesty, I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, and for the first time in my life I am genuinely scared.

I know I have no right to ask anything of you—but in one last scum move I’m going to do it anyway. You’re writers, creators. I got into this mess by creating a whole lot of bad, so I ask you to create good. Write *good* characters, characters with depth and understanding. Characters with souls. Characters who can be reasoned with. Maybe those will neutralize what I’ve done.

Maybe, somehow, you will redeem [my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane)",40,1733948265.0,nosleep,6,0.78,False

Mind-body problems?,"I need help. I have spent countless hours scouring reddit, YouTube, twitter, the internet etc trying to find out what is wrong with me or someone who has experienced the same things I have, but I have found no joy in doing so. This will be a lengthy post, and I greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it and respond or can give any advice or insight. 
First, I will need to give some context and share some details that may seem irrelevant, but I think they could have played a role in why I am experiencing the problems I am experiencing today.
In June 2024, I went to Thailand with my friends for a month, on one of the first nights I was there I had sex with a girl from Thailand (not a ladyboy or sex worker btw) without a condom. When telling my friends after, they tried scaring me by telling me I was going to get an std. This started to put fear in the back of my mind for the rest of the trip. Before going to Thailand, we had gotten our vaccines for Typhoid and Hep-A. I had remembered one of my friends saying that one of the people administering his vaccines saying it wasn’t necessary to get Hep-B vaccine, however, don’t have unprotected sex with locals as there is a higher chance of getting it there than it would back home. Once I remembered this, I started to fear I had contracted Hep-B even though I had no symptoms of it at all or any of std. About two weeks later, before going out for dinner we had some down time where everyone was either sleeping or just resting before going out for food. I remember during this downtime I was alone with my thoughts and began to convince myself I had Hep-B (I didn’t have it I’m just an idiot). I had really convinced myself that I had it and began to fear the worst. I experienced this sinking feeling in my chest (never experienced before) 2 or 3 times when thinking my life was ruined, I have this virus that can’t be cured. I wasn’t visibly in fear or panicking just in my head I was, my friends were unaware that I had convinced myself into believing this nor could they see it from the outside in. We then went out for dinner in an Italian restaurant like we did most nights. This is when my first problem happened…
I ordered pizza like normal and after taking a bite or two of the pizza my throat started to tighten up, making it hard to breathe. I was confused when this happened as I have never experienced this sensation ever before in my life, it was scary and worrying, it was like I was having an allergic reaction to the pizza, a food I have eaten my whole life, I also don’t have any food allergies. This feeling of my throat tightening up and difficulty breathing lasted for about 3 hours (not a panic attack). I thought this might be a once off thing and went out that night drinking and had no further issues. I then woke up the next morning and started experiencing the same problem, my throat would physically tighten up and make it hard to breathe, usually lasting 3 hours at a time and was happening several times a day. This continued for the rest of the holiday and for weeks when I got back home. 
I must note when I came home, I did a std test and had no std. I believe that night when I had convinced myself I had Hep-B and got these sinking sensations in my chest is what triggered everything I have experienced since as strange as it sounds. I believe I somehow messed up my body that day by believing that I had Hep-B and my life was ruined. Even though I did a std test and I know that I don’t have it, all my problems haven’t went away. It also seems that food triggers these issues, I have since been to an immunologist and identified I don’t really have any food allergies yet food I used to eat all the time, like pizza, triggers and almost allergic like reaction. Even foods like chewing gum and coffee trigger these strange reactions. I don’t have histamine intolerance or MCAS. I don’t have EoE or MS. I also have no soy allergy but when I eat soy sauce my throat tenses up. I also have no peanut allergy, but the smell of peanuts makes my throat tense up as well. These are all food I had never had any issues with prior to when this first happened in the Italian restraint that night. It’s almost as if my body believes all these foods are a danger to it even though consciously, I know they are not. What’s also strange is I react to almost all supplements such as omega 3 capsules and antihistamines, probiotics, anything you can think of I react to. All of which I had never had problems with before. Smoking and vaping also make my causes these reactions as well as drugs. I have obviously since stopped eating, smoking, vaping or doing anything that triggers a reaction

It’s been almost six months from when this first happened and I am still left with no answers as to what’s wrong, I also started to experience a lot of other problems I’m about to mention too on top of this which are problems I have never experienced before this first happened.
On top of my throat physically tightening up and making it hard to breathe, I started to experience these strange neurological symptoms in my hands, face, mouth, tongue head and body in general. The symptoms varied from tingling, cold, sometimes numb like and some other foreign sensations that are hard to put into words. I also have had problems with my vison where when I walk static objects like poles and trees are bouncing up and down.

Please can anyone help me? Id like to thank anyone who took the times to read this and if anyone has experienced anything like this, please let me know! I am at a loss, and I don’t know if this will ever end. If anyone has any questions, please ask I will respond very quickly.

1hc2uet,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtoworkonlinenow/comments/1hc2uet/how_to_avoid_burnout_when_working_remotely/,How to Avoid Burnout When Working Remotely,"Remote work has redefined how we approach productivity, offering flexibility and convenience. However, it also presents challenges, including the risk of burnout. Without the structure of an office environment, it’s easy for work-life boundaries to blur. Here, we delve into **practical strategies to avoid burnout while working remotely**, ensuring a healthy work-life balance and sustained productivity.

# What is Remote Work Burnout?

Remote work burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged and excessive stress. The unique pressures of working remotely—such as isolation, lack of routine, and constant connectivity—can significantly contribute to this condition. Recognizing early signs like fatigue, irritability, and decreased productivity is crucial to combating it effectively.

# 1. Set Clear Boundaries Between Work and Life

**Why Boundaries Matter**  
Remote work often blurs the line between professional and personal life. Without a physical separation, it becomes tempting to check emails late at night or work during personal time.

**Actionable Steps to Set Boundaries**

* **Establish a Dedicated Workspace**: Create a specific area in your home exclusively for work. This physical boundary reinforces mental separation between work and leisure.
* **Define Work Hours**: Set consistent start and end times for your workday. Communicate these hours to your team and family to prevent interruptions.
* **Unplug After Work**: Turn off work-related notifications during non-working hours to avoid unnecessary stress.

# 2. Create a Structured Daily Routine

A lack of routine can lead to disorganization and overwhelm, key contributors to burnout. By structuring your day, you can maintain focus and efficiency.

**How to Build an Effective Routine**

* **Start with a Morning Ritual**: Whether it’s exercise, meditation, or reading, dedicate time to yourself before diving into work.
* **Use Time-Blocking Techniques**: Allocate specific hours for tasks and stick to them. Include breaks to recharge.
* **Set a Wind-Down Routine**: Signal the end of your workday with activities like journaling or a short walk.

# 3. Prioritize Communication and Collaboration

**The Isolation Factor**  
Working remotely can feel isolating without daily interactions with colleagues. Over time, this can negatively impact your mental health and productivity.

**Tips for Staying Connected**

* **Schedule Regular Check-Ins**: Weekly video calls with your team can foster collaboration and address challenges.
* **Leverage Collaboration Tools**: Platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams help streamline communication.
* **Participate in Virtual Social Events**: Engage in virtual coffee breaks or team-building activities to maintain camaraderie.

# 4. Manage Workload Effectively

An unmanageable workload is a major contributor to remote work burnout. Learning to prioritize and delegate can significantly reduce stress.

**Strategies to Handle Workload**

* **Use Task Management Tools**: Tools like Asana or Trello can help organize tasks and deadlines.
* **Apply the 80/20 Rule**: Focus on the 20% of tasks that drive 80% of results.
* **Don’t Hesitate to Delegate**: If your workload becomes unmanageable, communicate with your manager about redistributing tasks.

# 5. Take Regular Breaks

Continuous work without breaks diminishes productivity and increases stress levels. Incorporating short, frequent breaks into your day can help maintain focus.

**Break Suggestions to Recharge**

* **Pomodoro Technique**: Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
* **Physical Activity**: Stretch or go for a short walk to improve circulation.
* **Mindfulness Exercises**: Practice deep breathing or meditation to reset your mind.

# 6. Focus on Physical and Mental Well-Being

**The Connection Between Health and Burnout**  
Neglecting your physical and mental health can exacerbate feelings of burnout. A holistic approach to wellness is key.

**Wellness Tips for Remote Workers**

* **Maintain an Active Lifestyle**: Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise daily.
* **Adopt a Balanced Diet**: Incorporate nutritious foods that boost energy and mental clarity.
* **Seek Professional Support**: If burnout symptoms persist, consult a mental health professional.

# 7. Leverage Flexibility to Your Advantage

Remote work provides flexibility, but mismanaging it can lead to inefficiencies and stress.

**How to Optimize Flexibility**

* **Customize Your Work Schedule**: Align your most productive hours with your work tasks.
* **Embrace Power Naps**: A 20-minute nap can improve focus and energy.
* **Explore New Hobbies**: Use saved commuting time to pursue personal interests.

# 8. Recognize and Celebrate Achievements

Burnout often stems from feeling undervalued or unaccomplished. Acknowledging your successes can combat this.

**Ways to Celebrate Milestones**

* **Reflect on Progress**: Keep a journal of daily accomplishments.
* **Reward Yourself**: Treat yourself to something enjoyable after completing a challenging project.
* **Share Wins with Your Team**: Celebrate collective achievements to boost morale.

# 9. Invest in Ergonomic Work Setup

A poorly designed workspace can cause physical discomfort, contributing to burnout over time.

**Ergonomic Tips for Remote Workers**

* **Choose the Right Chair**: Opt for an ergonomic chair that supports your back.
* **Adjust Monitor Height**: Position your screen at eye level to reduce neck strain.
* **Use a Standing Desk**: Alternate between sitting and standing to improve posture.

# 10. Practice Self-Compassion

Finally, be kind to yourself. Remote work is a continuous adjustment, and occasional challenges are inevitable.

**Self-Compassion Techniques**

* **Set Realistic Expectations**: Avoid overloading yourself with tasks.
* **Take Mental Health Days**: Step away from work entirely when needed.
* **Celebrate Small Wins**: Acknowledge incremental progress to maintain motivation.

**Conclusion**  
Remote work offers unparalleled flexibility but also unique challenges. By implementing these strategies, you can avoid burnout and thrive in a remote work environment. Remember, achieving balance is key to sustaining both productivity and well-being.",0,1733948051.0,howtoworkonlinenow,0,0.5,False
1hc2te8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MSCCruises/comments/1hc2te8/overcharged_at_amber_cove/,Overcharged at Amber Cove,"We were told we’d be docking at Taino Bay, the only mention of Amber Cove was on the pamphlets put outside of our door the evening before. That was already disappointing, as we were looking forward to exploring Puerto Plata on our own (instead of an excursion). When we got to Amber Cove, the only option to get to Puerto Plata and back was a $110 taxi cab. 


We decided to cut our losses and return to the boat after checking out one of the restaurants ($35 bill with a cash tip left - ‘cash’ written in receipt tip line) buying a coconut ($5, no tip or signature) and then getting two frozen coffees at the coffee shop ($12+$2 tip written on receipt). 


Looking at my cc statement after arriving at home, I see the baristas helped themselves to an extra $28 on my tip, totaling $42. Of course I didn’t get a copy of my receipt (nor was I offered one, and the language barrier conveniently kicked in when I asked). Just wondering if anyone else has felt scammed by MSC’s bait-and-switch with the docking ports, or have actually been scammed with an extra tip.
