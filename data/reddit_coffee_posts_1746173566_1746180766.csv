1kcxc18,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kcxc18/looking_for_critique/,Looking for critique,"This is just a small draft of a story which came into my mind last night, it really stuck with me so I just thought about writing it, honestly I’m super embarrassed and its kinda cringe but I want advice whether the plot is too overdone or if I’ve made any mistakes in my knowledge or if there’s any plotholes I think you get the point anyways !!

The cafe was bustling, at 7:30 in the morning as you might expect with people gathering in order to grab something to pull them through the day. I sat in the corner watching as a woman with a large flame around her yelled at the cashier for her soy milk latte. Her flame was surprisingly big, I wonder what she could have done, its not big enough for a type of murder no, but it could be a type of fraud? I watched as she huffed to edge of the counter waiting for her drink, impatiently tapping her foot and dramatically looking at her watch. The baristas were clearly trying to make her drink as fast as possible to deescalate the commotion. I examined her intensely, she had doe-like brown eyes with silky golden hair, she was quite beautiful. She carried a comically sized carrier bag which could fit her whole torso, she wore one of those thick long jackets, the ones that look cool but aren’t waterproof and dragged along the ground if you were too short—I’m sure you know the ones. Otherwise she wore mainly professional attire, which makes me wonder if thats where she got her entitled attitude from, or if she always had it. One of the baristas quickly rushed over to her and personally handed her drink with a cheesy smile obviously trying to get her to leave without wanting it to be too obvious - which she failed at but I think the woman is too stuck up to notice. Assuming she would leave I turned to my own coffee, now cold and distant. 
“AHHHHHH!” 
I whipped around to look “This lattes too hot you insufferable-!” Golden-haired lady squealed stopping herself. I glanced at the barista red faced and worried. Before I could process the situation the golden-haired lady took off the lid of the latte and poured it over the barista. Steam came rushing off her as she screamed and noticeable red marks where the drink first hit her face. Her uniform was soaked in a light brown colour. I wonder if thats why her flame was that big? People rushed to the barista making sure she was alright, all signs of work had stopped and she was surrounded by possibly worried citizens. During this time the golden-haired lady left, even I didn’t see her leave. As everyone was crowded around I decided to leave too. I had seen enough.

The street outside was lined with cars and few pedestrians walking. The cars began to honk frustrated at the traffic jam that was probably caused due to the recent road work up ahead. Whilst I walked I noticed the golden-haired lady talking to someone on her bedazzled phone. Her voice was surprisingly softer as she discussed the next big project with someone. A stark contrast to the scene I had witnessed just moments ago. As I watched her I went back to thinking of her flame, I had never seen one quite like it. You see, I have a specific.. skill you might call it, it sounds very silly I know and I don’t even know how to describe it myself. I can see people’s sin. It manifests in a dark flame surrounding them I’ve come to learn only I can see, I don’t truly understand it but I’ve come to know that people only gain a significant flame after hurting someone. Whether directly or indirectly. Nearly everyone has one but its so little I have to concentrate really hard to see. Gaining a substantial flame is quite the feat, obviously things like murder and rape, truly traumatising acts create massive flames. But other things like fraud and robbery can also cause larges flames. I’ve studied my power and tested other people in ways to see how people gain their flame, if they can lose it or if it gets bigger over time. I’d love to tell you I have all the answers but honestly I have no idea. But I do know this, the flame isn’t a blessing or a curse, its simply an added skill. In some situations an advantage, like once when I was young I had lost my family on a day out. A woman came up to me with a massive flame “Honey are you alright? You look lost.” She spoke sweetly. I stared at her, well her flame. The issue with the flame is I have no idea what the person’s has done, how many times they’ve done it or how long ago. I can make assumptions of their sin by the size but really thats it. My child self stared at this woman before mumbling “No my mummys coming to get me.” Trying hard to not make it obvious I was lying. The lady scorned slightly before wandering off. Soon I found my family and all was well until a week later, that same lady was in the news as a serial-kidnapper. I’ve always wondered if it not for my skill if I would have become a victim? 
A car honked loudly and I realised I was in the middle of the road. Crap. I have a habit of zoning out. I quickly ran off and looked for any indication of how far I’d come, the golden-haired lady was gone. Luckily I was on the right path. I glanced at my watch 8:15. I was going to be early but I didn’t mind. Due to my skill I decided to train to become a detective, I thought it would be easy but who knew there was more to detective work than just solving crimes. The station was just another 15 minutes away. The walk was uneventful and I eventually found myself at the door. “Good morning Detective Grimwood, early as usual.” It was Detective Blythe “Ah, nearly forgot I wanted to speak to you about something, a new case had emerged, a homicide, I wanted to know if you were nearly done the paperwork for your last. I know you have a knack for homicide cases.” The detective said as if he was proud of my work.
 “Actually I have I was just about to put it in storage now if you want to come with me and explain the details?” I asked, I specialise in homicide cases, due to my skill I tend to cross out suspects with small flames and then try to find evidence for the one or two people with an obvious one, the flame is obvious through photo and videos, I’ve even noticed that the flame grows on photos of the person before they even committed their sins.
“I would be glad too—lets go—this case has been handed over to us but since I just glanced at it I don’t know the full story just yet but it seems cut and dry. A woman was found shot in her apartment by her twin— speaking of which you have a twin right Grimwood?” The detective asked casually 
“I do a twin sister,” I answered thinking it was the most peculiar time to be asked that.
“Ah yes well she had a boyfriend, well ex but apparently it was a recent, messy break up— yes right this way—so just by that I think we can make a fair guess.”
“Well we never know unless we look at the facts.” I responded as nonchalantly as possible because well I was lying. 
In the storage room I placed down the box filled with old paper and evidence. I find everytime I put a case down I feel guilty—to me this is just work but for these people; these are their lives.
“Yes, of course but it’s a start if theres someone with a motive.”
I looked up at my superior. Something I rarely done, he was a short man with a grizzly bead and a hair colour which people would argue over whether it was dark brown or black. Astoundingly he had quite a significant flame, which if I didn’t know any better would scare me away but he was a kindhearted man. I heard he messed with the wrong kinds when he was younger which probably resulted in his flame but it was also what inspired him to become a part of the law.
“Anyways the case file is on my desk, it’s the top one of the pile, I have to stay in here and check out something.” Detective Blythe spoke as dramatically turned around and caressed his beard as if he were in deep thought. 
“Alright thanks.” I replied without looking back. The clock on the wall stated it had only been 7 minutes, the other people on my team won’t be arriving until later. Everyone from the overnight shift resembled zombies. You could hear faint chatter and loud sips of coffee. Our office was amazingly untidy but also somehow very organised, we all knew where everything was even if we had to dig to find it. I found the case file on detective Blythes desk, as one of our supervisors he had his own desk, the other detectives on the other hand had to practically fight for one. As for me I had to wait for the people from the night shift to leave and take their belongings. I opened the file carefully, the first thing I saw was photos of the suspects & deceased with their names and who they were, Elaine Keller - The deceased. Cassandra Merrit - the deceaseds roommate. Wyatt Robinson - the deceaseds ex boyfriend the main suspect. Esther Keller- The deceaseds twin sister who found her. Katherine Stevenson and John Stevenson - downstairs neighbours who heard the gunshot. Nate White -  A close friend of the main suspect. Scribbled in red in said “Possible accomplice” next to Nates name. Clearly everyone had made their mind up. Glancing at their photos I noticed.. a strange pattern. Every single one of them had a noticeable flame, aside from Katherine but I assume she wasn’t involved very much. Nothing like this had ever happened before it’s usually hard to find anyone with a significant flame but 6 people? However I would bet John was some sort of veteran and thats why is flame is so big. Thats again one of the issues with my skill, people who do bad things for good reasons aren’t an exception, I used to watch true crime documentaries to test it and I noticed no matter the reason, whether an accident or self defence people get a flame just as big as someone who maliciously killed someone. Skimming through specific descriptions of all the suspects I saw none of them had any previous criminal record—not even a possession charge— which wouldn’t come up on their flame anyways. Is this like a Murder On The Orient Express situation? Glancing at the photographs from the crime scene something odd stuck out to me the body had obviously been moved about after being shot. The photos shown a woman—Elaine—on the floor arms spread out and face turned to the left, there was a bullet hole directly through her neck, she would have died very quickly. But the main thing that stood out were the blood splatters, she was shot in the right carotid artery yet the blood splatters was obviously not from an arterial bleed. Her flame made it slightly hard to see but you could see the blood pooling beneath her which probably meant her body was moved fairly fast after death but you would expect to see some trail of blood from where she was moved from but there was none. Another photo showed where she must have been shot. Dark red blood splattered up and down a white wall making it a dramatic contrast, you could see she must have turned before falling to the ground as the blood shot to the side before reaching up the floor.

If you've ever seen even one terrible horror series on Netflix, you're probably expecting me to go lumbering room to room now, shouting something like, 'Who's there?' or, 'Is everything okay?'

Go on, admit it. You're hearing moody string music and anticipating some crappy jump scare when, I don't know, a blooming owl flies into my head or something.

So, yeah. That didn't happen.

Quietly, I switched off my phone's light and dropped it in my pocket, taking out the kitchen knife I'd brought from home and reversing the blade so that it lay parallel to the inside of my forearm. I'd ummed and ahhed about bringing this on my journey - the last thing I needed was to be shook down by the police as I made my way across London - but remembering I was in possession of the right shade of skin to make 'stop and search' a problem for other people, I'd gone for it.

Then I shut my eyes and took some long, deep breaths.

It might seem counterproductive, but shutting your eyes actually helps with your night vision. It gives your photoreceptors a break from any lingering light, allowing them to adjust more quickly to the dark. Basically, it's like telling them to take a quick power nap: ""Okay, team, shut down and reboot so we can handle this dimly lit environment and whoever is playing silly buggers upstairs without stumbling over the coffee table."" Reset complete, I opened my eyes wide.

The world is never as dark as you think. There’s a life lesson in that there, I thought.

What had seemed utterly pitch-black after being bathed in Keith's headlights and then having Steve Job's finest work beaming away in my hand turned out to be actually pretty navigable in the grand scheme of things. Thus, moving with far more grace and care than you'd suspect someone of my size and hairiness to possess, I began to glide around the ground floor of the cottage.

Every room was a dark tableau of life paused, artefacts of my aunt’s existence scattered and forgotten on every surface. Books lined the shelves, most of their spines thoroughly cracked, and their titles obscured by dust. Strange devices, remnants of M’s variety of peculiar academic interests, lay abandoned on tables and in corners.

No further screams pierced the air, but my spidey senses were at full-on tingle. The noise had come from upstairs, but there was no way I was moving away from the possible escape route of the front door before I’d made damned sure the downstairs was clear of potential nasties.

I briefly paused in the last room on the left, which I knew used to be my mother’s when she was a kid. Stepping in, I softly ran my hand over a collection of old vinyl records and reel-to-reel tapes. Without knowing why, I felt a sense of . . . something settle in my stomach as my fingers touched the dusty covers. There was so much history here . . .

But then a further sound broke the silence—a faint whisper, barely audible but unmistakably there. I froze, straining to hear the words. Then the whisper grew louder, and a disjointed murmur leaked out of the walls. Heart pounding, I moved to place my free hand against the wallpaper, with the disorientation of some seriously profound deja vu stealing over me.

I'd experienced this weird sensation in Halfway Hold before.

But, before I could think too much about that, the sound came again, but this time, it started from above. Following the noise led me back to the staircase, and I knew the soft chittering was coming from up there. Bats? Was that something that actually happened to people in the countryside? I remembered all those broken windows . . .

And what about the scream? What was that all about?

Steeling myself, I climbed the stairs, each step a creak of protest, which did little to calm my nerves. I was suddenly much less appreciative of my aunt's complete lack of woodwork upkeep.

As quietly as I could manage, I reached the top step, crouching down and transferring the knife from hand to hand. There were few things in life I hated more than a knife fight. But as one of them would be being dead, I guessed such things were relative.

I poked my head around the bannister, but the upstairs was even darker than the space below. If there was anyone waiting up there, I certainly couldn't see them. Which I had to assume meant they couldn’t see me. The noise, though, had become more intense. I couldn't make out the words, but it was definitely some sort of whispered speech.

And then there was another high-pitched scream and my heart rate went through the roof.

What was going on!

My shaking was getting out of control. It wasn't just the freezing cold – my word, I could actually see my breath! How had it just got this icy? - but the surge of adrenaline was far too intense to handle. I needed to smooth that off before I moved. I filled my lungs with several deep, silent breaths, the extra oxygen flooding to muscles that I feared were about to get very busy.

Then, nerves a touch settled, I moved low in a crab-like motion, following the sound to an open door at the end of the hall.

A door behind which, I knew, lay Aunt M's study.

I pressed myself against the wall beside it and glanced back at the stairs—no one seemed to be following me up. I was as confident as I could be that the rest of the cottage was empty, and despite all that had happened recently, I was willing to bet the whole ball game on that assessment being correct. Whoever was making the whispering, chittering - punctuated with bizarre screams - was in Aunt M's study. And they were alone in the cottage.

Crouched down, I pushed the door open further, feeling another gust of freezing air wash out.

Two choices. Firstly, I could carefully peer inside and try to get the lay of the land. I'd usually do this via some sort of snazzy fibre-optic device or, failing that, even something simple like a little hand-held mirror would do in a pinch. Lacking both, though, on this occasion, I'd be poking my head around the corner of the door frame, which would give whoever was in there every opportunity to shoot me in the face.

I’ve seen it happen, and the results ain’t pretty. I’m going to need all my available charms now I’m newly single, and the bullet-hole fetish scene isn’t for me. So, I thought Choice A was pretty suboptimal, all things considered.

Choice B was to go a bit more primaeval and trust a little to luck. Primaeval being my middle name, and feeling that Lady Luck owed me a bit after going missing this year, I figured there was no point overthinking these things . . .

I slammed the door open all the way, the noise of it crashing against the wall insanely loud in the cottage's stillness. But not quite as loud as me stomping into the room, giving it my best 'ARMED POLICE! PUT YOUR WEAPONS DOWN!""

It's been mentioned I have the tendency to be a touch intimidating when I want to be. More than once, just a casual roll of my shoulders has defused any number of alcohol-related flare-ups. Even drunk, most people can decide there are better, more fun, ways to end up in A&E.

It had been my subtly threatening demeanour on the floor of a club which, young as I had been, had first grabbed Griff's attention after all. Or, as he had put it, ""You look like an utter mentalist! Like you’re one missed dose of diazepam away from leading on the national news. Fancy an apprenticeship?""

I guess what I'm trying to say is that when I want to, I know how to make a bit of an entrance. Which made the fact that my aunt's study was completely empty utterly anti-climactic.

And it wasn't like there were many places to hide. Holding up my phone's torchlight once again, I could see that the little room was a tiny, cluttered space filled with old furniture, boxes, and a myriad of dust-covered objects. It didn't look like anyone had been in here for a very long time. Much longer, actually, than I thought Aunt M had been dead for.

Had she stopped coming in here for some reason?

Nevertheless, despite the space being completely empty, the whispering hadn't stopped. It was now a constant background hum, like a distant conversation between friends just out of sight.

And then I saw it.

Something that certainly hadn’t been here the last time I’d used this place as a refuge from Meddings’ family drama. An old gramophone stood in the centre of the room, its horn gleaming in the dim light. I approached it, my breath billowing from me in great clouds like I was some sort of epic chain-smoking dragon.

Aunt M would have wanted me to see this if it had been here last time I was here. She knew I lived for stuff like this. I presumed it must have been something she had picked up reasonably recently.

Well, no. It was years since I'd last been here. This could well have been here for nine or ten years. A touch of guilt hit me right where I lived at that thought. Which was when I saw there was a record on the gramophone and a set of headphones lying next to it. And then I noticed my aunt’s crabbed handwriting on the label of the black disk: “For Elijah.” As soon as I'd read that, the whispering immediately ceased, replaced by the low buzz of the record beginning to spin.

Well, that was bizarre. It was like someone had just placed the needle and started the record up.

I looked around the room, but no. All was still empty. Frowning, I reached forward and put on the headphones, hearing the recording crackling away: my aunt’s voice echoing in my ears, clear and haunting.

“If you are hearing this, it means I have failed and everything I have worked to prevent will be coming to pass. They are not to be trusted, Elijah, you hear me? They are not. They will be seeking to push through and the Guardian must bar their way. I’m sorry, Elijah. I should have been careful. But they cannot be allowed to come through! You must put yourself in their path. You must prevent the merging from coming to pass!”

A shiver ran down my spine, and I removed the headphones with a jerk. I stared at the gramophone, unsure how I was supposed to react to that warning from beyond the grave. I didn’t need Aunt M to tell me Halfway Hold was a dark place, a place where horror and reality blurred. But, somehow, I didn’t think she meant it in a prosaic, 'oh-my-poor-childhood-sucked-let’s-revisit-the-pain' kind of way.

And then I heard the floorboard creak behind me.

The woman stood there didn’t say a word. She just raised her gun and let off two shots. One after the other. And both into my chest. Very tidy work, I thought dispassionately. Like she’d done this before and possibly given a seminar on it.

I recognised the gun. Not in a huh, that looks familiar way. No, more in a standard-issue to three different intelligence agencies and two that aren’t supposed to exist style. Compact, low recoil, ceramic components. It was designed to be forgotten in scanners and remembered in autopsies. Apparently, Katja from the train hadn’t come to play.

My phone slipped from my hand as I fell. The knife I was holding also followed it to the floor. This felt rude, somehow. Like I should have at least tried to keep hold of one of them. Falling backwards - catastrophic chest wounds have that sort of effect - I collided with the gramophone.

Which, weirdly, cracked open. Not like in a broken machine way. More like it was a piece of fruit that had been fermenting too long. All the air in the attic lurched sideways and time seemed to hiccup and it suddenly felt like I was falling through something that wasn't strictly space but might have shared a few of its hobbies.

As I tumbled, my killer leaned in after me. Not to help. Probably to make sure she’d finished the job. Like a toddler really grinding her heal down on an especially ugly bug.

And then everything, including me, went entirely black.",1,1746180531.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

(M32 to M31, F31)","TL;DR: Back in town for the first time in over a decade and would like to catch up with old friends that I haven't seen or heard from in years. How long is too long before that's weird?


I'll preface this by saying I'm a big overthinker/catastrophiser.

I [32M] am from the UK and studied abroad in New York when I was 19 and haven't had the chance/time/money to go back since. As a result I gradually lost touch with people from what I remember fondly as one of the happiest years of my life. In a couple of months I have the chance to go back for the first time, but wonder how strange it would be to try and reconnect while I'm there, just for a drink or a coffee or whatever to catch up/see how everyone'slives are going. There are a few different ""groups"" of people though.

There are the guys I lived with for a year who from what I see on social media still live in or around the city. I still send the odd message to one now and then and he'd be a shoe in to meet (and I know he'd be up for it), another came to study abroad in my city the year after but we lost touch since, and the others I lost touch with early on.

There a girl I was dating while over there, and broke up when I moved back. She studied abroad in the UK for a while too, but we only met up once since we found it too sad knowing she was going back. We stayed friends for a short while after then gradually stopped speaking. Last I saw on socials she was engaged, but I would genuinely only want to see how to see how her life has worked out (obviously nothing romantic etc). Doubt her fiance knows about me, but not sure how he'd feel about it if he did. This one maybe feels like the biggest non-starter/bad idea, and honestly not sure she'd reply if I messaged (not that we ended on bad terms or anything). But she was a huge part of that time of my life, and I would love to find that she's doing well and happy.

Then there are people I had classes with, hung out with while I was there. There's only really one that I kept any kind of contact with and it would be sporadic couple of days of catch up then stopping again, but last time was years ago. The others I think would be fun to see, but also not like we were super close even while I was there (but we were friends). Think the former would be down, but not sure of the latter.

What do people think? Is it weird to reach out to these people? If they were in my town and sent a message I'd be keen on meeting but I don't know if they'd feel the same way. I guess that worst thing that happens is they say no or don't reply, and they're not currently in my life anyway so what's the harm, but I also don't want to come across odd asking to meet people that might not have even thought about me in years (even if I still think of them).",1,1746180208.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

I'm new to the world of pour over coffee. Started with Hario V60 and small bags of specialty direct trade beans (Kean & Wakuli), that they grinded for me.

Sorry for the blasphemy, but bought a kettle and grinder from Temu. Feels really sturdy to be honest. Once I have money I'll upgrade, but first wanted to try it this way😁

I'm not sure what grind size should be (it has a range from 1 to 35), so started of with 20.

Finally, here to write my own success story :)

**Why CISSP**\- The exam in itself is great, however the process of preparation, the ups and downs of your schedule, the discipline to study with everything else going on (moving countries, managing a toddler, up for promotion at work etc etc) and finally taking the exam, where every question triggers your knowledge and experience, is what makes it a real gem.  
to all those, who think it isn't worth it - It's not the exam in itself, it's the learning and concepts you nail, while studying for it. It also instils a disciplined and risk assessed approach and greatly impacts your day to day job.

**What To expect after the exam-**

The endorsement process took about a week and the certificate was delivered within 6 weeks from then. *My experience*: 12 years in corporate security, started with service based companies and been in product based for 9 years.  
3 months of on and off preparation( 2 hours a day), 1 month of dedicated prep and 2 weeks of just taking exam simulations from the official CISSP guide.

**Books and All:**

**Physical books**\-  
Sybex- Official Guide and Practice Tests, Eleventh hour- for revision and Shon Harris (for specific concepts)

**Digital books:** Destination CISSP- Mindmaps (after reading through each chapter), How to Think like a manager (I didn't it find it great)

**Free Resources:**

\- Pete Zerger: Cram, most important topics, mindset, questions, etc.

\- 50 CISSP Practice Questions - Andrew Ramdayal (to get into the right mindset)

\- Why you will pass the CISSP - Kelly Handerhan

**Planning and Exam Day:**

Took the Exam Slot for around 11:00 am, so I had an easy morning schedule to reach the exam centre.  
Took a Espresso, right before the exam. Took my break when I started to feel stuck- had a coffee and a chocolate (Sugar helps) and deep breathing.  
Used Elimination technique wherever I felt stuck.  
Spent most time on first 50 Questions, and then last 10 questions before hitting 100 question mark.

**Above and Beyond Resources:**

\- DestCert- mindmaps -Rob Witcher - Best to do a quick revision. I used to watch all these videos, while walking on Treadmill.

\- Pete Zerger and Andrew Ramdayal- on youtube- they will get you in the mindset you need for the exam.

\- Sybex Offical Question bank- I do believe it's very underrated. I didn't buy any simulation exams, and Sybex was enough to get me on the track.

**You have it in you :)**  
Sleep well, the night before. Don't clutter your day with last minute revisions and stress. Keep your day as easy as possible to go with a fresh head.  
it will feel like an imposter, but trust your preparation and experience and know that, you have what it takes.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The 19 Crimes Wine Banished Dark Red Blend boasts several key features that contribute to its distinctive character.

**Blend Composition:** This dark red blend typically comprises a mix of grape varietals, including Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Grenache. The precise percentages may vary slightly from vintage to vintage, but the overall goal is to create a harmonious and balanced wine with a rich, full-bodied profile. This combination allows for a complex interplay of flavors and aromas, contributing to the wine's overall appeal.

**Oak Aging:** The wine undergoes oak aging, which imparts notes of vanilla, spice, and toast. The length and type of oak used (e.g., American or French) influence the intensity of these flavors. Oak aging also contributes to the wine's structure and tannins, providing a smoother and more integrated mouthfeel.

**Alcohol Content:** The Banished Dark Red Blend generally has an alcohol content of around 13.5-14.5% ABV (Alcohol by Volume). This level provides a good balance of intensity and drinkability, making it suitable for enjoying on its own or pairing with a variety of foods. The higher alcohol content contributes to the wine's full body and warming sensation.

**Aroma Profile:** The aroma profile is characterized by dark fruit notes, such as blackberry, plum, and cherry, along with hints of chocolate, coffee, and spice. The oak aging adds layers of vanilla and toast, creating a complex and inviting bouquet. The interplay of these aromas enhances the overall sensory experience.

Key features of the 19 Crimes Wine Banished Dark Red Blend include:

*   A rich and complex flavor profile

*   Smooth tannins and a full body

*   An accessible price point

I know we might never meet—maybe you're reading this on a random Thursday, sipping your coffee (or tea, no judgement here), feeling kinda overwhelmed by everything around you. And honestly, I get it. Life's been throwing some pretty wild curveballs lately, and it's easy to feel like you're just one drop in this vast ocean, barely staying afloat.

But hey, if no one's told you today, you're doing better than you think. Even when it feels like every step is a struggle, there's a quiet strength in just getting through each day. I truly believe that, even when the world feels heavy.

So, here's a little reminder from one stranger to another: your presence makes a difference. Let's keep holding onto small moments of joy—like when your favorite song comes on or when your pet gives you that look of unconditional love. Those bits might be tiny, but they add up.

Stay strong, keep believing in brighter days ahead, and remember—someone out here is rooting for you.

Anybody have any tips on how to change poop routines?,"Hi guys, almost 20 year IBS-D victim here. I think most of us with IBS have a daily toilet routine (besides the random diareeha attacks offcorse). For me, for more than 10 years, that was going to the toilet to poop 4x in the morning. Yes thats right. 4x. Every. Single. Morning. Forcefully if needed. 

I started like a normal person when I was younger with 1 bowel movement a day, then had bad experiences so it went to 2, more bad experiences, discomfort, 3, trigger foods and stress really started to get to me, 4.... And I told myself no matter what, I'm already going FOUR FRICKEN TIMES, WHAT AM I GONNA GO 5??!! So I literally had to fight back against myself to not go more than 4x a morning. 

I would wake up at 5.45 so that I could leave the house at 7.45. And that has been my life for as long as I can remember. If I had to be somewhere earlier then 7.30? Sorry can't make it. Because I would crap my pants on the way. 

Fast forward to the last 2-3 months, long story short, I have been doing the best of my abilities to bring my morning poo routine down to ATLEAST 3x a morning. I've been seeing a naturopath, done a natural cleanse with herbal supplements, rebuilding the health of my gut and microbiome, watching my diet for trigger foods, doing my best to avoid toxic foods etc etc etc.

But no matter what, I still end up pooing 4x a day. 

I have been purposely going 3x in the morning and have been able to get away with it most of the time, but come 5-6PM towards night time, my bowels are aching and ready to explode for another bowel movement. 

I just can't bring myself back down to poo 3x a day. 3 fricken times doesn't seem to be enough for my bowels... I have tried to stimulate my bowels with coffee or tea in the morning to really squeeze everything out during my bowel movements but that made no difference. 

Is there anyway to reduce the frequency of my daily bowel movements??? 

I got to going 4x a day primarily due to my own psychological fears and problems. Why is it that I can't now reprogram myself to bring the number back down??? 

This has affected my life so badly I cannot begin to describe...

What I mean by that is - if I make a plan with both of them or either of them, I stick to it. I don’t change the times, locations, don’t override with other suggestions. I like the structure like this. It reduces unnecessary stress and makes things easier. But they seem to change or override plans all the time which makes frustrated, but also makes me feel like maybe I have to be more “go with the flow” person like them?

For example - it’s been a few months since we had a nice sit down catch up with both of them (they have been busy and cancelled on a few of my suggestions to meet up). I had very challenging few months and I wanted to have an open conversation with them - I needed my friends.
I suggested a dinner this week again. One agreed to do it on Friday, the other said she’s booked all week and instead suggested going to the gym together and grabbing a coffee Friday morning (though she asked if she can confirm the time Thursday evening because she’s going out and might want to sleep in a bit). Friday morning comes, no messages from her. The other friend texts me asking if we can add her and another girl to dinner on Friday because their Friday plans got cancelled. Then the gym girl texts me saying that the plans she had got cancelled because of her fault and that she feels like she needs to take that friend out and would like to join the dinner and maybe go to the club afterwards. So basically, the sit down catch-up I wanted to have with my close friends will not happen because there will be additional people who I am not comfortable opening up in front of, and now it’s becoming more about entertaining this new girl instead of joining the dinner I suggested. 
I feel a bit hurt but at the same time I feel like maybe there is something wrong with my approach? Are my expectations and approach too strict? Maybe I have to be more open to what other people want to do? I know that if I said something about want this, I’d lose my friends. They’d think I’m boring, not fun to be around. I always thought that being a good friend means following through and respecting the plans made by others, but somehow I feel like I have less friends and I am less connected to people who are way more easy going about these things than I am.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.

I've been using it for about a few weeks now, and from what I taste, its a pretty good brew, with a pretty decent strength. I really am a fan of this brewing method, and I really enjoy the mechanics of a moka pot. Im Vietnamese so most of my experiences of coffee brewing, is with a cheap phin filter (which tbh is amazing), so a moka pot is a new and fun change. Seeing on youtube, people really dislike the chinese moka pots, it concerned me a bit that I might be robbed of an expereince. I just am curious what the legit bialetti moka pots are like in comparison to mines. There is a significant price different, as in vietnam a bialetti 6 cup moka pot express would cost around 45$ (NINE TIMES THE PRICE), but if the difference is worth it, ill def cough up some more for one. For now I just wanna see how you guys feel abt it",1,1746178597.0,mokapot,3,1.0,False

As she is my best friend,I share everything with her. I actually liked the guy a lot. He belongs to a really cultural and religious family and is quite talented. 

After the first meet up(calling it a meet up as he didn't call it a ""date"")i shared everything to my friend,B. She listened patiently. 
There was this brief period of time when Mr.A ghosted me. He came back again,and we met again. That's when he asked me if i have any friends? To which I replied,yes,it's Ms.B.

He initially wanted to set her up with another friend of his. So he started talking to her,and I got completely sidetracked. But i trusted Ms.B,she was my best friend. I asked her to update me about any talking that takes place amd she agreed to,but she didn't. She ignored Me,my msgs and my calls. At this point,I was sure both of them were having a good time talking to each other. 

I do not have a solid proof to prove she's indulging with him. But then why would she even accept his chat request,start talking to him? Both of them acted like I was non existent,Ignored my texts and calls,Let me marinate into second guessing their intentions.


Yes the guy is as guilty as the girl is. 
But he was a random person. This girl tho,Ms.B,was my best friend. 
Did she not know the girl code? Why would she do that to me? I stood with her in her worst times.

But for backstory, the last time I had a gf go away on a long trip, I found out pretty quickly that she fucked someone whilst away. The way I found out was as graphic as you can imagine, without being in the room during the act.
Fast forward a decade and lots of therapy and a few relationships later, my current gf for the first time since the one above, went away as well on a wedding trip. She has been keeping me informed via pics and stuff but in her group there is this one girl who is masculine presenting lesbian that she is seemingly a little too close for comfort. They're all close to each other in most of the pics she sent me and when I called her this week on video, she admitted she was sharing a bed at the resort with someone - but it wasn't the girl I am suspicious of at least making a move on my girl.
A quick instagram check shows that this ""cool"" lesbian person is a bit of a fuckboy. She follows a lot of onlyfans girls, posts thirst trap that would appeal to most women and is a bit of a party animal. This morning I also found out that she posted my girl in the kitchen making coffee, wearing the lesbians house slippers..

This morning I also found out that she posted my girl in the kitchen making coffee, wearing the lesbians house slippers..

I'm not saying that she scissored my girl for sure, but I just have this sick feeling that at the very least she made a move and my girl possibly entertained it. How do l ask her without starting a fight when she comes back?

These bigger tiktoker accounts being the focus and how they've all sold their greedy souls to the app over money, but how they also seem to create as much drama and problems for themselves. Even adding in the gifting aspect and the psychology of how viewers are made to feel like they need to gift, then how they're all taken advantage of.

Although there is a six-year age gap between us, we are both currently in our first year of university, as we each took a gap before starting our studies.

We spoke for about three weeks, and during that short time, we built a strong connection. I had already shared my recent photos with him early on, and he seemed genuinely interested. He even told his parents about me, and I had told my grandmother about him as well.

We truly enjoyed each other’s personalities. He spoke about marriage and seemed sincere in his intentions. I am 4’11 and tend to look younger than my age—people often assume I am 15 or 16. Today, I shared my Instagram with him, and some of the older pictures there might have made me appear even younger than in the recent photos I had sent earlier.

After that, I noticed a shift. He suddenly began putting in less effort and said he was busy, which felt unusual, especially considering how just a short while ago, he would drink coffee late at night just to stay up and talk to me. When I called him an hour later, he said he was going to sleep and would call the next day, but I could sense something had changed.

I gently told him that if he was no longer attracted to me, it was okay. I didn’t want him to feel obligated, and I let him know he could be honest. He didn’t deny it. He mentioned that we hadn’t met yet and that I had been hesitant about video calls.

He lives four hours away, and we had originally planned to meet in September. At first, I wasn’t ready to meet sooner, but because I feared losing him, I told him I would be open to meeting in MAY instead. Still, I could feel his interest had started to fade so I told him if he wants to end things he can and he didn’t deny and we both ended it right an hour ago . 


I find myself wondering if he might reach out again in a day or two. He once seemed to really care for my personality, and it makes me wonder—do appearances really matter this much in the end? My heart feels heavy because I had grown used to his presence. I really liked him, and it’s difficult to let go so suddenly.

I would truly appreciate any thoughts or advice on this situation.

Do you think he was just being impulsive ? And will he reach out again ? Or are we done ? I unmatched him from
Muzz and removed him from insta , he still has my number tho . Also from his pov , it’s completely valid to be attracted to older women and not younger cuz he’s 26 and even tho I’m 20 , I look like 16 . Apart from this in the last 3 weeks , he fell for my personality, he liked me a lot like he although he wasn’t very practicing in the beginning, when I told him I would only consider marriage with someone who prays five times a day, he made a real effort. He began praying four times a day regularly. I would sincerely ask Allah for guidance, and each time I did, we seemed to grow closer. He also was sincerely thinking about marriage with me and even told his fam , he would think about me and text me all the time . So was he just being impulsive and will he come back ? And also please advise me about the whole thing .

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best home decor items of 2025 offer a blend of style, functionality, and sustainability. Here are some key features to look for when choosing pieces for your home.

**Sustainable Materials:** The use of eco-friendly materials is a significant trend in home decor. Look for items made from recycled materials, sustainably sourced wood, or organic fabrics. These materials not only reduce your environmental impact but also often have a unique and natural aesthetic appeal. From recycled glass vases to furniture made from reclaimed wood, there are numerous options to choose from.

**Versatile Design:** Pieces that can adapt to different styles and spaces are highly valuable. Items with neutral colors, clean lines, and simple shapes can be easily incorporated into various decor schemes. A versatile sofa with interchangeable cushions or a coffee table with adjustable height are examples of furniture that can adapt to your changing needs.

**Smart Home Integration:** With the rise of smart home technology, decor items that integrate seamlessly with your existing systems are becoming increasingly popular. This includes smart lighting fixtures, automated blinds, and even smart mirrors that can display information and control other devices in your home. Smart home integration adds convenience and efficiency to your daily life.

**Artisanal Craftsmanship:** Handcrafted items add a personal touch to your home decor. Look for pieces made by local artisans or those that showcase traditional techniques. These items often have a unique story and a higher level of quality compared to mass-produced products. Handmade ceramics, woven textiles, and carved wooden sculptures are excellent examples of artisanal decor.

**Comfort and Functionality:** While aesthetics are important, comfort and functionality should not be overlooked. Choose furniture and decor items that are both visually appealing and practical for your daily life. A comfortable armchair, a well-organized storage unit, or a functional kitchen island can enhance your living experience.

**Modular Systems:** Modular furniture systems offer flexibility and adaptability to different spaces and needs. These systems consist of individual components that can be arranged and rearranged to create various configurations. Modular sofas, shelving units, and storage systems are ideal for maximizing space and creating customized layouts.

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in quality home decor can bring numerous benefits to your life and your living space. Here are some key advantages of choosing the right pieces.

Carefully chosen colors, textures, and patterns can create a cohesive and visually appealing atmosphere. This can improve your overall mood and sense of well-being.

**Improved Functionality:** Well-designed decor items can also enhance the functionality of your home. For example, a storage ottoman can provide extra seating and storage space, while a well-placed mirror can brighten up a room and create the illusion of more space. Functional decor items can make your daily life easier and more efficient.

**Increased Home Value:** Investing in high-quality home decor can increase the value of your property. Potential buyers are often attracted to homes that are well-maintained and aesthetically pleasing. Upgrading your decor can be a smart investment if you plan to sell your home in the future.

**Personal Expression:** Your home decor is a reflection of your personal style and preferences. Choosing pieces that resonate with you can create a space that feels authentic and unique. This can make you feel more comfortable and at home in your living space.

**Improved Mood and Well-being:** Studies have shown that our surroundings can have a significant impact on our mood and well-being. A well-decorated and organized home can reduce stress and create a sense of calm and relaxation. Choosing colors, textures, and patterns that you find soothing can improve your overall mental health.

 ## FAQs Section

Here are some frequently asked questions about home decor to help you make informed decisions.

**How do I choose the right color palette for my home?**
Choosing the right color palette depends on your personal preferences and the overall atmosphere you want to create. Consider the natural lighting in your home and the existing colors of your furniture and flooring. You can use online color palette generators or consult with a professional interior designer to find the perfect combination for your space.

**What are some sustainable home decor options?**
There are many sustainable home decor options available, including furniture made from recycled materials, organic cotton bedding, and eco-friendly paint. Look for items that are certified by reputable organizations, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS).

**How can I maximize space in a small apartment?**
In a small apartment, it's important to choose furniture that is both functional and space-saving. Look for items with built-in storage, such as storage ottomans or beds with drawers. Use vertical space by installing shelves or hanging artwork on the walls. Avoid clutter by keeping your belongings organized and minimizing unnecessary items.

**How often should I update my home decor?**
There is no set rule for how often you should update your home decor. It depends on your personal preferences and budget. Some people enjoy changing their decor seasonally, while others prefer to make gradual updates over time. Consider updating your decor when you feel that your space is outdated or no longer reflects your personal style.

You are radiant in ways most people don’t even know how to hold. The way you laugh with your whole body, how your eyes light up when you talk about something you care about, how you remember the little details—birthdays, favorite snacks, how someone takes their coffee. That’s rare. That’s beautiful. That’s you.

You’re the kind of person who lifts others just by being near them. Who asks how someone’s really doing and stays to hear the answer. Who brings light into rooms that didn’t even know they were dark.

You are a lover of life, even when it’s unkind. Bubbly, bright, tender-hearted. The kind of soul who cries over movies and rescues bugs and sends long texts just to remind someone they’re loved. You give hugs that feel like safety. You speak in encouragement. You see people. You believe in them. And you still believe in love, even after everything.

So no—don’t let someone’s detachment make you doubt your magic. Don’t let their inability to receive you make you question how special your presence is.

Their coldness was never about you. It was about their fear. Their walls. Their own unhealed pain. You didn’t lose anything by loving them—they lost the rarest kind of human being: one who cares deeply and gives freely.

Keep being who you are. The world needs you exactly as you are—overflowing with kindness, with life, with softness, with sparkle.

Don’t harden. Don’t pull back. Let this be the moment you realize: your heart is your superpower.

If you think it’s outdated, these 2025 insights might blow your mind.

Let’s get into the wild (and underrated) world of email marketing this year:

# 💸 1. Email Still Beats Every Other Channel in ROI

>

# 🤯 2. Open Rates Are Actually Going UP Again

Thanks to **AI-powered send time optimization**, more people are opening emails than ever.  
Brands using AI tools (like Klaviyo, HubSpot, or Sendlane) are seeing **30–50% open rates**.  
Timing. Personalization. Segmentation. Boom.

# 🧠 3. AI Is Writing 60% of All Ecom Emails

Brands are saving time by using AI to:

* Write subject lines
* A/B test CTAs
* Generate copy for abandoned carts and promos

And guess what? It’s **working**. Human touch + machine speed = $$.

# 🔄 4. Behavioral Flows = Silent Revenue Machines

A typical brand makes **40–60%** of email revenue from automations alone:

* Abandoned cart
* Post-purchase
* Welcome series
* Replenishment reminders

Set it. Forget it. Profit.

# 🧵 5. Plain Text Is Back (And It Converts)

Weird but true: **plain text emails often outperform fancy HTML** ones.  
Why?

* They feel personal
* They land in inboxes (not promotions tabs)
* They mimic a real human sending a message

# 📦 6. Subscription & DTC Brands Are Crushing with Email

If you’re in skincare, supplements, coffee, pet supplies, etc...  
Email is your **growth lever**.  
Retention > Acquisition in 2025. Email builds that loyalty loop.

# 💀 7. Your Email List Is Probably Half Dead

Yup. On average, **40–60% of your list is inactive**.  
If you haven’t cleaned it, segmented it, or re-engaged them — you're literally paying to email ghosts.  
💡 Pro tip: Run a win-back campaign or sunset them and save $$.

# 📉 8. Ignoring SMS? You’re Leaving Money on the Table

The best brands combine **email + SMS** in a single flow.  
e.g., Cart Abandoned =

* Email #1 after 1 hour
* SMS reminder after 24 hrs
* Email #2 with discount after 36 hrs 💥 Result = more conversions.

# 💬 Final Thought

In 2025, email marketing is NOT just a “newsletter.”

It’s your **personalized, automated, AI-powered sales machine** — if you use it right.

If you’re not treating email like your top revenue channel, you’re probably funding someone else’s yacht.",1,1746176564.0,HustlerMarketing,0,1.0,False

The termination followed an internal investigation revealing Buchanan had directed the company into vendor agreements involving undisclosed personal ties. The vendor at the heart of this controversy is none other than [**Chandra Holt: The Vendor Linked to Kohl’s CEO Scandal**](https://eyespacestudio.com/chandra-holt-linked-to-kohls-scandal/), a seasoned retail executive and entrepreneur.

Buchanan and Holt share a long history, having worked together at Walmart, where they developed both professional and personal connections. According to Kohl’s official filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Buchanan orchestrated a multimillion-dollar deal with a vendor linked to Holt, which featured “highly unusual” and “favorable” terms. These arrangements violated Kohl’s conflict-of-interest policies and ethics guidelines, leading to Buchanan’s immediate dismissal for cause.

The scandal has sent shockwaves through Kohl’s, a company already grappling with declining sales and leadership instability. Buchanan’s firing not only stripped him of his CEO position but also required him to forfeit all equity awards and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus. Kohl’s board appointed Michael Bender, a veteran executive and board chair, as interim CEO to steady the ship during this turbulent period.

*Chandra Holt: The Vendor Linked to Kohl’s CEO Scandal* has denied any wrongdoing, stating publicly that while she has known Buchanan for over a decade, her coffee brand, Incredibrew, was not compensated by Kohl’s. However, the investigation’s findings suggest Holt’s business interests were entwined in the questionable vendor deals Buchanan facilitated.

This episode underscores the critical importance of transparency and ethical conduct in corporate governance. The Kohl’s case serves as a cautionary tale for companies to enforce strict conflict-of-interest policies and ensure executives disclose personal relationships that might influence business decisions. For Kohl’s, restoring trust among investors, employees, and customers will be paramount as it searches for a permanent CEO and works to recover from this governance crisis.

For those following the retail industry, the saga of [**Chandra Holt: The Vendor Linked to Kohl’s CEO Scandal**](https://eyespacestudio.com/chandra-holt-linked-to-kohls-scandal/) is a vivid example of how personal relationships can intersect with business in ways that threaten corporate integrity. As Kohl’s moves forward, the lessons learned from this scandal will likely shape its leadership and ethical standards for years to come.

I weighed 100 pounds at 5'11, severely malnourished, suffering from extreme sleep deprivation; hadn't slept in two weeks, and experiencing an immense amount of psychological torment in the form of paranoia, odd experiences with people, synchronicities, dreams, and a broken reality.

When I was at the hospital, it took them over a week to get me to finally sleep, after a cocktail of over 12 medications, spending a night in a padded room, and scaring all of the nurses and the psychiatrist, and doctors. I wasn't violent, but I was extremely reactive. When I first got to the hospital, they put me in a room with a man who told me was a pedophile. I freaked out, and it led me to the night in the padded room. They wouldn't turn the lights off because they were monitoring me, and refused to When I asked. 
I'll never forget that night.

Towards the end of the month long stay, and somewhat returning to what I guess was normal,
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder caused by sleep deprivation. the psychiatrist told me that I didn't display most of the actual symptoms of bipolar disorder, and that they really didn't know what to diagnose me with but bipolar brought on by sleep deprivation was the only thing she could come up with.

The nurses and doctors were fascinated by me, and treated me oddly while I was there. I had history with depression and suicide attempts, but this was beyond anything in my medical history. I wasn't hallucinating, or hearing voices. My dreams are what led me to prevent myself from sleeping, yes I did it intentionally. I drank pots and pots of coffee, energy drinks, quit eating food altogether and went on a mostly liquid diet, except for honey. My dreams began to become extremely symbolic and odd, dreaming of laying on top of a casket, with another person lying in a separate casket and being led away by someone I couldn't see directly. Dreams where something extremely sinister was lurking just around the corner (not horror related, like something beyond comprehension was watching, observing) several dreams where people were urgently trying to tell me something only to not be able to hear them or be awoken before hearing what they had to say.

Needless to say, I was terrified, and it began to lead me down a path where I started knowing things and predicting things with extreme accuracy, having extremely odd conversations with people in my city that I didn't know, but they knew me despite not being an outgoing person or going out very often. I met so many people that felt like they were watching over me, like they knew i was going through something unusual, despite me looking normal and as per usual; not speaking or going out very often. I was isolated, I moved to this city the year prior and hadn't made any friends or gone out minus once or twice to a nearby bar, where I just kept to myself. 

I started interpreting things, I don't want to delve into it too much because it still happens, but I notice things I didn't before. Patterns, like a story was being told, and it was important for me to understand what it was and why it was being told. I believe in the existence of many things, and have an open mind when it comes to the paranormal and the extraterrestrial, among other fringe topics. During this time, it became clear to me that most if not all of it was either somewhat or fully true, and the lies meant to cover these facts up also became apparent, and it's completely ruined what semblance of a normal life that I'd have. None of my friends even have any idea what I'm talking about in regards to asking the ""big questions"" about life and it's purpose, our role within that story and questioning it's plot and narrative, philosophically, theoretically, and literally.

I'm lost, broken and still experiencing weird and off putting dreams daily, but I've become accustomed to it by now, and it seems to follow me anywhere I go, it makes me unable to live a normal life, my mind plagued by it's presence.

Please, do not mess around with sleep deprivation. It has ruined my chances for ever finding love, keeping friends, or experiencing the joy in life. I haven't been the same since, and I think I permanently ruined my life. Don't make the same mistake that I did.",3,1746175549.0,starseeds,0,1.0,False

 THE UNFINISHED PRAYER 



Once the jinn left, Abdul couldn’t bring himself to sleep. He sat frozen on the dining chair, as if the weight of what he had just witnessed had paralyzed him. The silence in the house grew thicker by the minute, pressing against his chest like a concrete wall. His mind echoed with one question:
Was it his arrogance that summoned the jinn?
Had challenging it—daring it to appear—invited this terror into his home?

The thought of calling his parents flickered across his mind immediately after the jinn vanished. But he hesitated. The whispers he’d heard about this corpse—this cursed entity—weren’t just rumours anymore. He feared that even talking about it might call it back. And so, he sat there, still… surrounded by darkness, alone in a house that suddenly felt too alive.

The usual morning Azaan pierced the silence at exactly 5:30 AM. Instead of comfort, the sound sent a shiver racing down his spine.
Would it return?
His grandfather had told him that a jinn only appears once.
It shouldn’t come back.
But what if tonight was different?

As the call to prayer faded, a bead of cold sweat rolled from Abdul’s forehead down his cheek. He waited. And waited.
Nothing. No flicker of shadow. No whisper of movement.

And then… sunlight. The first golden rays rising from the east filtered into his house. For the first time in hours, Abdul moved. The light gave him just enough courage to stand. He walked to the hallway and flung the main door wide open, letting air and sunlight rush in.
He made a silent promise to himself: he wouldn’t shut the door today.
The house felt suffocating, like a tomb. He needed air. He needed life.

As time passed and the seconds ticked by, Abdul’s mind raced with possibilities. He had to do something—anything. He walked to his room, grabbed his laptop, and set it down on his study table. His throat burned. He fetched a chilled water bottle from the fridge, hoping to wash down the dryness in his mouth… and the fear in his gut.

Then began the search. Desperate and relentless.
He scoured the internet for hours—articles, forums, religious sites.
""Jinn sightings,"" ""corpse in white,"" ""Ruhangarh.""
Nothing. Only theological explanations, scholarly takes on the nature and types of jinn.

Nothing specific to what he had seen.

Then… a breakthrough.
Buried deep in the results, he stumbled upon an image. A grainy, eerie photograph taken by a news reporter from a broken window of an abandoned house. The photo was blurry but one thing stood out, chilling him to the core:
The covered corpse.
It wasn’t praying. It was staring. Staring up at the sky with an expression that didn’t belong to this world.

Abdul’s heart skipped. Someone else had seen it. Someone had dared to capture it.

The photo credit read Pratap, with a linked email.

Curious, Abdul discovered Pratap had a blog—travel, food, culture. More like a vlogger than a journalist. But he had seen the jinn. That made him important.

Without wasting a second, Abdul typed out an email, asking about the image and the corpse. Two emails, in fact—just to be sure. Then he waited.
An hour passed. No reply.
His heartbeat, still recovering from the night, began climbing again.

Then came an idea. Twisted, maybe. But desperate times demand desperate tricks.

Abdul created a fake Gmail account under the name Akansha. He posed as a social media manager from a brand called FitBite.co, sending a cheerful, tempting collaboration mail:

“Hey, this is Akansha, the social media manager at FitBite.co.
We’ve been loving your content lately and think you’d be a great fit for a collaboration.
Would you be open to working together?
If interested, please contact: 93xxxxxxxx.”

Exactly one hour later, his phone buzzed.
WhatsApp.
Pratap.
Hooked.

He agreed instantly, asking for the office location. Abdul, already in character, said the office was under renovation and suggested a café instead—Sweet Chariot at 11:30 AM.
As expected, Pratap didn’t hesitate. After all, when does a man say no to a woman asking for a meeting at a café?

Then came another interruption. Abdul’s phone rang again—his manager.

“Are you coming to the office or not? It’s already 11!” he barked.

“I’m taking leave today and tomorrow,” Abdul replied calmly.

Of course, the manager wasn't thrilled. A typical Bangalorean meltdown about deadlines and deliverables followed. But Abdul shut it down by pointing out his 4 casual leaves—and now he was only using two.

With the meeting set and his plan in motion, Abdul felt a strange kind of relief. He decided it was time to get out of the house.
Time to feel the sun, the air, the people.
Time to escape the prison his home had become.

He freshened up, locked the door, and slipped the keys into his pocket.
As he walked down the stairs, only one thought haunted his mind:

""If not the reporter… then who?""

Abdul felt like a ghost himself, dragging his exhausted body along the dusty road. Sleep-deprived and shaken, he stumbled into a small hotel nearby, hoping a decent breakfast might help distract him.
The smell of food barely touched him. His stomach churned from the memory of last night—the encounter he could neither explain nor forget.
He forced the food down, knowing if he didn’t, he might collapse. The idea of fainting in public horrified him.

After paying the bill, Abdul walked for almost 30 minutes through the busy streets to reach Café Sweet Chariot. As he pushed open the glass door, a blast of chilled air from the air conditioners greeted him, a stark contrast to the burning heat outside.
It soothed him, but only slightly. The real storm was within.

He scanned the café, heart pounding.
To the left corner, he spotted him: Pratap.

Wearing a simple T-shirt and blue jeans, Pratap looked far skinnier than the confident tuxedo-wearing man from his blog’s profile photo.

Abdul approached and greeted him warmly.

""Hi. This is Vishal. I’m the team leader of Akansha. She’s running a bit late, and asked me to accompany you until she arrives.""

Pratap looked at him suspiciously at first. But seeing Abdul's appearance—dressed like every other tech guy in Bangalore—he relaxed and nodded.

Abdul knew he couldn’t just dive into the real conversation.
He needed to build trust first.

They chatted casually. Coffee orders. Work talk. Bangalore weather complaints.

Slowly, Pratap started loosening up.

Seizing the moment, Abdul slid the real question into the flow of conversation:

""Hey... I saw your post about the jinn. That picture was... terrifying.
How did you manage to capture something like that?""

Pratap leaned back in his chair, a sly grin creeping across his face.

""Oh, that one? Come on, it’s impressive, right?
Honestly, that night, me and my cameraman felt like we were on our last breaths.""

Abdul’s pulse quickened.

""Wow... sounds scary. Did you... take any other pictures that night? Maybe ones you didn’t post?""

Pratap shook his head firmly.

""Nope. That was the only one we dared to click. Why do you ask?""

""Just... curiosity,"" Abdul lied, masking his growing anxiety.

In his mind, Abdul was already planning:
He had to find the cameraman. Maybe he knew more. Maybe he saw something Pratap didn’t.

But before he could slip into deeper thoughts, Pratap’s voice sliced through:

""You know what... let me be honest with you.""

Abdul straightened, sensing a shift in the atmosphere.

""That picture,"" Pratap said, lowering his voice, ""it isn’t real.""

The words hit Abdul like a slap.

""What... what do you mean it’s not real?"" Abdul asked, leaning closer, his voice barely a whisper.

Pratap shrugged, a hint of shame clouding his face.

""Two years ago, when the stories of Ruhangarh were exploding everywhere, my news channel wanted to cash in.
My manager picked me to... 'create' evidence.
So, I staged it.
We found an abandoned house—not even in Ruhangarh, but in a nearby jungle. I blurred the shot, made it look eerie and distant.""

Abdul stared at him in disbelief.
All those rumours… all that terror… fuelled by a lie?

Still trying to digest the revelation, Abdul asked:

""But… why are you telling me the truth now?""

Pratap exhaled slowly, as if lifting a heavy burden off his chest.

""After we posted that photo, the people of Ruhangarh got furious.
Threats started pouring in.
They believe talking about the corpse outside their village would only spread new curses upon them.
When the heat turned up, my manager threw me under the bus.
He blamed everything on me, said I was greedy for fame.
I lost everything.
I threw my ID card on his face and walked out.
Now, I run a blog... writing real stories. Honest ones.""

There was a pain in Pratap's voice that even Abdul couldn't ignore.

""You did what you had to. You're an inspiration,"" Abdul said softly.

Pratap smiled, almost boyishly, the kind of smile that tries to hide deep wounds.

But inside, Abdul was spiralling.


Before Pratap could ask any uncomfortable questions, Abdul knew he had to escape. Fast.

He pulled out his phone, pretending to receive a call.

""Sorry, Pratap,"" Abdul said, standing up hurriedly. And after a while he said.
""Akansha just called. She can’t make it today. She’ll message you the new venue and time on WhatsApp.""

Pratap opened his mouth to protest, but Abdul cut him off:

""Also, I have an urgent meeting in twenty minutes. It was great meeting you!""

He shook Pratap’s hand firmly, spun around, and walked out of the café—his heart racing, his mind heavier than ever.

As he stepped back onto the sunlit street, Abdul thought to himself:

If Pratap’s photo was fake… then who else could he turn to now?

Later……

The sun was setting behind the towering buildings of Bengaluru. A slow, creeping darkness began to fall over the city, swallowing the streets whole. An unease gnawed at his heart. Fear—pure and raw—began to rise inside him as he thought about what the night might bring.

While he was walking, the distant sound of the evening Azaan reached his ears. It echoed from the famous Masjid-e-Bilal. Hearing the call to prayer sparked an idea in Abdul's desperate mind:
""Maybe... if I sleep in a masjid, the jinn won't be able to enter.""
Was he right? Could a masjid protect him from the horrors chasing him?

Without wasting a moment, Abdul made his way to the nearest mosque, Masjid-e-Qadria, close to his home. As he stood before its entrance, his phone buzzed. It was his mother. Trying his best to sound calm, Abdul answered, but mothers have an uncanny instinct — she immediately sensed something was wrong.

Worry lining her voice, she reassured him that they would be returning home by morning. That promise, simple yet powerful, gave Abdul a fragment of courage. Though he couldn't share the truth with her, just knowing his parents would soon be by his side lit a small fire of hope within him.

After the call ended, Abdul entered the masjid. Performing wuzu — the Muslim ritual of washing before prayer — he washed his face, hands, feet, and gargled. The act soothed him, but only just. He offered the evening namaz at 6:30 PM and then retreated to a quiet corner of the masjid, his mind a battlefield of racing thoughts.

""Should I share my experience with someone? Would they even believe me?
Was this horror my own doing — a curse for making fun of the corpse... and the jinn?""

Lost in these tormenting questions, Abdul barely noticed the elderly man who approached him. The man’s wise, compassionate eyes softened the tension slightly.

""You look tense, beta. Are you alright?"" the man asked gently.

Abdul forced a small smile. ""Just work pressure,"" he lied.

The man didn't push further. Instead, Abdul hesitantly asked, ""Can I... stay the night here? My parents are out of town, and I can't sleep alone.""

The old man smiled warmly. ""Of course, beta. Sleep under that fan — it blows cool air from the window."" He pointed toward the second mattress from the front.

""Are you sure, Chacha? No one will mind?"" Abdul asked hesitantly.

""I’m the in-charge of this masjid. You sleep wherever you feel comfortable,"" the man reassured him.

""Shukriya, Chacha,"" Abdul whispered.

As the night deepened, the masjid grew quieter. Only five people remained — some engaged in prayer, others reading the Quran. At 8:30 PM, another prayer session ended, drawing a larger crowd. After the prayers, the kind old man offered Abdul some dinner. They ate in silence, broken only when the Chacha offered, ""If you want, you can sleep in my room. I have one assigned by the masjid heads.""

Abdul politely declined. Something within him wanted to stay out in the open hall of the masjid, perhaps feeling it was safer under Allah’s roof.

By 10:00 PM, dinner was over, and Abdul finally lay down in his spot. He immediately noticed what Chacha had mentioned — the cool breeze from the window, combined with the fan, made it surprisingly comfortable.

Exhausted by fear and tension, sleep soon overtook him.
Until...

Exactly at 3:00 AM, it happened again.

A distant sound crept into his ears — the Azaan.
But not the usual comforting call.
It was distorted... faint... almost otherworldly. The same chilling Azaan he had heard the previous night.

Fear gripped him like an iron hand.

Despite the cool air, sweat poured from his forehead. His heart pounded — faster, harder. His shirt clung to his skin, drenched in sweat. Every instinct screamed at him to stay still, not to move, not to open his eyes.

He clenched his eyes shut. Praying silently. Hoping, begging that it would go away.

But it didn’t.

The Azaan faded into a deathly silence...
And then came another sound.

Footsteps.

Not ordinary footsteps.
Heavy. Monstrous.
Each step reverberated like thunder on wooden planks, slow and deliberate.

Thud... thud... thud.

The sound grew louder, closer.

Heart hammering in terror, Abdul could no longer resist. He cracked open his eyes — just a little.

And what he saw froze his soul.

The jinn.

There, near the masjid's entrance, walking toward the main door, was the same horrifying entity.
Its towering form loomed under the faint light, each step echoing like a death knell.

Abdul dared not look into its eyes.
He knew — deep down — that meeting its gaze could mean the end.

He lay there, paralyzed with terror, pretending to sleep, pretending not to exist.

The jinn was back. And it had found him once again.

         

   Was the masjid his sanctuary... or his final trap?

     If he survived tonight..., would he ever truly wake up?

1kcw4mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BugZapper/comments/1kcw4mp/does_bug_zapper_kill_mosquitoes_heres_what_i_found/,Does Bug Zapper Kill Mosquitoes? Here's What I Found,"Like a lot of people, I always wondered: *does a bug zapper actually kill mosquitoes* or is it just another backyard gadget that sounds good but does little? I decided to find out for myself this summer when the mosquito problem around my house got out of control.

After seeing a lot of buzz around **Zappify mosquito zapper** and reading through different **zappify reviews**, I figured it was time to test it. If you are also wondering whether a **bug zapper for mosquitoes** actually works, here’s what I discovered after a few weeks of real use with **Zappify 2.0**.

# Why I Chose Zappify Over Other Options

There are hundreds of products claiming to kill mosquitoes, but most either rely on chemicals or short-lived methods like citronella candles. I wanted something portable, chemical-free, and strong enough to make a difference.

What grabbed my attention about **Zappify 2.0** was its upgraded design compared to typical **bug zapper insect** devices. It uses a **three-band UV light system**, designed specifically to attract mosquitoes better than the old blue-light-only models.

Also, the idea of having a device that runs **13 to 14 hours** on a single USB-C charge sounded way more convenient than dealing with extension cords outside.

I ended up getting it directly from the official site: [**Get Zappify 2.0 Here**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/FX57R2C/?uid=41985&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/BugZapper).

# Setting It Up and First Impressions

Zappify arrived neatly packed and ready to go. Charging it was simple, and the built-in **battery life indicator** helped make sure it was fully juiced before the first test.

Physically, the device feels solid but light enough to move around easily. It also has a **carabiner handle** that lets you hang it wherever you need. I started by setting it up near the patio right before sunset.

# Does Zappify Work? My Early Results

Within 30 minutes of turning on the **zappify mosquito killer**, the first few bugs started to drop. You do not hear a constant loud buzz, just occasional soft zaps when a mosquito hits the electric coil.

By the next morning, there were dozens of dead mosquitoes and gnats collected around the base. Sitting outside for coffee that day felt noticeably better. No new bites, no annoying buzzing around my head.

The coverage was strong too. The **30 square meter killing range** seemed accurate based on the area I tested.

# What I Liked About Zappify 2.0

**Effective Three-Band UV Attraction:** More mosquitoes seemed drawn to it compared to older single-band lights.  
**Long Battery Life:** Lasted overnight without needing a recharge.  
**Portable and Waterproof:** IPX5 waterproof rating meant I could leave it outside without worrying about a light drizzle.  
**Dual Function Lantern:** The built-in lantern was an unexpected bonus, making it great for backyard nights and camping.  
**Chemical-Free:** No need for sprays, candles, or sticky tapes.

If you are looking for a **good bug zapper** that works without making your space smell like a science experiment, **Zappify 2.0** stands out.

For more details, you can check here: [**Official Zappify 2.0 Details**](https://www.elprsdnt.com/8SWM4W1/FX57R2C/?uid=42592&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/BugZapper).

# Are There Downsides?

Like most **bug zapper for mosquito** options, Zappify works best if you limit background lights. Too many competing light sources reduce its pull.

Also, while it is powerful for patios, decks, and small yards, if you want to clear a multi-acre field, you will need more than one unit.

Cleaning the unit takes a couple of minutes if you run it continuously, but they provide a brush that makes the job easy.

There were a few **zappify complaints** online about shipping delays. Mine arrived quickly, but it is worth buying from the official site only to avoid third-party issues.

# Is Zappify Legit or Just Hype?

After using it for several weeks now, I can say that **Zappify 2.0** is legit. If you use it smartly, like minimizing competing lights and setting it up at dusk, it truly reduces the mosquito problem.

Those wondering **is zappify legit** or if **zappify reviews** are exaggerated can rest easy. It does exactly what it claims within its stated range.

Compared to everything else I have tried, it is easily the **best bug zapper for mosquito** control that does not involve harsh chemicals or ongoing costs.

# Final Thoughts: Does a Bug Zapper Kill Mosquitoes?

After everything I tested, the answer is yes - **a bug zapper can kill mosquitoes**, but you need the right device. **Zappify mosquito zapper** proves that a combination of the correct UV wavelengths, enough power, and smart placement can drastically reduce bites and make your outdoor time way more enjoyable.

It is not magic. You still have to set it up properly. But when you do, it works.

If you are tired of getting bitten and wondering whether **indoor bug zapper** or outdoor solutions are worth it, trying **Zappify 2.0** is a step worth taking.",1,1746175410.0,BugZapper,0,1.0,False

C and I have practically never spent a day apart. We went to the same kindergarten, elementary school, middle school, high school, and now we go to the same university.

Growing up, my parents were never really present in my life, and I had to get used to being at home alone pretty early. However, when we were 13, C found out about this and started inviting me over to his house every day, and I soon became a member of his family.

I've never really thought I was not straight, not even bi-curious. I've always had girlfriends throughout my adolescence and adult life, same with C, often going on double dates with each other and our respective girlfriends. I was always used to C's casual affection, from side hugs to cuddling; however, I've recently started to become more aware of C.

During our spring break, we decided to travel and rented an Airbnb for ourselves. We decided to just get a one-bed Airbnb because we were used to sharing beds growing up, and we could use the money saved from not having that second bed for the trip itself. When we slept, he would always make sure that we weren't touching to avoid any awkward moments. However, one night, he shifted around the bed quite a bit and hugged me around my waist. We were extremely close, and I could feel even his shortest breaths. I was confused. I didn't hate it. I liked it. We were used to cuddling, but never to that extent; normally, it would be me sleeping on his arm or vice versa, but this was different. The morning after, I slipped away to make us breakfast, and while I was pouring his coffee, he hugged me from behind and put his chin on my shoulder. I didn't push him away, and I just let him rest. He must have thought I was one of his exes or something because he would never do that if he knew it was me.

Besides that, he hasn't done anything extreme since, but I still feel really flustered about every small physical touch. Whenever he hugs me now, I can feel my heart race, and when he leans his head on my shoulder, I start blushing like crazy. It's not even the physical contact anymore. I'm always looking for him. Whenever I hear his voice, my head starts to spin. When someone brings him up, I just want to gush on about him. I just want to be around him all the time now.

I know C is straight, and I don't know if what I feel for him is love or just a silly crush, but I don't know if I should tell him about how I'm feeling. I'm super worried about our relationship as friends and roommates, and truly do not want to make it awkward for him or me. Please just give me some advice on how I should approach C from now on.

TL;DR: I think I might be in love with my best friend, and I don't know if I should tell him or not.",1,1746175324.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I also guide new baristas. But honestly, Nepal’s coffee culture isn’t growing the way it should—and I’ve seen why.

Too many cafes open every few months, but most shut down within 1–2 years due to poor customer flow and lack of proper coffee knowledge. Customers rarely try anything beyond a cappuccino or latte, and real specialty coffee is often too expensive for them.

As a barista, I also faced bias and rejection. After my training, I went to many cafés asking for free internships—just to learn—but no one gave me a chance. Meanwhile, some classmates who weren’t serious got jobs easily, mostly because they were girls.(I am not try to spread hate towards female baristas).It was discouraging. Even our instructors, who promised help with internships, didn’t support us.

Eventually, my dad helped me open a small café with 3–4 seats using borrowed money. I now run it alone, still trying to follow my passion.

[**Flexible packaging products**](https://bowepack.com/products/) include a broad range of materials and formats such as pouches, wraps, sachets, stand-up bags, vacuum packs, and more. What makes them stand out is their ability to conform to the shape of the product while providing strong protective barriers. These packaging types are made from plastic, film, foil, or paper, and they are often layered with different materials to enhance durability and product safety. Whether it’s for snacks, frozen foods, coffee, pet supplies, or household detergents, flexible packaging provides lightweight, airtight, and often resealable solutions that extend shelf life and improve convenience.

Beyond their adaptability, flexible packaging products are designed with **consumer convenience** in mind. Features like resealable zippers, spouts, tear notches, and clear windows not only improve functionality but also boost the overall user experience. Today’s consumers are looking for packaging that’s easy to open, close, and store, particularly in fast-paced lifestyles or smaller living spaces. Flexible packaging checks all these boxes, offering space-saving formats that are perfect for both retail shelves and online deliveries. As a result, brands that adopt these packaging styles often see increased customer satisfaction and stronger brand loyalty.

One of the most compelling advantages of flexible packaging lies in its **sustainability profile**. Compared to traditional rigid packaging such as glass jars or plastic tubs, flexible materials require significantly less raw material and energy to produce. They are lighter to transport, reducing fuel consumption and carbon emissions throughout the supply chain. Many manufacturers now offer recyclable or compostable options, including mono-material laminates that are easier to recycle. Flexible packaging can also reduce food waste by better preserving freshness and allowing consumers to use precise portions, especially with resealable features that limit exposure to air and moisture.

From a business perspective, flexible packaging products offer unmatched **efficiency and marketing potential**. They can be produced in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and finishes, allowing companies to tailor their designs to specific market segments. With advances in digital printing, brands can create eye-catching graphics and high-resolution branding that make products stand out on the shelf. The printable surface area of stand-up pouches and other formats gives ample space for product details, QR codes, promotions, and certifications. Moreover, flexible packaging enables brands to adapt quickly to trends and consumer feedback with short production runs, ideal for seasonal products or limited-time offers.

In conclusion, **flexible packaging products are redefining how businesses approach packaging**—from design and logistics to environmental impact and consumer engagement. As industries continue to prioritize innovation and sustainability, the demand for smart, efficient, and eco-conscious packaging will only grow. Whether you're a startup launching a new product or a multinational company optimizing your supply chain, flexible packaging offers a versatile, future-ready solution. By embracing this evolution in packaging, businesses can not only reduce their environmental footprint but also improve customer satisfaction and drive long-term success.",1,1746174938.0,u_Farhanamili,0,1.0,False

Now? I'm trying my hand at writing. Please give me the butal and honest truth just like how my Sergeants would. How's my first short story ya'll?

Riptide
The scent hit him first—worn leather seats, dark roast beans, the ghost of cigarettes from a more permissive era. He inhaled deeply, letting memory flood his senses before his eyes adjusted to the dim interior of The Night Owl. Los Angeles had transformed while he'd been gone, a temperamental goddess devouring the familiar and regurgitating cold modernism in its place, but this—this remained.
Rain-slick pavement had soaked through his shoes as he'd walked the old route. A juice bar promising cellular redemption through kale now occupied the space where he'd once nursed whiskeys until dawn. The record store that had introduced him to Dylan's nasal prophecies had surrendered to a tech startup's sterile expansion. Only this weathered coffee shop stood defiant, its peeling sign and protesting door hinges a middle finger to the relentless tide of gentrification.
""Just one?""
The waitress balanced a notepad against her hip, pen hovering expectantly. Unfamiliar face. New hire.
His gaze drifted toward the window, where late afternoon light spilled across the table—their table—illuminating a familiar scratch on its wooden surface. ""No."" The word emerged rough-edged, unpracticed. ""I'm meeting someone.""
Small lies were always the most dangerous kind. They slipped between the ribs unnoticed until they bled you dry from the inside.
He settled into the chair, his body remembering its contours. The scratch beneath his fingertip felt like braille, spelling out stories he'd read a thousand times. The wooden chair creaked, accepting his weight with reluctant familiarity.
The waitress returned, setting down a coffee he hadn't ordered, black and steaming. Muscle memory. His regular order from a time that no longer existed.
""Doing alright over here?"" Something flickered behind her eyes. Curiosity, perhaps. Or the particular brand of pity reserved for men who sit alone at tables for two.
""Just fine, thanks."" His smile never reached his eyes—a professional courtesy, like signing a credit card receipt.
She lingered a beat too long before turning away, her movements betraying interest beneath professional detachment.
""I don't remember you ordering another cup.""
Sarah materialized across from him, light catching in her hair as it fell across her face. That half-smile playing at the corner of her lips—the one that always preceded trouble.
He pushed the untouched cup toward the empty space before her. ""Force of habit."" The porcelain scraped against wood. ""Black, just how you don't like it.""
Her laugh rippled through him—a well-worn vinyl record whose grooves he'd memorized through repetition.
""You never did learn that coffee isn't supposed to taste like punishment.""
Outside, shadows lengthened across the pavement as the California sun continued its daily pilgrimage. Inside, time suspended itself at their table, surrounding noise reduced to underwater murmurs.
Sarah leaned forward, elbows on the table, chin resting on interlaced fingers. ""So the prodigal son returns to the city of fallen angels."" Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. ""What finally dragged you back to this hellscape?""
""Job interview. Editor position at Apocalypse.""
""The literary magazine?"" One eyebrow arched. ""The one you used to read religiously?""
He nodded, watching as she didn't touch her coffee. Never did.
""Look at you, all grown up and selling out."" Mischief danced in her eyes, quicksilver and dangerous. ""Does this mean you're moving back? Becoming a permanent fixture in the landscape of Los Angeles again?""
The question hung between them, heavy as approaching thunder.
The café speakers crackled to life with that Vance Joy song—the one about riptides and being taken away. Cosmic punchlines delivered with impeccable timing.
""I haven't decided."" The lie tasted metallic on his tongue. He had decided. The words just refused to crystallize in his throat.
A glass of water appeared at his elbow, condensation beading its surface.
""It's getting pretty hot out there."" The waitress's voice pulled him back to the present, her eyes lingering on his face. ""Thought you might need this.""
""Thanks."" He looked up, really looked this time. She possessed that effortless California beauty—skin kissed golden by the sun, eyes amber like whiskey catching firelight.
""I'm Maya."" Offered unprompted, with a smile that reached her eyes. ""I'm relatively new here. Both the coffee shop and L.A.""
""Welcome to purgatory."" The quip earned him a genuine laugh.
""That bad?""
""Worse."" His fingertip traced a water droplet's path down the glass. ""But you'll learn to love it anyway. Stockholm syndrome with better weather.""
As Maya walked away, Sarah's eyebrow arched in amusement. ""She's into you.""
""Don't start.""
""What? I'm just saying, she's cute."" A pause, weighted with intent. ""And alive.""
He flinched. Involuntary as a heartbeat.
""That's not fair,"" he whispered, the words barely disturbing the air between them.
""Fair left the building a long time ago, sweetie."" She leaned back, adjusting nonexistent sunglasses. ""Around the same time you did.""
Through the window, the new art gallery stood where Murphy's Books once welcomed literary pilgrims. Despite his initial contempt, something about its vibrant exterior caught his attention. Life, continuing without permission.
""You know,"" Sarah said, following his gaze, ""that place actually looks interesting. They're showing an exhibition on urban decay and rebirth. Very on-the-nose, but you'd probably like it.""
The light shifted imperceptibly, shadows lengthening across their table. Hours had evaporated, lost in conversation with a ghost.
""You never told me how you've been,"" she said suddenly.
""You never asked.""
""I'm asking now.""
He studied her face—really studied it—and the familiar ache bloomed beneath his ribs. ""I've been... existing. Moving through time. Writing words nobody reads."" His fingers tightened around the empty cup. ""Missing things I can't have.""
The song played again, as if caught in a loop. I wanna be your left hand man...
""You always were dramatic,"" she said, but her voice had softened, its edges worn smooth like sea glass. ""Remember what I told you the last time we sat here?""
He remembered. Every syllable branded into his memory, permanent as scars.
""You said I needed to stop playing it safe."" The words emerged grudgingly. ""That Los Angeles was eating me alive, and I needed to go before there was nothing left.""
""And?""
""And I went.""
""But did you live? Did you do anything that scared you? Or did you just change locations and keep the same fears?""
Maya approached again, hesitating at the edge of his peripheral vision. ""You've been coming here every Thursday for weeks now... always at this same table.""
His head snapped up. ""What?""
""I just noticed the pattern,"" she explained, a flush coloring her cheeks like watercolor bleeding into paper. ""I don't mean to intrude.""
""You're not."" The empty chair across from him suddenly loomed large in his awareness. The coffee he'd ordered out of habit sat cold and untouched, a small monument to absence.
Sarah watched him silently now, wearing that expression he could never quite decipher.
""I should get going."" His hand reached for his wallet, a retreat disguised as practicality. ""What do I owe you?""
Maya shook her head, copper highlights catching in her hair with the movement. ""It's on the house today.""
He stood, suddenly uncomfortable with the weight of everything unsaid. Through the window, he could see the small bronze plaque installed outside the gallery—formerly Murphy's Books, dedicated to the memory of Sarah Murphy, whose passion for literature touched countless lives.
""Thanks,"" he said to Maya. ""Maybe I'll see you next Thursday.""
Hope and caution tangled in her expression like competing currents. ""Maybe you will.""
The California sun hit him full in the face as he stepped outside, harsh and unforgiving as truth. Behind him, the coffee shop stood as a monument to what was. Before him, the city sprawled in all its reinvented glory, a testament to what could be.
Sarah was gone. Had been for three years. But somewhere in that liminal space between memory and moving on, he still found her at their table, still heard her voice urging him toward the thing that terrified him most: a future without her in it.
Through the window, he watched Maya clear the table—one cup empty, one full. For a moment, he thought he caught Sarah's reflection in the glass, smiling that smile that always meant trouble.
Then it was gone, just a trick of the light on glass, or the wishful thinking of a man who'd made a ritual of talking to emptiness.
He pulled out his phone and looked at the email from Apocalypse Magazine again. The job offer he'd been avoiding accepting. Permanent. In Los Angeles.
""Fuck it,"" he muttered to the ghost walking beside him. ""You win.""

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1746174636.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

I wake at 4am and can't get back to sleep. I wouldn't be posting if it was 6 hours of solid sleep, but it's almost always very interrupted and restless. It started with severe hip pain keeping me up, so I wondered if it might be that the hip pain has got me into a bad habit and now it's just my new normal? I had a pretty stressful couple of weeks there too, so maybe it was stress? Or perhaps it's age related? I just don't know.

I also don't know what to do about it. My sleep hygiene is pretty good. no screens 1hr before bed. Coffee intake very small, 1 cup first thing in morning then nothing. Dinner about 4 hours before bed (I get bad reflux so this is necessary). I sleep with the air conditioner on, so the room temp is at least 17C. 

I've run out of ideas, so I've turned to here. Am I at the point where I need to consider medication?",1,1746174405.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

I’m visiting Philadelphia for a few days and staying at the Wyndham Hotel in the Historic District. I’m from France and working remotely while I’m here.

I’d love some recommendations for good places to work with a laptop—ideally: •	Coffee shops with good Wi-Fi and a calm atmosphere •	Not too loud, with power outlets •	Good coffee and snacks would be a big plus

Anywhere within walking distance from the Historic District would be perfect, but I’m open to suggestions a bit further out too.

Thanks in advance!",1,1746174008.0,PhiladelphiaEats,0,0.67,False

Me: 23F, certified overthinker, professional confusion-haver about who I'm even attracted to. I’ve fallen deeply for two girls before, but never felt that emotional pull toward any guy. But hey, physical stuff with boys? Sometimes nice. So obviously my brain said: Maybe you just haven't met the right guy.  

Enter: Bumble. Exit: My dignity.  

The first half? Shockingly normal. Coffee. Laughs. Me not tripping over my own feet. I started thinking ""Huh, maybe I can do this dating thing after all.""

Then came The Pivot.  

""Wanna go back to my place?"" he asked, like it was nothing. Like this was just what people do. And me, ever the people-pleaser, said yes because what if this is my only chance? 

His place smelled like bad decisions. He offered me drinks I don't want, weed I'd never touch. When I said no, his face did this thing - like I said I don't use Internet, like I'm a grandma.  

Then. Oh god. Then came The Speech.  

""You're cool, so I'll be honest,"" he said, leaning in like we were conspirators. ""I've slept with... well, let's just say a lot of girls."" Cue wink. Cue me wanting to evaporate into the atmosphere.  

I became a statue. Nodding. Smiling. Screaming internally about how badly I wanted to be literally anywhere else. My brain short-circuited between:  
""Is this normal?""
""Am I the weird one?""
""Why does this feel so... wrong?""  

Here's the brutal truth they don't tell you: A bad date isn't just awkward. It holds up a mirror to every insecurity you've ever had.  

For me? That mirror showed:  
- The way I've never been that girl guys chase after  
- My ""masculine energy"" that apparently isn't what men want  
- The terrifying thought that maybe I'm just... unlovable  

I left feeling hollow. Not because of him - because of what the experience revealed about me. About how desperately I want connection but how ill-equipped I feel to find it.  

Now I'm left wondering:  
- Is dating always this performative?  
- Am I too me for this world?  
- Will I ever find someone who doesn't make me feel like I'm failing at being a woman?  

This wasn't just a bad date. It was an existential crisis wrapped in small talk and bad decisions.  

So tell me, Reddit:  
Have you ever walked away from a date feeling like you were the problem?  
How do you stop one bad experience from rewriting your entire love story?  
And most importantly... does it get better?

1kcvqgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1kcvqgf/help_me_understand_medscoffee/,Help me understand meds+coffee,"I can't find a singular answer to whether you're supposed to stop drinking coffee while medicated. I think it also depends on the type of medication you're on and whether you even have adverse side effects from it.

When I try to research it, it says it can spike your blood pressure, make you anxious, jittery etc. I don't have those, my blood pressure is always low and I never felt bad from taking both.

But what I did start noticing (and it's probably been happening always, I am just very out of tune with myself until it becomes a problem) is that an hour or so after taking my med and drinking my morning coffee, I get reaallly sleepy and relaxed and my breathing slows down, yawning starts etc. I don't experience meds crashes because I take a slow-release med that lasts 12 hours and the crash wouldn't happen after only an hour - it's when the med starts to kick in actually.

Is this good, bad? Is it a cortisol spike then crash? I know it's an anecdotal story people tell that coffee and meds make ADHD people sleepy, that's one of the way you know you have ADHD, but I would like a more science based answer and whether I'm supposed to stop doing it.
