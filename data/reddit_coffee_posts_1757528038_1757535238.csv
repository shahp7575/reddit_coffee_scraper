Now I am 28 weeks pregnant with a girl and still can't give up coffee. I only have 1 small cup a day but if I skip that cup I get irritable and get a migraine. No judgement here just want to hear what other mom's out there can't live without during pregnancy. Stay strong mommas!! We keep going for our kids 💙💙🩷,1,1757535031.0,BabyBumps,1,1.0,False

I'm full of energy through the day, wake up feeling alert and fresh, don't have any energy crashes throughout the day etc but lately when I'm working out I feel like I'm running out of energy quickly. 

Haven't found any pre workout supplements etc that are carnivore friendly so far so wondering if anyone has any suggestions? I've started having some meat crisps an hour and a bit before I workout as well as electrolytes before and during and both seem to make a slight difference. I'm also one of those people who get tired after having coffee so unfortunately that isn't an option. ",1,1757534997.0,carnivorediet,0,1.0,False
1ndoww7,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1ndoww7/evaluate_the_best_single_serve_espresso_machine/,Evaluate the Best Single Serve Espresso Machine Breville Vertuo,"The Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville (Renewed) is the latest addition to my kitchen gadgetry, and I’ve been putting it through its paces over the past few weeks. As someone who thrives on multiple caffeine fixes a day, having a coffee machine that can meet all of my espresso and coffee needs while being user-friendly is a big deal. The Vertuo model certainly ticks a lot of boxes, but I wouldn’t call it perfect. Let me dive into the details of my experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me about this coffee machine is its sleek and minimalist black exterior. It’s a visually appealing addition to my kitchen countertop, blending nicely with other appliances without hogging too much space. Weighing roughly 11.43 pounds and measuring 10.75 x 14 x 14.5 inches, the compact size feels perfect for apartment kitchens or smaller spaces. The removable 40-ounce water tank is another touch of convenience, as it allows quick refilling without having to lug the entire machine to the sink. However, the plastic components don’t feel as premium as I’d hoped, especially for a product crafted by Breville, a brand typically associated with high-end kitchenware.  

**Performance and Brewing Versatility**  
This machine’s performance capabilities really shine, especially with its viable range of brewing options. Whether I wanted a quick espresso (1.35 oz.), a smooth gran lungo (5 oz.), or a towering Alto coffee (14 oz.), it delivered every time at the touch of a button. My favorite part is the versatility—it’s able to brew five different cup sizes effortlessly. I even experimented with pouring freshly brewed coffee over ice to make iced lattes, and the results were excellent. The machine reads the barcode on each Nespresso Vertuo capsule, ensuring that every cup is brewed with just the right amount of water, heat, and pressure. Still, the mandatory use of Vertuo capsules feels limiting, especially since I couldn’t test it with other capsule brands.

**[See Nespresso Vertuo Coffee and Espresso Machine by Breville deals on Amazon now.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b07qk26f64/)**  

**Ease of Use**  
True to its promise, the Vertuo machine is fully automatic and extremely easy to use. The single-touch button system is a blessing when I’m running late in the mornings. Set-up was surprisingly simple, too—it took only a few minutes from box to first brew. I also noticed how quickly it heated up—just 15 seconds from power-on to ready-to-use. The automatic shutdown feature after nine minutes of inactivity deserves a special shout-out, as it aligns with my goal of reducing energy usage wherever possible. Yet, I did find myself wishing for more customizable settings, especially regarding brew intensity and temperature.  

**Good Points**  
- Simple one-touch operation and fast heating time make it a time-saver.  
- Versatility in brewing allows for multiple coffee sizes suited to varied preferences.  
- Barista-grade results with consistently rich crema, thanks to Nespresso Centrifusion technology.  
- A removable 40 oz. water tank adds convenience, while the automatic shut-off boosts energy efficiency.  
- Compact and stylish design fits beautifully into any kitchen setup.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The machine only accepts Vertuo capsules, limiting coffee pod flexibility and leading to recurring costs.  
- Plastic components feel less robust compared to metal offerings from similar brands.  
- Lack of customizable brewing settings for users who prefer more control over flavor and strength.  

**Smart Features and Accessories**  
Breville didn’t skimp on the smart brewing technology here. I was fascinated to see how effortlessly the machine reads barcodes on capsules to fine-tune its brewing process. Every cup feels fresh, whether it’s a bold shot of espresso or a smooth long coffee. Additionally, the maker throws in a welcome set of 12 Vertuo capsules with unique aroma profiles, which helped me experiment with different flavors right out of the box. While it’s a thoughtful gesture, the absence of a carry pouch or storage compartment for the pods was a slight downside for me.  

**Market Rivals**  
Considering alternatives like Keurig K-Elite or De’Longhi Dedica Espresso Machine, the primary edge of the Vertuo Coffee Maker has to be its smart barcode-reading technology and brewing versatility. Unlike Keurig’s willingness to work with third-party coffee pods, the Vertuo holds you within its ecosystem, which can be frustrating for some users. Meanwhile, De’Longhi offers a more traditional espresso machine style with customizable controls, making it a better choice for serious coffee aficionados. However, the Vertuo pulls ahead with its ease of use, futuristic brewing, and quick results. It really comes down to what suits your lifestyle better—automation or customization.

**Affordable Quality**  
While the machine falls into a mid-range price category and may not be the cheapest coffee contraption out there, it certainly shows value for features that cater to quality and convenience. Its ability to replicate barista-like results at home is a big win, especially if you’re accustomed to spending on coffee shop visits. The recurring cost of proprietary capsules might seem like a drawback, but frequent promos and discounts online can soften the blow to your wallet. If a no-frills, consistent coffee maker is what you’re after, the Vertuo is worth considering.

When facing a mesothelioma diagnosis, your first instinct might be to search for “mesothelioma attorney near me” and choose whoever’s office is closest. It’s understandable – you’re already overwhelmed with medical appointments and treatments. Adding long drives to a law office seems like too much.



But choosing your mesothelioma attorney based solely on proximity could cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars in compensation.



The Million-Dollar Difference



The gap between an adequate local attorney and a specialized mesothelioma law firm can literally be measured in millions. While that lawyer downtown who handled your neighbor’s car accident might seem convenient, mesothelioma cases require deep knowledge of industrial history, asbestos products, complex medical evidence, and connections to national databases tracking corporate liability spanning decades.

The attorney ten minutes from your house might have handled two asbestos cases in their entire career. A national mesothelioma firm might have successfully resolved thousands.



Distance Doesn’t Matter Anymore



Today’s top mesothelioma law firms come to you – whether that’s your home, a local coffee shop, or even your hospital room. They handle depositions remotely, file documents electronically, and keep you updated through secure portals. You might never need to visit their office.



What matters isn’t their location, but whether they have decades of exclusive mesothelioma experience, access to national exposure databases, relationships with leading specialists, and proven multi-million dollar verdicts.



Ask the Right Questions



Instead of asking “Who’s closest?”, ask:

	•	Who has the best track record with cases like mine?

	•	Who has the resources to take on massive corporations?

	•	Who treats clients with genuine compassion?



Your mesothelioma diagnosis is already limiting enough. Don’t limit your legal options too.

You deserve more than just the convenient option. You deserve the best possible representation. Learn exactly how to evaluate and choose the right mesothelioma law firm for your specific situation.

1ndor22,https://www.reddit.com/r/Elderabuse_Support/comments/1ndor22/help_can_i_send_my_uncle_to_jail/,HELP! Can I send my uncle to jail?,"Hi! My story is a bit tooooooo long I typed it all and saved it in my notes incase I come across an attorney. I attempted to summarize everything but its still a bunch from this long story missing to make everything make sense! 

My grandmother died and I found out about the awful neglect when she went into the hospital months before her death. The doctors told my mother my grandmother had maggots coming from her infected areas on her legs and constantly asked my mom if anyone was staying with anyone or who?! 

My uncle his wife and 5 kids basically let my grandmother rot in her bed. She sat in her on defacation for two days possibly more before they called 911. 

They completely gave up on my grandmother because she almost made them fall when they carried her to the bathroom and my uncles back had slipped.. THEY DROPPED MY GRANDMOTHER AND ONLY CRIED ABOUT THEMSELVES. 

My grandmother was not a petite lady she was on a bunch of medication and we all know how that can catch up to you when you're already bed bound. My grandmother uses a cane and walker for anywhere more than 10 steps! She could walk to the bathroom by herself .. 

its more to this whole story but he didnt visit her in the hospital unless it was for money! his kids didnt visit her only once on her bday and when she died in the hospice. 

My grandmother would complain her coffee tasted funny when she moved with them.She was skeptical they were tryna k**l her. My uncle would mention her will or insurance policy more than once whenever she went into the hospital!! More than once like ok we got it... you wanna be in charge.

But nowhere to be found when she was in the hospital for months! in rehab for monthsss. 

When she passed my mother handled the arrangements, with no help from her big brother what so ever. He watched us search her whole room for her policy knowing he has it. 

Now my mother get calls from the family that my narcissist uncle and his family are about to get a huge house, and have new cars.. 

My mother is livid and I can't blame her! She's being doing all of the work for my grandmother since 2016 I came across a email my grandmother wrote to oprah about my mother taking care of her since 2016!!! Not sure why but that alone should let everyone know who was there. I have a bunch of proof of my mom crying to my uncle for help with my grandmother and he never would visit my grandmother. My uncle was ready to give my grandmother every alternative to k**l her in the hospital knowing her allergies and etc. They both were supposed to attend classes to clean my grandmother since she was completely bed bound. Her last days my uncle wasn't nowhere to be found unless it was for money.. She ignored his calls and texts too, she was terrified and would cryyyyyy so bad when we would leave the hospital and he would call and say he's coming (but nvr show up) 

My uncle did not attend the classes so my grandmother could not return home with him since 6 people refused to simply wash her up, wash her sheets, pillow cases or huff n puffd when she asked for coffee. My mom passed her classes and my grandmother got to come home with us. 

My grandmother opened up about the neglect and pleaded that we dont send him to jail. It's hard not to constantly think about it. She didn't deserve any of that, she gave her kids and siblings the world or whatever she could! 

Now my family and I are struggling, for years Ive helped my mother in any way i could, babysat my siblings and helped change my grandmother and wash her. Mind you she wasn't a small petite woman she weighed maybe 300 pounds while my mother and I weigh under 125!! It's hard getting a job and getting back on my feet after years of just being a caretaker for free and looking for nothing in return.. But now I feel like my mother especially deserves something for her time being taken for her kids, all the errands she ran when my uncle with a car refused.. My mother hasnt had a car for years so she made everything happen on metro trains, buses, amtrak and greyhound buses. 

Maybe this is the anger in my grief but he doesn't deserve to live luxury with two jobs, plus all his kids are working and his wife is a teacher of 12 years! they are very well off and always used my grandmother up. 

During talks with my grandmother she always said everything would be split in the middle but knowing my uncle is more than likely the beneficiary we might not ever see a cent.. While we struggle to get government assistance for anything I can't help to feel a bit angry at my grandmother as well. I love her with all my heart and I know Im the most trusted grandchild i cant help but to wonder why she didn't tell me anything about if there even was a policy. If their is no policy then thats completely fine but if there is my uncle doesnt deserve it ANY OF IT but my mother was still gonna honor my grandmothers wishes. 

I want to take things to court, I have proof and witnesses, family members mentioning what she confided in them about my uncle. I have recordings of conversations with my grandmother about my uncle as well. 

I don't know the first steps so if anyone can help me get started or help me figure this thing out. its hard watching my mother fight for my grandmother even after her death & still have nothing. She has the rights to her estate and didn't find a thing which is insane because everybody know there was thousandsss of dollars in her bank account. 

thanks for reading this far this is my second time typing this here to ask for help so i appreciate anyone for taking the time even if you dont respond.

So now I simply take a break for an hour/hour and a half, wear noise canceling headphones, reduce stimulation, then get back to work once I feel better and it turns out concerta lasts me 11 hours. If I manage to use them and start at the right time (because if you’re scrolling during the break it will be hard to get back on task so be careful) 

Just make sure to drink water and eat consistently and be cautious about drinking coffee during the day. I genuinely think a lot of us are confusing temporary overstimulation with concerta wearing off. ",2,1757534424.0,Concerta,1,1.0,False

Uber paid 25$ for it for California. It’s real really low. Because it depends on algorithm you absolutely need to decline some rides I would never take that ride again.

1ndom5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ndom5f/how_should_i_get_close_to_this_girl_without/,How should I get close to this girl without coming off as stalkerish?,"A few years ago I met this girl at my dance class. We danced and chatted a little bit but I didn't really get the chance to know her. However, I was really impressed with her and hoped to see her again. But unfortunately, I had to stop taking lessons and as a result I never saw her again. Since then, I think about her from time to time and I have kicked myself in the butt for not asking for hee number. 

However, something interesting happened.

I was on Facebook a couple of weeks ago and the girl's Facebook profile popped up as a recommendation. I looked at her profile and saw that she teaches dance and goes to my church (Although she goes to a different campus. So since I wanted to see her again, I decided to go to a dance social that her class was holding. When I got there she happily introduced herself to me and told her that I remembered her from Arthur Murray. She immediately remembered me and we started reconnecting. We starting talking about our church and eventually we danced a few times throughout the night. She even told me that I could come to her volleyball club that she hosts through her church. 

After, the party was over she came up to me and told me that it was nice meeting me. I asked her if she would like to join me at my swing dance club and she told me that she would try to make it. She really interested in going and I gave her the info about my swing club.

Two days later, I went to the event and she never showed up. 

So I am thinking either she is not interested in me or that she is and just couldn't simply make the event.

So what I want to do is ask her out for lunch or coffee and if she says no then just drop the whole idea of asking her out.

But here's the problem....

I am not able to reach her when I call her studio

And I can't go to the next monthly dance social because I have work that day.

I also can't sign up for church volleyball because I work on the days when they play volleyball.

So how could I approach this girl?",1,1757534283.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Yes it’s a hobby, and I’ve dumped quite some cash in to it already privately. I’ve had my BV now for about 2,5yrs and was thinking of buying it privately and on the company (like 70-30% or so), but no clue if this is actually feasable, and how to do so… do I just invoice it on the company and let my accountant handle it? 
I feel like i could easely justify a percentage on the company, because my clients need or would want coffee, but can’t possibly think 100% would go trough, the machine will be sitting in my private kitchen. 
I’m speaking of a 5500€ purchase.

1ndolnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/uktravel/comments/1ndolnz/scotland_itinerary/,Scotland Itinerary!,"Hello! This is my first time internationally and I am trying to plan my time here because i dont get a lot of vacation days. I basically picked out a couple of things that I really wanted to do and then I built off of those couple of things with what was in surrounding areas off of google maps and at the hotel were staying at. Its April 17-25.

We are staying at the Apex Grassmarket Hotel.

Day 1: Arrive in Edinburgh at 6:30 am
This day is just us grabbing coffee lunch and just shopping and wandering around. We were gonna get an Indian Takeaway and go to sleep early.

Day 2: we were gonna start off early with going to Arthur’s seat and then grabbing a coffee and hitting Edinburgh Castle. We were then going to get food and maybe just do more shopping before we go to Calton Hill and we wanted to hit the Witchery for dinner.

Day 3: Then we are gonna get breakfast and go on the Harry Potter tour do more shopping and get a Sunday roast. We’d like to see the Scott monument and then see the real Mary Kings Cross guided tour. After that, it would be a pub. 

Day 4: we were gonna wake up early, get coffee and then go to Waverly Station so we can take a train to Stirling Castle and do the tour. Afterward, we wanted to get a taxi to the Wallace monument and then come back to the same train station.

My cousin wants to go see Glasgow from here and then return late back to Edinburgh. I think she just has one shot and a dinner that she wants to see in Glasgow.

Day 5: we wake up breakfast again, go more shopping and do that islander workshop for the purse along with seeing Saint Giles Cathedral, and the museum of Scotland and then we would go dinner and maybe catch a really late ghost tour.

Day 6: we wanted to hit up a local bakery, go to the writers museum and then maybe go up to Dean’s Village and then and have dinner at scran and scrallies. Then we head back to the hotel and we wanted to go to Stramash.

Day 7: this is a preplanned tour day. It’s a Highland tour just for one day. They’re taking care of everything else and then we would be back in Edinburgh by 8 PM.

Day 8: this would be wake up, go to Holyrood Palace and have tea at the Palace. Do a little bit of light shopping. Get some Chinese Takeaway and end our day at Calton Hill.

Day 9: grab breakfast and one last shop and then fly home.

We both are more travelers than vacationers. When we go places, we really like to see a lot of stuff rather than sit around and relax. I also have a couple friends from England and Denmark, who might be popping over to see us. However, I wanted to know if this seems like a doable schedule of things that we would try to see. I tried to really schedule it so there’s only maybe one or two big things each day and the rest is just filled up with finding good food, spots, and shopping.

I am happy to take any advice.

She has been diagnosed with BPD few months after we got together and has been managing it really well - she has medication from her psychiatrist and attends therapy regularly. Overall, she has put in a lot of effort to get her diagnosis under control and she has been doing really well - she can regulate her emotions and communicates really well.

For the year or so, we have not run into any substantial issues and the relationship has been very fulfilling as well as pleasant. As a matter of fact, she has been an absolutely amazing girlfriend and her diagnosis never posed any issues. However, yesterday evening she turned into a completely different person in the matter of minutes and I am unsure how to approach this.

The issue is as follows: On the weekend we are supposed to travel abroad to visit a city in a neighbouring country. Her parents are supposed to meet us there, too. (They live abroad but over the year I have already met them several times on different occassions). The thing is, that one of my university classmates /(Female) also lives in the city and I made plans to go grab a coffee with her. For context we are arriving on Saturday, then in the afternoon me and my girlfriend will split up - I will visit the said friend and my gf will hang out with her parents. In the evening, the four of us are planning to have dinner togerther.

Initially everything was alright, my GF did point out that she is not 100% happy with my decision to visit a friend instead of being with her and her parents, but because it is a rare occassion for me to see the classmate and I am joining my GF and her parents in the evening, she is okay with it. At the same time, as she was describing how the situation is not ideal for her, she let me know that she does not want to be a controlling girlfriend and that my ask is completely reasonable.

So far so good, but then, suddenly, something switched yesterday evening. She confessed, that she is absolutely not happy with my decision to join my friend. The problem seems to be the following:

She has these negative emotions about our meeting

She logically understands that me meeting a friend that lives in a specific city abroad is reasonable

Because of this she would also feel very uncomfortable if she had to order me not to meet her as she would feel as a bad partner

She feels that her only options thus are: let me meet her and feel uncomfortable because of that, or ask me not to meet her and feel uncomfortable because she will feel controlling

The issue then stems from this perception that no matter what she does, she will feel negative, which she told me makes her feel really stressed and anxious. I understand that the brain of a person with BPD functions differently and I can see why being stuck with only two options that are both uncomfortable is rising her anxiety through the roof.

It then sort of escalated from there, she told me that, as her brain perceives me as the source of this absolutely horrible situation, she does not want to be close to me. She has suggested we do the trip separately and has asked me to sleep in the kitchen yesterday if possible. Unfortunately, we are both working full-time so me sleeping on a mattress in the kitchen felt unreasonable and so I declined and explained my point of view. I offered her to sleep in the kitchen if she feels uncomfortable in my presence.

Based on her words, she currently feels the love for me has dissappeared as she now has this negative connotation with me, although she understands that it is not logically based and is not acting on it. At the same time, she has explained, that because she was put in this unfortunate position by my existence she does not feel she likes me anymore, does not like our flat anymore, does not like the idea of travelling this weekend anymore and just overall feels like she would prefer that the whole situation just dissappears (as she does not see a solution that would be acceptable).

My question to those for you who have experience with BPD or partners with BPD, can you advice me on how to procced in this case? I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible, but I also do not see an easy way out. Is there something specific I can do to help her manage this? Maybe some way to effectively communicate with her that everything is going to be alright? Or is a better solution to give her space now and let her figure it out on her own? Tbh, I am completely lost as what to do, but still want to be a partner that she can rely on in these difficult situations. Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you!",0,1757534040.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

For context we are arriving on Saturday, then in the afternoon me and my girlfriend will split up - I will visit the said friend and my gf will hang out with her parents. In the evening, the four of us are planning to have dinner togerther.

Initially everything was alright, my GF did point out that she is not 100% happy with my decision to visit a friend instead of being with her and her parents, but because it is a rare occassion for me to see the classmate and I am joining my GF and her parents in the evening, she is okay with it. At the same time, as she was describing how the situation is not ideal for her, she let me know that she does not want to be a controlling girlfriend and that my ask is completely reasonable.

So far so good, but then, suddenly, something switched yesterday evening. She confessed, that she is absolutely not happy with my decision to join my friend. The problem seems to be the following:

She has these negative emotions about our meeting

She logically understands that me meeting a friend that lives in a specific city abroad is reasonable

Because of this she would also feel very uncomfortable if she had to order me not to meet her as she would feel as a bad partner

She feels that her only options thus are: let me meet her and feel uncomfortable because of that, or ask me not to meet her and feel uncomfortable because she will feel controlling

The issue then stems from this perception that no matter what she does, she will feel negative, which she told me makes her feel really stressed and anxious. I understand that the brain of a person with BPD functions differently and I can see why being stuck with only two options that are both uncomfortable is rising her anxiety through the roof.

It then sort of escalated from there, she told me that, as her brain perceives me as the source of this absolutely horrible situation, she does not want to be close to me. She has suggested we do the trip separately and has asked me to sleep in the kitchen yesterday if possible. Unfortunately, we are both working full-time so me sleeping on a mattress in the kitchen felt unreasonable and so I declined and explained my point of view. I offered her to sleep in the kitchen if she feels uncomfortable in my presence.

Based on her words, she currently feels the love for me has dissappeared as she now has this negative connotation with me, although she understands that it is not logically based and is not acting on it. At the same time, she has explained, that because she was put in this unfortunate position by my existence she does not feel she likes me anymore, does not like our flat anymore, does not like the idea of travelling this weekend anymore and just overall feels like she would prefer that the whole situation just dissappears (as she does not see a solution that would be acceptable).

My question to those for you who have experience with BPD or partners with BPD, can you advice me on how to procced in this case? I want to make her feel as comfortable as possible, but I also do not see an easy way out. Is there something specific I can do to help her manage this? Maybe some way to effectively communicate with her that everything is going to be alright? Or is a better solution to give her space now and let her figure it out on her own? Tbh, I am completely lost as what to do, but still want to be a partner that she can rely on in these difficult situations. Any advice is highly appreciated, thank you!",1,1757533941.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

1ndofg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1ndofg9/how_can_i_can_get_close_to_this_girl/,How can I can get close to this girl?,"A few years ago I met this girl at my dance class. We danced and chatted a little bit but I didn't really get the chance to know her. However, I was really impressed with her and hoped to see her again. But unfortunately, I had to stop taking lessons and as a result I never saw her again. Since then, I think about her from time to time and I have kicked myself in the butt for not asking for hee number. 

However, something interesting happened.

I was on Facebook a couple of weeks ago and the girl's Facebook profile popped up as a recommendation. I looked at her profile and saw that she teaches dance and goes to my church (Although she goes to a different campus. So since I wanted to see her again, I decided to go to a dance social that her class was holding. When I got there she happily introduced herself to me and told her that I remembered her from Arthur Murray. She immediately remembered me and we started reconnecting. We starting talking about our church and eventually we danced a few times throughout the night. She even told me that I could come to her volleyball club that she hosts through her church. 

After, the party was over she came up to me and told me that it was nice meeting me. I asked her if she would like to join me at my swing dance club and she told me that she would try to make it. She really interested in going and I gave her the info about my swing club.

Two days later, I went to the event and she never showed up. 

So I am thinking either she is not interested in me or that she is and just couldn't simply make the event.

So what I want to do is ask her out for lunch or coffee and if she says no then just drop the whole idea of asking her out.

But here's the problem....

I am not able to reach her when I call her studio

And I can't go to the next monthly dance social because I have work that day.

I also can't sign up for church volleyball because I work on the days when they play volleyball.

So how could I approach this girl?

1ndoe90,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1ndoe90/day_one_again/,Day one .... Again,"We went on a vacation. We probably would have cancelled it a couple of weeks prior due to a fight if it weren't for the fact that her kid came along.

The flight sucked ... Some kid was kicking my chair and i turned to its mother and said something ... My ex called me mysoginistic on the spot. ... it felt like shit and this served as a prelude to a massive fight we'd get into on the 2nd day.

Day two ... The tension in the air culminated into a massive fight and i had started to notice that she was poking and prodding at my attempts to keep it together even though i was visibly irritated ... And i eventually snapped.

What made me lose my calm was the fact that i told her i loved her and she refused ro say it back. She refused iver  and over again and it got to me. An argument broke out.

I remember it turning into a fight because at one point she said i'd chosen to be in a bad mood and wanted to fight so that i can get it out of my system ... And this set me off because i hate fighting.

I felt disconsodered, ignored, played, misunderstood and rejected ... So i went from upset to angry.

We had the worst fight of my life ...

A lot of hurtful things came out of both our mouths. I remember thinking ""omg she just won't stop"" ... ""She keeps escalating everything"".

It got so bad that at one point i thought to myself ""THIS fight is now at the level where men  beat their wives ... Holy shit ... Why is she pushing it further ... is she trying to see if i'll hit her? Wtf?""

That night i had packed my bags and was 1 click away from buying a last minute plane ticket home.
I woke her up, demanded her to check that she had all the documents for her and her kid ... Told her that if she wanted me to leave, my shit is packed ... But noticed a spark of regret and sadness when she said ""do whatever you want""

That moment plus the idea of ""if i take this flight and leave, it's definitely over amd i don't want that."" ... Also ... "" If something were to happen to them ... I can't abandon yhem here"" ... And maybe the exhaustion of it all ... .... I stayed.

The next morning ... She woke up and noticed that i was still there ... She stretched and went back to sleep.
I went out to get coffees and buy some sunglasses and when i returned she was like "" for me? ... I wanted that sunglass bag thing"" ... And we somehow made up. She blamed alcohol at one point.

The following day everything was great ... For a time i was happy with the fact that we were officially on vacation .. i was rhere with the love of my life ... And felt like we were a family.

Then we got back on a bus ... I asked her kindly for something and she snapped at me seemingly out of nowhere. I got upset ... She began accusing me of being angry ... And ... Ok ... I wasn't exactly thrilled about stuff but was trying to cool off.

That day ended in another argument .... And pretty much the first 5 days were kind of shit.

At one point she complimented another man she had just met. This eas about 10 hours after sating i ate too much and my face was getting pudgy ... 

That guy's kid made friends with hers ... And we finally had some time to ourselves by the beach ....yet she would always find an excuse to do something other than spend time with me...

...  This one time i felt like she wanted to spend a bit of time with me and show me how to swim in a pool, i tried hugging her ... She literally pushed me away with this look of distain in her eyes ... Which upset me ... So i dove in and when o resurfaced she accused me of being angry and splashing her. ... She was ears-deep in a pool ... And i splashed her.

... That night her kid started throwing up and i spent the last two days trying my best to get medicine and take care of him. She found a way to criticize everything i did still even though she knew i went out of my way to try and get everything they needed.

But alas ... After taking the kid to the hospital, and finally getting on the flight back home ... Her making fun of my flight anxiety and treating everything i said about why o felt like shit flying because i had a horrible experience not too long ago and whatnot ... Everything was met with ""whatever ... You're exagerating ... Etc""

I even bought her jewlery and a dress ... And she somehow managed to flip that against me as well

... Anyway ... So ... After having taken care if her kid, and making it back in one piece ... Sleeping 4 hours combined in the last 2 days ... We're home ... And still together.

"" Need anything love "" i ask ..
""Absolutely nothing"" she answers.

... So i got the hint that she needs her space amd wanted to deal with things ... But went to the pharmacy and got some meds wr couldn't get abroad for the kid ... Gave them to her ... Went to my place and got a couple of hpurs of rest.

First thing i did when i woke up was to check up on her ... 

"" Need anything ? "" ... ""No.""
"" Wanna spend some time together now that things have cooled down and the kid is ok? "" ... Silence
"" Want me to leave? "" ... ""Yeah .... well i'm gonna take a shower""

... The enxt day i wake up and go to work ... Write her a text message saying that i forgive everything ... Big mistake.

She snaps at me, demands her keys back, and another argument turns into a fight ... And more hurtful things come out.

... It's been a week now and i've tried so many times to make up ... I just can't find it in me anymore. I'm going nc.

I still want her back so much.
I can understand that she is avoidant and i'm anxious ... And when i get angry i say hurtful stuff ... But i'm making progress and becoming better ... She refuses to change.

At one point she said she was testing my limits deliberately.
Last time i saw her, her hair was done up and she had makeup on ... She said she was in bed ... But i know her evening routine ... And i know she wasn't cheating.

I keep hoping she'll cool off and for once knock on my door.

I love her so much ... And even though i swear i'm aware if what i wrote here and how it makes her look ... I'm excusing her behavior the following way:

She is avoidant ... She has a kid ... She tested me because she wants what' best for him ... And wouldn't have put me through that if she didn't care and wanted to see if i'm a good match.

She wouldn't have cried after the breakup if she didn't care.

She did most of those things because she felt she had to ... Not out of hatred or narcissism or spite ... But because she saw me as someone with whom to have a lofe together .... And going on a vacation together was a crucial step in our relationship ... So she had to know just who i am under extreme pressure.

... 

... If this is the case ... I think i failed her tests and the breakup hurts me the most.

... At the same time ... I'm not in the wrong either.

I wish we'd get back together.

If all she wants is for me to contol my angry side ... I can work harder.

I love her enough to look past all of this.
And it breaks my heart that she diminishes everything good i did, and refuses to validate the fact that she is the one who should have shown some patience... And love.

Predictable,"Last Sunday morning, I was enjoying a quiet cup of coffee when I heard what sounded like a small aircraft taking off right outside my window.

It was my neighbor let’s call him Todd in full tactical yard-cleaning gear. I’m talking goggles, gloves, ear protection, and what looked like a windbreaker designed for arctic storms. Why? Because he was about to take on the six leaves in his yard with an industrial-strength leaf blower.

I watched, intrigued and slightly concerned.

Instead of calmly directing the leaves into a pile like a normal person, Todd cranked the blower up to full blast and went full chaos mode. Leaves, dirt, and possibly someone’s missing Amazon package were launched into the air. At one point, he spun in a full circle like a confused tornado. The blower yanked him sideways and he had to replant his feet like he was resisting a strong ocean current.

Then it got worse.

A plastic bag blew across his yard at the exact wrong moment and got sucked into the intake. The blower made a sound like a dying robot, then started billowing smoke. Instead of turning it off, Todd began hitting it like it owed him money. All while yelling something that sounded suspiciously like, “It’s alive!”

Finally, his wife walked out in a robe, holding a mug, and without breaking stride, unplugged the whole thing.

She just looked at him and said, *“Todd. It's Sunday. Please.”*

Todd mumbled something about ""almost winning"" and walked inside. The blower? Done. The leaves? Still there.

The minutes dragged by glacially. Kids rushed home from school, drenched in sweat from the rising heat. I never thought I would miss school, but being sick for three days has placed me in the company of boredom. My messy, black hair had been suffering from constant bedhead. I was glad to see some of the color come back to my skin, though there wasn’t much to start with. *Clack-clack*, “Pew! Pew!”, and giggles racked against my aching head as my brother, Donnie, played with his toys on the floor. He had crumbs of chips in his thin, black hair. Some had fallen and stuck to his little arm hairs running along his tan skin. “Donnie, please be quiet for once,” I grumbled as I rubbed my temples. 

“Mamá said to play in the room while she’s cleaning.” Donnie struck one of his space alien figures with the plastic sword of the knight I had given him years ago. I didn’t have the energy to yell at him as I stared him down.

*Dink -dink*

A knock came from my window. Standing there was my friend, Abraham. He still had his backpack on, sweating and breathing a bit forcefully. He gave a big grin as he began speaking. As the glass muffled his words, I slid the window up. “*Qué pasó*, homie?”

“Wassup foo! You tryin’ to watch that show at my house? My moms said she was cool with it if your folks are.” Abraham’s eyes darted from me back towards his house down the street. His usual cool demeanor was noticeably absent. 

He wasn’t the only one excited about the show tonight. “*Show of the century! Only something that could happen in ‘95!*” according to all the marketing that every local radio station and the papers have spewed. Hell, even the cynical seniors with all their exclusivity against freshmen like me were talking about it. What was bizarre was that no one knew what it was going to be about or even the name. Grocery store clerks gossiping at registers, teachers mingling in the hallways, the mailman conversing with my dad. All of them were speculating about what could be so sensational about it. The entirety of Los Perdidos Valley was holding its breath in anticipation.

“Nah, sorry, man. I’m still sick. But my mom said she thinks that I’ll be better tomorrow. We can talk about the show then, at least.” 

Abraham shrugged, “If you say so, man. Drink your fluids or whatever they say, I guess.” 

Before he could make a beeline back to his house, Donnie piped up, “Can I go and hang out at Abraham’s?”

“Shut up, Donnie.” I rolled my eyes at the request. 

“EY! What’d you say to your brother?!” My dad barged into the room, one hand ready at his belt like a gunslinger in a duel. 

“Nothing, Pops! I didn’t say anything. Right, Abra-?” I turned to the window, looking for some back-up, only to see that the dark bastard had already run off. I gulped as I turned back towards my hulking father. He wasn’t the tallest man, but his width and how he carried himself would make a silverback gorilla whimper. The air was thick with tension as he locked his gaze on me.

“Haha! Scaredy-cat!” My dad laughed boisterously at my fear of his belt. I chuckled softly as I relaxed. He marched over and said in a stern voice, “Seriously, if you’re mean to your brother, I will kick your ass, comprende?” I meekly nodded my head. “Good, here *Güero*. Got you these.” He dropped a sack of oranges on my lap, playfully knocking my head to the side, and left the room.

Shortly after leaving, Mamá and Ana entered the room. She had brought in some tea and a glass of ice water. She placed them on the desk, removing the stacks of books I had sitting there to my stuffed bookshelf. 

“You doing ok, *mijo*? Are you hungry?” She gently touched the back of her hand against my forehead. Her touch was soft; it was like being rubbed against by a black jungle cat. 

“I’m warm, but I think my headache is the bigger issue.” I glared at Donnie, currently in his own little world of space-faring warriors. 

“Ay Miguel, just relax and drink your tea. I’ll bring your dinner when it’s ready, and God will help your body heal.” Ana stared at me with deep, dark pools that were her eyes. “Ana, *mija*, show him what you made for him.” Mamá urged Ana with a slight nudge. Ana raised a crayon drawing. It was a splatter of colors, erratically dancing across the paper. 

“Oh, yay…You did so good, Ana!” I looked to my mom for guidance as to what was being depicted. 

“I used all the colors in my box!” Ana exclaimed. 

“You sure did.” My attempts to decipher my sister’s art failed as my mom doted over her daughter. Ana gently placed the drawing on my bed, and she was raised into my mother’s arms. She was the spitting image of Mamá, a panther and her cub. 

Ava, chewing and popping bubblegum, walked into my room. She dropped a stack of papers on my desk. 

“Here’s your homework, loser.” She flipped back a strand of hair, a tendril of darkness. If that wasn’t a telltale sign of a *bruja*, I don’t know what is. Her sin of *brujería,* or being emo, really, was answered by the divine punishment of having the misfortune of looking like my dad. 

“Miguel, thank your sister for bringing your homework. Ava, don’t call your brother a loser.” I mumbled out a thank you as Ava just rolled her eyes at my mom’s request. 

She nearly bumped into *Abuela* on her way out of my room, “*perdón, Abuela*.” *Abuela* gave Ava’s arm a soft rub as she passed by. She had a small cup of coffee that she raised as she approached me.

“*Un cafecito para Mijito.”* Mamá stepped in front of her, taking the coffee from my *abuela*. 

“No coffee! *Miguel necesita descansar*.” *Abuela* waved her away, walking around her and sitting at the side of my bed. 

“*Oh mijito pobrecito!*” She pulled me in for one of her deep hugs. I was glad to be told that I looked like her despite the laughs that would often follow the comparison.

*Ba-dum…tik-tik…ba-dum…tik-tik*

It always pulled at my heartstrings to hear that clicking noise in her chest. She needed a new pacemaker, but they’re expensive. I hoped to get a summer job in a few weeks to help with the cost. Pops said he could put me to work, which sounded like I was in for some demanding labor, but it would be worth it.

Mamá gently pulled at *Abuela’s* shoulder. “Come on, everybody. Let Miguel rest.” She reached for Donnie’s hand. He clasped it with one hand and clutched his knight with the other. *Abuela* followed her shortly after. 

As they left, I spoke up. “Wait, the show starts soon, right? I don’t want to miss it.” I grabbed a shirt hanging off my bed frame to join them in the living room.

“No, Miguel. Looking at the TV screen will strain your eyes and make your headache worse. Just get some sleep for now. I’ll bring you dinner when it’s ready.” 

“But-” My mom stared at me with fierce, penetrating eyes. “Ok, Mamá.” I slipped back into the covers as she turned off the lights and closed the door.",1,1757533518.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Basically I was on a walk as I usually do and I was almost hitting about 3 miles. It was a pretty hot day and I had 2 cups of coffee before hand and maybe about 20 ounces of water. All of a sudden on my walk, I got extremely lightheaded after walking up a hill, my heart rate was about 150 at the time before it skyrocketed, then ended up being in the 190s from breathing so heavily and freaking out. I was panicking at the time and hyperventilating. A neighbor called 911 and they took my vitals, which were fine. My heart rate began to come down and by the time I got checked out by the EMTs it was down to 120 or so (about 10 minutes after the panic). My biggest concern was the fact that my hands locked up like claws. Basically my thumb was locked into my fingers on both hands and would not open until I calmed down and drank water. I went to the doctor yesterday, have talked to my therapist as well and they said this could either be from dehydration or hyperventilating. I got my labs back and pretty much everything was normal other than borderline high cholesterol which the doctor said I can reduce with diet and exercise and did not seem concerned.

1ndo8h0,https://i.redd.it/de87e0e25eof1.jpeg,I bought one of the STRONGEST fragrances on the market.,"Ok this will be my last review for a while. 

Imagine you are late for work, but you need a coffee. Fall is around the corner, so you see that the shop is offering a ""maple syrup mocha,"" with **notes** of ""caramel, vanilla, cocoa, and amber."" You buy the coffee. You set it down in the drink compartment. You drive a bit. You pick up the drink to take a swig and BAM -- you have to slam on brakes. The drink spills over your entire body. You now smell like a Waffle House. 

You get to work (no coffee, since you are now wearing it), and everyone is staring at you. You sit down. Your boss calls you into the office, sneezing. She alerts you that she is being forced to send you home due to your excruciatingly strong coffee/syrup smell. 

You go home. You remove your clothes, shower, and throw the load in the wash. You come out of the shower *still* smelling like Waffles. Your clothes still smell like waffles, too. You wash them three more times. Nothing works. You set the clothes aside.

Years later, you cannot wear that work suit without someone asking, ""did you eat pancakes for breakfast?""

That is ""**Followed**"" by **Kerosene** in a nutshell. 

I thought the reviews were exaggerating. I could smell the syrup before even opening the box when this came in. I sprayed this *one time* on my wrist at approximately 12pm one night. The next day, around 5pm, someone ask me if I had cooked Waffles for dinner. When I came home from work that night around 8pm, my apartment smelled like Waffles. *For Days*.

1ndo1oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Background-Raise6389/comments/1ndo1oc/the_best_water_bottles/,The Best Water Bottles,"Water is one of those things I constantly forget to stay on top of, and having a good bottle has honestly made the difference for me. A reusable one isn’t just practical, it saves me from grabbing plastic bottles on the go, and I like feeling like I’ve got something that fits my routine. I’ve tried a bunch over the years, and these are the ones I think are actually worth using. They all do something a little different, depending on whether you want insulation, something cheap and lightweight, or just a design that makes drinking water less of a chore.

There are a ton of options out there, but the bottles below stood out to me because they weren’t just hype. They each hit that sweet spot of being durable, comfortable to use, and easy to keep around for everyday hydration. Whether I’m out running errands, hitting the gym, or just sitting at my desk, one of these bottles usually ends up being my go-to.

## 🏆 Best Overall Option: [Hydro Flask Wide Mouth](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-bottles#hydro-flask-wide-mouth)

The Hydro Flask Wide Mouth has been my trusty sidekick for years. I love that I can toss it in my bag and not worry about condensation soaking through, and the insulation actually works. I’ll fill it with ice water before a long drive, and hours later it’s still freezing cold. The wide mouth is especially nice when I want to throw in a handful of ice without fighting with the opening, and I’ve dropped it more times than I’d like to admit without leaving more than a small ding.

The only small annoyance is that the cap requires two hands to unscrew, so it’s not the easiest if I’m multitasking. Still, I like that the lids are interchangeable, I’ve used the straw lid for a while but always come back to the simple chug cap. It feels a little sturdier and more reliable. Overall, this is the bottle I recommend to anyone who just wants one solid pick without overthinking it.

## 🌡️ Best Insulated Option: [YETI Rambler Bottle](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-bottles#yeti-rambler-bottle)

The YETI Rambler is the tank of water bottles. I bought one after a friend swore by it for camping, and I can see why, it keeps drinks cold all day and doesn’t ever taste metallic. It’s heavier than most bottles I’ve used, but that also makes it feel solid, like you’re carrying something indestructible. The coating holds up really well too, mine still looks pretty new despite banging around in the back of my car.

I also like the different cap options. The chug cap makes it easier to sip without spilling, but for coffee I’ll switch to the HotShot cap. It’s not the lightest bottle, and I wouldn’t take it on a long hike, but for commuting or just leaving at my desk, it’s perfect. Definitely one of the most rugged and reliable bottles I’ve owned.

## 💸 Best Budget Option: [Nalgene Wide Mouth Bottle](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-bottles#nalgene-wide-mouth-bottle)

The Nalgene Wide Mouth is the first “real” reusable bottle I ever owned back in college, and it’s still one of the best cheap options. It’s super lightweight, takes a beating, and I love being able to see how much water I’ve got left at a glance. I’ve dropped these more times than I can count, and they never seem to crack or break. For the price, it’s hard to beat.

Of course, it’s not insulated, so if you want ice-cold water all day, this isn’t the one. But for carrying to the gym or just having a big, no-nonsense bottle around the house, it’s a classic. The cap loop also saves you from losing the lid, which I’ve done with plenty of other bottles. I keep one around even though I own fancier ones, just because it’s easy and reliable.

## 💧 Best Leakproof Option: [Owala FreeSip Sway](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-bottles#owala-freesip-sway)

The Owala FreeSip Sway is a bottle I didn’t think I’d like until I actually tried it. The straw-and-chug combo lid is genius, I’ll sip from the straw when I’m working at my desk and then just tilt it back for a big drink after a run. The locking mechanism is way better than the old Owala models, so I don’t worry about it leaking in my bag anymore.

The handle is surprisingly handy too, especially on the 30-ounce size, which feels like the sweet spot between capacity and bulk. Cleaning the lid takes a little extra effort since it has more small parts, but it hasn’t been a deal breaker for me. For anyone who wants one bottle that works in different situations, this one is honestly really clever.

## 🥂 Best Glass Option: [Purifyou Glass Water Bottle](https://productbible.com/blog/best-water-bottles#purifyou-glass-water-bottle)

The Purifyou Glass Water Bottle is the one I reach for when I want my water to taste as clean as possible. There’s no metal or plastic aftertaste at all, and the narrow mouth makes sipping feel natural. The silicone sleeve adds some grip and a bit of protection, I’ve dropped mine once on tile and it survived, which I didn’t expect.

That said, it’s heavier than my stainless bottles, so I mostly use it at home or at work. I wouldn’t carry it around all day, but I do like having it when I want that pure glass feel. If you care about taste above all else, this is the one I’d suggest. It looks sleek too, which doesn’t hurt.",1,1757532936.0,u_Background-Raise6389,0,1.0,False
1ndo129,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianWorkplace/comments/1ndo129/karma_kicked_my_office_bully_harder_than_i_ever/,Karma kicked my office bully harder than I ever could,"TL;DR: Joined a company, had a mentor who hated me, sabotaged my work, and creeped on girls with “have you eaten” texts. Tried to fail me, got caught. Later, a senior girl (my friend) filed a POSH case with proof. I was witness. He got fired instantly.

Every office has that one guy who thinks he is the CEO. HR bhi woh hai, boss bhi woh hai, and even security guard ka kaam bhi woh hi karega. This story is about him. And me. The guy he thought was invisible.

So I joined this company a few months back. Three months of training. Bhai, itna tough tha ki kabhi kabhi lagta tha main exam pass karne aaya hoon ya UPSC dene. One mistake, and poora task zero. End of training, ek bada exam tha. Fail, and straight exit. Pass, and you continue. Simple.

We were around 30 people in training. Somehow, we managed. Then we got shifted to the main office floor.

First day itself, villain ka entry. I dropped my bag at my cubicle, went for coffee, came back, and my bag was on the floor. And there he was, sitting in my chair, chilling like he owned the company. I said politely, “Bro, this is my seat.” He looked at me, top to bottom, gave that smirk, and said, “Newbies sit in the corner.”

Us din mujhe samajh aa gaya, boss fight yahi hai.

Next day, they made groups of three with mentors. My group had two girls and me. Guess who the mentor was? Same bag-throwing, corner-seat philosopher. Matlab universe ne clearly likh diya tha, “Beta, tujhe is bande se hi ladna hai.”

From then on, life was pure torture. He never answered my questions. I had to beg him for help, still he ignored me. His friends would laugh, make inside jokes, and I knew I was the joke. Meanwhile, he turned into “Free Boyfriend Service Pvt Ltd” for the girls. Helping them, checking their work, even doing their tasks. Aur main? Sitting in the corner, invisible.

But the girls in my group were amazing. They helped me with tasks, shared food, asked if I had eaten, dragged me for coffee. That closeness burned him more than a Mirchi could

So he targeted me. He started mailing my TL, trainer, and HR, saying I had not done practice tasks. He noted down every small mistake of mine even monitored my breaks, while the girls’ records were spotless. For more than forty days, I lived in hell. Har din sochta tha, “Yaar, kya main galat jagah aa gaya hoon?”

Then came exam day. I gave my best. I knew I had done well. But who had to evaluate my paper? Yes, Mr. Villain. I needed 85 to pass. He gave me 80. On top of that, he deleted data from my file in the shared drive. Bhai, ek exam clear karna tha, isne CID ka case bana diya.

But kismet ke saath chhoti si Google Sheets thi. I caught him. Showed the file history to my trainer . He was forced to add my marks back. I passed.

But his ego? That was on rofff. He started telling my friends I knew nothing, that once we hit the floor, only he could help. And outside office hours? Pure creep mode. Texts like, “Have you eaten?” “Do you have a boyfriend?” Imagine getting this from a guy jo khud ka reflection dekhke bhi awkward lagta hai.

The girls were fed up. One even told me, “If he doesn’t stop, I’ll file a POSH complaint.”

And then came the real twist.

A senior girl, same level as him, filed a formal POSH complaint. And she was a good friend of mine. We used to share cabs every day, so hum dono ki dosti alag level pe thi. She trusted me and showed me everything. Proof tha uske paas. Screenshots of him asking for nudes, sending filthy messages, harassing her nonstop.

HR called me in as a witness. And you know what? I confirmed everything. His number, his accounts, the exact same ones he used to message my friends too. I told HR how my friends felt when he harassed them. The whole picture was clear. No hiding left.

HR moved fast. She won the case. He was fired on the spot.

Picture that moment. The same guy who threw my bag on the floor, who told me to sit in the corner, who tortured me for forty days, who thought he was untouchable, was now packing his own bag quietly. No smirk, no jokes, nothing. Bas ek villain ki dukhi exit scene.


And me? The so-called nobody? I stayed. Sometimes, karma does not send a warning mail. It sends termination mail.

\
2025 Update: According to Forbes Business and Reuters, Bahrain’s non-oil sector grew by 5.1% in Q1 2025, driven by fintech, manufacturing, and logistics in Manama’s economic zones. New regulations regarding labor dispute resolution took effect in March, streamlining procedures and reducing average case settlement times from 100 to 55 days.\
\
So how do you handle labor disputes smartly in today’s Bahrain? Here’s exactly what you need to know, without getting lost in bureaucratic mazes.\
\
Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting in Bahrain's financial district. report).\
Key Economic Highlights:\
\
GDP Growth: 3.8% projected for 2025 (Reuters), led by strong non-oil performance.\
Labor Force: Over 915,000, including 600,000+ expats.\
Foreign Ownership: 99% allowed in many business structures. For specifics on 100% foreign-friendly activities, see here.\
Major Business Districts: Bahrain Bay, Financial Harbour, Seef, Diplomatic Area, and Salman Industrial City.\
\
Importantly, since 2025’s regulatory harmonization, labor dispute resolution is now faster, more transparent, and less costly—Bahrain’s answer to staying globally competitive.\
\
Understanding Labor Disputes in Bahrain: Definitions & Context\
Whether you’re running a fintech start-up in Bahrain Bay or managing a logistics firm in Salmabad, labor disputes can strike unexpectedly.\
A labor dispute covers any disagreement between employer and employee over matters like:\
- Contract terms & termination\
- Wages or leave\
- Disciplinary actions\
- Working conditions\
- End-of-service benefits\
The Bahraini Labour Law (Law No. 36 of 2012, with 2025 amendments) governs these disputes. If you have a company registered via the Sijilat platform, you must follow these updated procedures—no exceptions.\
\
Key Business Structures & Labor Responsibilities\
\
Alt text: Business structure and team collaboration in Bahrain.: Most popular for expat investors. Shares liability among owners.\
- SPC (Single Person Company): Perfect for solo founders or small family offices.\
- Branch Office: Foreign companies seeking Bahrain market entry.\
- Free Zone Entity*: Operating in Bahrain’s free zones offers special employment perks and streamlined dispute management.\
I once faced a case involving an LLC (WLL) in Seef where a misunderstanding over Ramadan work hours led to an unexpected dispute. Understanding the business entity’s labor obligations makes all the difference—especially when dealing with the LMRA (Labour Market Regulatory Authority) and MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism).\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: How to File a Labor Dispute in Bahrain (2025 Process)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation with paperwork in Bahrain company.\
First, try resolving disputes directly via employer-employee discussions—often in a majlis-style meeting with coffee, reflecting Bahrain’s consensus culture.\
Surprisingly, informal negotiation closes 60% of workplace disputes here. Failing this, proceed as follows.\
Step 2: Prepare Documentation\
You’ll need:\
- Copy of the signed employment contract (Arabic/English)\
- CPR (ID) copies for both parties\
- Pay slips, attendance logs\
- LMRA registration details\
- Any written warnings or disciplinary forms\
- Resignation/termination letters\
\
Insider tip: Always keep digital scans of all employment documents in a cloud account—Sijilat’s e-portal accepts direct uploads, saving hours.\
\
Step 3: Submission to the Ministry of Labour’s Dispute Office\
Location: Ministry of Labour, Isa Town or Bahrain Bay Branch\
Hours: Sunday–Thursday, 7:30am–2:00pm (adjusted during Ramadan)\
You can submit your complaint:\
- In-Person: Visit the Labour Complaints Counter at Isa Town HQ. Early mornings mean much shorter queues (learned this the hard way after a four-hour wait at noon).\
- Online: Register at Bahrain’s official portal, select Labor Disputes, and upload all documents.\
- Tamkeen Business Centers: New for 2025, these branches accept labor complaints from entrepreneurs, particularly those in the Diplomatic Area.\
Step 4: Mediation Phase (Mandatory Pre-litigation)\
A Ministry mediator invites both parties—usually within 7-10 business days—to a joint session. Expect a formal but cordial environment, with tea or coffee (declining is considered mildly rude). Most disputes in Bahrain settle at this phase, thanks to official encouragement for amicable solutions.\
If you reach agreement:\
- Sign the official settlement form—legally binding and immediately enforceable.\
If not:\
- Move to the Labour Courts.\
Step 5: Referral to the Labour Court\
If mediation fails, the case is officially referred to Manama’s Labour Court.\
- Filing Fee: BHD 5–15, depending on claim amount (detailed cost breakdown).\
- Hearing Timeline: New 2025 regulations guarantee a first hearing within 30 days.\
- Court Venue: Labour Court, Diplomatic Area, Manama.\
You’ll need originals of all documents and an Arabic translation if submitting foreign language contracts (don’t underestimate this step—I once lost three precious days to a missing translation).\
Step 6: Final Decision & Enforcement\
Labour Courts generally take 2–4 months to decide, unless the case is complex. Once judgment is issued, enforcement is swift—Bahrain’s courts have digital links to LMRA and Sijilat to freeze or garnish employer assets if needed. Appeals are allowed within 30 days.\
\
Cost Considerations: Filing Labor Disputes in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs of labor disputes in Bahrain.\
- Legal fees: BHD 200–800 for plain disputes. Complex or high-value cases may reach BHD 2000–3500.\
- Translation/Documentation: BHD 25–100, depending on document volume.\
Budget tip: If you file during Ramadan or just before Eid, expect slight delays—but you’ll often pay standard fees as there are fewer new cases filed in these periods.\
See the full breakdown at KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation cost guide.\
\
Regulatory Changes in 2025: What’s New?\
\
Mandatory Mediation Extension: As of March 2025, all labor disputes—regardless of amount—involve at least one formal mediation attempt.\
Online Filing Expansion: All companies, including free zone entities and partnerships, must submit disputes through the Sijilat portal or at Tamkeen centers.\
Instant Case Tracking: Claimants get SMS/email updates on their case progress.\
Electronic Enforcement: Courts now coordinate directly with LMRA, ensuring salary or end-of-service payouts are processed within 10 working days post-verdict.\
\
I once faced an urgent complaint filed over the Sijilat portal during a project crunch. Thanks to digital documentation and prompt notifications, the issue was resolved in three weeks—much faster than pre-2025 averages.\
\
Compliance Tips & Insider Strategies\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation advice for Bahrain labor disputes. to keep payroll, contracts, and leave records audit-ready.\
- Pre-sort digital documents by employee name and year; Sijilat e-filing prefers zipped file uploads.\
Best Office Locations\
\
For faster queues, visit the Labour Office in Hidd Industrial Area or Tamkeen’s branch in Tubli. Manama HQ gets busiest Sunday mornings.\
Online submissions are typically processed faster if filed Sunday–Tuesday before 10:00am.\
\
Avoid Common Mistakes\
\
Mistake: Submitting incomplete documents (especially missing LMRA records or unpaid salary calculations).\
Solution: Double-check with MOICT’s online checklist or use a local business support agency.\
\
Timing Strategy\
\
Filing in early Ramadan or before Bahraini National Day (December 16th) can mean less competition for hearing slots.\
\
Cultural Nuances\
\
Always offer (or accept) coffee or tea at every in-person meeting—it fosters goodwill and sometimes softens negotiation stances.\
\
\
Comparing Bahrain With the UAE & Saudi Arabia: What Sets Bahrain Apart?\
In the UAE, labor disputes often need expensive legal representation—Bahrain’s process is cheaper, more accessible, and usually faster in 2025. Saudi Arabia still requires Arabic-only documentation and frequently slower pre-court mediation.\
Bahrain’s edge:\
- Simple bilingual process (Arabic/English)\
- Faster enforcement via integrated digital platforms (Sijilat, LMRA)\
- Lower filing and legal costs\
(From my experience, dealing with a labor dispute in Dubai involved weeks of scheduling headaches and high translation fees. Bahrain’s streamlined online procedure was strikingly efficient by comparison.)\
\
Professional Support & Resources\
!(\
I always recommend KeyLink’s Bahrain company formation process service, especially for foreign-owned companies or businesses expanding from the UAE/GCC. They’re reliable, handle both filings and follow-ups, and helped me avoid several costly errors.\

\
Tangent: Business Networking in Bahrain—Why It Matters for Labor Disputes\
It might seem off-topic, but here’s a critical truth: Relationships built during majlis meetings or Ramadan suhoor can resolve disputes before they escalate. In Bahrain, proactive networking—even at Tamkeen’s business events or MOICT info sessions—often leads to informal resolutions or insider tips that save time and money.\
\
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\
1. What are the main types of labor disputes in Bahrain?\
The most frequent issues are late salary payments, unlawful termination, and disagreement over end-of-service benefits. For any contract-related question, keep all documentation ready and consult KeyLink’s Bahrain business type structures.\
2. Can expatriates file labor disputes in Bahrain?\
Absolutely. Expats enjoy the same rights as local employees. Many labor disputes involve expatriates, especially in free zone firms. Learn more about foreign ownership and rights here.\
3. How long does a labor dispute case take?\
With the 2025 reforms, most disputes settle at mediation within 2–3 weeks. If it goes to court, 2–4 months is typical. Urgent cases (e.g., unpaid salary for 3+ months) are fast-tracked. Reuters notes Bahrain’s system is now one of the swiftest in the Gulf.\
4. What happens if a company ignores a labor court verdict?\
Non-compliance allows immediate enforcement—courts work with LMRA and Sijilat to freeze assets or block the employer’s commercial registration until payments are made. See commercial registration rules for reference.\
5. Where can I get expert help for labor disputes?\
Use specialized providers like KeyLink’s accounting and legal support, or Tamkeen Business Center for initial guidance. Major law firms in Seef and Diplomatic Area provide legal representation if needed.\
\

I've struggled with anxiety and depression since my teens (I'm 30 now) with a lot of ups and downs, over the last years the downs taking me further and further down each time. I first discovered cumbia when living with latin americans in Spain (I'm also from latin america but from Brazil) and went on to fall in love with it very hard and very suddenly when coming across a group of older people dancing beautifully to cumbia sonidera in a plaza on an amazing visit to Ciudad de Mexico. I thought the pairs dancing together were couples who had been together their whole lives due to the chemistry between them, but then they suddenly switched partners and had the same connection with the new person and I realised nobody knew each other, the sound of the music was just inspiring this in them. This was 3 years ago and since then I've spent a lot of time reading/listening to podcasts about cumbia, searching for subgenres or artists I haven't listen to before, watching documentaries etc

When I'm in a depressive episode it's one of the few things I can still find some enthusiasm for, and every time I've thought that life wasn't worth hanging around for anymore, I've thought about how 'if I hold on until tomorrow, I can have one final morning listening to cumbia while I have my coffee', or 'I should hang around until this weekend so I can go to this show I have tickets for', which gave me time to realise that I was in crisis and that help was available

At first I thought my love for cumbia was just an ADHD hyperfixation but after a few years its still the only thing that gives me this feeling. I'm not entirely sure why. I'd love to one day understand what it is exactly that happens in my brain when I hear the rasping of the guacharaca and immediately enter a place of peace and hope",5,1757532499.0,cumbia,2,1.0,False

I'll have to get detailed about it tho, sorry in advance for the long story.

I've worked at a thrift store as a cashier for 1,5-2 yrs now and was fired a few months ago; due to a personal medical reason which made it hard to do my job.

When i worked there for only a few months i had to deal with shitty customers every now and then, but the one that i'm gonna talk about was smth else! It's the type where you could tell straight from the bat that something wasn't right in the head.

The first time i had to help him out he immediately tried to strike up conversation. Asking me about my hobbies which in itself is pretty innocent, but it was the way he was looking at me which made it obvious he was a creep. 

He also ordered a cup of coffee with toast. Once it was ready the toast should be cut in half and stacked on top of eachother so it'll look more neat, but due to the weight of the sandwich maker it was flat which made it looks like just one sandwich.

I served it to him and he asked me where the other half is, i explained to him that both halves were on the plate and went back to the cash register. The whole time that customers were coming up to me to pay for whatever they thrifted, you could hear him get louder and louder. Asking where the other half was and complaining about it. He got so worked up that he pulled another customer into his little riot! 

He eventually came up to me together with the other customer and they were both steaming mad about ""the other half""! 
Saying that it wasn't customer service and that he's been waiting forever, he got so mad that other colleagues got pulled from the back just to see what's going on. Just for him to pull the two pieces apart and act surprised about it, are you kidding me?!!

After he was done eating he apologized and said  i was a cute girl and wanted to ""make it up to me"". He even used my hobbies to flirt with me, saying he knows a place where i can play the drums. He couldn't get further than that tho, since i acted ditzy and dumb about his intentions. He eventually left.

The next time i ran into him was in the city.
I happened to pass him by, but didn't notice him calling out to me since i had headphones on. You'd think that'd be the end of it, but NO THIS MAN FOLLOWED ME DOWN THE STREET JUST TO TALK TO ME!
He disguised it as an innocent convo at first, but it didn't sit right with me. Eventually he brought up that the girl he was at the thrift store with was just a friend and that he ""isn't  really into relationships"" followed by him trying to ask me out and trying to invite himself to walk with me.

I made up some lie to get him off my back which worked.

Yesterday was the 2nd time i've ran into him. I tend to ignore everyone and everything around me so i didn't even notice it was him in the first place.
Only when he started following me down the street i took notice of him and he tried to strike up a conversation again.
I would've easily kept walking if i didn't know this man is mentally unstable so i felt i had to keep talking to him to appease him.

He asked why he didn't see me at work anymore and asked where i lived as well, so i made up some lies mentioning i lived with a (girl)friend. Just for him to ask if i was gay, why would that even matter to him? 
Furthermore, he noticed my wrist braces and said that a nice girl like me shouldn't wear anything like that and he kept staring at me and basically holding me hostage by talking to me.

I eventually cut him off, telling him i was in a rush and i bolted out of there.

Anyone that has been in the same situation, please tell me how you talked yourself out of it; cuz this is just getting weird to me.

I woke up today by some noises outside, not my alarm, think ""nevermind, I get to have the awesome cake my friend brought me for breakfast today, let's be happy""! Get up, do the stuff, take my meds, have the cake, not feeling very well, but ok, that's mornings for me (I REALLY don't do mornings) - and besides, I got woken up in a bad way. By the time I am leaving for work I feel dreadful, but I really can't avoid going in today. Get there, I feel even worse, have no idea why - then migraine hits me. Ok, now I know why I was feeling that bad, it was the aura before the migraine, but OMG, migraine BAD! I take paracetamol, I take a muscle relaxant (because at my age my neck is always painful and that can lead to headaches), wonder if I should just get straight to the doctor after work and do people even do that (I certainly never have). Get home, take ibuprofen (which I lecture my mom to NOT do over pain, it's an anti-inflammatory), go lie down. NOTHING.

I just went to the kitchen and noticed a dirty glass and the thought hits me... wait, did I have coffee this morning? Check the rest of the dishes in the sink, the house... NOPE! Did NOT have coffee. It's a caffeine withdrawal migraine... This morning I went straight for the cake (""ooh, shiny!!!"") and forgot about coffee existing. Nevermind the fact that I've been drinking coffee every morning since I was 15, never mind the fact that I am physically addicted to caffeine, as my splitting headache reminded me... my ADHD brain does NOT do routines! 

So after failing to get rid of the migraine for the entire day, I just threw a teaspoon of instant coffee in half a glass of water and downed it - didn't even bother to make a proper coffee.

Was it the right thing?","Hi. I’m hoping to get “the other side” of this. My brother “Jack” is married to a woman with BPD “Jill”. Jill is awesome- caring, fun, and humorous. She is also abusive to him- two years ago he called me to travel 3 hours to help him get his stuff after she had been arrested for domesticate violence. She had been destroying everything he cared about, after throwing knives and ceramic coffee cups at him, etc. She was screaming “I will f\*\*\*ing kill you” at him while in the back of the police cruiser. It was rough.

Jack loves Jill, and is also financially dependent on her due to his own illness.

Myself and my family have received harassing emails ever since (we blocked text messages and email, but she created new email addresses). You might imagine, the emails were… horrific. We had trusted her and shared much of our life with her, and she used every bit of this information against us. She was asked (by email) several times to stop contacting us. It never stopped… for over 2 years now.

We have simply ignored the hundreds of messages.

Last week, she threatened to reach out to my place of work. After contacting an attorney friend of mine, I sent a 3-sentence email. Essentially- Stop contacting us, we’ve asked before, and we’ll have to pursue legal action if she continued.

32 emails followed within a few hours, including descriptive death threats to me, my wife, our dog, and threats to show up at my place of work. I pursued a protective order. My brother, “Jack”, is beyond upset. He says that I should have known she wouldn’t follow through, and that I’m destroying their marriage. I‘ve never told him what to do, and I don’t personally dislike her(I sincerely hope she can heal and live a wonderful life). I do believe that these emails come from a place when she is not fully in control. I can understand that… but I also don’t feel I can simply ignore the threats either.

Was/is there another way? Is there anything I can do to be helpful and supportive while not simply allowing death threats against me and my family? I hate that pursuing the protective order is destroying my relationship with my brother, but I just don’t know what else to do. Anyone have guidance?

I have plans for a menu which would cover both morning and afternoon with various types of cold sandwiches, including vegetarian sandwiches, which are very rare here in my area. I plan to just do drip coffee for a start and then graduate to espresso drinks.

My question is this: has anyone run any type of franchise right from the start? I have some friends and a few family members who would also be interested in running a similar business and my thought is that we could just launch a franchise right from the start with shared branding, shared menus, with each location having a little bit of its own flair.

I know each location would have to have their own inspections and adherence to local health codes, which is very important to me. But I wondered if anyone else has tried multiple locations right from the start or early in their business and how that worked out? Or any other advice would be welcome!

1ndngnv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ndngnv,Average Faces,"# Average Faces

224 faces generated per label (46) using Chroma1-HD (fp16). The original average face was used for image to image (i2i) generation. I selected the most congruent faces and projected them onto the original average faces using 68 face-landmarks.

# Process

1. **Generate** Samples based on Original
2. **Select** Candidates from Samples
3. **Project** and blend Candidates onto Original

# Original Average Faces

Average faces have been floating around the internet for years. The original sources are likely faceresearch.org and the work of Lisa DeBruine and their colleagues at University of Glasgow. The images shown here are the ones I found on various websites.

There are certainly fake average faces out there and sometimes mixed into the legitimate ones.

These images are tiny. Typically, the best I was able to extract was around 150x225 pixels. Therefore, using these directly in an image-to-image pipeline requires an absurd amount of denoising steps. I ended up with 64 steps (start 32, end 96) for a 1MP output using Chroma1-HD (fp16). Three different prompts were used, only changing the camera-style, with the sole exception of ""burqa"" for a portion of the generations for Afghanistan and Chad to combat the non-hair coloration.

# Motivation

Many great community finetunes of open-weight models exist, however, many exhibit a strong face bias - they converge on a small set of facial features, e.g. Flux-Face, Pony-Face.

By using an average (or blend of averages by landmark interpolation) as the basis for image-to-image generation and then re-projecting the results back onto the original average, we have a method to:

1. combat the biases, and
2. avoid likeness to real people.

The projection made the jaw wider, the upper lip slimmer, the nose wider, and the eyes slightly smaller. The distortion artifacts are minimal, most noticeable between the upper and lower lip.

# Application

There are many fun and creative applications. The stylized images have been generated using RealCartoon-XL (realcartoonXL\_v7) the prompt for the image was auto-generated by Gemma3:27b (Q8) based on the average face.

# Notes

# Limitations & Methodology

* I wasn't able find averages for *male* faces and I can't confirm the authenticity of the *female* averages.
* To stay true to the original average faces, I have not applied any color correction or other post-processing.
* Unfortunately, the faces were not captured at a constant distance from the camera, therefore the sizes vary. Furthermore, it's not known whether the camera was brought up to eyelevel or angled from a fixed position.
* When projecting the samples onto the original average, each sample was also used in it's mirrored form, so all new averages are perfectly symmetrical.
* When selecting candidates from the generated samples, I used my own human eyeballs. I primarily rejected generations that were distorted, had artifacts, or were otherwise unconvincing, or overall a bad fit for the original average. I accepted a wide range of features, trusting that the projection will bring the features back in line with the original average.
* The landmark detection was done using Dlib's 68 face-landmark model. I used the Python bindings to extract the landmarks and perform the projection. The projection was done using a piecewise affine transformation for each triangle in the Delaunay triangulation of the landmarks.

# Compute

* **Power**: Generating all samples took on the order of 150 RTX 5090 hours (limited to 450W). Therefore approximately *68kWh* were consumed; covered by home solar panels.
* **Water**: Estimated at 4 liters of coffee and 1 pint of DIPA.

# Plans

* Dataset of refined averages may be released on Huggingface.
* Explore more capable landmark models (e.g. Face Mesh), which I tested briefly, but the Dlib model produced convincing results.
* I may try to refine the approach by first normalizing the size of the faces, which is non-trivial as any and all landmarks are a function of the *ethnic* influences and there is no ground truth reference scale.

1ndnde1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1ndnde1/should_you_get_the_best_soda_maker_sodastream/,Should You Get the Best Soda Maker SodaStream Fizzi Review Guide,"Getting my hands on the SodaStream 1101098010 Fizzi was like opening a portal to caffeine-free fizzy drink heaven. I had only dreams of sparkling water on demand, but this sleek little machine made those dreams a reality. Designed compactly (measuring just 9.2 x 11.2 x 17.4 inches) and impressively cordless, it fits snugly on my counter without screaming for attention. It’s light too, weighing just under 11 pounds, so I found it easy to relocate between the kitchen and the patio during weekend hangouts. The black finish has a minimalist vibe, looking effortless in any home setup.

**Highlights**  
The first thing I loved about this sparkling water maker is its convenience. Who knew turning plain old water into a fizzy delight could be this satisfying? I just filled the included BPA-free 1L bottles with chilled water, snapped them into the machine with the easy snap-lock mechanism, pressed the button, and voilà – instant soda water. No electricity needed, which means I’ve taken it outdoors, used it at the park, and even on a camping trip once!  
- Package features (2) 60L CO₂ cylinders and (3) reusable bottles included, eliminating trips back and forth for refills for quite a while.  
- Perfect compatibility with all SodaStream flavor drops, giving me the option to mix up lime, orange, or any other creative combinations I feel like.  
- Each CO₂ cylinder carbonates up to 60L of water, which made me feel like I was stretching every dollar spent.  
[Check SodaStream 1101098010 Fizzi price on Amazon.](https://werdink.com/p/b07dp5941k/)

**Operation Simplicity**  
Setting it up was gloriously hassle-free. Once the cylinder was securely twisted in, the rest was smooth sailing. The snap-lock feature deserves applause—it’s weirdly fun to use but also ensures no spills or mess. The process is fully manual but didn’t feel laborious. This simplicity means my tech-resistant grandmother was able to fizz her water without batting an eye. Operation is consistent, and being cordless only amplified its practicality. It’s the definition of ready-to-use.

**Design and Capacity**  
The SodaStream Fizzi keeps things minimal. Its compact design is a serious space saver, especially if, like me, you’re juggling a coffee maker, toaster, and blender in a small kitchen. Each CO₂ canister carbonates up to 60 liters, so you won’t find yourself swapping cylinders constantly (and trust me, I put this feature to the test with countless sparkling mocktails during a recent party). Also, the included carbonating bottles are far sturdier than disposable ones I’ve used in other machines—it feels earth-friendly and practical.

**Drawbacks**  
Though adventures with this soda maker have been delightful, areas for improvement do exist:  
- The CO₂ refills, while lasting long, can be a bit of a bother to source locally. I’ve started relying on online purchases to keep them on deck.  
- It doesn’t chill the water, so pre-chilling is necessary for that crisp, refreshing taste I prefer.  
- Cleaning the machine itself is simple, but the slender necks of the bottles can make thorough cleaning tricky without a specialized bottle brush.  
- The absence of multiple intensity levels might be a limitation for users wanting heavier carbonation for certain beverages.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the Fizzi to other sparkling water makers like the Aarke Carbonator 3 and the Drinkmate, it holds its own surprisingly well. The Aarke, while undeniably stunning with its all-metal design, is priced on the steeper side, which may deter some budget-conscious users. Drinkmate, on the other hand, has an advantage with its ability to carbonate not only water but also juices, wine, and cocktails, offering versatility. However, where those models start requiring significant counter space or hefty price tags, the Fizzi keeps things affordable, compact, and ultra-accessible without sacrificing quality.

**True Value**  
The price-to-quality ratio of this machine makes it an easy sell. It holds its ground as an energy-efficient, cordless soda maker without needing bells and whistles. Investing in a system like this makes perfect sense if you’re someone who has a regular craving for sparkling water or seltzers. Since using it, I’ve undoubtedly saved money over buying cans or bottles—and the convenience alone is undeniably worth every penny. Also, there’s that satisfying ""pop"" sound every time I hit the carbonation button—it never gets old.

This was in the mid 2000's, so I'm guessing it's a 2000's book. It was a picture book. The cat was orange and might've been named Jack? And there were a boy and girl following it around, a brother and sister. The cat went through town and was causing loads of havoc, eating foods that started with every letter of the alphabet. Then he got all big and fat, of course. It turns out he was a she, and she had kittens. I think they might've called her Jackie instead of Jack at the end because they realized she was a girl? I could have the name wrong. All I know is that the cat definitely had kittens.

The art style was cartoony and 90's-esque? The vibe is similar to a Y2K coffee house or Barnes and Noble aesthetic. Very warm and cozy.

There’s a high DD Theft rate in our area so when Dashers arrive for pickup, We require all Dashers to confirm the order and show us that it’s confirmed. Simple and reasonable right? Well these past weeks I’ve received a couple google reviews claiming they felt discriminated when told to confirm and show order confirmation. As you know bad reviews are very damaging to small businesses. I’ve thought about stopping our whole confirmation requirement and just let the Dashers do whatever. However, the consequences affect our customers experiences. For example, a Dasher picked up an order without confirming. They then proceeded to chill out in the parking lot for about 20 minutes. And no, they didn’t have a double dash order or anything they were simply just chilling out. From a customers perspective on the DoorDash order status, it seems like our place is taking forever to prepare their order when in reality, the Dasher is fooling around and taking forever. When the Dasher finally got around to driving and delivering it, a complaint and refund was filed with us. The customer said their whole entire order was cold. The customer then proceeded to leave a google review stating that everything was cold and not fresh upon delivery. Not only do we risk things like this but we also risk losing our customers due to Dashers being irresponsible. I’m just frustrated because no matter what I do, I lose in every situation. Also I used to DoorDash and a bunch of other places would require the same thing I do and I would never feel discriminated. I’m also aware some restaurants dont care whether Dashers steal or not. For me that’s impossible and detrimental for my small business. My customers experiences are first priority. These discrimination reviews look bad on us and they look bad to new customers wanting to try us out.

Have pregnancy along with support houses set up. Use 3* items

Items needed
couch, phone, toilet, computer, dining table, dining chair, fridge, bathtub, stereo, magazines, stove, bookcase, coffee pot(some items used for Simchase)

Begin at time that works for you as starts 24hrs to complete goals. You can click crib to see how many hours until baby comes. 

DO NOT JUMP IN IMMEDIATELY! Takes only few minutes check time of each pregnant task and plan accordingly.

Pregnant sim has 6 daily tasks to complete in 24hrs. Breaks down to 3 long task(2hrs+) and 3 shorter task one of which is usually few seconds. The other two can usually use ads to speed up. (Note last two days usually involve longer task) 
 
If you have a job then start longest task before going to work. Try checking in at lunch or break and start next longest task. When get home do shorter tasks and leave longest task for overnight. (This is why starting at time that works for you is important)

For those of you with Golden Bonus sims you can pair them with an OG(sims no bonus) and time used will be Golden time.

Support Sims
Only need to do 3 support task a day to keep pace with pregnant sim. Each task is 4%-5%. No need to stress or worry if completing at least three a day. 

If you do more you’ll finish before pregnant sim. Doing 3 task a day frees up sims to help with other events or go to work. 

Do set timers and pay attention when goes off.

There’s no reason to not to get bonus unless unorganized. The first day sets up the rest so plan accordingly. 

Remember you don’t have to start event day it comes out. If need to wait couple days due to events or IRL it’s fine as long as start event before ends. This is one event that has some flexibility so make the most of it. ⚡️👶🍀

He did heavily emphasize that ""it is very very new"" and ""I don't know if anything will come out of it"" and ""you are one of the first friends I tell to"", and ""I tell this to you because I think it is fair"".Then he went to say that he should probably stop all intimate contact with me, but continued to explain to me how much he will miss it, and miss me, how amazing I am and how there are so many things he wishes he would have done with me and maybe I can share one more fantasy with him. I told him ""I understand. I want you to be happy although I am sad it is not with me. And I probably should not share anymore fantasies because of this"".

What I said made him come closer to me and kissed me. We did sleep together again. He went through all the best memories he has of me, things he wished we could have done etc. It lasted for hours, and in the end he laid with his head on my chest and I think he cried. He left home after midnight, and when he got home texted me ""don't stop sharing your fantasies, I want to hear them"".

The next two days he bombed me with messages. Invited me to visit his place just 10 hours after all this went down, and I did drop by and he was casual and friendly and hugged me goodbye. Then kept texting me that day about random things. He drove me to work on Monday, and had coffee with me. Invited me to lunch the same day, which I also went to. He seemed kind and cheerful.

After lunch? Nothing. Just vanished again.

  
I keep trying to understand what that glitch was. I haven't tried to reach out, neither has he.

  
I try to keep it to myself how hurtful it is to say one is not ready for a relationship, and then jump into a new one. I have to fight the urge to ask how well he has healed from his unhealthy behaviors while sleeping with an ex while trying to date someone new.

I'm not really mad at him, I'm sad for him and still care a lot. I wish I didn't, but I don't know how to stop caring. I don't know how to move on, I don't even know how to start. I know I seem pathetic, but I still somehow wish I could find a way to fix this all.",1,1757530953.0,AvoidantBreakUps,2,1.0,False

Baby was born 6/4, gaining weight great, EBF. Around 7/10, baby started having green, mucusy poops. Initially, our pediatrician said green was fine..on 7/18, we saw blood in baby's stools, confirmed by occult test. I went dairy and soy free starting 7/19 (I know the group recommends one allergen at a time, I was following the pediatrician's advice). On 8/1 I realized my prenatal had soybean oil, so I only technically started soyfree on 8/2. 

Baby's symptoms were green, stinky stools, extreme difficulty pooping and related fussiness, some arching at the beast. 

By day 3-4 DF, baby started being able to poop unassisted. By ~3 weeks DF, starting on 8/7, her poop became consistently yellow. Her poop is still runny, and has varying degrees of mucus. We've seen trace amounts of blood on 8/4 and 8/9. 

On 9/4 there was a single small string of red blood in her diaper. Then again on 9/7, 9/8, 9/9, 9/10 - all miniscule amounts of blood, that I have to examine the diaper to see, but definitely present, along with mucus. Her poop is also stinky, but that has never changed. 

Could it be because of straining, or is it an indication of another trigger? I've essentially been eating the same few things and meals consistently for the last 7 weeks, and haven't had anything new in the past few days. I also haven't had any take out, gone to any restaurants, or had takeout coffee since going DF, with the exception of a plain bagel that I confirmed was dairy and soy free with the owner of the place. 

The only thing I can think of, is that since going dairy free I have probably been consuming a lot more oats and chicken than I was previously. Think, oat milk latte every morning, heavenly hunks, and oat balls daily, plus oat meal some times. Chicken is my main source of protein, breakfast sausages most mornings and chicken breast for like 80% of lunches and dinners. 


Thoughts? I'm feeling really discouraged since I know red blood = new blood :( My baby is happy, growing (2lbs/month during the first two months, just over a pound in the third month), meeting all milestones.",2,1757530892.0,MSPI,4,1.0,False

She was still upset about the death and initially reluctant to speak with me but with the mention of Donovan Whitmore she let me in. Per her testimony it echoed the police report and findings. She however recalled an incident approximately 2 weeks earlier where a painting arrived for Mrs. Whitmore. She says that she barely got a look at the painting, it was a ballerina in black. Mrs. Whitmore became upset and ordered her to throw it away. Mrs. Santos did not throw away the painting but thought it was too beautiful and instead kept it. Mrs. Santos then showed me the painting and I took several photos of it for Mr. Whitmore.

After a few days negotiation Elena Miles arranged for me to meet Vincent Monroe in his New York City penthouse today. Personal note. Mr. Monroe is clearly a wealthy and successful painter. The rent on this place has got to be three month’s pay for me. Vincent Monroe invited me in and was not what I expected. He was warm and gracious and humble. Saying that he just loved his art and was very glad and appreciative that his patrons were generous and loved his art as well. He did not know the name of the person who commissioned the painting but they did have some very exact details they wanted. I’ve made a photo of the note. During the interview Mr. Monroe spoke about his process and inspirations. At one point he picked up a palette knife and he turned quickly towards me but, he set it down again and continued talking. At this point I have no reason to suspect him of wrongdoing. I don’t know. Something is off.

Raymond Miller, Tuesday, January 7, 2025. Utica, NY. Residence of Frank Monroe. I attempted to find Mr. Monroe but there was no answer at the door. The residence and hallway were in squalid conditions and smelled of urine and fried fish. Proceeded to canvas the neighborhood and visited several bars. In the fourth one I found Mr. Monroe when a bartender pointed him out. Time has not treated the man well. His drinking had made his features almost unrecognizable. I had the bartender make some coffee and after some coaxing he consumed it and began to rouse. When he was sufficiently alert I explained who I was and what I was doing. At the mention of his son he became enraged and I left before it escalated. I will try again. Meanwhile I am staying at a local hotel and waiting to hear from my contact in the department to see if he can get a hold of the case record for Vincent Monroe. Personal note, get new shirt.

Raymond Miller, Thursday, January 16, 2025. Utica, NY. I’ve reviewed the investigative file from the Vincent Monroe case. In my professional opinion, this was sloppy work and calling it an investigation is the punch line of a bad joke. Namely they saw the grieving family, saw the graffiti next to the victim and called it a day. And justice for all.

Raymond Miller, Friday January 17, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Today I was able to speak with Mr. Monroe. He recognized me from the other night and was about to close the door on me when I told him I found more evidence in his son’s murder. He let me in and I observed the squalid conditions in which he lived, a single naked bulb hung from the ceiling and a dirty stained mattress lay in the corner. No discernible source of income. We stood in his kitchen as there was nowhere to sit but on the floor. I declined his offer of a drink. Fearing another outburst I did not mention his son’s name directly. Instead I explained what brought me here. Mr. Monroe did not understand what any of this had to do with him or his family. I told him of the painter Vincent Monroe and that seemed to confuse him. He told me his son had died, murdered by “those hateful bastards.” To deescalate him I asked about his other son Stephen. This elicited a dismissive waive from him. He said the, “big war hero, ran away instead of helping.” He would not elaborate. I asked about Mrs. Monroe and he said, “the stress of it was too much for her.” He began sobbing and asked me to leave. I left Mr. Monroe in his agitated state seeing my further presence was provoking him.

Raymond Miller, February 4, 2025. I’ve spent the past few weeks combing through newspaper reports on the hate crimes in the area. Almost all of the murders happened in one location none of them where the Monroe murder happened. Enough about the crimes and motives were leaked to the press and they do not match what happened to the Monroe boy. The scene, method and COD were all different. Something is definitely rotten in Denmark. Time to visit Frank Monroe again. 

**Document 33:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, Thursday February 6, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Mr. Monroe looked slightly better today. Had my visit changed his routine? I decided to hit him with what I know to gauge his reaction. I told him about the other murders, I told him about how his son’s murder did not fit. I pointedly asked him what happened that night. At this time Mr. Monroe became agitated again and attacked me. I restrained him without harming him. In his struggle I was able to overpower and pin him. He broke down completely and told me of his wife’s suicide after losing both sons. He told me how he had found Stephen in his brother’s studio dressed in brother’s clothes, speaking like him and painting as if nothing was wrong. When Mr. Monroe confronted him and Stephen flew off into a rage and left the house never to be seen again. He told me that for years he drank to silence “them”, but he never said who they were and when I pressed, he started screaming, “I killed my son. Is that what you want to hear? I killed my son you son of a bitch” I immediately left and fled the scene hearing his screams. I didn’t know what else to do.

Re: Query

Mr. Miller, 

From what you've described, this sounds like severe trauma induced dissociation. The behavior you mentioned, assuming his brother's identity, suggests a complete break from reality following the loss. Both the individual and family members may experience different manifestations of grief and trauma. The father's reference to 'silencing them' could indicate guilt, self-blame, or possibly substance-induced paranoia. I'd recommend extreme caution. You are dealing with someone who has experienced profound psychological trauma. If you do reach out to Stephen, be very careful his response may be violent.

Stephen Monroe just left my apartment. I don’t know how he found where I lived or how he got in but woke with him standing over me with a weapon. He, he, just wanted to talk. He asked me who I was and why did I want to speak with him. I reached for my weapon but he had already taken it. I told him what he wanted to know. I told him I understand, I told him how my own brother was murdered in prison. He then told me that he’d let me live if I continued to search for his brothers killer. He wanted to know if I could have saved Jared and I admitted that I could not. Then he left. He wore a mask but I’d recognize those eyes anywhere. Vincent and Stephen Monroe are the same person. 

**Document 39:** **Dictated voice notes of Ray Miller**

Raymond Miller, March 25, 2025. Utica, NY, Frank Monroe residence. Mr. Monroe slammed the door closed once he saw who I was. I yelled that I knew where Stephen was and once again he let me in. He asked many questions and I explained what I knew leaving out the murder that originally brought me here. Thankfully he did not remember. I once again pressed him for what happened that night and again he grew enraged and said, “How many times do I need to say, I killed my son. I killed my son.” In light of this revelation I believe that Mr. Frank Monroe killed his youngest son and staged the scene to cover his crime. I can only do one thing with this information.

Ray, I saw Frank Monroe’s name on the wire. Frank Monroe, 58, found dead 3 days ago in his Utica apartment. Choked on his own vomit. Neighbors said he’d been drinking heavily for years. That the same Monroe cold case you were looking into?

Mr. Miller,

That night I observed you. I almost ended our conversation abruptly, but curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad we spoke, for I have found in you another. I only end conversations abruptly with those deserving such treatment. And if my client hadn’t stepped out of line we’d not be having this conversation. Vincent is an innocent and will remain that way. For what are big brothers for? I received your findings. We will not meet again. Thank you.

Dear Sir, 

I want to thank you for all the years of working with you. It has been a pleasure but due to recent events and the investigation into Mrs. Whitmore’s death I have failed. I am hereby resigning effective immediately. The recent months have brought to light memories I wished to forget and they are too much to continue working with you. I started this investigation looking for answers but instead I found no killer, no monsters, no real answers, only victims.

1ndmz5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ndmz5q/explore_if_the_koios_hb8803_hand_blender_is_worth/,Explore if the KOIOS HB-8803 Hand Blender is worth buying in this review!,"Testing out the KOIOS HB-8803 Immersion Blender has been quite an adventure in my culinary journey. This 3-in-1 hand blender comes with a whisk, milk frother, and a powerful 1000W motor, making it an incredibly versatile tool in the kitchen. The sleek black finish, the BPA-free materials, and its compact, portable style make it feel premium yet practical. As someone who cooks daily, I was intrigued to see if this blender would live up to the hype, and I was pleasantly surprised. However, there are a few things to consider before making it your go-to kitchen companion. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
One of the first things that struck me was the solid, weighty feel of the handheld blender. The ergonomic design made it comfortable to hold, even during extended use. The 304 stainless steel blades feel sturdy and high-quality, and the protective anti-splash guard is a small but valuable addition for those of us who dread cleaning up splatter messes. At just over 2 pounds, it’s lightweight enough for my teenage niece to use comfortably, yet it doesn’t feel flimsy in any way. While I appreciated the high-end materials, I did notice the push-button controls could be a little stiff at times, especially when you're mid-blend and need to change speeds.

**Performance and Speed Options**  
Power is where this product truly shines. Most immersion blenders I’ve used fall in the 300-500W range, but this one packs a huge 1000W punch. During my tests, it blended smoothies, soups, and even thick peanut butter mixtures effortlessly. Want to make a velvety tomato soup? No problem. In the mood for a frothy coffee on a lazy morning? The milk frother attachment works like magic. The 12-speed settings offer a level of precision that’s rare in blenders at this price range. Plus, the turbo mode is perfect for tough ingredients like frozen fruit chunks. Still, if you’re a beginner, figuring out which speed to use can be slightly confusing.

[Check KOIOS HB-8803 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0dhgtfbny/)

**Convenience Features**  
Cleaning up after cooking is one of my least favorite chores, but this immersion blender makes life a little easier. The detachable parts are dishwasher safe (except the engine section), which is a lifesaver. It’s a breeze to detach and rinse off right after use, though I recommend doing so immediately to avoid any stubborn food remnants. Also, all components that come into contact with food are made of non-BPA materials, a feature particularly important when cooking for kids. 

**Highlights**  
- Powerful 1000W Copper Motor for seamless blending.  
- 12 adjustable speeds for versatile tasks.  
- Anti-scratch blade guard to protect cookware.  
- Dishwasher-safe components for easy cleanup.

**Areas of Concern**  
Despite the many benefits, there were a few issues I encountered:  
- The turbo button requires more force than I’m comfortable with during extended blending.  
- Changing speeds while blending could feel smoother.  
- Lacks a storage case, meaning attachments can be easy to misplace.  

**Peer Products**  
In the crowded hand blender market, the KOIOS HB-8803 has some tough competitors, like the Braun MQ505 Multiquick Hand Blender and Breville BSB510XL. While the Braun blender has an equally ergonomic design and is slightly more affordable, it doesn’t offer as many speed settings, limiting its precision. Breville, on the other hand, feels comparable in power but comes at a higher price point without offering something remarkably better. The KOIOS blender strikes a perfect balance of performance, features, and price, making it ideal for most home cooks unless you value brand prestige over functionality.

**Smart Spending**  
When evaluating cost efficiency, the KOIOS HB-8803 feels like incredible value for the range of features it offers. You’re getting a powerful motor, multiple speed settings, and versatile attachments—all wrapped in a design that feels much more expensive than what it costs. While I wouldn’t call it a luxurious product, it certainly feels like it. For the functionality it brings to my kitchen, it’s well worth the investment.

1ndmyk8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1ndmyk8/should_you_buy_the_best_personal_blender_ninja/,Should You Buy the Best Personal Blender Ninja QB3001SS Review,"I’ve been getting a lot of use out of the Ninja QB3001SS personal blender, and I gotta say, as someone who enjoys daily smoothies and quick meal prep, this compact machine has slid right into my kitchen routine without a hitch. At first glance, it may not seem like anything too special, but it's honestly surprised me in a lot of ways. My mornings are usually rushed, and having a portable blender that’s simple to use and effective feels like a small win every day. 

**Compact Yet Powerful Design**  
This thing is deceptively small, which I personally love because countertop space in my house is basically a luxury. It’s lightweight at just over three pounds, and its sleek vertical build saves space without looking out of place next to my coffee maker. Despite the compact size, it houses a 700-watt motor that packs enough power to chop through just about anything I’ve thrown at it. From frozen strawberries to almonds for shakes, the motor doesn’t disappoint. Plus, the black finish gives it a modern look that blends well with my other appliances.

**User-Friendly Functionality**  
One of the features that stood out to me is the simplicity of its design. You literally just push the cup into the base to blend—no complicated buttons, settings, or multiple programs to figure out. This is a godsend when I’m half-asleep in the morning. I’ve used high-end blenders before that bombard you with so many modes, and honestly, most of them feel unnecessary. This blender is refreshingly straightforward, and yet manages to deliver consistent results every time.  

[Check Ninja QB3001SS price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b01fhowya2/)  

**Upsides**  
- It’s incredibly easy to clean since all the parts—cups, lids, and blade assembly—are dishwasher safe. After blending, I appreciate not having to stand over the sink scrubbing bits of spinach out of corners.  
- The inclusion of two 16-oz. Nutri Ninja single-serve cups is super thoughtful. I can prepare a smoothie for both myself and my partner or just prep one ahead of time without hassle.   
- The Pulse Technology extracts nutrients well, blending whole fruits, veggies, seeds, and even tough leafy greens into smooth textures. No chunks in your drink!  
- Frozen ingredients? Crushed ice? No problem. It’s versatile enough to double as a frozen drink maker or milkshake blender.  

**Drawbacks**  
That said, there are a couple of quirks to this blender.  
- While the motor does handle most blending tasks well, I noticed that it struggles a bit with larger frozen chunks or very thick mixtures. You have to shake the cup a bit to help it out.  
- It’s not exactly quiet. The power is fantastic, but the trade-off is a noise level that may test your patience early in the morning or irritate anyone else in the house.  

**Good Points for Active Lifestyles**  
Something I didn’t realize I needed until I had it was the spout lid accessory. After blending, I can just throw the lid on and take my shake out the door without dirtying another container. You wouldn’t believe how much time that saves on busy mornings. Whether you’re heading to the gym or running errands, it’s convenient to have a blender that doubles as an on-the-go cup system.  

**Recipe Inspiration and Flexibility**  
Another cool addition is the little recipe guide that comes with the blender, which I’ll admit I chuckled at initially—but ended up using more than I expected! It’s perfect if you’re looking for some smoothie or shake ideas beyond your usual banana-and-berries routine. I even tried blending up a quick fruit sauce for pancakes, and it worked better than expected. I wouldn’t recommend this for blending soups or anything hot, though, as it’s clearly designed more for cold applications.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
In this price range, you’ve got a few competitors like Nutribullet and Magic Bullet. Compared to Nutribullet, which also has powerful motors, the Ninja QB3001SS feels more lightweight and portable. However, Nutribullet offers more capacity and additional milling functions, which might appeal to bakers or those who do meal prep on a larger scale. Magic Bullet, on the other hand, is cheaper but doesn’t have the motor strength to handle frozen ingredients as reliably as the Ninja. Where Ninja excels is in its ability to combine compactness with real power, making it the better option for small households or active individuals.  

**True Value**  
For what it offers, this blender hits a sweet spot between affordability and performance. While it can’t replace a full-scale kitchen blender for heavy-duty tasks like making batters or blending large quantities, that's not what it aims to do. This is for someone (like me) who wants a quick and efficient solution for personal smoothies, protein shakes, and simple recipes—and it nails these areas perfectly. Given the features, it feels worth every penny. In fact, it’s ended up saving me money long-term by helping me skip my overpriced café smoothie habit.

I thought he would help more as they got older since he couldn't breastfeed and wasn't comfortable changing diapers but he doesn't know what school they go to or what their teachers names are.

I’m pretty new to specialty coffee—only started messing with pour-overs a few months ago and quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing. Ratios, bloom times, pour patterns… felt like I was drowning in variables.

So, being a dev, I built an app to help me figure it out. It’s called [**Cofy Cat**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cofy-cat/id6751729402).

# What it does

* Step-by-step water animations so I don’t mess up timing
* Recipe tracking with exact ratios so I can actually repeat the good ones
* Taste notes with sliders (still not sure I understand what “body” means)
* Brew summaries that look like receipts (kinda fun)
* Works with V60, Chemex, Aeropress, and probably more as I keep learning

# Learning side

* Logs beans, roaster, origin, processing (I had to Google “anaerobic”)
* History + ratings so I can see if I’m actually improving
* Simple profile stats to keep track of total brews and patterns

Right now it’s iOS only (Android soon). It’s free—I’m more interested in feedback than anything.

So, for those of you who know way more than me:

* What features would actually help you?
* What mistakes do beginners usually make that an app could prevent?
* What am I probably doing wrong without even realizing it?

Would love to hear your thoughts. I’ve already learned a ton just lurking here.

TL;DR: Newbie dev made a free iOS brewing app (Cofy Cat) to stop wasting good beans. Looking for feedback from people who actually know what they’re doing.

1ndmozv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cartalk/comments/1ndmozv/did_i_fail_as_a_good_samaritan_leaving_this/,"Did I fail as a good Samaritan, leaving this person on the side of the road? How could I have fixed this?","I write this story with a heavy heart and feeling guilty.



Last night I was driving home on a 500 miles trip with about 100 miles to go. It was around 1:00 am, and I was needing to take a break and stretch, so I pulled into a rest area off of I-20 near Dallas. As I pulled in, I noticed a man that was getting up off the ground, and at first I thought he was drunk and had passed out. I stayed in my truck and observed for a while to get an assessment of the situation. Eventually, I realized the man was disabled and had a cast on one of his legs. He hobbled slowly over to his car, and I could see that he had a flat tire and was trying to put on his spare, but was not strong enough to break the lugs and had found a rock to bang the tire iron with, which is what he was doing on the ground when I first saw him.



As soon as I realized the situation, I got out and approached them man to see if he wanted my help. The man had clear health issues and was visibly in distress. He was glad to let me help and asked me if I had a hammer to help him break his lug nuts with. I told him I had something far better; I had an electric impact wrench.



In my truck I carry quite an array of emergency tools for my own-self and to also offer help to people in need. I have this cool kit that includes a heavy duty electric jack that doubles as an air compressor, and the kit includes this amazing electric impact wrench that makes getting even the hardest lugs off a breeze. So, I was sure that I could get this man fixed up.



I first tried airing up his tire, only to find it had too fast of a leak to hold air. Then I got ready to get his tire off. After hooking my electric impact wrench to his car battery, I went to find the correct socket to fit his lugs, and that is when I saw it. The dreaded KEYED lug nut. I asked the man if he had keyed lug socket, and he did not even know what I was talking about. I spent the next half an hour searching every conceivable place in his car where it could be, and it was nowhere to be found. That is when I had to give him the bad news that I had no way to get his tire off.



The man seemed so desperate that it was almost like he could not hear what I was saying. He begged me not to leave him stranded there, and then hobbled off to the cars of other people asking to borrow their keyed lug socket, even after I tried to explain to him that they are all unique, and they would not work. I did not know what to do. I just waited for over half an hour for him to give up and come back.



When he finally came back, I explained to him that he needed professional help and if he did not have any other person to call, he could call the 800 number on the back of his Texas driver's license to get help. He said that his phone was dead and asked if he could charge it in my truck before I left. I went and got my $40 charger and cord and just gave it to him and said, ""You need this a whole lot more than I do."" I apologized profusely for not being able to more, but it felt like for hollow and useless words to say to someone who was in real need.



Driving away and leaving that man there was one of the hardest things I have had to do. It ripped my heart out. I felt like a complete failure. Not only because I was not able to help him, but because I did not know HOW to help him. A deep anger against these stupid keyed lug nuts started brewing in my heart. I mean, when the heck do they put these things on budget cars with cheap OEM rims anyway? Is there really a rash of thieves stealing old tires on cheap rims? I mean, I could understand if you had a $4,000 set of custom rims and tires on your car, but OEM rims on a Hyundai Accent? Come on, son!



I don't know if it was the fact that I had only had four hours sleep in the last 48 hours and was mentally exhausted, or that I had a quart of Arizona green tea with gensing and a 24 oz cup of coffee in me, but I started crying as drove away. I am still bothered by it today, and I would just like to hear from some car and tire experts if there was any way around this problem. Is there some trick to getting these lugs off that I did not think of. I am pretty good at MacGyvering myself around problems, but I could not think of anything I could do on the side of the road last night. How do tire shops get these things off without damaging the rim?

1ndmlef,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ndmlef/deception_novel_by_aleatha_romig_free_read_online/,Deception Novel by Aleatha Romig Free Read online," Her damn vibrator was still on the bed. It was bad enough that someone had been in our apartment. I couldn’t leave it there for Deloris or her team to dust. I lifted the purple silicone-covered shaft. It was curved and smooth. My thoughts went to the delicious ways I could use it on Charli. I imagined her moans and screams as I pushed the buttons. There was a music option that would allow the device to respond to my voice. She should be in my bed—in our bed—and with words and this stupid toy I should be taking her to new heights.  
  
  The room came into focus, but I wasn’t seeing what was really there.  
  
  I was seeing what wasn’t.  
  
  Her delicate hands were bound with an intricate winding of satin and secured above her head. Her beautiful hair was piled high, and stray auburn wisps surrounding her face contrasted with her flushed complexion. My chest heaved as her sexy body was displayed—each curve, each angle—for my optimum viewing pleasure. In my imagination she was nude, except for the black shoes she’d worn to Mobar, the same shoes that had adorned the dashboard of the Boxster. Her ankles were untethered, bound only by my instructions. Her legs were spread, slightly bent, with her knees out and the heels of her sexy shoes threatening to perforate the soft Egyptian threaded sheets. As the humming vibrations rippled through the air, her body trembled in anticipation, and she stifled a whimper. I loved the way she squirmed as she fought between maintaining the position I demanded and her body’s natural reactions.  
  
  My lips quirked as I added a satin blindfold to my fantasy. It was something we’d never done, but then again, we’d never played with her vibrator either. Without sight, her senses would be heightened. The quiet hum would be louder, a roar in the otherwise silence of our room. My words would be amplified, sending shockwaves from her ears to her pussy that clenched and dripped with unmet need.  
  
  I’d tease her mercilessly, giving her small tastes of what was to come.  
  
  Then I remembered my earlier directives. I’d told her that I’d bring her dinner. The lack of sight would affect that too. Nibbles of the food that Lana had prepared would be just enough to provide the energy she’d need for our night of fun, but never enough to satisfy.  
  
  Keeping her wanting and deprived would be my goal, until it wasn’t.  
  
  It wouldn’t be only her swollen clit or glistening silky folds that would tell me of her wonton desires, her fragrance would fill the air until she couldn’t take it anymore and submitted to words, asking, begging, and finally demanding relief. The purple shaft would bring her some, but only as much as I allowed. It wouldn’t be enough.  
  
  “Your cock. Stop being a dick. I want your cock, now!”  
  
  A full-on smile graced my lips at the imaginary dialogue. It was as if I almost heard her voice, the way it cracked with urgency and determination.  
  
  “Lennox, I have my team on their way.”  
  
  Deloris’s voice from the living room pulled me from my fantasy as reality fell hard upon my shoulders. I hit the switch again, stopping the hum as the erection my thoughts had created quickly faded. By the time I had a few clothes packed and the vibrator stowed within its case in a drawer, my physical response was completely gone.  
  
  Just like my dreams.  
  
  Just like Charli.  
  
  “YOU KNOW YOU can’t leave him,” Patrick said as he squeezed my knee. “I can tell you’re upset. I don’t know what he did, but you simply can’t. It’s not allowed.”  
  
  I twisted the stem of the wine glass, the red liquid swirling within the globe. Thankfully, Cy wasn’t home and it was just Patrick and I. “Thanks for letting me borrow your gym shorts and t-shirt.”  
  
  He laughed. “Besides the fact that you kind of look like they’re swallowing you whole, you look cute. I don’t often get to see a beautiful woman wearing my clothes.”  
  
  I looked up through my damp lashes as his words tugged my lips into a small smile. “Beautiful? Yeah, I feel gorgeous right now.”  
  
  “Well, you’ve got the too-big clothes going for you, plus the red blotchy thing and puffy eyes. A little snot as you sniffle. Little cousin, you’re dazzling.”  
  
  I sighed. “Can I just stay here for a day or two and figure things out?”  
  
  “You know you can. I don’t even need to ask Cy. You’re always welcome, but what about your apartment?”  
  
  My shoulders moved up and down. “I told Chelsea she could stay there. She’s flying from California at the end of this week. I hate to get all settled only to have her displace me. Besides, I feel like I’d be on display there.”  
  
  “Display?”  
  
  “It’s a security thing. I’m kind of over it.”  
  
  Pat leaned back against the couch. “I had a good feeling seeing you with Lennox. Besides, you have that whole one-week history…” He fingered the rim of his wine glass, and I tried to ignore how it reminded me of my martini glass only hours before. “I’m sure you can work through this.”  
  
  “He has my number.”  
  
  “If these were normal circumstances, I’d tell you to forget all about him. I mean, who needs someone like Lennox Demetri? I can only imagine it’d be awful to have a boyfriend who redecorates a room for you, practically weeks after you move in. One who cares enough about your dreams to pay for your education and buy you whatever you want or need, one who gives you the ability to tell Uncle Alton and Aunt Adelaide to stick their conditions up their tight asses. And girl, his looks. Damn, nobody wants to put up with those sexy blue eyes. I mean the way they light up when you walk into a room and he looks at you like he’d eat you whole. I can see how that would get old fast.” He took a drink of his wine. “Honestly, I’m not sure how you managed to stay for this long.” He shrugged. “There’s always good ole Bryce.”  
  
  I sat forward, put my wine glass on the coffee table, and after placing my elbows on my knees, cradled my head. “I don’t need Bryce. Why do I need a man?”  
  
  “If you don’t know the answer to that question, my opinion of Lennox Demetri has just plummeted. I mean, I’m sure you have a vibrator.”  
  
  I sighed. The thought of the purple shaft tore at my heart. I looked up. “Pat, I should get some sleep. I have class early in the morning, and I’m sure you’ve got work.”  
  
  Setting his wine glass next to mine, he reached for my hand and turned it over. With his other hand, he gently touched my wrist. Unknowingly, I gasped and sucked my upper lip between my teeth as his fingers caressed my tender skin.  
  
  Suddenly all playfulness was gone from his expression. “Did he hurt you?”  
  
  I pulled my hand free. “No.”  
  
  “Alex, this is something totally different. I mean, the agreement has one out, and if your wrist is bruised.” He stood. “If that bastard—”  
  
  “Stop, Pat. Nox didn’t hurt me.”  
  
  “You what…” he asked incredulously, “…ran into a wall? Maybe you tripped?”  
  
  “No. None of those things. You’re wrong.”  
  
  He shook his head. “When you first got here, I thought you were mad. You weren’t mad. You were scared. You’re scared of him, aren’t you?”  
  
  Am I?  
  
  “No,” I said sitting taller. “I’m not. He didn’t hurt me, not physically. It’s about trust.” I stood, picked up my wine glass, took a long sip, and paced to the windows. With my back toward him, I asked, “How much does Cy know about you?”  
  
  I almost heard him shrug. “He knows me better than anyone.”  
  
  I turned. “Does he know what the girls said about you at academy?”  
  
  “That I’m great in bed?” he asked with a smirk.  
  
  “That you used them. All you wanted to do was get in their pants and move on.”  
  
  “It doesn’t take your friend Chelsea with a psychology degree to figure out that I was in denial.”  
  
  “That’s what I mean. Does Cy know about you?”  
  
  “We’ve talked. He’s older. It was tough for him to come out too.” Patrick shrugged. “He doesn’t talk about it much, but he was married, to a woman,” he added.  
  
  “Did they have children?”  
  
  “No. It  
didn’t last very long. You don’t know what it’s like…”  
  
  My chest grew tight, listening to him discuss his own struggles both as a teenager and a young adult. We were pretty close in our young teens, yet I didn’t know. It was but another shadow that lurked the hallways of Montague Manor, dancing in the darkness around the Fitzgeralds. Despite Patrick’s insecurities, he always appeared the opposite: cocky and self-assured.  
  
  I settled back onto the sofa.  
  
  When he was done, he asked, “Did you never suspect?”  
  
  I nodded. “I did. I remember hating the things other girls said about you. With our age difference, I usually heard secondhand rumors, but it never seemed like the Patrick Richardson they described was my Pat.”  
  
  He smiled a weary smile. “I always loved you.”  
  
  “Past tense?”  
  
  “No. I mean when it was just the two of us, I didn’t feel the need to overcompensate. We existed in our own world whether at Montague Manor or at my house.” He shrugged. “It wasn’t as if our parents gave a rat’s ass what we did, as long as we didn’t interrupt whatever they were doing.” A smile grew on his face, causing his cheeks to rise. “The only one who knew what we were up to was Jane.”  
  
  The mention of her name loosened the boa constrictor I’d had wrapped around my chest and I grinned.  
  
  “The best part of my childhood,” I said with a sigh. “She’s still at the manor.”  
  
  “Really? I would’ve thought after you moved away…”  
  
  “I get the feeling she takes care of Momma.”  
  
  “That’s good. Aunt Adelaide needs someone in her corner.” His gaze narrowed. “Speaking of running into walls, I remember more than once when she’d been pretty clumsy.” He nodded his head toward my wrists. “I don’t want the same for you.”  
  
  Indignation rose. “Neither do I. Don’t worry about that. Nox would never—”  
  
  “I don’t know him that well,” he interrupted. “But I do know Spence. I never understood why you dated him for so long.”  
  
  Maybe it was the wine or my crying, but I didn’t understand the connection. “What do you mean? We were young.”  
  
  “But you’ve never really liked him.”  
  
  My shoulders sank. “I did… like him… as a friend. When we were young, other than you, he was the only one I ever saw, the only person close to my age. I was surrounded by stuffy adults. Jane was my nanny and playmate, but it wasn’t the same as being around kids. Since Momma and Suzanna were so close, Bryce was there a lot.”  
  
  He nodded. “I remember being thrilled when we’d go to your place and he wasn’t there. I think I even asked my mom once if he lived there.”  
  
  “See? He was my best friend.”  
  
  “Until he was your boyfriend.”  
  
  The thought churned the wine in my stomach. Bryce was my best friend. Isn’t that what a lover should be? Nox and I had never been friends. Maybe that was why I was able to walk away today, or was it yesterday? I picked up my phone lying upon the table. I swiped the screen to the clock—after midnight—and the icon that displayed missed calls.  
  
  I sucked in my breath. I’d had the ringer off. I’d told Nox the ball was in his court, and then I wasn’t there when he lobbed it back.  
  
  I hit the small icon. Two missed calls—Deloris and Bryce.  
  
  The boa squeezed tighter. Nox hadn’t tried to call.  
  
  A tear escaped my eye as I brushed it away.  
  
  I would call Deloris tomorrow… and Bryce?  
  
  What should I say? Hey, Bryce, I got your letter and it worked. I left Lennox. According to you, I’m safe. However, that’s only true if death by broken heart wasn’t possible.  
  
  I looked up to Patrick’s expectant expression. “Tell me he called. He did, didn’t he?”  
  
  My head moved from side to side. “Not him, his…” What was Deloris? “…assistant called.”  
  
  “Oh, yes. A woman—she said her name was Witt—called while you were changing clothes. I’m so sorry I forgot.”  
  
  “She called you?”  
  
  “Yes, she wanted to be sure you were here.”  
  
  I sighed and leaned back. “It’s suffocating, the driver-slash-bodyguard constant surveillance. I hate it.”  
  
  Ignoring my pleas to retire, Patrick poured more wine into our glasses. “I’d guess it has to do with his wife.”  
  
  “What?”  
  
  “What?” His eyes opened wide as he shifted on the couch. It was like Christmas-time secrets all over again. “You mean you’re assigned to someone like Lennox Demetri and you didn’t Google that shit?”  
  
  “I… we… we promised we’d learn about each other from each other.”  
  
  “And so he told you about the hit?”  
  
  The hit?  
  
  My heartbeat quickened, the rapid rhythm chasing away the constricting snake. “No… I mean… we haven’t discussed.”  
  
  “Oh, there are fascinating theories. See the thing is, no one knows for sure. It was all very hush-hush.”  
  
  “I’m not sure…”  
  
  His countenance fell. “Okay, I won’t say any more, but if Mr. Sexy is overly worried about your safety, from what I gathered, he has reason.”  
  
  “I don’t know.”  
  
  He sucked his bottom lip between his teeth. “I can’t believe you’ve been with him for all this time and you don’t know.”  
  
  “Pat, you’re killing me. I want to know. I do. But it’s this thing we have. I mean, I wouldn’t want him Googling me.”  
  
  “Little cousin, you’re boring.”  
  
  “Hey!”  
  
  “I mean, sure, you’re all heiress and shit, but come on… I grew up with you. That house of horrors was real, but you survived. Millions of people have had childhoods not even as bad as yours and not come out nearly as unscathed.”  
  
  “Do I seem unscathed?”  
  
  “No,” he replied, “you seem battered and a little bruised.”  
  
  When his eyes went back to my wrists, I let out an exasperated sigh. “Not abuse, kink, and… well…” I felt the rush of crimson fill my cheeks. “…I like it. Now drop it.”  
  
  “My! We need more wine.”  
  
  “No. I need to go to bed.”  
  
  “Since this heart-to-heart is about to end, let me tell you what I’ve observed.”  
  
  My entire body relaxed as I emptied my glass and laid my head back on the top of the couch. “Fine. Hurry because I’m about to pass out.”  
  
  “Whatever Lennox Demetri did to upset you.” I heard his eyebrows wiggle. “And now that I know about some preferences, I’m less concerned and more intrigued. But I digress. Whatever he did to upset you hasn’t altered your feelings for him. You’ve defended him at every turn. I mean, I have heart-stopping information that may or may not be accurate and you’d rather abide by a promise than hear me out.  
  
  “Going back to him isn’t optional. He owns you for a year. The fact that he allowed you this temper tantrum shows me that he’s an all-right guy. He could’ve refused to allow you to leave.”  
  
  I opened my eyes and lifted my gaze. “And what, Pat, tie me to the bed?”  
  
  “Whoa,” he lifted his hand. “I’m still coming to terms with my little cousin and kink. I don’t want any more details.”  
  
  “You know what I mean.”  
  
  “Literally, no. Figuratively, yes.”  
  
  Before I could speak, he went on.  
  
  “Here’s one more observation. For some reason, Spence—Bryce holds a part of your heart. Maybe it’s because for a rich, spoiled princess, your childhood was pretty sucky and you associate him with the better-than-awful parts.”  
  
  I wanted to protest Patrick’s description of me as well as a few other parts of his statement, but he lifted his hand again.  
  
  “My point is that I was only one year ahead of Spence at the academy. You may not know this, but I threatened his ass when you two started dating.”  
  
  It was my turn for my eyes to open wide. “You did?”  
  
  “I did. He was jacking off his mouth about you, about things I wanted to believe weren’t true.”  
  
  My stoma  
ch turned. We never did anything. What the hell was he saying?  
  
  “I told him that you deserved respect and gave him a nice, long list of easy lays. I told him that if he ever hurt you, I’d hurt him.”  
  
  My face scrunched in disbelief. “You told him to screw other girls but not to hurt me? That doesn’t make sense.”  
  
  “It doesn’t now, but it did then. My mom told me about the charges pending in Evanston. I know Uncle Alton is throwing money at it left and right, but I wasn’t the only one who had a reputation at the academy. From what I heard, Spence liked it rougher than kink. I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised that he got carried away and beat the shit out of that girl.”  
  
  There were too many parts to his statement to dissect each one. “He had a reputation? Before he dated me?”  
  
  “While. Little cousin, all those girls were my cover. You were his.” He shook his head. “I’m not saying he’s gay. I’m saying his preferences don’t make for his Carmichael-Spencer reputation. If you ask me, from all you’ve said, that’s what he wants back. The thing is, I never thought of you as a spoiled princess, maybe because I saw the inside of your castle. Now him…” Patrick shrugged. “…I never understood it. Spence walked around Montague like the royal son, when in reality, he was nothing more than a pauper.”  
  
  “The Carmichaels—”  
  
  “Weren’t the Montagues. Hell, they weren’t even the Fitzgeralds.”  
  
  I shook my head.  
  
  “For some reason, Spence had, correction, has, entitlement perfected. If you ask me, you or I should be the ones entitled. Instead, we’re the ones signing our companionship away for a year at a time and he’s back in Savannah crying in his milk, wanting more.”  
  
  I stood and this time I took my wine glass to the kitchen and set it in the sink. When I returned to the living room, Pat was still sitting on the couch staring into space. I walked close and planted a kiss on his forehead.  
  
  “I love you. Thank you for always being there for me. Not just now, but always.”  
 He reached out and secured my hand. Turning it over he gently traced the faint bruise on my wrist. “You trust him.”  
  
  It wasn’t a question, but I nodded anyway.  
  
  “I don’t know what’s going on in that pretty head of yours, but trust is something that should be difficult to earn and way too easy to lose. Once it’s lost, regaining it is difficult. Spence may have earned it when he was three, but little cousin, if you knew all I do, you’d never put it in his grasp again.”  
  
  “But with the rumors about Lennox’s wife…” I almost stopped my question. “…you’d let him have it?”  
  
  Patrick shrugged. “It’s not mine to give. But from the look of your wrist, you’ve given it. Do you really want to take it away?”  
  
  Do I?  
  
  The boa was back.  
  
  “Good night, Pat.”  
  
  “MR. DEMETRI,” NIKKI, my newest secretary, said as she opened the door to my office. “Daryl Frazier is here to see you.”  
  
  I glanced at the clock on the corner of my desk. He was five minutes early—as far as I was concerned, a point in his favor.  
  
  “Show him in, and bring us both coffee.”  
  
  “Yes, sir.”  
  
  I didn’t listen as she asked Daryl the obligatory questions—cream? sugar? Life would be much easier if everyone drank coffee the way it was intended, black. What was the point if sugar and cream muted the strong, robust flavor?  
  
  “Mr. Demetri,” Daryl said as he entered my office, his hand extended.  
  
  “Oren,” I corrected as he took the seat across my wide desk. “As you can imagine, my schedule is quite busy. I’m glad my girl was able to squeeze you in, but to be honest, I don’t have much time.”  
  
  “Yes, sir, I’ll jump right to the point.”  
  
  The door once again opened. Nikki entered, her tight skirt accentuating her small waist, her high heels defining her shapely legs, but it was the neckline on the silk blouse that demanded Daryl’s and my attention. The large scoop fell low enough to showcase her most obvious assets, however, not too low to have them openly on display.  
  
  “Your coffee,” she said as she bent at the waist and sat two cups of steaming-hot brown liquid on my desk.  
  
  “Thank you, sweetheart,” I replied. “Hold my calls.”  
  
  “Yes, Mr. Demetri.”  
  
  “You were saying?” I encouraged Daryl, as I reclined slightly, rocking my large leather chair and moving my eyes away from Nikki’s assets.  
  
  “Yes, there’s this parcel of land, just south of Danbury.”  
  
  “Connecticut,” I confirmed.  
  
  “Yes, sir. It was just made available. As you’re probably aware, the population of this area has grown exponentially…”  
  
  Being on the receiving line of elevator pitches never got old. For years, ever since I worked to make a name, I was the one delivering the pitch, the one doing what needed to be done.  
  
  I wasn’t born to money but worked damn hard for it. Born to a longshoreman, I had a respectable example of hard work. I also saw firsthand who really made the money. It wasn’t my father or the other men who worked their asses off on the docks or out on the boats. It wasn’t their supervisors, because my father made it that far. It was the men who owned the docks.  
  
  It was the families that owned the city.  
  
  It was the ones who took risks.  
  
  My parents wanted me to accomplish something no other Demetri had done. They wanted me to get an education. They believed that would give me the ticket to move beyond the blue-collared world.  
  
  I did, but it didn’t.  
  
  Oh, it helped. It opened doors, but the real doors required more than a piece of paper or letters after my name.  
  
  I worked hard—night shift on the docks doing the same job my father had done, while I took classes during the day. I not only learned about business, I saw it. I watched who was paid to keep everything running smoothly, heard stories of unlikely alliances, and knew the truth about the unions.  
  
  I’d heard my whole life how they took their piece of my father’s paycheck. He never complained because, according to him, the union and its representatives were why he made good money—why a man with an eighth-grade education could support a family. They were also why he had health insurance and a retirement plan. He willingly paid his dues, and they took care of him. It was the way it was done.  
  
  There were men and women in my classes at New York University who came from money, those with the proverbial silver spoon. I never conceded to their birthright. Most of them had no idea where I came from or that I worked all night to sit in the same class as them. The more I got to know them, the more I recognized that half of them would be eaten alive in a place like the docks of Brooklyn or New York City.  
  
  Business was not learned only in books.  
  
  I did what my parents—God rest their souls—wanted and completed my degree. In the long run, it did for me what working the docks did—it gave me connections. I knew not only the men and the families I needed to know but also up-and-coming people in the world of business. Some things had been too good for too long. I heard the rumors of change. With my fingers dipped in both pies, I was prepared to move with it.  
  
  When I first graduated from NYU, I played the game. I worked for the man. I applied for legitimate jobs in big glass buildings. I wore the best suit I could afford and perfected my pitch. I knew the recession was hitting everyone hard, but I refused to give up. I knew the sacrifices that my parents had made for me and refused to squander them.  
  
  I made my name known working my way through the ranks.  
  
  It was there in the glass buildings with the fancy views that I learned that it was the same game. Everyone played it. Just like the dockworkers, everyone paid. It didn’t take me long to change my goal. I didn’t long to be someone else’s best employee. No. To truly succeed, I needed to be the one who received the payouts.  
  
  I determined that Oren Demetri would be on the receiving end, not the one paying out.  
  
  I renewed alliances. My friends had friends who had family. We knew who deserved their cut and who didn’t but got it anyway. It wasn’t the same as my education at NYU; however, it was just as valuable.  
  
  The economy improved. Energy was no longer in short supply and business was once again booming. And then the FBI began its stings. Feds began questioning and taping and building cases that didn’t need to be built.  
  
  The well-oiled machines that had controlled the docks, the construction industry—from the materials to the workers—and the city since the early 1900’s began to falter. The commission was still strong, but not what it had been. Just last December, Castellano—Big Paulie—was murdered on the streets of Manhattan, and the rumblings stirred something inside me—a drive.  
  
  My father didn’t have the same option. Not only because he didn’t have a degree, but because his timing was wrong, and his dedication was to my mother and me. That’s not to say I didn’t care about my family. I’ve always adored Angelina. She’s been the love of my life since I heard her laugh in sophomore English.  
  
  I still remember her sitting with three other girls looking at a magazine. If I closed my eyes, I could see her—brown hair, big blue eyes, dressed in jeans and a Metallica t-shirt. She was about as far from the type of girl I usually noticed as possible.  
  
  My preference had always been women like Nikki, those who dolled themselves up, knew their assets, and didn’t mind flaunting them. That wasn’t Angelina. It was as if she didn’t realize how fucking beautiful she was or the way her laughter brought sunlight to the classroom, even to a tired schmuck who’d worked all night, gone home to shower, and dragged himself to class.  
  
  It took me time, years, to finally make my move. I had a name to build. A beautiful intelligent woman like Angelina Costello deserved better than the son of a dockworker. Besides, her family had connections. Her family was connections. I knew the name and valued my life. It wasn’t until the name Oren Demetri had clout that I could pursue a woman like her.  
  
  As Daryl Frazier opened the canister of blueprint  
s and laid the large sheets of paper over my desk, I smirked at how far I’d come. No longer was I the one searching out investors. People were coming to me. I’d taken those lessons and in this new climate, turned them into a reputable business. Demetri Enterprises. It sounded official.  
  
  The families taught me something that NYU only confirmed. Never put all your eggs in one basket. That’s what my father and all the men like him had done. They’d worked hard, given everything they had, for one thing—a paycheck. People who received paychecks never got rich. It was the ones who wrote the checks who made the real money.  
  
  “And you can see how this subdivision will fill a need not met in the city. These lots are half an acre each. The clearance requires twelve feet on each side of every structure. As you can imagine, people who’ve lived in the city will pay big money for that much space. It’ll be like a mile to them.”  
  
  “Do you have the prospective on utilities?”  
  
  “Yes,” he said, as he dug in his briefcase for another folder.  
  
  OUR BROWNSTONE IN Windsor Terrace wasn’t as grand as I wanted, but Angelina never complained. My goal was to move my family—my wife and one-year-old son, Lennox—from Brooklyn one day. It would take time. Currently, the money coming in was mostly going back out. It was the way it worked and I knew it.  
  
  I looked at my watch as I parked my car. It was later than I’d promised to return home. I’d told Angelina I’d be home for dinner. I’d planned to be. After the meeting with Frazier, I had multiple more. I was on my way to call it a night, when I got the call.  
  
  I’d been invited to Carlisle’s, an out-of-the-way little restaurant and bar in Little Italy. The invitation meant two things: my growing success was getting noticed and—since no one refused an invitation—I was going. The meeting went well. I had faith it would. Angelina’s cousin Vinnie had been the one to invite me. Family took care of family.  
  
  From the porch I saw the faint glow of a lamp in the living room. Quietly, I opened the front door. On the sofa, covered in a blanket, was my wife. Her long hair was mussed as some of it was bound in a low ponytail and some was free with bits over her beautiful face.  
  
  I stood mesmerized for a moment or two, unsure if I should wake her or allow her to sleep. On the end table near her head was a small white box with a thick, golden-colored antennae. It was the newest baby monitor, the one she’d wanted. With it, she could hear Lennox from anywhere in the house even though he was upstairs in the nursery.  
  
  I’d always told her not to wait up for me.  
  
  Since our son was born, she needed sleep. He was a demanding little guy who now, at nearly a year, was finally sleeping through the night. Every now and then, he’d wake just to see if he could get a response.  
  
  Angelina turned, her bedroom eyes slowly opening. “You’re home?” Her raspy voice sent shivers down my spine. Even now, it was like her laughter from college. It was my sunshine.  
  
  “I’m sorry about dinner.”  
  
  She shook her head as she sat up, the blanket falling and her large t-shirt-type nightgown falling from her bare shoulder. It made me smile. If I’d been asked when I was younger, I would have said my wife would wear silk negligees, not oversized cotton shirts.  
  
  “I got your message,” she said. “There are leftovers in the refrigerator if you’re hungry. I can warm it up.” She shrugged. “I made lasagna.”  
  
  I sat beside her and reached for her hand. “Damn, I love your lasagna. Baby, Vinnie called. I couldn’t say no.”  
  
  “Did it go… okay?”  
  
  I leaned forward and covered her lips with mine. She was so damn beautiful.  
  
  As the temperature of the room increased, Angelina pulled slightly away while a smile graced her lips. “I’m going to take that as a yes.”  
  
  “Yes, it went very well. I have a few investment opportunities, and it seems as though the backing is there.”  
  
  Her smile faded as her hand fidgeted in mine. “Oren, things are going well. I love our home. I miss you. If you take that money you know they’ll expect more.”  
  
  “Yes, baby, and so will I. I’m not keeping the money, I’m paying it forward. The interest I’ll collect will more than cover what I’ll owe. I was looking at plans today for a new neighborhood just south of Danbury. The houses will be spaced apart with yards. Just imagine a real yard for Lennox. “We could have a swing set and a patio.”  
  
  “We have a yard,” she said.  
  
  We didn’t. We had a postage stamp of grass out our back door. That hardly made a yard.  
  
  “These houses will be on half an acre. I was thinking that I might commission two lots. That would be a whole acre. That’s more land than we’ve ever owned.”  
  
  She stood. “I’m going to check on Lennox. Are you sure you’re not hungry?”  
  
  I stood and pulled her close. “Not for food.”  
  
  Angelina playfully shook her head. “Well then, you’d better plan on eating lasagna for breakfast for the next few days.”  
  
  The corners of my lips moved upward. “The breakfast of champions.”  
  
  AFTER TOSSING AND turning for most of the night, I woke early and decided that more sleep was not in my immediate future. The cold sheets were my stark reminder that I was alone. In only a short time, I’d grown accustomed to waking beside Nox, basking in the warmth radiating from his hard body. Closing my eyes, I imagined the way I’d often find his muscular arm draped protectively over my waist as our bodies spooned, fitting together as one. As night turned to morning, even in his sleep his erection would probe my back, the best alarm clock I’d ever had.  
  
  Sighing in the dark of Patrick’s spare room, I concentrated on what had happened to that fairytale. I thought about what I knew or what I thought I knew. I replayed the scene from the night before a hundred times. As I did, I realized that I hadn’t asked Nox if he’d killed his wife. I’d asked him to tell me that he wasn’t responsible for her death.  
  
  What would a man like Nox deem as responsible? What did Pat mean about a hit? What kind of case and testimony did Jocelyn’s family have against Nox? Why hadn’t it already been pursued if her death occurred years ago?  
  
  More questions swirled.  
  
  I recalled weeks ago that Deloris told me Demetri Enterprises was an umbrella, one with some nefarious subsidiaries. Well, she hadn’t used that word, but now with Bryce’s note, it seemed accurate. Nox had said that Demetri Enterprises was an investor in Infidelity. Was that what Bryce meant by prostitution?  
  
  Still lying upon the bed, my shoulders straightened indignantly, my bare feet sliding upon the soft sheets as I wondered how Bryce would feel if he learned that for only a brief time, I’d been an employee of Infidelity. If Pat were right that Bryce needed me for a cover, maybe I wouldn’t be his best choice.  
  
  I also wondered if Patrick had considered Millie Ashmore, my high school best friend, an easy lay? Was she on the list he’d supplied? The idea of her, the girl claiming to be my friend, sleeping with not only my boyfriend but also my cousin made me physically ill.  
  
  I threw back the blankets. The train of thought I was riding had taken a downward spiral. It was time to disembark before it crashed. Willing myself forward, I decided to get my day going. Despite all hell breaking loose around me, I had class this morning, followed by a discussion session. From everything I’d gathered, the discussion was invaluable.  
  
  Thirty-five minutes later, showered and dressed for class, I was contemplating my breakfast and raiding the refrigerator of fruit when Pat entered, all debonair and dressed for work. His spicy cologne reached me even before his footsteps stopped.  
  
  Turning his direction, like a thief with my hand caught in the cookie jar, I smiled. “You really do clean up well!” As he made his best GQ-worthy pose, I giggled and asked, “How are things at Kassee?”  
  
  “Going really well. Are you finding everything you want?”  
  
  “Yes,” I replied as I laid the food on the counter. “You did say make yourself at home.”  
  
  “I did,” he confirmed. “I don’t know if you remember, but on t  
he day of your… interview, I had a presentation at Kassee that I couldn’t miss?”  
  
  Though that wasn’t high on my radar that day, I did remember.  
  
  “I do. Did it go well?”  
  
  His brown eyes sparkled as he took a piece of my pineapple. “It went so well, later, one of the partners talked to me about employment after my internship is complete.”  
  
  “Pat, that’s fantastic. What does Cy think?”  
  
  “Hmm?”  
  
  I squinted my eyes his direction. “Why are you humming at me?”  
  
  “Because as much as you’re fighting it, you’re thinking like one of a couple. If you weren’t, you’d have said, that’s fantastic. What are you going to do?”  
  
  I shrugged as I hit the button on the coffee machine. It hissed and sputtered filling the kitchen with the delectable aroma of a French roast brew as I recalled my lonely wake-up. “I miss him. I woke up this morning and rolled toward him.”  
  
  Pat’s fingers laced through mine. “Honey, I bet he feels the same. Call him. Do it now, or you’ll never be able to concentrate on those boring professors.”  
  
  I squeezed his hand and then released mine. “Thanks for the advice, but as I said, I left the ball in his court.”  
  
  “You know, you can’t—”  
  
  I interrupted, almost telling him I could, but settled for saying, “I know.”  
  
  Pat glanced at the clock on the microwave. “I didn’t think you went to class this early.”  
  
  It wasn’t even seven. Since I was up, leaving early was part of my rebellion against surveillance strategy. “I don’t, but since I’m up I thought I’d head to campus and get a little reading done in the library before class.”  
  
  “You can stay here. I’m heading out. It’ll be quiet.”  
  
  I shrugged. “I know. Thanks, but I need to move.”  
  
  Patrick kissed my forehead. “Sure thing. You move. Have you called that bodyguard guy to drive you?”  
  
  I stood taller, holding my cup of coffee in both hands and gently blew across the steaming molten java. Looking at my cousin through my lashes I replied, “Nope.”",1,1757529635.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

**The Remembered:** Elias Meier, Governor of Earth 

**Date:** July 13, 2136

Politics, the ultimate game of chess that never ends. A game played by fools and adult children who think they are intellectual. Or by people who would genuinely love nothing more than to see the solar system collapse in on itself. 

It's a tricky thing, yet I have managed to stay in the loop for decades now. Today isn't any different, the *Opulent* is in full swing today. Hundreds of Planetary leaders and directors yelling and arguing left and right. It's like trying to deal with an oversized classroom of toddlers. 

The Solar system has been a mess ever since the Pilgrim discovered alien life. To be frank we sort of already anticipated something like this to eventually happen. But it was still a massive shock all the same. 

When the news first got out everyone was eccentric, some for drastically different reasons than others. But still very boisterous in nature. But as quickly as the excitement came, it was quickly replaced by dread after the actual details of our neighbors came into view. 

“An entire *Federation*!, myriads of murderous herbivores that wouldn't think twice to eradicate us where we stand! For the simple fact of having a different dietary need than them!” I have never seen the director of Neptune being so vocal before, he and his governing body are usually the quietest in the Opulent. On that note his remarks, though correct, are not helping my case for a diplomatic resolution. 

This meeting's goal on paper should have been much simpler then what it has turned into. The solar system is deciding what to do in regards to the aliens found not far from our system. The overall agreement *was* to exhaust every form of diplomacy possible. Unfortunately no one can agree with anything outside of the rocky planets. We have been here for 2 hours so far, unable to come to an agreement, and now calls for military action are on the table. Or at the very least, aggressive military build up. 

Despite the chaos, I have seen much worse. If the Jovian incident is anything to go off of, all I would have to do is convince the most influential people here and everyone else should follow through. The major issue is that the most influential (outside the rocky planets) are the ones shouting the most for military action.   

“OUR Solar system is not a place that can be meddled with by alien threats. Up until this point we have been doing perfectly fine on our own! These aliens are nothing but bad news in every way, something that has already been proven by the data from the Pilgrim. I can not stress enough the need for a double- no TRIPLED military budget act to bolster our defense!” The Jovian Director once again shouts. 

The planetary director of Ganymede seemed more than pleased with this idea “I whole heartedly concur, we have enough problems as is in our own solar system. We should not have to worry about a multitude of ANIMALS attacking our homes!”

The Governor of Mars on the other hand doesn't seem to be pleased by this. “Now hang on fellas, be gentlemen like here. Are we really going to show hostility towards a force far larger than our own? That would not only be signing our own death waivers but most importantly the death of our entire species as we know it!”

There we go, someone who actually got some sense. “I agree with you Governor, we need to be careful with this. There is no telling what could happen if we were open with military build up. If these aliens really do view us as “Predators” then being openly hostile would only prove their fears. We need to show some tact here.” 

The Directors seemed to at least visually agree with the hard facts. Good, I don't know what I would do if those two went and convinced everyone to be aggressive. The Governor of Venus comes in to back us up.

“Further data received from the Pilgrim tells of a massive political body encompassing over 300 species. Even if this body isn't unified in the slightest it can prove to be extremely difficult to manage. We are heavily out gunned and manned in any scenario. Any outright show of aggression this early on would not end well for us, we are not even mobilized for border conflicts right now.” 

The entire meeting room of the Opulent murmurs in agreement and discourse, I was just about to bring that up too, I am glad my fellow rocky planet Governors have my back here. On that note, he is 100% correct, we are heavily outnumbered. It's not like our technology puts us too far ahead either,  evaluating their technology. I can confidently say that both sides have similar technological capabilities. Though they have much more sophisticated heavy weaponry and ship defense. While we eclipse them in computing technology, AI and literally every other civilian and production based technology for whatever reason. In other words we could hold a good defense when mobilized but we would be grinded down by sheer numbers, and they basically have an infinite amount of ships and soldiers compared to us. The only way we would be able to pull out even a slight victory is by use of AGI swarm fleets and maybe cyber attacks. To make the situation worse, I can only go off of information we were able to siphon off, this doesn't include anything we don't know yet. 

The President of Titan opened up this time around, he sounded very concerned, he usually maintains quite the poker face, I can't blame him for faltering today. 

“I understand what you all are saying about the need to be cautious here and the need for diplomacy, but what about the current situation? Our explorers are trapped planet side due to some sort of skirmish that began. We have already established that whatever governing bodies that exist out there are not friendly with each other and already very unstable, in fact we have witnessed an active attack happen between these warring factions. How can we be certain that we won't just get attacked anyway? They seem to have no issue attacking their fellow prey species.” 

… I wish I knew exactly what to do here. We can't be certain whether or not they will just attack us. In fact it would be naive of me to assume that something like that couldn't just happen seeing that some of these species are unpredictable. But I think I have a good way to address at least some of the worries. 

“It would be proper to compromise then. I propose a new directive, we begin mobilization of the military, not in a way to bring light to ourselves, it would be of the utmost importance to keep our mobilization a secret from the greater galactic view, this isn't authorization to do anything that could antagonize or in any way make us appear aggressive. Diplomacy comes first and must be of the utmost importance.” 

Attempting the gauge the meeting halls overall feel is very difficult now. Many seem very indecisive now. But honestly what more can we do? We can't even get our explorers back through intervention right now. We can't be too certain how our new neighbors will act.

“Meier, assuming we follow through, and assuming diplomacy is actually a deterrence for attacks, how would we deal with the aliens after establishing ourselves on the galactic stage?” 

The IO cabinet member poses a good question I must admit. Though I would assume total neutrality for the time being is our best shot.

“It would be in our best interest to stay out of whatever is happening in the wider galaxy. We will benefit where we can. But we should try to establish ourselves first before doing anything regarding that.” 

Things are starting to quiet down now. I guess everyone finally has just about the same idea as me here. 

“Our system will accept this proposal, only if the rocky planets agree to release more technology that have been purposely kept from the other systems up until now. There is no reason to be keeping secrets from the rest of this union.”  … it's always the governess of Europa, always wanting to find a way to profit off of any situation. If I allow more military technology to be revealed to the wider solar system it will make our intervention efforts in the Jovian system to help the people in our own union much harder, and she knows it! … these corporations have no bounds … but I can't say no now, not at such an important moment. 

“The Rockies will pledge to release the technology *needed* in the coming years, your right it is in our best interest to all be up to date especially in such trying times. After all we need to protect our people first … isn't that right *governess*?” The Governess stares at me with those ugly cybernetic eyes of hers, she can't play me, I have been here too long. I know every trick in the book. I said I would really like some technology, I didn’t say all this should be good enough.  

“If your end of the compromise is upheld then the Jovian system will follow suit.” She finally finished up, good that's all I needed to hear

Looking around this meeting hall it seems like I have the approval of the majority planetary leaders and system directors. Good. There isn't usually much unilateral agreement in this hall, it just makes my job far less stressful. I can't imagine what would happen if a more aggressive policy was passed.

After some discourse the voting begins. Usually this process would have taken months but this is a very crucial moment so doing this as quickly as possible is our best shot.

2730 votes later and what felt like forever, A majority of 2638 out of 2730 agreed to this more peaceful solution. The AGI system displays the votes to the hall and begins sending out messages for the planets to follow

I'm getting too old for this … hell I need a coffee right about now. Maybe a vacation … but then again I'll be damned if I leave Jones or Zhao to run things even for a day, those lunatics would probably blow up half an alien planet if I let them.  

After a short intermission the assembly convened once again to discuss further issues 

“If all has been said then I officially declare this Emergency summit adjourned!”. Despite everything, this was surprisingly one of the easiest meetings I have had in my entire career. The house doesn't usually come to such a unilateral agreement like this. Good that just makes this process go by much faster and far smoother. 

It took some time for the hall to disperse, there was a lot of chatter among politicians, I wasn't really feeling it so I retired early. Taking my personalized exit from the hall and eventually making my way to my designated living quarters. I quickly reached the massive window set to oversee the asteroid belt. Honestly even in my old age I very much enjoy space and its sights, so much to explore and see, so little time in comparison. Not to mention this massive station, truly a wonder of engineering. A large station with rings extending out far. Titan really outdid itself with the design. 

Unfortunately my little “break” is cut short, I received a communications request from . . . E.D.C. Even after such a tedious meeting . . . Alright, fine let's see here.

When the transmission goes through, I am met with a display of Jones on my projector. She didn't have her usual smug expression on her face though, it must be serious. 

“What is it General?” 

“Ah! You actually picked up quickly this time, well that's good we are having a little issue over here. Intelligence has detected a single ship near the solar system. It seems to be some sort of stealth ship with alien properties.” 

What? Interesting, whoever this is must have thought our radar wouldn't pick up a single ship. We'll welcome human space. 

“Well, have we already intercepted the ship? Is it a Federation ship? What's the status?”

“Well for starters, we haven't intercepted the ship. I only received this transmission a few minutes after the voting ended but the defense council already sent a collector and a small fleet with it to go deal with the issue. On the topic of the origins of this ship, going off the data from the Pilgrim it doesn't seem to be a Federation ship. At least from the ship models that were available in the file.” 

“Alright, I want this ship captured alive, the ship and the pilot needs to be in one piece. I can not stress enough how much I want you to keep this vessel in one piece unless you have absolutely no other choice.” 

She's giving me that disappointed look. Just because I said she couldn't simply authorize the immediate execution of an unknown vessel. She isn't even trying to hide her craziness anymore. She then drinks out of her cat coffee mug while squinting at me… she's doing that to annoy me, I just know she is. 

“Alright Governor, I'll make sure the fleet keeps in line.” 

… Wait … “Why didn't the EDC call me about this? Why are you the only one online right now?” 

“North American systems picked it up first, I am simply letting you know first the EDC is already being informed now as we speak.” 

“Alright then, just keep this on the low. With this new alien scare I can't imagine what the planetary leaders would do.”

She simply nods and cuts the feed, man, I need a drink.

This is vanilla SDV. No tricks, no cheats, just normal gameplay.

I eventually made five runs including my first visit. I only spent a few days preparing in between runs, so this is easily doable while achieving other goals. I never reset days for better runs, this was my first try for each run. I will say getting two auto-petters was a little lucky, but I usually get at least one per run when I start going hard. I was going to add commentary to the runs, but I got lazy. You can use the following links to see how a mediocre gamer (me) can quickly get to the point that they are consistently hitting floor 400+.

Before I get started with preparation I want to give two tips that should make your runs better.

One - bombs are cheap. You can build them for four iron ore and one coal. Players wait to only use bombs when they get enormous returns. You shouldn't do that. Even if you're only bombing rocks to find a staircase, you're buying yourself a few extra seconds which are very valuable.

That brings me to two - opportunity cost. Opportunity cost is an economics concept that when you spend time on something there is a hidden cost which is what else could you be doing with that time. And if your time is more valuable elsewhere, you should be doing that thing. You may see some iron or gold in Skull Cavern and think it's free, but mining them takes time away from the end of your run and the time at the end of your run when you're at your deepest is the most valuable.

Moving on to preparation, the first thing we want to do is get Foraging 6, build lightning rods, and pray to the RNG gods for lots of stormy days in Summer. The problem with this step is that you can't just actively do it, time needs to pass. Just get battery packs when you can. Quick PSA - you can only have your lightning rods stuck by lightning while you're in game. So if you get a stormy day, be sure to stay up until 1:50 or 2:00am. Do not go to bed early.

On to things we can control, farming for the Burglar's Ring. The Burglar's Ring is, in my opinion, the best item in the game. The fastest way to farm it which is to bounce between floors 65, 55, and 45, and then reset by going to floor zero either through the elevator or by leaving from a different floor. Your second ring should probably be the glowstone because it's really cheap and you'll upgrade that to an iridium band later.

Next is bombs. For bombs we want iron and coal and there's no better floor to farm for both than floor 41. You should be able to make a minimum of 60 bombs but probably more by farming this floor for a day. You could also use it to farm dust sprites for the Burglar's Ring, it's just a bit slower but you get iron.

Lastly, you want salads. Not cheese - salads. It doesn't matter how you get the money for them, just buy them from Gus in the saloon any day of the week. I live in Wisconsin so this is hard for me to reiterate, but I'll say it again - salads, not cheese.

I do want to make another quick side-note here about bombs and daily luck. The base chance for a rock to have a staircase ranges from 0% at the worst possible daily luck to 4% at the best. It is then increased by the inverse of the number of rocks left. If you are in a large are with hundreds of rocks and you blow up a large patch with a bomb on a very bad luck day, you have almost no chance to find a staircase. Meanwhile if it's a very good luck day, you'll have a very good chance. Because of this, we'll be waiting for daily luck of at least good humor before investing bombs.

So now we're ready for your first run into Skull Cavern. I'm using a bone sword, but any late mines weapon is fine. I did, during my first run, find a steel falchion which was a major upgrade from the bone sword. At this point in the game I believe I'm at level seven or eight Combat. I like to build two staircases from stone as sort of a 'get out of jail free' card in case you hit an early infested level or that cursed spiral level. Your first run is gonna have three goals:

One, get at least six omni geodes. You'll be using these at the end of your day to buy Warp Totem: Deserts.

Two, kill a few rock crabs for crab cakes. With the Burglar's Ring you'll likely get one or two from each rock crab and the speed buff lasts the entire day when eaten in the morning.

And three, try and get at least 25 iridium ore so that we can upgrade your pickaxe.

After your first run we're back to preparation for your second run. We're going to upgrade your pickaxe and top off your bombs and salads. It's also a good idea, if you have battery packs, to spend some time farming gold ore in Mines level 81.

Check the daily luck every day. About 40% of the time the day will be at least good humor lucky. As soon as you find one of these and you have no other obligation for that day, pop a crab cake and use your warp totem: desert. Do not waste time petting your animals, skipping them for one day won't matter and losing that time at the end of your run is terrible.

Your goal for your second run is simple - get as low as you can as fast as possible and find a prismatic shard. You should only really start farming when you see multiple iridium nodes within bomb proximity of one another. In my second run which I have linked I made it to floor 132 and farmed 319 iridium ore which netted me two prismatic shards. Given that I likely broke about 100 iridium nodes and each had a 3.5% chance to drop a prismatic shard, the chances I would have ended up with no prismatic shards is around 2.8%. It's unlikely, but it does happen. In the case you don't get a prismatic shard, keep repeating this step until you do.

I also try to break as many crates and barrels as I can. You'll get a good chance to get a lucky ring. I didn't, but at least I tried.

Now that we are starting to get iridium, we'll be able to start our crystalarium farm if you also have battery packs. You'll likely need to spend extra time farming gold since it requires 5:2 gold to iridium. For every crystalarium you make, add a jade. We're now creating an infinite number of free staircases, all it takes is time.

Regardless of whether or not you make crystalariums, you'll now be able to get the galaxy sword. I'll now do the following preparation in my spare time:

One, top my bombs and salads off if needed.

Two, upgrade my house for the kitchen if you haven't already done it. This allows me to buy coffee and the Triple Shot Espresso recipe from Gus and then make Triple Shot Espresso.

Three, farm Combat nine to be able to craft an Iridium Band and ten to get an additional multiplicative +15% damage buff from the Combat 10 talent.

To target farm Combat I simply reset the top floor of Skull Cavern over and over and kill all of the large purple slimes and their spawn. This method could get you level ten combat in just a few days and that damage talent is worth it.

I personally decided to randomly go to Skull Cavern at like 10am one day just to do a casual run and get some more iridium. At this point even your late start casual runs should be able to get past level 50.

Now we just need to trade all of our jades to the Desert Trader on a Sunday and we're ready to go for our next run. As soon as we get a decent luck day with no other obligations, we head in. We should have a small pile of staircases now which make for exponential returns.

We want to use staircases early on in order to effectively start our run on a lower level where the loot can be very good. We'll use staircases later on to reroll bad floors or when our bombs never found an exit.

The goal of this run is to get as much Iridium and as many Prismatic Shards as possible.

After our run we'll want to start trading three prismatic shards to the Desert Trader every Thursday for Magic Rock Candy until we don't want anymore.

As for preparation, we'll want at least one prismatic rock candy, at least two hundred staircases, and at least 200 bombs. If we keep making crystalariums this is simple.

The goal of your next and my final run in the guide has multiple parts. If you have one or two lucky rings from crates or barrels, bring them. You'll want to wait for at least a good humor day to go, but a very happy daily luck day is better.

Firstly, we're going to pop a crab cake and espresso just to save a few seconds getting to the entrance. We then staircase down to level nine or ten and replace our crab cake with our magic rock candy. We also replace one or two of our rings with lucky rings if possible. We now go treasure room hunting. Every floor will have about a 6.2%-7% chance with no rings to be replaced with a treasure room. Each ring adds an additional 1%.

Our goal now is to staircase down as fast as possible stopping to grab as many treasures as we can. I believe in my run I didn't stop to collect any iridium until after level 200. I did the math once and if you make it to level 238 with a magic rock candy active and no other luck buffs you will have a 50% chance to find at least one auto-petter. It's way easier later in the game though.

Once our Magic Rock Candy runs out, we'll switch back to Crab Cakes and we now farm like crazy.

The result was a very drinkable but kind of watery/weak brew that was good to drink straight or over ice.

  
Recently got a new batch of beans that I brewed in the fridge for \~16 hours (was aiming for 14, I overslept lol) at a 1:9 ratio. The result was super acidic and bold but not really drinkable unless I diluted with water at a 1:1 / 1:0.5 ratio of coffee to water which also made it pretty weak tasting but definitely caffeinated.

I want to know how I can make a good, bold, flavorful brew with my beans. Ready to drink or concentrates are both fine. I'm using a 44 oz container with a filter for\~60 oz so water displacement is a little bit of an issue. Any ideal ratios? Should I brew on the counter? Timing? Any advice would help.",2,1757529017.0,coldbrew,2,1.0,False
1ndmbnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1ndmbnu/delve_into_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_breville/,Delve Into the Best Drip Coffee Maker Breville Precision Brewer Worth It,"I’ve been using the Breville BDC400BSS Precision Brewer for some time now, and as someone who lives on coffee (and considers it a vital life force), this drip coffee machine has been an interesting addition to my kitchen. I picked it up after going down a seemingly endless rabbit hole of coffee brewer reviews, and to be honest, it’s been a fascinating ride navigating all its features and trying to figure out if it was the right fit for my caffeine addiction. Dive in with me as I share my thoughts on it!

**Sleek Design That Fits the Countertop Battle**  
The first thing that caught my eye about this coffee maker was its brushed stainless steel exterior. It’s got that polished, high-end look that blends beautifully with a modern kitchen without screaming for attention. The dimensions (6.7""D x 12.4""W x 15.7""H) mean it isn’t outrageously large, so I didn’t have to clear out half my countertop to make room for it. While it might not win any awards for being ultra-compact, it’s sturdy and well-built, which is comforting when you’re dropping money on an appliance. That glass carafe also gives it a bit of an elegant touch, easy to grab and pour without dripping everywhere (trust me, I checked).  

**Performance Worth Your Morning’s Time**  
This machine isn’t just a pretty face. With six automated brewing modes—Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and a fully customizable My Brew mode—you’re spoiled for choice. My mornings have been far less boring because I’ve rotated through all the options just to test how far it can go. The Gold mode consistently meets SCA standards for temperature and brewing time, which, if you’re a coffee nerd, is something you’ll definitely appreciate. My Brew lets you tinker with bloom time, water temperature, and flow rate, which is fantastic if you enjoy experimenting with different beans. From floral light roasts to darker, chocolatey options, the brew quality feels more nuanced for every style.  

[Check Breville BDC400BSS price on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)

**Advanced Features for the Coffee Enthusiast**  
I tested the precision temperature control feature with a thermometer (because yes, caffeine dedication takes you to weird places), and it was spot on. It adjusts between 197-204°F to match the coffee’s optimal flavor release. The auto steep-and-release technology is a game-changer for smaller brews as it prevents the water from rushing through too quickly when the carafe isn’t in place. The dual filter baskets—flat bottom and cone—make it crazy versatile, letting you customize the flavor extraction process. Not to mention, it's pour-over adapter compatible, which I had to try with my Hario V60 for fun. While I wouldn’t say it replaces a manual pour-over, it comes surprisingly close for an automated setup.

**Highlights**  
- Intuitive brewing modes that suit diverse coffee preferences  
- SCA-accredited Gold Cup mode for expert-level brewing  
- Precise temperature settings for ideal flavor extraction  
- Comes with thoughtful accessories like cleaning brushes and filters  
- Sleek, brushed stainless steel finish adds durability and elegance  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The learning curve for customization might overwhelm casual users  
- Coffee output could feel slightly under-extracted if not perfectly dialed in  
- The reusable filter basket might retain more oils than paper filters, which some might dislike  

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this to other coffee makers like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Bonavita BV1900TS, the Breville certainly wins with its feature-packed options, especially the customizable My Brew mode. The Moccamaster, while exceptionally reliable, is more rigid in its functionality and limiting for those seeking diversity in brewing. The Bonavita, on the other hand, leans slightly toward simplicity and affordability but lacks the high-tech flair this machine brings. For pour-over coffee enthusiasts, the Breville’s adapter compatibility edges out some competitors by catering to manual brewing preferences too.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Let’s talk about what really matters here—does it justify its price tag? For its range of brewing options, precise controls, and high-quality finish, I genuinely think this coffee maker falls under smart spending. Sure, it costs more than your average brewer, but the flexibility and advanced brewing options make it a long-term investment for coffee lovers aiming to elevate their home setup. It’s not the choice for someone just looking to brew a quick, standard cup, but if you’re experimenting with beans or flavor profiles, it’s a keeper.

I work in restaurants. The flow of people coming out of the kitchen with heavy, hot plates, fresh hot coffee, or stacks of glass and silverware (including steak knives), is constant. 

People drop things all the time- liquid which makes the floor slippery, and glass! As much as we try to sweep it all up, there is inevitably a shard or two of glass that doesn’t get found until the deep clean that night. 

I BEG and plead with the public: do not let your small (or even older but rowdy) kids EVER run in a restaurant, or go barefoot. I know we want them to explore and see how things work. But the restaurant is, for the love of God, NOT the place to do it. It is dangerous for our kids and for the staff.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.

* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.

Curious to know how people  usually get their coffee:

1. Do you get your beans ground at local coffee shops, or do you grind them yourself at home?

2. If you have a grinder, do you prefer buying beans from local spots around town, or do you go with the bigger box store options?

I've been getting really into home decorating lately, and I wanted to share my thoughts on fall scented candles. They've completely transformed my living space, and I think you might love them too.

I recently discovered some amazing fall scented candles (you can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles) that have made my home feel so much more cozy and welcoming. The warm, spicy aromas of pumpkin spice, cinnamon apple, and vanilla bourbon just hit differently during autumn.

What I love most about these seasonal fragrances is how they can instantly change the mood of any room. You know that feeling when you walk into a space and immediately feel relaxed? That's what these candles do. They're not just decorative pieces; they're mood setters.

I've noticed that placing these autumn-inspired candles strategically around my house creates different atmospheres in each room. In my living room, I keep a large three-wick pumpkin spice candle on the coffee table - it's become quite the conversation starter when friends come over. The kitchen gets a warm apple cider scent, which pairs perfectly with my baking adventures.

The best part? These seasonal candles aren't just about the fragrance. They come in beautiful containers that complement fall décor perfectly. Those amber-colored glass jars and rustic wooden wicks add such a nice touch to my shelves and side tables.

For anyone interested in trying them out, I found a great selection here: https://athometouch.com/fall-scented-candles. The prices are reasonable, and they last much longer than I expected.

Some tips I've learned along the way:
- Trim the wick before each use for a cleaner burn
- Keep them away from drafts to prevent uneven burning
- Place them near other fall decorations for a cohesive look
- Layer different fall scents in separate rooms
- Use them during dinner parties for extra ambiance

I've also noticed these candles help mask cooking odors while making my space feel more inviting. Plus, they're perfect for those cozy nights when you're curled up with a book and a warm blanket.

Something else worth mentioning is how well they work for creating a seasonal transition in your home. As the weather gets cooler, these warming scents really help embrace the autumn vibes. They're like little pieces of fall that you can spread throughout your house.

All day long, we always had tea on the table, kept warm by a candle. It wasn’t really a tradition, but it became part of our daily life. In the mornings, we had mocha — the typical ground coffee in a tin pot, briefly heated and served right away.

During big family dinners, though, my grandmother would serve a type of coffee we called *bitter coffee (very strong and really dark in color)*. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to learn the recipe. The only thing I remember is that she said this coffee had to be cooked for a very long time.

A mum that I know regularly leaves her baby alone. Baby is currently just turned 1 but this has been going on since he was 4/5 months as far as I’m aware.

Baby will be left asleep in the car while the mum goes into a cafe for coffee. Car is parked on the road approx 200 yards away and completely out of sight.

She also leaves baby in the car while she goes into the supermarket etc.

Yesterday she popped round to our house and I assumed she’d left baby with her husband. After nearly an hour my husband went to leave and she asked him to check on baby who she’d left in the car. Husband checked and baby was hysterical, bright red and had clearly been screaming for a long time. She was completely unbothered by this.

She has also been on a camping holiday with her family and put her baby in a travel cot in a pup tent separate to the rest of the family, although pitched right next to their tent.

I have said something in the past along the lines of ‘are you really leaving him in the car’ and ‘don’t you want to bring him with us’ etc and she just brushes it off.

I don’t know whether to just butt out and leave her to it but it feels so wrong when she does it. I’ve started to distance myself from her as I’m just not comfortable with it.

Walking Dates Club Pilot 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️,"I’ve seen so many posts on this sub where people are tired of online dating, ghosting, and low-effort conversations. The swiping format rewards the bare minimum, and attracts people who just want dopamine hits, not real connection.

Here’s what I’m putting together: Walking Dates in Jaipur.
Instead of endless texting or awkward one-on-one setups, we meet in person, walk in a safe scenic spot (Central Park, Jawahar Circle, etc.), and rotate walking partners every 15–20 minutes. Walking side by side makes conversation flow more naturally, and you actually get to see if there’s real-world chemistry.

And honestly, this isn’t just about dating. After college, it becomes surprisingly hard to make new friends. Work takes over, social circles shrink, and unless you’re glued to apps (which get tiring), there aren’t many natural ways to meet like-minded people. This is a chance to change that — whether you leave with a new friend, a spark of chemistry, or just a fun evening outdoors.

Small group (12–15 people max), gender-balanced (men/women), respectful and safe environment. I’ll bring conversation starter cards to keep it fun and easy. The point is simple: come make friends, and maybe find love, but only serious people, no low-effort nonsense.

How the evening will go (2–2.5 hrs):

Check-in (15 min): Name tags + quick intro circle (fun prompts like “Your comfort food in Jaipur?”). Quetions where simple one word answer would suffice so that introverts are comfortable, dont wanna recreate school trauma for people. 

First Walk (20 min): Random pairs + conversation starter cards.

Rotations (2–3 rounds, 20 min each): Swap partners with gentle cues, optional mini-tasks.

Group Break (15–20 min): Tea/snack stop at a local café or chai stall → relaxed group mingling.

Closing Circle (15 min): Everyone shares one fun thing they learned about someone. Optional “contact cards” drop for those who want to stay in touch (low-key match system).

👉 If you’re interested, DM me with:

Name

Age

Gender

Occupation (optional, just to balance group mix)

What you’re looking for (dating / friendship / open to both)

🎟️ Tickets will just cover snacks + organizing (₹500–₹800 range). You’ll pay beforehand, like booking a movie ticket, it’s for your own good, so you don’t flake last minute.

The pilot event will only happen if enough people show interest, so if this sounds like your thing, DM me and let’s make it happen. Jaipur deserves better than just Tinder swipes.

I’d also love to hear suggestions from fellow redditors:
-What’s the best spot for a safe and fun walk in Jaipur?
-Do you think 12–15 mins per rotation is better, or keep it at 20?
-Any local chai/coffee spots you think would be perfect for the group break?

To keep things safe and comfortable for everyone, we’ll be vetting people before confirming spots (basic checks based on the info you send). The event will also be managed by both female and male organizers, so that girls feel at ease knowing it’s not just a bunch of random guys running the show. Respectful behavior is a strict requirement, anyone making others uncomfortable will be asked to leave and won’t be invited again.",5,1757528353.0,jaipur,18,0.78,False

I bought a limited pistachio color Vertuo pop+ and I feel like I’m going insane. I’m actually at my limit with customer service. It’s been awful. I had no idea that nespresso was so stingy and so shit at replacing machines.

The first machine, upon the first plug in, sounded like a chainsaw, was super loud, wouldn’t take any water, and shook violently. I thought it was just a one off thing because after troubleshooting the water issue it actually did work. It made coffee. Sometimes it would shake and be loud, sometimes it was fine. But after about a month it would only shake and be excessively loud. It would literally shake so bad and so aggressively that it would knock mugs and stuff off of my coffee bar. At that point I gave up trying to fix it and called customer service. They refused to send a new machine because of course, on call with them, the machine was fine and a reset “fixed it”. But after like 30 minutes it started shaking again. We got it on video and that was the only reason they replaced the first machine.

The second machine got here last week and it will not take water. Nothing has fixed it. Nothing has worked. It will run a full rinse cycle, but that’s it. I can’t descale it, I can’t use a pod to make coffee and the straw method for the air bubble did nothing. I get that stupid red light anytime I do anything other than a rinse cycle. I have no idea why it will only run water on a rinse cycle. I haven’t been able to make any coffee for a month now because two machines have been sent to me and not tested. 

They’re sending a third one, but only after my sister cried on the customer service video troubleshooting thing because we’re so frustrated. They almost sent us sent us nothing because the pistachio color was limited time only and they didn’t have any machines left. After an hour they found one, so it’s coming (I’m not hopeful), but they won’t give me a refund at all. All I can do is pick from a REGULAR pink or purple Vertuo pop machine if this one doesn’t work. I won’t even get a refund on the difference I paid for a limited color. What the fuck is going on???",0,1757528200.0,nespresso,0,0.33,False
1ndlyjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1ndlyjc/explore_bayfree_lip_stain_set_can_it_really_last/,Explore Bayfree Lip Stain Set Can It Really Last All Day Without Smudging,"Lip stains have always intrigued me, but finding one that ticks all the boxes—long-lasting, lightweight, and versatile—felt like hunting for a unicorn. The ""bayfree B0DQTFG99C"" lip tint stain recently came across my radar, and after some daily wear, I’ve got plenty of thoughts to share. If you’re someone who splits their time between coffee meetings and gym sessions, this product promises to be a game-changer. However, like with everything, there are a few trade-offs tied to its charm.

**Feels Like Barely Anything On Your Lips**
One of the product’s key selling points is its lightweight formula. As someone who despises the sticky, overly heavy feel some lip products carry, I was thrilled by how weightless this one feels. After applying a thin layer of the stain, I almost forgot it was there until I checked myself in the mirror hours later. This feature makes it perfect if, like me, you prefer a natural look rather than feeling like you’ve caked on layers of makeup.

**Waterproof Power That Withstands the Day**
Testing out its waterproof claim, I wore this through a full day that included sipping coffee, eating a greasy burger, and surviving an unexpected rainstorm. Surprisingly, the lip stain stayed in place without smudging. It didn't vanish or make me rush for a touch-up every hour, which resets the standard for all my future makeup purchases. Sure, there's a subtle fade over time, but nothing alarming.

**Looking For a Pop of Multifunctionality? It Delivers**
One factor that made me fall for this product is the versatility. It’s not just a lip stain. You can dab it on your cheeks for a matching blush that blends effortlessly into your skin. I experimented by applying it lightly over my foundation, and the result was a nice, rosy flush. Plus, its non-greasy texture meant there was no weird blotchiness as the hours passed.

**Vibrant Pigments, Yet Still Natural**
This isn't one of those lip tints that screams, ""Look at my lips!"" Instead, it offers a sophisticated splash of color that enhances your natural look. I tried every shade in the set, ranging from subtle pink to bold coral, and was impressed by how seamlessly the colors suit different occasions. Whether you’re dressing up or keeping it casual, there’s likely a shade for your vibe. It’s hydrating, too, so no mid-day discomfort or chapped-lips situations.

**Favorable Aspects**
This product has quite a few excellent features worth mentioning:

- Transfer-proof and smudge-free, as promised, thanks to its fast film-forming formula.
- Compact packaging makes it easy to pop into your purse for on-the-go use.
- Non-drying formula enriched with nourishing ingredients leaves your lips comfortable.

**Negatives**
Even great products come with a few catches, and this one isn’t an exception:

- The applicator took a bit of getting used to; precision application might require some practice.
- While it is long-lasting, removing it entirely requires a little more effort than expected. A dedicated waterproof makeup remover is a must.
- The scent is faintly sweet but might not appeal to everyone.

**Other Options**
In a market flooded with lip stains, bayfree’s offering has its competitors. Take Peripera’s Ink The Velvet, for example, another Korean-style lip product claiming similar long-lasting wear and high pigment pay-off. Compared to Peripera, the bayfree stain feels slightly more moisturizing, though Peripera’s wider shade range could sway some. On the other hand, the Benefit Benetint cheek and lip stain provides a comparable dual-use formula, but I found bayfree’s color payoff far superior for cheeks. In terms of price-to-quality, bayfree performs well against both alternatives.

**Bang for the Buck**
Although pricing varies, this lip tint-stain combo feels like it packs value into one tiny tube. Other brands might provide either pigmentation or longevity, but scoring a product that performs well in both areas ensures you get your money’s worth. Plus, the inclusion of multiple shades makes it accessible for all occasions without needing to buy individual products. If you’re someone who values functionality and durability over fads, this product seems like a solid investment.

Peter wanted to give a better future to us, his children. I was not even 16 when we moved. It was painful, leaving the rest of my family behind, and friends, and comfort to go somewhere with a different language, culture and way of life.

It took me less than 2 years to get use it here. I felt growing, learning and adjusting tobtheir way of life, without forgetting where I come from.

The first years and a half, I went to a special school to learn the language, with other kinds from different countries and different ages. 

When I went to a normal school, it was different as they talked faster and with a dialect than the first school I went to. I was studying for hours, mostly at night. For hours, because I had to translate almost everything and learn them in their language. Mostly at night, cuz I had to clean the house, make food and then I was allowed to study. My parents were still expecting to have really good points, and somehow I did. Most of my points were above 70%. Except some classes that was difficult for me, like languages (exept english), and history. 

I was 3 years older than the rest of my classmates, because I lost years cuz of the language. I managed to make a really good friend then (we are still friends). We were everyday together, at school and at our houses, so much that my parents called him ""our adopted child"". It was fun cuz he really felt part of the family, and I past of his. 

After a couple of years, he came out to me as bisexual (later as gay) (let's call him Louis to make it easier). When he told I was freaking out a whole day. I learned from Peter that any other kind than man and woman, and men only go with women, was a sin. Was something upnormal, something bad. I was afraid Peter would do something to Louis, so I told him to keep it a secret from my family. When Peter found out, Louis wasn't allowed to come anymore, and I wasn't allowed to talk with him. Peter didn't want him home so my brother doesn't become gay 🙄. I was still friends with him, even after he had to change schools for classes he was interested in. 
Louis' mother was like a mother to me. When she died unexpected I was devastated. I wanted to help Louis, he was alone but I couldn't do anything. I wanted to bring him at our house to stay a bit and support him, but he wasn't allowed. I was shouting at Peter that because of him I can't help my best friend!
There were other people that could help him at this moment, and I felt so bad and angry not to be able to do anything. 

When Louis changed schools, I was alone there. I'm not the most social person. Though a classmate, I met Shay [fake name]. I was so alone that I said yes to be a couple with him. We were for 9 months together before I broke it up. 

Shay was my first. My first for a real relationship and first in having sex with. He wasn't that good of a person, but I don't regret being with him, because this way I saw what Peter really is. 
Peter was always really strict. I wasn't normally allowed to have a boyfriend, so I kept it a secret from him. Keep in mind, at that time I was 19 years old and 3 years in this country. Shay would alot of times say things about Peter, like he manipulates me, that I've grown and I'm allowed to do things, as going out for a drink, to the cinema, have sleepovers, go to a concert (wasn't allowed to to any of that stuff). He would say that I have to think of myself too, not clean up after him, ... that I was practically a house wide without the sex part. 

Those things got me thinking and I was going crazy and confused. I started talking to a council at school and she was shocked of the things I said. Things that I thought were normal, in fact weren't. She asked me multiple time if I want her to send a expert at home to see the situation. I was freaking out, I wasn't expecting to be that bad that he can even get send away. With all that together, I started ignoring Peter and say no to him. Like when he called me from my room when I was studying, ro the kitchen to make him a coffee that was leterly 1 meter next to him. Like when he asked me to go buy groceries, I said no, that I had to study, he kept being on his laptop. That s all he did, wok, laptop, eat, sleep (and his work had nothing to do with computers, he was just gaming). I stopped even saying good morning or good night to him. When he saw that he can't ask anything anymore from me, he was asking those things from my brother and sister. They were still afraid of him, but not me, not anymore. 

The first time I had sex with Shay, my overal first time, was because I was angry at Peter. I had told Peter that I was going out with friends (out around 16h back by 22h, max 23h)(i was going to Shay). I was running late. He was shouting at me that I have to clean before I can go, even though he knew I had plans for a week now. I cleaned up really fast, Peter even congratulated me by saying that I never cleaned that fast before, and that I have to it like that always. I told him cuz I was late that I ll stay longer, he said that I had to come home earlier. When I got to Shay then, I was so angry that I let him have sex with me. The times before he was pushing me, but I said that I wasn't ready. 

Shay was pushing for alot of things the time we were together, when I said know, he manipulated me to feel guilty that I didn't do what a girlfriend was supposed to do.

I needed do an essay for school on a computer but I didn't have any, and the one Peter was on, he needed it for games after work. I didn't have time to go to the library after school, and the essay was too big for the hours that I could be in the library. Shay didn't mind if I used his. He wasn't comfortabel with me bringing it from his house to mine with the tram alone, so he came with me. He wanted to bring it till the door cuz he was afraid I'm gonna break it, he didnt come in. At the door of my house, he gave me a kiss before he went back to his house. And at this fucking time, Peter pulled in with the car. I felt a cold sweat all over my body. When I went upstairs in the house, Peter looked so angry. He was saying that I'm a whore who brings boys over and what will the neighbours think. He send me to my room without even letting me explain. He called my mother at work and told her about what happend and that I'm a whore. After a while I went back to him to axplain about the laptop. He said about library, I explained. He somehow also asked how long am I with him and if I had sex with him. I didn't answer, and that was an answer enough for him. He was laughing and breaking stuff, punching stuff. My mom kept calling and when he picked up, he called me a whole again. My mother didn't know about the sex, or the boyfriend from me. She said she knew to calm him down. The same evening that we were eating all together, Peter wasn't eating. He was still angry. I asked if he wanted me to go so he can eat, he said yes. I went to my room and my mom behind me. I told her that I want to leave, but she said she needs me here. 
In my culture, inviting u to the table to eat, is inviting u into the family. Sending away, is sending u away from the family.  

Once I had a nightmare that Peter raped me. I told that to Shay for support. After we broke up, he told the whole school that I was having sex with my stepfather. 


After 9 months, I broke it up with Shay cuz I saw so many characteristics of Peter on him, so I said hell no. Kinda ironic for him: pointing things about Peter that were bad, but doing them himself to me. 

Peter was not changing, but I was not afraid anymore and I was standing up for my brother, sister and mother. He was hitting my brother and sister, and I told him to stop or I will bring protective services here. He started doing it behind my back. I was there for my brother and sister, and I talked to them alot. Not badmouthing their father, but the situation that it s not how things are normally supposed to be. 

One of the many times that my mother and Peter were fighting, he tried to pin her down and force himself in her, till my mother screamed and got out of the house. She told me that this happend after a couple of years. But the day that this happend, she went out for a walk. She wasn't answering her phone and Peter got angrier and angrier. When she got home he yelled at her and went to hit her, but I came in between them. I was shouting and crying as I told him to never lift a hand on my family again. He got angrier and said he ll do whatever he wants, and he shoved me on a chair and I felt down. My brother and sister watching all that and they were frozen and crying. My mother trying to stop him from hitting me again. I stood up and told him that he can try, but he ll be the one going to away. 

I was more not talking to him. I had a summer job at the same building as him. The next day I told my boss that if he comes, tell him I'm busy, I don't want to talk of see him. There wasn't much work that day, so when Peter came in I was standing by the bar of the restaurant I was working. He came next to me and talked to me. I ignored him. He said ""what now you won't talk to me?"" And he was laughing.

SORRY LONG POST:

I’ve been noticing a mainly positive effect now that I’ve been taking adhd meds(concerta, 40mg) . My rsd has gone down a LOT, which is mostly good.. but I think it also makes me less afraid to speak my mind bc I’m not afraid of the person disliking my answer and then being upset with me for whatever reason. ..because of this i think it makes me more blunt/accidentally rude ?? Even bitchy sometimes? Like. Ok so: I’m 20,and my bf is 22, we’ve been together for around 2 years. My bf was talking to me about finances earlier today and how he doesn’t have a lot of money saved up as a buffer after I started talking about how much debt I’d be in after tuition. He told me this right AFTER he got us coffee on a little date. I immediately felt guilty, even though he offered to pay. (He’s in a worse spot than me financially, but im also a college student who’s paying their way thru college aswell) Anyways, I essentially told him he should stop offering to pay for dates so often(im fine w not going on dates that cost money, a hike will suffice, AND I am willing to pay too) and to stop going out and ordering fast food so much bc those things will eat away at his finances. I already know he spends money on video games pretty often, so it’s like, choose one or the other. Fast food/paying for dates or buying steam games until he’s got a solid amount in savings….and I think I annoyed him. In the past, unmedicated, I probably woudlve just told him I’m sorry he’s struggling, and that it wasn’t his fault. I’m not sure if my advice was the thing that upset him or my tone, but I immediately felt his energy change and I was like… ohhh shit. And I apologized immediately. Anyways, he dropped me off at class afterwards and now I’m just sitting and stewing on it. I already texting him a big apology and he said he wasnt mad or anything, but I still think I was rude. This blunt type of speaking has happened a few times, and I feel like such a bad person afterwards. It’s either I’m a chronic people pleaser to avoid hurting people’s feelings, or I’m a blunt asshole. IDK HOW TO COMBAT THIS. I thought meds were supposed to make me less impulsive.. so I didn’t know this would be an issue.
Anyone else have a similar experience??",1,1757528065.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False
