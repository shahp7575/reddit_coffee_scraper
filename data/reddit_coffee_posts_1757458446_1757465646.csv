The app provides real-time station availability, charging status, and remote control, making the entire charging process seamless and efficient. With this level of technology, EVgo isn‚Äôt just meeting the needs of today‚Äôs EV owners; they‚Äôre anticipating the future.

But speed and tech aren‚Äôt the only things that set EVgo apart. Their customer service is exceptional, offering 24/7 support and a growing network that‚Äôs expanding rapidly across major metropolitan areas and highways.

However, EVgo‚Äôs infrastructure is scaling rapidly, so this issue will soon be a thing of the past.

Where it felt like my heart pause then picks up with a big thud , extreme fatigue and irritability,  in different instances i would feel unsteady and as if i was on a boat , for some period of time i was wondering if i had pots because when i would get up from laying down my heart would beat very noticeably hard for 2 or 3 mintues . Mind you from 2020 too now i hard an extremely difficult time driving , i dont still know why but the sitting position was always the most uncomfortable for me too be in. And even still kinda sucks as i believe i am healing , but anyway it wasnt until finally this year in may i finally got the doctors too do some test on me , first was a hida scan wish showed low functioning gallbladder 28,% ejc , wish they removed ( not convinced that was necessary) but maybe might have been a future issue , also they did the endoscopy. Wich revealed erosive gastritis and a small hitial hernia , now they made these findings and kinda just sent me off saying yep you have this stuff  , never really gave me a care plan , besides just saying hey eat smart , well so ive done well with that but never realized until all this summer of continued suffering and not seeing much if any improvement how much CAFFEINE has been playing a part in all this for me ,  ive always loved my energy drinks , having 1 if not 2 a day , but even back in may when i had my gallbladder out i had a hunch they wernt helpin my irritable belly and went from the Celsius energy drinks too just 1 coffee a day , well nothing changed. So to start wrapping this up , i am 7 days caffine free and for the first time in 5 years i feel like the clydesdale has stepped off my stomach. And it seems like all the other bizarre symptoms are melting off with it. I never wanted too believe or imagine that the caffeine would have played such a massive role in my suffering and i had brought it up too doctors when i questioned it in the past years as well and they seemed too think it was a laughable idea , i believe i am on the path too healing too anybody else who feels stuck in the gastritis hell and is wondering if caffeine could be keeping you there and your diet is otherwise clean , IT MAY BE  , i am an otherwise healthy 33 yr old male who dosent use alcohol or drugs , actually comming up on 3 years sober : ) id love too hear id anyone else has a similar story any thoughts or needs any words of encouragement,  this topic carrys alot of weight for me because i literally felt like a prisoner in my own body for 5 years and felt like i was falling everyone around me ",1,1757465397.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False

1nd0anj,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1nd0anj/scami_alert/,S-C-A-M-I alert,"
You may have heard of ""Scamanda,"" but I have a local grifter who gives her a run for her money. This individual has been running a complex con, manipulating people's empathy for financial gain while living a lifestyle that completely contradicts her stated struggles.

She consistently pleads poverty, claiming she can't afford groceries or bills, yet her Instagram tells a different story: daily coffee runs, professional photoshoots, facials, and fresh hair and nails. Her primary income seems to be from subpar digital artwork, sold to sympathetic followers under the false pretense of keeping her afloat.

The most egregious part of her scam, however, is the fraudulent medical claims. She allegedly lied about having cancer, stating she miraculously went into remission after just three chemo treatments‚Äîa medical improbability that exposes the entire charade. She claims to have no support system, dismissing the very people offering her sound advice from their own life experiences as ""not understanding"" her. She even vilifies her homeless parents while apparently having the means to help them.

The pattern doesn't stop there. Her stories are consistently crafted to make her a victim while omitting crucial details:

¬∑ She claimed to be raped but provided only a fragment of the story, painting a man as ""creepy"" while leaving out her own role in the situation.
¬∑ She reported her car stolen but admitted to leaving her keys, purse, and all valuables inside it, then attacked anyone who questioned that decision as ""disrespectful.""

When she was finally called out on her inconsistencies and lies, her response was to deactivate her dog's Instagram account and play the victim yet again, claiming she has ""no real friends,"" despite abandoning the very community that supported her from the beginning.

This isn't about struggling with medical issues. This is about getting caught. You got caught in your grift, your con, your scam. So you‚Äôre running away to find new people to manipulate.

A word of warning: your lies have a lifespan. The photography community is tight-knit, and your false accusations of sexual assault will catch up to you, resulting in you being blacklisted entirely.

1nd09ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1nd09ge/how_do_anyone_here_feel_about_reincarnation_then/,How do anyone here feel about reincarnation & then another the new age movement?,"I‚Äôm curious to know because I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about reincarnation lately. I won‚Äôt go into my personal practices, but just know that I don‚Äôt engage in conspiracy theories, extreme ‚Äúlove and light,‚Äù or extreme hate or anger. I approach life with discipline, authenticity, and grounded tranquility. I don‚Äôt ignore my emotions. I feel them all, but I don‚Äôt stay attached to negativity. I see certain situations as life lessons and opportunities for growth, not as ‚Äúcurses‚Äù or ‚Äúbad luck.‚Äù

I ask this because earlier this year, in the spring of 2025, I stumbled upon a local ‚Äúmetaphysical‚Äù store. It was run by a married couple, and the place was packed with all kinds of New Age and occult paraphernalia, candles, incense, magic-themed decor, and even a coffee shop. I was surprised because I had only gone in to buy incense. I loved the smell of one particular type, nothing more.

The store seemed popular. People came in and out, did puzzles, played something called DND, and attended events where ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù people gave talks on meditation and other New Age topics. The owner seemed to take a liking to me. I‚Äôm kind, but also self-preserved, observant, mindful, and intuitive, with clear boundaries.

Over time, I started noticing that many of these people were not truly healed within. Much of what was happening there seemed superficial. Tarot readings, full moon rituals, magic spells, misleading information, and a constant search for God through external means. Around my birthday, I even sensed negative energy coming from the owners and some people in their circle.

Eventually, I discovered that the owner practiced what I would consider fake magick, had a family history with dark magick, and her husband performed shamanic rituals. On the surface, they seemed loving and community-oriented, but I realized that spirituality can become a mask for ego and unhealed pain. Stepping away from that scene was liberating. I never engaged in any dark practices, but I could see how easily people can be misled into all sorts of nonsense under the guise of spirituality.

I realized that my own practices are centered on the Creator, grounded, and safe. I don‚Äôt align with crystals, Wicca, magick, dark or white, or external objects meant to distract from true inner work. Healing childhood wounds and past traumas requires introspection, not reliance on superficial spiritual gimmicks.

I also think it‚Äôs worth noting how the modern generation has corrupted New Thought principles with New Age practices like tarot, astrology, and superficial magic. The original principles, like the Law of Belief and the Law of Mind, are often misunderstood or misrepresented. The Law of Belief states that what you truly accept as real shapes your subconscious, which produces corresponding results in your life. The Law of Mind refers to how your entire mind, conscious and subconscious, creates your experiences, turning thoughts and beliefs into reality. The Law of Attraction is a modern interpretation that emphasizes that your focus and feelings draw similar experiences to you, highlighting the idea that like attracts like. In contrast, wishful thinking occurs when someone hopes for something without genuine belief, consistent focus, or openness to opportunities. The subconscious is not convinced, so results rarely manifest. In essence, belief fuels the mind‚Äôs creative power, focused thoughts guide it, and consistent action and openness allow your desires to flow into reality. Many New Age trends twist these teachings into rituals, spells, or external objects, which can mislead people away from true inner work.

This brings me to reincarnation. I‚Äôve seen people make the most outrageous claims about past lives, ancestral connections, or supernatural experiences. A lot of it is exaggerated or misleading. I wonder if there are truly reliable books on reincarnation that don‚Äôt veer into aliens, New Age myths, or unverifiable claims. People who have drifted from organized religion or are simply curious should be mindful of what they engage with. Many communities aren‚Äôt grounded in reality, and their teachings can distract from the core truth that we are co-creators with the Creator. True spiritual work requires deep inner healing, not chasing feel-good illusions or delusions.

I‚Äôd love to hear how others view reincarnation and the New Age movement in general, especially when it comes to separating genuine spiritual principles from the trends and hype.",1,1757465103.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False

[Buying Advice Needed](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/?f=flair_name%3A%22Buying%20Advice%20Needed%22)

Live in U.S. and had a breville express for about 7 years the grinder seems to be getting dull and extraction keep getting quicker even as im dialing finer i'm at 1 on the setting at the burrs have beeen cleaned and reset twice. The shots or getting thinner but still pleasant for milk drinks. Hands down I have that the grind and tamp dialed in better then any drink I can get out with unless just the right barista is working at the best shop I know of. I could trouble shoot and replace burrs but its had a good life and I feel its time to move on. I just dont know what moving on means for me.

At first I was just going to get a silvia or pro x and call it a day as that was my original thought when I bought the breville ""if this dies I'll get that cute pink pro X I saw on Morgan Eckroth counter years ago."" I was just like, oh thats cute everyone say they are great and last forever if I see one I can afford I'd buy that, went about my day. I didnt know about start up times preinfusion dual boiler single boiler pid pressure outside of you want 9 bars, or all the e61 valve stuff. I was just brewing starbuck espresso roast and syrups off ebay. Now that I'm looking to upgrade I'm a little paralyzed in what to get or what I even need. I mainly make 1-3 drinks a day mostly lattes and caps. I nowdo straight espresso now and then since that I ventured into medium light roast and stop using syrups. Rarely make for guest but on some holidays or dinner I pump out 3-4 for breakfast and after dinner.

Some things that are Important to me in somewhat order

Makes a great espresso and latte/capps consistently

Reliability I dont want to spend alot of money and have to make repairs a year or 2 and when I say I dont want to have to make repairs I mean none no gaskets or taking the thing apart or changing springs screw etc. every review of lamarazzo state built well while mention at least 2-4 repairs they had to do within the first 2 years some needed a tech to come but most were simple or easy to them I'm not in a position to fix or left things easily. At that price point thats a none starter for me. So I want it to work and last with minimal chance of failure or leaks. And if it breaks easily return or find a local tech to fix easily.

Start up time I would like it to be ready fairly quickly or atleast have a way to set it to prestart if the machine takes more then 15-20 minutes to warm up and steam. I dont want to wake up turn on take shower clean kitchen get a mcmuffin then its ready make coffee.

Thats about it. Now on to some brands models Ive been looking at. Also not even sure if my budget or what I'm looking at is overkill for my needs if so please let me know. I'm not a serious hobbyist or looking to make cold brews nitro or enter competitions I just want great drinks and dont mind putting in a little work to get them.

have three brands in mind

Rancilio pro x, Pid control soft infusion well tested, timer quick start up. Most blind taste test the rancillio pro x came out on top even if it wasnt the machine that won the shoot out the shots always seemed top notch. I can get it in pinK LOL down sides expensive for what it does but not sure if I want it to do more. no local support

Lelit elisbeth mera or bianco do I want to go down the manual Valve pressure E-61 machine the start up times seem long and not sure if they have timers to autostart. The mera and Bianca are beautiful machines. Could be fun to play with or utterly frustrating that's my worry also since in us the price from what I here is not as great as it would be if over seas. So value may not be as great as a lot of the reviews were making me think. I can get them at local stores sur la table and William Sonoma so easy to return. While some knock the build quality I have seen no complaints about them actually breaking down

Profitec seems well built not as much of a markup as lelit and rancilio if I was going to go single boiler a GO or the gaggia would be high on the list as they seem to have more options and cheaper then the Silvia. But I'm more looking at the 500 thru 700 series and we are back into the do I want to go the e61 game with flow control and manual everything instead of setting the pressure temp and time out the shot. Also start up time and shipping it. Heard something about a coating issue but not sure what it was about I know the trays have been upgraded to be bpa free dont know if thats what they where talking about.

Well hope this wasnt too long. I just dont know where to go If I'm going over board or what to do here. Im getting older so this well more then likely be my last upgrade/endgame. I know I need a good grinder and was looking at the Df64 or something along those lines.

I'm looking to have a wedding $10k or under. My partner wants a larger wedding but realistically we probably won't be able to afford that (he's wanting 200+ guests which is crazy expensive, I'm wanting like... 50?? Maybe not even? I don't think he realizes how expensive more guests are lol)

I've always wanted a wedding where both reception and ceremony are indoors (but may have an option to step outside for a breath of fresh air for anyone, like a patio or something) due to my allergies and distain for bugs/heat.

I've always wanted a princess dress; tight on the waist and very poofy for the bottom portion, with maybe some arm poofs and flowers along the dress. At the least, nothing bodycon all the way down, def want at least *some* poof.

I'm down to decorate as much as possible on our own/with the help of friends and family. And I'm definitely down for fake flowers instead of real ones. Basically, I'm okay with as much fake/hand made/cheap decor as possible lol

I DO however always have envisioned a venue with lots of bright, natural light and white as the base color of the walls, tables, chairs, etc. with touches of our wedding color. I love a cottagecore/fairycore touch in decor too! Partner is down for this vibe.

We are also okay with a very small, 2 tier wedding cake - the weddings I've been to, I've noticed almost no one touches the cake. Partner *does* want a cookie table though! Us and our family will be hand baking and icing those though.

I personally don't care for alch but my partner will def want a bar. Probs not an open bar tho due to costs. We both would love to pay for a coffee truck/booth at our wedding tho, we are avid coffee enthusiasts!

*I do want a full glam look with my makeup and hair.*

No code might have started as a rallying call for those allergic to Python, but it‚Äôs now a full-fledged revolution. Spreadsheets to super-apps, drag-and-drop to full-on workflows‚Äîwhat was once reserved for developers is now a playground for, well‚Ä¶ pretty much anyone!

Let‚Äôs be real for a minute:

- Who actually enjoys spending hours on repetitive, cut-and-paste data chores?
- Who hasn‚Äôt dreamed about linking up all those random apps that refuse to talk to each other?
- Who else got a little giddy the first time their Google Form zapped a Slack alert‚Äîwithout a single line of code?

‚ú® NO CODE AUTOMATION fixes all of these, and more. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs honestly SO EXCITING:

- Automated workflows mean more TIME. No more lunch hours lost chasing duplicate emails.
- Creative power shifts into your hands‚Äîif you can imagine the workflow, odds are you can automate it.
- You don‚Äôt have to wait for IT/someone else to ‚Äúbuild a tool for that.‚Äù You ARE the builder now!
- Scaling up becomes easier, because robots don‚Äôt need coffee breaks. (Or PTO.)

What excites me the most? It‚Äôs not just about convenience‚Äîthe way I see it, no code automation is quietly democratizing creation.

Suddenly, the office manager automating onboarding is just as much of a tech innovator as the software dev next door. The small business owner designing custom CRMs with drag-and-drop ease? YES. That‚Äôs power to the people.

And let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîwatching rows and columns fill up, alerts fire across chat apps, and sticky notes get replaced by slick dashboards is almost‚Ä¶ magical.

Curious where it‚Äôs going next? So am I. Imagine:

- AI-infused automation doing data clean-up, analysis, and even decision-making with minimal human input!
- More platforms opening up, so you can design wildly complex generative workflows without touching code.
- ‚ÄúOrdinary‚Äù folks becoming ‚Äúautomation-first‚Äù thinkers, changing productivity cultures everywhere.

So, fellow no code explorers‚Äîwhat‚Äôs YOUR proudest or wildest no code automation? Have you built something that changed your day-to-day life? Got a wishlist of automations you wish existed?

Let's keep pushing boundaries and share the joy. If you‚Äôve sparked a little productivity magic, drop your stories (and maybe even your failures‚Äîwe all have them! üòÖ) in the thread below!

FEMALE VOICE FIRST. Rosalinda opens the song. Thomas must NOT sing until his first tagged section.



\[Rosalinda:\]  

Mi amor, mi idiota,  

Te rogu√© quedarte con la soda.  

But you‚Äôre so stubborn some nights, mi papi  

So I'm taking you straight to bed  

Now you're coming home with me

REMINDER: Male voice begins here. Only Thomas sings this section.

\[Thomas:\]  

Not the idiota you think  

I just get carried away when I drink  

And I ain't stubborn, I just need coffee  

Maybe a churro to shake this off me  



\[Rosalinda & Thomas:\]  

Churro nights  

Let's get home before the night is gone  

Back to la casa 'fore the break of dawn

Holding the reins, I‚Äôll keep you on course

Love the way your coraz√≥n sets me free  

Cannot stand that I hurt you, bebita  

Sorry I'm borracho, beb√©

*‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me they didn‚Äôt steal‚Ä¶anything? Nothing at all?‚Äù*

The man‚Äôs bloodshot eyes had begun to glaze over. Flashing red and blue lights illuminated his face, cleaving through the thick darkness of my secluded front lawn.

Maybe I should have lied.

*‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶no. I mean, I haven‚Äôt exactly taken a full inventory of my stuff yet, but it doesn‚Äôt seem like anything is missing‚Ä¶‚Äù*

The cop cleared his throat, cutting me off. A loud, phlegm-steeped crackle emanated from the depths of his tree trunk sized throat. Without taking a breath, he smoothly transitioned the sputtering noise into a series of followup questions.

*‚ÄúLet me make sure I‚Äôm getting this right, buddy: you woke to the sound of burglars just‚Ä¶moving your furniture around? That‚Äôs it? I‚Äôm supposed to believe that a roving band of renegade interior decorators broke in to, what‚Ä¶open up the space a bit? Adjust the Feng Shui?*

He looked over his shoulder and gave his partner an impish grin. The other officer, an older man with rows of cigarette-stained teeth, responded to his impromptu standup routine with a raspy croak, which was either a chuckle or a wheeze. I assumed chuckle, but he wasn‚Äôt smiling, so it was hard to say for certain.

My chest began to fill with all-too familiar heat. I forced a smile, fists clenched tightly at my sides.

*Let‚Äôs try this one more time,*¬†I thought.

*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak to their intent, sir. And that‚Äôs not what I said. I didn't hear them move the furniture. I woke up to the sound of music playing downstairs. As I snuck over to the landing, I saw a flash, followed by a whirring noise. It startled me, so I stepped back, and the floorboards creaked.‚Äù*

The cop-turned-comic appeared to drop the act. His smile fell away, and he started to jot something down on his notepad as I recounted the experience. I was relieved to be taken seriously. The rising inferno in my chest cooled, but didn‚Äôt completely abate: it went from Mount Vesuvius moments before volcanic eruption to an overcooked microwave dinner, molten contents bubbling up against the plastic packaging.

*‚ÄúI guess they heard the creak, because the music abruptly stopped. Then multiple sets of feet shuffled through the living room. By the time I got to the bannister and looked over, though, they had vanished. That‚Äôs when I noticed all the furniture had been rearranged. I think they left through the back door, because I found it unlocked. Must have forgotten to secure the damn thing.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†he said, staring at the notepad, scratching his chin and mulling it over. After a few seconds, he lifted the notepad up to his partner, who responded with an affirmative nod.

*‚ÄúWhat do you think? Has this happened to anyone else closer to town?‚Äù*¬†I asked, impatient to learn what he‚Äôd written.

*‚ÄúOh, uh‚Ä¶no, probably not.‚Äù*¬†He snorted.¬†*‚ÄúI have an important question, though.‚Äù*

His impish grin returned. Even the older cop‚Äôs previously stoic lips couldn‚Äôt help but twist into a tiny smirk.

*‚ÄúWhat song was it?‚Äù*

Seething anger clawed at the back of my eyeballs.

*‚ÄúMy Dark Star by The London Suede,‚Äù*¬†I replied automatically.

*‚ÄúHuh, I don‚Äôt know that one,‚Äù*¬†said the younger cop, clearly holding back a bout of uproarious laughter.

In that moment, the worst part wasn‚Äôt actually the utter disinterest and dismissal. It was that, like the cop, I‚Äôd never listened to that song before last night. Didn‚Äôt know any other tracks by¬†*The London Suede*, either. So, for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt understand how those words spilled from my lips.

I‚Äôd google the track once they left. It¬†*was*¬†what I heard.

Anyway, the cop then presented his notepad, tapping his pen against the paper.

*‚ÄúThese were my guesses.‚Äù*

In scribbled ink, it read¬†*‚ÄúBad Romance, by Lady Gaga? The Macarena?‚Äù*

It took restraint not to slap the notepad out of his hand.

God, I wanted to, but it would have been counterproductive to add¬†*assaulting a lawman*¬†to my already long list of pending felonies. Criminality was how I landed myself out here in Podunk corn-country to begin with, nearly divorced and with a savings account emptier than church pews on December 26th.

So, I settled for screaming a few questions of my own at the younger of the two men.

For example: I inquired about the safety of this backcountry town‚Äôs tap water, speculating that high mercury levels must have irreparably damaged his brain as a child. Then, I asked if his wife had suffered a similar fate. I figured there were good odds that she also drank from the tap, given that she was likely his sister.

Those weren‚Äôt the¬†*exact*¬†words I yelled as those neanderthals trudged back to their cruiser.

But you get the idea.

\- - - - -

No matter how much bottom-shelf whiskey I drank, sleep would not come.

Once dawn broke, I gave up, rolled out of bed, and drunkly stumbled downstairs to heave my furniture to its previous location. I didn‚Äôt necessarily¬†*need*¬†to move it all: my plan was to only be in that two-story fixer-upper long enough to perform some renovations and make it marketable. In the meantime, I wasn‚Äôt expecting company, and it wasn‚Äôt like the intruders left my furnishings in an awkward pile at the center of the room. They shifted everything around, but it all remained usable.

I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of it, though. It was a reminder that I plain didn‚Äôt understand¬†*why*¬†anyone would break in to play music and move some furniture around.

So, with some proverbial gas in the tank (two stale bagels, a cup of black coffee, additional whiskey), I got back to work. The quicker I returned to renovating, the quicker I could sell this godforsaken property. I purchased it¬†*way*¬†below market-value, so I was poised to make a pretty penny off of it.

Blair would eat her words. She‚Äôd see that I could maintain our ‚Äústandard of living‚Äù, even without my lucrative corporate position and the even more lucrative insider trading. It wouldn‚Äôt be the same, but Thomas and her would be comfortable.

After all, I was a man. I¬†*am*¬†a man. I deserved a family.

More than that, I couldn‚Äôt endure the thought of being even more alone.

If that was even possible.

\- - - -

*How did they do all this without waking me up?*¬†I contemplated, struggling to haul my cheap leather sofa across the room, its legs audibly digging into walnut-hardwood flooring.

I dropped the sectional with a gasp as a sharp pain detonated in my low back. The sofa slammed against the floor, and the sound of that collision reverberated through the relatively empty house.

Silence dripped back incrementally, although the barbershop quartet of herniated vertebral discs stacked together in my lumbar spine continued to sing and howl.

*‚ÄúClose enough.‚Äù*¬†I said out loud, panting between the words. My heart pounded and my head throbbed. Sobriety was tightening its skeletal hand around my neck: I was overdue for a dose of spirits to ward off that looming specter.

I left the couch in the center of the cavernous room, positioned diagonally with its seats towards a massive gallery of windows present on the front of the house, rather than facing the TV. A coffee table and a loveseat ended up sequestered tightly into the corner opposite the stairs, next to the hallway that led to the back door. Honestly, the arrangement looked much more insane after I tried to fix it, because I stopped halfway through.

I figured I could make another attempt after a drink.

So, the sweet lure of ethanol drew my feet forward, and that‚Äôs when I noticed it. A small, unassuming square of plastic, peeking out from under the couch. I don‚Äôt know exactly where it came from; perhaps it was hidden under something initially, or maybe I dislodged it from a sofa crease as I moved it.

Honestly, I tried to walk past it with looking. But the combination of dread and curiosity is a potent mixture, powerful enough to even quiet my simmering alcohol withdrawal.

With one hand bracing the small of my aching back, the other picked it up and flipped it over.

It was a polaroid.

The sofa was centered in the frame, and it was the dead of night.

When I arrived two weeks ago, I had the movers place the sofa against the wall. That wasn‚Äôt where it was in the picture. I could tell because the moon was visible through the massive windows above the group of people sitting on it.

At least, I think it was a group of people. I mean, the silhouettes were undoubtedly people-shaped.

But I couldn‚Äôt see any of their details.

The picture wasn‚Äôt poorly taken or blurry. It was well lit, too: I could appreciate the subtle ridges in the furniture's wooden armrests, as well as a splotchy wine stain present on the upholstery.

The flash perfectly illuminated everything, except for them.

Their frames were just‚Ä¶dark and jagged, like they had been scratched out with a pencil from¬†*within*¬†the picture. It was hard to tell where one form ended and another began. They overlapped, their torsos and arms congealing with each other. Taken together, they looked like an oversized accordion compromised of many segmented, human-looking shadows.

Not only that, but there was something intensely unnerving about the proportions of the picture. The sofa appeared significantly larger. I counted the heads. I recounted them, because I didn‚Äôt believe the number I came up with.

*Thirty-four*.

My hands trembled. A bout of nausea growled in my stomach.

Then, out of nowhere, a violent, searing pain exploded over the tips of my fingers where they were making contact with the polaroid. It felt similar to a burn, but that wasn‚Äôt exactly it. More like the stinging sensation of putting an ungloved hand into a mound of snow.

The polaroid fell out of my grasp. As it drifted towards the floor, I heard something coming from the hallway that led to the house‚Äôs back door. A distant melody that I had only heard once before last night, and yet I knew it by heart.

*‚ÄúBut she will come from India with a love in her eyes*  
*That say, ‚ÄòOh, how my dark star will rise,‚Äô*  
*Oh, how my dark star, oh, how my dark star*  
*Oh, how my dark star will rise.‚Äù*

Terror left me frozen. I listened without moving an inch. By the time it ended, I was drenched with sweat, my skin coated in a layer of icy brine.

After a brief pause, the song just started over again.

My head became filled with visions. A group of teenagers right outside the backdoor, maybe the same ones who had broken in last night, playing the song and laughing under their breaths. Maybe the cop was there too, having been in on the entire scheme. Perhaps Blair hired them to harass me. The custody hearing was only weeks away. The more unstable I was, the more likely she‚Äôd get full custody of Thomas.

They were all out to prove I was a pathetic, wasted mess.

Of course, that was all paranoid nonsense, and none of that accounted for the polaroid.

I stomped around the couch, past the other furniture, down the narrow hallway, and wildly swung the door open.

\*‚Äú\****Who, THE FUCK, are‚Ä¶‚Äù***

My scream quickly collapsed. I stood on the edge of the first of three rickety steps that led into the backyard, scanning for the source of the song.

A few birds cawed and rustled in the pine trees that circled the house‚Äôs perimeter, no doubt startled by my tantrum. Otherwise, nature was still, and no one was there.

My fury dissipated. Logic found its way back to me.

Why was I expecting anyone to be there? The nearest house was a half-mile away. Blair wouldn‚Äôt hire anyone to torment me in such an astoundingly peculiar way, either. One, she wasn‚Äôt creative enough, and two, she wasn‚Äôt truly malicious. My former affluence was the foundation of our marriage. I knew that ahead of time. Once it was gone, of course she wanted out.

Before I could spiral into the black pits of self-loathing, a familiar hideaway, my ears perked.

The song was still playing. It sounded closer now.

But it wasn‚Äôt coming from outside the house like I‚Äôd thought.

\- - - - -

*Laundry room, bathroom, guest room. Laundry room, bathroom, guest room‚Ä¶*

No matter how much I racked my brain, nothing was coming to mind.

You see, there were three rooms that split off from the hallway that led to the backyard. From the perspective of the backdoor, the laundry room and the bathroom were on the left, and the guest room was on the right, directly across the laundry room.

*Maybe I‚Äôm just forgetting the layout. I haven‚Äôt been here that long, after all.*

I remembered there being three rooms, but I was looking at four doors, and the muffled sounds of *‚ÄùMy Dark Star‚Äù* were coming from the room I couldn‚Äôt remember.

My palm lingered on the doorknob. Despite multiple commands, my hand wouldn‚Äôt obey. I couldn‚Äôt overcome my fear. Eventually, though, I found a mantra that did the trick. Three little words that have bedeviled humanity since its inception: a universal fuel, having ignited the smallest of brutalities to the most pervasive, wide-reaching atrocities over our shared history.

*Be a man.*

*Be a man.*

***Be a man.***

My hand twisted, and I pushed the door open.

The room was tiny, no more than two hundred square feet by my estimation. Barren, too. There was nothing inside except flaking yellow wallpaper and the unmistakable odor of mold, damp and earthy.

But I could still hear¬†*My Dark Star*, clearer than ever before. The sound was rough and crackling, like it was being played from vinyl that was littered with innumerable scratches.

I tiptoed inside.

It was difficult to pinpoint¬†*precisely*¬†where the song was coming from. So, I put an ear to each wall and listened.

When I placed my head on the wall farthest from the door, I knew I was getting close. The tone was sharper. The lyrics were crisp and punctuated. I could practically feel the plaster vibrate along with the bass.

I stepped back to fully examine the wall, trying to and failing to comprehend the phenomena. There was barely any hollow space behind it. Not enough to fit a sound system or a record player, that's for certain. If I took a sledgehammer to the plaster, I would just create a hole looking out into the backyard.

I stared at the decaying wallpaper, dumbfounded. I dragged my eyes over the crumbling surface, again and again, but no epiphany came. All the while, the song kept looping.

On what must have been the twentieth re-examination, my gaze finally hooked into something new. There was a faint sliver of darkness that ran the length of the wall, from ceiling to floor, next to the corner of the room.

A crack of sorts.

I cautiously walked towards it. Every step closer seemed to make the crack expand. Once my eyes were nearly touching it, the crevice had stretched from the width of a sheet of paper to that of a shot glass.

Somehow, I wasn‚Äôt fearful. My time in that false room had a dream-like quality to it. Surreal to the point where it disarmed me. Like it all wasn‚Äôt real, so I could wake up at any moment, safe and sound.

The edges of the fissure rippled, vibrating like a plucked guitar string. Soon after, I felt light tapping on the top of my boots. I tilted my head down.

Essentially, the wall coughed up a dozen more polaroids. They settled harmlessly at my feet.

The ones that landed picture-up were nearly identical to one I discovered in the living room, with small exceptions. Less scratched-out people, a different couch, more stars visible through the windows in the background, to name a few examples. The overturned polaroids had dates written on them in red sharpie, the earliest of which being September of 1996.

When I shifted my head back to the crevice, it found it had expanded further. I stared into the black maw as¬†*My Dark Star*¬†faded out once again, and I could see something.

There were hundreds of polaroids wedged deeper within the wall, and the gap had grown nearly big enough for me to fit my head through.

Long-belated panic stampeded over my skin, each nerve buzzing with savage thunder.

I turned and bolted, flinging the door shut behind me.

Racing through the narrow hallway, I peered over my shoulder, concerned that I was being chased.

Nothing was in pursuit, but there had been a change.

Now, there were only three total doors:

Laundry room, bathroom, guest room.

\- - - - -

I have a hard time recalling the following handful of hours. It‚Äôs all a haze. I know I considered leaving. I remember sobbing. I very much remember drinking. I tried to call Blair, but when I heard Thomas‚Äôs voice pick up the line, I immediately hung up, mind-shatteringly embarrassed. I didn‚Äôt call the police, for obvious reasons.

The order in which that all happened remains a bit of a mystery to me, but, in the end, I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter.

Here‚Äôs the bottom line:

I drank enough to pass out.

When the stupor abated and my eyes lurched open, I found myself on a sofa, propped upright.

Not angled in the middle of the room where I had left mine, either.

This one had its back to the windows.

\- - - - -

The scene I awoke to was more perplexing than it was hellish.

The living room was absolutely saturated with objects I didn‚Äôt recognize - knickknacks, framed photos, watercolor paintings, ornamented mirrors. A citrusy aroma wafted through the air, floral but acidic. There were the sounds of lively chatter around me, but as I sat up and glanced around, I didn‚Äôt see anyone. Not a soul.

I was about to stand up, but I heard the click of a record player needle connecting with vinyl. The sharp noise somehow rooted me to the fabric.

*My Dark Star*¬†began playing in the background.

When I turned forward, there he was. Materialized from God knows where.

He appeared older than me by a decade or so, maybe in his late fifties. The man sported a cheap, ill-fitting blue checkered suit jacket with black chinos. His face held a warm smile and a pair of those New Year‚Äôs Eve novelty glasses, blue eyes peeking through the circles of the two number-nines in 1995.

The figure stared at me, lifted a finger to the corner of his mouth, and waited.

I knew what he wanted. Without thinking, I obliged.

I smiled too.

He nodded, brought a camera up to his eye, and snapped a polaroid.

The flash of light was blinding. For a few seconds, all I could see was white. Screams erupted around me, erasing the pleasant racket of a party. Then, I heard the roaring crackle of a fire.

Slowly, my whiteout faded. The clamor of death quieted in tandem. My surroundings returned to normal, too. No more knickknacks or family photos: just a vacant, depressing, unrenovated home.

The man was also gone, but something replaced him. Like the scratched-out people, it was human-shaped, but it had much more definition. A seven-foot tall, thickly-built stick figure looming motionless in front of me. If there was a person under there, I couldn‚Äôt tell. If it had skin, I couldn‚Äôt see it.

All I could appreciate were the polaroids.

Thousands of nearly identical images seemed to form its body. They jutted out of the entity at chaotic-looking angles: reptilian scales that had become progressively overcrowded, each one now fighting to maintain a tenuous connection to the flesh hidden somewhere underneath.

It didn‚Äôt have fingers. Instead, the plastic squares formed a kind of rudimentary claw. Two-thirds down the arms, its upper extremities bifurcated into a pair of saucer-shaped, plate-sized digits.

I watched as the right arm curved towards its belly. The motion was rigid and mechanical, and it was accompanied by the squeaking of plastic rubbing against plastic. It grasped a single picture at the tip of its claw. Assumably the one that had just been taken.

The one that included me.

When it got close, a cluster of photographs on its torso began to rumble and shake. Seconds later, a long, black tongue slithered out between the cramped folds. The tongue writhed over the new picture, manically licking it until it was covered in gray-yellow saliva.

Then, the tongue receded back into its abdomen, like an earthworm into the soil. Once it had vanished, the entity creaked its right arm at the elbow so it could reach its chest, pushing the polaroid against its sternum.

The claw pulled back, and it stuck.

Another for the collection.

An icy grip clamped down on my wrist.

I turned my head. There was a scratched-out, colorless hand over mine.

My eyes traced the appendage up to its origin, but they didn‚Äôt need to. I already knew what I was about to see.

The sofa seemed to stretch on for miles.

Countless scratched-out heads turned to face me, creating a wave down the line. Everyone wanted to see the newcomer, even the oldest shadows at the very, very end.

I did not feel terror.

I experienced a medley of distinct sensations, but none of them were negative.

Peace. Comfort. Fufillment.

Safety. Appreciation.

Love.

Ever since the polaroid snapped, I‚Äôve been smiling.

I can't stop.

I've been in amputee since I was one and know no different.  

Confidence has always been an issue for me, over the past few years I've been more confident than I've ever been in my whole life. 
Part of it is over the last few years I've worked harder to improve myself than I ever have in my whole life.  I won't go into details but it's all along the lines of meditation, Hard work and self-improvement.  

I've only dated two girls in my whole life.  Both over the internet in my teen years.  
I'm a good looking man, at least everybody says that.  Although it's hard to believe it all the time.  I'm very self critical.  I love myself very much and that again is one of those things I've tried to improve although in moments like these.   It's not easy to see the path ahead incredibly clear.  

Now excuse this little buildup for the conclusion will be worth it.  I have done numerous things within a few years.  From the age of 16, I was working incredibly hard on a ranch and learn to use all sorts of equipment and a very disciplined mentality towards the work and that discipline. I then applied to different parts of my life.  
I have ran a pretty successful business for my teen years, working on more businesses now And eventually I plan on having my own tractor freelance operation or something along those lines.  
I've taught myself all sorts of stuff and didn't have to go to high school because it wasn't really a growing environment for me but it didn't lend itself to much socialization among people my age.    Although I've socialized in many other ways and one of my best friends is an 80-year-old man who I love dearly.

As of recently I picked up college classes and I'm trying to learn other skills including working very hard at becoming a good guitarist.  I also have been working out very hard and am stronger than I've ever been in my whole life.  All those things aren't incredibly positive and I love my life
Although it's hard to always see it through such a positive lens.  
At times I get it in my head that all these positive things would be all the more positive and life would be that of a dream if I wasn't missing my left leg.  I can function about just as well as any other human can besides certant movements that aren't as easy but I can run. I have done all sorts of sports and charismatic and wellspoken.  

Well I've known this one girl for a little while now. I think it worked on a farm I would get my feed from and decided to ask her out to coffee.  Long story short, she rejected it and in a nice way but it did sting initially and I've taken my lesson in stride and learned from it that at the same time in the back of my mind I just wonder if I'll ever find somebody I I can really love.  I'm a family man, I love children. I especially want women.  I've always been of a sensitive nature. Girls appeal to me for their sensitivity and overall loveliness.    

I treat everybody so kindly, I'm so sweet and understanding to people and ask such good questions and am so good at interacting with them yet only have about two friends and have had a girlfriend in 6 years. 

The reason I'm kind of on this mental spiral is because I've dealt with unbelievable amounts of discrimination in my life due to my leg so yes, it is most likely that that girl just wasn't into me had a boyfriend, whatever it was.   

Just a side note.  I'm not trying to be a pessimist or negative in any way, shape or form. I'm really just trying to put it well how I'm feeling in this kind of bitter moment after having been rejected by a girl I liked not an hour ago.  I'm already feeling pretty good about it and recovering quickly and writing down different lessons such as going with my gut about stuff like that. Which I definitely went against it in this case because I wasn't sure she liked me from the get-go. 
This girl girl by no means was in the man really. She was just being polite and kind on repeated interactions with me and so I kind of dreamed it up into something that it wasn't and it really isn't a big deal at all. It's just the old habit of self-criticism.

If you have any kind words I'd love to hear it would be much appreciated. ",5,1757463282.0,amputee,6,1.0,False

1nczl3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1nczl3y/theres_something_wrong_with_my_boss/,There's Something Wrong With My Boss,"It was my first day at the new job, and the office already felt off. Not necessarily in a bad way, just something subtle.

My boss, Dan, was the first to meet me. He had this smile that made me cringe and a tone that made every greeting feel like a performance.

***‚ÄúWelcome aboard! We‚Äôre going to have so much fun together!‚Äù*** he said, shaking my hand with an enthusiastic grip.

He led me around, introducing me to everyone.

***‚ÄúThis is Jess, she handles accounting. Mark over here is marketing. And over there, that's my p.a, Tim‚Ä¶don‚Äôt worry, he‚Äôs harmless,‚Äù*** he said with a wink, and the hairs on my arms instantly stood on end. We continued introductions and everyone smiled politely, but none of them really said much.

The first week passed by in a blur. Spreadsheets, emails, and awkward coffee breaks. By the following Monday, I felt comfortable enough to ask a burning question.

‚ÄúSo, uh‚Ä¶what‚Äôs up with Dan?‚Äù I asked Jess one afternoon. ‚ÄúBit‚Ä¶*odd*, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

Jess paused, chewing her sandwich, then leaned in. *‚ÄúDude, you have no idea,‚Äù* she said. *‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶intense. Like, unnervingly nice. And he hovers. You‚Äôll see,""* she said with a casual wave.

I laughed it off at the time, assuming she was just exaggerating. But over the next week, Dan started showing up at my desk when I wasn‚Äôt expecting him. He lingered near the printer watching me work and started complimenting me for tasks I hadn‚Äôt even finished. Everything he did or said felt slightly‚Ä¶*ick.*

By Friday, I was starting to get comfortable in my role. The pay was great after all and everyone else seemed nice. I even made them all laugh by mocking Dan's *""team harmony""* poster he'd hung in the break room.

That evening, I was left to close up for the first time. I was filing some last minute paperwork when a faint rattling sound caught my attention.

It came from a small drawer built into one of the cabinets near the supply closet. I hesitated at first, my heart slightly thumping, but curiosity got the better of me.

I unlocked it...and froze.

Inside, perfectly arranged on a large shelf, were miniature versions of my coworkers. Jess, Mark, even Susanna who's now on maternity leave‚Ä¶all captured in precise detail and frozen mid-task like grotesque action figures: typing, stapling, eating. The details were insane.

I stumbled back, nearly dropping the drawer, and it hit me.

*Oh God!* Dan hadn‚Äôt been an overly eager boss and monitoring me casually. He‚Äôd been...*studying me.* Archiving me. *Cataloging me!*

I backed away, barely breathing, my heart raging inside my chest.

**""Don't you like them?""** Tim's whispering voice made me scream, and I spun around. **""When I first met you,""** he said. **""I thought you were far too nice to make the shelf...""**

He walked towards me.

""Tim...""

**""But then you made fun of the poster...""**

""Tim...please...""

But he just smiled, and continued walking forward.

**""The boss will see you in his office now.""**

Well I've known this one girl for a little while now. I think it worked on a farm I would get my feed from and decided to ask her out to coffee.  Long story short, she rejected it and in a nice way but it did sting initially and I've taken my lesson in stride and learned from it that at the same time in the back of my mind I just wonder if I'll ever find somebody I I can really love.  I'm a family man, I love children. I especially want women.  I've always been of a sensitive nature. Girls appeal to me for their sensitivity and overall loveliness.    

I treat everybody so kindly, I'm so sweet and understanding to people and ask such good questions and am so good at interacting with them yet only have about two friends and have had a girlfriend in 6 years. 

The reason I'm kind of on this mental spiral is because I've dealt with unbelievable amounts of discrimination in my life due to my leg so yes, it is most likely that that girl just wasn't into me had a boyfriend, whatever it was.   

Just a side note.  I'm not trying to be a pessimist or negative in any way, shape or form. I'm really just trying to put it well how I'm feeling in this kind of bitter moment after having been rejected by a girl I liked not an hour ago.  I'm already feeling pretty good about it and recovering quickly and writing down different lessons such as going with my gut about stuff like that. Which I definitely went against it in this case because I wasn't sure she liked me from the get-go. 
This girl girl by no means was in the man really. She was just being polite and kind on repeated interactions with me and so I kind of dreamed it up into something that it wasn't and it really isn't a big deal at all. It's just the old habit of self-criticism.

If you have any kind words I'd love to hear it would be much appreciated. ",1,1757462974.0,helpme,1,1.0,False
1nczhkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1nczhkf/forming_deeper_friendships/,forming deeper friendships,"okay so i'm not here to ask like how to make friends in the first place, put yourself out there and join clubs are like the only 2 answers, both i do. i'm a sophomore at a new college, clubs at this school for some reason meet like once a month or biweekly, one of them i am vice pres of though. as far as putting myself out there, i have handfuls of one off conversations all day that just go nowhere? People approach me, I approach them, we compliment each other or ask what book are you reading or what assignment are you working on, and the conversations great for like the 5-10 mins that we have it, but after that it's ""alright i gotta get to class!"" and i never see them again lmao.

Even some that i've gotten their insta's/numbers we still don't keep in touch. I have atleast like 2-3 of these little conversations with randoms per day. There's a guy that i met that does say hi to me everytime we see each other (which is oddly becoming everyday..) and my roommates are nice and we chit chat if we run into each other in the kitchen, but other than that literally nobody leaves their rooms. I don't even know if they're here 85% of the time. i also am not on a meal plan to use the dining hall bc its too expensive and i have my own kitchen. 

So basically my question is what are some things you guys do at school to build on relationships/friendships with people? I'm totally fine with talking to people but when it comes to seeing them again and like continuing to get to know each other it just feels like the opportunity never presents itself? or like it feels unnecessary or weird to ask ""oh wait do you actually wanna get coffee and keep talking"" when all the person said was ""your nails are rlly cute did you get them done by someone around here?"" or something yk? I've only been in school a month so do i just need to give it more time or something lmao. I'm just so quiet all the time outside of these convos i have to literally like stretch my jaw out sometimes im sooo ready to talk more and hangout lol.",2,1757462948.0,college,0,1.0,False

You may have heard of ""Scamanda,"" but I have a local grifter who gives her a run for her money. This individual has been running a complex con, manipulating people's empathy for financial gain while living a lifestyle that completely contradicts her stated struggles.

She consistently pleads poverty, claiming she can't afford groceries or bills, yet her Instagram tells a different story: daily coffee runs, professional photoshoots, facials, and fresh hair and nails. Her primary income seems to be from subpar digital artwork, sold to sympathetic followers under the false pretense of keeping her afloat. quite frankly a 4 year old on an IPad could do better.

The most egregious part of her scam, however, is the fraudulent medical claims. She allegedly lied about having cancer, stating she miraculously went into remission after just three chemo treatments‚Äîa medical improbability that exposes the entire charade. She claims to have no support system, dismissing the very people offering her sound advice from their own life experiences as ""not understanding"" her. She even vilifies her homeless parents while apparently having the means to help them.

The pattern doesn't stop there. Her stories are consistently crafted to make her a victim while omitting crucial details:

¬∑ She claimed to be raped but provided only a fragment of the story, painting a man as ""creepy"" while leaving out her own role in the situation.
¬∑ She reported her car stolen but admitted to leaving her keys, purse, and all valuables inside it, then attacked anyone who questioned that decision as ""disrespectful.""

When she was finally called out on her inconsistencies and lies, her response was to deactivate her dog's Instagram account and play the victim yet again, claiming she has ""no real friends,"" despite abandoning the very community that supported her from the beginning.

This isn't about struggling with medical issues. This is about getting caught. You got caught in your grift, your con, your scam. So you‚Äôre running away to find new people to manipulate.

A word of warning: your lies have a lifespan. The photography community is tight-knit, and your false accusations of sexual assault will catch up to you, resulting in you being blacklisted entirely. You're about to find out. Good luck‚Äîyou're going to need it.",2,1757462605.0,scamslam,0,1.0,False

I've been in amputee since I was one and know no different.  

Confidence has always been an issue for me, over the past few years I've been more confident than I've ever been in my whole life. 
Part of it is over the last few years I've worked harder to improve myself than I ever have in my whole life.  I won't go into details but it's all along the lines of meditation, Hard work and self-improvement.  

I've only dated two girls in my whole life.  Both over the internet in my teen years.  
I'm a good looking man, at least everybody says that.  Although it's hard to believe it all the time.  I'm very self critical.  I love myself very much and that again is one of those things I've tried to improve although in moments like these.   It's not easy to see the path ahead incredibly clear.  

Now excuse this little buildup for the conclusion will be worth it.  I have done numerous things within a few years.  From the age of 16, I was working incredibly hard on a ranch and learn to use all sorts of equipment and a very disciplined mentality towards the work and that discipline. I then applied to different parts of my life.  
I have ran a pretty successful business for my teen years, working on more businesses now And eventually I plan on having my own tractor freelance operation or something along those lines.  
I've taught myself all sorts of stuff and didn't have to go to high school because it wasn't really a growing environment for me but it didn't lend itself to much socialization among people my age.    Although I've socialized in many other ways and one of my best friends is an 80-year-old man who I love dearly.

As of recently I picked up college classes and I'm trying to learn other skills including working very hard at becoming a good guitarist.  I also have been working out very hard and am stronger than I've ever been in my whole life.  All those things aren't incredibly positive and I love my life
Although it's hard to always see it through such a positive lens.  
At times I get it in my head that all these positive things would be all the more positive and life would be that of a dream if I wasn't missing my left leg.  I can function about just as well as any other human can besides certant movements that aren't as easy but I can run. I have done all sorts of sports and charismatic and wellspoken.

now girls here may relate to this. she tells me, also in groups of friends, that she ""is staying away from all men, shutting them out"", which im 99% sure is cuz her relationships ha e ended badly in the past. now of course i respect that as im not a sex crazed creep. i respect boundaries, hence i havent asked her out. but she tells me things like ""i need to try and love myself before others"".shes i guess insecure about her body image (mainly), and in turn, i say in the least creepy way possible that she looks fine, yknow just the reassurance couples give one another. and she likes that. 

but thing is, i do wanna ask her out. weve known each other for 2 months. we talk so well to each other and shes even told me she considers me a bestie, she calls me pure, different, etc etc. and shes even said we connect well. 

all this tells me that she likes me (as a friend or more idk) and i guess im fretting that if i dont ask her, someone else could come along, and j just dont wanna sit on the sidelines.

1ncz64d,https://www.reddit.com/r/cdifficile/comments/1ncz64d/c_diff_success/,C. Diff success,"I have debated writing this but when I was diagnosed everything I read online was seriously daunting and depressing. It all started in May, I had to go to urgent care for a UTI. I don‚Äôt typically get them - it has been years but when I got the symptoms I wanted to nip in the bud. The NP there prescribed me with macrobid and did not culture the ruined about five days later the symptoms returned and when I called the UC back they once again did not offer a urine culture and prescribed a wide spectrum antibiotic. 
A few days later, I thought I had food poisoning. C. Diff didn‚Äôt even cross my mind. Eight days later I could not stay off the toilet still and this time, I had a high fever and stomach pain. My mom stopped by and convinced me to go to at least go back to the urgent care where they sent me directly to the emergency room. The pain worsened and symptoms were insane I could barely make it to the bathroom. After a CT showing severe colitis, getting my fever down with IV Tylenol and pain meds they took a stool sample and said they would call me the next day. The doctor mentioned they would test for various things and mentioned C. difficile but said ‚Äúyou are a healthy 32 year old woman I doubt it‚Äôs that.‚Äù When I got the positive result I went into full panic mode. I have a four year old and one bathroom I share with my husband and it‚Äôs been 9 days now. And the more I read on Google the more I read on here I was absolutely terrified. The idea of recurrence petrified me. 
I was prescribed the typical 14 day Vancomycin treatment. I followed up with my GP but also did my own research. Bought the book love your gut and deep dived online for hours into what worked for people. I am also newly certified in herbal medicine. This is what I did and it worked for me and if I could help one person I‚Äôd be happy. 
I started out just water, chamomile&lavender herbal infusions (tea) at night. Soups, broth. Some crackers until the vanco stopped the diarrhea. 
Immediately I began taking Floratsor‚Äôs Saccharomyces Boulardii probiotic. 2 capsules twice a day for two weeks. Then 1 capsule twice a day for an additional two weeks. 
In the mean time, I ate a hard boiled egg for breakfast, one piece sour dough toast and kefir or yogurt. 
For lunch I had cashews and very small amounts of Whole Foods. Basically nothing with an ingredient list. Avocado, apple, sauerkraut, gf crackers. 
Dinner I had grilled chicken, sweet potato and something fermented like kimchi or pickled food. And lots of dark leafy green salads. 
After all my research I found to slowly add in dairy and gluten so you don‚Äôt develop an allergy. You are recreating your gut biome completely and everything to add counts. 
I had no sugar at all except fruit or raw honey. 
Herbal tea like chamomile and lavender are really gentle and helpful on the gut.
I started ION liquid gut support supplement.
By week four I felt well enough to try filet mignon, sweet potato and kale. Always adding something fermented or probiotic as well. 
By week five I had a glass of wine. 
By week eight I was just making sure I had all Whole Foods and probiotics in my diet whether from food or another good capsule. I was even drinking green tea for some caffeine finally. 
I am now almost four months later able to live normally. I have changed the way I think about food for sure. I lost 28lbs. And re built my gut. 
I can drink when I want now, have a cup of coffee and feel like I can live normally again. 
That being said if I do drink I take probiotics about two hours later. I make sure to keep probiotics in my daily diet. 
I highly recommend trying this method if you‚Äôre diagnosed and feeling lost and scared and overwhelmed with the negative recurrence out comes on here and honestly maybe I‚Äôll be back on here in 6 months the lost and scared again but this method did work. 
My family stayed stare because I bleached the bathroom too to bottom after every use and washed my hands constantly.

1ncz0qi,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1ncz0qi/surviving_month_4/,Surviving month 4,"I‚Äôm not sure if the point of this post is to look for tips, encouragement, or just to rant‚Ä¶or maybe all three? My baby is just shy of 4 months and the last couple weeks have been ROUGH. He has always been a bad sleeper (never gotten more than like a 2 hour stretch) but lately it has been impossible! He is up literally every 40 minutes, sometimes even less, and takes ages to put back down. Sometimes he‚Äôs inconsolable.

He‚Äôs also gotten so much fussier during the day, and needs constant attention. This obviously wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal at all if I was getting any sort of sleep at night, but when I‚Äôm trying to make myself a morning coffee and he‚Äôs screaming I really, really struggle.

I also used to always be able to calm him down by feeding, but now every time we nurse he gets fussy 2 minutes in and starts to cry and wiggle and latches on and off. I know it‚Äôs normal for them to get distracted at this age because they are waking up to the world around them, but the screaming?! I feel like he‚Äôs barely getting any good, solid feeds in which is probably why he is so fussy all the time.

To the parents that have made it past month 4: does this all sound normal? how did you do it? Will they eventually grow out of it on their own or do we need to work even harder on some things?

We‚Äôre working on independent sleep and try to put him down drowsy but awake any opportunity we can, but it has only worked maybe 10% of the time - the other 90% of attempts he SCREAMS and it takes ages to calm him again. I feel really discouraged that he will ever fall asleep on his own, and if he doesn‚Äôt, will his sleep ever get better?? I can‚Äôt do the 40 minute wake-ups anymore! Even waking every 2 hours sounds like a dream at this point.

A gush about the diverse/queer series that I love (and a plea for more if you've got a favorite),"Maybe it's my hyperfixation talking, but I love getting wrapped up in a series of books.  That feeling where you finish a book and there's no wondering what you're reading next, because it's absolutely the next book about these same people.  Usually they're based around a small town, or a particular place of business, or a friend or family group.  

I particularly love series about diverse or queer characters - they often have heartwarming found family groups or perspectives I hadn't considered before, which adds a lot to my enjoyment of the book.  While looking for new series today I was coming up blank, and so I started writing a request post but I had so many examples that it kind of turned into a gush.  Whoops.  

So, here's a long list of my favorite diverse series!  I'm listing series with three books or more, completely published.  The series below are centered on characters other than white cishet MF romance, although some series include books with those pairings.  Also a disclaimer about my own personal taste - I tend to read more contemporary/historical and less scifi/fantasy, and I generally stay on the lighter side.  I'll link the series on [romance.io](http://romance.io) as well.  



# Historical

* [The Sedgewick Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5a658d634c555d0db5773150/seducing-the-sedgwicks) by Cat Sebastian - this is a Regency MM series and centers around three brothers whose father was a bad guy, and they've all dealt with that in different ways.  The first book is basically a gay Sound of Music (the vicar moves in with a widowed sea captain to help him manage his ungovernable children) and it's a delight.  
* [Las Leonas Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6295bd03c74d8cb242f25b65/las-lonas) by Adriana Herrera - a mix of MF and FF, this is a fantastic Victorian-era series that tackles social issues while still bringing both sweet romantic moments and hot-as-hell steam.  There are three strong Latina heroines, one a business woman, one an artist, and one a doctor, and I found all of their stories so compelling.  The setting in Paris approaching the turn-of-the-century was fantastic as well.
* [The Wedgeford Trials Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5f6850342b48890dd5abe609/wedgeford-trials) by Courtney Milan - another Victorian-era series set in a real-life small town in England that was home to a large number of Chinese immigrants.  I particularly enjoyed the heroine in the first book, she's Type A and the hero loves her for it, but you get to know the town and side characters and become immersed in the world.  
* [The Women Who Dare Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5c76ef5dcd817c0d8ffff811/women-who-dare) by Beverly Jenkins - you can't really go wrong with Beverly Jenkins and her portrayal of Black history, but I love this series for the strong heroines and the bold choices they make.  The second book has a heroine who literally rescues the hero from a snowstorm, she's such a badass.  
* [The Society of Gentlemen Series](https://www.romance.io/series/58fe0ac09096bf31c42d2e74/society-of-gentlemen) by KJ Charles - a Regency MM series that revolves mainly around class differences.  KJ Charles writes wonderful intrigue and political drama as well, so these are romances with a suspense/action edge.  Many of her books are duos and thus didn't make the list, but Society of Gentlemen has three books and two novellas too.  
* [The Loyal League Series](https://www.romance.io/series/58fe188f4167a73342632235/the-loyal-league) by Alyssa Cole - this is a Civil War-era MF series set in the US.  In the first book, the heroine is a spy for the Union, undercover as a slave in a powerful household, and she teams up with another undercover spy who's posing as the family's friend.  It's a unique setting and Cole is wonderful at blending the history in with the romance and action.
* [The Luna Sisters Series](https://www.romance.io/series/640d1cdebd39598013b6ee21/the-luna-sisters) by Liana De la Rosa - this Victorian-era series revolves around three heiress sisters from Mexico whose father seeks to marry them to titled men in London.  I enjoyed the marriage of convenience stories as well as learning a bit more about Mexican history as well.
* [The Cabot Series](https://www.romance.io/series/606ffe6fac2aed0e3ab68aa4/the-cabots) by Cat Sebastian - I know I already mentioned Cat Sebastian, but I love this MM series because it takes place in the 1950's-70's United States which is.an underrepresented period.  It shows several members of a fictional politically-connected family (like the Kennedys) and the last book is my favorite as the plot is the most delightful, gentle thing about saving a community garden.  



# Contemporary - Small Town

* [The Garnet Run Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6032288312c5f80e1d62dcb1/garnet-run) by Roan Parrish - this is so cozy and fluffy, while still having deep characters and a lot of heart.  It takes place in a fictonal, queer-friendly small town in Wyoming and features such plots as a dog-walker falling for his client and a neighborhood holiday decorating contest.   
* [The Forbidden Hearts Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5975903d7b1a971bdc924ccf/forbidden-hearts) by Alisha Rai - this revolves around a long-standing family feud, and through the series there are secrets revealed.  The first book has a fantastic tattoo artist heroine and a long-standing hate-fucking relationship that turns into more, which is hot as hell.  
* [The Heart and Soul Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6267aae2c060509b3aad836f/heart-soul) by Synithia Williams - This revolves a trio of brothers who are amatuar ghost-hunters, and it's spooky and fun.  It's got a thread of supernatural but mostly feels small-town, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  
* [The American Dreamers Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5c7ccdd214d4fe0db08b011a/dreamers) by Adriana Herrera - this is a mostly MM series revolving around Latin immigrants in a small town in upstate New York.  I loved the characters and their immigration stories feel even more poignant now.  
* [The Cowboys of California Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5e54c751236e020e81e1f284/cowboys-of-california) by Rebekah Weatherspoon - this is a series of fairytale retellings set on a ranch in California, and it's completely delightful.  
* [The Bright Falls Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6214983865d89a0e1f7b8af9/bright-falls) by Ashley Herring Blake - this FF series is full of amazing characters, but Delilah Green from book 1 is a standout and I loved seeing her throughout the remaining books.  The town is lovely and there are some interesting family relationships to explore as well.  
* [The Red Dirt Series](https://www.romance.io/series/58fe0a719096bf31c42d2d8b/red-dirt) by N.R. Walker - I'm including this because it's such a beautiful setting, even though it's a five-book series dedicated to just one couple.  It's set on a ranch in the middle of Australia, and the desert was so vividly described it was like another character.  



# Contemporary - General

* [The Reluctant Royals Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5a83e241ee6cc90db73145b2/reluctant-royals) by Alyssa Cole - this delightful, nerdy series is one of my favorites.  From a PHD student heroine in the first book, to the Scottish swordmaker hero later on, it's a great mix of characters and humor.  The spinoff [Runaway Royals duet](https://www.romance.io/series/5fbcc21459f5260e0fbf276d/runaway-royals) is great too!  
* [The Teachers in Love Series](https://www.romance.io/series/643ad1228de91c6932f3f6eb/teachers-in-love) by MA Wardell - this MM series is the perfect blend of compelling, heartwarming characters and steam, with a little kink thrown in.  It revolves around characters who work in a school, and while I loved the first book and its single dad/kindergarten teacher romance, the third book has the older bisexual principal finding love, so sweet!  
* [The Boyfriend Project Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5ece129ce7ed6d0e294c53cd/the-boyfriend-project) by Farrah Rochon - this series has such a fun premise - three women  find out they're dating the same man, and promptly become besties and kick him to the curb.  They find love over the subsequent trilogy, and all of the heroines are so smart and strong, I enjoyed them a lot.  
* [The Love at Knockdown Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5fc5f99d9babb10e0695ef49/love-at-knockdown) by Skye Kilaen - this series revolves around a coffee shop in Austin,  Texas, and features a variety of pairings.  My favorite book is the third, which features a bi-for-bi math teacher hero and an older programmer heroine.  
* [The Spires Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5e3916f64fcb0a0de0452125/spires-universe) by Alexis Hall - I adore this MM series but the books are only verrrry loosely related, so it doesn't work if you're looking for an evolving friend or family group.  However, the books are all excellently written and contain some of my favorite characters ever.  
* [The Nashville Love Series](https://www.romance.io/series/66e1f16cefaccd2ff07ad59b/nashville-love) by Anita Kelly - this is a queer series around a group of friends in Nashville, and it's a lot of fun.  The second book has characters who meet while through-hiking the PCT, and the environment is gorgeously described.  
* [The Vega Family Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6555c36cc112bf11fe9b93d6/vega-family-love-stories) by Natalie Ca√±a - this series is set around a family in Chicago, and deals with the evolution of community and gentrification in a small neighborhood.  Even though obviously Chicago isn't a small town, I loved how the community felt that way, and how they all cared for each other.  
* [The Boy Meets Boy Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6270edd4e98d4489081ca6f5/boy-meets-boy) by Timothy Janovsky - this series is MM and lower steam, but I loved the characters and the romantic setups were really cute.  The second book features a character that reminds me of David Rose from Schitt's Creek, and it's so sweet to watch him find love.  
* [The Middle of Somewhere Series](https://www.romance.io/series/58fe0b1b9096bf31c42d2f68/middle-of-somewhere) by Roan Parrish - this MM series starts in a small town in Michigan, then moves to Philly and NYC.  The middle book is a character that deals with a lot of internalized homophobia, which was jarring for me at first but I loved how it turned out.  There's crossover with the characters in the [Small Change duet](https://www.romance.io/series/592e5e0ba10567c4f205c15c/small-change), as well.
* [The Written in the Stars Series](https://www.romance.io/series/6095380d33c0510ebb77549c/written-in-the-stars) by Alexandria Bellefleur - this is a fun family/friend series set in Seattle that centers around apps and social media.  There are two FF books and one MF, I enjoyed them all.  
* [The Brown Sisters Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5dafefa4cb90d76a5e46e240/the-brown-sisters) by Talia Hibbert - this is a pretty well known series because it's amazing!  Lots of people love book two for the most extreme cinnamon roll hero ever, but I'm partial to loveable chaos muppet Eve Brown in book 3.  



# Contemporary - Sports

* [The Game Changers Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5c987d20ecc3640db9bf72fd/game-changers) by Rachel Reid - this is a popular MM hockey series, and while Shane and Ilya often take the spotlight, my favorites are Ryan and Fabian in Tough Guy and Troy and Harris in Role Model.   
* [The Six 32 Central Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5b0e3fbf8b1e290dab45967d/six-32-central) by Mina Esguerra - this is a skating series set in Manila, and while not all of the books are totally sports-focused I thought it fit best here.  Book two is a figure skater/hockey player that gives total Cutting Edge vibes, it's so fun.
* [The Unwritten Rules Series](https://www.romance.io/series/62d656fe1c8b3cafbc94d4c8/unwritten-rules) by KD Casey - this is a MM baseball series, and has some incredibly rich character develoment along with a lot of love and knowledge of the game.  
* [The Playbook Series](https://www.romance.io/series/5cbeaa45ff40b70de1306563/playbook) by Alexa Martin - this is an American football series, and the author is the wife of a real-life NFL player so it's clear she knows what she's talking about.  I enjoy her humor and the humanity she brings to the players, it's a fun time.  



Whew... is that all?  I'm not including several that are either incomplete, only two books, or I haven't read all of the books, but this is my list.  Now, what series should I read next?!

1ncyu36,https://i.redd.it/x6gg5drd68of1.jpeg,S-C-A-M-I,"You may have heard of ""Scamanda,"" but I have a local grifter who gives her a run for her money. This individual has been running a complex con, manipulating people's empathy for financial gain while living a lifestyle that completely contradicts her stated struggles.

She consistently pleads poverty, claiming she can't afford groceries or bills, yet her Instagram tells a different story: daily coffee runs, professional photoshoots, facials, and fresh hair and nails. Her primary income seems to be from subpar digital artwork, sold to sympathetic followers under the false pretense of keeping her afloat.

The most egregious part of her scam, however, is the fraudulent medical claims. She allegedly lied about having cancer, stating she miraculously went into remission after just three chemo treatments‚Äîa medical improbability that exposes the entire charade. She claims to have no support system, dismissing the very people offering her sound advice from their own life experiences as ""not understanding"" her. She even vilifies her homeless parents while apparently having the means to help them.

The pattern doesn't stop there. Her stories are consistently crafted to make her a victim while omitting crucial details:

¬∑ She claimed to be raped but provided only a fragment of the story, painting a man as ""creepy"" while leaving out her own role in the situation.
¬∑ She reported her car stolen but admitted to leaving her keys, purse, and all valuables inside it, then attacked anyone who questioned that decision as ""disrespectful.""

When she was finally called out on her inconsistencies and lies, her response was to deactivate her dog's Instagram account and play the victim yet again, claiming she has ""no real friends,"" despite abandoning the very community that supported her from the beginning.

This isn't about struggling with medical issues. This is about getting caught. You got caught in your grift, your con, your scam. So you‚Äôre running away to find new people to manipulate.

A word of warning: your lies have a lifespan. The photography community is tight-knit, and your false accusations of sexual assault will catch up to you, resulting in you being blacklisted entirely.

I'm a passionate ex barista/coffee snob in the sense i know what I like! (don't judge me) 

I took a Barista couse in Australia in 2015 and have been obsessed with making espresso coffees ever since. 

Ive had my eye on the personal machines above but do see they come with a hefty price tag (I'm in Canada). 

For those of you who have these machines, what do you love about it? Was this your first purchase? I trained on this brand and Wega and loved that they were manual machines. I enjoy timing my extractions and steaming the milk, might sound weird but it brings me alot of joy getting the milk to the wet paint consistency. Pouring on the other hand, I need more practice. 

Id he using this machine in my home for myself and company. I'm a one man band but enjoy hosting.

Lets chat about what machine you have, its upkeep, maintenance, grinder, all the things! My budget is closer to $3K but I don't exactly buy nice things for myself and really want this so Its a loose budget.

1ncyst4,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ncyst4/my_roommate_came_home_last_night_i_dont_think_it/,"My roommate came home last night, I don‚Äôt think it was him.","7:07 P.M.
I sunk so deeply into the couch my body felt like it was melting into the leather that stuck to my skin. I love my lazy nights, the type where my feet forget the feel of anything other than my fuzzy socks. When I try to stop myself from eating all the ice cream I have in my freezer in a single sitting. The windows were all shut and locked and the ac blasted since my roommate finally wasn‚Äôt there to complain about the cost, but he knew he loved the cold just as much as I did. His cat laid right on the small coffee table in front of me next to the stray cheeseballs and the remote that was still out of batteries. Wilbur purred so loudly I could barely hear the faint voices on the tv. Nothing interesting is on anyway, just some random cartoons so I didn‚Äôt really mind. I just hate a quiet house. 
While I hid from the quiet that threatened to fill the room if I dared to turn the tv off, Wilbur stretched his body and curved his spine into a crescent moon around the tv remote that laid as useless as I. He stood up and pawed at the empty plastic tub of cheeseballs like he was demanding it to refill itself. ‚ÄúYea buddy me too..‚Äù I muttered as my stomach growled louder than my voice. God, where the hell is Blake. I‚Äôm about to start eating Wilbur‚Äôs tuna mush if I have to wait any longer. 
The couch creaked and moaned under me as I forced myself up onto my achy feet. The dingy light in the kitchen barely illuminated the walls without the natural light coming in from the windows, but I can‚Äôt get behind the idea of the curtains being open at night. I opened the door of the fridge and my knees popped like they always do as I crouched down to see what may still remain in our tiny fridge. I was disappointed but not surprised. Soy sauce, mustard, iceberg lettuce with what was either a small rodent living on it or a large amount of mold, and a whole lot of nothing else. I should probably throw that away soon.
 I thought about showering for the first time in two days but, against my better judgement, I flopped back toward the couch. And as I walked back from the kitchen I took a detour to the front window of our house, I just need to take a peak sometimes. Some feeling down my spine always seems to remind me to rethink my safety for no particular reason. Unsurprisingly nothing was out of the ordinary. The moon shined down on our street just as it always did, onto my car with the rust and scratches that covered it, and the spot for Blake‚Äôs car just as empty as it has been since he left. Snow iced over the street, every inch of it looked perfect and fluffy Miss Evans walked her dog down the sidewalk as she always did. But I paused before my next thought. Why's Grant just waiting outside his house across the street? He‚Äôs not even moving or knocking. Whatever, Katie will let him in once she realizes he‚Äôs waiting. The only light that shined through his house and its closed door was the familiar glow of the aquarium through the window. I took a breath realizing it really is just in my head again, walking back to the couch I let myself fall right back into my spot passing out right then and there. 
	Knock. Knock.
	Two quiet almost taps came from the front door but woke me up just as much as any sound would. 
	‚ÄúHey Dev, can you let me in please. Its so fucking cold out here. The snow is really getting to me.‚Äù Blake‚Äôs voice crept in through the bottom crack in the door. 
	It took me a moment to realize I was awake and not dreaming but slowly got up realizing he forgot his key again. He hasn‚Äôt remembered to grab it all week and I‚Äôm getting sick of being woken up by him. At least I can eat now. I hobbled over to the door, my head awake but my legs were still ready for bed barely wanting to move. I cracked open the door leaving just enough room for my head to peek through and glare at him through the metal screen type door we had as extra protection in our nice old people filled neighborhood. 
	‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the food Blake.‚Äù I could see his face drop from a faint smile to a frown as I blatantly demanded my meal without any first greetings. 
	He sighed before talking back, ‚ÄúDev please, I‚Äôve had a long day, I‚Äôm still getting over Chelsea and I forgot to get anything on the way out.. Please just let me in, you know I hate the cold.‚Äù I could see on his face he was tired of my bullshit. But I am not budging.
	‚ÄúChelsea broke up with you two months ago and I am fucking starving. Now you have one option here, you drive back to the store, get us some food before it gets too late and I will let you in and we can talk about your day. The store is only a few miles away, you'll be back in 10 minutes or less.‚Äù I fought back, refusing to go to bed hungry again.
	He looked pissed, pausing, staring me in the eyes just waiting for me to open the door for a second, it was a bit eerie till he spoke again, ‚ÄúDev, bro, I‚Äôm freezing just standing here waiting. I‚Äôm telling you, any longer out here and my blood is going to turn into a slushie and I don‚Äôt think my veins can handle‚Äì‚Äù 
I cut him off when my mind finally caught up to the words he said, ‚ÄúWait, what do you mean you hate the cold? I only just realized you said that. You and I both know how warmblooded you are. Blake, you went out yesterday in shorts and sandals.. with a foot of snow blocking our door.‚Äù 
	He exhaled sharply before just chuckling under his breath, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know Dev I just haven‚Äôt been as warm recently. Honestly can you just let me in though, I‚Äôll grab a jacket and you can come with me and we can go eat out somewhere. I got some extra tips today at work and I can use them to get us a nice dinner, maybe we can go to a steak house or something, let‚Äôs go crazy for a night. Just a little bit couldn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù He spoke so softly and smoothly now but he started to scratch at his cheek as he attempted to convince me. 
I caught myself staring at his hand more than his face now. The way his nails dragged over his cheek looked too casual at first, but he didn‚Äôt stop. Just a light scrape, again and again, until the skin there went red. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre bleeding,‚Äù I muttered, before I could stop myself.
He said so casually, ‚ÄúOh shit, my skin must be dry from this weather. Fuck can you let me in I gotta clean this up.‚Äù His mouth moved before his face did, like he wasn‚Äôt reacting to the pain but my words instead. Like the blood didn‚Äôt even bother him. But his voice wasn‚Äôt convincing, and the sound of his fingernails pulling away was sharper than it should‚Äôve been, like fabric tearing against itself, leaving a flap that slightly curled over off of his face leaving the raw red meat visible. I looked back behind me after feeling a chill down my spine and realized Wilbur was protected by the couch like a shield, hiding his body and peeked a single eye around the corner. He snickered letting the air breeze breathe through him, ‚ÄúYou just look so damn warm in there. You gotta share a little, right?‚Äù He chuckled after like he said something funny as I stared blankly at him. ‚ÄúSo warm. So soft.‚Äù
‚ÄúAre you on something Blake? Be honest with me right now because something about this is not right. Can you just stay somewhere else tonight?‚Äù My voice was shaky as I struggled to keep my body and words steady. I was more uneasy that I‚Äôve ever been.
He stood still staring me in the eyes like he was still just waiting for the answer he wanted and wouldn‚Äôt budge without it, ‚ÄúDev,‚Äù he whispered. Softer now. So soft I almost thought I imagined it. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me stay out here. I don‚Äôt feel like myself.‚Äù He said as he placed his face closer to the steel door. His blood left a trail on the open fence, he left a mark on his territory. 
‚ÄúBlake I can‚Äôt deal with this right now, just go rent a motel for a night and I‚Äôll pay you back, if you want to warm up so bad use the heater in your‚Äî Blake. Where‚Äôs your car?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt even thinking before I spoke anymore, the words weren‚Äôt making sense, nothing was.  
His eyes flickered for a moment, like he had to remember the right answer, before he finally said, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt drive.‚Äù
I felt the words sink in. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt drive? Blake, it‚Äôs three miles to the store, in a foot of snow. What the fuck do you mean?‚Äù My eyes snapped to the right, quick, just a dart before shooting back to him. Left, right, left again, fast enough to keep him in my sight. But I caught it. The hook by the door. Empty. His keys weren‚Äôt there. They‚Äôre always there. He drills it into me. ‚ÄúPut it back, Dev, put it back, you lose it, that‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù His voice replayed in my head, smug, certain. But the hook was bare. My chest tightened and I forgot how to breathe for a second. Is he fucking with me?
Blake tilted his head against the door, slow, steady, like he knew what I was thinking. The grin didn‚Äôt move but his eyes sharpened. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôd you see, Dev?‚Äù
I opened my fist that I didn‚Äôt even remember forming, fighting against the sweaty sticky grab of my palm and fingers. ‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù I said too quickly, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúNothing, man.. Just please go somewhere else.‚Äù 
Blake chuckled under his breath, low and soft, but then it stretched too long, like he was waiting for me to laugh with him. His face fell flat as he locked eyes with me still just inches from the metal, ‚ÄúDev,‚Äù he whispered again, soft as the snow outside. ‚ÄúPlease. You don‚Äôt even have to open it all the way. Just a little bit.‚Äù His face was coming apart the longer he stood there. The skin didn‚Äôt sit right on him, hanging too loose, like it had been stitched back on wrong. Every time his cheek twitched the flap tugged lower, tearing at the seams. When he smiled, it wasn‚Äôt even a smile anymore, just raw muscle showing through where the corners of his mouth had split. The sound was worse than the sight. Every shift of his expression came with a squelch, a slow peel, like pulling the raw skin from a wet piece of chicken. He tilted his head against the steel door and the skin along his temple slid half an inch out of place before catching on the bone.My stomach turned and my eyes slipped past him without meaning to. Anywhere else. Anywhere that wasn‚Äôt that. But something caught my eye in the background, somehow took my attention from this nightmare. Grant‚Äôs door was swung wide open, the empty black of his living room looked like a pitch black pit. In the midst of our quiet neighborhood somehow Grant's house seemed even more quiet. When did he go in? How long has that door been open?
Blake cut off my thoughts like he could hear them, like he was thinking with me as he looked back at Grant‚Äôs house, ‚ÄúWhat are you looking at Dev?‚Äù He spoke with a grin on his face, the peels now falling lower than they had before. 
‚ÄúW-where did Grant go Blake? Did you do something to him?‚Äù I studdered, it didn‚Äôt make sense but I didn‚Äôt know what the fuck was wrong with Blake right now, what was going on in his brain. Was it breaking down just as much as his body was right now?
He gave me a condescending look and as he scrunched his eyebrows the skin between them squished like the skin was one size too big. ‚ÄúYou've been here with me Dev.. I never moved. I guess they just let him in. He must‚Äôve been cold.‚Äù He said without a blink or any sign of an expression other than that same fucking smile. 
The empty black across the street swallowed me whole. The snow around the porch looked untouched, no prints, no sign he‚Äôd even gone inside. The house was pitch black no window lit, not a single light, just the empty black of what lay inside. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I muttered under my breath, shaking my head like I could knock sense back into it. 
His laugh came out wrong. Thin, breathy, cut in half like it didn‚Äôt belong to him. Blake whispered, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one left making this hard Dev.‚Äù Wilbur growled again this time at the sound of his words, louder this time, and I could hear his claws scratching the floorboards as he bolted deeper into the house.
I slammed the wooden door in his face just so I could at least imagine I wasn‚Äôt in this situation. My fingers missed more times than I could count as I grabbed my phone before I heard the operator,‚Äù911, what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù Her voice was the first hope I‚Äôve had since he knocked on my door.
My eyes were locked on the door as I spoke like my body was afraid he still had the key on him. Every syllable rattled in my throat as I tried to whisper just loud enough for her to hear me, ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs outside my house. My roommate. He won‚Äôt leave me alone. He‚Äôs bleeding, he‚Äôs not making sense, I-I think he‚Äôs on something.‚ÄùI checked through the peephole just to make sure he was still there and the sight made me sick. His face was sealed onto the metal door with his eye glaring straight into mine through the lens. For a second it looked like he couldn‚Äôt even separate himself from the shield that stood between us, until he tried to move away. He tugged once with no give before he put his hands to the door and pushed with a slow pull as his face peeled off and stuck onto the door like the masks Blake‚Äôs girlfriend used to do. The sickly red ooze that stuck kept it on pulled like strings of melted cheese still holding onto his face. The only visual left was his bare muscle and fat that laid underneath and the eyes that sat in their now visible sockets. My words were stuck in my throat so much that I had forgotten that I was even on the phone.
‚ÄúWho ya talking to Dev? Can I say hi?‚Äù And then he smiled.
Honestly it wasn‚Äôt a smile anymore, no, not really.The skin was gone, but the muscle still knew the shape. His lips had been stripped away, so the grin looked wider, stretched cruelly across the exposed fat and teeth. And his face was raw and stringy like the flesh of a mango that had been freshly peeled.
‚ÄúHe knows I‚Äôm on the phone. Please just send someone. I think he wants to hurt me but I won‚Äôt let him in. I don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs him anymore.‚Äù My words were shaky and my voice low. I tried to whisper so softly directly into the phone that not even I could really hear it.
‚ÄúOkay just stay calm and quiet, I‚Äôm sending someone now, you‚Äôre going to be ok. Are you somewhere safe right now? Do you have something to protect yourself?‚Äù She spoke clear and calmly, the only sturdy thing in this entire situation. 
‚ÄúDev. Don‚Äôt make me freeze out here. Please.‚Äù I could still hear his smile in his voice and that he still stood just inches from the door. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm by the front door, I‚Äôm just sitting here so I can watch him from the peephole. I‚Äôm too scared that if I leave he‚Äôll find a way in.. but I can grab a weapon or something.‚Äù We did have any weapons, we barely had silverwear. The only thing I could find as I rummaged through the kitchen was a disappointingly small steak knife. It would have to do. ‚ÄúI uh, found something, I have a knife now.‚Äù I paused for a second as I went to return back to the front door to keep watch, the microwave and the green glow of the time made me freeze. 10 P.M. It had already been three hours of him sitting outside. It only felt like a few minutes and an eternity combined so I guess that does even out to about three hours, but it still didn‚Äôt make sense how fast time had moved. I kept walking. 
‚ÄúCan you try to find somewhere safer? Do you have a room you can get into that he can‚Äôt get into? Or somewhere you can barricade yourself into? The police are going to be there soon. Any minute.‚Äù She spoke more urgently now but still calm, she was trying to stay calm for me. But there was worry behind her voice. 
My mind flashed to the small safe room that we had set up when we first moved in, he knew the passcode when he helped me set it up, but I don't think this is him anymore. But that should be a last resort, ‚ÄúNo I can just stay here, I don‚Äôt think he can get in.‚Äù
‚ÄúHey Dev, this glass looks really thin. I wouldn‚Äôt want us both to be cold but if you keep acting so weird I might have to find my own way in.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt hear the smile this time, and his voice sounded different, more scratchy and strained. 
She was right, without  another thought I quietly ran upstairs making sure to skip the creaky step on my way up. Every movement I made no matter how far I was from that door I still felt like I needed to be silent. He could barely talk but I somehow knew that he‚Äôd hear me if I made one mistake. He‚Äôd know that I was hiding, he‚Äôd know where I was hiding. I pushed the wardrobe aside to unveil the open room we had behind it before pulling it back behind me. Both of us were nuts, we knew we were. We‚Äôd always ask each other why we‚Äôd need a secret safe room, but we still always wanted peace of mind. I needed it today, just felt weird being in here without him. A few minutes passed, my heart seemed to calm and I felt genuinely safe. That wasn‚Äôt him out there, he couldn‚Äôt know where I am. Besides, the police are about to take care of it. How are they even going to take care of it? His- his skin was falling off like melted rubber. Can he even be saved? Can I?
‚ÄúHey are you still there?‚Äù the operator‚Äôs voice snapped through the phone, crisp and too loud in the stillness. She spooked me. ‚ÄúStay with me. I‚Äôve got two units almost on your street. You should see their lights any second now. Just stay in there ‚Äù
I held my breath, straining. For the first time all night, I heard something besides Blake‚Äôs faint breathing through the door. The sirens blared through the street, it felt wrong how loud they were through the completely quiet street. Even so, even through the sirens, even all the way up here behind this wardrobe, I felt like I could still hear his breathing. It was directly in my ear. Like he was breathing right through into my soul as it whispered its way up my spine. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here,‚Äù I whispered.
She whispered back in the same second like she was anticipating those words, ‚ÄúGood, just stay hidden. They are going to take care of this, just let them handle this.‚Äù 
Her words seemed like the only ones I should follow, but I couldn‚Äôt. What if they came to the front and I wasn‚Äôt there.. if Blake tried something while I sat in a closet doing nothing- no. I had to see it. I pushed the wardrobe aside as quietly as I could and crept down the stairs, every step fighting against the scream in my bones telling me to stay put. Then my body screamed even louder as I forgot about the creaky stair, it squealed as I squished it under my foot. The sirens squealed louder so I kept walking. The dispatcher kept talking, asking me to just stay put and stay safe, almost begging me knowing that something more than I could handle stood outside. She didn‚Äôt know what monstrosity waited for her officers. I didn‚Äôt even know. 
Looking through the peephole felt like watching a snuff film, something I would‚Äôve seen in middle school, part of the reason I was so paranoid for sure. Blake was still facing the door and as soon as I had a chance to see him his blank stare turned into a smile again. Tires crunching over snow. Doors slamming shut. Heavy boots. 
‚ÄúWelcome back Dev! Just couldn‚Äôt stay away?‚Äù He spoke with joy in his voice like he was excited to know I was back. How did he know I was back?
Their voices sounded like an oasis in the midst of a desert. ‚ÄúSir, step away from the door and put your hands where I can see them!‚Äù The authority behind his voice made me quiver. Blake didn‚Äôt flinch. I could imagine it, the scalding heat blistering my back, the sand burning my feet numb to the pain and the taste of bare flesh as my tongue begged for water. I was stuck in the desert.. and I saw no oasis. It was a mirage. 
Blake gave me one last smirk with his skinless lips and bare face. More skin had fallen off, now his arms were missing patches and his shirt was blood soaked. He turned around toward the officers with his hands comfortably above his head. The officer behind the first nearly dropped his gun at the sight of him. I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight but I couldn‚Äôt look away either. The other officer staggered, frozen, weapon shaking in his hands as he stared at Blake, who only grinned with his raw muscle and teeth. I heard his partner scream next as I was made to watch him put the gun to his head. As soon as the other officers' light met Blake he froze. Blake smiled, I could feel that fucking smile even though he was turned away from me. I could even see the muscles around the sides of his face contort to make a grin. 
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening Devin? Are you ok?‚Äù The dispatcher tried to interrupt but nothing could take my attention away. 
His hands met his throat and he clawed again, opening his thick exposed veins to the open air. Blood slowly came out in globs like a thick chocolate pudding, like it had curdled and creamed through the night into something just as sickly sweet as it was sticky and revolting. The officer was silent and unable to move an inch. Until he too raised his gun like he had seen more than his mind would let him. He pulled the trigger too, like his body didn‚Äôt want the trauma of life after this. Both bodies laid on the ground flat like two dolls that a child played with too roughly. Their open wounds painted the street and their blood filled the snow like the syrup to a snowcone. And Blake stood still, and I could only guess still smiling. 
The dispatcher spoke louder now basically yelling, I had only now noticed she was talking to me this entire time just waiting for a response, ‚ÄúDevin! Are you ok? What‚Äôs happening? Where are the officers? Where is the man?‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt respond to her words, I couldn‚Äôt even attempt to move my hand back up to my ear. 
Blake turned around slowly and deliberately. His face didn‚Äôt move. Why the fuck is he still smiling? What is wrong with him? Why me? Why me? Why? He was almost fully raw now. The thin layer of skin that remained scattered around his body like an unfinished puzzle curled and pulled away from the meat that still held on to the bone like he was trying to shed- shed every last piece of him that still clung on. Like he wanted to return to an empty canvas and repaint his face the way he now chose it to be‚Äî Breathe. Just breathe.
The silence was nonexistent. Filled with my quick deep breaths nearly suffocating to the amount of oxygen I took in. His controlled slow breaths matched a slower tempo to mine. Every three breaths I gave he shared one with me in unison. Like he was timing his breathing to match mine, his mouth had to be  nearly against the door with how loud it was. It sounded like a whirlwind whipped around the street, it was just his struggling lungs giving out raspy breaths. 
‚ÄúHey Dev? I‚Äôm kinda cold out here. Can you let me in? I‚Äôm almost ready for you. I just want a little bit of your skin.‚Äù My eye was still glued to the peephole as he walked closer. ‚ÄúJust a little bit, you can share, right?‚Äù 
The dispatcher's words caught me again as I finally got the strength back to pull the phone back in. ‚ÄúDevin I need you to tell me are the officers ok? What is happening?‚Äù 
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre dead. He didn‚Äôt even kill them. They just saw him and- I don‚Äôt know what to do.‚Äù I tried to calm myself as I spoke to her. If he wanted to break in he would‚Äôve by now. He wants permission.
There was a pause on the phone call for an uncomfortably long time, ‚ÄúDevin what does he want? Has he asked you for anything?‚Äù She sounded so disappointed in the way she spoke. 
I tried to talk more quietly than I ever had, I just didn‚Äôt want him to know I was still on the phone with her, that she could still send more help. I whispered,‚ÄùI-I know it sounds crazy but.. he‚Äôs asking for my skin‚Äù
She let out a sigh, not one of relief but of sorrow and grief, like she knew I had no hope. She said back stoic and calm,‚ÄùI‚Äôm sorry. God help you.‚Äù The three hang up beeps haunted me, she didn‚Äôt even give me a second thought. 
‚ÄúHey Dev, you know.. I know you were up in our safe room. I can come up behind the wardrobe if you want, we can hide there until sunrise so you won‚Äôt be scared anymore.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt give me a moment to grieve the death of the only hope I had. My pulse scrambled out of rhythm, I pressed my hand against my mouth to hold in a sound I didn‚Äôt even realize was clawing its way out of me. He knew. He fucking knew. How the fuck does he know? That isn‚Äôt him.. that can‚Äôt be. Or is it? Did he catch something? Is he turning into a fucking werewolf? I squeezed my eyes shut until stars burst in the dark and forced myself to breathe slow, steady, quiet. One in, one out. He wasn‚Äôt in the house. Not yet. I repeated it to myself like a prayer, a spell, anything to keep my hands from shaking the knife right out of my grip. 
He still breathed directly into the door, I was just happy I wasn‚Äôt looking through the peephole anymore, I didn‚Äôt want to see what he had become. How far could this go?
‚ÄúOr you could just give me a little bit. I‚Äôm not asking for much, you just look so damn warm.‚Äù He began to beg almost, he didn‚Äôt sound like he was demanding it, just asking and pleading. 
‚ÄúGo the fuck away Blake! Just go the fuck away!‚Äù I screamed it at him. I screamed so loud it felt like I tore up my vocal cords. 
He took in a big sigh, he sounded disappointed like he expected me to greet him with open arms. We‚Äôve never been that close, not in a long time and definitely not tonight. He coughed and then spoke so clearly,‚ÄùMaybe you‚Äôre right Dev. I'll try to find somewhere else to get warm.‚Äù I could feel him pause after he spoke, waiting for me to call out to him, to beg him to stay. No, I stayed silent, not a word slipped from my mouth. He gave one last breath before I heard the snow crunching away. I watched the clock on the microwave from the door as I sat still frozen for the next two hours but it felt like it still wasn‚Äôt enough time. I couldn‚Äôt move, how could I? 
The green clock on the microwave blinked at me every few minutes to remind me I was still trapped in this grey-scaped purgatory. The minutes felt like hours and the hours like days but I didn‚Äôt move. I couldn‚Äôt. 
He‚Äôs gone. I heard him. 
Still the crunch of the snow was like a fleeting memory. So cemented in my mind but more as the same feeling of a dream after you wake up than a factual moment I had lived. It just didn‚Äôt feel true. 
It couldn‚Äôt be that easy.
The silence and the weight to the air knitted themselves into a blanket and wrapped my world in a thin blanket that couldn‚Äôt be as warm as it seemed. It couldn‚Äôt be. The house groaned with the wind, every sound had intent, a heavy weight that drove a wedge between me and my own peace. I caught myself holding my breath so long my chest ached, but I didn‚Äôt dare let the silence grow without me in it. Wilbur had taken to pacing in the kitchen, claws tapping against the tile in nervous little bursts. He‚Äôd stop, sit, stare at the back hallway like he expected someone to walk in. Then he‚Äôd dart away again, tail stiff, fur prickled along his back. I clutched the steak knife tighter, and the handle sweated with me. My palm stuck to it, tacky, slippery in the same second. It felt more like a toy than a weapon. Every time I adjusted my grip, the blade caught the green glow of the microwave, flashing at me, reminding me how thin it was. A useless thing.
My mind went numb to the time, still I heard every noise that passed by my ear but the minutes finally flew through my night. I blinked. No, fell  asleep. I must‚Äôve. I looked back up at the green glow as my eyes shot open, 6:38 A.M.. 
The house was lighter now, faint blue seeping through the curtains, but the weight of night hadn‚Äôt lifted. It only shifted, thinner, stretched out, easier to see through but still there. The silence wasn‚Äôt gone, only different. A colder silence. One that watched instead of smothered. My whole body buzzed like I‚Äôd been holding my breath the entire time, but my chest rose and fell too fast for that to be true. I wiped at my eyes with the heel of my hand, forcing them to stay open, to focus. Wilbur hadn‚Äôt moved from the kitchen. His back was to me, his fur puffed up into a shape I barely recognized, tail twitching like a clock hand out of rhythm. He hissed suddenly, sharp and wet, the sound slicing through the stillness like glass snapping in my ears. He wasn‚Äôt looking at the front door anymore. His eyes locked on the back hallway.
I turned toward the hallway but my body tried to fight me like it knew better. My steps stuck to the floorboards, each one slow and reluctant. The house itself didn‚Äôt want me to move forward. Wilbur‚Äôs ears flattened as his eyes tracked something I couldn‚Äôt see. I followed his gaze into the shadows stretching past the kitchen, past the laundry room, toward the back door. The light outside barely touched it but I could still see the frost spiderwebbing across the glass. All the hair on the back of his neck down to the base of his spine rose. 
I felt my bones try to jump out of my own body when a mouse scurried out from the trashcan that sat by the door. Wilbur leaped and pounced onto it, taking its life as soon as it believed itself to be safe. Cruel but deserved. The mouse had no way to fight and no where to run. It was doomed as soon as Wilbur decided it was his prey for the night. Hunters are made to hunt. Prey are made to be preyed upon. I was prey. 
The back door this time  knocked for three times once more before I heard that all too familiar smiling voice. 
‚ÄúGoodmorning Devin. I‚Äôve been patient, and it‚Äôs still cold. I might just have to take it from you if you won‚Äôt let me.‚Äù 
6:42 A.M.

To the house where I thought we'd grow old

How you hummed and grinned while reading.  
The light grows thin at four.

That morning when you said goodbye.  
A blackbird breaks the spell.  
Leaves tumble from an empty sky.  
My heart, empty as well.

I literally got offered THREE different ‚Äútesting gateway‚Äù invites this week. Is this a fever dream or do tech companies seriously need that many humans to smash cartoon traffic lights and fluffy dogs behind blurry lines? ü§Ø

So I did some digging (read: a rabbit hole of skepticism, horror, and, yes, MORE captchas). 

Here's what blew my mind to bits:

- **There ARE legit companies that farm testers to weed out bots. But 95% of these get-rich-quick ‚ÄúApp Testing Gateway‚Äù sites are‚Ä¶ not what they seem.**
- You get endless loops: complete a captcha, get redirected, fill out another ‚Äúsurvey,‚Äù rinse, repeat until your soul leaves your body. Actual payouts? Not so much.
- If you click **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and end up in some digital purgatory clicking street signs for hours, BEEN THERE.
- Some users have been PAID ‚Äî as in, a real $1 here, $2 there (!!) ‚Äî for hundreds of hours of test time. That‚Äôs Monopoly money if you compare it to minimum wage.

So WHY is everyone freaking out about these gateways? I nearly spit my coffee out seeing TikToks hyping them up! But wait, here‚Äôs what happens behind the curtain:

- Sites like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** let companies test app security, but they dangle payouts like a carrot on a stick.
- The vast, vast majority of your effort gets recycled back into ‚Äútesting the test.‚Äù
- Some gatekeepers hype ‚ÄúPending Balance?‚Äù newsflash: That $$ almost never hits your account.

Actual, serious moments of confusion:

- What are ‚Äúpayout thresholds?‚Äù Translation: You test until you drop, only to find you need $50 before you can withdraw‚Äîand you‚Äôre only at $3.41, post-migraine.
- Where even ARE these companies based? Whois results are a cosmic riddle written in hieroglyphics.

But yo, not all hope is lost. Here‚Äôs how to dodge the sketchy stuff:

- If you want to try app testing, start at links like **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** but STOP if you find yourself stuck in a captcha matrix.
- Watch out for hidden requests: banking info, social security, or ‚Äúdirect payments‚Äù to sketchy PayPal addresses? HARD PASS.
- Pro tip: Check Reddit or forums to spot red flags about any payout history. If nobody can cash out? It‚Äôs a scam-a-thon.

I‚Äôm honestly SHOCKED at how many people jump in without a second thought. The promise is always ‚Äúclick here, get RICH,‚Äù but reality? 

‚ÄúClick here, be slightly less bored, maybe. But probably just more confused.‚Äù

Did you ever actually get paid? Am I missing the secret hack, or just stuck on level 9001 of Captcha-geddon?

If you‚Äôre braver than me, try **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** ‚Äî but I wanna hear what actually happened! (And if you get past two whole paywalls, I‚Äôll owe you a donut.)

Hi all! I‚Äôve been testing coffee cakes up here in high altitude (5,000‚Äì7,000 ft), and I finally landed on a version that comes out moist and fluffy instead of dry and dense. Thought I‚Äôd share in case anyone else is baking above the clouds üåÑ.

# Ingredients

**Cake:**

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* ¬Ω tsp baking soda
* ¬Ω tsp salt
* ¬Ω cup unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup sugar
* 2 large eggs, room temp
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup sour cream (or plain Greek yogurt)

**Streusel Topping:**

* ¬Ω cup brown sugar
* 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 4 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
* ¬æ cup all-purpose flour
* Pinch of salt

# Adjustments for High Altitude (5,000‚Äì7,000 ft)

* Reduce sugar slightly in the cake (by \~2 Tbsp).
* Add 1 extra Tbsp flour to the cake batter.
* Bake at **375¬∞F instead of 350¬∞F** to set structure quicker.
* Start checking at 32‚Äì35 minutes (instead of 40).

# Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375¬∞F. Grease a 9√ó9 pan or line with parchment.
2. Make the streusel: mix sugars, cinnamon, salt; stir in butter; fold in flour until crumbly.
3. Whisk dry cake ingredients in one bowl. In another, cream butter + sugar until fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, then vanilla.
4. Mix in dry ingredients alternately with sour cream, ending with dry. Batter will be thick.
5. Spread half the batter into pan, sprinkle with ‚Öì of streusel. Add remaining batter, then the rest of the streusel on top.
6. Bake 32‚Äì38 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean. Cool 15 min before slicing.

Comes out tender, not dry, with that crunchy cinnamon topping. Perfect with coffee at altitude ‚òï‚ú®.

üëâ Want me to also make a **shorter comment-friendly version** (just the high-altitude tweaks + quick directions) you can drop if someone‚Äôs asking for adjustments in a thread?

**High Altitude Cinnamon Streusel Coffee Cake (Quick Version)**

* For 5,000‚Äì7,000 ft:
   * Reduce sugar in the cake batter by \~2 Tbsp
   * Add +1 Tbsp flour to batter
   * Bake at **375¬∞F instead of 350¬∞F**
   * Check doneness at 32‚Äì35 min

**Basic Method:**

* Cream ¬Ω cup butter + 1 cup sugar, add 2 eggs + vanilla
* Mix in 2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking powder, ¬Ω tsp baking soda, ¬Ω tsp salt, and 1 cup sour cream (alternating wet/dry)

1ncyg9r,https://i.redd.it/e2refgjc38of1.jpeg,WO Slot Structure & Promotion Outlook,"Not sure if I'm breaking some dark warrant brotherhood OPSEC rule, but I'm in a bit of a career crossroads. My reenlistment window opens up in a month, and I‚Äôm between reclassing to 17E and going EW Tech (170B) after meeting time requirements or staying in Chemical for 740A. 

Part of my thinking is that I would like to do time on the trail before switching over to warrant. If I stayed Chemical, I‚Äôd probably volunteer soon since DS time counts as career development for 740A. On the other hand, 170B requires 36 months in the MOS performing EW duties, which makes it harder to fit both drill time and EW time in before I hit 12 years. I‚Äôm currently 6 years in.

What I‚Äôd really like to know is whether there‚Äôs a way to see what jobs the Army currently needs more slots filled in. Based on the USAREC site, 170B has a clear structure: WO1/CW2 at BDE, CW3 at DIV, CW4 at Corps, and CW5 at EAC. For 740A, the picture isn‚Äôt as clear. Based on the in/out calls right now, I‚Äôd assume 17 CMF might offer faster promotions, but I‚Äôm not sure how that reflects on the warrant side. For someone aiming at a 20+ year career, which path actually has better promotion prospects and career stability? 

Also, how much control do WOs realistically get over their assignments? My wife‚Äôs job prefers her to stay in the Southeastern U.S. Would it be realistic to bounce around Campbell (101st), Stewart (3rd ID), and Bragg (82nd, 18th ABN, FORSCOM) and still progress?

Not asking for OPSEC-sensitive info. Just trying to gauge what would be the better option for me.

1ncyeqa,https://i.redd.it/la076mcv28of1.jpeg,"The Story of Pawn and Pint: Past, Present and Future","I‚Äôm willing to bet some of you have been to Pawn and Pint before, which means we‚Äôve likely met. Hello again! I‚Äôm the both new and former General Manager at Pawn and Pint. In respect for the r/kansascity rules I'm not going to include any names throughout this post, but if you‚Äôd humor me for a short read, I‚Äôd like to share with you a story; The story of Kansas City‚Äôs first board game tavern, Pawn and Pint, and tell you of it‚Äôs past, it‚Äôs present, and it‚Äôs future.  
  
Firstly, what this story is and what this story isn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not here to gossip or spill the tea. I‚Äôm not here to name names or cast blames. I‚Äôm not here to give you a shocking reveal or a surprise twist, although I find the story surprising in its own ways. No, what I‚Äôm here to do is tell you about the winding road that brought Pawn and Pint to Kansas City, and the decade I‚Äôve followed it since then.  
  
I bet many of you have questions about what exactly happened to Pawn and Pint over the last ten years and what‚Äôs going on there now, and while I surely won‚Äôt answer all of your questions, let me at least start the story at its beginning.  
  
Our story begins in May 2016, when my dear friend kicked in the door to my Dungeons and Dragons game night while holding a box of home made t-shirts. He proudly declared that he had quit his teaching job, that he was going to live out of his car, and by Fall he would open Kansas City‚Äôs first ever board game tavern, Pawn and Pint! To some of us, that might sound rather reckless or even foolish, but let me ask you, who is more foolish; The fool, or the one who follows him? Well, I followed him.  
  
In October 2016, my friend opened Pawn and Pint in the Crossroads with a hundred thrifted and borrowed board games, a cooler of Pepsi and a vision for something crazy and awesome. I watched him put in 70 hour plus work weeks as he poured his heart and soul into this idea, and I was inspired to do the same. By May 2017, I had quit my day job and was working full time alongside him, keeping ridiculous hours and helping building our community in my role as Pawn and Pint‚Äôs first General Manager.  
  
By October 2017 we opened our Walnut St. location, where Pawn still stands open today. If you haven‚Äôt seen it yet, I encourage you to do so, it really is a sight to see! I‚Äôm particularly fond of our mezzanine. To make a long story short, Pawn picked up some investors in those early days, and we all worked very hard together to make Pawn and Pint thrive!  
  
Throughout 2018 and 2019, Pawn soared to wonderful heights. Those were some glory days for our gaming community. Over a thousand games in the collection, multiple events nightly, joining local conventions, and supporting KC charities. We were in our prime and it showed. At the same time, however, ownership had some conflicting views about the best path forward for the company.  
  
Like I already told you, I‚Äôm not going to go naming names or blaming blames. All I‚Äôll say is, throughout late 2019 the owners of Pawn were divided on the best way to grow the tavern, and when this conflict was coming to a head, a far great problem emerged. By March 2020, We found ourselves no longer worrying about a divide in ownership, but worrying about the very survival of our company and our community! Now there was a global pandemic to worry about.

We watched as dozens of our neighboring businesses began to close their doors, businesses we loved and worked alongside permanently shuttering their operations during an impossible situation. I don‚Äôt need to tell you how many small businesses Kansas City lost during those early days of the pandemic, and Pawn was not exempt from these hardships. Faced with overwhelming impossibilities, we made the hardest decision we ever had; We agreed to share our stake in Pawn and Pint, de facto resolving the ownership conflict, and we found our team homeless and adrift.

The new Pawn ownership team decided to rework the model of the business. To quote the manager who replaced me, ‚ÄúWe are no longer a board game bar, we‚Äôre a bar that just happens to have board games.‚Äù The focus shifted to serving a more general audience. TV‚Äôs went up. Lights came down. Our gamer‚Äôs haven become just another bar in downtown KC. To be honest, it was heartbreaking.  
  
Now in all fairness here, as heartbreaking as this was, I do not blame the then owners of Pawn at all for the decisions they made. They had to do whatever they needed to do to keep the doors open during an unprecedented global pandemic. To their credit, Pawn and Pint still stands today, and while I may not agree with many of the decision made during those days, I am grateful that some form of our original vision survived those terrible times. I am very grateful Pawn still exists now.

I‚Äôm not going to talk about Pawn for a moment, because this is where our paths diverged. When the pandemic began to wain and a return to a somewhat normal life seemed possible, we did what any gamer would do after getting a bad ending in a video game; We restarted from the beginning, with new characters and a better understanding of the challenges we faced. We created a new approach, an updated vision, a path forward. We re-rolled our business, and in this case, literally!  
  
ReRoll Tavern, and it‚Äôs sister bar Vignettes Pop-Up Bar, opened in September of 2021. We were fortunate to bring with us an experienced crew from the old Pawn and Pint, a huge following of loyal and dedicated community members, the knowledge garnered from years of running a board game tavern, and a vision for even bigger and better projects to share with our friends! It was ambitious, and maybe even crazier and more foolish than the original vision for Pawn, but there we were, doing it all over again, and there I was, the fool following the fool once more as ReRoll‚Äôs General Manager.

Our time at ReRoll Tavern was the most difficult and rewarding years of my professional career. Running a small business is challenging even in the best of times, but in a post-covid world, well, it was like playing a favorite game on the hardest difficulty setting imaginable. I think we did well over the four year we ran ReRoll and Vignettes, I‚Äôm proud of what we built and shared, and I‚Äôll gladly share the stories from ReRoll the rest of my life. Ask me about them sometime, I‚Äôm happy to share! But this story is about Pawn and Pint, so we‚Äôd best get back to it.  
  
While ReRoll was growing and struggling, Pawn was fighting to find its own path too. I won‚Äôt pretend to know all of the challenges they faced, or the hard decisions they had to make, or the struggles they had to overcome; I wasn‚Äôt there. And frankly, I was more occupied running my own small business at the time. From 2021 to 2024, all I could really do was occasionally look beyond the river from North KC toward Downtown and wonder how Pawn was holding up. I had always hoped for the best.  
  
By 2025, the world has become a difficult place to maneuver a small business. I don‚Äôt need to tell you all about the rising costs of living, the mass layoffs in our city, you know that story, you‚Äôre living it too. And I won‚Äôt pretend like we ran ReRoll and Vignettes perfectly either, like I‚Äôve said, running a small business is challenging even in the best of times. We did the best we could with what we had, and I‚Äôm extremely proud of that. Regretfully, however, 2025 became ReRoll‚Äôs very own Kobayashi Maru. But remember, this story is about Pawn and Pint, so let‚Äôs continue our story.

Pawn was having a rough go of it as well, and in December of 2024, the owners of Pawn faced their own unwinnable situation. After nine years of operation, the owners of Pawn made the terribly difficult decision to close Pawn and Pint.  
  
Now at this point in the story, you‚Äôd think this is the end book, with Pawn and ReRoll both staring down their own respective falling curtains. But in fact this is where our story really begins, and with a Christmas miracle all our own!

At the tail end of December 2024, right around Christmas, a small group of loyal and dedicated gamers, who knew what Pawn had been in it‚Äôs pre-covid glory days came together, pooled their personal resources, and purchased Pawn and Pint, reforming it under a new company, ‚ÄúFor Gamers LLC‚Äù! While ReRoll was fighting a losing battle throughout early 2025, the new owners at Pawn were just getting started! Bit by bit, month by month, they rebuilt Pawn and Pint, replacing equipment and fixtures, organizing games, repairing the building, renovating the space. Through their hard work and dedication Pawn had been given a new lease on life.

In a bit of coincidental storytelling you‚Äôd think was fiction were it not a hundred percent true, one day in June 2025 ‚ÄúFor Gamers‚Äù held a meeting at Pawn to discuss how to get the freshly refurbished Pawn and Pint up to full speed, like ReRoll Tavern was. Within hours of that meeting ReRoll announced it would be closing at the end of June, which prompted ‚ÄúFor Gamers‚Äù to call a second emergency meeting with a new goal; to bring the ReRoll community and team back Home to Pawn!

In a whirlwind of activity that I could only describe as passing in a blur, I found myself spending my full days winding down ReRoll while simultaneously spending my full nights winding up Pawn! I was privileged to host ReRoll‚Äôs final party on June 30th, and turned right around to host my first event at Pawn and Pint since the pandemic on July 1st! Before I knew it I had gone from being ReRoll‚Äôs outgoing General Manager to Pawn and Pint‚Äôs incoming General Manager‚Ä¶ Again!

This brings our story almost up to the present, and if you‚Äôve read along this long, I am grateful! I‚Äôd ask that you indulge me just a little bit longer.  
  
I‚Äôve spent July 2025 with Pawn‚Äôs new owners and we‚Äôve been rather busy. We just unveiled our new menu and event calendar on August 1st, and we‚Äôve got a kitchen under construction right now to (hopefully!) be opened by this September! What comes next is a Five Phase plan we‚Äôve come up with for the future of Pawn and Pint, and I'd like to invite you to be a part of it!  
  
We‚Äôre in Phase One right now, implementing new programs and welcoming back old friends. Phase Two comes this Fall with a strong focus on optimizing what we‚Äôve started to build and putting in the spit-and-polish. We then come to Phase Three in the Holiday Season, turning our emphasis from growing internally to running and hosting the best holiday events in all of the metro! Phase Four kicks off in the new year, with our ambitions to fully renovate the building during the Spring months. At last then we come to Phase Five in Summer 2026, where we seriously look at opening a day-time coffee shop and cafe program at Pawn and Pint!  
  
There‚Äôs a lot left to share of this story and a lot left to come, so now the only real question is, how would you like to join our story?

You can swing by Pawn and Pint anytime you‚Äôd like. Whether it‚Äôs just once to wish us well, or if you have ambition to be a regular or a member, or if you want to pull me aside and ask more about the story I‚Äôve shared here, you‚Äôre welcome to stop by and be a part of our story!  
  
We used to say at ReRoll, ‚ÄúEvery great adventure begins in a tavern‚Äù. Well, that‚Äôs certainly been true for me. Through these two taverns I‚Äôve made lifelong friends, I unknowingly first met my now wife as a customer, and I‚Äôve been blessed to be in the center of the gaming community here in Kansas City. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better community to be a part of or to be a host for. For ten years now it has been my privilege to know you and to game with you, and if you‚Äôll have me, I‚Äôd like to do so for at least another ten years and more!

Thanks for reading along, I appreciate you all. I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing more of this story with you over a pawn and a pint! But right this moment, if you‚Äôd do me just one kindness, please, hold my beer.

Same. That‚Äôs exactly why more people are switching to **Ryze Mushroom Coffee** ‚Äî and loving it.

Unlike regular coffee that often spikes your energy and wrecks your gut, Ryze delivers a clean, focused lift without the unwanted side effects. It‚Äôs made from organic Arabica coffee blended with six powerful mushrooms like **Lion‚Äôs Mane**, **Chaga**, and **Cordyceps** ‚Äî and no, it doesn‚Äôt taste like mushrooms.

The result? A surprisingly smooth cup that still feels like ‚Äúreal‚Äù coffee ‚Äî only smarter.

**Here‚Äôs what you get in every scoop of Ryze:**

* **Sharper focus and mental clarity** (thank you, Lion‚Äôs Mane)
* **Gentle, long-lasting energy** without the crash
* **Immune system support** thanks to antioxidant-rich mushrooms
* **Lower acidity** ‚Äî your gut will thank you
* **Stress support** from adaptogens that help regulate cortisol

And because it has about half the caffeine of regular coffee, it works *with* your body‚Äôs natural rhythm ‚Äî not against it. You stay sharp, feel grounded, and avoid the afternoon crash that coffee drinkers know all too well.

**Curious about the full list of benefits?**  
üëâ [Read more Benefits of Ryze Mushroom Coffee](https://naturalfoodseries.com/ryze-mushroom-coffee/)

For anyone trying to reduce caffeine, boost brain function, or just feel better without ditching their coffee ritual, Ryze is a no-brainer. It‚Äôs dairy-free, sugar-free, keto-friendly, and easy to mix into hot water ‚Äî no fancy tools required.

So if your current coffee routine leaves you wired, tired, or bloated‚Ä¶ maybe it‚Äôs time to upgrade your mug.

And what shocks me even more than the violence‚Ä¶ is how fucking okay everyone here seems to be with it.**



I‚Äôm a tourist ‚Äî just here for two weeks.

In that short time, here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen with my own eyes:



* I was nearly attacked twice by homeless men ‚Äî once for just accidentally glancing at one, and once on a bus where a guy screamed ‚Äúbitch‚Äù at the air and then picked up a bottle to threaten me.
* I saw a homeless guy throw coffee at a random woman on the street.
* I watched another one scream at every single person walking by, like a rabid animal.
* I saw a couple get physically attacked in front of a supermarket.
* I saw a man **urinate in the middle of a busy intersection** ‚Äî between moving cars ‚Äî in broad daylight.
* I saw a man screaming at a lamppost *next to a children‚Äôs playground*.





That alone would be horrifying enough.

But here‚Äôs what **makes it so much worse** ‚Äî and honestly broke me:





# ü§Ø The public response: absolute apathy disguised as ‚Äúkindness‚Äù





1. I saw a **family of three walking past Church Street**, full of homeless people screaming. The kid was visibly scared. The mother looked at him and said:





>‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs okay.‚Äù



No.



>**It‚Äôs not fucking okay.**

>It‚Äôs not okay that you‚Äôd rather teach your child to tolerate danger than acknowledge it.







1. I saw a homeless man **harassing a group of teenage girls**. When they finally got away, I overheard them nervously say:





>‚ÄúThey usually just do drugs but they won‚Äôt hurt you.‚Äù



What the actual fuck.

**You were just harassed. And now you‚Äôre rationalizing it? Defending it?**

This is what happens in a culture where *survival instincts are gaslit by performative compassion.*





I‚Äôve never seen a society so proudly weak. So fake nice. So scared to say the truth:



>**This isn‚Äôt compassion. This is dysfunction. This is decay.**



And the worst part? The people suffering the most are the ones doing the least harm ‚Äî **children, women, everyday citizens, people just trying to live their lives.**

They‚Äôre the ones hiding indoors, moving to the suburbs, living in fear, while addicts and violent vagrants roam the city center unchecked.





**And no, pepper spray is not legal.**

You can‚Äôt even carry a basic self-defense tool here. But the government will hand out free needles and supervised injection sites like candy ‚Äî and pat themselves on the back for being ‚Äúprogressive.‚Äù



You can‚Äôt make this shit up.





This city is collapsing, and people are still more afraid of being called ‚Äúmean‚Äù than they are of being stabbed.

I‚Äôve seen more public chaos, violence, and neglect in 2 weeks here than in *years* in my own country.



>If this were my country, half of these people **wouldn‚Äôt make it past episode 2.**

>Canada, you are **too nice for your own survival.**

Constantly striving for improvement, I've built a rather happy life for myself. Always looking for new goals, trying new ways of being healthier, and I LOVE learning and strive to always challenge my beliefs. I enjoy my career (I work as an operator in the chemical manufacturing industry), It provides a good living (which was lacking for most of my life lol) and it gives me an ample amount of time to stay in touch with you throughout the day if you're the type.¬†¬†

Long distance relationships don't bother me too much (US only), ideally after a set amount of time we both feel like it's appropriate we would move in together and start that journey (relocation to me is ideal).¬†

I have a lot of interests ranging from gaming to binging watching some of my favorite shows; moral of the story is escapism is one of my favorite past times. I \*love\* running, go to the gym regularly, playing with my pit/lab mix dog named Strider (LOTR reference), a frequent flyer so i love to travel and reading (on a bit of a history theme lately). I love LOVE coffee, hanging with my friends, going to music festivals, and trying new restaurants. As you can tell, I'm a bit of a nerd so fantasy being a huge thing for me ranging from Lord of the Rings movies to the annual Harry Potter marathon around the holidays and everything in between. I do visit my local renaissance fair and try to plan a costume so it would be cool if we could bond that way!

I like small things in relationships that include weekend cuddles (obsessed), evening coffee shop reading dates, lazy mornings, random road trips and hitting the gym together! Maybe we're holding hands at the farmers market looking for dinner ingredients, snuggling in a hammock on a beautiful summer day, or riding bikes/running together. Putting on your playlist in the car cause chances are you're in charge of it xD, you sneaking kisses on my cheek while I'm playing games with my friends, dressing in our A+ outfits and getting lost in time on our date...I'm rambling too much but you get the gist.¬†¬†

I think fundamentally, even if we don't share the same hobbies, having the same goals and future outlook is most important. I'm very inquisitive so I tend to ask a lot of questions, I don't mind calling whenever you're comfortable because conversations typically flow better that way for me.¬†¬†

I'll probably only respond if your open to sharing a pic within the first message or two so we can see if the attraction is mutual, i do have preferences for partners who have a thin/petite build or lean towards the athletic/fit side!

Mon and tues are in office while the other days are at home. Not too bad, however, my commute is 6 hours round trip. 45 mins (closer to 55) in the car driving to the train, 1.5 on the train, and a 30 min walk to the office after (instead of taking the subway, this keeps me sane lol).

I wake up at 4:15 on days I go in person. By 1-2 pm I‚Äôm ready to go to sleep. I‚Äôm so exhausted and the brain fog is unbearable. It‚Äôs hard for me to produce quality work and stay on track basically after my lunch break and until I pack up and go home. 

My job is very much sedentary. I used to wake up at 3 when I worked my old job that had the same commute and going in 5x a week (insane). This would help me a little bit I think, because I‚Äôd have some fresh air and probably a dopamine increase from exercise, but now I use to the two days I‚Äôm in person as rest days to get as much sleep as possible lol. 

Currently, I try to get up and stand or take a walk to the rest room when I find the brain fog hitting. I‚Äôve also resorted to a second coffee (I have my first at 9 and second around 2 usually) after my lunch, but it doesn‚Äôt do anything to me‚Ä¶ any tips to increase my productivity despite being sooo tired?

1ncxwy5,https://i.redd.it/9raco6a8x7of1.png,I made a Scrap Gold Calculator in honor of my grandfather.,"Hello everyone,

My name is Rodney, and I‚Äôve been collecting gold and silver for over 15 years. My grandfather was a watchmaker for 60 years, and earlier this year he passed away. Every morning he would ask for the gold price‚Äîfirst by calling New York for the daily quote, and later, after he learned I could check on my iPhone, he‚Äôd call and ask me to look it up. That routine meant a lot to us and inspired me to build something of my own.

This project is dedicated to him. I developed a **free online Scrap Gold and Silver Calculator** to help collectors and enthusiasts quickly estimate value. I‚Äôll keep improving it, including features like tracking your collection‚Äôs total worth.

‚ÄúHello, Ivan,‚Äù he said, after I walked into the apartment after work.

‚ÄúHi Richard,‚Äù I said. Then I realized what had just happened, though, and I dropped my laptop on the floor. ‚ÄúDid you just talk?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is that possible?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure.‚Äù

Richard and I sat on the couch and tried to figure out what had happened. I‚Äôd recently returned from a work trip to Cairo. While walking through Khan el-Khalili bazaar, a wooden statue caught my attention. The statue was a foot tall and depicted a mummified man standing with his arms crossed over his chest. The wood felt unexpectedly heavy in my hands, almost warm despite the cool air. The detail in the man's face was incredible. I could even see the small wrinkles around his eyes. He almost looked real.

I asked the vendor how much the statue cost. I worried he‚Äôd say hundreds, but when told me he only wanted twenty U.S. dollars, I bought the statue and took it home as a souvenir. I put it on my TV stand, next to my TV.   

‚ÄúI‚Äôve felt strange ever since you brought the statue home,‚Äù Richard said. 

‚ÄúDo you think it has something to do with why you can talk now?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had thoughts but when you brought this statue home, I started thinking in English. I‚Äôve never thought in English before. I never wanted to speak, either, but now I do.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe person who sold me the statue said it was an Ushebti statue. He said they‚Äôre usually found in tombs, but this statue had been carved by a local. It was art, not a piece of history.‚Äù

I picked up the statue and looked at it more closely. The wood felt oily. I noticed tiny cracks running the wood, too, like veins, and layers of light and dark red coloring that shifted in the light. Maybe the statue was much older than I‚Äôd thought it was.

It took a while for me to get used to Richard being able to talk, but once I got over the shock of it, I enjoyed our conversations. I didn‚Äôt have any friends. Usually, after work, I‚Äôd just go home and play videos games or watch TV. I still did that, but now I had someone else to talk to. Richard would ask me all kinds of questions about the world, and I‚Äôd do my best to answer him.

‚ÄúWhy do dogs hate us so much?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never really thought about it. I guess they just do.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if I eat this pizza, I‚Äôll get sick?‚Äù

‚ÄúYour stomach wasn‚Äôt made for it. Cats need to eat raw meat.‚Äù

At first, Richard seemed happy to spend time with me, too. As the weeks went on, though, he became irritated by my behavior, and he started criticizing me.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we go out for a walk?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired. I don‚Äôt feel like walking.

‚ÄúEvery day you come home, and you sit on the couch. You never do anything. You‚Äôre so lazy.‚Äù
Another time, I ordered pizza two nights in a row, and Richard gave me a look of pure disgust. 

‚ÄúHow can you eat like this?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like cooking.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen order a salad. Order anything healthy for once.‚Äù

I began to resent Richard. I went out of my way to avoid him. Instead of coming home after work, I took his advice and started going to the gym. I lost nearly twenty pounds.

Richard started going out more, too. Each morning, before I left for work, he‚Äôd ask me to open the window. He‚Äôd spend the day exploring Chicago, not coming home until much later that night. Sometimes not until the next day.  

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúLearning about the world,‚Äù he said.

The way he was acting made me feel uncomfortable. I don‚Äôt know exactly what it was. If it was how he talked, or how he reacted to me. He didn‚Äôt just seem resentful anymore. He seemed hateful. He seemed like he wanted to hurt me and hurt other people in the world, too. It was like he felt better than all of us, and the rest of us needed to be brought up to his standards.

In my free time, I started to research Ushebti statues. I learned that the Ushebti were magical servant statues buried with the dead. They awaken in the afterlife and perform work on behalf of the deceased, stepping in like their clone.

I tried talking to Richard about what the statue might be doing to him, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. He just mocked me.

‚ÄúYou think this statue has somehow possessed me?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúCats don‚Äôt just start talking. Something is going on.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever think maybe I‚Äôm just smarter than other cats?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre talking, Richard. You‚Äôre reading Plato and Aristotle and Livy‚Äôs History of Rome. That‚Äôs not normal.‚Äù

I decided to try an experiment. One night, while Richard was gone, I took the statue down to my car. When Richard came home later that night, he was furious. He immediately woke me up, jumping on my bed and hissing my face.

‚ÄúWhere is it?‚Äù he yelled.

‚ÄúI threw it out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen go get it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOr what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll make you regret it.‚Äù

He‚Äôd never threatened me before. I‚Äôd believe his threat, too. He‚Äôd do whatever he could to hurt me.

I got the statue from my car and put it back beside my TV again. From then on, though, I kept my distance from Richard. Truthfully, I was scared of him. I had no idea what he was capable of.

‚ÄúThe people in this city are so boring,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúEvery day, I‚Äôve been watching them do the same things, again and again. No ambition, no dreams, nothing. Just millions of people, wasting away, wasting their lives.‚Äù

I‚Äôd finally had enough of him. ‚ÄúAnd what are you doing with your life?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúIf ambition is so important to you, maybe you should go live somewhere else.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you kicking me out?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we‚Äôd both be happier if you didn‚Äôt live together anymore.‚Äù

Richard agreed.

I offered to help him move. Wherever he wanted to go, I‚Äôd find a way to get him there. He thanked me, but then he asked for some time to think about what he wanted to do next.

It was that same night, the nightmares started.

I dreamt I was lying in my bed when two, rotten arms reached up through my bedsheets and dragged me downward, through the bed and into an ocean of black water.

I flailed my limbs, struggling to breath, as I sank deeper and deeper.

I sensed other things around me, watching me. Not people. Something else. Sprits. Demons.

Their yellows eyes lit up the darkness.

I woke in my bed, covered in cold sweat, my heart beating painfully fast. Richard sat at the edge of my bed, watching me with the same yellow eyes.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing here?‚Äù I asked him.

‚ÄúI heard you scream. I came to make sure you were okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt fine, though. I was even more frightened than before. I was desperate for help, too. What if whatever had taken a control of Richard‚Äôs mind really wanted control of me?

During my research into the Ushebti statue, I came across the profile of a professor of at the University of Chicago, Dr. Sarah Chen, an expert in Egyptology. I reached out to her by email, explaining what happened and attaching a video of Richard talking to me.

Dr. Chen agreed to meet me for coffee on the university campus. She arrived at the caf√© with her hair tied in a ponytail, her eyes very visibly strained, and her hands smeared with blue ink.

‚ÄúYou swear that video is real?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt AI or photoshop or something like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs 100% real. My cat can talk. He‚Äôs been talking to me ever since I brought that statue home. His behavior has changed, too. At first, he was kind friendly. Now, though, he acts like he wants me dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf what you say is true, I believe the Ushebti statue you brought home from Egypt had a spirit trapped inside of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúA spirit?‚Äù

She nods. ‚ÄúWealthy people were buried with hundreds of these statues. The dead person‚Äôs spirit was supposed to bring these statues to life to perform work on their behalf. Maybe that‚Äôs what happened. Whoever was buried with that statue, their soul has awakened it to accomplish something here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would this spirit want?‚Äù

‚ÄúPower and wealth, possibly. Religious favor. Legacy and memory.‚Äù She sipped her coffee and thought for a moment. ‚ÄúIf the statue has caused this problem, though, maybe destroying this statue would fix it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do I destroy it?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not really my area of expertise, but if I were you, I would burn it. Don‚Äôt put out the fire until every bit of the statue has turned to ash.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre sure that would help?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but I don‚Äôt know what else you can do.‚Äù

On my way home from the university, I stopped at store and bought an axe, a lighter, and some lighter fluid. I hid everything in the trunk of car, so Richard wouldn‚Äôt see it.

At home, Richard sat in the windowsill in the living room, flicking his tail. He seemed to know something was wrong.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you go to work today?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt feeling well.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why didn‚Äôt you stay home?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a few errands to run. It was just a fever.‚Äù

I tried walking to my room, but Richard jumped in front of me.

‚ÄúYou smell different. Someone‚Äôs perfume. Who were you talking to?‚Äù

‚ÄúNobody. Just a few cashiers. Maybe it‚Äôs one of their perfumes you‚Äôre smelling.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù

I walked around him, sat on my bed, and turned on my bedroom TV. Every now then, I‚Äôd look at the door. I could see Richard paws moving as he paced back and forth.

‚ÄúAre you staying home tonight, too?‚Äù I asked him

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a little cold tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you thought anymore about where you‚Äôd like to live next?‚Äù

‚ÄúI have a few ideas. I‚Äôll let you know soon.‚Äù

Later, I opened my door a crack. I didn‚Äôt seem him. I hoped he was sleeping.

I tiptoed towards the TV and then picked up the Ushebti statue.

Richard lunged at me, hissing. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch it!‚Äù

His claws dug into my face, ripping the skin. I grabbed onto him and threw him back onto the couch. Then I picked up the statue and ran out of my apartment, slamming the door shut behind me.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll regret this!‚Äù he screamed.

I ran downstairs and got into my car. I could feel the blood dripping down my cheeks. Thank God he hadn‚Äôt clawed my eyes.

Where can I burn this statue? I wondered. There‚Äôs on going back now.

I drove around aimlessly for an hour, but then I headed toward Chicago‚Äôs south side and parked in an alleyway next to an empty, graffiti-covered warehouse.

I looked around and didn‚Äôt see anyone else.

I got out of the car and opened the trunk.

In the distance, someone screamed, and I spun around. I was still alone, though. Nothing but buildings and shadows. The smoke from the smokestacks twisting through the sky.

I took out the axe and the lighter fluid. I swung the axe down on the statue, cutting it in half.  

Lightning flashed across the sky. In the distance, police sirens wailed.

I covered the two broken pieces of the statue with lighter fluid and set them on fire.

As soon as the flames lit up, the silence was ripped apart by a terrible scream. Rain began pouring from the sky.

My hands shook as I covered the flames with my jacket, protecting the flames until they‚Äôd grown large enough that the rain could no longer stop the statue from burning.

I watched as the wood turned to ash and then as the wind blew the ashes away. That awful statue was gone forever.

Please be over, I hoped. Please let Richard be okay.

The rain began falling harder. I got back in my car and drove back home with my windshield wipers squeaking loudly against the glass.

Inside my apartment, all the lights were off.

I turned the lights on. In front of the TV, blood was splattered on the carpet from where Richard had cut me.

Finally, I saw him. He jumped off the couch and meowed.

‚ÄúRichard?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù

He meows again.

I got on my knees. He walked towards me, and I pet his head.

‚ÄúDo you understand what I‚Äôm saying?‚Äù

He sat, purring. I looked at his eyes. His eyes looked less yellow, too.

‚ÄúI love you, Richard,‚Äù I said.

He walked to his water bowl and licked his water.

It was finally over.

I sat on the couch and turned on the TV. Richard jumped on my lap, and I started petting him again while he purred. But then, suddenly, icy fingers grabbed onto my shoulders. Before I could turn to see who it was, I was violently dragged backwards over the couch, my shins slamming into the coffee table. I clawed at the carpet as I was pulled across the floor and into the bedroom.  

‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I screamed.

The bedroom door slammed shut behind me. In the darkness, whatever had grabbed me, threw me onto the bed. Two yellows eyes appeared in front of my face.

‚ÄúYou pathetic little man,‚Äù it hissed.

I pressed its cold hands into my chest. My heart froze. The bed turned to water, and then I began to fall through that same, cold black water again.

‚ÄúLet go of me!‚Äù I yelled, and I tried to fight my way back to the surface before I drowned.

Then I heard Richard scratching at the door, trying to get in. The sound cut through the nightmare. Suddenly I could feel my bed beneath me again. I was gasping, soaked in sweat, but breathing air instead of that horrible water.

I went to the door and opened it. Richard looked up at me and meowed.

The apartment lights began flicker. I picked up Richard and carried him downstairs to my car. I drove around in circles the rest of the night, afraid to go back home.

‚ÄúHave you been back to the apartment?‚Äù Dr. Chen asked me.

‚ÄúRichard and I stayed at a hotel for the next week,‚Äù I said, ‚Äúbut then I started to run out of money, so we went home. Our first night there after what happened was a little frightening, but the apartment seems normal now.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt noticed anything strange?‚Äù

‚ÄúEvery now and then when I‚Äôm sleeping, I‚Äôll wake up to a loud noise, but I think it‚Äôs just my imagination.  Honestly, I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I imagined this whole thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut you have the videos.‚Äù

‚ÄúThose have changed, too. Look at this.‚Äù I take out my phone and play one of the videos for her. Richard looks at the camera and meows. ‚ÄúYou heard him talking before, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI did.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, whatever proof I had is gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd Richard hasn‚Äôt talked since you destroyed the statue?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe hasn‚Äôt said a word.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen destroying the statue must have worked.‚Äù

After saying goodbye to Dr. Chen, I drove home and ordered a pizza for dinner. Richard and I sat together on the couch, watching TV. He looked up at me, and I pet his head.

I‚Äôm happy things are back to normal now. But at night, while Richard sits at the edge of my bed, I can‚Äôt help but wonder what he‚Äôs thinking about, and how much of who he was before is still him. Sometimes, I wish I could get rid of him, but he‚Äôs my cat. He‚Äôs been my cat for seven years.

I can‚Äôt just abandon him.
