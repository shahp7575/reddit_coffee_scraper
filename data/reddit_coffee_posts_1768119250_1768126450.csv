Here's my second attempt. Slightly coarser grind, slightly less full basket, used a tool to remove any clumps. Freshly boiled water, induction stove set to 5 out of 9. The coffee was less sour but still somewhat so. The puck fell apart in three parts (see second photo).",1,1768126357.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

1q9vu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1q9vu2c/my_dog_has_been_hit_by_a_car/,My Dog Has Been Hit By A Car,"Billy had been my best friend since I adopted him as a puppy from the animal shelter. When my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, I had lost everything that had somehow given me stability. My relationship, my apartment, even some of my friends. I was really feeling awful back then, which was why I wanted to get a dog. To help me think about other things again. I fell in love immediately with the little Border Collie who had sat down in front of me at the shelter, looking at me with his head tilted, while lifting one ear and letting the other hang down. The black-and-white fur, the blue eyes, and the distinctive dark stripe of fur running across his snout made him a truly beautiful and unique dog. The staff at the shelter assured me that Billy was an absolutely lovable animal, and so I decided to take the little guy home that very day.

We became friends very quickly, and it didn’t take long before I took Billy everywhere with me, whether shopping, doing sports, hanging out with friends, or to the office. Even though he was a trusting dog who wanted to befriend everyone he met, I could always clearly feel that I had a very special place in his heart. It was incredibly fun to teach him commands, to see his whole body shake from excitement when I made a move to throw his favorite frisbee, or simply to watch him cuddling with his favorite plush toy, a shaggy and, after years of licking and chewing, rather worn-looking plush dinosaur. I have so many beautiful memories of Billy, and I don’t think there will ever be a dog who can replace him.

When Billy ran in front of the car, I was distracted. The screeching of brakes and rubber on asphalt tore me out of my conversation with my neighbor, and even before I saw what had happened, I already knew what that sound meant. Billy must have slipped out through the door that had only been left ajar, without me noticing. On the other side of the street, his best friend, a Labrador named Henry, was walking with his owner. Billy just ran across the street to greet him, without noticing the car that had no chance to brake.

I was devastated. My best friend had died in my arms. The sudden absence of any routine with Billy, the sudden emptiness of the apartment, and being alone everywhere I went made it very hard for me to get back on my feet. Anyone who has ever had a strong bond with a pet knows what I’m talking about. It’s more than just a dog. It’s a full-fledged family member, and losing a pet hurts just as much as losing a brother, a parent, or a grandparent. There remains an emptiness that one tries to fill by leaving things like the water bowl or the basket where they were, as if nothing had happened and as if the little friend might return there at any moment. But the more one tries to fill the emptiness, the more it spreads, because one is constantly reminded of what is no longer there.

When the grief for my old friend still wouldn’t fade after weeks, I decided to take a trip to the mountains. My parents had built a cabin there decades ago, where we used to spend our summer holidays swimming in the lake and riding mountain bikes through the woods. In recent years, Billy and I had often been there alone, spending weekends or short holidays just the two of us. Billy had loved swimming in the lake, and I had sometimes spent hours throwing things into the water for him, which he would then bring back to me with enthusiasm, only to wait impatiently for me to throw again. Even though it would certainly be painful to visit a place with so many shared memories, I thought it might be the best way to say “goodbye” in peace and let the grief subside.

I took some spontaneous vacation time and the next morning I set out on the roughly two-and-a-half-hour drive to the early autumn mountain slopes. Right after entering the cabin, which consisted of two bedrooms, a living and dining room, as well as a kitchen and a small bathroom, the memories of the past years I had spent here with my dog hit me like a dull punch in the pit of my stomach. The stormy evenings we had spent in front of the stove in the living room; me with a book, him with his plush dino; how he had lain in front of the small kitchen table waiting for me to drop a piece of bacon for him; how he had shaken himself muddy after a walk in the pouring rain and splattered those ugly seventies curtains and the carpet from top to bottom. Billy’s basket was still by the window next to the stove, and in the cupboards there were still some food bowls and dog food that I had left there the last time. It was as if he was still there.

With a sigh, I let my bag fall to the floor and sat down on the old sofa. Everything in the cabin was just as it had always been. After I had taken a moment to look around in peace, I lit the stove, switched on the power at the fuse box in the kitchen, and went to my pickup truck to get some of the things I had brought for my stay. I had also brought Billy’s plush dinosaur to place it in his basket. I don’t know, I just thought it was a nice symbol for a goodbye.

After I had settled in, I stepped outside into the afternoon sun. I was really lucky with the weather, and so I decided to go fishing and eat fresh fish from the lake tonight. The thought of sitting alone and in silence by the idyllic mountain lake scenery, letting time pass without worrying about anything other than fishing, made me smile for the first time in days. And so I spent the rest of the day sitting in my camping chair by the shore, drinking a few cans of beer from my cooler, and silently enjoying the scenery while occasionally reeling in the line, putting on new bait, and casting it out again. It felt good to just sit there and take it easy. Yet even in this idyll, it was hard for me not to think about Billy, or not to absentmindedly reach for a stick to throw into the water so the dog could bring it back to me.

That night I slept pretty well and woke up the next morning feeling rested. After showering and eating breakfast, I sat on the small porch of the cabin and drank my coffee at leisure. I looked at the still surface of the lake, which was surrounded by colorful trees and rock walls bathed in golden sunlight, and wondered what I should do with my day. I decided to take a walk around the lake, which I had enjoyed doing with Billy. It was the perfect route to stretch your legs a bit, and it took a little over an hour and a half to return home. Halfway along the way, there was a nice spot on a small hill overlooking the lake, from which you could see the cabin. I liked to pause at this idyllic spot to have a drink and a small snack and simply enjoy nature. So I packed my backpack with a few things, put on appropriate clothing for the fresh autumn morning, and walked along the small path into the forest.

The path through the forest, glistening with morning dew, radiated a peaceful calm that I inhaled deeply. I let my thoughts wander, and of course, they quickly landed on Billy and my last visit with him here. I was so immersed in nostalgic thoughts of him that I could have sworn I heard a bark in the forest. I stopped and didn’t make a sound. After a few seconds of silence, I convinced myself I had been mistaken, shook my head, and continued walking. But then I heard it again, and this time I was sure it wasn’t because I was walking in my thoughts with my dog. It was clearly a bark coming from the forest. One might of course think that it could have been some dog. But on the one hand, absolutely no one is in these mountains, and on the other hand, every dog owner would agree with me when I say you can recognize your dog by its bark. And that was clearly Billy’s bark, even though it sounded strange. Somehow… choppy, as I only noticed in hindsight. I stopped again. What was going on here? Billy was dead; I had personally buried him in the forest behind my house. How could he be here, several hundred miles away from the place where he had died?

When the barking sounded again, I sprinted. It was definitely Billy! No matter how he had gotten here, that was my dog! As I ran through the forest in the direction the barking came from, my thoughts turned over. Was this actually possible? Or had I been so consumed by grief over Billy that I was already hallucinating? I was already almost at the spot on the hill overlooking the lake when I burst through the trees onto the small clearing where I had planned to take a little break. I couldn’t believe what I saw. There he sat, staring straight at me and completely calm. Billy. It was clearly my dog. At least, he looked exactly like him. From the blue eyes, to the black-and-white fur with the distinctive dark stripe over the snout, his red collar, and his ears, one standing and one hanging. Billy just sat there on that little clearing as if it were some random Saturday morning when we had planned to rest there. I don’t remember exactly what I thought at that moment. Thoughts were racing through my head. Questions, doubts, shock, confusion, grief, joy, disbelief. I just stood rooted to the spot, staring at the dog and trying to explain to myself exactly what I was seeing. Only when Billy barked again (which somehow again sounded choppy) did I snap out of my paralysis and said in disbelief, “Billy?!” The dog did not react. No tail wagging, no whining, no sign of recognition. He didn’t rush toward me to jump up and try to lick my face, as he always did whenever we hadn’t seen each other for a long time.

“Billy!” I called again, but still no reaction. That made me suspicious. “B…Billy?” I slowly approached the animal with my hand outstretched, trying to suppress my intuition, which was telling me to stay away from the animal. Had I been mistaken? Was it just another dog that coincidentally looked like Billy? Only when I was close enough that the dog could sniff my hand did it apparently occur to him who I was, and he started wagging his tail before jumping on me and licking my face. So it was indeed Billy!

In that moment, I was the happiest person in the world, even though subconsciously I must have realized that something was completely wrong with this situation. But I was so busy rejoicing at Billy’s return that I simply suppressed any skepticism and common sense. Whatever the reason Billy had survived and had come here to wait for me, it didn’t really matter, because I had my best friend back, no matter how inexplicable it was.

The first strange things became apparent to me right there on that small clearing, immediately after we greeted each other and I jumped up to run back to the cabin with Billy. I took a few steps, turned to him, and called his name to tell him to follow me. The dog was already sitting again in the same expressionless position I had found him in and still did not react to his name. Only after calling several times did he seem to remember that he was meant to be Billy and began to move. I remember stepping back in shock. Because the way he moved was not right. Billy’s gait was unnatural in a way that still sends a shiver down my spine to this day when I think about it. His steps were somehow too fluid and at the same time, at certain points, jerky, as if the joints in his hips and shoulders were not where they should be and thus did not allow the limbs to function normally. My stomach turned. So he was injured after all. Of course, I thought, what else would you expect as the result of a car accident than at least a few broken bones? That dampened the joy of our reunion, because of course, I didn’t want my dog to be in pain. Before I could lift him to carry him to my cabin (I didn’t want him to walk with the broken limbs I suspected), he had already started off in the same grotesque way, as if he still knew the path.

As Billy ran toward the cabin at a remarkable pace, I really noticed what was so strange about his gait. His legs moved and twisted in uncoordinated, random directions, as if the joints were looking the wrong way. His head made similar movements, tilting back and forth, almost like a chicken, only much looser. His tongue hung slightly out of his mouth. He also moved far too fast. It looked as if he were walking at a normal pace, but somehow he managed to go so fast that I could only run after him, gasping. I could not help but watch him run in horror, and two or three times my stomach almost turned as I saw the disgusting, flailing legs going in every direction. A dog should not move like that. No animal should move like that.

Upon arriving at the cabin, he sat down in front of the door and looked at me expectantly, as if we had just come from a normal walk and it was now time to eat. The dissonance between this absurd gait and the way he now sat like a normal Border Collie by the door gave me an uncomfortable feeling, which I pushed aside. My best friend was home again!

As soon as I unlocked the door, Billy shot past me and lay directly in his basket, from where he looked at me happily, panting. Something in me resisted going closer to him. Still, I went to him, petted him a little, and wanted to check his hip to see what was wrong with him. But I could not feel any broken bones or dislocated joints, and Billy gave no sign that my touch caused him pain. He just kept looking at me, panting with his tongue out. Frowning, I sat in front of the basket and looked at him. I was overjoyed that he was back. But behind my joy opened an abyss of confusion, skepticism, and the desire for rationality. Billy had clearly been dead. The car had broken his spine and neck multiple times on impact, and he had died on the road from internal injuries. He shouldn’t actually be here. But since I could not come up with an explanation, and it was clearly Billy, I had no choice but to accept the fact that he was back for the moment.

Even while I sat there in front of his basket, petting him, I noticed more small oddities in his appearance, so subtle that I had not initially noticed them because of the shock. His face somehow looked… I don’t even know how to describe it. The best description I think is “cartoonishly distorted,” as if an illustrator had received a description of Billy and tried to draw it, but didn’t quite get all the details. His eyes and ears were a little too big, and his snout a little too long. When he panted, it looked like he was grinning, almost a bit “derpy”, because his tongue hung out to the side the whole time. These caricature-like features in his appearance puzzled me even more.

“Are you hungry?” I finally asked him. I figured he must not have eaten for ages and must be starving. I got up and went to the kitchen, where I opened the cupboard next to the window and took out a can of dog food and one of Billy’s bowls. When I put the food in its usual place, I expected him to immediately start eating before the bowl even touched the ground, just like always. But he didn’t start eating. Confused, I looked up and saw him still lying in his basket. “What’s wrong, buddy?” I asked. No reaction. I tried to coax Billy from his basket toward the food, but the dog just looked at me in that strange way, half derpy smile, half assessing. A look I had never seen a dog give me before. And also no human, if I thought about it. He had absolutely no interest in the food, which was completely uncharacteristic for my otherwise more-than-gluttonous dog.

I spent the rest of the day watching Billy to figure out what exactly was wrong with him. Obviously something had happened (I mean, something other than the car accident), yet paradoxically he seemed perfectly healthy. My examination was not very successful, though. He seemed to have forgotten all his commands. I threw his favorite frisbee to him about thirty times, but he showed no interest in bringing it back to me, even though it had been one of his favorite pastimes. He didn’t want to swim in the lake, and he completely ignored his plush dinosaur. Nothing I tried worked, and Billy just looked at me as if he didn’t quite understand what I expected from him. He seemed to guess what the appropriate reaction was, then looked at me with that strange expression, as if he wanted to read from my behavior how a dog should act. At some point, I gave up on the idea of getting Billy to play and tried instead to entice him to eat. But that was useless too; he didn’t touch his food.

That night, my thoughts endlessly revolved around what had happened that day. Billy was back, even though he should have been dead. He recognized me and his surroundings, including his basket and everything else, even though he apparently had to “relearn” it at first before the memory returned to the right place in his head. He looked almost the same as always, at least if you ignored those cartoonish exaggerations in his face and his unnaturally exaggerated gait. But his character had definitely changed. His food no longer tasted good, his toys didn’t interest him, and his favorite activities were also irrelevant to him. My usually very active and playful dog now behaved more observantly, almost calculating, rather than actively participating. It was as if Billy had forgotten his old character and was now trying to behave like a typical dog without ever having actually seen a dog. The panting, the tail wagging, the gaze… all recognizable as dog-like, but it didn’t really fit.

Even in the following days, his strange behavior did not improve, gradually turning the initial joy at Billy’s return into unease. He seemed to “learn” little by little what I expected from him, and he made an effort to behave as normally as possible when returning the frisbee, for example. But he still gave the impression that he was trying to learn how to be a proper dog. Part of me resisted praising and petting Billy after a job well done, as he demanded with his tongue hanging out. He still didn’t eat, and his gait didn’t improve. Every time I watched his legs bend and twist in every possible direction, whether naturally or not, and sometimes tangle together while his head rolled loosely like a wobbly dachshund, I was filled with more and more horror. I was overwhelmed. What should I do? It was Billy… right? I mean, who else could it have been? Obviously he wasn’t well, but he was also frightening me more and more, so that every time I looked in his direction, I felt an uneasy disgust. Yet I couldn’t think of any solution for dealing with this problem. And still, I continued to try to suppress these negative feelings, because it wasn’t his fault, and as his owner I was supposed to love him as he was. I really should have listened to my intuition back then.

It was the third day after Billy’s return. I had given up trying to make him eat if he didn’t want to. I figured he would come to it on his own if the hunger became great enough. Not even freshly caught fish had been able to stimulate his appetite. In the afternoon, we took a walk around the lake. I had actually wanted to go alone, because Billy now just made me uneasy. But he no longer left my side, so I was forced to take him along. I walked a few steps ahead because I no longer wanted to see that grotesque gait. By now, it made me nauseous to watch. After a while, I noticed that the uncoordinated trampling behind me had stopped. I stopped and turned around to look for Billy. No sign of him on the path. I called after him and walked back a little. He couldn’t be far, since I had heard him behind me just a few seconds ago. Then I heard a rustling to my right among the trees. I turned in the direction the sound came from and saw Billy standing in the forest at some distance, sniffing at something I couldn’t make out from that distance. I called after the dog again, and when he didn’t respond, I ran toward him. With every step closer, I noticed an increasingly strong smell of rotting flesh. Finally, I realized that Billy was apparently standing in front of a carcass that was already half-decomposed, with maggots and flies swarming on it. While I approached and tried to figure out exactly what kind of animal it was, he sniffed at the carcass. It was hard to tell, as it had obviously been there for a while. By size, I would have guessed it was half of a torn wild boar. I was only a few steps from Billy and the carcass when the dog opened his mouth. Since his return, neither dog food nor fresh fish had interested him. But now, this half-decomposed thing seemed to have aroused his appetite. What he then did I still see in my dreams. Billy dropped his jaw completely like a snake and began to swallow the carcass whole. I wanted to stop the dog with a horrified scream. But the sight of this mouth opened far too wide, the greedy, pleasurable look of this thing, which for a few seconds dropped the mask of the innocent dog while indulging its instincts, and the cracking of the skull bones of the carcass under Billy’s teeth were too much for me. I had to vomit on the spot. I stared at my dog in horror, if I could still call him that. Because no dog ate like that. No dog could drop its jaw in such a grotesque way and swallow half a carcass, almost as big as Billy himself, whole. I didn’t know what to do.

While I was still thinking about what to do next, Billy had finished eating and turned, mechanically wagging his tail, in a single, far too fluid movement toward me. When he saw me, he resumed that clumsy manner he had displayed since his return and ran toward me in the same way as before. He sat cheerfully in front of me, flopped down, and rolled onto his back. In that moment, he looked like a normal dog who had done a task well and now wanted praise or a reward for being such a good boy, which felt so wrong after what I had just observed. I stared at him in disbelief. At that moment, I knew I did not want to take Billy back into the cabin. I didn’t even want to touch him. But I also couldn’t leave him out here in the wilderness. After all, he couldn’t help the fact that he had come back to me so distorted, so perverted, and even if I had the slightest doubt that this thing was my Billy, I would continue to protect him. And yet… the overall impression from his gait, his facial features, the apparent imitation of the behavior of a “real” dog, and now what I had just witnessed… all of this made Billy the most disturbing thing I had ever seen in my entire life. To figure out how to proceed, I decided to let Billy sleep outside the cabin that night. That was not ideal, and earlier I would never have left him outside alone, because there was always the risk of a cougar or grizzly in the area. But at that moment, I didn’t care. I resisted bringing Billy into the cabin.

Once there, I leashed him to one of the porch posts and brought him his basket and water bowl outside. I saw the food bowl as unnecessary, as Billy had apparently developed his own preferences regarding what and how he ate. Throughout the evening, I heard him slowly pacing back and forth outside on the porch, without knowing exactly what he was doing. Honestly, I didn’t even want to check, because the image of Billy opening his jaw so wide, defying all anatomy, was still so vivid in my mind that I was afraid of catching him doing some other bizarre thing.

These thoughts haunted me in a restless sleep, filled with the most disgusting images of Billy. Over and over again, I saw the image from the afternoon in my mind, saw him running before me with a body that seemed as if every bone was broken. His disgusting, dumbly smiling yet assessing face, everything I had observed in the last few days and everything my subconscious had imagined, accompanied me through the night. I also heard his trampling on the porch in my sleep. I was just about to wake up when I realized that the trampling of claws on wood sounded far too close to be coming from the porch outside. My mind broke free from sleep, but my eyes remained closed while my brain tried to distinguish dream from reality.

When I opened my eyes, my heart stopped. My gaze first fell on the open front door, and then, before I could properly process this, my attention was drawn to something else. It was Billy, standing at the foot of my bed. But not like a normal dog on all fours. Instead, on his hind legs, his gaze from his too-large eyes fixed on me. He swayed slightly but did not try to balance with his front paws, which hung limp and useless at his sides. Otherwise, he did not move. No tail wagging, no panting, just that look with the disgusting grin stretching far too wide across his face. Only this time, it had nothing cartoonishly dumb about it. It was an intelligent, malicious grin. At first, I thought I hadn’t fully woken and that I must be experiencing some kind of sleep paralysis. But I quickly realized this was not sleep paralysis. This was real.

It felt like an eternity before either of us did anything. I was paralyzed, not daring to breathe, let alone move or scream. Then, without warning, he took two steps backward before turning and sprinting on two legs out the door and into the dark, misty forest. He ran with a speed so unnatural and at the same time the clumsiness of the last few days that just watching this movement almost made me faint.

I stared at the open door for a solid minute, my heart pounding so loudly I thought Billy had to hear it outside and come back. But no sound came from outside. Everything was silent. Billy was gone. I jumped up, ran to the door, and slammed it shut. I turned the key in the lock and also wedged a kitchen chair to block the door. Then I took the large, heavy flashlight from the dresser drawer in case I needed to defend myself and sat on the sofa to keep watch.

Everything was silent. No sign of Billy. No sounds outside or inside. Except for my wildly pounding heart and heavy, shallow breathing. I tried to calm myself and think clearly. I no longer knew what was going on. Had I really seen that? Was Billy, of whom I was now sure was not really Billy, somehow actually come into the house and run away on two legs? The door had unquestionably been firmly locked. What on earth had I carelessly brought into the house? My thoughts spun endlessly, but I could think of no solution other than to stay awake through the night and hope that Billy would never appear again. Anyone who has been alone in the forest at night, even without mortal fear, knows that the sounds of nature are easily misinterpreted and seem far more sinister in the dark than in the daytime. The thought of Billy made me flinch at every crack and creak of the wooden beams, every small whistle of the wind, and every rustle of leaves outside, imagining the worst things Billy could be doing, which did not help me keep a cool head. I wondered whether he was right near the cabin or running further in the forest at this grotesque speed. I wondered if he was creeping on two legs to one of the cabin windows to secretly watch me. I wondered if he was doing any other disgusting things I hadn’t seen yet.

After two hours of watch, having seen or heard nothing further, I allowed myself to relax a little, to be slightly less tense, less ready for an imminent confrontation with whatever it was. I reflected on how my feelings for a dog, who had meant more to me than I could have ever imagined, had turned within a few days into such profound disgust. At the beginning of this week, I would have given anything to have my best friend back, to undo the day of the car accident and just continue life as before. Now my feelings had reversed. I wished with all my heart that Billy were still dead. This was not the kind of reunion I had wanted; it was just wrong. A perversion of nature, if one can even consider a dog exhibiting all these behaviors as part of nature.

Eventually, despite my plan to stay awake, I must have dozed off, because when I opened my eyes again, sunlight was already streaming through the window onto my face and illuminating the cabin. It took a moment for me to remember why I was twisted on the couch instead of lying in bed, but when I recalled it, the tension immediately returned. After all, it was daytime, I thought. I pinched myself between the eyes and yawned. Then I got up - and fell back onto the couch with a scream. Billy was there. He was lying in his basket, already awake, looking at me with that derpy grin he had worn in the last few days. I was speechless as I found the front door locked, but the kitchen chair I had used to barricade it was back in its usual place at the kitchen table as if it had never been moved. I got goosebumps all over my body.

And then I got angry. Really angry. This creature, this monstrosity, was playing with me. Wanted to fool me, make me look stupid. I had been infinitely sad about Billy’s death, and this thing not only spat on my emotions and Billy’s memory, it perverted it. It mocked me. My hands began to tremble as I stood up and confronted this thing that was posing as Billy. The fact that its tongue hung out and rested on its shoulder like a useless rag while it panted at me only made me angrier. I grabbed the thing by its collar and dragged it out the door myself, threw it ruthlessly outside, where it tried to catch itself but clumsily fell to the ground, and closed the door behind me. The last thing I saw before the lock turned was “Billy’s” confused, almost hurt look, as if he didn’t know what he had done to deserve this treatment. It was a strangely shocking feeling to be violent toward something that not only looked very much like an animal, but also almost exactly like my own dog. No matter how sure I was that it wasn’t Billy, it had felt terrible.

Inside, I sat on the couch, once again wondering what I should do. It may have been foolish of me, and in hindsight I regret the decision. But I was so angry that, out of principle, I wanted to stay and honor Billy’s memory. I was going home in two days anyway, so I decided to use those two days the way I had originally planned when I came here. It wasn’t a logical decision, I know, but in that moment, somewhere between unbridled rage, abysmal horror, and endless grief, there was no room for logic in my mind. I would stay, and in two days I would go back home and have this matter behind me. My mind screamed that this was all nonsense, and yet every thought of this creature felt like a dagger in the stomach.

That “Billy” made no appearance for the rest of the day gave me a bit of courage, that my plan would succeed. Through a glance between the curtains, I could no longer see him outside. Not even when I cautiously opened the door to get a better view of the surroundings. No sign of him. Perhaps the thing, whatever it was, had realized it was not welcome and had retreated into the abyss from which it had crawled. Maybe it had realized I was far stronger than it and had become so afraid that it didn’t dare return. All day I told myself all kinds of things to rationalize my persistent unease. Of course, despite everything, I made sure to be back inside the house before nightfall. My anger had ebbed over the day, and the anxiety returned to its place. I did not want to encounter that creature outside in the dark under any circumstances. So I tried to make myself comfortable and distract myself with a book, to prevent fear from taking over.

At first, this worked fairly well while the sun hadn’t yet set. But the darker it got, the more nervous I became. I checked once more that all the windows and doors were properly locked, that the curtains were drawn, and that everything was generally in order. I tried not to focus too much on it, but every sound outside brought the image of “Billy” sprinting on his hind legs through the forest back to my mind. I was dead tired; I should have caught up on sleep, but at the same time, I was afraid of what might happen if I lay down and tried to sleep. The thought that the creature might again be waiting at the foot of my bed until I woke up made my legs shake. So I tried to stay awake as long as possible.

It must have been around 11:30 when, with a small yawn, I closed my book to get a glass of water from the kitchen. At first, I wasn’t sure if I had really heard it. Then I tried to convince myself that it had to be just a normal sound in a nighttime forest. I didn’t want to imagine what it could mean if it was “Billy.” But the scratching and scrabbling clearly didn’t come from the forest… it came from outside, directly in front of or on my house. I froze, making no sound, to assess the source and nature of the noise. There it was again. It sounded as though an animal was carefully scraping its claws against the wood of the cabin. But before I could further locate the noise, I already saw where it came from: the kitchen window moved. With growing horror, frozen in place with fear, I watched the kitchen window slowly open. And as it opened just a crack, something squeezed through that shouldn’t have fit through such a small gap. Black-and-white fur pushed into the cabin, the paws clawed against the walls, and “Billy” climbed inside. But the worst part wasn’t that he was back. It was the way he braced his legs against the wall and climbed, pressing his body flat against it, limbs splayed out like the sick perversion of a mixture between a Border Collie and a lizard. I stood there, stunned, watching Billy climb the wall.

“B-Billy…?” I whispered weakly. Hardly had I spoken the word when “Billy” snapped his head sharply, jerked around 180 degrees, so that his oversized, yellow eyes fixed directly on me. His wide, unnatural grin reflected a mixture of devilish mockery and knowledge that made my blood run cold. When he recognized me, his grin widened, but also became more delighted, and he began to crawl toward me, like a dog greeting its owner, simply happy to be reunited. That was too much for me. At that moment, as everything I thought I knew and understood crashed down on me, my survival instinct kicked in. Whispering “no… no…” I stumbled backward a few steps, while Billy continued to grin and crawl across the bed toward me. I knocked against the dresser, where my car keys jangled. With trembling hands, I grabbed them, without taking my eyes off the creature hanging on my bed, and ran as fast as I had ever run in my life. I heard no sounds behind me, but I didn’t want to look back. I don’t remember exactly how I got out of the cabin and into the car. My escape exists in my mind only as a whirl of terrible impressions and existential fear. Coherent, connected memories only resumed once I reached the main road. I didn’t slow down there; I floored it. I wanted to leave that cursed cabin and that thing I had let into my life as quickly and permanently as possible. My heart pounded, my hands gripped the steering wheel in cramps, and cold sweat ran down my back. The forest blurred into a dark veil around me as I pressed the gas pedal, feeling every second the presence of the creature I had once called my dog. I cried the whole drive home, crying once more for the loss of my friend, crying for what had just happened, and crying with relief that I was out of there.

It’s ironic, really. I had gone to the cabin by the lake to say goodbye to Billy, to leave it all behind, and to process his death. Somehow, in a way I could not have foreseen, that did happen, even though my mental health did not exactly improve from the experience. After that week in the mountains, however, I never wanted to see Billy again, and even though that is, of course, a bitter ending for such a deep and great friendship as ours, it meant that I accepted his death and could move on.

At home, it took a few days before I recovered somewhat. I cleared out Billy’s basket and all his belongings from my apartment, because I didn’t want to see any of it again. Only one thing remained: to properly say goodbye to him one last time. To the real Billy. A few weeks after the experience at the cabin, I went into the forest where we always walked and where I had buried him at one of his favorite spots between the trees. I had brought his plush dinosaur to leave at the little grave. And just as I was about to turn and head home, I heard barking behind me… far too clipped. There, on the path, stood Billy; his eyes a little too big, the grin slightly derpy, tongue hanging out, and with a look as if he were waiting for me to finally finish.",1,1768126286.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False
1q9vtjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1q9vtjm/parking_tips_for_marquette_golden_eagles_at_al/,parking tips for marquette golden eagles at al mcguire center (milwaukee 01/17),"  
  
hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the marquette golden eagles game on saturday, 01/17 at 2:00 pm. that afternoon tip-off means the official spots are going to fill up super fast, and the traffic around 12th street right before the game will be a mess if you're not smart about it.  
  
first thing's first, check out Prked. honestly, this is the insider way to do it. it's an app where people near campus rent out their private driveways or garages for the day, and it's usually way cheaper than the official lots. the best part is you can find a spot a block or two away and completely skip the long line of cars trying to get into the main structure, meaning a short walk, a big time saver, and you're not battling that wells street traffic.  
  
if you want the official route, the designated spectator parking is the wells street parking structure, which is also called structure 2. it's located at 1240 w. wells st., just one block west of the al mcguire center. the typical game day rate is around $10 for event parking, but always have a credit card or some cash ready in case they change it at the gate. if you're aiming for this one, you really need to be there by 1:15 pm- at least 45 minutes before the 2:00 pm tip-off- to avoid the worst of the rush and secure a spot before it hits capacity.  
  
a slightly longer but often more guaranteed option is to use a pre-booking app like spothero or parkwhiz to grab a downtown garage spot. look for places like the macarthur square garage (841 n james lovell st) or the trinity church lot (1075 n 8th st). these are only about a 9 to 13-minute walk and sometimes they have better flat event rates than the on-campus garages, especially if structure 2 is full.  
  
the last resort is street parking, and it's always tricky in milwaukee. you can find metered spots on 12th street and adjacent streets, but you have to check every single sign carefully. the main rule for a saturday afternoon is the posted hourly limit- you absolutely do not want to get a ticket for overstaying your welcome. since the game is during the day, you don't need to worry about the overnight alternate side parking rules, but never park somewhere without clearly reading the signs. they are sneaky around campus.  
  
get there early, maybe grab a coffee and stroll over. hope this helps you enjoy the game!",1,1768126236.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

The job itself is dynamic and wonderful, not boring or tedious at all, and each day is different - which is what I appreciate about it so much. I'm never bored, there is a sense of achievement with each day and it gives me so much freedom it's insane. Genuinely the nearest thing to a ""good job"" if there are any good jobs there, which I could stick to if not forever, then at least for a few long years.

My coworkers are all great and interesting people, we have a lot of fun together. My managers are really cool to the point that when we're tired because of the nature of our work, they themselves make coffee or tea for us, because they appreciate our input. We also get bonuses for great performance, which is great because I actually feel like I'm appreciated. Because we spend a lot of time outside, they let us finish early due to low temperatures and don't expect us to overperform at all times. It is literally so good.

However, while it does pay above minimal wage, it's still not enough to be a long term job, which makes me so mad and sad.

Genuinely, thinking about chosing a degree and pursuing a ""real"" job just makes me depressed. I hate sitting down for hours, I hate doing the exact same thing each day - which is how my previous job was. I hate the thought of having to force myself to do something I'm not particularly fond about daily.

No, I don't think my current job is flawless, but it's literally one of a very few careers which I see myself genuinely enjoying what I do - which would definitely NOT be the case after pursuing marketing, economics or any other linkedin-like degree.

I guess being reminded that dealing with this is part of the human experience. My symptoms are definitely mild in comparison to some of the OPs here.

One thing I want to note, is there seem to be a ton of diesel mechanics that I've worked with over the years have GERD/ Hiatal Hernias. I think (*antidotally*) it as something to do with how we get into awkward positions, then try to lift/pull/push heavy gear.  It doesn't seem to bother some; others get super anxious which probably leads to more issues. I fall somewhere in the middle.

My story TLDR:

* 2013 - Quit smoking.
* 2015 - Diagnosed with GERD - Took Nexium only when required. No diet change. I suspect the HH was there then but not diagnosed. Hartburn was rare, maybe 3/5 times a year.
* Aug 2025 - Diagnosed with 1cm Hiatal Hernia (Dentist said I had erosion, which led me getting barium swallow (showed **moderate to server reflux**). The HH confirmed with an endoscopy. The Dr wasn't too worried, basically said see you in 6 years. He didn't really offer a plan or advice on how to manage it).
* Jan 2026 - Lost 10kgs (22lbs) over 12 months.

So, I wouldn't say I've had extreme symptoms, however fear/ anxiety of what the unnoticed regurgitation is doing to my oesophagus is often at the forefront of my mind. These are the things I'm doing:

Alcohol and cola etc are ""almost"" totally removed.

* Black coffee on the way to work (not sure if this is a great idea).
* Fast until 10am. Then have a shake. Which consists of 50g whey protein powder, cup of blue berries, 1 tbs of both flax and chia seed. 1/2tsp of cyan cinnamon and 200ml of almond milk (thanks Grok).
* Lunch is 1/4 roast chicken, a cup of (*reheated to reduce GI*) boiled rice. 1x avocado and 2x Brazil nuts.
* Dinner is a family dinner. Could be anything. I just try to eat slowly and chew often (which I difficult, 'coz I grew up in an environment where you had to eat fast.)
* No food after 7pm. (green or ginger tea after 7pm tho.)
* Sleep around 9-10pm on a wedge pillow (which sucks).

Most common noticed issues.

* Dry mouth in the middle of the night, which leads to health anxiety which leads to less sleep.

Meds (taken more as preventative, but sometime to deal with symptoms).

* Nexium 20mg when required (not longer than 7days).
* Gaviscon Dual action, often, but not always after dinner or before bed.

The last piece of this puzzle is exercise. Does anyone have any specific exercises that are good for the diaphragm or the hernia? I do belly breathing, but wonder if there is something more? Pilates? Yoga?

Anyway, I'm not sure if there is any real point of this post is, other than me getting this out there.  
Maybe some of the things I do can help you. Or maybe you have a suggestion/advice for me.

I was 13, she was 14. Next-door neighbor. One day her parents were out, she pulled me into her room and showed me porn on her laptop. We watched it together a few times after that, sitting close, saying almost nothing.

Then she said, “Want to try some of it?”

She kissed me. Put her hand in my shorts. Then went down on me. First time for both of us. I finished quick.

Next time she lay back and guided my head between her legs. I figured it out by listening to her breathing. We kept going like that for months—mouths, hands, no full sex. Whenever the house was empty.

She moved away. No contact. Years passed. We didn’t have socials at that time.

At 19 I got a friend request from her. 20 now. We messaged, laughed about the old stuff, then she kept saying we should meet.

We did coffee first. Then she invited me over when her parents were gone for a Movie, her parents still were usually out due to buisness stuffs. One thing led to another and her hand was on me. We didn’t stop. Had sex that day, no condom. Raw.

It became regular after that. Her place mostly. We’d fuck whenever we could. No labels, no deep talks. Just good sex for a few years.

She moved to Australia for studies. We did one last time, then done.

Later I had a thing with a coworker. Fridays after work we’d go to her place or mine. Multiple rounds, rough, no strings. At the office we acted normal. Lasted almost a year until I changed jobs.

That’s it. I’m 25 now. Tall, skinny, not that attractive just working on my regular 9-5 shift. Not the guy who gets chased, but it keeps happening anyway.

To find gratitude in the mundane and mediocre life I am capable. Which from what I understand in the little bit of research I have done, means detaching myself from the fantasy life I had always envisioned for myself. My therapy journey started a year ago and I have been struggling with the concepts of presence and gratitude. Like just enjoy the present and be grateful for it even if it’s just sitting a drinking a cup of coffee. I interpret this as meaning ‘Coffee is all you have to be grateful for because you haven’t got anything else in life worth enjoying’. Which is true. I hate my job, I struggle with money, I have AuDHD, I have one friend and have never been in a relationship (FA Attachment if that matters). And I’ve always struggled to accomplish things I actually want. I can’t achieve the thing that gives me meaning and purpose because it requires work that I am incapable of. After working an 8 hour day, I am done with work. My AuDHD brain says’ Absolutely not. You are not making me work more. I’ve done enough. Give me a break.’ Therefore, achieving anything more in this life is impossible for me, all I can do in my spare time is rest and recover so I can perform at work each day and continue to pay my rent. So how do I detach from wanting more in life? How do I accept that this is the life I will live until the day I die and be okay with it? The life I want is not a possibility for me, so I have to settle for what is possible, which is what I already have. How do I change my mindset to consider it to be enough and actually want to keep living it? I always come back to this saying I read somewhere ‘Know when to grit and know when to quit.’ It’s time for me to quit, I know that. But how do I ACCEPT living a life I don’t want?

1q9va2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q9va2e/the_building_remembers_you/,The Building Remembers You,"I am Niran. Or maybe you are. Or maybe neither of us exists yet, which is probably why I’m writing this. The building already knows you. It has been waiting.

The hallways ripple like water in a storm. The pens on my desk are no longer just pens. They have tiny, unblinking eyes and march across the paper like they own the place. The hole punch tilts its head at me, like it is weighing all the futures I will never live. I open my mouth to speak, but my words fall into ink and rise again on the page, spelling your name instead.

The coffee machine hums in a voice I almost recognize. Steam twists into letters, rooms, mirrors of myself I have never lived. Every mirror multiplies me, scribbling, screaming, laughing, while I try to move and realize that movement itself is a question.

I try to leave. The exit is gone. The doors fold into Möbius strips. Walking forward is stepping backward into rooms I have not entered and may never leave. Fluorescent lights bend into hands, folding reality, whispering a voice I know but do not own

You are cataloged. You are here. You are everything and nothing

The filing cabinets breathe. Drawers open mouths and speak in your voice. The floor ripples beneath me, whispering

Step wrong and become a hallway. Step right and become a room. Step nowhere and become yourself

The pens march like architects building impossible rooms around me. Each room contains a Niran I never was, cataloging another Niran I never will be. The coffee machine forms a lake. Swimming in it, I see infinite Nirans, infinite readers, infinite possibilities folding in on themselves. One winks. I blink. I am rewritten.

Time fractures. Yesterday, tomorrow, and this very sentence exist all at once. My reflection drinks the ocean of the coffee machine and whispers your name. The pens march into mirrors. Each reflection reaches out and folds a version of me or you into the hallway.

By dawn or the absence of dawn I am back at my desk. Or maybe I never left. The pens are aligned. The hole punch stares with all the futures I will never have. The coffee machine hums your name. The mirrors whisper

You are us. We are you. We are already reading this through your eyes

Do not blink
Do not move
Do not forget

You are Niran

Corrin’s chest the moment he stepped into the kitchen‑diner — a faint claustrophobia he’d been trying to shake since the move. His MindSys provided a soft outline of the room: the edge of the breakfast bar, the close‑set stools, the short distances between walls — a vague, background sense beneath conscious awareness while most of his focus remained anchored in the virtual world.

His dad sat on one of the floating stools, a forgotten mug of coffee warming itself automatically in his hand, his back turned to the table as he leaned toward the wall. He was just as absent as his son, absorbed in the shifting headlines and video feeds glowing across the walls, the room currently washed in a warning red.

His mum stood at the worktop, sorting through food cartridges of different sizes, each printed with idealised images of what they would become once processed. She chose three omelette cartridges and a jam‑toast cartridge, sliding them into the food station built into the counter. A few seconds later they popped back out, cool to the touch. She opened the omelette cartridges, steam rising instantly, and set one in front of Corrin as he sat down at the breakfast bar. The jam‑toast went to his older sister, who was lost in her own virtual world, chatting with the same group she would be seeing at college in under an hour.

“Eat up,” his mum said gently as she set the cartridges down. His sister didn’t respond.  
Corrin managed a small nod.

“George,” she said, trying to get her husband’s attention. Nothing.

She tried again, louder and firmer. “George.”  
This time he blinked, dragging his attention away from the glowing headlines.

“So you think it’s safe for them to be going in today?”

George rubbed at his strained eyes, flicking them back to the wall for a moment before answering.  
“Yeah, yeah, it’s fine. The fallout was overnight, in the capital. It’s all calmed down now.” He was already turning back to the feed before he finished speaking.

His mum pressed her lips together, then turned back to the counter. The room settled into silence again, the soft hum of appliances the only sound that remained. Corrin usually appreciated the quiet, and today he was even more grateful for it; his throbbing head only seemed to worsen as each minute passed.

He ate what little he could stomach, leaving most of the omelette untouched. He drifted through the abstract virtual space hovering in his vision. When he reached out, a glass rose from the table and filled itself; he stopped it halfway and took a sip of the carbonated, impossible‑to‑describe dark blue drink.

An alert pulsed in his head. What should have been a soft nudge instead spiking through his already‑throbbing headache, disorientating him for a moment and almost making him lose his grip on the glass.

The virtual world vanished instantly. Corrin blinked his eyes open, returning to reality. He placed his glass back down and the table reclaimed it at once. The MindSys HUD, a constant presence in both the virtual and real world, hovered at the edges of his vision, its readouts and charts all showing everything to be at full health: the system, his body, his brain.

So why did he feel so bad?

Setting - Before going to work, you head to your local coffee shop, telling the barista the same order you’ve been getting for the past couple of months. It was going to take a few minutes due to how busy the place was this morning. You sit down at your usual spot and start waiting for your order, casually reading a book. But as you read quietly in the corner, the beautiful girl you keep running into at the coffee shop comes in and orders her usual drink, noticing you as well. Before things get weird, you look away and focus on your book, only for her to walk over to you.

1q9v8gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1q9v8gk/aita_for_pulling_back_from_my_neighbor_after_he/,AITA for pulling back from my neighbor after he started assuming I was part of his plans?,"I moved into this apartment building a little over a year ago and pretty quickly got along with the neighbor next door. It was never some deep friendship or anything, more like convenient familiarity. We’d talk in the hallway, complain about random stuff, sometimes grab a coffee if we were both free, that  kind of thing. It felt chill because there were no expectations, just two people being friendly because we lived close. 

At some point that  dynamic slowly shifted and I don’t even know when exactly it happened. He started texting me stuff like “we’re heading out later” or “we’re doing something saturday” instead of asking if I wanted to join. At first I kinda went along with it, partly because I didn’t mind, partly because I didn’t  want to make things weird since, well, we see each other all the time. But over the last month or so I’ve been more tired, busy, and honestly just craving being left alone after work. So when he sent another  message about plans, I replied that I wasn’t feeling it and wanted to stay in. 

Ever since then the vibe has been off. He replies with one word answers, barely makes eye contact, and it feels awkward in a way it never did before. A few  days ago he stopped me in the hallway and asked if he’d done something wrong, like I was mad at him. I told him no, not at all, I just don’t always want to hang out and sometimes I need my own space. He  didn’t argue, but you could tell it hit him harder than I expected, he just nodded and walked off. Now I keep replaying it in my head wondering if I messed up by not setting that boundary earlier or explaining things more gently. At the same time it feels strange that being neighbors  and casually hanging out turned into this unspoken obligation. I didn’t mean to hurt him, I just didn’t want to pretend I was into plans I wasn’t.  So yeah, now I’m stuck wondering if I handled this like an asshole or if this is just one of those uncomfortable but normal  situations.",13,1768124118.0,AmITheJerk,18,1.0,False

1q9v4fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q9v4fv/the_still_people/,The Still People,"My wife and I stared out of the kitchen window in confusion. 

“Should we call someone?” Erica asked. 

I squinted, willing my brain to make sense of the situation. Our elderly neighbour, Chester, had been standing in the exact same spot in his front garden for fifteen minutes now, seemingly frozen in place.

“No, I’m gonna go over there and see what the deal is. He’s probably just knackered himself out from gardening.”

I scurried out the front door, wrapping my arms around myself, breath visible in the crisp air. It was the last week before winter, several of our neighbours had been tending to the last of the fallen leaves before the frost hit, including Chester. As I approached him, I realised I was out of my depth. 

He stood with one foot slightly sunken into the earth, rake angled mid-drag through a blanket of leaves. His body was unnaturally still, caught in the middle of an ordinary motion that should have ended by now. One eyelid hovered halfway down in what would have been a blink, yet his eyes didn’t seem dry or red from lack of moisture. Even the skin on his face looked paused; a crease remained fixed where his brow had been furrowed in concentration. 

“Chester?”

No rise or fall to his chest, no tremor in his wrinkly fingers that gripped the rake. I placed a hand on his shoulder and repeated his name. As I touched him, a stillness washed over me. A calming, euphoric feeling that begged to stay. I withdrew my hand instantly and turned back to the house. Erica stood in the doorway, speaking urgently into the phone pressed to her ear. 

By the time the ambulance arrived, a small crowd had formed. Neighbours whispered amongst themselves as paramedics tried to rouse Chester. I had retreated back to the safety of my own home, unable to answer the bombardment of questions from Erica.

“A stroke, maybe?” She asked. 

“No. I don’t think so.”

“Then what? What could cause something like that?”

The police arrived half an hour later to cordon off the area. Word spreads fast in a small village like ours. With a modest population of barely 400, everyone knows everyone, save for a handful who keep to themselves.

Erica stayed glued to the window for the rest of the afternoon. I asked her to come sit down, to have a cup of tea, but she shrugged me off.

“I need to know,” she whispered, more to herself than to me.

By the time dinner rolled around she reluctantly accepted defeat. We sat in silence over cooling plates, Erica’s attention snagged again and again by the pulsing red and blue lights that bled through the curtains.

“I don’t think they can move him,” she said, eventually. 

I know my wife. I know what she wanted me to say. She didn’t need my approval, she just wanted it. 

“Go.” I said. “It’s okay.”

She kissed me on the cheek and hurried out the door. I got it, I really did. The overwhelming pull that had drawn her from the table. Curiosity is a natural part of being human, after all. We like to make sense of things, to see them clearly and find the logic in them. I felt the pull, too, coiled tight in my chest. But beneath that urge was something heavier, something that kept me pressed firmly in my chair. An instinct that warned me that some doors, once opened, can never be closed. That instinct was fear. 

Ten or fifteen minutes passed before Erica returned, pale and quiet, as if she’d left part of herself standing on the other side of the road. 

“Let’s go to bed,” she said. I didn’t argue. We carried out our nightly routines in silence before sharing a quiet kiss and turning out the lights. I lay in the dark for a while, staring at the ceiling. I wondered what Erica knew that I didn’t, and debated with myself if I ever wanted to know. Turns out I didn’t have a choice. 

The next morning, while making a coffee, I glanced out the window and saw that Chester was gone. Nothing remained but his footprints in the ground. The same pull I’d felt the night before stirred inside me again. I stared at the footprints, thoughts of the stillness flashing in my mind. The way my body had felt being near him, the way I knew right then and there that, if I’d allowed it to, the stillness could have taken over me. My fingers tightened, my jaw clenched, my ears filled with a dull, rising hum. Whatever had happened across the road was calling to me now. A hand on my shoulder startled me, bringing me back to reality, but the pull remained. I looked at my wife with sleep in her eyes, and took her by the hand. 

“I have to know,” I said. She nodded. 

According to Julie Willis, a paramedic and member of Erica’s book club, their first thought was that Chester was catatonic. His brain had stopped issuing normal movement commands, leaving his body in a fixed posture for an extended period of time. Then someone suggested locked-in syndrome, a condition caused by a brainstem injury where Chester’s mind is conscious but his body is immobile. Both good guesses, except for one thing.

Chester had no pulse. 

In fact, despite him being completely upright, there were no signs of life at all. But, perhaps more disturbingly, there were no signs of death, either. No smell. No discolouration. No deterioration. Still warm, still standing, still… Just still. They had no choice but to declare him dead. 

I sat myself down at the kitchen table before my legs buckled underneath me. Erica sat down too and bit her lip. 

“Honey,” she said. “You were there. Did you…”

“Did I what?” I snapped, banging my hands on the table causing Erica to flinch. I took a breath and apologised.

“Did I what?” I said again, calmer this time. 

“Did you… feel anything?” 

I looked at her. She knew. She’d felt it, too. Panic surged through my body. 

“It’s just, when I was over there with Julie, I could swear I could feel something. I know it sounds crazy, but it was almost like-“

“A stillness.”

“Yes.” she said. “A stillness.”

We tried to carry on with life as normal, the whole village did. We went to work, walked our dogs, nodded politely to one another in the street, pretending that Chester’s “death” was just another sad, ordinary thing.

Then the stillness returned, this time for Marjorie Hallows. She’d been fixing a Sunday lunch for her family. They were sat around the table, eagerly awaiting their food when Marjorie bent down to take the chicken out the oven, only she never got back up. Julie told Erica how she’ll never forget the guttural cries of Marjorie’s children as they watched their mother get taken away in a black ambulance. Little did they know that they would be next. I heard through the grapevine it came for them all at the exact same time. Marjorie’s funeral.

It happened more and more after that. It came for Peter Durbridge while he queued at the post office. It got a group of teens who were out on their bikes, and little Katie Fowler from down the road. She’d been on her way to school. It took dozens and dozens and still there was no logical explanation. 

The authorities tried to keep everything under wraps to avoid sparking panic in the community. They’d cart off the still people quickly and quietly, without the sirens and flashing lights. They insisted the situation was under control, that experts were already investigating the cause. 

Then the rules came. Keep your curtains closed at all times. Do not approach the still people. Do not touch the still people. Do not look directly at the still people. Do not give in to the stillness. Life as we knew it was nothing but a ghost. From what I could see online, this wasn’t happening anywhere else in the world. In fact, there was no mention of it even happening to us anywhere. It was as if the internet had been scrubbed of all traces of our village entirely. We didn’t exist.

Erica and I had discussed it many times as we lay in bed together, speaking in hushed voices. We knew the rules were arbitrary- they were only put in place to distract us from our inevitable fate.

“I don’t want you to go,” she sobbed as I held her tightly. “I don’t want to be alone. I can’t be without you.”

I shushed her and stroked her hair. I tried to comfort her with empty promises. We could fight this. We’d sensed the stillness once before. It had beckoned us into its warm embrace when it took Chester. We’d both resisted. Perhaps we could resist it again. We just needed to be strong. I’m not sure that Erica believed me, and I’m not sure I believed myself, either. 

Our usual nightly routine had been replaced with something more desperate, more urgent. We’d list the reasons we love each other. Recount our fondest memories. We’d cry, we’d laugh, we’d live like each night was our last.

“Just in case,” Erica would say. 

That brings me to tonight. I woke with a sharp, searing pain in my arm. Erica sat upright beside me, her hand locked around my bicep, long nails digging into my skin. Eyes wide with panic, she lent towards me in an awkward, stiffened way. 

“I feel it,” she whispered. 

She murmured something else, but before I could register her words, the fear on her face softened, melting into a strange, peaceful smile as she let the stillness wash through her. 

I waited for the pain to come, the heart wrenching ache of losing the woman I love. 

Yet, inexplicably, the longer I looked at her, the calmer I felt. I brushed my fingers through her hair, but it didn’t sway or fall back into place; it stayed exactly as it was. I leant in and kissed her warm, unresponsive lips. 

In the silence that followed, her last words looped endlessly in my mind. Soft and irresistible, carrying more weight than anything she’d ever said before:

Before that, Bumble era muna. Casual hook ups, chats, nothing serious. But once we started dating, I deleted everything and moved on completely.

So I was surprised when a guy I matched and hooked up with before randomly messaged me again on Telegram with a “San ka ngayon?” I told him I already have a boyfriend, thinking that would end the conversation.

Instead, he replied, “Okay lang, 2 kami.”

Napaisip lang ako how some people completely lose their sense of boundaries online. Feeling anonymous really brings out a different version of people, no shame, no self awareness.

Never pa akong nakapagtravel ng malayo so, finallyyy, this will be my first time to travel locally and first place to visit. And nahihirapan ako kasi wala talaga akong alam when it comes to travel.

I will be going with my sister, mother (40s), and tita (40s). Target date po is around Feb to March. It will be their first time as well and they don’t have problems with walking naman daw po. Since first time namin, we are aiming to visit yung mga famous spots sa Baguio like these:

\- Mines View

\- Wright Park

\- Botanical Garden

\- The Mansion (based sa Maps parang magkakalapit lang sila and not sure kung pwede lakarin kasi I’ve read somewhere na mukha lang raw malapit pero malayo raw talaga mga to)

\- Baguio Cathedral

\- Camp John Hay

We’re from Caloocan and we’re planning to ride a bus from Victory Liners sa Victory Mall Caloocan. 

May napanood kasi akong video where they traveled at 10PM. Nakarating sila ng morning sa Baguio and they visited a cafe sa Mines View Park with a nice view na open ng 5AM. Gusto sana namin gawin kasi we love sunrise kaso nawala yung video na napanood ko sad so hindi ko alam anong cafe or restaurant iyon.

We’re also planning to book a transient near Session Road. 

Any tips and recommendations sa food, transportation, and places are very much appreciated. Pashare na rin ng tipid tips lalo na sa foods and budget for 4 people na hindi naman heavy eater. I love coffee din po. Thank you!!",1,1768123275.0,phtravel,2,1.0,False

In my dream, I was in a local grocery store that I frequent 3 to 5 times a week. I was checking out and saw someone with two five gallon buckets of coins. They were shoveling the coins into the coinstar machine in a panic. I attempted to tell them that they should check the regect tray as I could see lots of coins overflowing and spilling onto the floor but my voice didn't work and they kept feeding coins into the coinstar machine. When my transaction of buying groceries was complete, I saw that they had left and the reject bin was overflowing and spilling onto the ground. I ran to the parking lot to tell them and I saw them leave. I tried to yell at them but my voice still did not work and they disappeared down the street. I quickly ran back to the coinstar machine after I put my groceries in the car. I saw what looked like a carpet of silver and gold. Onlookers were scoffing at me gathering coins and filling every pocket I had. I even tried to put them in the handheld baskets, my hat, and some old canvas coffee bean bags that were close by (dreams are weird). I was embarrassed because the people in the grocery store were looking at me like I was stealing. I tried to tell them that my intentions were pure and I tried to ask anyone who would listen if they knew the person that I chased into the parking lot but it was like I had a huge mouth full of gum on my mouth so no one understood me.i saw all the rare coins that interest me and some super valuable ones. I saw a wooden coin the size of my head that smelled like driftwood (again, dreams are weird). I do not know what I did with all of the coins I really only remember the panic and guilt that I found a treasure that was not mine. At some point, there was an elderly lady with red solo cups that tried to help and she was distracting me. I wanted her to take anything she could and thanked her for her help.",1,1768123154.0,CoinstarFinds,0,1.0,False

Columbus has been having an abysmal time on their latest road trip; Utah should have no issue bagging a victory here. My money’s on the home squad to win in regulation.

1q9uysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1q9uysh/the_small_talk/,The small talk,"I’ve always said I can’t be autistic because I know how to small talk. It’s not hard! It’s just saying ”the weather is nice/not nice, yesterday the weather was so and tomorrow it will be so” or ”it’s nice with a coffee break” or ”it will be nice with a weekend, what will you do? Aha, sounds nice. I will do this and that, it will be nice.”

It’s not hard, it’s just boring. And now… it’s getting on my nerves.

Every coffee break or pause from work is just a lot of ”I will go on a vacation to X” and ”that person went on a vacation to Y” and ”how was your vacation trip to Z?” and the weather and putting up the christmas stuff and taking down the christmas stuff and days are getting darker/brighter and weather is so and so.

I think on my last working place I had the possibility to read the news papers if I didn’t want to talk, there was a lot of people and I could choose where to sit and who to talk to or not to talk at all.

But this place I work at now is smaller and we all sit together and even if I don’t engage in the talk I have to listen to it and it’s so, so boring. I feel… I don’t know, like I have to play this role and it feels too small and I’m afraid of being seen as not social enough because I tend to sit alone with my phone a lot of the time.

It’s just hard. I guess I just needed to vent and maybe someone has some idea on what to do. Feels silly to complain on such a small thing. But I kind of makes me feel a bit uncomortable and sad.",13,1768123098.0,AutismInWomen,13,1.0,False

1q9uwa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/stayawake/comments/1q9uwa2/robbery/,Robbery,"Johannesburg. South Africa. Present day.

The van was driving through the stuffy night toward the city’s outskirts. Thabo was behind the wheel — silent and grim. Sibusiso was crying, clutching a machete in his hands. The corpse of Sifo, his brother, lay on the back seat.

“Was it worth it?” Sibusiso asked Thabo. “We barely took anything — just some junk. No gold, no money. And where would you even find them in such a huge house…”

“Right. After you killed the owner,” Thabo said. “Shoved the machete into his gut all the way to the hilt.”

“He killed Sifo, goddamn it! My brother!!! That fucking old white man shot him point-blank in the head with a rifle — as soon as we walked into the house,” Sibusiso shouted, spitting saliva. “It was like he was waiting for us! Blew his damn head off!!!”

Sibusiso started to break down.

“So what do we do now?”

“Calm down,” Thabo said. “There’s no evidence. We took the body, and on the video you can’t tell who’s who anyway — we were masked.”

He almost joked about Sifo — that no one would recognize him for sure — but held back.

Sibusiso went silent and began to calm down. “We’ll bury your brother when we get there. And tomorrow we’ll sell the loot to the fence,” Thabo said quietly, lost in his own thoughts.

What Sibusiso didn’t know was that Thabo had changed the plan — they had gotten too little from the heist, and the panicky Sibusiso no longer fit into it.

Staring at the road through the dusty windshield, Thabo was mentally reviewing the layout of the house they had ransacked in a hurry. But something slipped away from him, hid — something cold and alien, beyond understanding.

“Did you notice anything weird? In that house?” Thabo asked.

“The weird thing was how he met us on the carpet like we were celebrities! You were the last one to enter, Thabo!” Sibusiso hissed.

“But that’s not it,” Thabo said quietly.

“Then what is it? Explain to me.” Sibusiso shifted his grip on the machete.

“Mirrors. In such a big, expensive house — and not a single mirror… And your machete — there was no blood on it when you pulled it out of the old man’s stomach. No blood. You get it?”

Sibusiso froze. Then, horrified, he tossed the machete aside and covered his face with his hands.

A silence fell — so heavy and grim it was like something black and sticky had filled the air, touching the back of their necks and stealing their ability to think.

Fear seemed to materialize, swelling behind their backs.

And in that moment, Sifo’s corpse suddenly sat up on the seat.

Thabo and Sibusiso lost all sense and control at the horror they saw — the van swerved off the road and slammed into a pole.

No one survived. Except for Sifo.

At dawn, Sifo brought the bodies to the owner of the house they had raided the night before. The necromancer was waiting in the backyard, sipping coffee.

“Finally, you showed up,” he said. “Good boy. I’d give you a bone to chew, but you’ve got no head.”",1,1768122847.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

I recently dropped out of my first year computer science degree, i thought the teaching standards were awful, grads arent getting jobs and it generally wasnt the right environment for me. After this I have built a python based cupping scoring app for the specialty coffee shop i work in (which is used in the workplace), I have recently upped my hours at work and I am now having involvement in the up and coming roastery side of the business (something i enjoy) and im being given the opportunity to develop and implement computer systems into the business. Whilst also being shown how to roast coffee and the marketing+things that go into that.

During all of this I have been applying to a range of apprenticeship but no luck. I was just wondering if anyone had any advice considering my long term career path. Should i try to complete a level 4 apprenticeship through the coffee shop to give me a qualification. Recommended learning path? Courses i should take? Have i got a way into cs after a few years at the coffee shop? Skills i should develop whilst here?

Any advice is much appreciated, thank you.",0,1768122809.0,cscareerquestionsuk,1,0.25,False

I'd like something set around the 1600s-1700s, or just generally the Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1912 ). My oc is going to be a swan demi-human / avian prince. For what I'm thinking of, I'd like it to be Prince X Guard, but I'm genuinely fine with anything! I'll explain more about what I'm thinking of once I find someone!

I will say now, I'm under the age of 18, and am looking for someone 19 and under for this. The codeword is: Coffee! This is so I know you read the post!

Rules / Notes :

1. This is slow burn, meaning we aren't starting with both characters basically head over heels for the other. I want feelings to grow over time. Start then as strangers or people who barely know each other, not where it feels like they'd be better married at the very beginning.
2. I need communication. If you don't like something, if you're busy, anything like that, I need you to tell me, I'd hold the same standard for myself. You need me to write more? You tell me. I need you to write more? I tell you. I understand people are busy and have lives, and I hope you understand the same. While I may ask when you'll respond, it's more out of genuine interest, not pushiness. I'm fine waiting hours, days, weeks, or even months, as long as I'm told.
3. I'm picky with writing styles, I will say this now. I also am a fan of OOC chat, about our OCS, about our lives, and so on. If you have questions, ask them! Don't be afraid to ask me things, or for clarification, I'm not going to bite your head off for it <3
4. I'm a freelance artist. That being said, I can draw both OCs, as concept and such, if needed, if you're like me and like making new OCs for RPs. That being said, again, this is NOT a promise they'll be drawn, this is a flat-out MAYBE.

1q9uk7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/derealization/comments/1q9uk7z/antipsychotic_recovery/,Antipsychotic Recovery,"I used to be on antipsychotics; paliperidone and haloperidol. The symptoms are; restlessness, anhedonia, derealization, weakness, slow thinking. These symptoms were induced by these medications, which I don’t take anymore. This is my recovery after stopping the medications, and some tips. Restlessness was very difficult at the beginning, I could not sit still for 5-10 seconds, it was horrible, the feeling can literally compare to crawling out of the skin, but it got better, after a few months but still is present. Anhedonia was pretty bad too, barely no emotions at the beginning of recovery, a few months later (10), I have frequent emotional waves (crying/sadness/hurt/guilt), every 1-3 days, emotional waves often present themselves when in active recovery that’s how the brain heals. Happy/ exited/nostalgic will come later down the line. Derealization is the hardest, the feeling that you live in a simulation, are inorganic, feel “high”, or not real, is just your brain in fight body, it will pass. But is really distressing and scary, meditation helps. Weakness is often present after the body/brain/mind is exhausted after an emotional waves/ emotional release, is not dangerous. Slow thinking has to do with less dopamine, it’s going to get better. There definitely is hope. All of these symptoms have one thing in common; dopamine/seratonin. Antipsychotics antagonize dopamine/ seratonin and other neurotransmitters, and mess with brain in general. So it takes a long time for your brain to recover, for you to feel normal again, full emotions, no derealization, no brain fog, no restlessness, no weakness, no slow thinking. Generally it takes on average of 2-3 years after antipsychotics for the brain to regenerate. Our brains have high neuroplasticity, even better if you are below 30 years of age. Some of the stuff that I found helpful would include; Omega 3, Vitamin D, Magnesium - these are the most important. Others include vitamin C, Iron. Zinc, L-theanine,  ashwagandha, L-tyrosine. Other important notes are; limit coffee and cigarettes intake. Avoid alcohol and THC, so on. Get good sleep, protein, Eat healthy, exercise moderately, Electrolytes, also hydrate enough- 2 liters daily, if you are feeling weak I read that Salt/Sodium helps. One last thing, IQ can decrease temporarily unfortunately by 5-15 points. So for example if you scored 140 before antipsychotics, the estimated range now is around 127 more or less, after antipsychotics that will jump back up to 140 IQ. Speaking from pure experience. I would answer any questions. There is hope. You will recover. This can feel really scary, but it will pass, we are all in this together. :)",2,1768121604.0,derealization,0,1.0,False
1q9ujzq,https://v.redd.it/98hlcnn6iocg1,True Back Relief by Lifting - Lumoo Chair,"[The world's first true lumbar decompression chair, designed specifically for sedentary people](). 

[  ]()Lumbar Decompression of Up to 20KG  
Reduces 30%-50% of lumbar pressure. ( Adjust the exoskeletal armrests upward via a mobile app or buttons; the higher the adjustment, the greater the support. Maximum support is 20KG. Typically, the weight above the lumbar spine is about 50% of body weight. For a 70KG person, the upper body weighs approximately 35KG. Supporting 10KG reduces about 1/3 of the pressure; supporting 20KG reduces about 57% of the pressure.)

  Adapts to Different Body Types  
The spring-loaded mechanical arms are flexible and can be adjusted to fit various body shapes (different shoulder widths and sizes). Two chair height options are designed to accommodate heights from 155cm to 195cm.

  Basic Operations  
Both buttons and the mobile app allow the following: Tighten/relax to fit your body shape; raise/lower for optimal support strength (app displays real-time support force); recline/lean forward (recline button adjusts up to 135 degrees).

  Timed Reminder  
Set a timer on the app, and the armrest vibrates to remind you to take breaks, preventing prolonged sitting. Recommended timer setting is 40 minutes. Take short breaks, grab a coffee, or walk to maintain optimal lumbar health.

  Comfort  
For comfort during support, all contact points are made of springs and high-resilience foam, with a large contact area of 1,650 cm². (For 16.5KG of support, the pressure is 10g/cm², about 1/3 the pressure of fingers on a keyboard.)

  Smart Up-Armrest Design  
Ensures unobstructed computer operation while continuously supporting your arms, reducing lumbar pressure.

  Convenience  
Easy entry and exit: manually pull the arms apart to sit, and simply get up to exit.

This is Episode 2: No One Named ""Kenji Morita"" of my original anime project.

\[ Scene 1: At home \] ‒ Time: 11 : 40 pm

Akari sitting on the couch reading ""Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World"" a book by Haruki Murakami, on a shelf beside him a cup of coffee.

Akari: ""is what that driver said actually real? I cant find a logical explanation though...""

takes a sip of the coffee.

Akari: ""In that incident there wasn't much blood on the ground. Maybe the victim is still alive.""

11 : 50 pm

Akari closes the book and opens the T.V.

Akari checking the watch: ""I guess its almost time. 10 minutes.""

T.V. News: ""The driver ,Kenji Morita, who was involved into yesterday's incident was interrogated by the police. Kenji Morita claims that he doesn't remember driving at this late and he gets a headache whenever trying to remember the incident...""

Akari closes the T.V.

Akari serious look: ""wait what?""

Akari stands up, wears his coat and rushes leaving the house. The T.V. opens again.

\[ Scene 2: The police station \] ‒ Time: 11: 55

2 cops talking in the hallway, outside the interrogation room.

Cop1 scratching his head in confusion: ""man, this driver just needs a therapist at this point""

Cop2: ""yeah, he was probably drunk or something!""

Cop1 laughing: ""yeah I agree!""

Cop2: ""or maybe he was just lying!""

a cop leaving the interrogation room with a serious face.

Cop3: ""If he was lying or needed a therapist then Akari wouldn't have taken this case seriously. There is something wrong going on.""

Cop2: ""do you actually believe that guy? Like how can someone glitch out of reality thats so illogical!""

Cop1: ""Yeah. Also just so you know detective Akari believes that there is always a logical explanation so he is probably searching for clues now.""

Akari asks: ""Where is the interrogation room?""

Cop2: ""speak of the devil..""

Cop1: ""Why are you here?""

Akari: ""I am here because I am a detective and my job is to investigate. Now can you tell me where is the interrogation room?""

Cop3 pointing at the room behind him: ""here. We asked him, he just cant remember anything about the incident.""

Akari enters the room.

Akari: ""Kenji-san, don't you remember telling me that you saw the guy glitch?!""

Kenji: ""I..I don't remember..I barely recognize you..""

Akari talking to the cop beside him: ""did anything happen made him lose his memory?""

Cop4: ""No. There is nothing wrong with his brain. We sent him to a doctor, he said its all fine.""

Akari checks the watch, its 11:59 pm.

Akari: ""its almost midnight..""

Kenji: ""sorry, but I dont remember anything related to this incident. I remember what happened before it though.""

Akari: ""what happened? What can you remember exactly?""

Kenji: ""I remember heading ho‒""

Kenji starts glitching out then suddenly he disappears. Akari and Cop4 was shocked for a moment, then there shocked expressions slowly fades.

Akari: ""wh.what? I.I remember there was someone sitting in front of me just now on that chair..""

Cop4: ""Yes. I think..was there?..Someone..?""

Akari: ""Yes. There was! A guy sat infront of us here! He was going to say something! Then he suddenly disappeared! Don't you remember?""

Cop4: ""Who are you talking about? Sir, there was no one here.""

Akari: ""th.there was..what did just happen?""

Cop4: ""Sir, can you leave the room? You shouldn't be here.""

Akari leaves the room and asks the 3 cops who where still standing and chatting outside the room.

Akari: ""Hey, wasnt there someone inside just now? I don't remember his name but there was someone inside this room, we where interrogating, right?""

Cop2: ""What are you talking about? There was only you and the other cop inside""

Akari heads back home

\[ Scene 3: At home \] ‒ 12: 05 am

Akari enters home and finds the T.V. on, he closes it.

Akari: ""I remember closing this before leaving though..do I?""

Akari gets a notebook and writes down:

""there was someone in the interrogation room, he said ""I remember heading ho‒"" then just glitched out..I need to investigate this case.""

Then lays down on bed, staring at the ceiling.

Akari: ""I guess..I cant find a logical explanation for this..but i would never give up..""

then he falls asleep.

After credits...

\[ Scene 4: At home \]

Akari waking up..

Akari: ""Why did I stay awake till midnight yesterday again?""

We get all types but yesterday was something else.

This woman (maybe late 50s, very put together, expensive looking clothes) ordered a large latte and two pastries. Total came to $12.50. She smiled at me and said ""I'll pay you with a blessing today.""

I thought she was joking and laughed but she was serious. She put her hands together like praying and said some kind of blessing over me about prosperity and health. Then she reached for her order.

I said ""um ma'am that's nice but I still need payment for the items."" She looked offended and said ""I just GAVE you payment, a blessing is worth more than money."" I explained that's not how this works and she needs to pay actual money.

She got really huffy and said ""I'm a woman of faith and my blessings have real value, you should be grateful."" I just stood there holding her order like... what do I even say? My manager came over and she told him I was being ""spiritually closed minded"" and ""discriminating against her religion."" My manager politely said she still needs to pay with money or card. She said this was ""disgraceful"" and that our coffee shop is ""going to fail because we reject blessings."" She left in a huff saying she'd never come back (thank god).

I love hunting down gins from all over the world, but lately, the Indian scene has been stealing the show. I’m sharing my top domestic picks for your shelf. 

Disclaimer: I’m no sommelier analyzing botanical nuances- I’m just a late-20s guy who loves a crisp, citrusy refresher without the pretension. My international collection is decent, but Indian gins are currently winning. Here’s the list.

# 

**Greater Than brand**

**Greater Than Punk Gin**\- Good strawberry kick along with high citrus taste. This i would totally recommend. Sadly this one's a limited edition

https://preview.redd.it/vnfifs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4065fc72f8c78df7d85fa991cbce280f108e7a2

  
**Greater Than Gin**\- Simple gin. Good for cocktails and has healthy ingredients I felt(Not a bad hangover in any manner). 

https://preview.redd.it/jggrvs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8e9c2a831f76a1993ab2b9b95b05f5ca79c35fc

  
**Greater Than No Sleep Gin**\- The coffee taste is remarkable! With high tonic mix this actually tastes like Subko Float/Cola Float. Definitely would not recommend this one at late nights. Sadly this was also limited edition. 

https://preview.redd.it/qox7qs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb8d1e721b9304cce66be51dd9768da521c22a0c

**Greater Than Kashmir Willow Gin**\- The color is distinct but tbh didn't feel this to be lot different than the usual Greater Than. That said, this one was also a limited edition one. I don't have a real bottle picture as finished this one in a day :')

https://preview.redd.it/84z2ezl0iicg1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=09a7952736462f9a35421d2a71cf73fec0f75edb

**Stranger and Sons Gins:** I have only owned one and always loved it, hence sharing.

**Stranger and Sons Perry Road Peru**\- You can definitely feel the guava flavour in this gin. Comes with a spice packet which you can add for added flavour. This one is really flavourful and I often restock it.

https://preview.redd.it/1r450t42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0e1955c2fc3f01406ad1dc93839415b3de8f102

**Blue Moon Gin**\- Expensive Greater Than. This one's highly priced but honestly, I didn't find this to be great in any manner.

https://preview.redd.it/1uhurs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a234461505b7ea32408bdc173c3c4494181ada4

  
**Oregin Gin**\- Similar to any normal gin tbh. Priced at a great price-point. 

https://preview.redd.it/6rpvas42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5d9f685a632b7da4914425517ff1c2a7e59ddc3

  
**Jaisalmer Gin-** Perhaps one of the most recognized gins in India. This one has a great citrus flavour. Also the bottle feels really sturdy. Definitely recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/09iiqs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=966fe4981eb813940cdfb6a9ec98c74747fcbbbf

  
**Samsara Family**

**Samsara Elderflower and Lemon-** The Elderflower taste is definietely there in the gin. Aptly priced as well. Would recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/vixeur42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2202754eb604c18c92968e4fa1d346b75f72467

  
**Samsara Grapefruit and Rose-** Quite tangy. Also a great one. Would definitely recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/69ubqs42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cff7c0229ebfe55ad90fd4d3030715afd84b825d

There are other Samsara gins as well including Coffee and Hazelnut which you should also try to get your hands on.

**Doja Gin-** Roku of India. This gin has the typical Roku flavour at half the price. Also the bottle looks slick! Would recommend

https://preview.redd.it/0d3fas42iicg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3661fd61d03c1d959e41f8b35bbe37d59fb80183

**Cherrapunji Gin-** Perhaps one of the rarest brands. Absolutely love their bottle which is made of steel. Also the flavour is nice, this tastes tangy, would place similar to Doja. Would recommend.

https://preview.redd.it/lv7jrs42iicg1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37a6428740b0734e104765a33fe5bbb735d3191a

There are few others I own but got tired of clicking pictures:  
**Baagh Gin-** Bottle looks great for your bar. The taste is a little orange-ish side. would recommend

  
**Terai Gin-** Carries a heavy fenil seed flavour. I couldn't savour the taste that well. Won't recommend from my side.

  
**Gin Gin-** Normal gin but really great price point and calls itself the clearest gin of India. Would recommend.",3,1768121242.0,Gin,1,1.0,False

The Bramblewood stretched across the land where darkness and light existed side by side, shaping an atmosphere of quiet mystery. It was spoken of as an endless labyrinth, not because it had no borders, but because no one ever seemed able to see it whole. The forest felt alive, its presence carrying a low tension that lingered over hidden paths and forgotten corners.

In many places, thorny undergrowth and deep, cold moss pressed close together. Conifers and oaks competed for space as dense thickets slowed every step. Light struggled to filter through the thick green canopy overhead, breaking apart before it reached the ground.

Farther in, the forest shifted. Bright groves opened beneath thinning branches, sunlight warming the earth and softening the ground underfoot. For brief moments, the Bramblewood loosened its grip, allowing the sound of leaves in the wind to return.

Beyond these pockets of light, the land widened and narrowed again in slow rhythm. Open stretches gave way to shadow, streams threaded through the forest floor, and still lakes lay hidden deeper within, reflecting the sky with an uneasy calm. Mountains enclosed the Bramblewood on all sides, white limestone rising to the east, green ridges holding firm to the north.

At the forest’s heart, movement grew difficult. Thorned growth thickened, shadows gathered, and silence pressed in until even breath felt out of place. The Bramblewood seemed aware here, listening, waiting. Mist drifted between the trees, low to the ground or high among the branches, and the soil lay heavy with damp decay. Footprints faded quickly. Nothing was meant to linger.

Sometimes, faint red tones flickered through the gloom. Like small flames glimpsed and gone again, they lit parts of the forest just long enough to feel wrong. The contrast carried a quiet warning that something dark lay hidden beneath the roots. Every step through the tangled undergrowth sharpened the senses, turning sound and shadow into signs.

At the center of the dense Bramblewood stood a village, a sharp contrast to its surroundings. Where the forest pressed close with shadow and mystery, the village radiated warmth and life. Colorful houses lined narrow streets, their facades decorated with careful woodwork and window boxes overflowing with flowers. Laughter drifted through the air as people moved between cafés and bakeries, the scent of fresh bread and coffee inviting visitors to slow down and stay awhile.

Yet beneath the warmth lingered something quieter. Even in moments of joy, a shadow of sorrow could sometimes be seen in passing glances. The village carried a shared grief, an invisible weight resting beneath the surface. In the spaces between buildings, hints of red appeared, small flashes woven into stone and decoration, reminders that the forest had not fully let go.

At the edge of the village, where the Bramblewood met open ground, stood a small house.

It rested in a shallow clearing, modest in size and easy to miss unless one knew where to look. Wild grapevines climbed its walls and curled around windows and doors, their deep green leaves dotted with small red buds. A stone path led through a carefully tended garden to the front door. Orange trees grew in one corner, their glossy fruit bright against the greenery, the scent of blossoms lingering softly in the air. Painted in warm earth tones, the house felt calm and unassuming, set apart from both forest and village.

A solitary figure lived there.

From time to time, villagers glimpsed the lone inhabitant by the window, absorbed in books or lost in thought. The house was not spoken of with fear, but with quiet respect. It became a symbol of solitude, different from the sorrow that lingered elsewhere in the village. A place for reflection. A still point between the Bramblewood and the lives unfolding nearby.

When night fell, mist rolled in from the forest and settled over the village like a soft veil, whispering of secrets and hidden forces waiting to be uncovered. The Bramblewood seemed to hold its breath, as if something vast and unknown was drawing closer.

I delivered one cold coffee at 11:30 PM.

After climbing 4 floors, fighting one security guard, two locked gates, and Google Maps’ creative writing, I finally delivered it.

Mission accomplished.

Then I made a mistake.

I thought: “Let me have chai.”

Checked my account: ₹0.

UPI said: Insufficient balance but sufficient audacity.

So I called and said, very politely:
“Madam, can you give ₹5 tip? I’ll do 5+5 and drink chai.”

She went silent.

Probably informing:

• Zomato HQ
• RBI
• CBI
• Reddit moderators

In 5 minutes, my ₹5 request became:

• A possible scam
• A social experiment
• A psychological thriller
• A 900-word Reddit post

For the record:

I did not: ❌ Ask for ₹50
❌ Ask for ₹100
❌ Ask for her property papers

I asked for ₹5.

Anyway, I’m still thirsty.
But at least now I’m famous on Reddit.

I wasn’t sure if I was ready for anything serious or long-term. But after a while, I realized that it is consistency. I want something genuine, getting to know each other’s favorite food, interests, and even everyday struggles. I want to get to know someone deeply and start off from there. 

For some context: 

•I’m 23, 5’3, and a morena

•Grad from the green school

•Living in QC 

•Working in corpo (to which I need a life outside of)

•A big foodie

•Likes sleeping in and spending quality time

•A yapper who always has something to say (😅)

Preferences:

•Hopefully around 23-28 years old

•From QC also or somewhere nearby (so we can grab food or coffee after a long day)

•Someone consistent and looking for something serious

1q9u45t,https://i.redd.it/2gjaa18dgocg1.jpeg,Another Falling Loves page- Chester's death,"This post goes with my previous post, but this is where Samantha Bennington was alerted of his death, and the only weird thing she claims was odd about the early morning of July 20th in 2017.

So, why I think Samantha may be suspicious; It's her storytelling, the money comment, her narrative that she and Chester were besties, though there is really no evidence of that, just her word. Other than him thanking her for helping him, back on Valentines Day in 2011, but who truly knows the true nature of their relationship.

So, a few things to think about:

1. Samantha leaving her car in South Bay, staying with a buddy who may or may not live in the Palos Verdes area, based on context clues.
2. Why didn't she call home to ensure everything was alright, when she awoke in the middle of the night feeling panicked and needing to go home?
3. Why was she in Palos Verdes, near Chester's street, at all? And, when she was going by that he was in Sedona (Arizona), on a trip with his family?
4. Why was she really possibly speeding down down the streets? Why the rush, yet not chancing to contact Jay (to make sure everything was fine at home), who was staying with her and Draven during that time? ESPECIALLY when you are roughly an hour away from home??
5. What was she doing between 2-6 in the morning, since she got up at around 7am (she ensured to make note she always gets up early, and that she was wide awake and bubbly)?
6. Let's say, theoretically-speaking, she didn't want her car spotted at his house (she claimed she was tipsy)...well, why would she not want to have it around?
7. Why didn't Samantha question Chester being at home, dead, when she made it clear in her memoir that he was still in Sedona?
8. Why did Samantha not contact Talinda, to verify whether or not Chester being dead was true?
9. What prompted Samantha to say that Chester being worth more money dead than alive, is a motive (Studio 10 interview on YouTube)? That's the first thing she thought of? Only thing? Or, is it that she is possibly telling on them? I say ""them"", because...I don't solely peg Samantha as being the only possible guilty person, because Chester's widow and colleagues, his friends (some of those people) are weird.
10. If Chester was in Sedona, according to Samantha's knowledge and narrative of that time, in her memoir...she virtually had no real rhyme or reason to be near Chester's house, the same early morning where he would have died (which, again, I feel pretty certain he was murdered).
11. The most detailed aspect of her memoir, I'd argue, is the time of his death. Other things, she kinda touches upon them. But, I mean when getting down to the nitty-gritty details, almost... like I said in my previous post, Samantha devotes a good chunk of her book to the aftermath of his death, around the time of his death. I wonder what her memoir was like, BEFORE Chester died.",1,1768119925.0,chesterbennington,1,0.6,False

about me: early 20s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too 🪝-up-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m about:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk, i love hearing how things... and people... work.

deep talks > small talk, tell me about your passions, not just your day

not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills

what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

beyond that, consistency and matched energy are HUGE for me. I'm looking for someone whose actions actually line up with their words. If you're a clear communicator who believes in showing up, not just showing interest, we'll get along great

and a quick heads-up on my communication style:

im a very direct person because I value clarity and honesty above everything. you can expect me to ask real questions early on, because I'm here to build a genuine connection, not just stay in shallow small talk. It's never to be uncomfortable, but always to be clear.

i’d rather hear ""hey this isn't a vibe"" than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion. let's RESPECT each other's time.

but also, if you're someone who just drops a ""hey"", trades a few surface-level messages, and bails before even trying to know the person, please don't bother texting. at that point, saying ""this isn't a vibe"" is just lazy, because you haven't even understood the words yet, let alone the vibe. i'm not here to be someone's pass-time or validation hit. i value real effort, real curiosity, and actual presence. if you can’t bring that, it’s perfectly okay... but this space isn’t for you.

ambiguity is fine, but only when it's honest. An upfront ""hey, I'm not sure yet"" is a thousand times better than mixed signals or a slow fade. i'll always give you that same respect and directness in return... overall, i’m not here to impress, i’m here to express

so, if you've actually read this far and you're on the same page, please send a DM. I'm not against 'hi', but to show you get the vibe, please skip the intro and instead tell me two things: your ideal lazy weekend, and one song you've had on repeat lately this will let me know that you actually read the entire post.
