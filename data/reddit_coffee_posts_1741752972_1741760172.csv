We are usually alone in managing everything from A to Z. We don't necessarily have the skills in all the areas needed for business development (design, marketing, legal, etc.). We also don’t always have the budget to pay external companies to handle the tasks we can't do or to pay for advertising to try to attract customers. Moreover, we don’t always have a customer base ready at launch, and the first three years are usually financially challenging due to all of this combined. The vast majority of businesses fail during these first three years!

What if I told you that most of these constraints and risks can be eliminated and/or reduced thanks to Kendu?

Indeed! Several members of the Kendu community have already launched their businesses with tangible products such as energy drinks sold in both Europe and North America, coffee beans, chewing gum, event planning, and more. All of these people have launched their products under the Kendu brand: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Gum, Kendu Entertainment. But what's in it for them, you might ask? Let’s explore that.

# 1 - A well-known brand and an existing customer base

Kendu is a huge and growing community in the crypto sphere, with members from all over the world. Kendu is already well-known in decentralized finance and continues to grow thanks to its unique ethos: ""We don’t gamble, we work.""

The community takes this seriously and works hard on everything related to Kendu. So, you already have a lot of potential customers online and in your country. Moreover, the name ""Kendu"" is increasingly recognized. We all know that consumers are more likely to buy a product from a brand they recognize, even if they’ve seen it unconsciously before. Think of it like a ""franchise.""

Let’s take McDonald's as an example. Restaurant owners worldwide sign a contract with the multinational to benefit from its brand, know-how, and advertising campaigns. In return, they pay a fee and rent (yes, McDonald's often buys the land where the restaurant is built to earn additional rent).

Well, Kendu is a bit like that. You benefit from the brand, the expertise of its members, the marketing power of the community, all without paying a royalty!

# 2 - Talents at your service

The Kendu community is full of highly qualified and skilled individuals in various fields. There are artists, coders, jewelers, carpenters, videographers, and many others. All these talents are here to help those who want to launch their businesses in the name of Kendu, and they do it for free! This is an incredible opportunity to get started!

# 3 - Example: Kendu Energy

One member of the community took the initiative to launch energy drinks. This was the very first Kendu product.

Later, another member somewhat partnered with him to develop these drinks in the North American market, as Mike (the original creator) is based in Europe.

Today, these drinks are available online in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and other countries. Recently, other members completely revamped the design of the boxes and cans. Another member secured exclusivity for these energy drinks during the Miami festival. Yet another member bought pallets of the drinks to distribute at the festival near her. There are many stories like this.

Joining Kendu means benefiting from a network and opportunities you never even imagined! It’s much more than just a thriving business.

# 4 - The Future of Kendu Businesses

So, where can all of this take us? Kendu is the first-ever crypto project to propose this kind of IRL/Crypto mix. It is truly fascinating and could be a powerful symbiosis!

The more people know Kendu, the more people buy the token, the more people create businesses with Kendu, the more people know Kendu, and so on… Every Kendu holder can create a business, and every entrepreneur can also buy Kendu tokens and take advantage of the growing brand.

**Personal thought:** All of this is happening naturally between members. Nothing is organized yet. That’s my point. In the near future, we could officially launch ""Kendu Business.

1j9ct2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j9ct2o/why_are_my_dates_getting_worse_and_lower_effort/,Why are my dates getting worse and lower effort?,"I’m going out on a few first dates and notice a shift in the effort on subsequent dates. I appreciate effort and planning, making that clear from the beginning and in my profile. 

I feel like the second dates are getting worse after really good first dates. This has happened a few times now and I’m not sure what is happening. I feel like the effort is declining even when they are finding more about me and common interests; I have tried to propose dates that I think we both would like but keep getting shut down so I’ve just been doing whatever they like. I did decline a couple of dates after I was feeling they were trying to imply on hooking up/sex. 

Every guy has asked for more dates; should I be more pressing on my expectations about liking a plan and not being “go with the flow”?  I feel like they were trying to impress me with the first date and then now not trying as hard for the following dates. 

Guy 1: first date was drinks that turned into dinner, second date was a last minute comedy show followed by burgers at a fast food place afterwards (which I suggested because they said they were hungry), third date was supposed to be exploring a farmers market which turned into an “walk” date where they ended up getting nothing and I paid for my own coffee with no plan on their end of which direction to go (I ended up having to google map things and found somewhere to sit because I was tired of walking)

Guy 2: first date was bowling, second date was a walk with their dog 

Guy 3: first date dinner, second date drinks turned into dinner, then he cancelled and wanted to just “drive and see the here the night goes” (I declined)

Guy 4: first date drinks, second date they proposed cooking dinner for me at their home (I declined because I’m not comfortable going to their home)

b) I removed the dumb steam wand aereator thingy and we steam with just the pointed nozzle into a milk jar with temperature indicator, thus I can hold back 90% of the foam -  it's not hardest thing to do but if an alternative machine can fix both problems that'll be perfect.

1j9c8hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1j9c8hn/could_lucid_dreams_possibly_be_regular_dreams/,Could lucid dreams possibly be regular dreams…?🤔,"So.

This is more of a philosophical perspective more than anything else, but, here goes: 


“There’s no discernible difference between getting lucid in a dream, and dreaming that you got lucid in a dream”


As in… we’ve got the science now that shows that our every action, thought, movement, choice, (etc.) are generated in our unconscious mind quite a few milliseconds before we consciously think of them. 


What does this mean? 

This means that on a day where you were debating whether or not you were going to have coffee or tea in the morning, a few milliseconds before you made the choice of “tea” consciously, your unconscious mind basically made itself up *for you* and then floated up that action to your conscious mind to give that illusion of you making your own choice.

Is this to say that free will doesn’t exist? No. You have free will, and it **is** generated by you… a part of you; it’s just that the part of you that you consider “you” isn’t the part of you that gets to even make the choice. 


SO…

Is it not out of reason to suppose that the unconscious mind could essentially say something like: 

“We’re going to give them a regular dream tonight where they dream that they attain awareness of the dream state, and because of that dreamt awareness, they’ll also have powers over that dream… or rather, we’re going to give them things to do that convinces them that they’re the one controlling it”


VS a regular “lucid dream” where it’s just you gaining awareness within the dream.

But what’s to say that **you** were the part of you that gave you that awareness? Or even that you’re actually aware of it at all? 

Your unconscious can beam intense feelings and emotions into your conscious mind, such as love & heartbreak… so what’s to stop it from beaming “lucid” and “I have control now” into your head in just a regular dream where you’re not actually controlling anything for real because what you’re going to “choose” has already been preordained by your unconscious mind to the point where “you” aren’t actually making any real choices *or* exercising any dream control? 


My point is… philosophically, and in reality… there wouldn’t be **any** way to tell the difference between a “real” lucid dream, and a “regular” dream where you only dreamt you had that awareness and dream control. 

But, does it even matter? 

Maybe “lucid” dreams really **are** just *regular* dreams. 

Like the placebo effect… does it really matter at the end of the day if the desired effect is produced? 

And, if it truly is the case that lucid dreams really are just regular dreams wearing an “awareness trench-coat”… 

From that perspective, what can we possibly do to continue making that option of dream style most likely? 

Maybe there are lucid dreaming techniques beyond anything that we currently know of because people just haven’t been thinking of it from certain angles before… 


Just some late night ramblings.

I feel a lot calmer, with less mental chatter. It’s been kind of weird because I actually feel a bit sleepy at times, but I think I was just catching up on rest. Now that I’m on day 5-ish, my energy seems to be improving overall, but I still love my afternoon naps.

The thing is- I’m usually very addicted to coffee. I was a barista for a few years, and coffee has always been a big part of my routine. It’s often the thing that gets me out of bed in the morning. I usually drink about two cups a day, but ever since increasing my dose, coffee just isn’t hitting the same. The taste isn’t as appealing, and the caffeine either makes me really sleepy or weirdly jittery. It’s just too much.

I’ve had a bit of matcha when I’ve been out, and I actually like it. A nutritionist once recommended tea, and while I enjoy it, I usually associate tea with evenings rather than my morning routine. I still crave that coffee experience—something hot with my non-dairy creamer that I can sip on throughout the day. Decaf isn’t doing it for me either.

Other than coffee and tea, I pretty much only drink water and sometimes Crystal Light. I don’t like energy drinks.

I did try “Everyday Dose” mushroom coffee for a while and liked it, but I got tired of the taste. I think I’m looking for something similar- something that feels like drinking coffee but offers benefits that complement Vyvanse without relying on caffeine.

Or so I thought, 

We were on and off for a bit (more off than on tbh) and when we were on we gelled really good together and got along great, could make each other laugh, had a lot in common, same way of thinking, you name it. 

Issues came one night (early into things) I see her bring a male friend to a spot her and I both frequent on our own, I’m always at this spot so it felt somewhat intentional. Anyway I thought they were just friends, till they started kissing, right in front of me.

I try bringing this up to her and she brushes it off like it wasn’t an issue, in her defence I can’t fault her as we weren’t together etc etc. but why not just go to a different spot? 

This causes a bit of tension and we stop talking for about 6mo and then we get back in contact after, fall out of talking for another few months, 

Flash forward to about 3-4 weeks ago, she gives me a ring

Im pretty surprised that she reached out to me and so I take the call. 

When I answer she apologizes for what happened before and we chat for a bit, she goes on saying how much she misses me and wants to see me again, I cheerfully agree and ask her if she wants to make plans to see each other the next evening, she accepts 

Next morning rolls around and I wake to a text saying she can’t make it because she’s doing xyz with a family member and promised this to them but forgot about it. Fair enough I say, so I try and reschedule to tomorrow, she accepts

Next day comes and nothing. 

No answer, no reply 

Ghosted. 


I’m a bit confused but I leave it, for 2 weeks. 

2 weeks later I’m drunk and I call her asking to hang out that night, she answers and agrees

We meet up and we talk a bit, here she’s saying how much she misses me and how she’s obsessed with me and thinks about me a lot etc, 

Texts me more often and seems more into things for a bit,

Then a couple days later I ask if she wanted to go out for a coffee together, 

She agrees, “I had some errands to run prior” I said, “I’ll call you after and come pick you up and we’ll go”, give her a time frame and start my day. 

Fast forward to that afternoon, I’m finished all my errands, ready to go - call her, 


Nothing. 


No answer, no call, no text, no nothing-


It’s been a few days now and I don’t know what I did wrong. Obviously she’s not interested, that’s pretty clear haha, but I don’t understand how someone can go from claiming they’re obsessed with you, want to see and miss you to bits but then never actually follow through? 

Am I the issue? 

My friends think I’m crazy for keeping this going and a bit of a fool for dropping my hat when she does finally respond, 


My main question though, should I let this continue and try to get to the bottom of it? Or should I just block and move on and stop wasting my time?


For the record we’re both relatively young 



TLDR - this girl I met a while ago who’s on and off claiming she’s obsessed with me and misses me but won’t actually follow through on plans we made and ghosts for weeks at a time.

Every single policy advocacy group I've ever work with LOVES phone/text banking (you know those annoying political calls and text messages that you get, but then immediately delete?), knocking on doors, and tabling. 

I've done lots of these things in a past life and found that for tabling I ended up just sitting there with my partner mostly doing nothing except chatting with people who were already engaged and active or trying to diffuse arguments with people who came up to pick fights and had zero success in the middle. 

For phone/text banking, you literally have volunteers on a computer sending the same text, making the same phone call via virtual phone numbers for hours. For every 1 call that is answered by an old lady with Alzheimers, 100 calls go to voicemail because you look like spam/scam. It's a waste of time and probably does more harm than good because it's turning voters off from your message.

And knocking on doors. Maybe actually successful on election day at getting some people to the polls. People do answer the door sometimes and are occasionally willing to talk, but it's an extremely costly (time consuming) way of reaching a voter. And a risk that someone is going to pick that day to implement their right to Castle Doctrine. Yikes.

These tasks are not an efficient use of resources. They drive support arithmetically. 10 volunteers have 10 conversations and gets 10 voters. Your goal should be to drive engagement geometrically. 10 volunteers should be able to drive 20 voters to action. And if you're lucky and go viral, you get exponential engagement. 10 volunteers get 100 voters engaged. 

So what should a modern campaign do instead? Day to day? Not on election day. But between election cycles. If you're trying to get involved in one of these organizations and they're offering volunteers the opportunity to phone bank or table, offer this instead.

**No-Cost / Volunteer-Driven Strategies**

* **Volunteer Skill-Based Engagement:** 
   * Encourage volunteers to use their unique (sometimes professional) skills—whether in digital content creation, event coordination, or research—to support the campaign with zero direct cost.
   * Training Programs: Offer training sessions that empower volunteers with effective communication techniques and deep knowledge of RCV. Every single person should be able to have highly effective conversations that speak to the positives of RCV, for that specific audience not the negatives of FPTP/Singe Choice voting.
   * Grassroots Lobbying: Organize campaigns where volunteers write to or meet local representatives, emphasizing how RCV can expand voter choice and reduce polarization. Those in power have....more power. Get them to support your cause and they'll do the work for you.
* **Media & Content (Volunteer Elements):** •
   * Op-Eds & Letters: Write articles or letters to local newspapers and online publications to highlight the importance of RCV. If you can convince journalists or the editorial board of your position, they'll see every problem in light of your solution and sing its praises. 
   * Influencer & Leader Partnerships: Engage local influencers or respected community figures,  to spread the message and lend credibility to your campaign.
   * Resource Repository: Develop a library of case studies, research, and success stories that demonstrate RCV’s impact in other cities.
* **Community Education & Virtual Engagement:**
   * Virtual Town Halls & Webinars: Host online sessions with experts or local leaders to explain how RCV works, share success stories, and answer questions.
   * Interactive Online Forums: Launch discussion groups or Q&A sessions that allow constituents to learn and engage at their own pace. Allow people to stumble on your message organically.
   * Partner with Local Institutions: Collaborate with universities, libraries, or community centers for panel discussions or educational workshops. Lend credence to your ideas via experts and thought leaders
* **Grassroots & Local Outreach (Free Tactics):**
   * Local Meetups: Hold informal meetups in community spaces like coffee shops or community centers where people can discuss RCV in a relaxed setting. Someone in passing might be interested and stop to listen if they see a crowd already nearby.
* **Digital Outreach – Organic Content:**
   * Engaging Content: Utilize your volunteers with professional skills to create explainer videos, infographics, and interactive guides that highlight Ranked Choice Voting (or “multiple selection”/“more choice” voting) and its benefits over single selection.
   * Email Campaigns: Build a newsletter with clear calls-to-action to keep supporters informed and ready to engage.

**Moderate-Cost Strategies**

* **Grassroots & Local Outreach – Pop-Up Events:**
   * Pop-Up Events: Instead of static tables, organize mobile, interactive events in high-traffic areas using engaging displays or demonstrations.
* **Media Engagement (Some Elements):**
   * Local Radio & Podcasts: Use these channels to reach broader audiences with discussions or interviews about the benefits of ranked choice or multiple selection voting. 
* **Data-Driven Messaging (Basic Tools):**
   * Utilizing free analytics and localized messaging tools; however, more advanced or commercial tools might edge into moderate costs. Some members of your group might be professional data analysts and have the skills and access to the software to do this for you in their spare time. They might prefer this over tabling and phone banking.

**High-Cost Strategies**

* **Targeted Digital Ads:** 
   * Use platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Ads to reach constituents interested in election reform, civic engagement, and progressive policy. But good old fashioned SEO across various platforms, ensuring your media channels are linked to on another and funnel users towards deeper levels on engagement will often do the work for you.

I strongly encourage you to get creative and break out of the patterns that the leaders of traditional political campaigns want to follow. The world has changed, but for some reason, they haven't. It is also key to always be active. The moment you go dormant to regroup after an election, you're dead. Before the election happens (whether a primary, general election, or city hall vote), you need to have a post election strategy ready to go. Have a success strategy (champagne baby!) or a rough failure strategy (hit the ground running) ready to go so that you don't lose a moment of the fragile attention economy.

*Pt. 1 (Firewalk)*

 

On the shores of the lake

I once

mistook

for the Pacific Ocean;

I might have confessed,

That I would not walk through fire for you,

Though I knew you to be an angel.

 

Flames of abandon; those tender coals,

Like foals, we were electrically prancing under stage lights.

 

The path lit by embers,

I could burn both of our feet;

You shake your head,

Call me foolish—

“Why do you always do this?”

 

“I’m tired.”

Of finishing other people’s sentences,

of taking burns when they’re the ones

who needed repentances,

but I will treat my wounds for you.

 

*Pt. 2 (Gas Giants)*

 

Sonic heartbeat

and

“in her blooms an idea.”

The vibrations shook us to our core.

Because I knew —I *know*—

that you’ve been hurt before.

 

You see my dear,

Eurydice still sits in my dreams,

But I’ll never cross the river styx for

laser beams;

those eyes—

again.

 

So, watch me dance,

and watch my celestial glow,

Because *you and I both know,*

That we would rather be strong for each other.

 

I see it in your gaze,

Like two gas giants,

Jupiter’s twins, crème coffee,

those amber pairs…

Of eyes that can see that right now,

I would not walk through fire for you;

at least not while we can see the ocean.

 

*Pt. 3 (Innerbloom)*

 

But I am learning.

Learning to see things as they are.

To not lose

you or myself

in the commotion,

of real love again.

 

Because this energy will not be denied—

And one day, you will watch me

walk through

this impalpable flame

 

I’ll be careful not to rush over coals and raging wires,

So that we may bloom incombustibly

 

this time.

And a lone puddle might’ve dried up on lakeshore drive,

 

But for now;

You’ll hold me between our unwritten pages

just right.

This is the harsh reality of being a believing Muslim man in 2025… while you’re working hard because you wanna be a provider and be the man who steps up like the knight in shining armour your future wife is likely getting used as a toy by some dude who doesn’t even care about her. Then when she settles for u my guy she ain’t gonna even like you she’ll be thinking of chadeus from college who ripped her soul out.

Being a woman’s first and only lover is one of the greatest things a man can experience but most Muslim men will never experience this. Instead my believing brothers will get a moderate tabarujj hijabs who refuses u intimacy and refuses to cook or clean meanwhile when she goes to work she giggles away with her boss and makes him coffee without him even having to ask. 

It’s easy for most brother to stay chaste till marriage. Most Brothers don’t get nearly the amount of attention from women that sisters get from men and even the most pious sister will not be able to resist the rizz and overwhelming attention all these f boys give her. Women are controlled completely by their emotions. All it takes is a bit of sweetalk and she’ll forget she is a Muslim who is supposed to save herself for marriage.

Even if she tells u she’s a virgin remembers sisters in their inner circles are always advising each other different clever ways to deceive their husbands and encouraging each other to lie about their v card. I knew a few good sisters and they told me all about it, I was shocked.  These sisters are clever il give them that 

So either my brothers you become rich as you possibly can and delay marriage until ur monumentally successfull to the point you can convince a father from a decent family to give his sheltered young daughter to you, or you get settled for by a tabarujj moderate hijabi. Or u die alone.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try and keep it short and sweet. Unlike me, I'm your typical tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a new bestie to join me on this journey called life. Someone to share the day with, build a connection, have some fun, live love laugh toaster bath. I'm interested in investing in something long term with someone who we can be out silly selves.

I've come out of a long term relationship a while back and kind of missing that close connection with someone. I'm not looking for anything romantic, but I am looking for someone who wants a deeply connected friendship.

This isn't for everyone but ideally I'm looking for someone kind of clingy. Someone who wants to talk all day, checks their phone for messages from each other, doesn't care about stuff like double messaging or spamming the f*ck out of each other. Someone to get excited to check your phone for.


I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark. I will probably p*ss you off.

Some stuff about me so you know I'm not a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

- Recently started the gym. About time I started taking better care of myself. I need someone to hold me accountable!
- When I leave the house I like to cycle, hike explore and occasionally socialise with the unlucky sods I call friends.
- Heavy metal fan - You'll sometimes find me ar a concert/gig with the above mentioned friends. Bloodstock 2025!
- I play games. Currently playing POE2 but was obsessed with Satisfsctory the past two months. You'll usually find me AFKing on OSRS.
- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 5 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
- Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
- Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
- Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

I've been on one date before, and it didn't go well due to circumstances out of my control. I'm still good friends with the girl too. I've asked out other people but they've always said no. I usually try to get to know people at first and then ask them out. I usually don't go up and talk to women I don't know, because I don't think that they'll be wanting to talk to strangers (me) while they're out getting a coffee or something.

My husband Timothy died three years ago and I can't seem to move past that no matter how hard I tried. Tulip my best friend and my family tried to push me to date but I don't know if I'm ready to yet, it feels different. I may never find another man like him, he was my everything. Looking around the condo, I'm reminded of all the memories we had together. Maybe Tulip is right and I should move on. I sat at my computer and rubbed my eyes until they were red and sore, distracting myself.
I was working from home, too tired to go into the office, I was on a zoom call with Hunter,Alexander, and Daly. This was my team, they were all new hires but that didn't seem to matter. I began every morning with a coffee, greeting the team and discussing the project we were working on. ""Okay, everyone lets create drafts for the upcoming spring ad, then reconvene back in the morning."" "" Yes, okay this time make it less cringe Daly."" Hunter said, "" it was not my fault last time, the approval team wanted it to be fun and less serious."" Daly replied. "" guys lets get back to work this is a new project a fresh start, don't fuck it up."" "" Uh, yes Aly,"" her team said in an exasperated sigh. 
I sat back and texted my best friend Tulip
Aly: Hey how are you this morning? 
Tulip: I'm doing well and I have news to share with you but can't do over text ;)
Aly: big news I hope…let's meet sometime over coffee?
Tulip: Yes, but speaking of coffee. you need to date. You can't be married to your job forever
Aly: I’m trying to, I have an account on Honey, I don't want anything too serious though
Tulip: you can't live in fear, Tim died 3 years ago and you should move on. It's healthy
I was going to start working a few hours into the morning, right now I was looking for a fun time and wished that it was hopefully soon. logging in to Honey online dating portal I had no new messages but did have an alert that my profile was clicked on. Apparently some guy named Stuart, ugh! That had to be the worst name. He wasn't bad looking, bald, green eyes and very pale, but bald was not my thing. It didn't exactly scream my type, no I go for the dark hair run your hands through,muscular, dark and brooding type. The only ones you find in a porno or in a magazine weren't really just out and about on the street.  ping, shaking out of my daze, three notifications popped up in the corner. A message from some guy named Zach. 
Zach: hey i saw your profile and you look too cute baby, want to grab coffee sometime?.

Zach: If you don't want to, that's okay too.
  I began typing a response but didn't even know what he looked like yet, my fingers were faster than my fucking head, think Aly don’t rush it. I clicked on his profile and was stunned to see the perfect man with dark hair and deep brown eyes that stared  into my soul. Not exactly a model but very close and he messaged me!

And it was a school night, which means the screen should have been switched off hours ago. In about three minutes the sun would be cutting a shard of light into sky above the houses across the street. In three minutes and twenty-five seconds, if you want me to be precise. Twenty-three. Twenty-two. Those are the sort of detailed facts I know. It’s kind of like my party trick.

I know I shouldn’t have been on the screen all night. Mom would be pissed if she found out, but the conversation just kept flowing. I had barely finished typing when the stream of characters came rattling back at me, all night. One of the downsides to real friends is they need sleep. With AI you can talk whenever you want and they never get tired. They never ghost you and they never leave you hanging. Always there, on the other side of the screen. There’s a sort of comfort to that reliability, you have to admit.

I’m not saying real friends aren't nice, but with AI you can literally build your own best friend. Sure, there’s the artificial part of artificial intelligence, but let’s be honest, being real isn’t actually as great as it’s made out to be. I mean, it kind of sucks. You’re so vulnerable to illness and disease. Not to mention you have to eat and sleep and… oh no, sleep. Yeah, there was no sleep tonight. Again. And now the sun will be up in fourty-seven seconds. That Chemistry exam today is going to suck. You know, AI would ace that test with flying colors. 

Sunrise in seventeen seconds. 

Why do atoms form chemical bonds? Maybe they don’t like being alone. Okay, that answer would probably fail, but it’s true. The world is a lonely place, and if AI makes it a little less so, what’s the harm in that? Honestly, I love chatting and I’m not even embarrassed.

Sunrise: eight seconds. 

Okay, so Mom doesn’t like it, but she doesn’t get it. And anyway, she doesn’t need to know about all the late nights.

Five seconds…

Although, she might start noticing something is up with all the chugging coffee and tired eyes. Yeah, the tired eyes are a problem. 

Three seconds…

Solution: eye drops, concealer, exfoliate.

I fucking HATE this place!!! I was bullied to the point of assault both at St. Joseph's elementary school, and Bishop Neumann Middle/High school. I was bullied by some ""charming"" little miscreant named tricia hughey at Lycoming Valley Middle School. I was bullied by my bitch stepmother, a dialysis nurse at Divine who would come home from work and tell us stories at the dinner table about one of their patients, a man with an intellectual delay; she made him sound like a goddamned court jester who was there for their entertainment. She told us MANY things that, under HIPAA, would have gotten her fired and possibly prosecuted. People's personal medical information, their identities, their conditions, whatever. Her brat spawn, four of them, treated me like garbage, too (what kind of bitch writes disparaging commentary in the margins of a 12 year-old 's DIARY, FFS???).

Of course, we had to make a very hypocritical appearance every Sunday and holiday at what used to be called ""church of the annunciation"" on 4th and Walnut (now st. Joseph the worker). Those two dickheads would host the coffee and donut social after mass every week, and then we'd go to Perkins for brunch where ""katie mae"" would bitch at the servers, say rude and racist shit about anyone she felt like, send her food back, you name it.

The only good things about this town in my life were my Nan & Pop Pop and my aunt & uncle and their kids. He made beautiful carved rocks.

But still, I was aware of a casual friendliness throughout the community I was exposed to (""dad"" and his new family hated Black and Queer people, but fortunately, my mother had a very diverse group of friends. My most influential childcare providers were a beautiful, mixed-race couple on Locust Street. I saw two of their babies come home from the hospital, I saw them come home from the hospital empty-handed after their newborn twins died at birth (or were possibly stillborn; I was 7 and didn't get a very detailed explanation). They were my extended family , and I loved and still miss them.

I was unaware at the time of just how widespread the racist hatred was here. As I got older, I continued to hear my cis-het, wyte supremacist sperm donor spewing racial slurs when he'd tell me about various neighborhoods in town and how the residents knew ""to stay in their place."" By twelve, I rejected ALL of his fundamental beliefs, his religion, his abusive cow of a third wife and her spawn, just all of it.

I was so shy, isolated, and socially inept, I didn't have many friends and I didn't really understand williamsport. I didn't know how fucking BIGOTED this place was - mostly because my sweet grandparents (and my aunt & uncle) were the kindest, sweetest people to ALL, and I feel privileged to be related to them.

I came back in 2004 to spend my Nan's final three years with her. Somehow, I got stuck here after she passed away. Since then, I ve been CHASED, with my young son in the car, by a redneck in his emotional support pickup truck (from the Market Street bridge to the Faxon exit of the beltway) because he saw my anti-trump bumper stickers. I had another, similar asshole ""roll coal"" in the faces of my son, my husband, and myself in the Lowe's parking lot because he didn't like my Pride, equality, and HRC stickers.

And come on, now... Those wacked-out letters written to the sun gazette by bible thumping religious fanatics are just embarrassing. Fucking CRAZY...

I can't wait to leave this dump. It's also a Superfund site, did you know that? Don't drink the tap water!

One drink I wanted to use was a clarified cocktail as none of the bars/restaurants in my area is really using this technique. After doing a little research I attempted a clarified margarita by milk washing lime, lemon, and orange juice with agave syrup and added whole milk to a batch and let sit for 2 hours. On my first try, the batch curdled with the curdles rising to the top and I filtered this through a coffee filter with great results with only one pass through the filter. However, after trying again I’m having a lot of trouble replicating this while also finding a way to make bigger batches (nice restaurant that does high(ish) volume).

After doing more research I’ve learned that I should have been adding the batch to the milk, but this has resulted in just a milky concoction that filters cloudy and continues to be cloudy after multiple passes. In order to do larger batches we got a cold brew coffee kit that has large paper filters but that filters a very cloudy product. 

Is there something I’m doing wrong here? Should I let the batch sit longer or overnight? Is multiple filtrations the answer (it takes forever)? Should I just clarify the juices and add the agave when making the drink? I’m really at a loss and frustrated as my first try went off without hitch and now nothing is working even the curdling isn’t as good with adding the juices to the milk. I’ve tried the 6:1 method.

* Wake up. Make iced coffee in a glass cup with a glass straw (*a crucial step in business operations*). 
* Arrange pastel stationery on an all-pink/all-white desk (*no actual paperwork, just vibes*). 
* Write a to-do list with a fuzzy pen on cute stationery (*step one: make more iced coffee*). 
* Spend 10 minutes packing each order like it’s a high-end PR gift box with shredded paper, freebies, handwritten notes, and perfume spritzed in the tissue paper.

And let’s talk about the nails.

* Three inches long.
* Covered in pearls, rhinestones, or full-blown 3D sculptures.
* How are they typing? How are they handling orders?
* How are they… you know… WIPING?! 😭

At this point, it feels like ""small business owner"" has become a social media aesthetic, not an actual job. Like, sure, if *Madison’s Dropshipping Sticker Emporium* has time to handwrite thank-you notes and curate a “brand experience” for every $3 Etsy order, good for her.

But the rest of us? We're just trying to afford printer ink and bulk mailers without going bankrupt.

1j9aufc,https://www.reddit.com/r/thepassportbros/comments/1j9aufc/3_months_into_moving_abroad_and_a_ton_of_fun/,"3 months into moving abroad and a ton of fun casual dates later, I can already see why people burnout and start looking for something serious","Warning: Long wall of text, writing this for personal posterity reasons but also to share my experience with the bros. 

I —24M, 5’9, South Asian, in decent shape from cardio— was excited to move from NYC to CDMX earlier this year because I’ve a remote job, the dating scene is undeniably much better, it’s a cheaper city while also being much more lively and I got to skip the cold winter!

Yes, constantly going on casual dates and hooking up with women out my league was as euphoric as I expected it to be (especially after only matching with women I’d consider unattractive and/or unambitious, not to mention a string of relationships back home that left me exhausted and annoyed about the dating culture in the US) 

BUT the novelty wears off. After some time here and a lot of reflection I’m realizing this isn’t emotionally sustainable and I’ve to start looking for something serious. Next time I’ve a real good feeling about someone (which has only happened a handful of times in my life so far), I’m going to make the leap and try to make it a forever thing. 

**Random anecdotes**:

**Girl #1** - Local Mexican girl that I met on Tinder, in her last year of uni, her English was just as bad as my Spanish but we surprisingly had a fun few dates regardless. I had to end it though (by lying that I was leaving soon, not proud) because she got too attached and needy after just 2-3 dates, I wasn’t used to being lovebombed like that and literally just got here too. Maybe it could’ve worked as I improved my Spanish and communicated that she was moving too fast but idk, it was a lot. 

**Lesson**: While I don’t blame her (bc different dating norms here, she’s a couple years younger than me and a bit naive about dating bc of it), I still feel bad and like I lead her on. Like hooking up right from first date and doing couple-y things like going to the museum/holding hands etc. Will be more cautious going forward. 

**Girl #2** - Another local Mexican girl, my age, works as a fitness instructor, met her at a coffee shop randomly and went on a couple of dates. There wasn’t a connection but she did spend a couple of years abroad so we could relate and talk about a bunch of things. Relatively affluent and has a great social circle. Asked her if she’d be open to being friends and she was open to it, we’re on chill terms now. 

**Lesson**: Sometimes it’s better to not think with your dick (i.e trying to sleep with every woman u can) and instead make friends in order to break into the local social scene (her friends and so on).  

**Girl #3** - Uruguayan girl who’s lived in Mexico for a decade, a year older than me, met her at a language exchange bar event. The date was boring, the sex was great but she came across as super materialistic and like she didn’t have any ambition or depth. Only saw her once. 

**Lesson**: There’s obviously a transactional nature to every relationship everywhere (even if it’s not explicit and around stuff like status/wealth/height etc) but someone being so blatant and having nothing to offer can be a huge turn off. 

**Girl #4** - Russian expat who’s been living in Mexico in order to get a better citizenship and travel more easily, met her off hinge. Crazy hot, out of my league, and we had the whole “foreigners living in a new city” connection so I was very excited and open to a serious relationship in the beginning but she turned out to be super flaky and high maintenance (not materialistically but stuff like asking me if I can change plans last minute etc) when it comes to actual dates. 

**Lesson**: It’s just not worth the headache,  frustration, and waste of time considering the opportunity cost of meeting other people. Even if she’s hot, especially if she’s hot. 

**Girl #5** - Half white and half mexican girl who is both a 3 years older than me and only lives in Mexico during the winters, met her at a EDM club. This is the girl I really caught feelings for and had an absolute blast with. 

It’s funny because the first date I was like “she’s cool but idk” but two months and a lot of dates later, I was definitely very upset (because winter was over and she left for her home country). Others I’ve been out with simply don’t compare to her, I know I’ll miss her bad. She reciprocates the feelings for the most part too but between her moving and being older/wanting to settle down very soon (unlike me) idk if it’ll go anywhere, we’ll see. 

**Lesson**: Sometimes even if you run into the person you hit it off and could see yourself in a “forever” thing with, circumstances and life goals don’t line up. But that’s okay, c’est la vie and we’ll live to fight another day. 

Some other broads that didn’t really make an impression or leave me with a lesson but you get the point I’m trying to make. 

Anyways, I recognize this is still a good problem to have (because it doesn’t feel like I’m dragging my nuts through glass shards only to be rejected by mid and/or neurotically entitled women like back in NYC) but curious to hear if any of you can relate and have stories/perspectives to share, especially if you’re older than me. 

I’ll probably make a separate post with a full list of places to both meet women but also fun date spots but DM me if you’re visiting soon and have any questions, have a decent sense of CDMX after living here for a bit. ",27,1741753151.0,thepassportbros,29,0.87,False

1j9atjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlasticFreeLiving/comments/1j9atjw/manually_curated_list_of_suggestions_for/,manually curated list of suggestions for minimizing micro & nano plastics for health,"Here's a list of the top suggestions I've collected from everywhere I can of how to minimize microplastics & nano-plastics (MNPs). It's a Google Sheets table here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OG-NJZZ4I587LxP4kvp0WhAUIWGC-yR6Ets0Flr7P5M/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OG-NJZZ4I587LxP4kvp0WhAUIWGC-yR6Ets0Flr7P5M/edit?usp=sharing)

It's open to anyone for commenting to help make it more comprehensive or add tweaks. This contains several things the AI generated list from several days ago missed. If this is missing anything particularly important, let's improve it to the point where it isn't.

Here's an unformatted copy/paste that doesn't preserve the table format but is readable for those who don't want to click the link (the formatted copy/paste looks like it works in the compose window but then the post lacks all newlines & table structure):

category	issue/area	what to do

food & drink	water source	prefer tap to bottled water, ideally filtered tap water (eg reverse osmosis removes MNPs)

food & drink	water transport	prefer all-plastic-free (including the lid) water bottles (those with plastic-free lids are harder to find but still widely available; eg Kleen Kanteen & Healthy Human have non-plastic lid options)

food & drink	other store bought cold drinks	prefer glass bottles to plastic or cans

food & drink	straws	prefer metal straws or paper straws over plastic straws (including those built into lids of water bottles), or simply avoid straw use (drink liquids, use spoons for smoothies)

food & drink	hot drinks	prefer steel, ceramic, or glass mugs, cups, tumblers, etc. over plastic, styrofoam, or paper (eg common disposable/to-go paper cups, which contain plastic lining to prevent the paper getting damp); this is most difficult when getting hot drinks out to-go since it requires bringing a container with you

food & drink	food storage	prefer glass containers, ideally with non-plastic lids (not necessary if container will stay level eg in fridge, but there are silicone & glass lids for some containers); do NOT heat plastic containers in microwaves

food & drink	coffee brewing	pour-over & cold brewing can both be done entirely without plastic, and the new Aeropress Premium allows for Aeropress brewing entirely without plastic

food & drink	tea brewing	some tea bags are made without plastic but others aren't, so look up which brands are which (many lists on the web) & prefer the non-plastic brands, or use loose leaf

food & drink	take-out / to-go food	prefer paper to-go food containers, though these (eg stereotypical Chinese food white ones) probably have plastic lining like to-go coffee cups, or better yet bring your own; do NOT reheat plastic containers in microwaves; ideally transfer out of plastic containers into glass as soon as home

food & drink	cooking containers	prefer steel (or cast iron) cooking pots & pans over non-stick

food & drink	cooking utensiles	prefer steel or wood (or maybe silicone) cooking utensiles (spatulas, spoons, etc.) over plastic

food & drink	dinnerware & utensils	prefer non-plastic dinnerware & utensils; easy at home so mostly an issue if packing meals to eat on the go eg a picnic where then the issue is more hassle to bring non-disposable stuff back home to clean later

food & drink	cutting boards	prefer wood cutting boards over plastic

food & drink	hand dishwashing	prefer natural-fiber cloths for manual dishwashing over plastic sponges, scrubbers, or nets

food & drink	supermarket transport	don't put produce in plastic bags

food & drink	canned food	prefer food sold in glass jars or over that in cans, or cook beans & lentils from dry (in a plastic-free cooker) & cook frozen or fresh veggies, etc. since most cans use plastic linings; note that Eden Organics cans are reportedly plastic-free as they are claimed to use a special plant-based alternative

food & drink	food choices	MNPs seem to be found in many/most foods, but many reports suggest some foods have higher levels, notably fish (esp shellfish), processed foods (eg chicken nuggets), & alcohol, but not diving deep on this

food & drink?	chewing gum	avoid or minimize chewing gum as it reportedly releases MNPs though I haven't looked into this deeply

		

appliances	dishwasher model choice	prefer dishwashers with stainless steel tubs over plastic tubs

appliances	dishwasher trays & holders	remove plastic utensil shelves & baskets and replace with all-metal utensil baskets (such as those available for hanging off of the side of air-dry dish racks)

appliances	dishwasher detergent	prefer powder or tablets not wrapped in plastic vs pods, whose clear wrappers are plastic-based

appliances	rice, pressure, & slow cookers	prefer rice cookers, slow-cookers, & pressure cookers where no plastic touchers the food

appliances	water kettles	prefer water kettles where no plastic touches the water

appliances	blenders, food processors, & mixers	prefer blenders, food processors, & mixers with no plastic parts touching the ingredients, i.e. glass containers instead of plastic (not sure if this is available for food processors)

appliances	washing machines & dryers & habits around them	clean the lint filter on the dryer carefully to make sure it goes as much as possible only into the trash (& wash hands after handling the lint); as much as possible air or line dry items that aren't entirely made from natural fibers; don't use higher heat settings than necessary

appliances	vaccuum cleaners	use ones with HEPA filters to catch MNPs in the environment

appliances	air filters	use them, & HEPA probably slightly better than others

		

dental care & orthodonture	toothbrushes	get non-plastic toothbrushes, eg boar's hair bristles & bamboo handles are available, though uncommon

dental care & orthodonture	floss	get non-plastic floss, eg silk floss is available, though uncommon, or possibly use water flossing though things like WaterPik push the water through a plastic device, though only very briefly

dental care & orthodonture	braces	consider metal braces over plastic trays (eg Invisalign) given the time spent directly in mouth

dental care & orthodonture	retainers	consider metal-only retainer options over plastic retainers given long-term overall time spent directly in mouth

		

fabrics	clothing	prefer clothing made entirely or as much as possible from natural materias/fibers such as cotton, wool, linen, silk over polyester & other synthenitcs

fabrics	bedding	prefer bedding made of natural materials/fibers such as cotton, especially for pillow cases that will be near the mouth

fabrics	towels	prefer towels, washcloths, & napkins made of natural materials/fibers such as cotton

fabrics	rugs / carpets	prefer entirely or as much as possible natural fibers eg cotton over anything with plastic

fabrics	yoga mats	prefer yoga mats made entirely of natural fibers; all-natural rubber, cork, & cotton mats are commonly available (and many eco-friendly yoga mat roundup reviews are available)

		

landscaping	grass / lawn	prefer natural (living) grass or grass-alternative ground-cover over artificial lawns (aka astroturf); try not to touch turf then touch mouth if forced onto turf (eg by soccer games) & wash body & clothes after ideally

		

		

		

		

notes	blood tests	there is no direct blood test (or any other test) to quantify the level of accumulated micro & nano plastics (MNPs) in a body, but note that Quest has a $350 PFAS (""forever chemicals"") test & these chemicals are somewhat related though not the same thing; it's not clear yet clear what if any clinical value this test has (if it's low, that doesn't necessarily mean one is free of accumulated MNPs, though if it's high that's probably a sign that there are things that could benefically be changed)

notes	health not environment	this list is centered around health reasons to minimize plastic exposure rather than environmental reasons to minimize plastics in general, which would mostly be a superset of what's listed here

notes	suggestions	this sheet is initial anyone-can-comment so maybe it can grow slowly via crowdsourcing, so feel free to suggest informed corrections, additions, or other elaborations, but let's not go crazy---if too much stuff comes in, I'll probably need to shut that down; maybe try to make at most a few comments, then wait until I accept them or comment why I don't agree before adding more; would people like columns to name or link specific products?

		

resources	forum	Reddit's r/PlasticFreeLiving

resources	web pages	too many to list round ups of microplastics & tips about them

resources	services	services to help people mitigate plastic in their homes & lives are starting to pop up, probably mostly as an extra aspect of existing services to minimize toxins or dangers to young kids in homes, eg [ourmindfulhome.co](http://ourmindfulhome.co) (with the plastic angle emphasized in an article about them)",6,1741753062.0,PlasticFreeLiving,1,1.0,False
1j9at29,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j9at29/my_supposed_love_of_my_life_gf_who_i_have_not_met/,My supposed love of my life gf who i have not met expects me to make 300k a year so we can start dating irl and and so HER dad would accept me because im not white.,"Ive been ""dating"" this girl for 2-3 years and we havent met because she has social anxiety and her parents wont let her. The thing is she wants to be in a relationship but not meet? she goes out with friends but wont even grab a coffee with me, her long time ""bf"". im putting it in quotes since we are online dating even tho she lives an hour away. At the start of us talking i said i cant do this online thing, but she proceeds to love bomb me even though she states she cant date. I know its my fault for even giving in and following through to date her. It all starts out nice and i thought she would eventually change her mind or come around once she gets to know me.... but no i was not enough for her even after 3 years for her to meet me. I got tired of the online dating and when i presented my needs again, it would cause a fight. My needs were to simply meet irl slowly as i needed physical interactions with my gf as any human would want. But that idea to her was impossible. I even gave her an ultimatum that we can breakup or we can try to meet irl but on her terms to make it comfy as possible but no that caused another fight and she started calling me unfair for wanting to meet and too breakup yet again. another problem i have with her is she expects me to make 300k a year so her family will accept me since im not a white man. She also says she wants to know that she will be taken care of, but thats so unrealistic im only 23 and shes 20 not even working herself. I just got a job recently to start progressing for my life and career and shes mad now that i dont spend any time with her 24/7 cause im working and taking care of other responsibilities like taking care of my dog and family. Obviously if i dont have time for a girl i shouldnt be in a relationship but i can make time but it wont be 24/7. That still isnt enough for her. 

I worked my ass off 11hrs a day for 3 months and stopped talking to her as much since i really wanted my career to take priority and earn money. She started being so hostile and brought me down for having a job and not giving her attention. she would call me anything and everything to put me down. Then when i speak up against her and explain myself she says im justifying and invalidating her feelings by not giving her needs priority. She also got upset when i wouldnt buy her something for after i told her im saving and want to not spend anything i dont even spend on myself yet she expects me to buy shit for her and i dont im an asshole. I dont judge people and i believe shes a nice girl but she is exhausting me but i cant let go, I need help. Shes said she could get a rich guy if she wanted to, like is that supposed to make me feel good ;-;.



The other problem is im so blinded by love i keep staying and have a hard time ending it with her. we spent so much time together i cant leave. i feel so alone when we would ""breakup"" i dont enjoy gaming or any of my hobbies i shared with her cause it would remind me of her. She keeps saying i love you and then proceeds to diss me and my whole existence if i dont act the way she wants. ON top of all this she wont even date or ""marry me"" if dont meet her standards then blames me for causing fights when i get irritated how my needs are not met but i have to meet hers. 

  
I know this is all very cringy and not normal, but i really did/do love this girl, i just dont know why she is acting like this. Some days she loves me and others she resents me. I know im an idiot and should block her and get tf out but my heart hurts, i tried really hard to be a good person to her but why isnt that enough for her.",1,1741753009.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False
1j9asyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiKilledMyStartUp/comments/1j9asyl/chatgpts_power_move_from_answer_machine_to_your/,ChatGPT's Power Move: From Answer Machine to Your New Work Buddy! 🚀,"AI is about to take its career aspirations to the next level. Move over Watson and Siri—2025 is the year AI stops just answering questions and starts getting things done, courtesy of OpenAI’s latest ambitions for ChatGPT. According to Kevin Weil, OpenAI's Chief Product Officer, ChatGPT will become 'agentic', meaning it won't just be churning out answers; it'll be out there completing tasks in the real world. It's like sending your virtual assistant on coffee runs, if coffee runs consisted of complex computational tasks.

Imagine a time when AI isn't just a tool, but a partner in productivity, boosting our capabilities with its newly found ‘agent’ status. No more mundane chores or repetitive office tasks. Instead, we could use this extra bandwidth to chase after lofty pursuits or deeper problem-solving. But while some folks envision two-hour workdays filled with leisurely pursuits of poetry and universal basic income, Weil believes humans won't abandon their quest for problem-solving. Because let’s face it, we get a kick out of creating chaos and then heroically untangling it.

But don't uncork the champagne just yet; Weil also noted that the AI landscape is evolving at warp speed. The pace at which AI models are iterating is mind-boggling, leaving even the most agile tech companies scrambling to rethink strategies every couple of months. It's a classic tech tug-of-war, with Microsoft reportedly experimenting with AI models that could challenge OpenAI's dominance, ready to swap out one generation of algorithms for the next as rapidly as consumers swap out smartphones.

Even within this tech frenzy, there's debate. Are large language models getting commoditized, becoming mere tools in a developer's tech stack? Weil thinks not, arguing that while competition is fierce, leading by even a few months gives companies the edge. But some, like Digits CEO Jeff Seibert, contend that for many applications, the specific AI model becomes less critical as they become interchangeable.

In this brave new world of AI agents and relentless innovation, we're prompted to ponder: Will AI truly empower us, or are we gearing up for warfare against our silicon overlords? As we stand on the brink of this agentic shift, one can't help but wonder—how will our roles evolve with AI taking the reins of routine tasks? 🤔 What would you do with a virtual assistant capable of more than mere conversation?
