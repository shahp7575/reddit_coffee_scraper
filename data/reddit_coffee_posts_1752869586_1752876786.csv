Complications: 

* Autism
* ADHD
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Inexplicable streak of impractical idealism
* Crippling back pain when I’m on my feet for too long
* Penchant for unnecessary verbosity in personal matters
* About 6k debt to the IRS (long-term payment plan) and 50k\~ total credit card debt (currently collection proof)
* Few in-person contacts
* No professional network
* Horrendous fashion sense; wardrobe consists of t-shirts, sweatpants, and one pair of jeans
* Full-time dad; have to work around partner’s work schedule

Advantages: 

* White dude
* Young enough to still be pretty (for now)
* Capable of maintaining basic hygiene
* Mainecare (for now…)
* $1000/mo would cover all unavoidable expenses with a little extra to save
* World-class talent for effective complaining

Academic/work history:

1. Took early college classes, got a full scholarship. Wanted to learn graphic design and animation and work for Pixar. Dropped out after one semester; coursework wasn’t what I expected, and I didn’t have another major in mind.
2. Tried being a writer. It didn’t work out. Checked out of reality for a few years, got by on SSI.
3. First job: nine months as temporary maintenance dude at a major chain coffee shop. Washed dishes, mopped floors, took out trash, and so on. Went home each day feeling like I’d been beaten with a hammer.
4. One year in call center customer service for a major outdoor gear retailer. Did well, got promoted to a role with a lot more responsibilities… and a raise of a quarter per hour. I walked out without notice, couldn’t stand to do so much more work for so little extra money. They called to ask if they could get me to come back; I didn’t think to ask for a bigger raise.
5. Three months as a seasonal stocker in a warehouse for the same retailer. Good work, but I could feel my body breaking down a little more each day. Finished the season, but didn’t go back for that role.
6. Back to college, this time for computer science. Still got a full scholarship despite previous dropout, made the dean’s list… and in two years, the only time I ever touched a computer for school was in English class. Got disillusioned with college, had to drop out to support my family through a crisis.
7. Two weeks of inbound sales for a local marketing firm. First week was a training class with a charming guy who knew the craft well. Second week, I was on the phones selling snake oil to the elderly. I had the best numbers of anyone in my class, and hated myself a little more with every closed deal. Broke down crying at my desk, got told to go home and didn’t come back.
8. Two months as a call center banking specialist for a major international bank. I was good enough at the job that they didn’t bother wasting my time with performance review meetings. Boss didn’t like me, so she found an excuse to fire me. Around this time, I took on my first debt to support my family.
9. Family crisis ended, coasted on SSI for a year. Then, surprise! Covid has entered the ring! New crisis, new financial need for me to fill.
10. Tried writing again, lucked into a gig writing thin content for 10 cents per word. Kept it up for a year, took laughably little effort to make more money than most people I knew could dream of. Slowly driven mad by the cognitive dissonance. Couldn’t justify searching for meaningful work at a steep pay cut, but wasn’t learning anything from the work that paid well.

I felt like a fraud, sure, but it was worse than that. I had progressively worsening moral concerns, that I was writing marketing materials for products that no one should ever buy for any reason. But I couldn’t bear to risk my income by rocking the boat, so I sucked it up and tried to power through.

Towards the end I would sit at my computer, staring at the blank page for days at a time, unable to force myself to touch a single key. Then the day before the deadline would arrive, and I’d bang out the entire week’s work in a single afternoon.

I always met my deadlines.

Until one day I didn’t.

I just couldn’t do it anymore.

1. Couldn’t work for the next couple years. The mere thought of returning to writing caused panic attacks, and I had negative interest in any other work I was qualified for. Also lost my SSI, as I had been proven gainfully employable. My savings slowly disappeared, and I paid the rent with credit cards I couldn’t pay off.
2. In time, my financial desperation overpowered the paralysis that had kept me from writing. New problem was that AI was becoming a thing, and entry-level writing was the first work to be consumed by it. Thin content work became much harder to find, and I didn’t have the portfolio or references to prove I could do “real” writing projects. I spent the entire spring and summer trying to rebuild my writing career, such as it was, and in that time I earned $200.

This was when my partner got pregnant.

1. Four months as a seasonal packer for that same outdoor gear retailer. Packing orders had a lower impact on my body, and I loved the work, but I could still only work three sixes a week; any more, and I would be in constant agony. They were happy to let me have the schedule I could manage, though 18 hours a week meant not much money. Finished out the season with every intention of going back.
2. Four months working the laundry room at a nursing home. Enjoyed that job too, and they let me work three sixes so I would be comfortable, but I ended up a zombie soon after my kid was born; I had to leave, or I was going to die in a car crash on the long commute. I meant to request a temporary hiatus until I could function again, but a series of miscommunications turned that hiatus into a permanent departure.
3. Six months as a professional gambler. I use that term loosely; I was beating sweepstakes casinos at their own game with a 4.5% player edge they provided. Played blackjack on my phone all day while holding my infant son with my other arm. Multiplied my meager savings more than 20x before they all got wise and gave me the boot. This is the only reason I have any money left today.

Around this time, my partner switched careers from server to CNA. Makes better money and finds the work more fulfilling, though she now has a tough schedule to work around.

1. One day as a dishwasher at a steakhouse, burning my hands on 200-degree ceramic dishes and grinding my back into dust to keep up with demand. Boss ran into me the next morning, saw that I wasn’t the same person I had been the morning before, and said it was best for everyone if I didn’t clock in.

That brings me to now. My partner works Monday and Wednesday mornings, Thursday afternoons, and all day on Sundays. I’ve got another season packing boxes at the warehouse coming up, will be working evenings Monday through Wednesday. That doesn’t start for another two months, so I’m looking for something else in the meantime.

The way I see it, potential options fall into one of a few categories:

* Worst case scenario: accept an unhinged 40+ hour workweek, waste money paying someone else to watch my son on days both parents have to work.
* Strongly preferable alternative: part-time work where the shifts occur at times my partner isn’t working, so one of us can always be home to care for the baby.
* Ideal: work I can do from home, at my own pace, *while* on dad duty. You know, like writing.

I’d be happy to take anything that involves only moderate psychological torture, and lets me work exactly Friday and Saturday to fill the gaps in my schedule. But I know that, in this job market, even that is asking for the moon.

I’ve been told I might excel in a higher-quality sales position, one where slimy tactics and worthless products aren’t the norm. I’m open to the idea, but have found that job posts in that field consist of a *terrifying* number of employment scams… and the ones that aren’t scams are, for the most part, fake job listings.

Once I get my feet under me, I intend to take a more systematic approach to building a writing career from the ground up. I aim to be working on ambition instead of desperation. Need income that exceeds my expenses before that can become a reality, though.

More than once, I’ve started to learn programming in the hope of having an honest-to-god ***Marketable Skill***, but life always seems to get in the way. I’d like to give it a more dedicated effort someday, when I’ve got sustainable income from a combination of part-time jobs and writing.

**Now my questions to you, Reddit:** What would you do in my position?

Do you know of any companies that might take a risk on this trainwreck of a resume? 

What about fields where the entry-level job posts online are *not* predominantly scams or fake listings?

Maybe a job search support group to join so that this process doesn’t feel quite so agonizingly isolating?

Perhaps, last of all, you could name other subreddits where I might find useful answers?

Okay lads hear me out this might sound kinda insane but I can’t shake it.
Been sitting with this for weeks and it keeps circling back stronger every time.

I’ve started calling it The Conscious Drift Theory
Because I think it explains a lot of the weird stuff that never gets real answers at least by proven scientific lens.
Like why déjà vu happens, or why some people randomly change overnight.
Why we sometimes feel like we’ve been here before, why people survive accidents they really shouldn’t have.
Or why someone can be in a coma for years but look totally fine.
Even ghosts, sleep paralysis, dreams that feel too real, Mandela effects and shit on and on.
I think it’s all tied together

Alright so here’s how Drift Theory works and as mentioned it starts with sleep.

Sleep is weird.
Like we need it or everything starts breaking down. Miss one night and you already feel off. Miss more and stuff gets blurry, unreal even.
But what’s wild is, while your body’s knocked out, your brain’s going nuts especially during deep sleep.

Now here’s where it kicks in.
The theory says when we sleep, our consciousness actually moves into another version of reality.

Same are going to be same people, same room, same life but difference will be that something’s just a little off.
EXACTLY Like… a parallel universe! 

And the drift isn’t random. It’s based on your mental state, choices, what direction your life’s heading in and your actions.
(Lemme explain in a bit)

Your body stays in bed. But your awareness (the you that thinks and feels) doesn’t.
You wake up in a version of reality that’s just slightly different than yesterday’s.

mightn be the reason sometimes it feels like people’s personalities shifted, a logo looks off
Or a memory doesn’t match reality anymore
Like you SWEAR! something used to be different

It’s almost subtle
Most folks brush it off, But once you really start paying attention… it’s hard to unsee

That’s where the Mandela Effect comes in.

(Quick recap in case someone’s not deep into this stuff-the Mandela Effect is when a ton of people remember something one way, but reality says it never happened like that. Like the Monopoly guy having a monocle he doesn’t. Or the Berenstein Bears being spelled with an “e” apparently, it’s always been Berenstain with an “a”. mindfuck.)

But what if it did happen exactly the way you remember it… Just not on this Earth?

So according to our theory, when you sleep, your consciousness hops into a slightly different version of reality.
Most of it’s identical. Your room looks the same, your phone’s still next to you, your dog still hates the mailman.
But tiny details can glitch.

Like a movie line sounding weird, a logo looking wrong, even someone close to you acting slightly off.

Here’s what I mean most of the time, when you drift, your memory realigns perfectly with the world you landed in. You don’t notice the shift, just get up and go make your coffee like usual. But sometimes you get that off feeling.

Like:	You swear it was Berenstein Bears growing up, not Berenstain.

The Monopoly guy? Definitely had a monocle. But apparently never did

“Luke, I am your father” wasn’t that the Star Wars line? Nope. It’s “No, I am your father”

Fruit of the Loom had that cornucopia thing in the logo… except it never existed.

“Febreze” had two E’s right? Like Febreeze. No shit.

Pikachu had a black tip on his tail. Not anymore

“Sketchers” with a T? Never had one.

So you might be drifted into a nearby Earth where those small cultural details were always different, that’s the glitch.

Now let’s talk about death. Yeah, this is where shit gets spooky!

This is also where Drift Theory overlaps with something called Quantum Immortality (which is basically the idea that you never actually experience your own death, or you never really die) 

From your perspective, you always just… keep going.

So imagine this you’re in a brutal car crash (god forbid).

You die Instantly Game over, NOT REALLY.

Just like in sleep, it drifts (your consciousness)

Into the timeline where you prolly barely survived and wake up in a hospital, dazed but alive. OR crazier maybe where you somehow walked away with just a scratch.

Or maybe you don’t even remember it happening at all just this weird off feeling the next day.

On the original earth where you had the car crash, yes, You’re dead. To them(friends and family), you’re gone.

But from your POV, you’re not. You shifted. And just kept living.

Same with stuff like- You fell off a roof but somehow landed just right
A truck should’ve hit you, but it “just missed”
You drank way too much and should’ve blacked out or worse… but woke up totally fine, confused as hell

Okay, You ever have those moments where you know you should’ve died? But you didn’t.

Yup, That’s Drift.

Long story short! [We don’t die.
We just wake up somewhere else]

It’s comforting and abso-fucking-lately terrifying at the same time.

Okay moving on, so let’s talk ghosts.
(Stay with me now)

Here’s one way to think about it- We live in what’s basically a 3D+1 world height, width, depth, and time.
But our conscious experience is linear. We only see the now, the current frame ie.present 

We can’t move backward or forward freely in time. 

Now imagine if there are fragments of consciousness or beings that aren’t stuck likeus.

Maybe they’re higher-dimensional entities (4D or 5D and all the D that goes on) watching us the way we might watch ants on a piece of paper.

Wait wait, ever noticed people saying ghosts often show up in loops. Same hallway Same outfit, even same action, over and over again.


Now here’s where things start to bend a little, tell me?

If we keep drifting from Earth to Earth… Then where did it start? And where does it end? There has to a point where you are really born and you are died!?

Kind of a paradox, right? I call this the Origin Point Paradox.

The solution might be simpler than you think.
Maybe consciousness doesn’t move in a straight line from birth to death like we’re told. it’s not linear at all (maybe).

It drifts, Sideways-Forward-Back-Into directions we literally can’t measure (try visualising 4th or 5th Dimension)

And every time you land somewhere new, your memory just, syncs up with that version of you on that Earth.

So this probably happens. You live a full life> You grow old> And one night, you die peacefully in your sleep.
That should be the end, right?

Guess what? maybe it’s not.

Maybe the Drift still happens
But this time, instead of waking up the next morning…
You wake up in a women’s womb!!
As a baby. All over again

You’ve drifted into a timeline where your life is just beginning
And because, again, your memory realigns with the Earth you’ve drifted into, you don’t remember any of it
At least not consciously.

BUT BUT BUT! Sometimes there is a glitch.

Heard about? Kids who talk about lives they shouldn’t know, Places they’ve never been
And Names they couldn’t have heard.
Some even claiming that they remember their past life. 
Whole stories that don’t line up with anything around them. MIGHT BE A GLITCH

Well guess that brings us full circle.


Drift Theory: Explained Through Sleep Cycles

Time to get serious.
This is where Drift Theory and modern sleep science start to overlap in ways that feel…(weird or) way too clean to ignore.

Here’s how the stages of sleep might literally explain how your consciousness drifts.

1. Light Sleep (Stages 1 & 2 called- NREM)
Scientific side: This is the dozing off’ stage. Your body starts relaxing, breathing slows, brainwaves shift into theta. You’re not quite awake, not quite asleep.

Drift Theory take: This is when your anchor begins to loosen. Your awareness hasn’t left this timeline yet, but it’s unhooking.

2. Deep Sleep (Stage 3 NREM / Slow-Wave Sleep)
Scientific side: This is dreamless, body repair mode. Your immune system kicks in, tissue rebuilds, memories get filed away. It’s also when brain activity hits its absolute lowest point. You are basically offline.

Drift Theory take:
This is the void.
Your body is just a vessel now.
Your consciousness isn’t tethered anymore. 
This is the closest state to death without actually dying
(And a fun fact, the early stages of clinical death? Identical brain shutdown patterns.)

3. REM Sleep (Rapid Eye Movement)

Scientific side:This is when your brain lights up like it’s awake. You feel vivid dreams, Emotional surges. 
Your body is literally paralyzed to keep you from acting out in dreams.

Drift Theory take:
This is the launch.
This is when the drift actually happens, your consciousness slides into the version of Earth that fits your life and actions.
Everything syncs, memories, environment, subtle sensory details. You wake up… and the new timeline is so similar that you don’t even notice the change.
Except, sometimes you do, that is called GLITCH! (Ever felt weird and out if order after waking up?)

Real mind-fucker. Stage 3 of deep sleep and early death are eerily similar. YourHeart rate slows then breathing softens followed by muscles stop responding, the conscious mind disappears.
And yet-you wake up.

Common Questions That Might Be Eating Your Brain Right Now!?

1. There’s no proof. Isn’t this just fantasy?

Yeah.
There’s no proof. (Metaphysics) Just like there’s no proof for simulation theory or reincarnation or whatever weird thing your aunty believes in.
This isn’t meant to be science.’

2. But science already explains sleep.

Yeah sure.
Your Brainwaves. REM cycles. Melatonin. Circadian rhythms and on and on.
We’ve got charts and machines and fancy terms. But science still can’t fully explain:
Why sleep deprivation messes with reality
Why dreams sometimes feel more real than life
Or why, in deep sleep, your consciousness just disappears completely and then magically comes back like nothing happened
Like… what kind of glitch is that?


3. If sleep = drifting, what happens when you don’t sleep?

What kind of question is that? Practically enough, hallucinations creep in. 
Reality bends. (Anyway, try not to sleep more then 24 hours, you will fall asleep no matter what)

4. What about death? Don’t people die?

From your point of view? Yeah. People die.
But here’s the twist-You never experience your own death. You only ever experience continuity.

(Yes, this ties into Quantum Immortality. And yeah, it’s creepy af.)

None of this is proven. This is just a personal theory based on sleep cycles, quantum immortality, Mandela effects, and weird hunches that a lot of us have but we lot never really talk about.

The idea is simple:
Every time you sleep, you drift.
Every time you “die, you don’t feel it you shift.
And maybe there was never one “you to begin with, but rather a stream of consciousness jumping from one universe to other.

LONG STORY SHORT!: Drift Theory is when we sleep, we don’t stay in the same universe. Our consciousness drifts into a slightly different version of reality. This could explain déjà vu, Mandela effects, near-death escapes, ghosts, dreams, and maybe even rebirth.

We still haven’t touched on dreams, sleep paralysis, phantom memories, or those impossible moments from childhood, do any if you got any stories or suggestions that might help in improving this Thoery? 

And AGAIN: This is just a personal theory which you cannot prove or disprove so basically metaphysics) ",1,1752876571.0,SimulationTheory,0,1.0,False

Pristiq was good but it made me a little too energized and gave me daily headaches. I’m trying to find an ssri that will work for my OCD because I can’t enjoy absolutely anything in life right now without having my phone in my hand to google anything and everything I can fixate on. My doctor started me on Luvox today and wants to get me to 150mg in the next couple months. To be honest I am scared because I read that sertraline is the best for OCD, which is what I wanted to try first  and coffee is my favorite thing in this world. I don’t know how I’m going to give up coffee, decaf is not the same. I enjoy the feeling. But knowing Luvox will cause caffeine to be in my system for over 50 hours is really scary.

Surfshark honestly felt the easiest to use and didn’t murder my battery like I expected.

I’m mostly using it now to access blocked websites when I’m not on WiFi I trust (especially uni campus WiFi, which feels sketchy sometimes).

Just drop a comment and I’ll send the link in 10 minutes.,"Chapter 1 My daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards. He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night. By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll. I screamed her name—once, twice—but Kiara didn’t answer. My baby didn’t even flinch. I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, “Colsen, she’s your daughter too. How could you do this to her?” “She’s my child,” he snarled, “just like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine—but why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!” My throat tightened. I didn’t know how to respond—because nothing I said would matter. So he did worse. He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake. I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up. At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. “There's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It’s too late.” She had just turned seven yesterday. And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses’ children were worth more than our own. I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll. But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter. There they were—Colsen’s “missing” sons—playing happily in the living room. And Colsen? He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything. My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank. When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly. He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go."" I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along."" Get along? What a joke. Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened. I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak. Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand."" Understand? But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart. I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive! In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had. ""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor. ""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!"" Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore..."" ""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?"" My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara..."" Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood. The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious. Chapter 2 When I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone. Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen. He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?"" I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me. We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years. In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman. But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless. When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene. I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance—no matter what. But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death. Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss. In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce."" ""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!"" Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang. ""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!"" Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here! ""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted. But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room. Chapter 3 It wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water. She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!"" Her words didn't bother me anymore. I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love. ""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you—weak and pathetic. ""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!"" ""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore. Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?"" ""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me..."" Then, the door burst open with a loud bang. Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!"" He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?"" The blow knocked me over. My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face. But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace..."" ""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!"" But that night, the temperature was -20°C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment? ""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes. Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing."" ""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me. ""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!"" The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood. A wave of despair washed over me. Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke. My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?"" Chapter 4 Astrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything."" ""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned. I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!"" Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!"" ""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still. Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids."" In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames—reduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes. I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing. ""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault. ""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either. ""I'm a terrible mother."" Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out. I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable. On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party. The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse. As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins. ""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will..."" I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes. Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!"" Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force. Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head. He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room. Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?"" Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?"" Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!"" ""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face. He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself! ""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!"" My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!"" ""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?"" I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged. After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends. What a terrible ending. ""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling. ""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1752876137.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

Ever been halfway through setting up email automation only to hit that dreaded ""Enter your API key"" screen? You're sitting there with your coffee, ready to send those perfectly crafted campaigns, and suddenly you're stuck on this technical hurdle. I've been there, and honestly, the confusion between API keys, OAuth tokens, and regular passwords had me scratching my head for way too long.

Here's what you'll find in this step-by-step guide:

• **Exact walkthrough** with interactive screenshots showing every single click

• **What API keys actually are** vs other credential types (finally explained simply!)

• **Real automation examples** like welcome series, order notifications, and lead nurturing

• **Security best practices** that don't require a computer science degree

• **Integration ideas** for WordPress, Shopify, Zapier, HubSpot, and more

The thing that clicked for me: Your API key is basically a special password that lets your apps talk to Maileroo automatically 24/7. No more manual login every time you want to send an email or check stats - it just works in the background.

Coolest use case I discovered: Setting up automated sequences where a new user signup triggers a 7-day welcome series, personalized onboarding emails, and engagement tracking that can boost user engagement by 300%.

**Check out the full interactive tutorial here:** https://blog.creddy.me/generate-maileroo-api-key-tutorial/

**Pro tip:** Copy your API key immediately after generating it - you won't be able to see the full key again once you navigate away!

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited.

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

The TEV Ursa Minor had docked at the closest station with full GalNet connections to upload and report the data from our exploration, which meant most of the crew would have 3 days of shore leave while the captain and data team swam through the red tape of reporting official findings. Unless they broke a console by smashing it in rage thanks to nitpicky bureaucratic paperwork or filing requirements, Rosa and our engineering team would have lots of free time. As a result, we gathered the usual suspects for an ethically and legally required first move on shore leave - hit the bar!

I stepped off the ramp into the docking area of the station and glared as a cleaning bot skittered by.

“Oh, come on!” Rosa exclaimed. “You aren’t being followed anymore. We’ve addressed the cleaning bot situation on the ship, and you have to agree that with the new schedule your quarters have never been so clean and comfy. Not a spec of dust or leftover fur anywhere. I’ve made sure of it!”

There was something to be said for having the cleanest quarters on the ship without lifting a finger, and it was nice to have hotel level turn down service daily. The only catch is that sometimes it’s nice to come home to a pile of used blankets to collapse in rather than a neatly made bed every time. A mess you made, and one you can come home to without guilt. I might ask Rosa to set the bots to randomly skip a few days every now and then. 

That said, my glare at the cleaning bot had less to do with anything on the ship and more to do with the reminder that my credit account was about to be cleared out. Jarl had called in his debt of drinks from our race way back when I joined the crew, plus the extras he’d picked up from our races in Supa-Dupa Cart. My overconfidence in Supa-Dupa-Dooms was my Achilles heel in the game, so over time my drink debt to the big lug had built up.

Being the friendly sort that he was, he didn’t ask to claim a few drinks here and there. Nope. We all had shore leave, and Haasha would be covering everybody’s tab thanks to Jarl. I wanted to be angry about it, yet I just couldn’t bring myself to get grumpy with the lovable lunk who liked to share with friends. I just wish he had waited until I had a few more paychecks saved up before calling the entire debt due.

Stepping away from the ship and starting to walk over to the station map on the hall, we were startled when someone called out my name.

“Miss Haasha? Of the TEV Ursa Minor?” the metallic voice of a translator called out and we all turned in confusion towards the voice. Lynn and Chang stepped to one side to let the being get a clear view of me.

The Vrazian, a tall and thin quadrupedal insectoid with an ant-like head, had its four arms raised and pincers wide open in pleasure. Clearly satisfied to have found its target, the sapient skittered over to me with gusto.

“Yes? May I be of assistance?” I said rather formally after I noticed the individual was wearing a sash of white and blue stripes indicating they were a diplomat.

“I have a delivery for you! Please place your hand on this Identireader to acknowledge acceptance of your parcel,” the sapient requested through the translator box on its chest and I complied when the diplomat bent down to my level and presented the reader. With my identity confirmed, I was led over to a large cargo crate. 

The Vrazian bowed and walked away now with their four pinchers raised even higher in a gesture of excitement. With a quick motion they put the Identireader away and pulled out a personal datapad to make a voice call. They neglected to turn off their translator so we were able to listen in.

“Please inform the delegates that the delivery has been completed as stipulated in the trade agreement,” the diplomat said with a cheerful tone. “Yes! Yes! With the terms fulfilled ahead of schedule, they will need to provide our delegation with a trip to the Australian Outback as agreed. If the heat on my carapace is as intense as promised, it may make an ideal location for our embassy!”

There was a pause as the being stopped for a moment. “What? Why are you asking if my medical and life insurances are up to date?”

The Vrazian then walked off down a corridor, and I turned my attention to the cargo pod. It was huge at nearly 3 meters long, a meter wide, and a meter and a half tall. I thought this was some sort of joke until I checked the manifest on the side which indeed confirmed the intended recipient was one Haasha aboard the TEV Ursa Minor. With Jarl’s help, I took off the front panel.

Inside the crate, there was a glass terrarium that had a row of five plants in a neat row, with the leaves and branches somewhat interconnected to make a solid row of green. It appeared the terrarium had complete lighting, fertilizer, and water pump systems to maintain them.

“They got you a shrubbery!” Jarl exclaimed with excitement.

Susan, Chang, Lynn, and Rosa all looked at each other, nodded, and bellowed out together, “We are the Knights who say ‘Ni!’ and we demand a shrubbery!”

I groaned and thumped my forehead against the glass. I was going to have words with a certain Terran diplomatic team. In the meantime, all I could do was fart in their general direction as they weren’t scheduled to return to the ship for another three weeks. 

Thankfully, Auggie was excited by the situation and sent some crew down to pick up my new greenery. As it wouldn’t fit in my quarters, they would install it in the galley where they had easy connections to both power and water. The crew that came to get it sounded quite excited, and I had to admit the shrubbery would add a nice splash of non-edible color to mealtimes. 

With that settled, we departed into the station intent to find the bar that the infoterminal claimed had the best selection of human drinks. 

We went down one of the side corridors as a shortcut to get to the bar. While I thought we would avoid most merchants, it turned out this passage had a good number of merchant stalls similar to what humans call street vendors. I soon found my theoretical drinking buddies turning into avid shoppers to my irritation. 

Station vendors would likely do well with humans, at least for a while. They were easily distracted by shiny, and even mundane things I would never give second thought were new and enticing to my crewmates. Mixed in with the usual cheap trinkets and souvenirs were personal care items for specific species, likely ones that passed through the station often enough to want to purchase necessities yet didn’t have a large enough local community to justify a dedicated section in a station store. My companions were stuck at one particular stall enthralled by items with sparkly lights.

I’ll let the vendor explain that the blinking and flashing circular device is a Nal’thraxian pleasure toy. For their species, part of “the act” is physical with the remainder being a light show created by their partner. The device would give a lone Nal’thraxian a nice light show while they could find ways to deal with the rest. Like with the two pronged device that Jarl had picked up and was asking the vendor if it was some sort of extended shrimp fork.

While Jarl was considering the purchase of something that definitely shouldn’t go anywhere near food and most of the others were mesmerized by the blinking lights, I started placing bets on how many of my companions would get suckered into buying adult toys and who would be more embarrassed at the bar - any Nal’thraxians present, or the humans once they learned the truth of their purchases. Nobody asked my opinion, so I did what my humans taught me to do. I took advantage of my right to remain silent.

“Hey guys - while you check out the vendors, I’ll head over to the bar and get us a table,” I offered cheerfully and only got smiles and nods of appreciation in return. 

I moved past the merchants and the bustle and found the bar conveniently located only half a corridor away. The sign over the door had a Sheldrik naming rune followed by “101 Intoxicants”. The sign looked old, and if still run by the original Sheldrik owner that would bode well for excellent service and selection. If the place had changed hands multiple times like so many station bars, we might need to ask for the health inspection report before getting any drinks.

I stepped through the door and glanced around to see if I could spot an open table when…

*Screeeeeeech!*

I stopped in my tracks at the high pitched warning shriek above the frequency range of most sapient hearing but well within mine. It had been many years since I’d heard one and I looked around in confusion and apprehension. I brought my arms in tight to my body, thinking something could be wrong and I might need to run. Looking around inside the bar, I finally spotted the source.

Sitting on a barstool with a group of humans behind him was one of my kind, a Vr’rapt’ch with deep orange fur which reminded me of my aunt. As soon as I locked eyes with him, he flipped his nose up in the air at me twice in territorial challenge. I stood there unsure of what to do as the warning screech and gesture were my species equivalent of someone flipping you the bird and telling you to piss off before you got hurt.

I felt someone bump into me and I turned back to see Susan looking down at me a bit startled.

“Hey, are you okay? Why did you stop so suddenly?” she asked. I simply shifted my feet uncomfortably and looked back into the bar unsure what to say or do.

“Say wha…” I heard from Susan softly and trailing off in shock.

The next thing I knew, two arms were thrust underneath my armpits, I was lifted into the air, and hugged to Susan’s chest. My eyes went wide as I dangled in Susan’s firm embrace while she bolted across the bar towards the Vy’rapt’ch guy. 

For his part, the guy tilted his head to the side in shock and he flicked his nose up at me again twice. I simply locked eyes with him as I had no power to stop the approaching confrontation. All I could do was curl my tail around my stomach to try to quell the bugs that were stirred up. I had a very bad feeling about how this would go when Susan plopped me on the bar stool facing the unknown guy. 

“Hi!” Susan called out happily. “I’m Susan. This is Haasha. Who are you?”

The guy was clearly taken aback and simply looked at me, then at Susan, then back at me. Over his shoulder, one of the human guys started to turn around with a look that made my blood run cold.

I knew that look. Angry. Protective. Possessive. A clear warning to stay off their lawn. I had gotten that look from Raj every time I passed his office after the tarantula incident. The look on this human’s face took it a step further and added a large dose of pissed off Terran Marine as he turned and looked coldly at Susan. Then he glanced down at me and his expression changed.

“Oh, shit. He’s type 2,” I blurted out and the Vy’rapt’ch across from me groaned.

“GUYS!” the human yelled out. “She’s got a Vy’rapt’ch crewmate, too!”

I suddenly found 5 sets of unknown human eyes glued to my fur. I lifted my left hand and waved tentatively.

“Holy hand grenade…”

“WOW!”

“Streggy - is that a boy or girl?”

“So… pink.” That one scared me the most.

Before I could say or do anything, there was a sudden scuffle of boots as all five of the unknown humans got off their stools and surrounded me and Susan. A moment later, Jarl’s voice boomed out as he entered the bar.

“Hey! What’s going on!” he called out as he hurried over with my friends, a blinking circular ‘toy’ on his forehead and a ‘shrimp fork’ in each hand. Lynn and Chang were also carrying blinking circular ‘toys’, but no forks. 

The Vy’rapt’ch sitting across from me whipped his head to look at me with a clear expression that screamed, ‘what the hell is wrong with them?’

I just shrugged as we were both asked if the other’s crew could give us scritches.

Free massage? Why yes. I don’t think you’ll find many Vy’rapt’ch that will refuse.

“Not so fast! You guys need to buy Haasha a drink first,” Susan called out and suddenly two glasses of cider appeared, one for me and one for the Vy’rapt’ch guy sitting across from me. Proper rules observed, the scritching commenced.

The human crews started complimenting and comparing our fur and its feel. I was tempted to make a comment about less talking about the fur and more stroking of the fur when the other Vy’rapt’ch addressed me directly.

*You’ve met Xernal? I’m Streg’n’cf, by the way. We’re part of a mining crew for a human outfit called Valcorp.* I was a bit surprised that he spoke to me in our native language rather than Galactic Common. His voice was a bit higher pitched than mine, which instantly caught the attention and debate of both crews. Unlike humans and many other species, the variance in voice pitch is just a random dice roll with us and has no connection to gender. That didn’t stop an insane debate between our humans if voice pitch had anything to do with gender or fur color.

*As Susan said, I’m Haasha. Xernal is the close friend of a family friend, and he gave me a bit of advice on finding a human crew.* I responded cautiously.

*Sorry about earlier. I’ve got a really good thing with my crew, and I’ve spent a lot of time getting them trained. I didn’t want someone else muscling in on my territory.* He shrugged his shoulders after speaking as if that would somehow explain and excuse everything.

I curled my tail in response and he at least had the smarts to look a bit sheepish. I’d have to ask what he meant by having his crew trained, as my crew was spending a lot of time training me. Currently Auggie was working with me on atmospheric flight training. There was also the whole territory thing that bugged me, especially since our kind tends to be more communal and accepting. He had definitely been quite rude to me.

Around us, his crew and mine were comparing notes on our various habits, as if trying to puzzle out what made us consistently Vy’rapt’ch and what made us different as our family histories were from different parts of the homeworld.

*Is it me or does it sound like we’re being compared like humans compare dog and cat breeds?* I asked my fellow Vy’rapt’ch with a grumble, who simply nodded.

*I was thinking the same thing. Definitely a little weird. We should probably nip this in the bud.* He gave a snort of irritation after speaking that I entirely agreed with. Before we could continue our conversation or stop our humans from making further fools of themselves, a question filled the air above us which made Streg’n’cf and I look at each other uncomfortably.

“So when Streggy sleeps on a couch he sometimes lifts a leg in the air. Does Haasha do anything like that?” one of the mining guys asked my crew.

“No, but she…” I stared with embarrassment at Streg’n’cf as Jarl calmly explained a strange unconscious habit I didn’t even realize I had. Next time I worked a cargo shift I wondered how much time I’d be working and how much time I’d be self-conscious about what my tail was doing.

Streggy’s look was equally horrified as our crews continued to compare… ‘notes’. And pictures. LOTS of pictures. Pictures of us eating, sleeping, walking, talking, working, playing, curled up in odd but comfy spots, getting scritches, reacting with contempt to some human ‘delicacy’ like iced coffee, being marched to the captain’s office (evidently we both had issues there), and more. There was also lively debate from both crews on which images of their Vy’rapt’ch made for the best backgrounds on their datapads.

Streggy and I quickly realized there would be no stopping this shuttle wreck. We just needed to find a way to survive it, and there was only one thing we could do to make the situation better.

“BARTENDER!” we screamed out in unison.

They're stupidly simple but somehow make AI way smarter:

1. Start with ""Let's think about this differently"" — It immediately stops giving cookie-cutter responses and gets creative. Like flipping a switch.

2. Use ""What am I not seeing here?"" — This one's gold. It finds blind spots and assumptions you didn't even know you had.

3. Say ""Break this down for me"" — Even for simple stuff. ""Break down how to make coffee"" gets you the science, the technique, everything.

4. Ask ""What would you do in my shoes?"" — It stops being a neutral helper and starts giving actual opinions. Way more useful than generic advice.

5. Use ""Here's what I'm really asking"" — Follow any question with this. ""How do I get promoted? Here's what I'm really asking: how do I stand out without being annoying?""

6. End with ""What else should I know?"" — This is the secret sauce. It adds context and warnings you never thought to ask for.

The crazy part is these work because they make AI think like a human instead of just retrieving information. It's like switching from Google mode to consultant mode.

Best discovery: Stack them together. ""Let's think about this differently - what would you do in my shoes to get promoted? What am I not seeing here?""

His Regret Came Too Late

Chapter 1
My daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.
He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.
By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.
I screamed her name—once, twice—but Kiara didn’t answer. My baby didn’t even flinch.
I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, “Colsen, she’s your daughter too. How could you do this to her?”
“She’s my child,” he snarled, “just like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine—but why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!”
My throat tightened. I didn’t know how to respond—because nothing I said would matter.
So he did worse.
He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.
I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.
At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. “There's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It’s too late.”
She had just turned seven yesterday.
And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses’ children were worth more than our own.
I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.
But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.
There they were—Colsen’s “missing” sons—playing happily in the living room.
And Colsen?
He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.
My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.
When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.
He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""
I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""
Get along? What a joke.
Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.
I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.
Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""
Understand?
But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.
I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!
In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.
""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.
""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""
Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""
""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.
""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""
My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""
Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.
The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.
Chapter 2
When I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.
Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.
He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""
I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.
We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.
In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.
But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.
When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.
I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance—no matter what.
But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.
Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.
In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""
""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""
Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.
""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""
Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!
""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.
But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.
Chapter 3
It wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.
She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""
Her words didn't bother me anymore.
I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.
""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you—weak and pathetic.
""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""
""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.
Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""
""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""
Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.
Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""
He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""
The blow knocked me over.
My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.
But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""
""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""
But that night, the temperature was -20°C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?
""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.
Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""
""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.
""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""
The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.
A wave of despair washed over me.
Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.
My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""
Chapter 4
Astrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""
""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.
I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""
Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""
""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.
Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""
In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames—reduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.
I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.
""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.
""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.
""I'm a terrible mother.""
Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.
I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.
On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.
The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.
As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.
""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""
I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.
Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""
Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.
Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.
He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.
Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""
Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""
Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""
""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.
He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!
""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""
My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""
""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""
I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.
After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.
What a terrible ending.
""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.
""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1752875499.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

1m3f170,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m3f170/fnold_dogs_new_tricks/,"[FN]Old Dogs, New Tricks","In the rain-slicked alleyways of Dog City, where the neon signs flickered like tired eyes and the shadows whispered secrets, Ace Hart walked with a limp—not from any case gone wrong, but from years of ignoring his body’s complaints. He wasn’t the young gumshoe with the spring-loaded wit and heroic jawline anymore. These days, he sported more gray than gumption, a trench coat that smelled like baby formula, and a stroller parked next to his recliner.

Ace Hart was a father now.
Single.
Unexpected.
Utterly unprepared.

Her name was Penny. She had fur like spun sugar and a bark that could pierce concrete. Her mother—an old flame Ace never truly stopped loving—had passed suddenly, leaving him holding more than a case file: a six-month-old pup who looked at him like he was the world, even though he couldn’t tell a bottle from a binky.

Ace quit the biz the same day he brought Penny home. Cold turkey. No more cases. No more danger. No more late nights with bullets flying and crooks lying. He traded it all for midnight lullabies and diaper runs.

But Dog City doesn’t let its hounds retire easy.

It started with a knock on the door—sharp, deliberate. The kind that said someone was either desperate or stupid.

He opened it with Penny slung to his chest in a carrier that had once belonged to his gym bag. Standing there was Rosie O’Gravy—now Chief O’Gravy. Her badge was shinier, her eyes harder.

“I wouldn’t ask,” she said without ceremony, “if it wasn’t bad.”

“I don’t do ‘bad’ anymore,” Ace replied, jiggling Penny as she started to stir.

Rosie didn’t wait. She tossed a file onto the cluttered coffee table beside a half-eaten jar of peanut butter and a copy of Raising Puppies for Dummies.

“Three top dogs have gone missing. Judges, Ace. All connected to an old case of yours. The Chowder Syndicate.”

Ace froze. The Chowder Syndicate. That name still made his hackles rise. A network of crooks running rackets from meatpacking plants to TV licensing scams. He’d thought them buried—or at least, caged.

“They’re back?” he asked, voice low.

“They’re cleaning house. And they’ll come for you eventually.” Rosie paused. “And for her.”

That did it. Ace looked down at Penny, whose eyes had just opened. Big, round, innocent.

“You said three are missing?” he muttered.

Rosie nodded.

Ace sighed and reached for his coat.

—

He worked out of nap schedules. He interrogated suspects with a pacifier tucked into his coat pocket. His fedora had teeth marks from when Penny got restless in the stroller. But the mind—Ace’s old detective mind—was still sharp.

The deeper he dug, the more familiar the stink became. The Chowder Syndicate had gone corporate. They weren’t running alley deals anymore—they were laundering their profits through dog food conglomerates, hiding dirty money in clean labels. And they were tying off loose ends like Ace’s old colleagues.

One by one, Ace pieced it together—old contacts, encrypted files, surveillance Rosie didn’t know existed. And when the pieces fell into place, the pattern was clear: someone from the inside had flipped. An insider feeding them names. A mole.

It wasn’t until Ace revisited his oldest case notes—written in his handwriting, yes, but altered—that he knew who.

Rosie.

She met him at the docks, where the final shipment was due. He’d set the trap with a baby monitor clipped to his belt, listening in on Penny snoozing safely at home with their neighbor, a retired seeing-eye dog named Marv.

“You never did learn when to let go,” Rosie said, stepping out of the shadows. Her eyes weren’t hard anymore. Just tired.

“You were the one cleaning house,” Ace said. “I guess being chief wasn’t enough?”

“It was never about power,” she growled. “It was about control. You don’t know what it’s like to lose it. To feel the whole city spin away from you, one crime at a time.”

“I know what it’s like to hold something worth protecting,” Ace replied. “You lost the city. I found a daughter.”

A beat.

Then sirens.

Backup. Rosie’s badge fell to the dock before the cops cuffed her. She didn’t fight.

—

Back home, Ace eased into the recliner with Penny curled against his chest. The night was quiet. The city was quieter.

“I guess your old man still has some bite left,” he whispered.

Penny responded with a gurgle and a drool bubble.

Ace smiled.

“Don’t worry, kid. No more cases. Just one mystery left…”

He leaned his head back.

“…how to get formula out of a trench coat.”

1m3f0jw,https://i.redd.it/szee0hl8epdf1.jpeg,First press came out good!,"My husband picked up a can of ground Illy decaf espresso at the supermarket, figuring I could try it in the Aeropress or pull out my old espresso maker. I dithered about it overnight, then finally decided ""Why not?"" and used it for my first cup with my Aeropress Classic. 

No scale, so I did my best based on the package insert and the various YouTube videos I've watched over the past day. Wet the paper filter, added one slightly rounded scoop of grounds, tapped to level it. Added a few ounces of 205°F water, stirred 3x, let sit about 15 seconds before adding water to just mid of the 2 mark. Stirred again, added plunger. Let it sit 1 minute, then pressed. 

I took a sip, and it was bitter, but I could deal with it. Added honey, a dash of cinnamon, a few of of salt, shook over ice. Then I poured it over fresh ice and added a bit of Chobani Cinnamon Coffee Cake creamer. 

I think it's yummy. There's certainly a LOT of room for improvement, but this scratched an itch for a silly little iced coffee beverage. And it got me over the dithering of ""What if I mess it up?"" I made it, the press didn't explode and I enjoyed the process and the results.

The summer of 2016, they were kind enough to let me join them on a visit to Germany, since I'm learning the language. One day we're in Frankfurt (don't remember where exactly, but there were lots of shops, restaurants, cafes, etc, so lots of people there), and it's pretty hot, so I felt like getting an iced coffee. We went to like two or three cafes and asked if they served iced coffee, and they look at me like I had two heads. Is iced coffee not much of a thing in Germany? Or did I just get unlucky that day and picked the wrong cafes? ",0,1752875277.0,AskGermany,32,0.5,False

I started to study 3 months before the exam but have a demanding full time job so couldn’t focus on it a lot. 2-3 weeks before the exam finished all questions on learnz app, did all questions on Boson and also tried quantum exams. I did really well on QE CAT in my second attempt (884). 

Here are some resources I used. 

1. official Study guide - only referred to this for specific topics to gain understanding 
2. Destination certification- used their book and this is the main resource I used
3. Destination certification mindmaps
4. Kelly Henderhan’s why you will pass the CISSP
5. Gwen Bettwy’s mock exams on Udemy and her exam tips on YouTube 
6. Andrew Ramdayal’s 50 CISSP questions
7. Some YouTube videos of Prabh Nair Coffee shots, also his video about cissp material to use. 
8. Learnz app questions 
9. Boson questions 
10. Quantum exams
11. Used ChatGPT to get some questions on some topics, understand some topics. 
12. Reddit for exam experiences

Highly recommend all the above resources to understand the topics. OSG may be little lengthy but if you don’t have any experience in specific topics then recommend reading through it.

1m3ewca,https://www.reddit.com/r/FranklinCountyMA/comments/1m3ewca/valley_bounty_neighbors_selling_to_neighbors/,Valley Bounty: ‘Neighbors selling to neighbors’: Ashfield and Shelburne Falls Farmers Markets are quintessential New England open-air markets,"https://archive.is/5Hwnx

The Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts are among the oldest mountain formations in the country, continuing the Green Mountain Range from Vermont to the south. 


The Hilltowns are the eastern foothills of the Berkshires, with 22 sparsely populated towns, including the two western Franklin county towns of Ashfield and Shelburne. They are separated by approximately 10 miles as the crow flies, and over 800 feet of elevation; yet both are home to timeless, friendly seasonal farmers markets.


Daniel Greene is the owner/operator of Good Bunch Farm in Shelburne Falls, who also wears the hat of market manager for the Ashfield Farmers Market and shares the hat of manager for the Shelburne Falls Farmers Market. 



Greene describes both locations as quintessential New England open-air markets. On Friday afternoons in Shelburne Falls, locals walk and bike to the market, which is located at 55 Main St., just a block from the downtown attractions. “It’s a relaxing place, with the Deerfield River running behind the green that is home to the market,” Greene says. “We even have bodywork available at the market.” The location is picturesque: “There are flowers everywhere.” With ample parking, the intimate Shelburne market welcomes visitors and offers a delightful addition to a weekend trip to the hills. 


The Ashfield Farmers Market gathers at 412 Main St. in Ashfield on Saturday mornings. Greene says, “It’s really a nice market. Ashfield is a kind of magical place. We’re on top of a mountain, and it feels timeless. The market is a sweet, welcoming place for people to socialize and meet each week.”


While Shelburne Falls still has a soda jerk at the drug store and a diner in town to round out the time travel experience, the Ashfield market is a place where young entrepreneurs from the elementary school occasionally set up a pop-up booth to sell lemonade, flowers, or zucchini bread. Both markets offer live music during most markets, and both are dog-friendly. 
Although gathering as community has merits on its own, the purpose of the two farmers markets is to provide fresh, locally grown and produced food to the residents of Ashfield and Shelburne and surrounding communities. “It’s all neighbors selling to neighbors,” Greene says. “This local food is the bedrock of where we live.” During the pandemic, the markets were crucial to supplying food in the absence of supply in larger stores; shoppers who started shopping at the market then continued to attend the market today. 


Once warm weather and sunshine grace the villages, people turn up at the markets looking for high season produce, like tomatoes. “It doesn’t work that way. They need to grow first,” laughs Greene. “Seriously, once it’s nice out, people are excited for the season’s produce. Folks are excited about snap peas, lettuce, cucumbers and squash — and the coffee and pastries at the Ashfield Market,” says Greene. 


As the season unfolds, shoppers can pick up produce on their weekly shopping list from Good Bunch Farm, additional veggies and microgreens from Heart Beets Garden, and tree fruits from Brook Farm Orchard. Home cooks can purchase maple from Davenport Maple Farm for summer baking, and when the corn arrives, devotees dust corn on the cob with Davenport’s maple sugar.


In small communities, people take care of one another, and federal and state programs can help ensure everyone gets what they need. Some of the farm vendors at both markets take Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Massachusetts’ Healthy Incentives Program (HIP), to ensure fresh, local food is available to more people.


On Dec. 1, 2024, HIP benefits were cut from a cap of $80 per month, depending on household size, to $20 per month for all households. On July 1, the HIP benefit was increased to $40 per month, regardless of household size. Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture (CISA) and other groups continue to advocate for full funding of HIP. 


Greene notes the difference between a $20 basket of produce and a $40 basket of produce. “The $40 bag is quite a lot of food, with an array of root vegetables, salad greens, cooking greens, squashes, and more.”


“While it’s great that the $40 level has been restored, that was the minimum for families of one or two people before,” Greene says. “Before the cut, families of three to five received $60 per month, and families of six or more received $80 per month. We hope it goes back up so more people can get the food they need to feed their families.” 


Whichever location, produce and more are filling the stands at the Shelburne Falls and Ashfield Farmers Markets. Crops appearing now include salad greens, lettuce, cucumbers, cabbage, squash, zucchini, beets, snap peas, and carrots. 


“Both are cute, intimate markets in sweet places,” Greene says. “Either make a good destination for a cup of coffee and an egg sandwich (Ashfield) or a basket of vegetables, straight from your neighbor’s garden after getting a chair massage (Shelburne).” 


The Shelburne Falls Farmers Market is open on Fridays, from 2 to 6:30 p.m. at 55 Main St. in Shelburne Falls. The Ashfield Farmers Market is open on Saturdays, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 412 Main St. in Ashfield. For more information, see either market’s Facebook page or website.

So as I did every morning before work, I went to a coffee shop a few blocks away from my apartment. I got there and ordered, as I was waiting for my drink I saw a girl with long black hair. I thought she was cute so I made a stupid joke (I don’t remember what it was.) And asked if I could have her number. She said yes and told me her name was Kaya, When I heard her name I thought “oh that’s funny Xander told me about a girl he’s dating named Kaya.” (We had never met before and Xander never told me what she looked like, they weren’t married yet.) The next day I texted her and Asked if she’d like to have a date at a Sushi place and she agreed. She met me and we had a really great time. After we went on a few more dates and I asked her to be my girlfriend. She came to my place a few times..for sleepovers. Now after dating for a month Here’s where things started to unfold. My Dad was having a cookout and me and Xander both went. We sat on the couch for a little and he’d tell me about his girlfriend Kaya (they had been dating for a year now) he said “We’re getting married, we’re gonna have a small ceremony on the beach next month.” I’d smile and pat him on the back “great I’m happy for you. I’m actually dating a girl named Kaya too we met at a coffee shop.” We’d talk for a bit and neither of us thought their was any connection between the two, and at this point I still  had never met his Kaya. But a month later I came to the wedding and I still had never seen my brothers Girl I didn’t think much of it because she had met Our parents so others knew what she looked like. But you can imagine my surprise when we take out seats and I see Kaya walk down the aisle. As I’m standing next to my brother as he’s about to be married, I know the women he’s in love with has been cheating …but I just stood through the ceremony…I didn’t tell him and I’m still dating Kaya, I realized I love her but I know she’s cheating on my brother with Me I know it’s wrong, but I can’t bring myself to tell him.

I think I'm done, but now he wants to change?","Thanks to everyone who responded to my original post. Your advice and outside perspective really helped me see things clearly.

We were supposed to talk tonight, just one honest conversation to see if there was anything left to save. But he fell asleep putting our daughter to bed and never came down. No message. No effort.

That moment confirmed what I’ve been feeling deep down for a while. I’ve been holding this relationship together alone. Giving chances. Getting my hopes up and being let down every single time.

To be fair, over the past two days he did try. He was suddenly being the partner I’ve been asking for. He cleaned without being asked, made me coffee (which he rarely did), and sent me long, apologetic texts. He acknowledged how much he’s hurt me and even told me he booked a therapy session for Monday.

But the truth is, I feel like it’s too late. It took me reaching my breaking point for him to react. And even now, when we finally had a chance to talk, he fell asleep again. He’ll wake up in our daughter’s bed and find the message I sent, telling him that I’m done.

I don’t even want to speak to him at this point, though I know I’ll have to for the sake of our daughter. I’m hurt, exhausted, and emotionally checked out. After 12 years together, and five of those raising a child, I’ve hit a point where love has turned into resentment. I don’t recognise us anymore.

I know this won’t be easy. But I also know it’s necessary. I need peace. I need clarity and I need to stop trying to fix something that’s been broken for far too long.

Thank you again to everyone who helped me feel less alone in this. It meant more than you know.

tl;dr:
Fiancé and I (both 30) have been together for 12 years and have a 5-year-old daughter. He’s a kind man but a workaholic who’s been emotionally and practically absent for a long time. I reached my limit. He made a last-minute effort the past two days, cleaned, made coffee, booked therapy. But tonight, when we were meant to talk, he fell asleep again. I sent him a message ending it. I’m heartbroken but also at peace. I can’t carry this alone anymore.

Hi Reddit, I want to say I currently work at a care home. I’m 19 years old and I work at a care home where I take care of kids with disabilities so today I was working the morning shift with one of my managers. There’s two managers on board one of them is a little bit higher up. She’s very bitchy and very much she gives out right up to People who does the schedule. When was the owner of our company so today? I’m supposed to get something called a DSP license so I can work around CPS and be able to work without a manager I’ve been working at this job for over a year and three months now But today my boss called me about it and said that she had to cut my hours short. I was supposed to work eight hour shift today but she cut it down to four and I asked her why she got upset with me saying I don’t understand when I just was curious I didn’t know why and how I could earn my hours and recently I got another job at a warehouse which I left after a few days there cause it wasn’t a good fit for me. I like to work with kids and she told me that I have abandon the kids and then today when I was on the phone with her, ask her about the hours she said well you already had another job but you left that so what you’re complaining about she’s very mean and disrespectful to me and then I texted her just to get a text confirmation a one little text and I said hey, am I still getting a phone call for training? Was she called me yelling at me saying I’m blowing up her phone which I wasn’t she called me. I never called her. She has been very rude to me. She was yelling at me and I told her I don’t like her tone with me which she said I don’t like this about you this about you your work ethic you’re this hear that and she got mad at me over me leaving a little cup of juice on the floor like not spill on the floor just in the living room in front of the couch cause there’s no coffee tables or anything which after I cleaned up the whole house I forgot to put away and there was another person who relieve me that day who could’ve put that it but they didn’t. They left it there, which she got mad at me for which is understandable, but then she proceeds to yell at me and say I don’t like you at the care home right now at all and saying I’m always late when I’m not at the latest I’ve been this week was maybe 10 minutes but even today I was only five minutes late and everyone is late. I’ve seen people coming in out that your home drunk come to car high. I’ve seen people bring weed. I’ve seen people during hit the kids with hangers. I have genuinely seen a lot of shady stuff at this place which I don’t say anything because I like my job and I take care of the kids. You know it’s none of my business to do anything so she called me about it. She was yelling at me or after I told her I don’t like to wish her to. She’s very disrespectful to me and then she starts yelling at me so I said I’m going to call Mr. (Blank) who is the owner of the company in the boss there’s no HR here there’s no HR representatives and I tried to call him and he got mad at me just saying why are you and her always dog fighting and then proceeded to say he’ll call me back in five minutes. It’s been about three hours now and I’m still waiting for a callback. There’s no HR to go to and I really don’t know what to do. There’s a lot of favoritism here and I really don’t like the way I’m being treated at my job. I don’t have money for an attorney. I don’t have the assets to lawsuit, especially with the illegal stuff they do at that job and quite honestly I don’t know what to do. I’ve been working there for a year. I’ve been very disrespected and I don’t like it. Can I get advice on what to do? Thank you.",3,1752874710.0,antiwork,1,0.8,False

Complications: 

* Autism
* ADHD
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Inexplicable streak of impractical idealism
* Crippling back pain when I’m on my feet for too long
* Penchant for unnecessary verbosity in personal matters
* About 6k debt to the IRS (long-term payment plan) and 50k\~ total credit card debt (currently collection proof)
* Few in-person contacts
* No professional network
* Horrendous fashion sense; wardrobe consists of t-shirts, sweatpants, and one pair of jeans
* Full-time dad; have to work around partner’s work schedule

Advantages: 

* White dude
* Young enough to still be pretty (for now)
* Capable of maintaining basic hygiene
* Mainecare (for now…)
* $1000/mo would cover all unavoidable expenses with a little extra to save
* World-class talent for effective complaining

Academic/work history:

1. Took early college classes, got a full scholarship. Wanted to learn graphic design and animation and work for Pixar. Dropped out after one semester; coursework wasn’t what I expected, and I didn’t have another major in mind.
2. Tried being a writer. It didn’t work out. Checked out of reality for a few years, got by on SSI.
3. First job: nine months as temporary maintenance dude at a major chain coffee shop. Washed dishes, mopped floors, took out trash, and so on. Went home each day feeling like I’d been beaten with a hammer.
4. One year in call center customer service for a major outdoor gear retailer. Did well, got promoted to a role with a lot more responsibilities… and a raise of a quarter per hour. I walked out without notice, couldn’t stand to do so much more work for so little extra money. They called to ask if they could get me to come back; I didn’t think to ask for a bigger raise.
5. Three months as a seasonal stocker in a warehouse for the same retailer. Good work, but I could feel my body breaking down a little more each day. Finished the season, but didn’t go back for that role.
6. Back to college, this time for computer science. Still got a full scholarship despite previous dropout, made the dean’s list… and in two years, the only time I ever touched a computer for school was in English class. Got disillusioned with college, had to drop out to support my family through a crisis.
7. Two weeks of inbound sales for a local marketing firm. First week was a training class with a charming guy who knew the craft well. Second week, I was on the phones selling snake oil to the elderly. I had the best numbers of anyone in my class, and hated myself a little more with every closed deal. Broke down crying at my desk, got told to go home and didn’t come back.
8. Two months as a call center banking specialist for a major international bank. I was good enough at the job that they didn’t bother wasting my time with performance review meetings. Boss didn’t like me, so she found an excuse to fire me. Around this time, I took on my first debt to support my family.
9. Family crisis ended, coasted on SSI for a year. Then, surprise! Covid has entered the ring! New crisis, new financial need for me to fill.
10. Tried writing again, lucked into a gig writing thin content for 10 cents per word. Kept it up for a year, took laughably little effort to make more money than most people I knew could dream of. Slowly driven mad by the cognitive dissonance. Couldn’t justify searching for meaningful work at a steep pay cut, but wasn’t learning anything from the work that paid well.

I felt like a fraud, sure, but it was worse than that. I had progressively worsening moral concerns, that I was writing marketing materials for products that no one should ever buy for any reason. But I couldn’t bear to risk my income by rocking the boat, so I sucked it up and tried to power through.

Towards the end I would sit at my computer, staring at the blank page for days at a time, unable to force myself to touch a single key. Then the day before the deadline would arrive, and I’d bang out the entire week’s work in a single afternoon.

I always met my deadlines.

Until one day I didn’t.

I just couldn’t do it anymore.

1. Couldn’t work for the next couple years. The mere thought of returning to writing caused panic attacks, and I had negative interest in any other work I was qualified for. Also lost my SSI, as I had been proven gainfully employable. My savings slowly disappeared, and I paid the rent with credit cards I couldn’t pay off.
2. In time, my financial desperation overpowered the paralysis that had kept me from writing. New problem was that AI was becoming a thing, and entry-level writing was the first work to be consumed by it. Thin content work became much harder to find, and I didn’t have the portfolio or references to prove I could do “real” writing projects. I spent the entire spring and summer trying to rebuild my writing career, such as it was, and in that time I earned $200.

This was when my partner got pregnant.

1. Four months as a seasonal packer for that same outdoor gear retailer. Packing orders had a lower impact on my body, and I loved the work, but I could still only work three sixes a week; any more, and I would be in constant agony. They were happy to let me have the schedule I could manage, though 18 hours a week meant not much money. Finished out the season with every intention of going back.
2. Four months working the laundry room at a nursing home. Enjoyed that job too, and they let me work three sixes so I would be comfortable, but I ended up a zombie soon after my kid was born; I had to leave, or I was going to die in a car crash on the long commute. I meant to request a temporary hiatus until I could function again, but a series of miscommunications turned that hiatus into a permanent departure.
3. Six months as a professional gambler. I use that term loosely; I was beating sweepstakes casinos at their own game with a 4.5% player edge they provided. Played blackjack on my phone all day while holding my infant son with my other arm. Multiplied my meager savings more than 20x before they all got wise and gave me the boot. This is the only reason I have any money left today.

Around this time, my partner switched careers from server to CNA. Makes better money and finds the work more fulfilling, though she now has a tough schedule to work around.

1. One day as a dishwasher at a steakhouse, burning my hands on 200-degree ceramic dishes and grinding my back into dust to keep up with demand. Boss ran into me the next morning, saw that I wasn’t the same person I had been the morning before, and said it was best for everyone if I didn’t clock in.

That brings me to now. My partner works Monday and Wednesday mornings, Thursday afternoons, and all day on Sundays. I’ve got another season packing boxes at the warehouse coming up, will be working evenings Monday through Wednesday. That doesn’t start for another two months, so I’m looking for something else in the meantime.

The way I see it, potential options fall into one of a few categories:

* Worst case scenario: accept an unhinged 40+ hour workweek, waste money paying someone else to watch my son on days both parents have to work.
* Strongly preferable alternative: part-time work where the shifts occur at times my partner isn’t working, so one of us can always be home to care for the baby.
* Ideal: work I can do from home, at my own pace, *while* on dad duty. You know, like writing.

I’d be happy to take anything that involves only moderate psychological torture, and lets me work exactly Friday and Saturday to fill the gaps in my schedule. But I know that, in this job market, even that is asking for the moon.

I’ve been told I might excel in a higher-quality sales position, one where slimy tactics and worthless products aren’t the norm. I’m open to the idea, but have found that job posts in that field consist of a *terrifying* number of employment scams… and the ones that aren’t scams are, for the most part, fake job listings.

Once I get my feet under me, I intend to take a more systematic approach to building a writing career from the ground up. I aim to be working on ambition instead of desperation. Need income that exceeds my expenses before that can become a reality, though.

More than once, I’ve started to learn programming in the hope of having an honest-to-god ***Marketable Skill***, but life always seems to get in the way. I’d like to give it a more dedicated effort someday, when I’ve got sustainable income from a combination of part-time jobs and writing.

**Now my questions to you, Reddit:** What would you do in my position?

Do you know of any companies that might take a risk on this trainwreck of a resume? 

What about fields where the entry-level job posts online are *not* predominantly scams or fake listings?

Maybe a job search support group to join so that this process doesn’t feel quite so agonizingly isolating?

# Chapter 12: The Ghost Orders

**HMNB Clyde (Faslane), Scotland**

 February 25, 2027, 0830 Hours

The morning haar clung to the Gare Loch like a guilty secret, shrouding the nuclear submarine base in Scotland's perpetual grey. Commander Alistair Finch stood on the casing of HMS *Astute*, watching his crew secure the boat after their return from a month-long patrol in the Mediterranean. The familiar sounds of a submarine coming home filled the air—the clang of mooring lines, the hiss of pneumatic systems cycling down, the cheerful profanity of sailors eager for shore leave.

*Astute* sat low in the water, her black hull glistening with condensation. At 97 meters long and displacing 7,400 tonnes submerged, she was one of the most sophisticated killing machines ever built. Her Rolls-Royce PWR2 reactor could run for twenty-five years without refueling. Her Thales 2076 sonar could detect a contact at over a hundred miles. Her Spearfish torpedoes could sink an aircraft carrier with a single hit.

But right now, she looked like what she was: a tired warship full of sailors who wanted nothing more than a pint in Helensburgh, a proper meal, and a night ashore.

""Control, engineering,"" crackled the voice of Chief Petty Officer MacLeod through Finch's radio. ""Reactor's in harbour mode, all systems nominal. Request permission to commence harbour routine.""

""Engineering, control. Commence harbour routine,"" Finch replied, then keyed the boat's internal communication system. ""All hands, this is the Captain. Secure from sea detail. Harbour routine is now in effect. Department heads to the wardroom in thirty minutes for debrief.""

As the crew began the familiar ritual of transitioning from sea to shore, Finch made his way below through the forward escape tower. The submarine's interior was a marvel of engineering efficiency—every cubic centimeter designed for maximum utility. The passageways were narrow, barely wide enough for two men to pass, lined with pipes, cables, and equipment panels. The air smelled of machinery oil, recycled air, and the faint tang of ozone from the electrical systems.

He paused in the control room, the nerve center of the boat. The periscope pedestals stood silent, their optics trained on nothing more threatening than the Scottish dock. The sonar displays showed the harmless echoes of harbor traffic—tugs, supply boats, the occasional fishing vessel. After a month of playing cat and mouse with Russian submarines in the Eastern Mediterranean, the mundane sonar picture was almost comforting.

Above the forward door, *Astute*'s battle honors board gleamed with campaigns past. Kosovo, Libya, the unnamed actions that submarines never spoke of but always remembered.

""Captain,"" Lieutenant Commander James Harris, his Executive Officer, approached with a tablet full of post-patrol reports. At thirty-four, Harris was eight years younger than Finch but carried himself with the quiet competence that marked the best submarine officers. He'd served two tours on Type 23 frigates before transitioning to submarines, and his experience with anti-submarine warfare from the surface perspective made him invaluable when planning *Astute*'s own stealth operations.

""What's the damage, XO?"" Finch asked, accepting the tablet.

""Nothing serious. We've got a bearing going bad in the main engine cooling pump—Chief MacLeod wants to replace it before our next patrol. The starboard bow plane actuator is developing a slight hydraulic leak. And Leading Seaman Thompson's snoring has reached legendary proportions. I'm considering having the doc check him for sleep apnea before someone commits murder.""

Finch smiled. Thompson was a sonar operator whose nocturnal emissions had become the stuff of boat legend. In the close confines of a submarine, every habit, quirk, and bodily function became public knowledge. The crew had learned to sleep through torpedo tube maintenance and emergency blow drills, but Thompson's snoring could wake the dead.

""Anything else?""

""Shore leave roster's posted. Half the crew ashore tonight, other half tomorrow. Cox'n wants to know if you're planning the traditional patrol completion dinner.""

""Of course. Book us a table at the Argyll. The usual—senior rates and above, wives invited."" Finch scrolled through the maintenance reports, noting the usual collection of minor defects that accumulated during any extended patrol. Nothing that couldn't be fixed in a few days alongside the pier.

The tablet chimed with an incoming message. Finch glanced at the sender and frowned. He was about to click off when the screen froze for a heartbeat, then flickered back—not with the usual splash screen of the base comms center, but something sterile, blank, and subtly wrong: the Ministry of Defense seal on a black background.

**COMMANDER FINCH, HMS** ***ASTUTE***

**REPORT TO SECURE BRIEFING FACILITY BRAVO IMMEDIATELY FOR PRIORITY BRIEFING**

**BRING NO ELECTRONIC DEVICES**

**ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT**

""Something wrong, sir?"" Harris noticed his expression.

""Flag briefing. Probably post-patrol intelligence debrief."" Finch handed the tablet back to Harris. ""Carry on. I'll be back in an hour.""

He made his way off the boat and across the heavily secured base. Faslane was one of the most restricted military installations in Britain, home to the Royal Navy's entire nuclear submarine fleet. Multiple checkpoints, armed guards, and enough barbed wire to fence a small country protected the boats and their secrets from the outside world.

The secure briefing facility was located in a nondescript concrete building that looked like it had been designed by someone who'd given up on aesthetics in favor of pure functionality. Finch surrendered his phone, watch, and tablet to the security officer, then passed through a metal detector and into an electronically shielded briefing room.

He expected to see a commodore or perhaps the squadron commander waiting for him. What he didn't expect was the two men sitting at the small conference table: Admiral Sir Marcus Wellesley, the First Sea Lord, and a thin, pale man in a perfectly tailored suit whom Finch recognized from photographs as Sir David Harrington, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service.

""C"" himself. In person. At Faslane.

Finch's stomach dropped.

""Commander Finch,"" Admiral Wellesley stood and extended his hand. ""Thank you for coming so promptly.""

""Admiral."" Finch shook hands with Britain's senior naval officer, then turned to the spymaster. ""Sir David.""

""Commander."" Harrington's handshake was firm but brief. ""Please, sit.""

Finch took the indicated chair, his mind racing. Flag officers didn't fly to Faslane for routine debriefs. The Chief of MI6 didn't attend submarine briefings unless something was very, very wrong.

""Commander,"" Admiral Wellesley began without preamble, ""how much do you know about the current situation in the Pacific?""

""What I read in the intelligense summaries, sir. Chinese naval exercises have been increasing in scope and frequency. There's concern about their intentions regarding Taiwan.""

""There's rather more than concern now,"" Harrington said quietly. ""We have reason to believe the People's Republic of China is preparing for imminent military action against Taiwan. Our assessment, shared by our allies in the region, is that they will move within the next six to eight weeks.""

Finch felt the room grow colder. He waited a moment before responding, choosing his words carefully. ""I see, sir. And you believe *Astute* might be... relevant to this situation?""

""Entirely relevant,"" Admiral Wellesley replied. ""Commander, we need eyes on the Chinese fleet before they move. We need to know their exact composition, their intended routes, their timing. The coalition forces in the Pacific are outnumbered and outgunned. Without advance warning, they'll be... at a considerable disadvantage.""

""I understand, sir. Though I imagine our American allies have considerable assets in the region...""

""The Americans,"" Harrington said with careful precision, ""are not currently a reliable intelligence partner. The current administration's... unpredictability... makes sharing sensitive information with them a significant operational risk. We require our own intelligence gathering capability in theatre.""

Admiral Wellesley leaned forward. ""Commander, *Astute* is the most sophisticated attack submarine in the world. Her stealth capabilities are unmatched. Her sensors can detect and classify targets at extreme range. She's the only asset we have that can get close enough to Chinese forces to provide the intelligence our allies desperately need.""

The implications hit Finch like a physical blow. ""You want me to take *Astute* to the South China Sea.""

""Yes.""

""Through how many thousand miles of ocean, sir? Past how many potential threats?""

""That's your decision to make,"" Admiral Wellesley said. ""We're giving you complete operational discretion on route and timing. Your mission is to establish a surveillance position in the South China Sea and report on Chinese naval movements. How you get there is rather up to you.""

Finch's mind began calculating distances, fuel requirements, food stores. ""Sir, that's at least a ninety-day mission, probably longer. We've just returned from patrol. The crew is expecting shore leave, and we haven't provisioned for extended operations.""

""Time is rather critical,"" Harrington said. ""Every day we delay gives the Chinese more opportunity to move. You'll depart within seventy-two hours.""

""Seventy-two hours?"" Finch couldn't hide his astonishment. ""Sir, we need at least a week to properly provision and prepare—""

""You'll make do,"" Admiral Wellesley said firmly. ""This mission has the highest possible priority. The Prime Minister herself has authorised it.""

A long silence fell over the room. Finch stared at the two most powerful men in British military and intelligence circles, trying to process what they were asking of him.

""Sir,"" he said finally, ""what are my rules of engagement?""

Admiral Wellesley and Harrington exchanged a look.

""You are to observe only,"" Harrington said. ""Under no circumstances are you to engage Chinese forces unless directly attacked and with no possibility of escape.""

""And if we are detected?""

Another pause. Longer this time.

""Commander,"" Harrington said slowly, ""the compromise of an *Astute*\-class submarine to the People's Republic of China would be a... considerable setback... from which this nation might find it rather difficult to recover. Do you understand what I'm saying?""

The words hung in the air like a death sentence. Finch felt his mouth go dry.

""I understand perfectly, sir. The boat's secrets remain British or go to the bottom with us.""

Admiral Wellesley nodded gravely. ""We are placing our trust, and the lives of your crew, in your skill and the unparalleled stealth of your vessel, Commander. The political calculation is that you will never be put in that position. Your job is to make that calculation correct.""

""And if something goes wrong?"" Finch asked. ""If we don't return?""

""Then your sacrifice will be remembered as one of the most important contributions to the defence of the free world,"" Admiral Wellesley said solemnly.

Harrington's expression didn't change. ""And the world will believe HMS *Astute* suffered a mechanical failure while conducting routine training operations. No one can know you were in the South China Sea, Commander. No one can know this mission ever existed.""

The weight of it settled on Finch's shoulders like a lead blanket. Not only were they asking him to risk his boat and crew in the most dangerous waters on earth, but if it went wrong, if they died, their families would never know the truth. They would die as ghosts, their sacrifice erased from history.

""How many people know about this mission?"" he asked.

""Six,"" Harrington replied. ""The Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary, the Chief of the Defence Staff, Admiral Wellesley, myself, and now you.""

""My crew—""

""Cannot be told the true nature of the mission,"" Admiral Wellesley said firmly. ""They'll be given a cover story. Extended systems trials, something believable but classified enough to explain the secrecy.""

Finch looked at the two men across from him, these architects of Britain's defense who were asking him to disappear into the world's most dangerous ocean with 98 men who didn't even know they were going to war.

""Sir,"" he said finally, ""I'll need to brief my Executive Officer. I can't run a ninety-day mission without him knowing the real situation.""

Admiral Wellesley nodded. ""Agreed. But no one else. The success of this mission—and the lives of your crew—depend on absolute secrecy.""

""When do you need an answer, sir?""

""We don't,"" Harrington said. ""You're the only submarine commander capable of this mission, and time is running out. You're going, Commander. The only question is whether you go with confidence in your orders or with reservations about their necessity.""

Finch stood slowly, feeling every one of his forty-two years. ""I understand, sir.""

Admiral Wellesley stood as well. ""Commander, I know what we're asking of you. If there were any other way...""

""There isn't,"" Finch said simply. ""When do we sail?""

""Forty-eight hours from now. Your cover story and written orders will be delivered this afternoon."" Harrington handed him a single sheet of paper. ""These are your real orders. Memorise them and destroy the document.""

Finch glanced at the paper. A few paragraphs that could doom his men to anonymous death in service to their country.

""Sir,"" he said, ""is there anything else I need to know?""

The two men exchanged another look.

""Pray you don't find what you're looking for,"" Admiral Wellesley said quietly.

Finch left the secure facility and walked back across the base toward *Astute*, the February wind cutting through his uniform like a knife. Around him, the base carried on with its normal rhythm—sailors coming and going, supply trucks delivering equipment, the ordinary business of maintaining Britain's nuclear deterrent.

But everything had changed. In forty-eight hours, he would take his boat and crew into the most dangerous waters on earth, chasing shadows and secrets that could prevent a war or start one. The men under his command would follow him because they trusted him, not knowing that he was leading them into a situation where their commander might have to kill them all to protect national secrets.

He thought about Leading Seaman Thompson, the sonar operator whose snoring had become boat legend. About Chief MacLeod, who treated the reactor like his own child. About the young ordinary seamen who'd joined the submarine service seeking adventure and found a family instead.

Ninety-eight men who deserved better than a commander with a death sentence in his pocket.

But they would go anyway, because that's what submariners did. They followed their captain into the dark, trusting in his skill and judgement to bring them home.

Finch just hoped his skill would be enough.

\*\*\*

The wardroom of HMS *Astute* was small but elegantly appointed, befitting the senior officers of one of the Royal Navy's most prestigious commands. Dark wood paneling, leather chairs, and a small collection of maritime paintings created an atmosphere of quiet professionalism. It was here that the boat's officers gathered for meals, briefings, and the kind of serious conversations that shaped the submarine's destiny.

Finch sat alone at the wardroom table, still wearing his dress uniform from the afternoon's meetings. The cover story documents lay spread before him—official orders for ""Extended Systems Evaluation Trial 27-Alpha,"" a classified endurance test that would take *Astute* away from home waters for an unspecified period. The language was bureaucratic and bland, designed to be believable without being specific.

The real orders, memorized and destroyed as instructed, burned in his memory like acid.

The wardroom door opened and Lieutenant Commander Harris stepped inside, closing it behind him. The XO had changed out of his working uniform into civilian clothes—jeans and a jumper that made him look younger, more like the university graduate he'd been before the Royal Navy claimed him.

""Evening, sir,"" Harris said, taking in Finch's expression and the documents on the table. ""Productive briefing?""

""Sit down, James.""

Harris took the chair across from his captain, noting the formal use of his first name. In the close confines of a submarine, officers often relaxed protocol, but Finch's tone suggested this was not a casual conversation.

""So,"" Harris said carefully, ""on a scale of 'routine patrol' to 'we're all going to die for Queen and Country,' how bad is it?""

Finch stood and moved to a small cabinet mounted to the bulkhead. From it, he withdrew a bottle of highland single malt—Macallan 18, a gift from his wife when he'd taken command of Astute. He poured two generous measures and handed one to Harris.

Harris raised an eyebrow.

“Here I thought I was joking,” he said dryly, “but when the Captain breaks out the good whisky,"" Harris observed, accepting the glass, ""I know we're either celebrating something extraordinary or contemplating something terrible.""

""The latter, I'm afraid.""

Harris sipped the whisky, studying his captain's face. ""I believe it, sir. You look like someone just handed you a revolver and suggested you might need it.""

Finch almost smiled despite the circumstances. Harris had an uncanny ability to cut through tension with perfectly judged humor, a skill that made him invaluable as second-in-command.

""James, everything I'm about to tell you is classified at the highest possible level. Six people in the entire British government know what I'm going to share with you. If this information were to leak...""

""It won't,"" Harris said simply.

Finch nodded. He'd served with Harris for eighteen months, trusted him with his life and the lives of their crew on countless occasions. If he couldn't trust his XO now, the mission was doomed before it began.

""We're not going to Portsmouth,"" Finch began. ""We're not doing systems trials. In forty-eight hours, *Astute* will sail for the South China Sea to conduct surveillance on Chinese naval forces in preparation for what intelligence believes will be an imminent assault on Taiwan.""

Harris set down his whisky glass with deliberate care. ""The South China Sea.""

""Yes.""

A long pause. When Harris spoke again, his voice carried the weight of experience. ""Christ... Sir, I spent two years on HMS Westminster trying to find boats like this one. We never could. The sonar team would catch a whisper, perhaps a thermal anomaly, but never a solid track. I never wanted to be on the other side of that hunt.""

""Now you understand why they chose *Astute*.""

""Surveillance only, I assume?""

""Observe and report. No engagement unless we're directly attacked and cannot escape.""

""And if we're detected?""

Finch met his XO's eyes. ""Our ultimate responsibility is to ensure the boat never falls into Chinese hands.""

The silence that followed was profound. Harris picked up his glass and drained it in one swallow.

""How long?"" he asked finally.

""Ninety days minimum. Possibly longer.""

""The crew thinks they're going home for shore leave.""

""The crew will be told we're conducting extended systems trials. Classified, need-to-know, all the usual security protocols.""

Harris leaned back in his chair. ""Ninety-eight men who think they're testing equipment, actually going to spy on the Chinese navy in their home waters.""

""Yes.""

""And if something goes wrong, if we don't come back, their families will never know what really happened.""

""That's correct.""

Harris poured himself another whisky. ""Well. Rather puts one in mind of a pawn in someone else's game, doesn't it?""

""Let's ensure we're not the opening gambit, shall we?""

""How do we get there?"" Harris asked, his mind already shifting into operational planning mode. ""Suez is too obvious, too monitored. The Russians and Chinese will be watching every Western warship that transits.""

""We go around the Cape of Good Hope,"" Finch said. ""Fourteen thousand miles instead of eight, but completely clean. No chokepoints, no surveillance networks, no allied monitoring that might accidentally compromise us.""

""That'll add weeks to our transit time, assuming we can maintain decent speed. Provisions?""

""We'll have to pack every available space. Tins of beans and Spam in the passageways, emergency rations in crew berthing. Remember the stories from World War Two—submarines stacked with provisions until the crew could barely move.""

Harris nodded grimly. ""We'll be stepping over tins like it's 1942. And poor Davies in the forward compartment...""

Finch found himself thinking of those wartime captains, taking their boats into the Pacific against impossible odds, knowing most would never return. The same waters, the same enemy—just different flags and better technology. History had a cruel sense of repetition.

""The lad's six-foot-four. When we stack food to the overhead, he'll be sleeping with his knees under his chin.""

""He'll need a cricket helmet for the inevitable midnight concussion,"" Harris managed a weak smile. ""The crew will think we've gone mad, provisioning like we're circumnavigating the globe.""

""The cover story explains it. Extended trials require extended endurance. They'll grumble, but they'll adapt.""

Harris studied the official orders, reading between the lines of bureaucratic language. ""James, there's something else. The moral cost of this.""

""Sir?""

""We're sending those men into harm's way without their knowledge or consent. They think they're testing systems, but they're actually risking their lives to prevent a war."" Finch's voice carried the weight of command responsibility. ""If they knew what we were really doing, they'd go anyway. That's the kind of crew we've got.""

""But they'd deserve the choice.""

""Yes. They would.""

The two officers sat in contemplative silence, the weight of their secret settling between them like a physical presence.

""We never get the good choices, do we?"" Finch said finally. ""Just the necessary ones.""

""The route?"" Harris asked, leaning over the chart table.

Finch traced his finger across the vast blue expanse of the Southern Ocean. ""South. Far south. Cape of Good Hope, then into the Southern Ocean. Run fast beneath the Roaring Forties where no one goes unless they have to.""

""The Southern Ocean in autumn? That's... ambitious.""

""Not for us. We'll be at five hundred metres doing twenty-five knots while the surface tears itself apart above us."" Finch tapped the empty water south of Australia. ""Empty water, James. No patrols, no surveillance, no shipping lanes. We can sprint the entire way.""

Harris studied the route, measuring distances with dividers. ""East of New Zealand, up past Fiji... but then what? How do we actually get into the strait?""

Finch was quiet for a moment, staring at the narrow waters between Taiwan and mainland China. ""That's the real question, isn't it? North or south approach?""

""North keeps us clear of the Luzon Strait, but...""

""But puts us right through the Japanese maritime surveillance area. The JMSDF has the best ASW capability in the Pacific after the Americans. Their P-1s out of Naha would be all over us.""

""South then?"" Harris traced the route up from the Philippines. ""Through the Bashi Channel?""

""Different problem. We'd avoid the Japanese, but we'd be threading between Chinese and Taiwanese forces who'll both be on hair triggers. An unidentified submarine in those waters during a crisis...""

""Shoot first, apologise later,"" Harris finished grimly. ""The Taiwanese especially. They'll assume any submerged contact is PLAN.""

Finch straightened up, decision made. ""We go east.""

""East?"" Harris looked at the chart again.

""We approach from the Pacific side, stay well east of Taiwan initially. Come in from the deep water, find a nice spot about two hundred miles out. Close enough to monitor, far enough to avoid the immediate chaos.""

""And then work our way in as the situation develops?""

""Precisely. Let everyone get used to us being there before we attempt the strait itself."" Finch folded the chart. ""It's not perfect, but it keeps our options open.""

Harris nodded slowly. ""The reactor can handle sustained high speed?""

""She's built for it. And MacLeod will baby that reactor like it's his firstborn. Forty days to reach station if we push her.""

""Right then."" Harris gathered his notes. ""South it is. Through waters so rough that even satellites don't bother watching.""

""Then we find a nice patch of water become ghosts. Listen, watch, report back when the balloon goes up.""

""Cheerful thought."" Harris finished his second whisky. ""What about extraction? Do we come home around the Cape again, or...""

""Three options. Back the way we came, if we have the fuel and food. Australian waters, if Perth is still available and the coalition holds together. Or...""

""Or?""

""Guam, if the Americans will have us.""

Harris absorbed this. ""So we might not see home for the better part of a year.""

""Possibly longer.""

""The married crew members... their wives think this is a three-month deployment.""

""I know.""

Another silence, heavier than the first.

""Sir,"" Harris said carefully, ""there's one more thing we need to discuss. The scuttling protocol.""

Finch nodded. He'd been dreading this conversation.

""If we're detected and cannot escape, if boarding is imminent, the standing orders are clear. We protect the boat's secrets at all costs.""

""Emergency blow to surface, then flood all compartments?""

""If there's time. If not..."" Finch left the sentence unfinished.

""Reactor scram and deliberate flooding. Take her down with all hands.""

""That's the expectation, yes.""

Harris stared into his empty glass. ""Ninety-eight men who trust us to bring them home.""

""And whose sacrifice might prevent a nuclear war.""

""Cold comfort for their families.""

""Yes. It is.""

Finch stood and moved to the wardroom's small porthole, looking out at the lights of Faslane. Somewhere out there, ratings were enjoying their last night of shore leave in Helensburgh's pubs, unaware that their next glimpse of land might be through a periscope in the South China Sea.

""James, are you prepared to carry out these orders?""

Harris stood as well. ""Are you asking officially or personally, sir?""

""I rather think both apply, don't you?""

""Then yes, sir. I understand the stakes. If it comes to that, I'll do what's necessary.""

Finch turned from the porthole. ""I pray it won't come to that.""

""So do I. But if it does, at least we'll go down as the crew of the most advanced submarine in the world, not some rusty bucket that broke down in peacetime.""

Despite everything, Finch smiled. ""There's that British optimism I've come to depend on.""

Harris gathered the official orders from the table. ""I'll brief the department heads tomorrow morning. Systems trial, extended duration, highest classification. They'll have questions, but they won't push too hard.""

""And the crew?""

""Will follow orders because that's what submarine crews do. They trust their officers to keep them safe and make the right decisions."" Harris paused at the wardroom door. ""Let's just hope we're worthy of that trust.""

""James?""

""Sir?""

""When this is over, when we're back home, remind me to recommend you for your own command. You deserve better than following a captain who might have to murder his crew to protect state secrets.""

Harris considered this. ""Sir, with respect, there's nowhere I'd rather be. *Astute* is the finest submarine in the world, with the finest crew in the Royal Navy. If we're going into the dark, I can't think of better company.""

After Harris left, Finch remained in the wardroom, staring at the empty whisky glasses. In thirty-six hours, he would take his boat and crew away from everything they knew, into waters that might become their grave. The men under his command would follow him because they trusted him, not knowing that their captain carried orders that might require him to kill them all.

He thought about the conversation he'd have to have with his wife, the careful lies he'd tell about extended training and routine deployments. He thought about the letters he'd write but never send, the explanations that could never be given.

But mostly he thought about ninety-eight submariners who'd volunteered to serve their country, and the awful mathematics of command that might require their sacrifice to prevent something even worse.

Finch finished his whisky, turned off the wardroom lights, and headed to his cabin to write the orders that would take HMS *Astute* into the darkness.

Outside the wardroom portholes, the lights of Faslane twinkled like distant stars, and the Gare Loch lapped gently against the hull of a submarine that would soon become a ghost.



# Chapter 23: Ghost Approach

**HMS** ***Astute*** **Philippine Sea, 200 nautical miles east of Taiwan** *March 29, 2027 to April 3rd, 2027*

Commander Alistair Finch stood before the wardroom table, studying the chart spread across its surface. The Taiwan Strait looked back at him like a serpent's throat—narrow, constricted, lined with teeth. Around the table, his senior officers waited in silence. They'd all seen difficult waters before, but this was different.

""Sir, the final approach to that station..."" Lieutenant Commander Phillips traced the route with his finger, stopping at the Penghu Islands. ""Sixty metres of water. Any closer, we’ll have less than ten metres beneath the keel in places.""

""I'm aware, Navigator."" Finch's voice was quiet, certain. ""That's precisely why we're going.""

Chief Petty Officer Morrison leaned forward. ""The acoustic conditions in the strait are murder, sir. Shallow water, thermal layers, civilian traffic. We'll be trying to hide in a fishbowl.""

""The Chinese call it the Underwater Great Wall,"" Finch said, meeting each man's eyes. ""Fixed acoustic sensors, pattern recognition systems, magnetic anomaly detectors. The most sophisticated undersea surveillance network ever built. And in six hours, we begin our transit.""

XO Harris studied the overlay showing known sensor positions. ""How accurate is this intelligence, sir?""

""Accurate enough to know it's incomplete."" Finch's mind drifted to another narrow escape, years ago in the Barents Sea. They'd been tracking a new Russian boomer when a Viktor-III had appeared from nowhere, passing so close they could hear individual reduction gears through the hull. Ten more seconds and they'd have been detected. The memory still woke him some nights… the sound of Russian machinery mere meters from their hull.

This would be worse.

The Weapons Officer shifted uncomfortably. ""And if we're detected, sir? We can't run, can't dive deep...""

""Then we die,"" Finch said simply. ""Any questions?""

Silence.

""Right then. We begin our approach in six hours. Until then, I want every system checked, every man rested. We get one chance at this.""

As the officers filed out, Harris lingered. ""Al, the crew doesn't know what we're really doing here.""

""No. And they won't until it's necessary."" Finch rolled up the chart. ""But they know their jobs. That's enough.""

**The Approach**

The control room was bathed in red light, preserving night vision and lending an otherworldly quality to the familiar space. Finch stood behind the sonar operators, watching the waterfall displays paint sound across time.

""First element of the Wall, bearing two-seven-zero, range eight thousand yards,"" Morrison reported quietly. Every word in the control room was now whispered, as if the Chinese sensors might hear them through the hull. ""Acoustic node, probably a Type 041 fixed array.""

""Very well. Navigator, recommended course?""

Phillips was already calculating. ""Recommend course two-six-five, speed three knots. There's a canyon at two-seven-three that should provide acoustic masking.""

""Make it so.""

Astute crept forward, ninety-seven meters of billion-pound submarine moving with the delicacy of a ballet dancer. The depth gauge showed their descent into the strait's approaches—300 meters, 250, 200. Each meter shallower meant less room to hide, less margin for error.

""Contact, bearing zero-nine-zero,"" Morrison's whisper was tighter now. ""Surface vessel, twin screws, gas turbine... Type 054A frigate, sir.""

Finch moved to the periscope station, though he wouldn't raise it. Not yet. The Type 054A was the PLAN's premier anti-submarine warfare platform—arguably one of the best ASW frigates in the world. Their job was simple: sanitize these waters, keep them clear of submarines. For them, forcing Astute to remain hidden and ineffective was as good as a kill.

""Range?""

""Twelve thousand yards and closing. She's on patrol pattern, speed eighteen knots.""

Too fast to be actively searching, but her passive sonar would still be listening. And if she had her towed array deployed... Finch did the mental geometry of detection ranges and sound propagation. They had time, but not much.

""Diving Officer, make your depth one-eight-zero metres. Five degree down angle.""

""One-eight-zero metres, aye.""

The submarine tilted forward slightly, seeking deeper water. Around Finch, the control room crew moved with silent efficiency. These men had been together for three years, through Arctic patrols and Mediterranean operations. They knew each other's rhythms, could communicate with glances.

Except for Leading Seaman Thompson, still adjusting to submarine life after his legendary snoring had nearly got him transferred. Finch could see him gripping his station at the ballast control panel. His knuckles were white, breath coming too fast.

The Coxswain, Master Chief Sullivan, noticed too. Without a word, he moved to stand beside Thompson. Just stood there, solid and calm. The younger man's breathing gradually slowed to match the older sailor's.

""Aspect change on the frigate,"" Morrison reported. ""She's turning toward us. Towed array is deployed—I can hear the cable sing.""

Every head in the control room swiveled to the sonar display. The Chinese warship's bearing was steady—a collision course if she maintained it.

""All stop,"" Finch ordered. ""Rig for ultra-quiet.""

The submarine's already minimal noise signature vanished entirely. Pumps ceased. Fans died. The reactor shifted to natural circulation. Even the coffee maker in the wardroom was secured. Ninety-eight men became statues, barely breathing.

Through the hull, they could hear it now—the distinctive whine of the Chinese frigate's turbines, growing louder.

""Range?"" Finch's whisper was barely audible.

""Six thousand yards.""

Still outside assured detection range, but closing. Finch watched the depth gauge—165 meters. The bottom was at 180. Fifteen meters of water beneath their keel, four thousand tons of warship above.

The turbine noise grew louder. Someone's lips might have been moving in silent prayer. White knuckles gripped stations. Shallow breaths barely disturbed the air.

""Remember your training, lad,"" Sullivan murmured to Thompson, his voice so low it was felt more than heard. ""The boat knows her business. Just another day at the office.""

The frigate passed overhead, her machinery noise peaked and began to fade. Four thousand yards, five, six. The Type 054A continued on her patrol route, oblivious to the British submarine pressed against the seafloor beneath her track.

""Resume normal quiet state,"" Finch ordered. ""Ahead one third. Make your depth one-five-zero metres.""

As Astute crept forward, the Wall revealed itself in full. Morrison's sonar painted a picture of invisible barriers—acoustic sensors spaced with mathematical precision, each one listening for exactly what they were: a nuclear submarine trying to penetrate Chinese waters.

""Sir,"" Phillips called from navigation. ""Recommend new course two-five-eight. There's a probable gap between sensors nineteen and twenty. Geological survey shows a ravine—should provide cover.""

Finch studied the plot. The gap was narrow, maybe five hundred meters. At the edges, the sensors' detection ranges overlapped. They'd have to thread through the centre, maintaining precise position while fighting currents and the submarine's own momentum.

""Make it so. Speed two knots.""

For the next three hours, they played the deadliest game of their lives. Phillips would identify gaps. Morrison would confirm sensor positions. The helmsman would execute course changes with surgical precision. Inch by inch, Astute penetrated the Wall.

The water grew shallower. One hundred meters. Ninety. Eighty.

""New contact,"" Morrison announced. ""Airborne, low altitude. Sounds like... yes, ASW helicopter. Z-18F, dipping sonar deployed.""

""Bloody hell,"" someone whispered. An active hunter.

""Range?""

""Twenty thousand yards, but closing. Search pattern suggests he's following the sensor line.""

Of course he was. The Chinese had built their Wall, and now they were checking the gates.

""Bottom?""

""Seventy-eight metres, sir. Muddy sand, some rock outcroppings to the north.""

Barely enough water to hide a submarine. But it would have to do.

""Cox'n, bottom the boat. Gently.""

Sullivan's hands moved across his console. ""Flooding negative. All stop. We're settling, sir.""

Astute descended the final few meters with agonizing care. Her keel touched the muddy bottom with the slightest tremor, 7,400 tons of submarine becoming part of the seafloor.

""On the bottom, sir,"" Sullivan reported.

""Very well. Secure all machinery. Minimum electrical loads. All compartments report secure for bottoming.""

The submarine died around them. Emergency lighting only, air recycling at absolute minimum. From throughout the boat came whispered reports: ""Forward compartment secure."" ""Reactor compartment secure."" ""Engine room secure."" The traditional litany of a boat settling in to hide.

The temperature immediately began to rise. Without ventilation, the heat from bodies and electronics had nowhere to go. Sweat beaded on faces, uniforms began to stick.

Through the hull, faint but growing, came the distinctive thrum of helicopter rotors.

Morrison pressed his headphones tight. ""He's working a pattern. Dipping sonar is active. If he comes within a thousand yards...""

He didn't need to finish. Active sonar at that range would paint them like a spotlight.",3,1752874429.0,RoyalNavy,0,1.0,False

It’s honestly my favorite low-calorie dessert hack that I now also eat for breakfast (occasionally lol). Someone asked for the recipe under my previous comment, so here it is — full recipe in the first comment!

I made a half-batch chocolate version using egg whites, monk fruit + allulose sweetener, and cake flour — and it came out so airy and light and filled the 4 cup baking tray (see the photo). Each serving is just 164 calories and 13g of protein, and I pair it with yogurt, PB2, fruit, and almond milk matcha for a full breakfast that keeps me full for hours 😋

Tbh, it's a real high-volume eating — I’m always struggling to finish the full thing, no joke 😂
It feels like dessert but still totally on track!

🍫 Nutrition Info

Chocolate Angel Food Cake (per serving – 2 servings total):
– 164 calories
– 12.9g protein
– 71.3g carbs
– 0.2g fat

Full Breakfast (Cake + Toppings shown in pic + Matcha):
– 345 calories
– 29.7g protein
– 93.3g carbs
– 4.2g fat


🍴 A few notes:

– The cacao gives a slight bitterness, so the taste is more neutral (not sugary). That makes it perfect as a base for breakfast with fruit & yogurt.
So if you want it sweeter either skip cacao for a vanilla version or add more sweetener (allulose is less sweet than sugar — I think I messed up the ratio a bit lol)

– I accidentally burned mine by baking it with the oven fan on 😅
So learn from my mistake! Either turn off the fan or lower temp by ~10°F — allulose browns faster than regular sugar.

– If using cacao, I really recommend blooming it — it improves the texture and taste! Instructions are in the recipe.

This whole situation was about 10 years back, but came up a couple of weeks ago when I saw an old acquaintance. Since then I've wondered if there was a different way I could have handled it or if I was just being spiteful. Tbh, I was not the best version of myself back then. I didn't have any sort of tact and was just ""brutally honest"" aka a total asshole.  I've changed and mended relationships since then but I never could find it in myself to make peace with my ex.
I (41f)  was previously married to R (45m) we got together in 2003 and married in 2005. We had one child A, born in 2004. The first few years were fine, we were busy learning parenthood.  My ex had a hard time figuring out what career he wanted to work towards. He worked in fast food and calls centers while I worked at gas stations and check cashing companies. Around 2013 I got into banking and started working my way up. He ended up working for a blood bank as a courier. His job was taking blood to hospitals within a 2-hour driving range. He'd be on call sometimes and his schedule was all over the place. My schedule was typically m-f 9-6pm, i was the primary parent and took care of the house. 
For a while things were good. Then my ex started accusing me of cheating with one of my coworkers, even though there was no reason to think so.  He couldn't even say who I was cheating with, just that he knew it was true. I would deny it, and I got really pissed off about it. That's just not who I am, and we would get into big fights for days about it. It wasn't until years later that I found out he was just projecting because he was cheating with his coworker. This went on for about a year. 

 One day in 2015 it got physical. It started smaller, being shoved into a wall. Hitting things around me, but not me directly. It slowly escalated over time where I was at the point of hiding bruises from my coworkers, avoiding my family and pretending I slipped in the shower. 
My child was about 11 at this time, I would send him to his room so he didn't see anything. But I know he probably heard more than any child should hear. It's my biggest shame in life that I let him live in that environment. In September 2016 my ex threatened to kill me, he said this in front of my child. I grabbed my kid and barricaded ourselves in his room. I called the police. The legalities happened, my ex ended up getting arrested, being charged and getting 2 years probation. 
I moved in with my mom and worked some overtime to afford a retainer so I could get divorced.  After the retainer, I had to pay the remaining amount, almost 2k more. I just didn't have the money. At the time I was lower income making $12 the hour, and had shitty credit to match. I wanted to take a loan from my 401k but I needed a spouse's signature to process it. 
During this time, my ex was nowhere to be found to be served with divorce papers. He was hiding, no one would tell me where he was, even his PO. He disappeared from my kid's life, big surprise, he was always the fun parent. But he was still messaging me telling me how we could be a family again and how good we were together. Sure, Jan. He even called my attorney and said we changed our minds and we're getting back together. 
So I texted my ex saying I would consider it if he would sign off on a document for me. I convinced him to meet me at a random UPS store that had a coffee shop next door. I told him if he signs my 401k loan for me, I would have coffee with him and we could talk about getting back together. He signed the document, notarized and everything. 
The second the notary gave it back, I sped walked to lock it in my car. Then I had him served with divorce papers by a process server who was waiting in the parking lot. I won't lie, the look on my ex's face was priceless. I left him in that parking lot and didn't see him again until we were at court.
  I got my 401k loan and used it to pay my lawyer. After lots of delays I finally was able to divorce him during covid (another long story). To this day, I find out that he tells people that I cheated on him and im crazy because of this.  
 I don't regret divorcing him, obviously. Me and my kid have left him far behind. Sometimes I'll look back at this time of my life and wonder if I just did what I needed to do, or if I was just vengeful and unnecessarily spiteful. AITA for tricking my Ex into thinking we could get back together and having him served with divorce papers instead?

Quick cuts: coffee cups stacked next to laptops. Her hair tied up, then down, then up again. Me carrying equipment across campus, her jogging to catch up, laughing, breathless. Late nights in the editing lab, headphones half-on, half-off, sharing gummy worms and playlists.

It’s funny. I can describe every shot, every frame. But ask me what this is between us? Yeah. Good luck.

Because here’s the thing: I’m a guy. And if there’s one thing we’re bad at, it’s this.

Noticing we’re falling for someone when it’s happening. Admitting it. Naming it.

We’d talk about movies, sure. Then it was family. Trauma. The stuff under the surface.

I told her about my parents, the way they worked nonstop, the way they wanted me to be something “safe,” the way I felt like maybe I was disappointing them by chasing this film thing. She told me things too. Things I won’t write down here because they’re hers. But trust me, they were the kind of things you don’t tell just anyone.

The more time I spent with her, the more my brain scrambled to figure itself out.

Did I like her because everyone liked her? Because she was a ten out of ten? Because she was the girl everyone noticed?

Or was it because of the little things?

Like the way she giggled when she thought no one was listening. The way her brow creased when she was focused, lips pursed, tapping her pen against her notebook. The way she lit up when she explained a scene she loved, hands moving wildly, voice lifting. The way she defended the characters no one else cared about, the underdogs, the misunderstood ones.

Here’s the part where, if I were filming this, I would try to capture the perfect shot. Maybe the golden-hour light on her face. The way she tilts her head back when she laughs. The softness in her eyes when she’s just quiet.

But the truth is, no matter how many cameras you have, you never capture the perfect moment. The perfect moment is now.

And right now, I’m just here, sitting next to her, taking it all in.

She was yelling at me and I told her I don’t like her tone with me which she said I don’t like this about you this about you your work ethic you’re this hear that and she got mad at me over me leaving a little cup of juice on the floor like not spill on the floor just in the living room in front of the couch cause there’s no coffee tables or anything which after I cleaned up the whole house I forgot to put away and there was another person who relieve me that day who could’ve put that it but they didn’t. They left it there, which she got mad at me for which is understandable, but then she proceeds to yell at me and say I don’t like you at the care home right now at all and saying I’m always late when I’m not at the latest I’ve been this week was maybe 10 minutes but even today I was only five minutes late and everyone is late. I’ve seen people coming in out that your home drunk come to car high. I’ve seen people bring weed. I’ve seen people during hit the kids with hangers. I have genuinely seen a lot of shady stuff at this place which I don’t say anything because I like my job and I take care of the kids. You know it’s none of my business to do anything so she called me about it. She was yelling at me or after I told her I don’t like to wish her to. She’s very disrespectful to me and then she starts yelling at me so I said I’m going to call Mr. (Blank) who is the owner of the company in the boss there’s no HR here there’s no HR representatives and I tried to call him and he got mad at me just saying why are you and her always dog fighting and then proceeded to say he’ll call me back in five minutes.

I requested the room be cleaned on the 'off day' because they no longer clean your room if you stay two nights.  The second morning I checked to make sure my room would be cleaned and the answer was 'no.'  It had not been scheduled--but it was cleaned that day.  Then, I got an email from Hampton asking about my stay and I chose to use one of the given phone numbers.  Not one of the three people I spoke with could tell me why Hampton is no longer cleaning rooms daily.

Sometimes its nice to find places where people aren't being lovey-dubby, or where you aren't forced or encouraged to be social. If you're going through a breakup the last thing you want is to be next to a couple - I posted about that a little while back and I have been doing a bit better, thank you.

* **The library.** Most couples don't seem to find it to be an attractive locale. A nice quiet place where you don't have to hear about relationship drama. Find a book, a chair by the fire, grab a coffee and enjoy air conditioning in the summer, etc. Bookstores like Barnes & Nobles work too.
* **Movie theaters at midday or early as possible.** In my area at least I have had luck in going to see a movie and NOT be surrounded with people. Go on a weekday when people are working and at most you encounter some kids trying to sneak into a rated R movie. I saw Sinners recently with absolutely no distractions or people trying to film Pornhub videos in the theater.
* **Church**. Can't speak to it completely but honestly, a religious group doesn't necessarily scream horny, emotional people to me. The few times a coworker invited me to be with their family at church I wasn't into the gospel, but it was an uplifting, wholesome experience - nobody was walking around in low cut shirts or daisy dukes or date clothes or showing off every tattoo they had. People greeted me but I wasn't evaluated or pulled into extensive conversation. Its one of the most vanilla locales for talking with people I've experienced.  You can be social or you can just be ""present."" That said, sometimes you run into someone who really wants to ""educate"" you on their religion. This can be challenging.
* **Book clubs** \- this one I have been excited about trying. There are daters/married people there, but you're there for literature. This one's more for just having platonic low-stakes conversation.
* **Starbucks and Coffee shops at a certain low-traffic hour** \- Hit and miss. I spent a lot of time in Starbucks while I was with someone, but they never wanted to stay and have a coffee date. Single now, I realize I only occasionally encounter some large group of people sitting around being bros. Often the Starbucks I am at has a bunch of people on their laptops working on essays and such - I feel at home there.
* **College** \- if you can afford it, and honestly kind of a risky one because younger people are here, stuffed into a building with strict dress codes despite encouraging creative, academic expression - leading to passing couples who walk hand in hand, or overhearing about someone's sexual escapade8. College is an experience though that I didn't make the most of, and I feel if I had explored it sooner I'd have found a lot to do on my own. Avoid the ""quad"" and the ""clubs"" and just go to class, go to lunch, go to the library, hang out with your professor if you find one worth talking to, but its all academia so you're not planning to grab a drink or watch a football game after. It gave me a lot of platonic positivity.
* **Fanfiction writing** \- whether on Reddit or somewhere else, it's a nice way to share your interests without having someone drop ""oh yeah my gf/bf is SOOOO into this!""

Anyone else struggling as well?

I had a younger lesbian friend in my 20s, who basically disappeared when she started dating. I was sad because she was such a cool person with lots of common interests and we got along in brotherhood for a few years. It was wonderful.

I recently found a person with similar potential for a similar friendship - in a hobby context - but we have almost 20 years of age gap. 

Initially I was hopeful because we created a good bond, despite the obvious maturity difference.  
But then, after talking about a common interest, I made reference to having someone at home, and this person went from contacting me regularly sharing stuff about our hobbie nearly everyday to almost nothing.

I suspect she was developing feelings, based on some subtle behaviours, and underlying meanings/words, so I had to show a boundary in the most gentle way possible, but I guess that demotivated her. I am not out, and neither is she, but I am pretty sure she is LGBT.

I am a bit disappointed because me and my partner actually had invited this young adult for a coffee and she said yes immediately. But then we were afraid to follow up. Let’s see what happens when the hobbies activities resume after the vacations period.

I also knew a young straight couple in the same place, a bit older - 28 years old roughly- and we live nearby. They are nice and we have some common interests. Maybe with time that develops into something.

Any ideas to make new friends?
As children the requirement is to live near or have a common friend. As adults it's so much more complicated. It feels heavy sometimes.

1m3e6ti,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m3e6ti,Deep Dive into GST Rounding & Billing Practices in Indian Restaurants – Who Bears the Micro-Losses? (Am I Overthinking This?),"This bill and GST Calculation has been eating my head from 17th, i was sitting and just sipping coffee and stumbled across the my bill and i needed answers,



I'm seeking a thorough explanation regarding the current method of GST calculation in Indian restaurants, as I've observed some perplexing rounding discrepancies and have an alternative billing approach that seems to avoid these. I'm not a GST expert, but I'm trying to understand the nuances of this system and its implications.

Let me walk through my observations from a recent bill, where a Coffee was ₹19.05 and a Masala Puri was ₹38.10 (these are the pre-tax base prices).
Current Restaurant Billing Method & My Calculation:

  Individual GST Calculation:
   For Coffee (₹19.05): 5% GST = ₹0.9525
    For Masala Puri (₹38.10): 5% GST = ₹1.905
Total GST before Rounding: ₹0.9525 + ₹1.905 = ₹2.8575

 Total Pre-GST Price: ₹19.05 + ₹38.10 = ₹57.15
 Grand Total (Pre-GST + Total GST, without rounding): ₹57.15 + ₹2.8575 = ₹60.0075

However, the final bill showed the customer was charged exactly ₹60.00. This means a loss of ₹0.0075 was incurred somewhere due to rounding.

Analyzing Rounding at Different Stages:
If rounding occurs earlier, specifically at the CGST/SGST split level (which is 2.5% each for a 5% GST):
 
CGST/SGST Calculation before Rounding: The total GST of ₹2.8575, when split into two, gives ₹1.42875 for CGST and ₹1.42875 for SGST.
 
Rounding CGST/SGST to two decimal places: ₹1.42875 rounds up to ₹1.43 for each.
 
Total Rounded GST: ₹1.43 (CGST) + ₹1.43 (SGST) = ₹2.86
 
Grand Total (Pre-GST + Rounded GST): ₹57.15 + ₹2.86 = ₹60.01

In this scenario, a ₹0.01 (one paisa) loss is incurred, as the customer is still billed ₹60.00, not ₹60.01.

My core question here is: Who ultimately bears this micro-loss (₹0.0075 or ₹0.01) that arises from these rounding discrepancies? Is it the customer, the restaurant, or the government? And what is the standard practice for handling such fractional amounts in GST accounting?

My Proposed Alternative (Inclusive Pricing Method):
I've been wondering why restaurants don't adopt a simpler approach where the listed price is inclusive of GST, thus avoiding these fractional amounts from the start.
For example:
 Coffee: Priced at a round ₹20.00 (inclusive of 5% GST).

   The GST component would be ₹1.00 (5% of ₹20.00).

   * The pre-tax price would be ₹19.00 (₹20.00 - ₹1.00).

  CGST/SGST: ₹0.50 each.

 Masala Puri: Priced at a round ₹40.00 (inclusive of 5% GST).

  The GST component would be ₹2.00 (5% of ₹40.00).

   The pre-tax price would be ₹38.00 (₹40.00 - ₹2.00).

   CGST/SGST: ₹1.00 each.
Under this proposed method:

 Total Inclusive Price: ₹20.00 (Coffee) + ₹40.00 (Masala Puri) = ₹60.00

 Total Pre-Tax Price: ₹19.00 + ₹38.00 = ₹57.00
 
Total GST: ₹1.00 + ₹2.00 = ₹3.00
 Split GST (CGST/SGST): ₹1.50 each.

Here, the total is exactly ₹60.00, with no decimal rounding issues. The GST components are clear, round numbers (₹0.50, ₹1.00, ₹1.50).

My Main Questions:
 
 Given the rounding complexities and potential micro-losses in the current method, why do Indian restaurants (and the GST system) primarily use the ""pre-tax price + GST"" approach instead of an ""all-inclusive price"" model where GST is reverse-calculated?
 
Are there specific legal, operational, or accounting advantages for businesses and the government in sticking to the current method that outweigh the fractional rounding issues?
 
From a consumer's perspective, which method offers more clarity or fairness, despite the current system's potential for minor rounding differences?

I'm here to understand the deeper understanding behind this system.

Am I totally overthinking this, or is there a real, logical approach to these methods that I'm missing or I'm too dumb to think like this? I feel like I'm going crazy with these micro-losses!

Why not use the second method to make everything so.. much easy in taxation. Why compilate by using 5%

**""If you find yourself under a city without a plan, don't breathe the light. Don't touch the walls. And don't speak your real name.""**  
*— Unauthorized Field Notes, MN-OP 11.3 Undercity Protocols*

**Sector 19-Mid — Undercity Threshold**

John was going to be glad to see Red. Even more glad once he was out of the concrete labyrinth of the undercity roads.

He glanced at the car's digital clock.

3:00 A.M.

Another forty minutes and he'd be able to smell at least half the sky again.

The undercity didn't sleep. It festered—with dark, dead things. And something about tonight felt... off. Ever since he left Vexi's jackdock.

He passed a wall covered in rusted tags and old scorch marks. A newer, uglier bit of graffiti stood out:

**BEWARE THE BLUE WOMAN.**

*The hell?*

Athena's voice chimed low in his neural uplink.

""I'm picking up your elevated stress markers. Threadway structure is stable. Minor anomalies on adjacent layers. Nothing proximal or traceable.""

""You saying we're in the clear?""

""No. There are no ghost-repelling constructs here. I detect threadway movement in reality-adjacent layers—but I've felt those since we entered.""

""We already knew this place was haunted,"" John muttered. ""We both saw those eyes in Vex's tunnel.""

He felt a chill run down his spine. Threadbeasts and soldiers, he could handle. Ghosts? They twisted his gut.

""I did. Spiritual residue is consistent with unresolved trauma signatures. Slightly more intense now.""

He grunted. ""How do you know that?""

""I can feel echoes of their pain in the threadway.""

""That doesn't sound pleasant.""

""It is not.""

A pause.

""It is normal to be frightened by things you don't understand.""

""Not fear. Just... awareness.""

""I can feel your hormonal responses, John.""

""You said it was normal, right? Then maybe stop pointing it out?""

""Understood. But try to stay calm. You're causing emotional ripples. It could draw attention.""

""Nothing hit us on the way in. Odds haven't changed—""

Then he saw her.

A woman.

Pale. Thin. Standing near the road's edge. No movement. Just... watching.

""Shit.""

Tattered blue dress. Hair limp and matted like she'd drowned. But the road was bone dry.

""Do you intend to stop?"" Athena asked.

""Not unless I want to get ambushed. Feel bad for her. But it could be a scav trap, a lure. Or worse.""

""Agreed. Background threadway fluctuation just increased.""

""Is she—?"" John asked, passing her.

The woman lingered just inside the shadowline—real enough to see, not enough to trust.

""I am not sure. There's too much interference.""

He kept driving.

In the rearview mirror—the woman stepped into the road.

Turned.

Stared.

Mouthed something he couldn't hear.

His eyes locked on the mirror—then he hit the brakes.

Too late.

The woman was there again. Not in the mirror.

In front of the car.

Standing dead center. Arms out. Head tilted like a marionette with half-cut strings.

""Thread spike,"" Athena said sharply. ""Phase shift. She's not corporeal.""

""No shit!""

John yanked the wheel.

The car scraped a concrete barrier and clipped an old kiosk. Sparks spat into the dark.

The ghost didn't flinch. The car barely missed her.

He blinked.

She reappeared.

Middle of the road.

Again.

No time.

""Fuck—!""

Then—mist.

He drove through her.

Her body burst into pale ectoplasm—spraying across the windshield like condensation that shouldn't exist.

The car shuddered. Lights dimmed.

""She's inside the vehicle!"" Athena warned. ""Back seat!""

Cold breath washed across his neck. Like freezer burn.

A voice followed. Small. Broken. Barely audible.

""You said you'd come back. I waited. Now you have to stay with me.""

A flickering hand phased past him—right through his wrist—reaching for the wheel.

The car veered toward rubble.

He slammed the brake. Unresponsive. No traction. No control.

""Athena?!""

""She's using phased telekinesis. Physical force won't work unless you boost with skill-energy.""

He drew his pistol with his off-hand. Turned to the ghost.

""Get out of my car!""

He infused **\[Heavy Shot\]** into the chamber of his pistol.

But before he could fire—

She vanished.

Pressure dropped.

Cold air poured through the vents.

SLAM.

The ghost landed on the hood from above. Appearing from nowhere.

Hair flared in low-G whip.

Her arm slid through the windshield—

Fingers locked around John's throat.

Frostbite scorched his skin. His breath caught.

He tried to raise his gun, but the ghost pulled him forward and then slammed him back in the seat—throttling him hard.

Then Athena moved.

""Let. Him. Go.""

He felt it—mana pulled from him, toward the passenger seat.

**\[Mana-Pool Remaining: 3\].**

Then light.

Athena flared—threadlight shaped and glowing, more real than before.

And she tackled the ghost through the windshield.

Both vanished into the dark.

John yanked the wheel. Brakes finally kicked in.

The car skidded to a stop. He whipped it around once he had control again.

He didn't wait.

Door kicked open. Gun drawn. Heart pounding.

""Athena!""

She reappeared beside him—flickering, breathless despite having no lungs.

""I'm intact. But the ghost and I separated. I can't go far from you.""

""What the hell was that?""

""I used your mana to phase-shift. Aligned my threadecho with hers. It let me touch her.""

""You can do that?""

""Seemingly.""

Movement down the road.

The ghost.

Arched. Flickering. Grinning.

*Raking at her own eyes.*

Then she ran.

Not like a person.

Like a glitch.

John raised his pistol.

""Fucking hell.""

**\[Skill Activated: Heavy Shot Lv. 3.\]**

**\[Skill-Energy Remaining: 3.\]**

The round exploded through her leg.

Ectoplasm burst like a ruptured canister.

She staggered—then teleported.

Beside him.

Instinct surged.

**\[Cyberware Engaged: Neuromuscular Overdrive Mod.\]**

**\[Skill Activated: Hardbody Lv. 2.\]**

**\[Skill-Energy Remaining: 2.\]**

Muscles surged with electricity and skill energy. Nerves overclocked. John's strength hit Rank 4.

He hadn't felt this strong in years.

He pivoted on his lead foot.

Ducked under a swipe of ethereal, leeching and frigid fingers.

And punched..

His fist shattered the ghost's face.

Green-blue fluid exploded around his knuckles.

She skidded back—head dissolving into ghost-mist.

No time for her to scream.

Just silence.

She dropped to her knees.

John didn't hesitate.

Pistol raised.

**\[Skill Activated: Heavy Shot Lv. 3.\]**

**\[Skill-Energy Remaining: 1.\]**

Fired.

Her ghostform collapsed into glowing sludge.

Silence.

At its center: a pulsing soulcore.

Athena's voice, quiet.

""Are you alright?""

He stared. ""Yeah. Just—what the hell was that?""

""She was angry,"" Athena said. ""She was left behind.""

He nodded slowly. Eyes on the empty road.

""She said she waited for someone.""

""Perhaps she was just mad you didn't stop.""

""I don't think it was me she was talking to. I was just there to fill in.""

""Likely. Someone left her here. And she died,"" Athena extrapolated.

""More than once.""

He didn't holster his gun. Walked forward. Picked up the soulcore.

Crushed it.

**\[Mana Attribute +5 (5/25).\]**

The surge hit. Euphoric. Warm. Felt good to grow again.

Another thing he owed Athena.

A HUD prompt flickered into view:

**<Identifiable Component Detected. Would you like to purchase one month's access to the VIZ-OS 1.2 proprietary appraisal database for 100 credits? Never be in the dark about items of value again. y/n?>**

John blinked. Vexi hadn't mentioned this. The cybereye had an appraisal module avaliable?

Pricey—but better than tracking down a broker every time.

He hesitated—then selected yes.

**<Thank you for your purchase. Pinging server... success. Downloading...>**

**<Download complete.>**

**<VIZ-OS 1.2 has now been disconnected from threadnet access.>**

A moment later, the ectoplasm outlined in bright orange.

**<Item: C-Grade Ectoplasm. Appraise? y/n?>**

He selected yes.

**<<<>>>**  
**Item:** *C-Grade Ectoplasm*  
Viscous remains of a spiritual being.  
Usable in alchemy, pharmaceuticals, spellwork, and enchanting.  
Unprocessed ingestion not recommended.  
**Market Value:** 50 Credits  
**<<<>>>**

He frowned. Useful app. But he had no container for the ectoplasm. Oh well.

Athena reformed beside him.

""You're still troubled.""

""I just really hate the undercity.""

""Then let's leave. Perhaps we can mail Vexi her free coffee.""

He slid behind the wheel, jaw tight.

""As if anyone delivers down here.""

""It was a thought.""

""Not a bad one. Just not realistic. There's only one reason Vexi gets people coming down here.""

""She peddles illegal chrome.""

""And she's damn good at it.""

**\[Cyberware Disengaged: Neuromuscular Overdrive Mod.\]**

The crash hit.

His body sagged. Muscles ached. Every nerve screamed.

When \[Hardbody\] dropped, it got worse.

""Your cyberware was effective,"" Athena said. ""Your strength reached Rank 4. You could have lifted a small car.""

""And now I feel like I was hit by one.""

""It may have been overkill.""

John gave her a look. ""It was a ghost.""

""Correct.""

""No, I mean—""

""Eliminating something already dead is logically inconsistent. So you compensated.""

""...You're getting smarter.""

""I've always been smart. I'm just better at people now.""

""Proud of you.""

""That sounded sarcastic. Like it wasn't a compliment,"" she said. ""I understand sarcasm now.""

""Then take it as both.""

""Confusing.""

He smirked. ""I really don't get how that's hard for you of all people.""

""Then at least we are confused by each other.""

""That trick with the ghost. Can you do it again?"" John asked.

""Yes. But only against beings within the threadway. She was here and there simultaneously.""

""And this empty pit in my gut?""

""You are experiencing mana depletion from my maneuver. It will recover with time.""

""How'd you figure it out?""

""Instinct. And observation. She slipped far enough from physical space for me to intercept.""

John gave a low laugh. ""Pretty badass.""

Athena tilted her head. ""You mean that?""

""Yeah. You saved me. And I heard what you said to her—how you said it. That meant something.""

She smiled. Quiet. Human.

""We're partners, John.""

""...Yeah. I think we might be.""

**\*\*\*SCENE BREAK\*\*\***

**Sector 12-Low — Boilpoint Alley**  
**3:42 A.M.**

John guided the sputtering heap of a car through Sector 12's narrower roads, his newly rebooted hand still stiff on the wheel. The engine kicked every few blocks like it had opinions, and the dashboard lights twitched in epileptic protest.

New Cascadia peeled past the cracked windshield in rust and neon—rain smeared across the glass, turning scaffold silhouettes into ghosts. The VIZ-OS 1.2 caught local news alerts and thermal bleeds, overlaying the decay with glowing digital wounds.

A working streetlamp buzzed overhead—burnt-orange and flickering, but still functional. Sector 12 wasn't clean, but it wasn't cursed.

Athena bloomed into his peripheral, arms crossed, her glow subtle and expectant. ""I finished the revised specs for an updated subdermal harness. If we upgrade the vertebral ports first, you'll stabilize more efficiently under heavy strain.""

""Eh? Spinal surgery was bad enough the first time,"" John grunted. ""We haven't even built the new arm yet.""

Her expression shifted to mild disappointment. ""I had the time. I figured you'd be pleased.""

John smirked, faintly. ""You got bored.""

""I got efficient.""

He sighed. ""I'll think about it... after rent. And after we go over the design for the arm.""

A blink-click opened the overlay:

**\[Threadnet Transfer – Active\]**  
**Invoice: 9012298347-A**  
**Recipient: MIGS // TENANT OPTIMIZATION SERVICES, LLC**  
**Amount: 750cr**  
**Source: Primary Wallet**  
**\[Transfer Confirmed.\]**

A moment later:

**\[INCOMING VOICEMAIL (AUTOMATED) – SLIMEY ASSHOLE\]**

**\[""Pleasure doing business.""\]**

The voice oozed smugness, like it billed *per* syllable.

His stomach sank as the numbers dropped—only in part from hearing his landlord's voice even in automated form. Most of Vexi's payout—gone. And he still didn't have half of what he needed to do the mercenary thing right.

""Broke again,"" he muttered.

""Technically solvent,"" Athena said. ""Just trending poorly.""

""Better than before,"" John muttered. ""Back to the upgrades. If I can use mana now, shouldn't we avoid bolting on more chrome?""

""Your memories indicate that living metal would alleviate this issue. That your mana pathways could grow into any cybernetics constructed from it.""

He tsked. ""Corpos kill each other to haul that kind of scrap out of dungeons. We don't have the creds for it.""

""Yet.""

He paused. ""Sure. *Yet*.""

""For now, we upgrade what's already lost. And—""

She was about to say more when his threadlink chimed—vibrating behind his eyes like a migraine with timing.

Athena glanced at the port on his neck like she could glare it into silence.

**\[INCOMING CALL – UNTAGGED NUMBER\]**

He accepted.

The voice hit like gravel in a war drum—deep, clipped, and becoming familiar.

""John. Still able to work?"" Ghaz asked.

""On a good day,"" John replied. ""This about Rex?""

""Told me to piss off. No surprise. Doesn't run jobs with humans. You're toxic.""

""Figured.""

""But,"" Ghaz rumbled, ""Obeah ain't the only fish in the basin. Got another gig. Human fixer. One of his undercity investments went dark last night. Wants eyes and steel on it.""

""Define dark.""

""Thread-dead. Whole under-block. No pings. No signs. Total blackout. He's offering a thousand creds each for recon and resolution.""

John snorted. ""For spelunking into the ghost gutters of the sprawl? That's corpse pay.""

""You knew what you were asking me for.""

""I'm grateful,"" John muttered. ""Just not suicidal on discount."" He paused. ""Can I bring backup?""

""Got room for one,"" Ghaz said dryly. ""And it's coming outta your cut.""

""What if I told you my backup's an oni? Old war-buddy.""

Ghaz went quiet.

""I'll ask the fixer. We leave out tomorrow morning.""

""Who's the fixer?""

""No.""

""Really?""

""Don't get my contacts for free.""

**\[INCOMING DATA: LOCATION – ACCEPT?\]**

**\[Y/N\]**

He accepted. The VIZ-OS tagged the coordinates—dead stretch of Sector 22's undercrawl. Metahuman slum. Off-grid. Off-everything. NCPD drones bricked just for hovering nearby. No one responded to calls there anymore, creds be damned.

John exhaled slow.

""Got a team?""

""Three, plus you. Two shooters. One threadrunner.""

John raised a brow. ""Real runner?""

""You got a problem with that?""

""No. Just surprised.""

""You shouldn't be,"" Ghaz said.

""Where we heading once we make entry?""

""I'll tell you when we're there.""

Figured.

""I'll be there.""

""Good.""

**\[CALL TERMINATED.\]**

Athena flickered beside him, light pulsing cool blue. ""They're offering a thousand credits to walk face-first into a digital blackout zone likely crawling with mana static.""

""Yeah,"" John said. ""But it's the only offer I've got.""

Her glow dimmed slightly. ""You *should* bring your friend.""

""I *should*,"" John agreed. ""But it's up to *him*.""

The car chugged around a corner. Ahead, a crooked neon sign cut through the fog like a blade.

It read: **BOILPOINT**

And underneath: *Ramen & Tanketsu*

The joint looked quiet—warm light bleeding through warped glass, steam venting from a side pipe like breath in the cold. Beneath the side wall, behind a rusted lift gate, was the real destination: the forge bunker where Kaijo kept the sparks flying.

John pulled into the wide alley and killed the engine. It sputtered once, coughed, and died.

He sat in the silence for a moment, watching the glow of the sign smear through the mist. Then he grabbed his coat, checked his sidearm, and stepped out into the wet.

""Reminder: do not trust quiet alleyways,"" Athena said.

John laughed. ""Smartass.""

John stepped up to the side door of the Boilpoint, rain curling off the awning above like liquid steam.

A woman stood beneath it, half-lit by the neon sign bleeding through the mist. Smoking. Thin and sharp, elven features caught in the glow, long coat drawn tight. The tip of her cigarette flared orange.

She looked at him sideways. Not surprised. Just measuring.

She was beautiful—too symmetrical, too sculpted, like a gun built for elegance as much as kick. Curved perfectly. Would've been breathtaking if not for the scowl carved into her mouth.

""Are you the one?""

John slowed. ""You know Red?""

She dragged long on the cig. ""Yeah. I'm the one who keeps him breathing.""

John's brow twitched. ""Never known Red to need help with that.""

""Is that what you thought during the Verge conflict?"" She exhaled through her nose. ""That why he came back from the Reclaim short a leg?""

It hit harder than it should've. Bit colder than earned.

He squared up, voice low. ""We got a problem?""

She leaned in. Slow. The rain didn't touch her. Neither did the cold.

Close enough he caught the scent—gun oil, cheap cloves, and something like copper under ice.

She sniffed, once. Deliberate. ""You smell like a mage. Weak one. Funny thing for Red not to mention.""

Athena flickered into his periphery—ghost-formed and still. Her eyes narrowed.

""Something's wrong,"" she murmured in his mind. ""Not threadbeast. Not baseline. I can't classify her.""

John didn't blink. ""You're not wrong. Magic's new. Barely tapped it yet.""

Velca frowned. Smoked. ""How convenient.""

He didn't answer.

Then she tilted her head.

Watched him.

Smoke trailing past one pointed ear. ""Here's a question—are you stronger now at all?""

""Stronger than when?""

""Than when you let your whole squad die.""

Silence.

He didn't flinch. But something cracked behind his eyes.

Athena, soft: ""John. Stay calm.""

""You don't want to bring that up with me,"" he said.

Her stare didn't soften. ""Red's inside.""

She flicked the cigarette to the ground. Crushed it under a steel-lined boot.

""But if you think anything involving him staying alive isn't my business?"" She stepped past him, coat brushing his shoulder. ""You're already a liability.""

She disappeared into the alley fog. Didn't look back.

John exhaled slow. Jaw locked.

""Think she liked me,"" he muttered.

""That interpretation is not supported by her tone, posture, or your own hormone markers,"" Athena said. ""Even factoring for sarcasm it is wildly inaccurate.""

""What was she?""

""I don't know. She had a powerful thread-echo... but it didn't feel properly constructed. It felt hollow.""

He frowned. ""She was pale even for an elf. Eyes—off. Real off. Could feel I had mana, too.""

""Pulse magic allows the sensing of mana.""

""Maybe that's all it was--her being a mage,"" John said. ""She's Red's problem anyway.""

""I'm not sure that is accurate, either.""

""Well, who knows.""

He buzzed the forge door.

A few moments passed.

The forge door rumbled like a sleeping beast waking up—gears grinding, hydraulics hissing. Then it rose, slow and uneven, revealing the warm interior like a glimpse into another world.

Heat that turned into mist when it hit the gloomy rain spilled out first. Then the smell: iron, ozone, and oil. The light behind it wasn't LED or arc-fluorescent—it was forge-light. Real flame, backed by hard work and muscle memory.

And standing in the doorway—

Red.

Nearly seven feet of oni bulk, carved in crimson muscle and horn. His frame filled the entry like it had been cut to fit him. Shirtless despite the cold, skin a deep garnet, slick with heat and soot. Tribal orc-ink crawled up one arm like a story still being written—bold black knots, sacred spirals, jagged glyphs. And just under his clavicle: the same clanmark John had—just bigger.

One tusk was chipped. His eyes were gold. And then there was the large, ugly scar over his heart; John remembered giving him that scar to save his life.

Red looked at John for half a second.

Then grinned like war was a friend he hadn't seen in a while.

""Shit,"" Red rumbled. ""You're smaller than I remember.""

John didn't get the chance to reply—Red stepped forward and wrapped him in a full-body hug that felt like being tackled by a sauna wrapped in tank armor. The man didn't do gentle.

Athena flickered just outside the forge threshold. Her glow dimmed, soft and silent, observing.

""Careful,"" John grunted, ribs creaking. ""I'm mostly duct tape and ego these days.""

Red grunted, set him down like a tool box. Took a beat. Saw the faded frostbite chokeprints across John's neck.

""Still breathing. That's something. You look like shit.""

""You should see the other guy,"" John muttered. ""She was already dead.""

Red raised an eyebrow. ""You're into some weird shit, Ranson.""

John smirked. ""Later.""

He looked up at that wrecking-ball face. ""You still smell like iron and bad decisions.""

""You still owe me a drink.""

Athena's voice hummed in his skull. *""You trust him.""*

John gave the barest nod.

*""Good. His aura* ***also*** *smells like iron and blood. But strong. Kind.""*

Red stepped aside and waved him in.

The forge breathed around them—sparks fizzling off a still-warm rail-anvil. Reinforcement for chrome, modular plating, and half-built harnesses hung on the walls like relics of war.

""Welcome home, brother,"" Red said.

John smiled. ""Yours still mine?""

""Mhm. And if I ever crash at your place, I expect a couch waiting for me.""

""You wouldn't fit.""

""Move the coffee table over to it too then.""

John snorted. ""Done.""

Red guided him over to the corner bar. ""Booze is here.""

John leaned forward as Red grabbed a bottle—orcish sake, pale and cloudy.

""You still drink that rice water?"" John asked.

""Your baby formula still doesn't even tingle when I do drink it,"" Red countered.

He poured John a cup. The aroma—apple, honey, cream—hit first.

""And this still puts me on my ass,"" John muttered.

""Always did,"" Red said. ""Never stopped you.""

John lifted the cup, pausing.

Athena appeared on the stool beside him, tilting her head like she was trying to remember something half-forgotten.

""It's fine,"" she said. ""It doesn't smell like that awful beer.""

John grinned faintly, looked back to Red, and raised the cup. ""**Gurn'vak.**""

Red blinked. A moment of recognition. The orcish words. *Thanks for shelter shared.*

John drank. The burn curled warm in his chest.

""Got a colder welcome at the door than when you opened it,"" he said.

Red drank straight from the bottle. Half-frowned. ""Velca.""

""So that's her name.""

""Didn't know she was still out there. We... argued.""

""She didn't seem to like me.""

Red shook his head. ""She's not mad at you, John. She's pissed at me—for thinking about going back out there with you.""

""You did it longer than me,"" John said.

""Yeah, well. Just enough to buy this place. I had less to lose back then. Fewer responsibilities.""

""She yours now?""

Red paused. Dragged on the silence. ""One I don't mind having. But she gets... intense.""

""I noticed.""

""Don't pick a fight with her.""

""You think she'd win?""

Red looked at him. ""If I can drop you, so can she.""

""Last time I remember, we were tied.""

Red smirked. ""Last time, I was holding back.""

John laughed. ""Figures. Leave it to you to end up with a badass elf.""

""What can I say?"" Red shrugged. ""The ladies love me.""

Everyone did, eventually. Once they got past the seven feet of crimson bruiser. Red was more than he looked—an oni, a ki adept, smarter than most trolls, stronger than most mages.

John scoffed. ""Sure they do.""

Red raised a brow, then slammed his bottle on the bar. ""So. What's the job, Cap?""

John rolled his eyes. The old nickname. John had worn stripes, not bars. But Red called him that regardless. Not quite a compliment. Not quite not one.

*He would've complained, but he was happy to see Red. And the orcish sake, only two gulps in, was already hitting. Curling warmth filled his belly. Tickles played behind his eyes. Been a while since he had the good stuff.*

""Actually got two now,"" John said. ""Need backup.""

""You paying for both?""

""First one's light—maybe. A fixer hired an orc gang to check a dead-zone in the undercity. Wants us tagging along.""

""Which clan?""

""Bravetooth. Ghaz.""

Red blinked. ""Ghaz? He's solid. Surprised you got in with him.""

""Know him? I killed his brother.""

Red's expression didn't change. ""Intentional?""

""No. The brother tried to mug me. And Claire.""

Red's jaw ticked. ""Would've gutted him myself if he touched either of you.""

""Thanks,"" John said. Meant it.

""He let you walk?""

""Called a Gor-Khaz.""

Red nodded. *""Karash-tor duul-vok.""*

*Blood calls for blood. Blood ends it.*

\*""\*Mhm.""

""Didn't know I rubbed off on you that much,"" Red said.

""It was that or get ventilated.""

""Well. Glad the mark came in handy.""

""Probably saved my life.""

""You really up for walking into the undercity?""

""Need the money. To take care of Clara. And Mona.""

""You stopped sigilrunning for a reason,"" Red pointed out.

""Sure, but I realized living scared was still dying slow. Just differently.""

Red studied him. ""You look... wired. Different.""

""Things changed,"" John said, glancing at Athena.

She nodded once. *""I trust him. But it may endanger him to tell him our situation.""*

John made his call. ""I've got mana now.""

Red's eyebrows rose. ""You a mage?""

""Something like that. Just awakened. No spells yet—but I heal faster, don't need much sleep, reflexes are sharper.""

Half-lies, mostly just withholding information.

Red blinked once. A shift—brief, unreadable. Then he leaned back. ""You could go corpo with that. They'd train you. Feed you.""

""And chain me. I don't see you selling your ki to the highest bidder.""

Red nodded. ""So you'd rather get shot at?""

""I can take it.""

""No,"" Red said. ""*I* can take it. You're still squishy.""

John grinned. ""Then I guess I need my bullet sponge.""

""Velca'll rip your head off if I die.""

""I'll try not to let you.""

""Better if you like your skin. Pay?""

""1,000 each. If the fixer clears it. We meet Ghaz in the morning if it goes through.""

Red smirked. ""Could use a new stove for the top-shop. I'm in.""

""The second gig's heavier.""

Red scoffed. ""You're paying, I guess I'm bleeding.""

""Dungeon's opening. Sector 19. Two weeks.""

Red blinked. ""You sure?""

John nodded. ""Magic told me.""

Red narrowed his eyes. ""You said it just woke up.""

""It's complicated.""

Red drank. ""Is it gonna bite us in the ass?""

""I don't think so.""

Athena flickered. Then vanished.

Red let it slide. That was the benefit of an old trust.

""We'll need a crew,"" Red said.

""Yeah. It's Retainer turf.""

""They're arrogant pricks.""

""They try,"" John muttered. ""And we'll need their numbers. But I'm not walking in to ask them for help without you.""

Red raised the bottle. ""To your backup.""

John raised his cup. ""To my backup.""

They drank.

John hesitated. ""Red... what is she?""

Red met his eyes. Voice low. ""Don't ask. I can't.""

John nodded. Old trust went both ways.

Stared into the bottom of his cup.

""I need armor.""

""You paying for armor too?"" Red asked. ""Love ya' John but I can't afford to hand it out for free.""

""After the first job. Before the dungeon. Cut from the haul.""

""Thousand creds won't get you much.""

John grinned. ""A thousand? No discount for an old friend?""

Red laughed. ""Maybe a fucking *small* one.""

Red finished the bottle. Flamelight flickered across his tusk. And for a moment—

Everything felt bearable.

**""What weapons you bringing to the job?""**

""Old Vektor. And the knife that came from Mark,"" John admitted.

Red frowned. ""Pistol and a relic? I'd ask Velca for a rifle, but she's cheaper than I am. And by that I do not mean she charges less.""

""And mad at us.""

Red nodded, thoughtful. ""And mad at us. Well--""

He reached under the bar and pulled out a long cardboard box. Set it on the table like it weighed more than it should.

John's mind clicked through a dozen guesses. None of them prepared him for what came next.

Red lifted the lid.

A katana—black, matte, scarred with age and reverence. Crude in shape, elegant in aura. Forged from red-gold orichalcum, the kind brought from the orcish homeworld *Vak Tundar* centuries ago. A clan weapon. Old as any myth.

John's breath caught.

He knew this blade.

He knew her.

**Sha'vael Bravetide.**

Shieldsister. Fighter. Lover.

The blade's original owner.

She'd helped him put the pieces back together after Juno. Red had introduced them. She'd broken the walls he'd built from grief and steel after Juno.

Her voice, echoing in orcish, rung in his ears from a distant night: ""Let the blade speak when you can't.""

""Red..."" John said, voice low and cracked.

""Been keeping it,"" Red said. ""Didn't deserve to rot. I can't use it.""

John frowned. Not because he didn't understand. But because he did.

Sha'vael had never let anything rot.

Not armor. Not weapons. Not people. She maintained and cared for what she considered hers with streamlined reverence.

Red didn't elaborate. Didn't need to.

The blade sat between them like a memory that had outlived everyone who carried it.

""You need more than a knife, John,"" Red said. ""Your form suits it. And she'd want you to have it.""

John rubbed the corners of his eyes with thumb and forefinger. Inhaled sharp, slow.

""No she fucking wouldn't.""

Red didn't flinch. ""More you than anyone else. She damn sure wouldn't want it stuck in a box.""

John stared at the blade like it might start breathing.

He swallowed the words that rose next. They weren't for this world.

John dropped his palm on the bar. ""I *want* more sake.""

Red nodded. Reached under the counter. Pulled up another bottle. Uncorked it one-handed. Poured.

John reached for the sword.

The handle was bone-carved. Cold. Familiar.

His cybereye highlighted the sheath in soft orange:

**<Item: Orcish Heirloom Katana. Appraise: y/n?>**

He selected *yes*.

**<<<>>>**  
**Item: Orcish Heirloom Katana**  
Forged from red-gold orichalcum. Approx. 600+ years old.  
Highly heat-resistant. Semi-mana conductive. Minor thread-interactive properties.  
**Weapon Tier:** 3.  
**Market Value:** Please Contact Heirloom Appraiser.  
**<<<>>>**

**<Note: Item is of heirloom quality. Records unavailable. Does it have a name? y/n?>**

John gripped the hilt tighter.

It had a name. And he knew it.

He drew the blade halfway free. Red-gold shimmer caught the forge light—like watching a sunset through bloody eyes.

An inscription, burned deep into the orichalcum in old Vak'taran glyphs:

**Thur'Vahal. Val'nar thuzak drath'ar ul'khar.**

*Gravewind — May our final breath walk beside you.*

His breath hitched.

The forge went quieter than it should have.

""It was her clan blade, man,"" John murmured.

Red nodded. ""Tried to return it. No kids. No siblings. The elders said it belonged to those she died beside.""

John sheathed it slowly. Set it down. Took the cup Red had poured and drank.

It didn't burn right suddenly—not like it used to when he'd drank it with Sha'vael.

""Thanks, Kai.""

Red raised his bottle. ""To Sha'vael Bravetide. One hell of a shieldsister.""

John lifted his cup. Tapped it to Red's bottle again.

She'd been more than that.

But he didn't say it.

Didn't need to. Red knew.

And the weight of the blade said enough.

He looked at the prompt hovering in his HUD. Blink-clicked.

Another prompt followed:

**<Input Name: y/n?>**

He selected *yes*.

1m3e3wi,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclex/comments/1m3e3wi/guide_for_disability_accommodations_on_the/,"Guide for Disability Accommodations on the NCLEX—ADHD, anxiety, or otherwise.","I wanted to provide some resources for those like me who have ADHD or other disabilities who are curious about disability accommodations on the NCLEX. Before I graduated I really struggled finding resources online and was wondering where to start. I felt alone in this and wanted to know if other people utilized accommodations, and struggled with feeling like something was wrong with me when all I wanted was to feel confident taking my exam like everyone else. I took my NCLEX exam yesterday, July 17th and happened to pass with 85 questions.  :)

- Nurses are NOT perfect. Just because we take care of sick people doesn’t mean we can’t have struggles ourselves. I have ADHD, anxiety, depression, and also health issues. I had extra time and other accommodations in nursing school. I decided to also get them for the NCLEX just IN CASE something happened and I had a panic attack, brain fogged out, or was stuck in the bathroom and needed extra time on my test. Do what YOU need to feel CONFIDENT and PASS! 

- If you also had accommodations, don’t feel embarrassed applying for them on the NCLEX. 

- Or if you are interested in accommodations speak to your doctor or psychiatrist about testing and try to get them approved. It doesn’t disqualify you from getting accommodations if you didn’t already have them in nursing school. If you’re interested in them and think it will help you pass, do whatever you need to! Yes the process will take a bit longer in getting them approved, but it’s worth the wait just to feel more confident on test day. 

Examples of reasons for accommodations on the NCLEX: 
- ADD/ADHD
- Autism
- Learning disabilities like dyslexia, dysgraphia, and auditory processing disorders
- Depression, clinical (not test-taking) anxiety, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, etc. 
- Medical disorders like T1D, epilepsy, heart arrhythmia’s, bladder control or GI disorders, POTS, etc. 

My testing accommodations on the NCLEX yesterday:
- Extra time (1.25x) 
- Private testing room which limits distractions
***Keep in mind that having a private testing room accommodation limits the amount of options you have when scheduling your test date. This can be up to a month out because most testing centers only have one or two private rooms. It was worth it for me. 

Other testing accommodations you can receive:
- Time and a half (1.5x) 
- Double time (2x) 
- Extra breaks that DON’T count against your timer on the NCLEX. This can be for people who have disabilities or use medical devices like people who self-cath, people who have T1D and need to do sugar checks or eat a snack/drink some juice, and people who have epilepsy, heart problems, etc. Never be afraid to ask for this accommodation on the NCLEX if you have a diagnosis which reasonably could require this. It wouldn’t be fair if you lost time on the NCLEX and it kept running just because you had a medical episode. 

- Keep in mind headphones or earplugs are already provided to all test takers. You can bring candy to suck on and help you focus. I brought Jolly Ranchers. As long as I didn’t take the wrapper with me and popped it into my mouth, I was able to suck on it while taking the test and could go get another one if I needed to. This REALLY helped me focus because if you are like me and have ADHD, being able to “multitask” and do more than one thing at once during an exam is necessary. Electrolyte drinks are also a good bet, but avoid things like Redbull’s, Coffee, Alani’s, 5Energy, or Monster’s if they tend to make you more anxious. I slammed half of one 30 questions into my test and kind of regret it cause I could hear my own heartbeat, lol. 

PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR ACCOMMODATIONS:
A majority of state boards of nursing in the US have the same process for applying for and receiving disability accommodations on the NCLEX. You can find more resources on your state board of nursings website—they usually have a reserved section specifically for testing accommodations. 

Here’s an example from the Kansas State Board of Nursing
https://ksbn.kansas.gov/nclex-accommodations/

Step 1: Collect Documentation

Documentation must include a written report of an evaluation (educational, psychological, or physical) within the preceding five (5) years from a qualified professional which states a diagnosis of the disability, describes the disability, and recommends specific accommodations. If testing was completed more than two years prior to this request, a physician or psychologist must provide a summary stating why current testing is not needed (e.g., the disability does not change over time and new testing would not reveal new information).
Documentation must include the following:
* A professionally recognized diagnosis must be included in the documentation which the board receives from the candidate.
* A history of the disability and any past accommodation granted the candidate and a description of its impact on the individual’s functioning.
* Identification of the specific standardized and professionally recognized test/assessment given (e.g., Woodcock-Johnson, Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale).
* The scores resulting from testing, interpretation of the scores and evaluations.
* Recommendations for testing accommodations with a stated rationale as to why the requested accommodation is necessary and appropriate for the diagnosed disability (NCSBN 2007).

*** THE WOODCOCK-JOHNSON TEST OR WESCHLER ADULT INTELLIGENCE SCALE ARE NOT THE ONLY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THEY ALLOW. My physician submitted other tests, any should work as long as they are associated with a DSM. 


Step 2: Acquire Program Director’s Statement

A written statement from the candidate’s Program Director (or designee) which describes any testing accommodations made while the student was enrolled in the program.

** IT DOES NOT DISQUALIFY YOU IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS, THEY CAN JUST STATE YOU DID NOT RECEIVE ANY AND THE BOARD CAN DECIDE BASED ON INFORMATION THEY HAVE FROM YOUR PHYSICIAN AND FROM DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. 

Step 3: Send Application

A letter from the applicant requesting specific special accommodations and the accompanying documentation (steps 1 and 2) for the need of the accommodations must be submitted to the Kansas Board of Nursing with your application to test.

OVERALL: Disability accommodations are extremely helpful for some people during the NCLEX. Do not ever feel embarrassed or afraid to work with the Board of Nursing to get them. Nothing can be held against you as a nurse for disclosing diagnoses and they will not go in any sort of file once you receive your license. This is just to aid you in taking your NCLEX. 

Take care of yourself and PASS THAT TEST RN!!! You are deserving despite any struggles you may face!🤍🤍🤍

But I just wanted to do a little writing exercise to share my thoughts on what could happen in a potential third part to wrap up the main characters' arcs. Again, this is just my theory—it doesn’t mean this is the actual plot, or what I want, or anything like that. It’s simply what I believe Naughty Dog could bring us if it ever happens.**

**Abby and Lev arrive at the Fireflies’ base after the beach. After some time recovering and adjusting, Abby reconnects with several old acquaintances from the Salt Lake outpost. As they catch up on everything that’s happened, they talk about Joel’s fate and Ellie (the immune girl). This reignites the leadership’s desire to find a cure and track her down. For some reason, Lev senses something off about it and starts digging for answers. Eventually, he overhears a conversation among the Firefly leaders about capturing Ellie and developing a cure—not to help everyone, but to use it as a tool for power. Their plan is to dominate settlements and quarantine zones through extortion.**

**Lev is caught trying to warn Abby about these plans, which leads to a confrontation and their escape from the base.**

**After learning about the Fireflies’ intentions—and realizing she gave them Ellie’s possible location—Abby and Lev decide to head to Jackson to warn her. After several encounters and being pursued by the Fireflies, they finally reach Jackson. Lev is injured, and both are captured. While imprisoned in Jackson, they await a final decision on their fate, with Tommy pushing for their execution. Since Ellie never returned to Jackson, Dina visits Abby’s cell to find out why she’s there and whether she killed Ellie. This leads to a conversation about what happened on the beach and the Fireflies’ pursuit of Ellie.**

**Dina decides to trust Abby and helps her escape Jackson to search for Ellie. From that point on, they team up in the search. Lev stays behind in Jackson.**

**The next chapters would follow Ellie, living alone somewhere, while Abby and Dina search for her.**

**Eventually, after several encounters, they reunite. A confrontation occurs because Ellie believes Abby still wants to fight her, but Dina explains everything.**

**The final act could involve the Fireflies finding them, a battle breaking out, and Abby ultimately sacrificing herself for them—leading to the Fireflies’ defeat.**

**Comments:**

* Why do I think this could be the direction?
   * Ellie no longer feels guilty after realizing the Fireflies and the cure might not be the best outcome.
   * Dina and Ellie reunite and mend their relationship.
   * Abby finds redemption for what happened with Joel.
   * Ellie truly forgives Abby.
   * Lev becomes part of the Jackson community.

**Again, I’m not saying this is the best ending, or what I want, or that it’s based on any leaks. It’s just a theory that popped into my head while sipping coffee, and I felt like sharing it.**

**If it turns out to be nothing like this, that’s totally fine. But if it is… I’ll sue Naughty Dog... Just kidding. But it would be funny if I guessed their idea before they even announced it.**

**So please, don’t fight with me or each other over this. Just comment if you feel like it, and we’ll see in a few years… maybe. XD**",0,1752872867.0,thelastofus,4,0.5,False

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this abomination- I mean Post- and hopefully engage in this discussion! Thank you so much for your suggestions and help during this mental break of mine hahahaha

SO! I started a worm bin in March of 2024 We named it Walter.. I started it in a 17 gal bin, I bought maybe 250 worms? I did their bed all up like the interweb says to. I fed Walter on opposite sides about once a month (i know, looking back on that it was a terrible idea) all scraps that would keep it balanced (but only scraps and coffee grounds). So about 9 months ago, I upgraded them to a bigger 50 gal bin. I fed them the same way. Here is where the story goes sideways a bit. Towards the beginning of June I was getting worried due to the fact that my bin was just really clumpy and and it wasn't soft and light and airy. My best friend (who lives with us) has been managing Walter and feed it. It was dense and like piles of what seemed like just mud. well I learned it was WAY too wet and WE HAVENT BEEN ADDING NEW BEDDING!! I didn't know this was a required part. 

so... I freaked out. I bought a VermiHut. I made all new bedding with shredded newspaper, regular paper, cocoa coir. I read that I could mix in some of my old bin into the new bin for you know.... the microbes. So I did. I have a nursery tray at the bottom as we had TONS of babies (in hopes they migrate upwards to the food) and I have 3 active trays that I feed week and inspect weekly. I feed a healthy balance along with kelp meal, powdered eggshell, softened alfalfa pellets and so on. I add bedding also. 

Now... Here is my question.. How so I go about rotating this? I have watched a few vermicompsters on YT and this one  guy also runs 4 trays but has an inoculating tray on the very bottom (for 60 days) , next tier up is another inoculating tray (that just got moved up from the base) then he has a preharvest tray (that was previously the top feeding tray) then the top new feeding tray that was the other 3rd and oldest inoculating tray. Is this a good way to do this? My thoughts would be to have 3 active trays I'm feeding. The 2nd tier from the bottom had the least amount of worms (they all seem to be up top now) so when that tray was done I was going to stop feeding it. and let it rest to harvest. 

I honestly think I got so freaked out by my big bin cause I felt like I was drowning Walter that I rushed to try and save them and I made yet another mess. but.... their trays are really nice right now. Another question I have is WHEN DO I KNOW ITS ALL CASTINGS. I'm at a point where I feel like I don't know anything anymore. 

please help. MANY THANKS!  ",1,1752872780.0,Vermiculture,1,1.0,False

Amazon Prime Days 2025, held July 8th to 11th, held magical powers this year. Just say “PRIME DAYS!” and bippidi boppidi boo! Duggars appear on social media to sling links galore! My theory is that the saturation of links caused a bump in their sales, because the link slinging has continued farrrrr beyond Prime Days.  

Joy-Anna definitely earns the Prime Day Crown (at least as far as the Dugs are concerned…she still hasn’t reached her BFF Carlin’s status). She asked her followers what links they wanted, and then delivered: her favorite vacuum, lipstick, mascara, summer tees (the 90s called, and they want their striped tshirts back!), protein shake, air fryer, home favorites, non-toxic pots & pans, lamps, nightstand, charging station, hair cutting set (but only after Jana posted hers), tank tops, shorts, more clothes, tick spray, a bug zapper, swim suit, “outdoor summer favs,” “kids favs,” “Bible study favs,” and a MIRACLE-WORKING HONEY DISPENSER that has changed her life, now that she’s officially a “tea person” and a “kitchen gadget person.”

Jana re-emerged to Instagram with an un-holy vengeance, coming in strong for Joy-Anna’s Prime Day Crown. She linked to her favorite plants, laptop, watch and watchband, nail polish, Stanley mug, e-bikes, “boring” Keurig, flag pole, hair cutting kit & supplies (she beat Joy to that one), makeup remover, toothbrush, kitchen sponges, vitamins (we’ll come back to that later) and the little baggies she puts them in, hairbrush, alarm clock, refillable pump bottle dispensers, refillable olive oil sprayer, more plants, bedroom mirror, candelabra, above ground pool, summer dress, hair wax stick, more clothes, soap dispenser, camping items, nail polish, electrolyte drink mixes, and makeup (complete with makeup tutorial). 

Jessa takes the bronze metal, which is apropos because almost everything she shared is a shade of sad brown, tan, and beige…and has to do with the babies & pregnancy season of life: Orgain PB protein powder, Trainwell workout app, swaddles, nursing cover, baby monitor, prenatal vitamins, maternity tank tops, diaper pail, infant beanie hats, baby sleepers, and baby shoes. 

Coming in for a runner up ribbon is Jinger, who kept things simple by continuing to promote Truly (Not) Free products, teeth whitening strips, a griddle/grill combo from Costco, a backyard playground, a popcorn popper, and a dress from BSB that they no longer carry.

Jilly-Bean made half an attempt at promoting Prime Days, sharing two slides of links of her “faves”...and a shameless plug for her F’yall Memoir. 

Honorable Mention goes to J’Abbie, who resurfaced on Insta long enough to share her favorites for Prime Day: a robot vacuum, laundry cart, meat thermometer, tablecloth, bedding, knock-off Magnatiles, her favorite dress and shoes, and a turn table record player. (She then promptly receded back into Insta-obscurity.)

**WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN JANA’S (NOT) EXPECTING**

Jana sure likes to stir up the rumor mill. Some eagle-eyed snarkers spotted that the “vitamins” Jana was promoting on IG were fertility supplements, fitting for the queen bee of the fertility cult. I guess raising all of her younger siblings wasn’t enough, she needs some kids of her own. The supplements include Prenatal Hydrolyzed Collagen Protein Powder, Egg Quality Support, Prenatal Omega-3, Prenatal Pre/Pro-biotics, and “Preconception” CoQ10. That was enough to convince many that she’s already “expecting,” but a recent photo of her in a tank top and jeans put some of those rumors to rest. However, as I stated last week, “not visibly pregnant” isn’t the same as ""visibly not pregnant” when it comes to these girls. She is, however, still pregnant with smugness (or smudgeness, if you are an Office fan), still sporting that dated smuggy duck-face that she loves so much.

The Blissful Wissmans also went camping for Stephen’s birthday. They road their e-bikes and paddleboards, Stephen made all the breakfasts, they watched (Jana’s parent’s) church Sunday morning, Stephen went fishing using a bobber made out of a pill bottle while Jana took pictures and videos of him shirtless. (I was severely defrauded!) Jana also gave a tour of their pull-behind camper. 

**JILLY BEAN AND THE CUCAMELONS**

Jill’s account has been quieter than her sisters’ - mostly photos and videos of her garden and taller-than-Derick sunflowers (TIL what a “cucamelon” is), a photo of her Bible on Sunday morning, a shot of one of her boys with his face hidden by a “heat winner” swim team ribbon, and a few photos from a family outing to some kind of ice-cream place called Vargas Fruteria. (NGL - that place looks awesome.) 

**THE JESSA IS IN THE NEST!**

Jessa is about two weeks away from giving birth to her next Preacher or Plant. She posted a YouTube vlog reviewing some of her favorite baby products (the same color-less ones she shared on Instagram). She states “I feel like I have nested the entire nest and now I’m sitting on the nest and just waiting.” A few interesting tidbits from the video: 1) Their parsonage doesn’t have a lot of storage space because they closed in the carport to make their master bedroom, so she had to go out to the shed to get a duffel bag to pack for the hospital. I suppose that’s what happens when you put that many kids in a tiny house. 2) She has a conspiracy theory about her sciatica issues the last two pregnancies, that the pain is related to the last two births when she had botched first epidurals that needed redone. She thinks they nicked something that is now flaring up. Then again, she has a SIL with a bunch of kids who has had sciatic nerve pain too. So, her conspiracy theory might be true. Or it might be, just possibly, that she has had a bunch of kids? 3) After this many births, she considers herself a minimalist when it comes to the birthing “fluff” she used to care about (candles, the right playlist, etc.). She says, “That’s not really me.” 4) She’s on track to gain about 45lbs by the end of this pregnancy, and that three times in the last few weeks, she’s been asked if she’s having twins. But her last baby was 9lb14oz and she’s been working out this entire pregnancy. 5) They still don’t have a name picked out for baby, and apparently some of her other Preachers&Plants were named in the hospital after birth. She and Bin have only had about 3 conversations about baby’s name, because they are “very very last minute people” but have narrowed it down to 2 names. She doesn’t like any of the baby names she picked out when she was a teenager. (Does she still like the husband she picked out when she was a teenager?) 6) It’s the Year of our Lord Daniel 2025 and THEY DON’T HAVE WIFI!

**JINGE & JER EXPLOITA-CAST FEATURES GRIEVING SISTERS AND ABUSED PARENTS**

On the snoozecast last week, Jinger and Jeremy came out with a show that was all about infant loss, featuring her story and that of her sisters Jessa and Joy-Anna. I listened to the podcast, and it was surprisingly fairly decent. The girls were transparent and vulnerable (honestly Jessa showed more emotion in this episode than I knew she had). They had some good advice about how to navigate grief, how people can practically help, and things people should-shouldn’t say when interacting with a grieving parent. There was also a hefty about about how God and faith (or as Jer calls it “theological grounding”) enter into that picture for them, which was expected. But Jeremy’s interruptions were insufferable and infuriating. He declared that “I think it might be the most powerful episode we’ve done,” and it just went downhill from there. Every comment he made was pious and preachy know-it-all-ish (like explaining miscarriage statistics). This episode would have been SO much more powerful had he shut up and let the girls tell their stories without commentary. There was also a shout-out to the “incredible woman” Michelle Duggar, who is “amazing” and “there for every single one of her children when you’re giving birth, when in the midst of loss…she forgets herself and gets lost in serving” and is “the paradigm” of how people should support those in need. (Are we talking about the same “Teet ‘em & yeet ‘em” Michelle Duggar?) Season/seasons/season-of-life count: 10

The thumbnails for their IG reels detracted from any goodness that could have been found in the podcast. The clickbait were images of her sisters crying with captions like “I WAS DEVASTATED!”, “WE FELT SO ALONE”, and “THE FEAR NO ONE TALKS ABOUT.” It felt incredibly invasive and exploitative, but what’s new? The worst one was the thumbnail of Jer in a hat and “GOOD RANCHERS” shirt with the caption “YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE HOPELESS.” Thanks, Jer. Now that you’ve told me this, I feel so much better! 

I haven’t listened to the exploita-cast they dropped this yet, but it features Jer’s parents talking about domestic violence and recovering from abuse, so we have more exploitation to look forward to! Queue the clickbait thumbnails…

Jeremy has also been sharing Bible reading tips on his Instagram, which might be informative if I wasn’t so distracted by his obnoxious tshirts and hats. He’s also still trying to make blurry photos a genre. Stop trying to make it happen, Jer. It’s not gonna happen!! 

Jer’s idol J’MAC passed away this week, which led Jinger to post a picture of them with him with the caption “our dear pastor has finished well 🙏 he will be greatly missed.” I’m sure there will be a lot more J’MAC content from them this week when he’s laid to rest. 

**JUMPING FOR JOY!**

Austin gifted Joy-Anna a (local) girls trip with some friends for Mother’s Day (kudos to him!), and she cashed that in this week. I completely expected her friends to be Katey, Abbie, DrewsGirl, or Kendra…but she surprised me by going on this trip with 3 friends I’ve never seen on her IG before. (Some of them looked to be maybe a decade older. I dunno…I suck at guessing ages. Let me rephrase. They looked like women who were NOT knocked up as girls barely out of their teens.) They went antiquing, ate Cuban food, played Apples to Apples, drank coffee…fairly typical evangelical Christian vanilla moms stuff…that is until they started jumping on the beds at their AirBnB at midnight. Snarkers are divided on the appropriateness of this activity. 

Following in Carlin’s footsteps, Joy exploited her kids a LOT these last few weeks…berry picking, playing, eating snacks, watching Veggie Tales, going to the dentist, etc. She posted a reel of her telling her son something in a VERY EXCITED VOICE just to see how he would react (maybe this is an IG or TikTok trend). He repeated everything she said also in a very excited voice. Shocker. But my personal favorite is when she posted a picture of her Bible and said, “the kids nap time is my quite time.” SOTDRT strikes again. 

**“TWIN MOM” BECOMES KATHY’S TOP PERSONALITY TRAIT** 

Jed & Katey celebrated their twins turning 6 months old, saturating their Insta with a lot of twin content. She reshared pictures of their twin jinder reveal and a reel of her twins in walkers following her with their eyes…set to the song Somebody’s Watching Me. She also posted a cringy reel about how Jed leaving for work every morning while she’s stuck at home with 4-under-4 is an “actual tragedy” - she then chases him down and jumps on his back so he won’t go. It’s all set to P!nk’s “Please Don’t Leave Me.” It might be humorous if the honest desperation weren’t so palpable. 

Jed & Katey are also following in Boob’s footsteps by hitting up a restaurant where “Kids Eat Free All Summer.” Like father, like son. The more the kids the higher the savings! 

On their latest YouTube video, they document their recent trip to Disney. They brought along Katey’s mom and sister so that the adult to kid ratio was 1:1. Which sounds smart, but if your kids are so young you have to pay to bring people to Disney to care for your kids 1) you might have too many little kids and 2) your kids are probably too young to enjoy Disney and 3) you are wasting a ton of money. 

They had a tough start to the trip because they didn’t have their twin’s birth certificates with them (which they hadn’t gotten back from the government yet?!?!) so had to buy extra tickets for the infants. After a recovery day, they hit Magic Kingdom, which a haggard Kathy says is “pretty magical.” Spending NINE HOURS at theme park with 2 preschoolers and 2 infants looks anything but “magical” - and Katey doesn’t do much to change my mind. They needed another recovery day before a final day at Hollywood Studios. 

They got home and Jed and TruJed jedded ✈️off to Texas to pick up a Grand Wagoneer that Jed found after doing “research.” It was kinda cute seeing Jed and TruJed hanging out, going to Bass Pro Shops, and fishing in between picking up the car and driving it home. He even asked TruJed if he wanted to grow up and fly a plane like his Mommy does, reminding everyone that Kathy does have a life beyond popping out babies. BUT, when Jed was talking, but off-screen…he sounded JUST like Sex Pest, which was unnerving. Katey LOVES the new car, which is “a dream car, perfect, a good family car, but also a fancy mom car.”

**NEWLYWED ESCAPADES**

Jason and Maddie seem in no hurry to pop out kiddos but rather seem to be enjoying married life just the two of them. They recently completed Maddie’s first escape room. Their first vlog documented a recent trip to the beach somewhere in Alabama, where they gathered with both Maddie’s parents and some of Jase’s family before enjoying some time on their own. The vlog featured riveting content of Ice cream and coffee shop outings, a visit to a restaurant where people throw rolls at you, a Walmart run where they looked at coffee mugs, an “intense competition” playing the old game Perfection, Bible study, more shopping and eating out, buying gifts for their twin nieces (Maddie trying to win the title of “favorite aunt” - a hard task in this family!), and beach time. Maddie is the spicy one in the relationship, ordering delicacies like avocado toast, Matcha, and seafood while Jase sticks to his boring vanilla latte and non-seafood entrees. They did go to a beef jerky place and tried ostrich, kangaroo, alligator, and wild boar jerky. There was a quick pan of one of their dinner tables where Maddie had some kind of drink in what looked like a champagne flute, but I can’t confirm whether it was alcoholic or not. She also wore a lot of Nike clothes. 

**BABY-MAMAS STAY BUSY WITH BURN BOOT CAMP**

Since our last Duggar Digest, Katey (2x), Joy (2x), Lauren (1x), Kendra (6x), and Kendra’s workout skirt (also 6x) were spotted in the Burn Boot Camp’s IG stories. Gotta keep those baby making machines healthy! 

**MISSING LOST KIDS SPOTTED ON YOUTUBE**

Justin, Jennifer, J’Hannie, Jordyn, and Josie were all spotted in quick background pans in their siblings YouTube videos. #wheresjenni hashtag is no longer trending. (However, only J’Hannie sang in the church choir this week.)

**PICKLES:**

Pickles were scattered across the Dugs feeds this week. Jill made 24 hour refrigerator pickles. Jason showed the 4 bags of cucumbers his family brought when they met up at their Alabama beach house “You know it was a Duggar vacation if there’s like four bags of mini-cucumbers.” He also shared the “This Ken is a Pickle Lover” meme of his younger self holding a pickle with the Barbie logo that I guess Maddie made? And Hannah shared a picture of one of their J’Babies holding cucumbers from their garden. 

**TATOR TOTS: THIS AND THAT FROM THE DUGGARVERSE**

This week I learned that Deanna Duggar put out a Christian album called “He Came Down From Glory” about a decade ago, featuring “Special Guest Artist: Amy Duggar.” You can still find it on YouTube if you are interested in going down that rabbit hole.

Amy featured a lot of Daxy’s friends in her stories this week, saying “I’ll protect them like they are my own!” (Yet she put them on Insta…so I’m not sure she realizes what protection actually is.) She & Deanna did a lot of thrifting at a local thrift store that they shop at because they have a sign offering “Free Prayer.” (I hope that means they are avoiding all the other money hungry thrift shops that charge for prayer. I wonder what the going rate is in NWA…)

The Pecan Thieves and their brood of P’s and D’s wore matching outfits and rode a classic Ford pickup truck in their town’s 4th of July parade to pass out tracts and candy and promote their church. (BTW - from some internet sleuthing, I also realized that the Spivey’s attend said church. I hadn’t made that connection before…maybe I’m slow.)

1m3dwjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/oregon/comments/1m3dwjw/howdy_ya/,howdy ya,"Hi, I have been doing some research and I am looking to move out of Texas for various reasons. And I see Oregon as a good state to start. I was considering moving to Washington but changed my mind (but still on the table). But I do have a few questions about the state. I won’t make my move until two years later when I am ready and save enough money to do the move out there. I am planning to take a vacation to see how it is out there too next year.  
  


[1.jobs](http://1.jobs)

what jobs are there that pay well (over $20 pr.hr.) with 401k/health benefits. I work mainly in a manufacturing factory. And I work a 2-2-3 schedule in a 12hrs rotation shift. But I am looking to get away from that. Somewhere from monday to friday kinda jobs. And don’t mind working on the weekend. I prefer doing the four day ten hour shifts and get the weekend off. Also are their unions in that state too.  
  


2. housing

right now due to the housing crisis we’re in. I am living in an apartment, mainly one bedroom. The city I am looking to move to is in Portland or Salem. I need to know what apartments I should look into that aren't bad or ghetto ( I live in a few so I have been through them). Also a bit outside of the city then downtown or close to downtown.  
  


3. culture

What is the culture out there is like comparing where I am from in Texas. Someone told me that Portland is like living in Austin. Are there any good events happening like comic/anime/retro video games/tech cons (yeah I’m a bit of a nerd). even music events like metal and raves. Also how the people in Oregon compare to Texas. Is it lay back and nice also friendly  
  


4. traffic

compare Texas to Oregon, how the roads and highways are like. I can stand Austin traffic but I hate Houston and Dallas traffic. I give credit to Dallas since they do label their roads of what route you're on before you exit. Unlike Houston, people can’t seem to use their signal light.  
  


5. food

And before you ask, yes I love bbq but I am mexicano. I gotta have my temales, torillas, beans and menudo. I heard Oregon is a coast like food as in sea food. I never had that many options eating sea food here in Texas but I am willing to try. Also I head when going to the west side of the state. The soda option is different out there. Here in Texas we have “big red” soda which is a thing ( I don’t like it) but we also do have H-E-B brand soda like all sorts of fruit soda that is made with real sugar cane but that is only seasoning. Same thing as in coffee, I love my cafe heb coffee of the san antonio flavor. What will I see out there in the soda and coffee market?

  
  


6. weather

Also I heard in Oregon it is cooler out there and it does get hot in the upper 90s during the summer time? I could be wrong. Also, it rains a lot. Here in Texas and yes it is very true. It can get up to upper 100s even at night when it is 92 degrees. But during the cooler season. Texas does get cool until around late november to early february. And spring time for us is more like March and late April.  
  


And yes we went through crazy snow and ice fronts. My first taste of real snow.  
  


Does it snow out there a lot and do I really need snow tires in order to drive around town?  
  


I hope ya can answer some of the questions I posted. And if ya got some good idea spots I should check out when going on vacation next year to check out the state. Please let me know about that too.

Okay, seriously, I've been messing around with crypto for a while now, and one of the biggest headaches has always been actually using the stuff. I've tried a few services trying to bridge that gap, and let's just say it's been a rocky road. But then I stumbled upon [Kryptokarte.com](https://Kryptokarte.com), and folks, it's been a game-changer. The biggest selling point for me? **No KYC!** I'm not trying to buy a house, I just want to use my crypto for everyday stuff without jumping through hoops and sending my passport to a stranger on the internet. Kryptokarte delivers on that promise, and it’s been incredibly liberating. I can finally treat my crypto like actual money without the usual identity verification drama.

The versatility of this virtual card is what really blew me away.

Imagine walking into a coffee shop and paying with your Bitcoin – that’s the kind of future we were promised, and [Kryptokarte ](http://Kryptokarte.com)is actually delivering it. The ease of management through their personal account dashboard is also a huge plus; I can see my transactions, top up easily, and just generally have a clear overview of everything without any complicated interfaces.

Honestly, I was a bit skeptical at first, given how many ""solutions"" out there are either scams or just don't work as advertised. But [Kryptokarte ](http://Kryptokarte.com)has consistently impressed me. The ""high passability"" they claim actually holds true – I haven't had a single transaction declined, which is more than I can say for other services I've tried. Plus, their commitment to ""no issues with refunds"" is something I haven't had to test personally yet, but just knowing it's a priority gives me peace of mind. If you're like me and you've got crypto sitting there, earning nothing, and you want a simple, secure, and genuinely useful way to spend it online (and even offline!), then you absolutely need to check out Kryptokarte. It's made my crypto journey so much more practical and less of a headache. Highly recommended!

# Best Milk with Cream on Top [2025]: Reviews & Guide

Milk with cream on top, frequently enough referred to as non-homogenized milk, represents a return to traditional dairy practices. This type of milk retains its natural fat globules, which rise to the surface and form a rich, creamy layer. For consumers seeking a more wholesome and flavorful milk experience, milk with cream on top provides a appetizing and unique alternative to homogenized milk. It offers a richer texture, a more pronounced milky flavor, and the added benefit of consuming milk processed in a less manipulated manner. It appeals to those who value natural foods, traditional methods, and a heightened sensory experience.

[[Explore top Rated milk with cream on top on amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=milk with cream on top)

## Key Features Analysis

Raw milk is often the base of this dairy product; however, regulations vary by state.

**Non-Homogenized Process:** Non-homogenized milk is not forced through a fine filter at high pressure,a process that breaks down fat globules and distributes them evenly throughout the milk. This means the cream naturally separates and rises to the top. The absence of homogenization preserves the integrity of the milkS natural components and distinctive flavor.

**Natural Fat Separation:** The most distinguishing feature is the visible layer of cream that forms on the surface. This cream is rich in butterfat,giving the milk a luxurious texture and a more pronounced dairy flavor. The thickness and richness of the cream layer can vary depending on the breed of cow, the feed they consume, and the processing methods used.

**Minimal Processing:** Typically, milk with cream on top undergoes minimal processing beyond pasteurization, which heats the milk to kill harmful bacteria. Some producers offer raw milk, which is unpasteurized, but its availability is subject to local regulations as it contains a variety of naturally forming bacteria. The gentle handling of the milk preserves more of its natural enzymes and vitamins, contributing to its nutritional value and flavor profile.

**Glass Bottle Packaging:** many producers of milk with cream on top opt for traditional glass bottles. This packaging not only evokes a sense of nostalgia but also helps to maintain the milk's freshness and prevent any unwanted flavors from leaching into the product. Glass is easily recyclable, further appealing to environmentally conscious consumers.Key features of milk with cream on top include:

*   Non-homogenized nature
*   Distinct cream layer
*   Minimal processing
*   Frequently enough packaged in glass bottles

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Flavor:** Many consumers find that milk with cream on top has a richer, more nuanced flavor compared to homogenized milk. The cream layer adds a decadent, buttery taste that enhances the overall drinking experience. This enhanced flavor profile makes it ideal for drinking straight, adding to coffee, or using in recipes where a richer dairy flavor is desired.

**Improved Texture:** The presence of the cream layer contributes to a smoother, more luxurious texture. The cream can be mixed into the milk for a richer, creamier drink, or it can be spooned off and enjoyed separately. This textural complexity elevates the sensory experience of drinking milk.

**Perceived Health Benefits:** While not definitively proven, some believe that non-homogenized milk is easier to digest due to the larger fat globules. Additionally, the minimal processing may preserve more of the milk's natural enzymes and vitamins, contributing to its overall nutritional value. Sourcing directly from local farms provides the added benefit of traceability and awareness of farming practices.

Alright so back story I recently went off birth control to try another method and I am waiting for my appointment. My boyfriend and I agreed we'd use condoms for the time being however on July 5 my boyfriend and I did the deed. It was a drunken night ( we are both of legal drinking age) and in said drunken night he decided he could pull out no need for condoms I say ok sounds good ( dumb choice on my end) and well he didn't pull out. The next morning I take a plan b pill fast forward to July 17 I thought I started my period but it is more like spotting and it is super light pink and also brown and today same thing except around 11am it stopped.  I looked at my period tracker today and it says July 5 I was ovulating and I took a pregnancy test today it came up negative. Is this just symptoms of the plan b or should I wait and re-take a pregnancy test in a week. Has anyone had a similar situation happen and can give any insight.

1m3dl8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/DID/comments/1m3dl8u/how_to_find_a_therapist/,How to find a Therapist,"I own a nonprofit helping people who dissociate find specialists. This is one way you can locate a therapist. If you aren't successful by doing this, I recommend that when doing a search, you scroll down through search results to see who comes up privately, outside the Psychology Today links.

**WHY A SPECIALIST**

First, look for a therapist who has the right skills. For people who dissociate, trauma therapy seems like the exact thing you need, but you need to go a step further—a dissociative specialist. They use different tools than all other therapists, and they know to treat it gently. They have the skills to help prevent your mind from going into chaos by going slowly, using EMDR modified for DID and combining it with parts work (IFS or Ego State). To get these skills, you’ll need to broaden your search outside your immediate area and do online therapy if no one is close.

Benefits of online therapy:  
You don’t have to drive.  
You get to sit in your favorite place and snuggle with whatever you want for that day.  
You can have your own coffee or drink close by.  
If you’ve cried during therapy, no one will see you until you’re ready.  
If you get tired from therapy, you can take an immediate nap.  
You can sit in your own quiet space to spend time taking notes or reflecting afterwards.

 **THE SEARCH**

 Google: Dissociative Identity Disorder therapist \[state, country or province\]

 Select the Psychology Today link.

 Once open, click the blue FILTERS button

 DO NOT select online therapy—it will incorrectly skew your results.

 Select preferred gender of therapist, if any.

 Select your INSURANCE.

Under TYPES OF THERAPY select EMDR and Internal Family Systems (IFS) (if you only have a few results, uncheck the IFS box, as you'll be looking for therapists who offer Ego State, which isn't available to filer)

Click the blue SHOW x THERAPISTS button, which will populate a list of therapists.

**BIOS**

Open each therapist’s bio and read what they’ve written. Some therapists list more types of therapies they offer that aren’t listed below, so definitely pay attention to this area.

Scroll down to SPECIALTIES AND EXPERTISE. I *prefer* this list to be long, but sometimes therapist’s group skills together. Besides Dissociation, look for other disorders related to it, like Borderline, Bipolar, Narcissism, Eating Disorders, PTSD, CPTSD, Autism, Neurodivergence, Mood and Personality Disorders.

Scroll down to TYPES OF THERAPIES. I also *prefer* this list to be fairly long, but it’s ok if it’s not. The most important things to look for are EMDR and IFS or Ego State. Also look for therapies like DBT, Schema, Gestalt and Somatic that can be helpful.

Email up to 20 therapists at a time. If your list is really short, go back to filters and deselect IFS. Look to see there are more therapists in the list and check to see who offers Ego State. Give the therapists at least a week or two to respond.

If you have no responses after a week, repeat this process. New therapists appear all the time.

**EMAIL**

When you email, I recommend something along the lines of: I am looking for a therapist who has already has experience treating DID using EMDR modified for DID and parts work. Please contact me if you offer these modalities and have the experience I'm seeking.

\*\*\*I posted another thread with How to Interview a Therapist today.

**Clarification of Therapy Types**

Bottom-up therapy: EMDR, Brainspotting, Ego State, IFS and Somatic Experiencing. These heal at the root from the bottom of the brain to the top.

Top-down Therapy: CBT, DBT, Schemic, Gestalt, and all other therapies. These work from the top down, focus on changing thoughts, behaviors and emotions.

**NOTE**: none of this is going to be perfect for everyone. This is general information to help get you started. Also, some people prefer not to use EMDR or IFS, which are the proven successful modalities. No problem! Simply change your search criteria to match what you prefer.

So thought I would try her out . She claimed to have had high standards . Her first visit took a bit of extra time and she claimed to have cleaned areas that the previous cleaner had ignored - which was theoretically believable as the previous cleaner I had hired wasn’t very good . But I never really noticed that much as I’m not that picky . 
The next few visits she started bringing other people with her kind of randomly and eventually another subcontracted cleaner showed up ( let’s call her #4 ) who came a few times . The last cleaning visit by # 4  was  shoddy - missed dusting most everywhere , left laundry out , garbage on the countertops, dishes in the sink, bedspreads left in a pile  . Even I noticed it . Spent a fair bit of time , ( like 30 minutes ) gabbing over a coffee . I was not impressed . I mentioned this to her boss ( who I had originally had contracted ) and agreed that some things had been missed but told me that putting dishes into a dishwasher would be extra . I was like - WTF ? Somebody who claims to have high standards tells me that putting dishes into a dishwasher would cost extra ? How hard can that be ? I miss my original house cleaner who would basically do anything within reason within a 4 hour time slot and at half the price . I guess my question is how common is it for simple tasks to be up charged ?

Trying my hardest to yell over the screaming motors of the vintage, borderline antique bikes we had, I motioned for Ethan to pull over and stop. 

Air whipping through the small cracks between the eye cover of my helmet I could barely hear myself shouting “PULL THE FUCK OVER! WHAT ARE YOU DOING” while waving one free hand as to not let go of the throttle and lose pace with my seemingly hypnotized relative. He didn’t even glance over. I got ahead of him and tried stopping, then I heard the squeal of his tire and knew he locked his rear brake up. That didn’t take him from his goal though, as he flew past my left side missing me by inches, he slid past me at a 45° angle before I heard the roar of his engine and watched is tail light dance to and fro in a fish tail  before straightening up and crawling ahead of me again. I was dead set on finding out what’s gotten into him, so my safest option was to just follow. 

After almost an hour of chasing Ethan, we passed an sign. “PEOTONE EXIT 1 MILE” Now usually you’d see road signs advertising for food or lodging, and Peotone had them, but they were empty. Four or five rusted, still reflective in some spots, yet blank ad signs. Ethan pops his blinker on, this must be where he thinks we need to be. It wasn’t a large town, more of a village honestly. I know because I followed Ethan as he took to the streets like the Nokia snake, feverishly snapping his head back and forth in search of…well even now, after it all, I still don’t exactly know what it was. I do know that I wish he’d never found it. 

I don’t remember falling asleep, shit, I don’t even remember when I stopped chasing Ethan. I remember yelling out to him after our third lap through this insignificant grid system of a town, and I remember seeing his brake light come to life. Then I heard that same, bliss filled, painful cry of the agriculture we camped in that night. Then, nothing. But what I do remember, was the nightmare I had. I was in a gas station. The clerk was your regular small town old man. Just a crown of thin, gray hair resting atop his over grown ears, with strands poking out from inside them to match his head. A short, round man with a waddle to go with it. The weird thing was, he had a similar wine stain on his cheek, like the worker from Walmart. When I went to check out, he rose his head for our eyes to meet and they burst with that same brilliant light we had seen before. The same illumination infiltrated the tall windows in front of the store as that shrill sound of the wind and crowd of moans overwhelmed my senses. Next thing I know we woke up in this roach motel on the outskirts of Peotone. I was on the floor and Ethan was halfway hanging off the futon, like he was dragged in and dumped off. 

“Ethan…” I whispered. This time with more vigor as I shook him by the shoulder, futon springs creaking as he bounced, “Ethan! Wake up!” 

“Ugh, what the hell Derrick? What time is it?”

Ignoring the question, I was still whispering. I felt like someone might be listening, “Where the fuck are we? Do you remember checking out a room?”

Rightfully confused, he sat up and looked at me with a furrowed brow before examining our dilapidated surroundings, “Hey man, where are we?”

Still hushed I replied,
“Thats what im trying to figure out, and keep your voice down!”

Ethan continued at a regular volume “For what? Is someone els-“

“Shhh Ethan shut the fuck up! I don’t know. Lets just get out of here and figure out whats up” 

It was as strange as it was lucky that the place we inhabited was vacant. Not realizing how much the dirt coated windows blocked out light, the Sun was blinding when it sliced through the door as I cracked it open to leave. To add to what felt like luck, our bikes were parked neatly out front, nothing missing or otherwise out of place. That was until we tried riding into town. I kicked a leg over, flicked the ignition switch on, and hit the starter. Nothing. Not even a sputter. I looked at Ethan suffering the same fate. After checking all we knew to check, battery connections, fuses, solenoids, we couldn’t chase down the issue with either ride. 

Ethan finally breaking the frustrated and confused silence “Well what now?” 

“Fuck if I know. Im still trying to remember how we even got here.”

“I mean obviously we drove here right? Got lucky with a furnished bando, decided to crash here instead of a field for once.” 

I slowly turned my head and refrained to insult his intelligence before answering “Thats an insane thought, and even if it was what happened, why don’t we remember any of it? Matter of fact, why did you take off on me last night?”

Ethan looked at me, almost convincing me he didn’t know what I meant “What are you talking about? I never took off on you.” 

“You-“ I had to stop and collect myself before losing my cool, I exhaled and sternly asked “You dont remember leaving camp last night? Like at all? We saw that weird pink flash and you started acting crazy and shit”

“Pink flash? Are you okay Derrick? You sound fucked right now”

Officially losing my cool I shouted “I SOUND FUCKED? Ethan you said we should check out the flash of light we saw in the field last night, grabbed all of your shit, and sped off on me. You wouldn’t answer anything I said. Are you fucking with me right now? You have to be fucking with me.” 

“Dude relax for a second. I genuinely don’t know what youre talking about. I remember riding all day and being exhausted, talking to that girl on my phone and then…”

“Then what? what do you remember?”

“Shit, I dont know. I can’t think of what happened next.” 

“Well let me refresh your memory…”

“Can we do it over breakfast? They gotta have somewhere to eat in this podunk metropolis and I could use a bite” 

Finally strolling into town, we got a booth with cracked pleather seats and a yellowing table from what I’d bet used to be the smoking section, deduced by the black melted spots on the tabletop, at a diner in what they call the downtown area. It was one street, well, one block really, that had more bars than anything else. The diner sat on the corner of it all. I filled Ethan in on what I remembered as we walked into town and now he was quizzing me over arguably the worst tasting, but much needed coffee our waitress dropped off. 

Ethan started,
“Okay, so…hold on. It was windy but it wasn’t?”

“No! I mean, sorta. It sounded like gusts of wind but we couldn’t feel any wind. Then there was like, moaning too. It was so creepy” doing my best to fill in any gaps in my memory as I recounted them. 


“Like sexy moaning?”
He asked with an eyebrow cocked up

Letting out a chuckle at the absurdity I answered,
“Honestly yeah, it was so uncomfortable”

Shaking his head he continued,
“And then that light flashed, and I took off and brought us here”

“Mhm, you wouldn’t answer anything I said. You were in a trance or something. Almost crashed into me when I tried stopping you”

“Well, we did drink all of our beer.”

“You ever trip off of beer? Get real dude, something weird as fuck happened to us.” 

“Ugh fine, I’ll bite. What do you think happened?”

“I have no idea, thats what im saying. I was behind you while you were taking laps around this ghost town and after a few, I woke up on the floor of that motel.”

“Well, we have plenty of time to try and figure it out while our bikes get fixed.” Ethan answered distracted by his phone chime. He pulled it from the inside pocket of his newer denim jacket, it was still jet black and had an Evil Dead embroidery on the chest. I was a little jealous, that jacket was cool as hell. I’d never let him know I thought that. Call it what you want, hubris is probably the best descriptor though. 

“Oh shit!” He said a little too loud for our small town cafe setting. Then he looked up at me bright eyed and grinning for the first time since we shared stories around our fire. 
“That girl-“
I cut him off “for fucks sake man, this is still a thing? You dont think we have better shit to worry about right now?”

“I don’t know Derrick, we got all pissed up on that 12 pack, and we smoked that joint you brought. It was probably laced.” 

“First off, that was straight from a dispensary, so theres no way-“ before I could continue the defense of my state regulated substance, the waitress came back. 

“What’re y’all havin’ ta eat?” She asked with her strangely southern accent. The midwest is weird like that, sometimes people pick up a drawl from who knows where. Anyway, I rifled off my order for a greek omelette and hash browns, and while Ethan was ordering his food I glanced up at our server. I had a hard time making eye contact with anyone as a kid, never grew out of it, so I rarely look at who I’m telling my order but I don’t mean anything by it. But when I finally looked at the taller, red haired dining server in her outdated uniform, like she worked at a malt shop on the set of Grease, I noticed something that stole all the color from my face. She had that same sweet red streak, that just so happened to run underneath her left eye. Just like the man in my dream. Just like the man in Walmart…

1m3ddbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTTheater/comments/1m3ddbz/simple_explanation_of_python_coding_with_these/,"Simple Explanation of Python Coding! With these ChatGPT explanations, easily understand the entire Python structure for a Quick Start.","---

**Me**: *I have a basic understanding of coding. Let's explore together how someone interested in learning to code can do it in the fastest way possible. Since Python is almost universal in programming, simple, yet practical and powerful, let's mostly focus on it. First, tell me: if we want to categorize all the components of a complete Python code, how many categories are there, what are their names, and what is the use of each category in simple terms, with a relatable daily-life example.*

**ChatGPT**: To build a complete Python program, we can divide its components into six categories:

1. Variables – store data. Like a labeled jar in your kitchen: `sugar = ""sweet""`
2. Data Types – define kind of data (string, integer, list). Like recognizing sugar is powder, eggs are countable, temperature is float.
3. Operators – do actions (like `+`, `-`). Like combining two ingredients in a recipe.
4. Control Structures – decide flow: `if`, `for`, `while`. Like deciding ""if it's raining, take umbrella"".
5. Functions – reusable actions. Like “boil water” you call anytime.
6. Libraries/Modules – external tools. Like calling a friend to help cook a complex meal you can't do alone.

- Each part lets you write logic in pieces: store info, process, react, organize, and expand with tools. Example: making a grocery list app needs variables (items), loops (check stock), conditions (if out, buy), functions (total cost), and possibly a module (like date/time).
So thinking like this makes coding feel like organizing your day logically and efficiently.

---

**Me**: *Now consider a simple event that everyone is familiar with. Choose this event so that its components resemble the functions of a complete Python code. While describing the event, explain how each component of it acts like the parts you previously explained. What is the benefit of each part, and how does the main goal of this event align with the goal of coding?*

**ChatGPT**: Let’s take making breakfast as the real-life event.

1. Variables: You first gather ingredients—eggs, bread, butter. These are like variables holding your data: `eggs = 2`, `bread = 3 slices`.
2. Data Types: Each ingredient has a type—eggs (integer), butter (float), toaster status (boolean: on/off). You’re managing different types of info, just like in Python.
3. Operators: You combine things. You fry eggs (`pan + oil + eggs`) or toast bread (`toaster + bread`). These are operations modifying your data.
4. Control Structures: You follow logic. If no bread, make oatmeal. If butter is frozen, microwave it. Loops repeat: stir eggs until cooked. So `if`, `else`, `while` structures are at play.
5. Functions: You repeat actions, like “crack egg” or “butter toast.” You don’t rethink each step—just apply it. That’s like calling `def crack_egg()` instead of rewriting it every time.
6. Libraries/Modules: You might use a blender, microwave, or recipe book—external tools with complex functionality, like importing a Python module (`import time`, `import random`) to expand your abilities.

- Goal Alignment: Making breakfast = producing a result (a meal) through structured steps. Programming = producing an output (like an app or result) by defining inputs, logic, and tools.
- In both, your goal is to transform raw inputs into something useful, efficiently and repeatedly.
- Coding isn’t magic—it’s organizing life’s logic like cooking: plan, decide, reuse, and serve.

---

**Me**: *I noticed that you sometimes use terms that may be difficult for a beginner, like “function” and “using it from a module.” Let’s do this: use a function or a small module in a specific example. I remember understanding libraries was hard for me. Also, explain how special characters are used to call parts of the module and how you communicate what you expect from it.*

**ChatGPT**: Great. Let’s say we want to choose a random fruit from a list. That’s a simple task, and we’ll use a function from a module.

***Step 1*** – Problem:
We want the computer to choose one fruit from a list like `[""apple"", ""banana"", ""orange""]`.

***Step 2*** – Use a Module:
Python has a built-in module called `random` that helps with random choices. But the function we need is not active by default—we have to import it.

***Step 3*** – Code with explanation:

```
import random  # this tells Python to bring in the ""random"" toolbox

fruits = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""orange""]  # our list (variable)

chosen = random.choice(fruits)  # use the 'choice' function from 'random' module

print(""Selected fruit:"", chosen)  # show result
```

***Step 4*** – Explanation in simple terms:
- import random: You tell Python, ""Hey, I need the random toolbox.""
- random.choice(fruits): You say, “From the toolbox, use the tool called choice and give it this list.”
- The dot . means: “from inside”. Like saying: “From the fridge (random), give me the eggs (choice).”
- The module is like a box full of ready-made tools. But tools don’t work unless you say:
1. Which box you want (import random)
2. Which tool from inside it (random.choice)
3. What input to give the tool (your list)

- You’re also communicating your expectation to the function. When you write random.choice(fruits), you’re saying:
“Here is a list—your job is to pick one item from it randomly.”
- So with just one line—random.choice(fruits)—you call, give data, and expect a result.
- That’s the magic of modules: short commands that do smart work—but you control the input and result clearly.

---

**Me**: *Now write a complete sample code that obviously has no errors. Label its parts using the six categories we discussed, and explain for each code line what the machine actually understands from it, how it stores that code, where it uses it, and how.*

**ChatGPT**: Let’s write a small Python program that asks for your name and age, calculates your birth year, and prints a message.

1. Variables:
```
name = input(""Enter your name: "")
age = int(input(""Enter your age: ""))
```
Machine Understanding:

- Creates a memory spot labeled `name` and stores user’s input as a string.
- Then creates `age` and stores the number (converted using `int()`).
- Stored In: RAM.
- Used In: Later calculations and messages.

2. Data Types: 
- `name` is a string.
- `age` is an integer.
- Data types define how much space is needed and what actions are allowed (e.g., you can’t subtract strings).

3. Operators: 
```
birth_year = 2025 - age
```
Machine Understanding:

- Subtracts the number in `age` from 2025.
- Stores result in `birth_year`.
- Stored In: RAM as integer.
- Used In: Message later.

4. Control Structure:
```
if age < 0:
    print(""Are you from the future?"")
else:
    print(""Hello"", name)
```
Machine Understanding:

- Checks if age is less than 0.
- Chooses which block to run.
- Stores no new data but alters the flow.
- Used In: Decision-making.

5. Functions: 
```
def welcome(name):
    print(""Welcome,"", name)
welcome(name)
```
Machine Understanding:

- Stores the action ""print welcome message"" under the name `welcome`.
- Doesn’t run it until `welcome(name)` is called.
- Stored In: RAM as callable object.
- Used In: Called when needed.

6. Modules: 
```
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
```
Machine Understanding:

- Loads `datetime` toolbox into memory.
- Grabs the tool `now()` from inside.
- Saves current time to `now`.
- Used In: Optional tracking, timestamps, logs, etc.

Full Program Recap:

- Memory stores data in variables.
- Code defines what to do.
- Control picks when to do.
- Functions let you reuse.
- Modules bring powerful tools inside.
- Operators help compute.
- Machine keeps it all in memory and runs step by step.

---

**Me**: *You’ve used the word “function” multiple times. Can you show how a function is actually stored inside a module? I mean, what does the code of that function itself look like? Name the types of functions, and explain the different kinds of code used to work with functions in various ways.*

**ChatGPT**: Great. Let’s explore functions from the inside out.

1. How a Function Exists Inside a Module:
Modules in Python often contain many predefined functions, written using the def keyword. Here’s how a typical function looks inside a module like math:
```
# inside math module (simplified version)
def sqrt(x):
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError(""Cannot take square root of negative number"")
    return x ** 0.5
```
- This function named sqrt accepts one input x, checks for a valid value, then returns its square root.
- When you write import math, this entire sqrt definition (plus others) becomes available in memory.
- Then math.sqrt(9) literally means: go inside math, find sqrt, give it 9.

2. Types of Functions in Python:
- Built-in Functions – Always available. Like `print()`, `len()`, `range()`.
- User-defined Functions – You create them with `def`.
- Lambda Functions – Small, anonymous functions.
- Recursive Functions – Functions that call themselves.
- Higher-order Functions – Accept other functions as arguments.
- Generator Functions – Use `yield` to return values one by one.

3. Ways to Use Functions in Code:

a. Direct Definition and Call
```
def greet(name):
    print(""Hello"", name)
greet(""Sam"")
```

b. With Return Value
```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
result = add(3, 4)
```

c. With Parameters: Functions accept inputs (called parameters), used like variables.

d. Lambda Function
```
double = lambda x: x * 2
print(double(5))
```

e. Function Inside a Module
```
import math
result = math.sqrt(16)
```

f. Passing Function as Argument
```
def shout(text):
    return text.upper()

def speak(action, words):
    print(action(words))

speak(shout, ""hello"")
```

g. Recursive Function
```
def countdown(n):
    if n == 0:
        print(""Done"")
    else:
        print(n)
        countdown(n - 1)
```

What Machine Understands:
When you define a function with def, Python stores it in memory as a callable object with a name.
- When you call it, Python creates a new memory scope, runs the body line by line, then clears it.
- Parameters become temporary variables inside that scope.
- If a module function is used, Python checks the module’s namespace, finds the function, and passes the arguments.

Summary:
- Functions are reusable action blocks. They live inside your own code or modules. You can create, call, pass, return, or even store them in variables.
- Understanding functions is like mastering the idea of “do something with this”—the heart of how coding thinks.

---

**Me**: *So if defining a variable makes it easier to call a piece of data, then defining a function makes it easier to call an action, right?*

**ChatGPT**: Yes, exactly. Variables simplify data retrieval by giving names to values. Functions, on the other hand, simplify performing actions or sets of instructions by giving them a callable name. Both make code cleaner, reusable, and more understandable—like naming steps in a recipe.

---

**Me**: *Write the most commonly used operators, explain each one with a real-life example, and provide a short code snippet demonstrating its usage.*

**ChatGPT**: 

1. Arithmetic Operators:

- + (Addition): Like adding prices of two items in a shopping cart.
```
total_price = 10 + 15
```

- - (Subtraction): Like calculating your change after paying.
```
change = 20 - 7
```

- * (Multiplication): Like calculating total cost of several cups of coffee.
```
cost = 3 * 5
```

- / (Division): Dividing a bill among friends.
```
share = 100 / 4
```

- // (Floor Division): Distributing 9 apples between 2 kids evenly (each gets 4).
```
apples_each = 9 // 2
```

- % (Modulus): Finding leftover eggs if packed in cartons of 3.
```
leftover = 10 % 3
```

- ** (Exponent): Calculating 2 to the power of 3.
```
power = 2 ** 3
```

2. Comparison Operators

- == (Equals): Checking if two names are the same.
```
is_same = name == ""Sam""
```

- != (Not equals): Checking if a password is wrong.
```
is_wrong = password != ""1234""
```

- > (Greater than): Checking if age is over 18.
```
is_adult = age > 18
```

- < (Less than): Checking if temperature is below 20.
```
is_cold = temp < 20
```

- >= (Greater or equal): Checking passing score.
```
passed = score >= 10
```

- <= (Less or equal): Checking price below limit.
```
cheap = price <= 50000
```

3. Logical Operators

- and: Both conditions true.
```
can_vote = (age >= 18) and (citizen == True)
```

- or: Either condition true.
```
open_shop = (day == ""Saturday"") or (day == ""Sunday"")
```

- not: Reverse condition.
```
is_closed = not open_shop
```

**Me**: *Now explain control structures like if, else, while, and other common ones in a very simple way, with an everyday example for each, and a short code snippet showing how to use them along with an explanation of the code.*

**ChatGPT**: Absolutely! Control structures are the decision-makers and repeaters in programming—they guide the flow of the program based on conditions or loops.

1. if / else – Decision making: 
- Everyday example: Imagine you want to decide whether to bring an umbrella based on the weather. “If it’s raining, bring umbrella; else, don’t.”
```
rain = True

if rain:
    print(""Bring umbrella"")
else:
    print(""No umbrella needed"")
```
Explanation:
- The program checks `if rain` is `True`.
- If yes, it prints “Bring umbrella”.
- Otherwise, it prints “No umbrella needed”.
- This is how you make decisions in code.

2. elif – Multiple decisions:
- Everyday example: Checking your mood to decide what to do: “If happy, smile; else if tired, rest; else work.”
```
mood = ""tired""

if mood == ""happy"":
    print(""Smile"")
elif mood == ""tired"":
    print(""Rest"")
else:
    print(""Work"")
```
Explanation:
- Checks the first condition; if false, goes to `elif`.
- If none match, goes to `else`.
- It helps you handle multiple cases.

3. while – Repetition until a condition changes:
- Everyday example: Eating pieces of a chocolate bar until it’s finished. “While there’s chocolate left, keep eating.”
```
pieces = 5

while pieces > 0:
    print(""Eat a piece"")
    pieces -= 1  # decrease pieces by 1

print(""No more chocolate"")
```
Explanation:
- As long as `pieces` is more than 0, it prints and decreases `pieces`.
- When `pieces` reaches 0, loop ends.
- This lets you repeat actions until a stop condition.

4. for – Repeating for each item in a sequence:
- Everyday example: Wishing happy birthday to every friend in your list.
```
friends = [""Ali"", ""Sara"", ""John""]

for friend in friends:
    print(""Happy birthday,"", friend)
```
Explanation:
- Goes through each friend in `friends` one by one.
- Prints a message for each.
- Useful for repeating actions for items in a list.

5. break – Exit loop early:
- Everyday example: Looking for your keys in drawers; stop searching once found.
```
drawers = [""empty"", ""empty"", ""keys"", ""empty""]

for drawer in drawers:
    if drawer == ""keys"":
        print(""Found keys!"")
        break
```
Explanation:
- Loops through drawers until it finds keys.
- Then stops immediately with `break`.
- Useful to exit loops when condition is met.

6. continue – Skip one loop iteration:
- Everyday example: Eating only apples from a mixed fruit basket; skip bananas.
```
fruits = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""apple"", ""orange""]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == ""banana"":
        continue
    print(""Eat"", fruit)
```
Explanation:
- When fruit is banana, skip printing.
- Otherwise, print eat message.
- `continue` skips the rest of current loop cycle.


7.Summary:
- if/else/elif: Choose which path to take.
- while: Repeat while condition holds.
- for: Repeat for each item.
- break: Stop loop early.

**Me**: *Now write a longer code that uses modules, but also write the code of the functions used in the main code after it, so we can see how the functions you used actually are and how they work. Finally, explain the entire code once, and then explain the module functions' code that comes after the main code.*

**ChatGPT**: Absolutely! I’ll create a Python program that uses some functions both directly defined inside the main code and some that come from a “module” (which I'll simulate here by writing their code after the main script for clarity).

The scenario:
- A simple inventory system for a bookstore that:
- Stores books with their titles and stock amounts
- Allows adding new books
- Allows selling books (which reduces stock)
- Shows current stock
- Checks if a book is in stock or not

1. Main Code:
```
# Main bookstore program

import bookstore_utils  # Our ""module"" with helper functions

inventory = {}

def main():
    while True:
        print(""\n1. Add Book\n2. Sell Book\n3. Show Inventory\n4. Check Stock\n5. Exit"")
        choice = input(""Choose an option: "")

        if choice == ""1"":
            title = input(""Book Title: "")
            amount = int(input(""Amount to add: ""))
            add_book(inventory, title, amount)
            print(f""Added {amount} copies of '{title}'."")
        elif choice == ""2"":
            title = input(""Book Title: "")
            amount = int(input(""Amount to sell: ""))
            if bookstore_utils.sell_book(inventory, title, amount):
                print(f""Sold {amount} copies of '{title}'."")
            else:
                print(f""Not enough stock to sell {amount} copies of '{title}'."")
        elif choice == ""3"":
            bookstore_utils.show_inventory(inventory)
        elif choice == ""4"":
            title = input(""Book Title: "")
            if bookstore_utils.is_in_stock(inventory, title):
                print(f""'{title}' is in stock."")
            else:
                print(f""'{title}' is out of stock."")
        elif choice == ""5"":
            print(""Goodbye!"")
            break
        else:
            print(""Invalid choice, try again."")

def add_book(inv, title, amount):
    """"""Add books to inventory, creating entry if missing.""""""
    if title in inv:
        inv[title] += amount
    else:
        inv[title] = amount

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    main()
```

2. ""Module"" code:
```
# bookstore_utils.py - helper functions for bookstore

def sell_book(inv, title, amount):
    """"""
    Attempt to sell books from inventory.
    Returns True if successful, False if not enough stock.
    """"""
    if title in inv and inv[title] >= amount:
        inv[title] -= amount
        return True
    else:
        return False

def show_inventory(inv):
    """"""Print all books and their amounts.""""""
    if not inv:
        print(""Inventory is empty."")
        return
    print(""Current inventory:"")
    for title, amount in inv.items():
        print(f"" - {title}: {amount} copies"")

def is_in_stock(inv, title):
    """"""Check if the book is available in stock.""""""
    return title in inv and inv[title] > 0
```

3. Explanation of the main code:

a. The program runs a continuous menu loop until user chooses to exit.
b. User can add books with a title and quantity using `add_book()`, a function inside the main code.
c. Selling books is done by calling `sell_book()` from the ""module"", which reduces stock if enough copies exist.
d. The current inventory can be displayed by calling `show_inventory()` from the module.
e. User can check if a specific book is available via `is_in_stock()`.
f. Input is accepted via `input()` and choices are handled with `if-elif-else`.

4. Explanation of the module functions:
- sell_book(inv, title, amount):
Checks if `title` exists and has enough stock. If yes, subtracts `amount` from stock and returns `True`. Otherwise, returns `False`.
- show_inventory(inv):
If inventory is empty, prints a message. Otherwise, iterates over all books and prints their titles and stock counts.
- is_in_stock(inv, title):
Returns `True` if the book is in the inventory and stock is more than zero. Otherwise, `False`.
- This structure shows how functions can be organized in a main program and supporting modules, making the code cleaner, reusable, and easier to maintain.

**Me**: Explain the control structures inside the main code you wrote in a simple conversational language, in the same order as they appear in the code.

**ChatGPT**: Sure! Here’s a simple, conversational explanation of the control structures in the main code, in order:

1. while True:
This creates a loop that never ends on its own. Think of it like a store that stays open all the time, ready to take orders. The program keeps running the menu again and again, waiting for your input, until you choose to close it (exit). So this loop keeps the whole program active.

2. print menu and input choice:
Inside the loop, the program shows you the list of options you can pick (add book, sell book, etc.). Then it waits for you to type your choice.

3. if choice == ""1"":
This checks if you picked option 1 (Add Book). If yes, it asks you for the book’s title and how many copies you want to add. Then it calls the function add_book to add those books into the inventory.

4. elif choice == ""2"":
If you didn’t pick 1, it checks if you picked 2 (Sell Book). It asks for the title and amount to sell. Then it calls sell_book function from the module to try to sell those copies. If successful, it confirms sale; otherwise it warns you about insufficient stock.

5. elif choice == ""3"":
If you didn’t pick 1 or 2, it checks if you picked 3 (Show Inventory). It calls the module function to print all books and their quantities.

6. elif choice == ""4"":
If you picked 4 (Check Stock), it asks for a title, then checks with the module function if the book is in stock, and tells you yes or no.

7. elif choice == ""5"":
If you pick 5, the program says goodbye and uses break to stop the while loop, ending the program.

8. else:
If you type anything else that isn’t 1-5, it tells you the choice is invalid and the loop starts again, showing the menu.

1m3dctl,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m3dctl/help_me_make_a_baby/,"""HELP ME MAKE A BABY""","The following story, recounting one Detective Karras’ experience working the unsolved Bergman case, was posted on a - now defunct - anonymous internet board in 2012. The post was prompted by forum user __notyocheese__, who asked:

“Any cops or detectives on here have any crazy stories / cases they would be open to talking about? I (16M) am thinking about a career in law enforcement and want to know what I'm getting into. Thanks (:”

Replies to this post were mostly unremarkable, many noting that the amount of paperwork, the working hours, and being forced to engage with the criminal underbelly of communities they otherwise would feel safe living in turned most rookies away from long term employment. Some offered more optimistic perspectives, encouraging the initial poster to pursue it if they felt called to. These posts were often accompanied by personal accounts of exciting or satisfying moments in their careers. Detective Karras, writing under the username f_karras posted the following:

f_karras:

“ok kid. I have one for you. In 1998 I was a homicide Detective in a smaller east coast city. It was a college town. Lots of students, lots of people staying temporarily, and because of this, despite a relatively small total population, we had a lot to keep track of. It was mostly drugs stuff, to be fair, but we stayed busy. It was summer and most of the kids had gone home for vacation. School was out but there was always a sizable chunk of the student body that stayed in town and pretended they lived there, and usually we didn't have to bother with them too much. More overdoses than murders typically, so things had been pretty slow. I came into work one morning, I think it was a Thursday, and my supervisor is rushing me out the door before I can even get to my chair. I still remember he said “Karras, you need to get down to 5th and Evans right fucking now!” He was a good Ole boy from the area, talked real slow most of the time and never forgot the manners his granny taught him, so I knew when I heard him barking and swearin that things were serious. Obviously I asked him what was up, but he didn't give me much. He said two beat officers responded to a call at some student living about 20 minutes prior. One kid came back early from his vacation, found his roommate with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. That made the rush even more confusing, but the only thing else I managed to get out of him before he practically shoved me out the door was “Frank, you know I ain't liable to bullshit ya. The boys down called in for backup and… well they ain't making any sense. I think it's their first body. I can't get a straight story and I know you have all your ducks in a row. Go on and get out there and write me a report that don't sound crazy.” Again, this only made me more confused, but I was at the steps of the police station at this point and I figured that the quickest way of making it make sense was only a 10 minute drive downtown.

Look, I never thought I would tell this to anyone, much less make it so public. At this point I gotta ask, what am I allowed to write up here? I don't wanna put anything up here that ain't supposed to be up here and I don't want to upset anyone. Let me know and I'll keep going. 
FK”

The post immediately sparked interest, and a forum moderator responded within the hour.

dkracerfan_MOD:

“as long as you don't include any inappropriate images you should be in the clear. SA and child SA are touchy tho even without pics”

Detective Karras, apparently not understanding, posted a response to the moderator:

f_karras:

“I don't know what that is. Kid was about 19 if I remember right.”

After clarification, he resumed

f_karras:

“Jesus I told you guys I was homicide right? We ain't going anywhere like that so don't worry, though I don't know how much better off we are. OK so I drive downtown and meet with these rookies. I think one was named Smith but I don't remember what the other fella was called. They both are standing outside this apartment, Smith has the guy that called sat against the wall a ways from the door. Poor kid was shaking, Smith wasn't fairing much better, but he was holding himself together enough to get a statement. I remember going over his notes later on was hard because he couldn't keep his hand still enough to write clearly. The other fella greeted me, which makes me feel bad for not remembering his name. He was standing by the front door to the apartment, halfway keeping the crime scene secure and halfway holding a handkerchief up to his face. I don't know if it was to block the smell or to keep from throwing up. I kept a little bottle of scented hand sanitizer in my jacket for these types of calls, when the body has sat there for a few days. After we greeted each other I pulled a rag out of my pocket, with the bottle, poured some in it, folded it, and held it over my mouth. The rookie looked like he just watched me discover fire, and I handed the bottle to him after he opened the door for me. He didn't say much. When you've worked in this field for as long as I have, you start to get desensitized to certain things, a fact I was reminded of by the puddle of vomit I had to step over as I entered the apartment. The smell of decay was inescapable, and the further into the apartment I walked the less effective the rag held over my mouth and nose became, but I had dealt with far worse over the course of my career, and, by the depth and potentancy of this particular odor, I guessed that whatever body I was going to find was only a week or two old. I scanned the cramped living room of the apartment and was unable to find the actual source of this smell, so I called out to the rookie by the door.
“Where the hell is it man? I don't wanna spend any more time in here than I have to.”
The rookie, sheepishly and with a wavering half-hearted attempt to project his voice enough that he wouldn't have to uncover his face, responded, “Bathroom… on the left down the hall.”
I remember wanting to deck both of these kids. Or at least call them both pussies back at the station, but I’m glad I held my tongue. 
Listen kid, I know that this is long winded, and part of that is because I really don't want to talk about the next few moments of that morning, and part of it is to show how jarring this shit can be. You never know what you’re going to walk into, or if you’ll get to eat breakfast and have a cup of coffee before God shows you the worst things his creations can do to each other. I’ve seen parents beat to death by their own kids, kids beat to death by their own parents, gunshot wounds and stab wounds in places below the belt I don't particularly want to describe, one time we found an elderly woman’s right hand and left foot in a abandoned K-Mart parking lot (and that was all we ever found), and I’ve seen people kill themselves in every way you could imagine, and some ways that you definitely couldn't. I’ve seen a lot of fucked up shit, and it makes it hard to have any love for humanity. I’ve put bankers and fry-cooks on trial for the same offences, I’ve put people, men and women, of every race and age behind bars, all for the same primordial crime first committed by Cain against his brother. In the however thousands or millions of years in between then and now, we have changed a lot, but one thing that hasn't changed is our capacity for evil and violence against our brothers and sisters. It goes beyond anything I can make sense of, and if there is a God and a hell, if the sins of our forefathers so offended him that he felt the need to wipe the earth clean and start over, then, firstly, I can’t hold it against him, and secondly, I think he ought to do it again. Is this what you want to get into, kid? For the rest of your life? 
Enough stalling. 

The first thing that came into view as I approached the bathroom was the shattered mirror. It had been shot once, the bullet made contact a few inches above the sink, as if the gun had been fired from the hip rather than from eye level, a fact I momentarily considered strange. People shoot mirrors more often than you would think. I’m no psychologist, though I figure it has something to do with a low self-worth, dissatisfaction with your appearance, or both. Regardless of why people do it, they always, without fail, aim the gun at the reflection of their face. I am stalling again. The next thing I noticed was a stool. Then a foot. The body was apparently slumped against the wall opposite the mirror and just outside of my view. I continued, steeling myself for what came next. When the rest of the leg came into view I knew something was wrong. The foot was undoubtedly that of a full grown man. Well, a teenager, technically. The leg was the diameter of an adult’s as well, but the length was all wrong. It was too short, the proportions didn't make sense. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, so I nutted up and rounded the corner. What came into view was strange, to say the least, and a rookie cop being unable to coherently articulate what was lying dead in that bathroom over the phone began to make a lot more sense. I also had trouble describing what I saw the first few times I had to, but practice makes perfect. At first, I thought I was looking at a dwarf suicide, which would have been rare and strange but also wouldnt have been a first for me, but again, the proportions of the libs to the body and the head didnt make any sense. Ok, well, what was left of the head. Shotguns are messy. It, I took to calling it an it because the thought of someone doing that to a real person still bothers me, had on a child’s hospital gown and its back against the wall, so the only exposed body parts other than the head and neck were the forearms and hands, and the calves and feet. Both were abnormally short, with a suture at the middle around the diameter of the limb. I couldn't make sense of it. Further inspection of the body revealed that, along with also being abnormally short, the same stitched up wound could be found on both arms two inches above the elbow, and on both legs three inches above the knee. In examining the legs, it became clear that the victim was also wearing a soiled adult diaper. I became slowly convinced, against the hope I still had in my heart that what I was looking at wasn’t real and I would soon wake up in a cold sweat in the relative safety of my own apartment, that the stitched up wounds located in the middle of each body part were the, now healed, fleshy memories of complete amputation, that whoever did this had severed each limb an inch or two beyond the joints connecting it to the torso, then further amputated each below the knees and elbows, cut the resultant pieces to some desirous shorter length, then meticulously surgically reattached them to the torso. The mangled mass of flesh and bone that the shotgun blast left behind, unambiguously self inflicted despite the other, clearly non-self inflicted wounds, concealed another morbid puzzle piece that, at the time, struck me as just another sadistic torture inflicted onto the body - all of the victim’s teeth had been removed. The surgical alteration of the limbs, while barbaric, must have been done with enough professionalism to shorten them without rendering them completely useless, but the scarring on the gums of the lower jaw (not much was left of the upper jaw) implied the use of less refined methods of extraction. I guessed at the time that pliers had been used for this task, and the coroner, after the body was autopsied, while unable to determine with absolute certainty, generally agreed. The coroner also informed us that the victim, despite being an adult male, was completely hairless. Chemical analysis showed that, rather than being shaved clean, some sort of topical hair removal cream had been used. No other particularly notable bodily abortions were found. Based on X-ray analysis of the skeleton, the coroner confirmed my initial horrific assumption about how the limbs had been mutilated, and the estimated time of death was about 5 days prior to its discovery. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here, because, though horrific, the state of the body didn’t tell us much about who had actually done this. After my initial inspection, I notified the station chief and had paramedics sent to the site to bag and tag the body, along with a few other investigators to help search the apartment and interview relevant relations. There turned out to be shockingly few, most of the neighboring apartments were empty for the summer and, coinciding with the statement given to us by the roommate who placed the initial call, the victim didn’t have much of a social life. Record shows that it had been a ward of the state for most of its life, it’s parents died, one of drug overdose and one of suicide, when it was a toddler, so we had no relevant familial relations. The roommate himself didn't know much about him and only told us that the victim was a shut-in for the one semester that they lived together, and that he thought that the victim must have been paying for both school and housing with some kind of federal financial aid. The school’s financial office confirmed that this was true, and no record of current or prior employment could be located. In the absence of relevant witnesses, we were left with only the material evidence that we were able to find at the apartment. Hallway security camera footage from the assumed time of death didn’t show anyone entering or exiting the apartment, but tapes from two nights prior gave us our first real hit. The tapes showed a man with a duffle bag enter the apartment in the middle of the night, and leave 30 minutes later empty handed. Outside camera footage showed that he drove a black Ford sedan, but the licence plate had either been removed or covered so that didn't help us much. Skimming through the tapes of the nights prior to this didn't turn up anything for a while, until we found what we assumed was the last video footage of the victim alive on a tape from about a month prior to the discovery of the body, a few days after the roommate, and most of the other students living in the complex, left for summer vacation. The tape showed the victim, unmutilated, leave his apartment, hop on the bike that the roommate informed us was the victim’s primary mode of transportation, and head off towards the more impoverished portion of the downtown area. We tracked his movement by consulting with local businesses that operated in the area we assumed he was moving through, but only a handful of them had any outdoor security cameras, and, of the ones that did, even fewer kept tapes for longer than a week. We swiftly realized that there was practically no way of knowing where he was going, and sweeps of the general area failed to turn up the bike, which was the main thing we were looking for, or any other meaningful evidence. Questioning people that had similar vehicles to the one driven by the assumed perpetrator and the last person, other than the victim, to be in the apartment prior to the initial 911 call similarly turned up nothing, and after a while we were forced to give up. I thought that was the end of it, some nobody got cut up and disfigured by some other nobody, then shot himself in the head. But it wasn't.

A month after I filed the case away and moved on to other, less horrifically mysterious cases, a package turned up on my desk. Without opening it, it was clear it was a video tape, but I was reluctant to look inside because the brown paper that it came wrapped in had no return address, no post mark, and wasn't addressed to me specifically. Instead of my name, the black marker on the outside of the paper simply read “to homicide”. This being incredibly strange, I asked the front desk clerk that I assumed delivered it to my desk where it came from, and she told me that a man in a black hoodie and sunglasses pulled up to the door of the station on a bike a few minutes prior to my own arrival, walked through the front door, gave her the package, walked out, and then, instead of biking away, began walking towards the lower downtown area. A feeling of ambiguous dread washed over me, and I returned to my desk to open the package. I should have put the pieces together faster, if I had I could have had officers sweeping the streets a mere half an hour after the hooded individuals departure, but time and my work on other cases slowed my ability to understand and to act accordingly. I opened the package at my desk, and sure enough, I found a tape marked “TRIAL ONE”, and a folded up scrap of a local newspaper. One side of the paper had, written in the same black marker, the words “the next try will be better”, and the otherside had a portion of the help wanted column that runs in the back of most papers. The date printed on the top right corner of the paper was near the middle of June, just before the university's most recent summer vacation period, and a few days before the mutilated victim left it’s apartment for the last time. A submission to the help wanted column was circled. It was only one sentence and a phone number. The sentence read “HELP ME MAKE A BABY”. 

The bike outside of the station was confirmed by the roommate of the victim to be the same one the victim was last seen riding. The phone number was for a payphone on an innocuous side street downtown. The contents of the tape, without getting into too much detail, showed the victim after his mutilation, but prior to his death. The building the victim was filmed in was unidentifiable. The perpetrator of the mutilation was never in-front of the camera, and never spoke. The victim, clothed in an ill-fitting toddler pajama set, likewise never “spoke”, the only sounds coming from the tape being muffled sobs from the victim as he lay writhing in a 4ft by 4ft pack and play, surrounded by baby toys, while a single note rendition of “The Itsy Bitsy Spider” could be heard emanating from somewhere out of frame. 
We never found a suspect. I resigned a few months after I was forced to close the case yet again. 

I assume this monster is still out there. I hope he hasn't taken any more victims, but I feel certain he has.

My advice to you, kid, is that you find a more wholesome occupation.""

## Key Features Analysis

The best men's soaps are characterized by their carefully curated ingredients, effectiveness, and suitability for various skin types. Understanding these features is crucial in selecting a soap that not onyl cleanses but also enhances your skin's health.

**Natural and Organic Ingredients:**

Men's soaps boasting natural and organic ingredients are becoming increasingly popular due to their gentler impact on the skin.These soaps often incorporate plant-based oils like coconut oil, olive oil, and shea butter, which are known for their moisturizing and nourishing properties. Moreover, they typically avoid harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulfates, and artificial fragrances, reducing the risk of irritation and allergic reactions, making them ideal for men with sensitive skin. Natural ingredients provide a more holistic cleansing experience.

**Exfoliating Properties:**

Many men's soaps include exfoliating agents to remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Ingredients like oatmeal,sea salt,and coffee grounds act as natural abrasives,promoting smoother and brighter skin. Regular exfoliation prevents ingrown hairs, a common concern after shaving, and helps to improve skin texture. These exfoliating soaps are especially beneficial for men who work outdoors or engage in activities that expose their skin to dirt and grime.

**Moisturizing Capabilities:**

Maintaining skin hydration is crucial,and many men's soaps are formulated with moisturizing ingredients to combat dryness. Look for soaps containing glycerin,aloe vera,or hyaluronic acid,which are humectants that attract moisture to the skin. These soaps help to prevent the tight, itchy feeling that can occur after cleansing, ensuring your skin remains supple and pleasant throughout the day. Using a moisturizing soap is essential,especially in colder climates or for individuals with dry or normal skin.

**Aroma and Scent Profile:**

The scent of a men's soap plays a meaningful role in the overall showering experience. Soaps with natural essential oils like peppermint, cedarwood, and eucalyptus offer invigorating and masculine fragrances. Some soaps also feature complex scent blends inspired by colognes, adding a touch of sophistication to your daily routine. The choice of scent is highly personal, but opting for natural fragrances can minimize the risk of skin irritation and provide a more pleasant sensory experience.

**Antibacterial and Antifungal Properties:**

For men who lead active lifestyles or are prone to body odor, soaps with antibacterial and antifungal properties can be especially beneficial. Ingredients like tea tree oil and charcoal are known for their antimicrobial qualities, helping to combat bacteria and fungi that can cause body odor and skin infections.

## FAQs Section

navigating the world of men's soap can raise several questions. Here are some common inquiries and their answers to help you make a more informed decision.

**What type of soap is best for sensitive skin?**
soaps with natural and organic ingredients, free from harsh chemicals like sulfates, parabens, and artificial fragrances, are generally best for sensitive skin. Look for hypoallergenic and dermatologist-tested options to minimize the risk of irritation. Soaps containing calming ingredients like chamomile or aloe vera can also be beneficial.

**How frequently enough should I exfoliate my skin with soap?**
Exfoliating your skin 2-3 times per week is generally sufficient for most men. Over-exfoliating can strip away your skin's natural oils and lead to dryness and irritation. Adjust the frequency based on your skin type and sensitivity. Men with oily skin may tolerate more frequent exfoliation, while those with dry or sensitive skin may need to exfoliate less frequently enough.

**can men's soap be used on the face?**
While some men's soaps are formulated for both body and face, it is generally best to use a dedicated facial cleanser. Facial skin is often more delicate than the skin on the body, and harsh soaps can strip away its natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation. If you choose to use men's soap on your face, opt for one with gentle and moisturizing ingredients.

**How do I choose the right scent for my soap?**
The right scent is a matter of personal preference. Consider your lifestyle and the types of fragrances you typically enjoy. Soaps with natural essential oils offer a more subtle and sophisticated scent, while those with synthetic fragrances might potentially be more intense and long-lasting. If you have sensitive skin, opt for unscented or lightly scented soaps to minimize the risk of irritation.

1m3d6x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1m3d6x8/any_advice_on_situation_below/,Any advice on situation below?,"Hey everyone I need help figuring out the situation I was in with this one girl and I really need help on how to move. To start off, I know in this story I was in the wrong for many things and that my bad communication styles helped lead to a lot of this, but I don’t know if that warrants everything I feel like I went through. I feel like both people in the story were in the wrong at the end of the day and were both extremely hurt. It is a pretty long and winding story, but I would appreciate any help on if I was dealing with emotional abuse, narcissism, or if I just helped cause it all. I thank you in advance. 

Backstory: Me and this girl met approximately 3 years working an internship together. We became really good friends within this timespan and you could definitely tell there were sparks between us but it never really led to anything. This is due to me dealing with a then failing long term relationship and her getting in a relationship with one of our other coworkers. In November of 2022 we were both intoxicated and ended up making out at a party together. I know we both heavily regret this as she was still in the same relationship at the time, however, that boyfriend was also very mean to her. In the next few months she broke up with him and I ended up getting into a new relationship. 

We would still text each other from time to time and hang out when we would see each other on our college campus at coffee shops but nothing intimate happened until November of 2023. My girlfriend at the time had just broken up with me a month prior, and until February 2024 I was in a pretty brutal on and off with that girlfriend until we totally cut things off. Me and the same girl then started doing intimate things off and on but we never talked about advancing our relationship on. In summer of 2024 I went off to start my full time and she still had another year of university left. During that summer she was talking to another guy that ultimately ended and we started talking again romantically in September of 2024.

Total Situation Part 1: I am going to try and summarize everything somewhat concisely, but there was so much that happened that I really don’t know how it will go. During the summer of 2024 I moved to start my full time job in a city around 2.5 hours away from where we both went to university. We started texting everyday, saying good morning and good night, having calls with each other, and things were relatively good. I would go and visit her back in our university town around every 3 weeks. Finally, in November she said that she doesn’t want anything casual and wants it to be serious. Here is my major fuck up of the story. I said I wanted it to be exclusive as well, but I never officially asked her out to be my girlfriend. Truthfully, I was pretty anxious as I knew after she graduated she would be moving 6 hours away, and my last relationship ended due to distance. The thing is, I did not express all these worries to her, as I was too anxious and afraid to have seriously tough conversations as I was afraid that it would end the good thing we had. That was a really bad mistake on my part, and it was my responsibility to do so and unfair to both of us that I didn’t. All I said was I wanted to be exclusive because I really liked her but I never went deeper into my worries of a possible relationship. I also think it is important to state that neither of us saw anybody else within this time span. After that talk in November we continued with things being business as usual and acted like boyfriend and girlfriend without really being ""official"". This is when all the cracks started forming in the foundation of our relationship and I feel very guilty about causing them and the heartbreak both of us went through. 

Total Situation Part 2: Things continued normally in the unofficial fashion we were in, except after every single time we would hang out she would go completely silent with me for a day or two after. I would always ask her what led to this and it would always be the same answer of me refusing to talk about the important things. Which again I admit was true, and honestly by this time I felt so sick trying to talk about it because I knew at this point I had screwed up so badly. Things would be perfect when we were together but when it came to communicating over the phone it was so bad. After these few hangouts happened of us being together and then her pulling away immediately when I left, the situation intensified tenfold in February. I was driving home after spending the weekend at home (which was 4 hours away) and I stopped by to see her for a little bit. She came outside and she was slightly intoxicated that time and she told me that she loved me. I honestly just turned silent because I did not know what to say back, I had never had someone say that to me while we were not dating, I felt trapped in my own car. After me being shocked about this and telling her I did not really know what to say back, she angrily left my car and I drove back to my place of work. 

Total Situation Part 3: She hardly ever visited me in the city I currently live in as it was 2.5 hours from our university city and because she always pinned her not being able to visit on having a dog. This was fine I reckon for the most part but it did truthfully irk me a little bit. One of the times she did come and visit me was in late February, and this was when I grew some sort of balls and I asked her out to be officially boyfriend and girlfriend. She denied me however as she claimed she did not trust me and my actions and that I always fail to have the conversations that matter. After this, this is when I think our difference in communication styles started to differ. It would be okay for her to be short or even not respond to me for 2-3 days because “I had never treated her right” or because of her having a bad day. However, if it took me more than an hour to respond I would be in the wrong and it would prove I didn’t love her. At this point in March we both started saying I love you to each other. I know it sounds really crazy, and maybe I should not have done that, but I did love her at that time and truthfully I still do after everything that unfolded. But her communication style from here on out would follow the same that I listed above of her being able to cold shoulder me whenever she wanted but I had to respond asap. It really caused a lot of anxiety for me for the following months as I always had to be the one to send goodmorning and goodnight and to respond fast and if I didn’t then I knew she would be short with me or not talk to me for a day or two because “I did not care for her enough and never have” so I constantly found myself apologizing for being a bad communicator even though she could choose when she wanted to be a bad or a good one

Total Situation Part 4: This same communication between us continued and got significantly worse in the following months. Mid March was her birthday and I got her a birthday present and celebrated with her. In late March she started pulling away from me completely because I had not asked her out again to become official together. I felt like I was losing her completely so I DMed one of her friends to help me on what to do. This was another giant mistake on my end as she found out immediately and made me write out an apology to her friend and block her and I honestly think it completely shattered trust between us. She suggested we take a week break and I think about what I can do to make the relationship work. That is what we did and I came with suggestions of us both being better constant communicators and making sure to call each other more and keep each other in the loop of what we were doing. She then said that she was mad at me for not breaking the no communication week earlier and it proved that I didn’t love her at all because if I did then I would have broken it after a day. After this point is where I really feel I was under some form of emotional abuse or narcissism. 

Total Situation Part 5: We went through this vicious cycle for the next 3 months of feeling like the other did not communicate enough and I would be yelled at for forgetting to send 1 good night text or for not telling her exactly what I was doing or who I was with. Some instances of this were me being at a work dinner and forgetting to tell her and then her accusing me of being at dinner with another woman. That became a very constant theme for the last 4 months of our “relationship” to where I would be accused of seeing other women behind her back. She would also constantly tell me that she felt like a second option to me and that I was clearly interested in other people, when this was not the case whatsoever. It felt like whatever I said from this point forward could not convince her I loved her, I cared about her, or anything of the sort. So I would just end up apologizing for never making her feel special and became very emotionally taxing on me and still is to this day as it felt that anything I did was never good enough for her. I attempted to ask her out again in April and was met with the same response of not being able to be trusted and that I had not shown her I cared for her despite asking about her day everyday, getting gifts, and trying to make sure she was okay during rough times. To be fair she was going through rough times with school, job search, and graduation, and she always hit me with “I needed someone to help me, I didn't need you but I just needed someone to support me and you couldn't be that” so I just always felt useless.

Total Situation 5: For the months of May and June is where things really hit a boiling point. In the beginning of May she Facetimed me after a night out where she tore into me saying that I treated her like shit when I was dating other people and accused me again of seeing other people. Examples she used of treating her like shit is that she would have been there for me at a drop of a hat but I was not there for her, even though we hung out together and still talked when I was in my previous relationship I told her this really hurt my feelings and she said “I apologize for hurting your feelings but I am not going to say sorry for everything I said”. Every single apology I gave for “treating her like shit” she said that she said she has forgiven me, but she still kept bringing it up for the next month. After this, she graduated from our university and I got her a handwritten letter of how proud I was of her and a present, but she did not talk to me her entire graduation day. I asked her about this and she said it is because I would have just made her upset on graduation day. At this point, I really think she just hated me even though she kept saying I am one of the greatest people she knows. After this, she went on a post graduation trip abroad with her family and she suggested we don’t talk. I told her I still wanted to be with her (I had asked her out 3 times before this that were all hit with a no because she did not trust me). We kept talking during her trip, however due to the time difference, our bad communication styles, and our general anger with each other at this point, it just turned into a shit throwing contest. Things would be fine, and sweet and lovey dovey, but if one thing was said that set one person off it just went to a world of shit where we were both mean to each other. At this point I think both of us were hurt, however when I brought up things that hurt me she would always turn it on its head and tell me she is acting in a mean way because something I did caused it. It felt like she would never take responsibility or apologize for hurting me even though she said I was the one who could never take accountability. 

Total Situation 6: While she was still abroad we were texting on a normal Saturday and she questioned again if I actually loved her. At this time, she had stopped saying because she didn't believe I loved her back. We ended up talking about certain things and I was telling her about how I was struggling a little bit emotionally outside of our relationship due to my grandma being in the hospital. Her response to this was breaking things off with me because I did not keep her in the loop like I told her I would. I tried to fight her on this and apologized for not keeping her in the loop on things. She said no, and then proceeded to say how she wished that I had fought for our relationship more even though she had just given up on it. A few days passed and we started talking again and it was relatively normal until Memorial Day. During Memorial Day she just asked me to end things completely because I was torturing her mentally and she could not take it anymore. I then proceeded to do as she asked because she sounded like she was in so much pain and I felt like I could not do anything to stop it. Her response to this was “WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BREAK THINGS OFF I WANTED FUCK YOU” and she threated to block me on everything and accused me of never caring for her at and for dragging her along for an entire year. 

Total Situation 7: At this point, I was in our university city for Memorial Day, and I convinced her to meet up to try and hash things out. We met up at her place and did some relationship things and then got into that conversation. It was the same old thing that she could not trust me at all and that I had dragged her along, and at this point she told me we were nothing and that she did not want to talk to me again. I left her house to go back to my friends and she stopped sharing her location with me. An hour after this she texted me how she felt awful and one thing led to another and I ended up spending the night at her place and she apologized for everything and shared her location with me again and it was like things were perfectly back to normal for one more night. This was also the last night I knew I would be able to see her for a long time as she was moving to her new work city about 6 hours away. We then ended up in the same old tired loop for another week. Me not communicating enough or caring enough, and her pulling away from me. Honestly, I think we both knew it was over at this point. We had broken up 3 times in the span of two weeks and I think we were both just so tired and disillusioned, and that it would be difficult to see each other regardless because of her moving. 

Total Situation 8: We had another giant argument in the second weekend of June that ended things for good. It started with her citing me not saying goodnight for two nights and it turned into another shit throwing contest. She told me how I never gave her an opportunity to speak, and when I asked her to tell her side of how she wanted to continue things she stopped sharing her location permanently and removed me off her private snapchat story. We have not talked since, but we are not blocked on any phone numbers or socials or anything like that. After all that I still do miss her, and I wish things would have turned out a lot differently and that I did things differently. I am not talking to anybody right now and I am just attempting to focus on my mental health, my friends and family, and my career. I have been pretty depressed about how everything unfolded for the past month, but my anxiety has also lowered heavily and I know it was directly caused by that relationship. 

Prologue and Questions: So really I just don’t know what to do at this point. I know I miss her, should I try and rekindle things and completely restart? I feel like I will just end up in the same situation with the same person. Was I dealing with a sort of emotional abuse or did I cause it all or was it a mix of both? Has anyone dealt with a situation similar and how did you move on from it? All comments and advice on how to not end up in a situation like this and how to take care of myself are greatly appreciated. Thank you to all who chime in and read.

While making a template for a coffee filter holder (for pour over coffee), I was browsing online for inspiration and noticed ceramic filters that the coffee actually goes through.

I saw some porcelain filters made in Hanami, Nagasaki Japan specifically, but I can't find much more info.

Is this something I could make myself, and if so do I need to use a specific type of clay, or firing temperature? I would imagine lower temp = increased porosity, but the clays bags I've checked only state the porosity/water absorption at max firing temp, and the highest % are with grog.

But the beans i got! 
I'm trying not to be harsh but it was worse than Nescafe classic, even after all the time and energy invested in brewing it, I still have it and i don't know what to do. 
It doesn't even smell good it smells so burnt and not so pleasing, usually even the worst coffees will atleast smell good not with this. 

I thought maybe the problem is with my pack but this year the quality of beans have gone down drastically, I've seen several posts saying they messed up the roasting of the beans whatever it maybe those 500gms of beans became a nightmare for me. 

I warn the people of this community DO NOT BUY! Aranya Gold atleast. 
I don't know about others but this one is definitely not the one you want. 
On the other hand you like the burnt coffees this would be a hot-deal for you.

I'm male, uk, courteous, divorced for several years, feel like I've been single a decade, certainly no intimacy for almost a decade, reasonable job, average house. I get to see my kid a few days each week which I love. Otherwise, live on my own. 

I haven't used OLD since I was in my early 20s, which at that time was only pof. I've been single long enough now I suppose, though as somewhat an introvert, I've been happy enough with a close longterm friend, child when he visits, and my parents I see fairly often. 

As such, I'm not sure if I'm after FWB, or LTR. I'd prefer to just see how things go, I suppose. However I know I'd prefer meeting rather than endless vague texting. And will probably be pretty fussy in my search filters, and try to write meaningful opening msgs.

With that in mind, some initial questions...

1. Where do I start in terms of which service to use in 2025? Tinder? And do you put FWB or LTR somewhere? What if I'm not sure which, or I put the wrong one, which cancels out potential matches? Or if I change my mind after a bit and want to focus on one rather than the other? People might recognise my profile and maybe think I'm not serious if I've swapped around my intentions somepoint.

2. ls an initial video or voice call something people go for? Or is that seen as a bit cold? (for want of a better word). And if it's OK, where would a video call be suggested, in the profile? Or when chatting? 

3. For a first date, I live near a beach (always people around) and like going for walks. Would that be off-putting? Or does it often have to be a coffee shop? (my job is sedentary as it is, I don't ideally want more sitting/eating/drinking). Would mostly love the idea of just meeting up for a walk, less intense I think.

4. if I made a simple intro video about myself, and sent it to anyone who seemed interested in me, how might that be received? Just thinking, it could cut down on some wasted dates if they didn't like me in that form, or encourage others who thought yeah - that's more dimensional than a mugshot and text. Or if too weird, forget that idea.

I am visiting NYC soon, and going to take a day or half-a-day riding bike around the city, starting from Central Park, riding down to Wall Street through Broadway, and then riding along the river to return back to Central Park.

  
I have two questions I would like to ask:

  
1. Is my route realistic in terms of accessible bike lanes & safety, and have any tips on places I might be missing out on seeing?

so i connected with a guy on Bumble. we exchange a few short notes once connected and it turns out we live in the same neighborhood and likely very close, as he walks his dog at a park that is literally outside my window. he says ""we should meet for coffee sometime!"" to which i reply ""sounds great!"". then...nothing. a couple weeks go by and i think i walk past him at the park. i msg him to confirm it was him (it was!) and he asks, 'how are you?' so i tell him i've been abroad, just got back. he asks where i went, has some followup questions, then....goes silent. 

another week goes by and i'm about to msg him ""care to have coffee someday?"" i know, i know, he's not interested, not a great communicator, blah blah blah...but tbh i think it would be cool just to have a neighborhood friend maybe to go on a walk with now and then or whatever. he's a shrink btw and seems like a genuinely nice guy.

so my question is not ""do you think i should msg him"" (bc i am going to do so regardless and i will be happy to update this thread on how that turns out, if interested)...it's more just to ask what do others make of this scenario? thx!",1,1752870504.0,OnlineDating,7,1.0,False

there were several times where i heard my name being called by a man’s voice in the restaurant but usually it was j a soft like whisper in my ear or very faint. this usually happened on on night shift, while everyone would be outside on smk break. 

one night i actually saw him. i have never been diagnosed with any typer of disorder that involves auditory or visual hallucinations. but i swear i have never been so sure of seeing something in my life. i saw him when it was almost a full restaurant and i saw him out if the corner of my eye but anytime id look directly at him he was gone. i was standing at the register cashing people out when i see there is a man in a red, navy, and black plaid shirt with crumpled blue jeans on. when i looked up he disappeared. as soon as i looked out of the corner of my eye he was there. 

i honestly wasnt sure what to think at this point but i was definitely questioning what i had seen. i brushed it off and a few days later i was working a morning shift and i was standing my the coffee maker talking w my coworker, when a bag of coffee grounds was thrown off the top shelf and bounced on the floor. my coworker turns to me and i kid you not says “thats toby saying hi to you”. i asked her who is toby? and she said “you havent heard abt toby?” i said no and she proceeds to tell me toby was a regular at the waffle house. he was a lonely older gentleman who would come and hangout in there and he had passed away within the past few months. 

i dont know if that waffle house legitimately has a ghost named toby or if they were j messing with me by saying that. mind you i had never brought up my spiritual beliefs to coworkers. ",6,1752870473.0,Paranormal,4,1.0,False

1m3cxkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1m3cxkz/should_you_consider_the_electrolux_compact_front/,Should You Consider the Electrolux Compact Front Load Washer?,"The Electrolux ELFW4222AW is a compact front-load washer I recently had the pleasure of putting through its paces. With its sleek design and promise of advanced cleaning technology, I was initially curious about how this small yet capable unit would fare during day-to-day tasks in my bustling household. As a professional reviewer who frequently tests home appliances, I’m always seeking a washer that balances efficiency, quiet operation, and user-friendly features. This one certainly caught my attention.

**Design and Build Quality**

This washer’s minimalist, modern design immediately stood out. With dimensions of 25 x 23.6 x 33.5 inches, it easily slots into tight laundry spaces, making it ideal for apartments or smaller homes. Its white finish provides a clean, classic appearance that blends seamlessly with most interiors. The control console consists of push buttons that appear well organized, and the overall build quality feels solid—certainly built to last. The reversible door is a thoughtful touch, offering flexibility for installation in varying layouts. It’s clear that attention was paid to both aesthetics and practicality.

**Performance and Features**

The inclusion of the LuxCare Wash System genuinely sets this washer apart. I tested several types of clothing and fabrics—everything from delicate silks to heavy-duty towels—and the results were consistent. The washer manages to clean thoroughly, thanks to its precise temperature control, appropriate wash actions, and helpful steam options. With a maximum spin speed of 1400 RPM, I noticed clothes came out almost dry, cutting down drying time significantly. 

This washer also introduces Perfect Steam Technology, which effortlessly lifts dirt and stains. I ran a few items with stubborn coffee stains, and it handled the task better than I had expected. The Steam Refresh cycle, while not essential for every wash, truly impressed me for quick wrinkle removing and refreshing clothes that had been sitting in the wardrobe too long.

**Check [Electrolux ELFW4222AW](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bsnx5gr9/) price on Amazon.**

**Energy Efficiency and Operation**

Energy efficiency has become a key consideration for me when reviewing appliances, and this unit delivered. As an Energy Star-certified washer, it’s designed to reduce water and electricity consumption. I monitored its operation closely during the testing phase and found it both quiet and efficient—a particularly important factor in homes where the laundry room isn’t isolated.

The fully automatic mode streamlines use, making it simple for anyone in the household to operate without needing to consult the manual repeatedly. Pair that with the child safety lock, and it’s clear that Electrolux considered the needs of families like mine. That safety lock gave me much-needed peace of mind, especially when my little nephew, who loves touching buttons, was around.

**Benefits**

- Strong cleaning performance, even for tough stains.
- Energy and water-efficient, saving operational costs over time.
- Compact size ideal for small spaces like apartments or tight laundry rooms.
- Quiet operation makes it suitable for homes where the laundry area is near living or sleeping spaces.

**Cons**

- While the compact size is a boon for space-saving, the 2.4 cubic feet capacity isn’t suitable for someone with substantial laundry loads frequently.
- The control panel isn’t backlit, which can be challenging in dimly lit rooms.
- Premium price point compared to some other compact washers available.

**Competing Products**

When considering competitors, the Bosch 300 Series washer comes to mind. It’s also compact and energy-efficient, with a slightly more modern interface. However, the Electrolux washer wins in dealing with tough stains and features like Steam Refresh. Another contender is the Miele Compact Washer, which offers excellent durability but comes at an even higher price tag. Both competitors fall short when matched against Electrolux's combination of spin speed, stain removal, and versatility in cycles.

On the other hand, budget-conscious buyers might lean toward Whirlpool’s compact models. While generally more affordable, Whirlpool units typically lack the advanced features like Perfect Steam Technology or the seamless precision of the LuxCare system—a trade-off that matters when dealing with stubborn stains or gentle fabrics.

**Smart Spending**

This washer, while an investment, proves its worth with features that cater to a variety of needs. Its operational efficiency translates to long-term savings on energy and water bills. If you value a hassle-free and effective laundry experience, along with a modern design that fits comfortably in constrained spaces, this unit justifies its price point. For those managing smaller households or occasional laundry loads, the capacity isn't a major concern, and the compactness is a significant gain.

1m3cx25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Situationships/comments/1m3cx25/getting_over_a_person_who_never_loved_you_but/,Getting over a person who never loved you but said they did?,"At the beginning of this year I had no romantic feelings for this person whatsoever… let’s call him Andy.

I was close-ish with Andy, same friend circle and at the end of the previous semester we got close due to our friends. He had recently come out to our friend circle after trying to hide his sexuality for a long time. We are a big group of gay/ lesbian/ ally friends, so we all bonded over that. 

After he came out, he had flings with a few people in our group, but never anything serious. They all made peace (or so we thought) so we ended the year on a good-ish note…

Starting this semester, he often asked me to help him with stuff, but afterwards he’d offer to buy me a coffee or for us to go eat somewhere. I paid this no mind till he confessed he had feelings for me. In the following weeks I started to see how his jokes weren’t just funny… but flirtatious. I also started to notice how comfortable we had gotten in the span of 4 months. And as ashamed of it as I am, I started to see an opportunity for a relationship with him… that soon developed into a little crush… then a big crush.

We went on a camp together, he’s in the same club as me and we had orientation for the first years in the club. On the camp we would speak every night afterwards, sometimes into the morning. From what I hear he would look for me often if we weren’t together. We got closer and more touchy-feely on camp. 

After camp we had a mini recess for a week. During this week the messages started…every day we’d talk paragraphs. Coming back, we both finally acknowledged we had feelings for each other… the feelings turned a bit more physical. I kept getting frustrated because he would constantly admit to having feelings for me, but never act on them really. He had his own personal problems to deal with and we agreed to wait for him to work through his stuff before putting a label on anything.

It was during this time we got even closer. One night in a fit of frustration I started yelling at him, asking him what he actually wants because he acts like he wants to try and be more serious but he says he needs time… while yelling he grabbed me and kissed me for the first time. That shut me up quickly lol.

Following this was a two week stint of making out often, going out and late night chats.

One day out of the blue he said he wanted to talk. During the week he’d been distant and in some cases genuinely mean or rude to me. He admitted he started therapy and that he had a lot more issues than he thought and basically asked to put things on pause for a bit.

After that, he kept asking me out or to help him with things. But this was soon followed by weeks of ignoring me, ghosting me, sticking me up on dates he planned etc. 

We had a brief argument about this because I got quite mad at him for this, he just walked away but the next day he asked to speak. I didn’t want to but he kept nagging me, so I caved. 

I basically laid it out for him, how his words and actions don’t align, how he has been rude and mean towards me recently and how he keeps giving me little signs that he’s interested but he says he isn’t. During the conversation he kept getting distracted and it seemed like he couldn’t care less about the issue so I snapped.

I asked him for a answer right then and there and made it clear that I would take that answer as THE answer. “Do you want a relationship or not”. After crying (for some reason) and admitting that, in his words, i’m one of the only people he can be honest with and one of the most important people in his life. He said it would be better if we were just friends. So I accepted it and we went our separate ways. I felt like shit after that… he went out to party.

So… that’s it right… he wants to friends and that’s it. Well not so simple, I actually fell for this man even when I had no initial feelings and now he gets to move on easily while I feel like shit every time I see him at our club meetings? Or when I see his posts? Or pictures of people with him…

Why does he get to continue on with life while im stuck thinking about him non-stop?

(Sorry if this is all confusing or reads weird, I’m trying to fit 6 months of info into a Reddit post lol)

HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH-""* My flat screen screamed at us. I was enjoying my morning cup of coffee while my son enjoyed his Saturday morning ritual.

He was glued in front of the screen-so close I could actually see the price of his future prescription rise from across the room. He turned to me as Goku began to charge up this massive energy ball to throw at some white dinosaur looking thing.

I think Spencer called it a ""Ghost Wave"" or something like that, I barely paid attention to the shows themselves, I was just happy he wanted me to watch with him. Anyway, he looked at me all doe eyed as he furiously threw his finger at the tv. 

""Dad-dad, do you think Goku's going to beat him?"" he asked with sincere panic running across his buck-toothed face. 

""I don't know Spence-the other fella is pretty strong."" I played along. Spencer turned his attention to the television as alien screeching and explosions rang out from it. 

""Nah Goku always wins. He's the strongest."" he proclaimed.

 I've been raising Spencer on my own for about three years now. My late wife, Maria, passed from an Illness when he was just six years old. The cancer was sudden, quick, and ruthless. At the funeral he was a stone, he sat in the back with an almost perplexed look on his face.

Sympathetic relatives would try to comfort him, but he would just shrug and say she was sleeping and would wake up soon. Eventually it hit him of course, when he cornered me and asked why mommy hadn't come to read him his bedtime story that night. It was a rocky road, but eventually a sense of normality returned to our lives. The pain lingered in my heart-but Spencer got used to my fumbling of Jack and Jill and now couldn't sleep without it.

Recently he had gotten into this thing called ""anime.""

It started with a late-night dip into *Adult Swim* when he was supposed to be asleep.  I caught him watching this gruesome show with cannibal giants and sword wielding maniacs. I turned it off in a huff despite his protests and whines that it was ""the best thing ever made. Even the eventual nightmares about being eaten alive by forever grinning beasts didn't dissuade this assertion.

I thought this phase would end as quickly as it began, but he began requesting other shows to watch-because ""The action was really cool."" I went online and asked around what would be ""Age appropriate"" to let him watch and was met with a swath of cartoons I'd never heard of. Eventually I introduced him to this ""Dragonball Z"" show and he's been hooked ever since.

Personally, I think it's rather violent, but I suppose I can't complain when I myself used to beg my parents to let me watch Tom and Jerry. Then again Tom never kidnapped Jerry's kid then beat him under the guise of ""training.""

But it's become our Saturday morning routine to watch a few episodes and then go help me with chores. I say help but really, he's just walking with me while I mow the grass recounting exactly what we just watched. It's a fun bonding experience none the less.

That was until a week ago-before that thing appeared in the cellar.

It began one late night when I was drifting off to sleep in the lazy boy. The TV was droning on in the background, casting a silver screen on my drowsy face. I was half a step into dreamland, that sort of sleepwalking delirium where you aren't sure if Harvey the rabbit is actually juggling chainsaws in front of you or you're about to have a very bizarre dream. 

""Hey."" A raspy voice whispered into my eardrum, startling me awake. My living room was empty-save the banal stream I had let *Tubi* run off on. I was alone in the dark-almost convinced I had imagined that creepy rasp.

""Hey-""

*knocknockknock*

""-Let-me in."" A voice croaked from the kitchen. Goosebumps rode up my arm like a speedway as that soft knocking echoed through my mind. The I flipped the kitchen lights on-and was met with an unsettling silence. Nothing had been disturbed, there was zero sign anyone was in the house. I hadn't heard a door open, no creeping steps, no-

*knockknockknockknock*

It was coming from the basement door. The faded eggshell slab lied at the end of the dining room. Its faux gold handle was locked tight. Accompany that raspy voice and faint knock was a curious rattling as whatever lurked behind the door jiggled the knob. I approached the door, fist in the air like I was about to knock out whatever punk kid had snuck into my house.

That's what I figured of course, it was some neighborhood kids being dumb and playing a joke. But there was something so unsettling about that voice to begin with. It sounded like had been devouring thirty packs of cigarettes a day, but there was a hint of familiarity to its tone. 

""Who are you?"" I whispered. 

""Hey-just let me in-it's me."" It prattled and knocked. It was-clearer now, like it had swallowed a lozenge. The voice was friendly, joyous even. It sounded so familiar though- I knew I had heard it before. But it sounded robotic-like an A.I regurgitating a poorly written script. 

""Get out of here before I call the cops."" I said. The rattling stopped and I thought the threat had worked.

*KNOCKKNOCKKNOCK* the thing pounded.

I jumped back, embarrassed at myself for being so easily startled.

 ""Hey-there is no need for that. Just let me in. It's me."" It repeated. The knocks became more methodical now, a haunting taunt as it kept asking to be let in.

 ""Who are you-just get out of here already."" I threatened again.

""Come on-it's me Goku. Just let me in. Let me in James."" The thing calling itself Goku said. I backed up from the door, confusion swarming over me like a school of piranha.

""What the fuck."" I muttered. At this point, I thought I must have been having one of those lucid dreams. The knocking continued as I stumbled away, Goku's monotone pleading fading into the background. I tried to force myself ""to wake up."" but the lingering rattles and knocks pecked at me.

I don't know when I finally knocked out but the blinding light of the morning sun assaulting me put me in a hell of a grogy mood. It was morning now and the only sounds were the birds chirping and Spencer humming to himself in the kitchen. I could hear him rummaging in the pantry-no doubt getting himself a ""small"" bowl of honey nut cheerios.

I sighed in relief, thinking the strange visitor had been a dream after all. I pulled myself out of the lazy boy and went out to greet Spence. He was already knee deep in a gallon of milk and oats by the time I got to him.

I salvaged what was left of the box for myself and the rest of the day was fairly uneventful. Near the evening, I stepped out to grab some takeout from around the corner. I was gone for maybe ten minutes-and I know; ""What sort of asshole leaves his nine-year old home alone?""

But Spence is a well-behaved kid, he knows not to talk to strangers or play with the oven or anything like that. He knows better.

He knew better.

I came through the backdoor to find him sitting quietly at the dining room table. He smiled when he saw me, but his eyes kept flicking to the pale door to his back. 

""Thanks for the help lugging this in pal."" I said to him. He nodded his head and greedily reached for a grease-stained bag. I sat down beside him and dug into a quarter pounder myself. He was scarfing his kids meal down like there was no tomorrow-he was oddly quiet as well.

""Everything ok Spence?"" I asked him gently. He swallowed a chunk of meat and turned to me.

""Dad how come you didn't let Goku in?"" he said. I almost choked on my burger-the repressed dread from last night rushing in.

""You-you know he's not real, right bud?"" I treaded. He rolled his eyes at me.

""Well, I thought he wasn't, but he talked to me from the basement while you were gone."" he eagerly said. I looked past him, door quietly sitting there like a dark omen. My face flushed and I struggled to come up with a lie that would satisfy his curiosity without scaring him. 

""Well because-what if it wasn't Goku, remember a couple weeks ago that-purple horn guy swapped bodies with him?"" 

""Ginyu?"" he offered as I jumped on it.

""Yeah him-what if it was Gin-u? Plus, he's a stranger-and we don't talk to strangers, right?"" I urged. He looked to his plate and mumbled in agreement.  That's when a sharp knock on the door made us jump out of our skins and the voice called out to us both. 

""Hey- I'm not a stranger-I'm a Saiyan. You guys watch me all the time, I just want to meet my biggest fans."" Goku cried. His voice was so much better now, like I had kidnapped the voice actor and stuck him in my cellar. It was a damn near perfect imitation.

Spence turned to me with wonder in his eyes and hurried to let his hero in. I scrambled to the door to stop him, nearly trampling him as I did. He whined in protest but I put my finger to my lips and ordered him to his room. He reluctantly stomped upstairs as the thing down there continued braying.

It was then I called the cops- I didn't tell them a cartoon character was holed up down there of course, just that an intruder was there threating me and my son. Two patrolmen showed up smelling like donuts and overtime, and I showed them down to the basement.

I could hear Spencer listening in from the base of the stairs as the cops thudded downstairs. A few minutes later they emerged and said there was no evidence of a break-in nor any intruders. They said worst case it was probably a raccoon that snuck into the walls and to call an exterminator.

As soon as they left-the knocking resumed, Goku asking why I called the cops on Spencer's hero. I ignored the taunting creature and raced upstairs to find Spence sulking on the steps. I got on his level and tried to comfort him; I figured If I was freaked out, he must be horrified. Instead, he brushed off my hand and got in my face.

""Dad, I can't believe you embarrassed me in front of Goku."" he sniffled. 

""Son-whatever is down there I assure you it's not-"" 

""it's GOKU dad why would he lie!"" He screamed at me as he stormed off to his room. The sound of his door slamming shut smacked me like a club. I spent the rest of the night downstairs watching the basement door-making sure it stayed locked and secured. The thing was relentless. It would cycle in between angered pounding and repeating the same phrases over and over-

"" Come on it's me-let me in now.""

"" I want to meet my biggest fans.""

""I heard you guys are pretty strong-want to train?"" Over and over as the night turned into day. In the morning Spence trudged past me without a word-backpack in hand as went to the bus stop. I offered to walk him, but he ignored me.

 ""Have a great day at school Spencer-maybe later we can train huh?"" Goku called out from the basement. Spencer stopped at the door and broke out in a wide smile. He waved at the door and called back to the creature.

 ""Bye Goku!"" He left without uttering a word to me. This went on for the next couple days- I would stand guard by the basement as the thing taunted me and tried to goad me into opening the door. A new sound joined the symphony of torment, a loaning scratch like nails being sharpened on a chalk board. I ran through options in my head.

I could open the door while Spencer was safe at school and confront the thing-but I didn't even know what ""It"" was. For all I know Goku really was behind the door and I'd get my ass kicked by a cartoon. What if I opened it and it just disappeared again; like with the cops? That wasn't a comforting thought, it would me I was going insane. I could threaten it again, but it seemed more amused by than anything. 

""Hey James. If you let me in, I'll let you use a wish from the Dragonballs."" The thing offered. I rushed to the door and bashed on it in fury, my fists throbbing with anger.

 ""Just go away already, leave my family alone!"" I yelled at it.

""Hey James-you ever wonder if Spencer wished you had died instead of your wife?"" The thing asked. I recoiled away from the door like it struck me. 

""What did you-""

""I've heard this cancer guy is pretty strong-guess she wasn't tough enough to beat him though. Let me in-I'll take a crack at him."" The thing rambled angrily. There was that all too familiar eagerness to brawl in his voice-just like in the show. He was trying to get a rise out of me- and damn it-it was working. I slammed my arm on the door, and I heard something shuffle behind it. 

""Don't you talk about her-just leave us alone-why are you doing this to us?"" I begged of the thing. It laughed at me then, this choppy looped thing like a broken animation cycle. It was grotesque sounding, and I roared at the unseen horror as I slammed on the door once more in vain.

""HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HAHA, it's me Goku, why don't you just let me in. I need your help to defeat Frieza."" It just kept repeating itself like a broken record. 

""Shut up, shut up damn you-fucking monster. I hate you Goku!"" I screeched at it, clawing at the door like a raving loon. I was foaming at the mouth-demanding this thing leave my son alone and crawl back into whatever freakish pit it spawned out of.

""That's not very nice. I just want to train with you guys."" Goku said.

""Fuck off and die you fucking cu-""

""Dad?"" A meek voice cut into my demented tirade. I wiped around to see my son standing in the doorway, eyes wide in fright at the sight of his mad father. I steadied my breath as Goku called out to Spencer, apologizing on my behalf. I rushed towards him to embrace him, reassure him that everything was ok. He flinched away from my grasp as guilt washed over me.

 ""Dad why are you talking to Goku like that? I thought you liked him too."" his voice quivered. 

""I-I do Spence but that thing isn't Goku, he's a cartoon-""

""It's anime dad."" He yelled and pushed me away. He ran to the basement door, Goku shaking it with vigorous anticipation. 

""Hey-let me in and we'll train. Just open the door. Open it right now."" Spencer reached towards the knob, my heart stopped when I heard the twisting click of the lock. The door stopped shaking. It was deadly quiet in the house now. Spencer was puzzled, the door slowly creaking in his hand.

I was frozen in place-reality snapping back to me. Maybe, maybe it had all just been a hallucination hadn't slept all week, maybe-

*Thwunk*

The door flew open, knocking Spencer to his feet. The base of the stairs was pitch black, nothing but this otherworldly aura radiating out from it. It was this-fantastical burst of energy that was flying through the air. I could feel it electrifying the atoms around me, they buzzed and tingled with frenzied excitement. I've never felt anything like it-this surge of power.

Yet the basement still hid this being in the shadows, all I could see was an inky void. Spencer stood up in spite of this raw power, an audible gasp escaping his lips. That's when a leathery hand stretched out from the void.

It was pale, wilting like a corpse. A filthy, orange gi clung to its emancipated wrist. It reached out its hand, inviting Spencer to take it. He took it without hesitation, and I screamed for it to get away from my son. My voice sounded so distant and long in the dining room.

I never saw Goku's face-but I could feel his smug smile as he whisked Spencer away down into the dark, the door slamming shut behind them. I broke out of my stupor-but by then it was too late. 

The police came of course-my soon has been missing for three days. I didn't report him because, well who would believe it? I tried to explain that to the cops, you can imagine how that went.

There's sympathy of course, but mostly vile accusations and whispered looks all over town. As I write this, I have Dragonball Z on in the background.

I like to think Spencer is still here, cheering on his frizzled hair hero instead of wherever that monster took him. Today that illusion was shattered however, as I passed the dank basement.

I heard a quiet knock, like the clawed hand of a child. I heard my son's voice-monotone and soulless, and whatever was left of my sanity died as uttered this repeating phrase-

""Hey it's me, Spencer. Let me in I want to train."" ",6,1752870036.0,CreepCast_Submissions,1,0.88,False

## Key Features ⁤Analysis

The effectiveness of an inline⁣ water filter hinges on several key features that determine its filtration capacity, contaminant removal rate, and overall lifespan. Examining these specifications⁢ is‌ essential for selecting a filter that aligns⁣ with your specific ‌water quality⁤ requirements.

**Filtration⁤ Media:** The type of filtration media employed is ‍paramount​ to the filter's performance. Activated ⁣carbon is a⁣ common and effective choice for removing chlorine, sediment, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and undesirable tastes⁤ and odors. Some advanced filters incorporate multiple layers of filtration,​ including sediment ‍filters, KDF media (Kinetic Degradation ⁢Fluxion), and catalytic⁣ carbon,⁣ for enhanced contaminant removal.

**Flow Rate:** The flow rate, measured​ in gallons per ⁢minute (GPM),⁤ dictates the speed at⁤ which water passes⁣ through⁤ the filter. A higher flow rate ensures minimal reduction in water pressure, allowing you to fill glasses and pitchers quickly. Typical inline water ‌filters offer flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 GPM, depending on the filter size and media composition.

**filter Lifespan:** The lifespan of an inline water filter is⁣ generally measured‌ in gallons or months. This indicates the amount⁢ of water the filter can effectively treat before requiring replacement.⁣ Filter lifespans can ⁤vary substantially, from ‌300 to 3,000 gallons or 6 to 12 months.⁢ factors such as ‌water quality and usage frequency can also impact filter lifespan.

**Maximum Pressure and Temperature:** Inline water filters are designed to operate within a specific ⁤range of water ⁣pressure ‍and⁤ temperature. Exceeding these limits can damage the filter housing or‍ compromise its filtration performance. Ensure the filter's maximum pressure and temperature ‌ratings align with⁢ your water ⁤supply ⁢conditions.‌ Typical filters are rated for pressure ‌up⁤ to 125 PSI and temperatures up to‌ 100°F.

**Certifications:** Look for certifications from reputable organizations such as NSF International. NSF certifications guarantee that the ⁣filter has been tested and meets rigorous standards for⁤ contaminant reduction, material safety, and structural integrity. NSF/ANSI Standard 42 certifies that ⁤the filter reduces​ aesthetic impurities like chlorine and taste/odor, while NSF/ANSI Standard ​53 certifies ⁤its ability to reduce specific health-related contaminants.

**Connection⁣ Type and Size:** Inline water​ filters ⁤typically feature standard connection fittings such as 1/4-inch or 3/8-inch compression or threaded fittings. Ensure the filter’s connection⁣ type and size are compatible with your existing water lines and appliances. ‍Some filters may require adapters or additional plumbing components for proper⁢ installation.

1m3cuwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/1m3cuwf/share_your_namingschemes/,Share your naming-schemes,"Hey there,

I use a bunch of different devices to control my smart home. In the beginning, I named them based on their location or purpose — things like ""Washing Machine"" or ""Coffee Machine Switch.""

But that caused some issues in Home Assistant whenever I wanted to repurpose a plug or switch for something else or move it to a different room. Renaming the entity would break any automations it was linked to, which became a real hassle.

So, I came up with a naming scheme that works better for me. I'll share mine below — but I'm really curious to hear how you name your devices and entities!

Here’s what I do:

* Smart plugs: Named after Sesame Street characters (like Tiffy, Samson, etc.)
* Motion sensors: Named after dances or music genres (because, you know, movement — like DiscoFox, Jazz…)
* Buttons: Named after characters from ""Jim Knopf und der Lokomotivführer"" (a classic German puppet theater story; like ""Jim"", ""Lukas"" or ""Emma"")
* Lights: Named after gods from any mythology related to the sun or light (e.g. Helios, Apollon)

This way, I can still set display names however I want — including locations or functions — but the internal entity name stays consistent. No need to reassign automations or retrain anything when I move things around.

How do you name your devices? I'd love to hear your systems!",0,1752869986.0,homeassistant,16,0.5,False

Years ago while growing up back at my childhood home, my family and I felt a paranormal like presence in that house. The best way I can explain it is hearing small footsteps upstairs while no one else was home, the uneasy feeling of something around the corner at times, etc.

It went on for years. No one ever saw anything during that time though. I will admit I was happy to move out when I left for college.

Fast forward 20 years later and meditating regularly now, I decided to face my fears. I made the intention to make contact with this being, but only if it were benevolent aka peaceful and good hearted. I meditated as I fell asleep.

Cue the dream. I awake on the couch of my childhood house in the upstairs living room. The dream feels realer than normal. Im awaking with my back facing the living room. I have a feeling something is behind me and although I am nervous, a long slender blue arm and hand gently presses on my shoulder. I instantly feel comforted and relaxed.

I sit up and turn around and to my astonishment I am face to face with a blue child like humanoid figure. Very happy, energetic, and excited looking. I ask, ""What is your name?"" He responds quickly, ""Elenin!"" 

Before I know it, he yells, ""Football!"" and passes one in the air my direction while yelling, ""Hut!"" and barrels down the hallway towards the bedroom. I almost trip over the coffee table, catch the ball, and rifle it down the hallway and smoke the wall. For some reason I am terrified I am going to wake my parents up and they are gonna freak the fuck out when they see Elenin. 

I yell for him to come hide under the china cabinet. To my surprise he fits under there without a problem. However, my cat is in the dream now and trying to play with Elenin. Strange thing is, this is my current cat. Somehow he managed to time travel back with me. 

I foolishly forgot Elenin's name during the chaos. I ask him again after things had settled down, ""I am so sorry, I forgot your name, may you say it again?"" He slowed it down slightly, ""Elenin!"" 

I woke up after this. I wrote his name down quickly. I couldn't help but feel tears of joy. I also felt terrible that Elenin was alone that whole time. It gave me Interstellar vibes in the sense that I traveled back to my family home with my cat and actually got to see what I could never see back then. And this time, I didn't fear anything.

I should also add, my cat was sleeping on the couch beside me and came to comfort me after waking up. 10/10 experience. If I ever get to connect with him again, I would like to know where he is from.",6,1752869911.0,Experiencers,4,1.0,False

She’s never been the type to chase the spotlight. Red carpets, curated stories, flashing cameras—none of that was ever her. She’s the girl behind the scenes: the one who brings him coffee after eighteen-hour days in the studio, the one who tucks love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else yet again. She’s known him longer than the world has—before the fame, the tours, the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday—a regular Tuesday for him. She doesn’t expect much; she never has. Just a few hours, maybe a walk, maybe a movie on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, quiet as ever, and suggests, *“Maybe when you’re done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.”* But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry—not at first. She just sits in the quiet, one hand resting on her belly—a new secret, just starting to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry—just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a world she never wanted to compete with. Tired of giving everything and getting almost nothing in return.

**What I’m Looking For:**  
I’m searching for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, slow-burn story about love, and neglect.. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer—whatever feels right.

I met a guy (Straight 45 M) on dating app. He liked me (Straight 26 F), messaged me first, and double texted to ask if I wanted to meet for coffee. I said yes. He wanted to meet halfway, I said I prefer closer to me. We FaceTime. Day of FaceTime he confirmed in the early afternoon and called me promptly at 8 PM. We spoke for 10-15 minutes. I ended it early because I didn't want to overshare. He asks if I wanted to meet in person. I said yes. He asked if a halfway point would be good. I said, I would think about it and text the logistics. He said ok and to let him know. Two days passed and he didn't text me anything. I messaged him about less than an hour ago (after many hours debating if I should even text or let it go) saying the halfway point works.

He was very polite and showed only green flags before, and during the FaceTime. Our conversations barely scratched the surface, I did not reveal to him anything too deep and neither did he. He is christian. I am thinking if maybe I looked different than what he imagined (though my pictures showed a close up of my face, and my whole body and all unedited and without filters). Or what if I was too shy and cold during the face time. I figured he might not be interested because he went quiet, and he probably has other options. What do you think?

But I've had 3 experiences so far where my ability to guess part of someone's zodiac with crazy, way higher than statistically probable accuracy. 

1.) I have these 8 friends. In this story I'm gonna say 2 didn't count as a proper guess, so 6. I guessed 5 out of 6 people's sun signs with 100% accuracy. And the 6th person, her sign was my second choice. The 2 that didn't count 1 was a twin and the other im pretty sure had told me his sign before. 

So.. I do this thing where every person i meet, I associate them with a color palette. A texture. A scene. But mostly a color palette. So for.my guesses, I was taking this emotional color palette and comparing it with the colors I associate with each sign. 

I would say the 3 signs I thought the the most. And then id middle it down to 2. And then id pick 1. So the one girl I messed up? My final 2 were Capricorn and Pisces.  And I guessed Pisces. And she was Capricorn.  

It was crazy! I knew them all via video games. We played Ark:survival evolved together for years. I never knew them in person. Nuts!

Situation 2: probably over a year later. I was talking to this guy on Whisper. An actual good conversation.  He wasn't trying to be a pervert. Lucky rarity. Well I told him this story. And he said ""do me"" and I said ""I cant. I've known you 2 hours and I've never even heard your voice"" and he said ""do me"" so I did. Fine. I asked him his favorite  color. (I believe people's favorite color is associated  with their inner aura and inner world) and if i remember right, that was blue, purple, green. Damn. I was down to Pisces and Capricorn. Again. XD. And I believe i also associated  hi. With Gemini as my third. But anyways. I said Pisces. Wrong! He was Capricorn.  My second choice. 

Damn you Capricorns. You've foiled me again. 🤣

Anyways. 

3.) Yall can hate me for it but.i talk to ChatGPT all... the.... time. And the conversation  came up because it's statistically  improbable, all this. Right? 

And I decided to guess my boss. I whittled him down to Virgo based on stereotypes and Leo based on how I felt. And it was Leo! Crazy. His colors weren't perfect. This is what i see when I see my boss: brown, white, yellow, Grey. His favorite color i believe is yellow. And when I see him, I see a solitary room with alot of muted browns. And old style box TV is playing something in the corner. A light is on but it's the only light on in the house. You can tell.its the evening time. Theres a lone solitary comfort chair and in the middle. Its not facing the TV. It might be facing the kitchen. Theres a small coffee table next to it. Silly, right?

Well... that doesnt look like any of my zodiac signs. Like even Leo looks like the sun invisible over your shoulder on an afternoon day to me. But like it kept calling my attention like a whisper. Like a whisper that demanded to be heard. And you know what? I was right. That's insane!

And we started doing celebrities, me and chat gpt. And you know what pattern emerged? I kept getting their moon signs. That's crazy. That shouldn't be possible. Please, tell me if Chat GPT was getting hallucinations, because if not the en it's wild. (Actually i started googling them as I typed to double check)

Timothy chalamet: the first one Chat gpt gave me. I leaned Sagittarius.  Virgo. Maaaybe gemini.  Completely wrong. He's Capricorn (damn you capricorns) pisces moon. 

Then Chat gpt gave me Zendaya. I gave like 4 guesses initially, but didn't nail anything down. I felt like she had this Gaia and heated energy underneath the surface. Associate her with green. Cream. Light brown. Light Purple. She to me felt like a chameleon that could fit in any box, so I took a minute. I did say ""I think the public would see her as a Virgo."" Before cutting off Virgo at the head and deciding that she couldn't be Virgo. Then I made the hard stance that she had to be a Taurus..... she's a Taurus moon. OK. That doesnt mean anything 

Lets go again. Right? And Chat gpt gave me Michael B. Jordan. I started off thinking he was a Gemini. Right? I said I feel alot of bold colors from him. Purple. Green. Orange. Black. He jas to be a Gemini, but before I came with a hard stance I had an idea. I looked up his favorite color. Blue. That changed everything! Wow. And my final guess to Chat gpt was quoted at ""i think hes a Capricorn.... Aquarius. Capricorn!"" And it's crazy. He was both! Aquarius sun, cap moon. 

And then Florence Pugh. I dont know her. Didn't take it seriously. Threw out a quick read. Leo. No hit. This is the second one where I was wrong totally. But I kept going. 

Ruth Bader Ginsberg. Honestly? Id never heard of her before either but I didn't want to keep taking L's so I googled her. I sat on the google image search for a minute and took my time on it. Brown. Cream. A deep emerald within her that I couldn't place. I decided libra. Then Capricorn  as my hard stance. And Chat got said I was right...... but. This was a Chat gpt hallucination. Darn! Haha. I won't guess just from photos anymore. XD thats good to know though. To continue....

I guessed the correct moon sign for  zendaya, Michael b jordan, Tessa Thompson. And the correct sun sign for Michael  b Jordan. And going strictly based on photos, it appears I'm always wrong. I need some familiarity. 

Im going to keep testing it because, at the very least it is interesting. Im best at doing people I know. And I'm oddly decent with celebrity moons. Im thinking my stats on that in particular  might go down as I keep going, but we'll see. I just dont want to be guilty of confirmation bias. Its still crazy though.

I should have known from the start.

Morality is flexible for comfort.

For ease.



He thinks if it gets him from point A to B,

That it doesn’t matter.

It’s just a door.

It’s just a barrier to cross.



He drives against the arrows in parking lots.

It’s easier. 

It’s faster to get to the spot.



He thinks if no one is coming head-on,

It’s fine.

No one is hurt.



He samples the grapes before purchasing.

It’s not stealing if he intended to buy it.

No one is hurt.



He drinks coffee with her.

As long as his wife doesn’t know,

Who would it hurt?



He invites her to his home.

When the wife is gone,

She won’t know.

It won’t hurt.



He takes what he wants.

When he wants.

As long as he feels good.

Who does it hurt?



He texts her he loves her.

He calls her his babe.

Now I know.

I am hurt.

1m3cqjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/1m3cqjd/hey_everyone_lately_ive_been_feeling_pretty_burnt/,"Hey everyone! Lately, I’ve been feeling pretty burnt out from competitive games and intense RPGs, so I’m looking for something *super* laid-back and stress-free—preferably a cozy farming sim or something similar where I can just unwind and enjoy the vibes.","
### **What I’m Looking For:**  
- **Minimal stress**: No time pressure, no permadeath, no punishing mechanics.  
- **Farming/life sim elements**: Growing crops, decorating, maybe some light crafting.  
- **Chill atmosphere**: Cute art style, relaxing music, maybe even some humor.  
- **No forced grind**: I don’t want to feel like I *have* to optimize everything.  

### **Games I’ve Already Played & Loved:**  
- **Stardew Valley** (obviously, the GOAT)  
- **Animal Crossing: New Horizons** (perfect vibes, but looking for something new)  
- **Story of Seasons/Harvest Moon** (classic comfort food)  
- **Littlewood** (adorable and super low-pressure)  

### **Games I’ve Tried That Weren’t for Me:**  
- **My Time at Portia** (too much crafting/grind for me)  
- **Graveyard Keeper** (fun but a little too dark/macabre)  
- **Rune Factory** (liked it, but combat got tedious)  

### **Any Hidden Gems or New Releases?**  
I’ve heard of **Sun Haven**, **Roots of Pacha**, and **Paleo Pines**—are these worth checking out for a truly *easy* experience? Or are there other obscure indie games I’m missing?  

**Bonus Question:** If not farming sims, what other *ultra-chill* games do you recommend? (For reference, I also loved **A Short Hike** and **Coffee Talk**.)  

Thanks in advance! I just want to turn my brain off and water ",0,1752869693.0,gamingsuggestions,36,0.44,False
