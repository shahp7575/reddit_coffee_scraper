1oyvshy,https://i.redd.it/9qid9otbeo1g1.jpeg,LOOKING FOR THE LINK OF MY LAST GOODBYE TO YOU,"Chapter 1

My husband, Ronan Samford, was leaving on a ""farewell trip"" with his personal assistant, Abigail Michell.

Ignoring my colorless face, he said, ""Honey, Abby has done so much for me. I can't marry her, and this is her only wish before she quits. Can't you just let me do this for her?""

""Ronan,"" I whispered, ""would you still go if I told you that leaving now means never seeing me again?""
Then he grabbed me and slammed me to the ground.

A cold laugh escaped him.

""So what if I'll never see you again? I couldn't care less. Stop being dramatic.""

I watched him walk away, my heart shattering.
He had no idea that I only had three months left to live.

***

Ronan's resolute figure faded into the distance.

I still sat on the floor, staring into space.

When sticky blood started seeping from my knees, I finally felt the pain.

""Ouch..."" I cried out.

My knees were a mess of torn skin and blood.

A dull, throbbing ache spread through my whole body.

The doctor said that in these final months, even minor pains would feel intensely magnified.

What would be a slight discomfort for most people became an excruciating agony for me.

I used every bit of strength to push myself up, shuffling back into the house like a stray dog.

A deep weariness settled over me. I didn't feel like doing anything.
I just let the blood dry on my skin and sat there, motionless, until dusk.

The ringtone of my phone finally jolted me back to reality.
""Latonya, have you made up your mind?"" the doctor's voice came through. ""The chemotherapy will be very painful, and it's not guaranteed to extend your time.
""Honestly, I'd recommend palliative care. Don't waste your final days on a hospital bed, staring at your loved ones' sad faces.
""You should discuss this with your husband.""

The doctor's voice trailed off, tinged with sadness and pity.
My mind slowly cleared.
""Thanks, but I won't be doing the chemotherapy.""

My initial plan had been to endure the brutal treatment, to fight for more time.

I'd been worried about Ronan falling apart when he learned about my impending death.

But now, it seemed I'd overestimated my importance.

Sometimes, facing the harsh truth makes things simpler.

With no one left in this world who truly cared for me, why waste medical resources?

I struggled to my feet, disinfected the wounds, and bandaged them myself.

While washing my hands, I caught my reflection in the mirror and froze.
I couldn't remember the last time I'd bothered to take care of my appearance.

I used to care so much about how I looked.

In just six months, the cancer had stolen all my vitality.

I looked like a completely different person.

The day I got my diagnosis six months ago, I felt like I was plunged into the abyss of despair.
I called Ronan, who hadn't been home in over two weeks.

But he was at a gala with Abigail.
He hissed into the phone, impatient and angry, ""Latonya, are you ever going to stop? Don't you know I'm busy? Do you have to bother me with every little thing? Can't you handle anything yourself? I provide everything for you. The least you can do is be reasonable!""

In the background, I heard Abigail's chuckles.

She said in a honeyed tone, ""Mr. Samford, Ms. Tinsley must be so bored stuck at home all day. Don't be so harsh. You'll hurt her feelings.""

That had been my wake-up call.

After seven years of marriage, he'd grown tired of me—so tired that whether I lived or died didn't seem to matter to him anymore.

""Never mind. Ronan, I'd set you free soon enough.

This would be our final goodbye.

Chapter 2

People never really know how much they can handle until they're pushed to the edge.

Somehow, over one long night, I made my peace with dying.

I gave myself a proper skincare routine, and my complexion finally looked a little better.

A small sense of comfort settled over me.

For my last days, I didn't want to look too terrible.

After months of restless nights, I fell asleep surprisingly fast that night.

In my dream, I was running, chasing the blurred figures of a man and a woman ahead.

I felt this urgent need to see their faces clearly.

I finally saw them turn, just as I was completely spent.

The man, his features cold, pulled the woman into a protective embrace.

He stared at me with pure disgust.
A wave of profound sadness washed over me, jolting me awake.
Even now, when I was awake, my heart still raced with fear.

The clock read 2 AM.
I checked my phone and saw a WhatsApp friend request.

Curious, I accepted it.

Immediately, I received a video from this very account.

The background looked like a noisy nightclub.

Ronan laughed, trying to dodge the camera with a helpless look.
""Okay, stop messing around. I brought you to your favorite spot, didn't I? What do you need me on camera for anyway?""

Abigail teasingly chased him with the phone camera, aiming at him as he moved.

""No way! I finally have you all to myself. I want to keep your image in my phone forever, so I can look at you whenever I miss you.""

Her voice choked with emotion.
Ronan paused, his expression full of distress as he looked at her.
He gave her a resigned smile.

""Abby, we met at the wrong time. I can't hold you back. I'd endure anything just to see you happy.""
The last frame showed Abigail melting into his arms.
He held her tightly, his embrace filled with a tenderness I had never, ever received from him.
The regret and sorrow on his face felt like a physical blow.
So, I was the villain standing between these ""lovers.""
No wonder fate was ready to take me away.

I closed the video with a bitter laugh.
The WhatsApp account was obviously Abigail's.
She just couldn't help but rub it in my face.
Abigail had joined Ronan's company a year ago.

She was a graduate from a top university, tall, with a face full of youthful energy.

Young and inexperienced, she looked up to Ronan with pure admiration.
What man could easily resist that, especially when his own marriage had grown stale over the years?
Ronan became unprecedentedly ""busy"" with work.

He started taking this young assistant on business trips everywhere.

He came home less often, and when he did, he was always glued to his phone.

Calls from Abigail frequently reached our home.

At first, it was about work, then it turned into casual chats.
He even started asking her for advice on matching his clothes.
Slowly, there was nothing left for me to take care of—all the things I used to handle were now her job.
Once, I couldn't hold back and asked about it, but he just got annoyed.
""Abby has good taste. What's wrong with me asking her? You stay cooped up at home all day. What could you possibly know about style?
""Stop being so paranoid. It's annoying.""

Years as a housewife must have worn down all my edges, leaving me timid.
Hearing that enough, I started to disgust myself, so I stopped asking.
I just swallowed the hurt.
Now that I thought about it, all that overthinking probably worsened my anxiety.

It was probably one of the reasons I got sick.

Feeling lost and numb, I fell back asleep.

The next morning, I went to the hospital for one last check-up.
The doctor looked at me with pity.
""Are you sure about traveling? You don't have much time left. You might ... pass away far from home with no family around.""

Chapter 3

The word ""family"" made me think of my parents, long buried, and my husband, currently tending to another woman.

A bitter smile touched my lips.
""I have no family left, Dr. Luther.
""I've never had the chance to see much of this beautiful country. Wherever I end up, it'll be a good place to rest. I have no regrets.""
Holden Luther prescribed me a sufficient supply of medication.
He went over the instructions again and again, his worry evident.
He walked me to the elevator, his face still etched with deep concern.
As I thought about the past year of treatment, a sudden wave of emotion hit me.

Since I got sick, Holden, who owed me nothing, had cared for me the most.

He'd been like a father and a friend.

I looked at him, my eyes burning.
Words of thanks felt empty.
Thus, I bowed deeply to him.
His lips trembled, like he wanted to say something, but in the end, he just forced a smile and waved at me, watching me step into the elevator.
Back home, I set about clearing out all of my belongings from the house.
I didn't have much stuff.

After marrying Ronan, all my attention had been on him.
I'd barely bought anything for myself since.

He'd occasionally tease me, ""Honey, we're not that hard up. Even if you spent more, I could afford it. Don't be such a penny-pincher.""

He'd even gotten me a supplementary credit card, urging me to go shopping sometimes.

I was touched by his thoughtfulness, but I never used it, not once.
Before leaving, I placed the card and my wedding ring on the coffee table.

Every trace of me was now erased from the house.

I took one last look at the small home I'd lived in for seven years.
We'd bought this place with a mortgage when we got married.

After his business took off, Ronan suggested moving to a bigger place several times, but I could never bring myself to leave.

I was just a nostalgic person.
Now, a genuine pang of sadness finally hit me.

Saying goodbye isn't easy.
Just as I closed the door, my phone rang.

It was Ronan calling.

""Honey, sorry, I drank too much last night and forgot to check in. What are you up to?""

Checking in was a habit we'd kept since we started dating.
I'd always insisted we let each other know we were safe, no matter where we were.

""You don't need to do that anymore.""
His voice dropped. ""What's that supposed to mean?""

I was struggling for a response when our neighbor from across the door happened to step out.
She asked, surprised, ""Mrs. Samford, are you going on a trip?""
Then, Ronan's voice took on an angry edge.

""Where are you going? Why are you always so competitive? Abby wants to go on a trip, so you have to do it, too? I don't get why you've been so unreasonable lately.
""You want to compare yourself to her? Fine. I'll play along. Let's see how far you take this.""
He hung up in anger.
Strangely, I felt a wave of relief.
I didn't care what he thought.
It saved me the trouble of making up an excuse.

Half an hour later, I was at the airport.

I bought a ticket for the next flight to Asheville.
It wasn't peak travel season, so the airport wasn't too crowded.
Asheville had always been a place I wanted to visit.

Having grown up in the north, I'd always harbored romantic notions about the south.

I'd begged Ronan to take me there for our honeymoon.

But back then, his company was just starting up, and he was swamped with endless social events and cases.
He'd looked exhausted, pleading with me, ""Honey, I'm just so tired. Cut me some slack, okay? Once the company is stable, I'll take you anywhere you want. Just wait for me.""

Back then, I'd buried my face in his chest, thinking that as long as I was with him, the place didn't matter.

We could go later.

Yet, after seven years of waiting, he was going on that trip with another woman.

Fate was playing a cruel joke on me.
I turned to the window and shook off the gloomy thoughts.

The blue sky above the airport surprisingly lifted my mood.

My phone rang just as the airport announced boarding for my flight.

I glanced down. It was from Ronan again.

1oyvrh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoetryWritingClub/comments/1oyvrh1/the_invisible_weight/,The Invisible Weight,"This poem was born from all the moments I’ve looked around a staffroom, classroom, or corridor and seen someone who “looked fine.” The kind of person who laughs at the right time, keeps it together, gets things done — but underneath, they’re carrying a rucksack full of invisible weight.

We rarely notice that weight until it starts to show — in tired eyes, a quiet sigh, or a forced smile.
I wrote The Invisible Weight as a reminder that sometimes, the smallest act of empathy — a conversation, a genuine question, a moment of listening — can make that rucksack a little lighter.

The Invisible Weight

You’re the kind of person who looks so strong,
You float through life like nothing’s wrong.
A smile constantly stitched on your face,
Joy and calmness — not a hair out of place.

Your laughter is like a knight’s armour,
But keeping it together is becoming harder.
Coffee cup clutched like a shield,
Desperate for the truth not to be revealed.

But I can see a rucksack full of stone,
Surrounded by people, yet all alone.
I see the bruise behind the smile,
The stumble as you go the extra mile.

How long have you been carrying that load?
How far on your own, travelling the road?
How much does that invisible pack weigh?
What can I do to take it away?

In your shoes I might not be able to walk,
But I can lighten your heart with the gift of talk.
Empathy — the bridge between two hearts,
And a question is often how it starts.

Bit by bit, we’ll unpack your freight,
And replace each stone with half its weight.
The guilt, the fear, the loneliness, the grief,
For forgiveness, acceptance, faith, and belief.

Empathy costs nothing, yet can lift everything 
It strengthens us, like weights in the gym.
The heaviest loads aren’t made of stone;
They fade when we know we’re not alone.

You’re still the kind of person who looks so strong,
But now I see you’ve found where you belong.
Your coffee — your armour — no longer a mask;
If you need help carrying your backpack, just ask.",1,1763323813.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False

Ive had a blue smoke coming out of my back and burning oil more than i should but it seemed to be due to me being dumb and forgetting to tighted the screws on the top of the engine. however, it does seem my coolant looks like a nice morning coffee which im not happy about and i know that means either head gasket decided its time to say goodbye or i have a problem with my oil cooler (which im hoping is the case). I have noticed that i do lose more oil than coolant and i actually noticed that the little plastic container where you fill it is actually topped off (it wasnt like few days ago) which does make me lean more towards oil cooler failure - oil mixing with coolant not coolant with oil in the engine. I just want to hear some more opinions as the gasket replacement is gonna be a pretty expensive repair for me in my country (i got quoted like 2000$ which is more than i can afford right now) or maybe its somehow something else?",1,1763323621.0,MechanicAdvice,1,1.0,False

Consider the alternative: humans don’t resolve internal contradictions.
They simply stack them, the way someone with too many books starts using the dining table as auxiliary shelving.

Anecdotal evidence (i.e., being alive) suggests people simultaneously carry:

belief A and not-A,

incompatible intentions,

parallel narratives that never meet,

and still manage to wake up at 7am, pay bills and remember to buy coffee.


This feels less like classical logic and more like a kind of domestic paraconsistency, where contradictions coexist because nobody has the computational budget for a full epistemic defragmentation.

The question then isn’t “why are we incoherent?” but:
what if this structured incoherence is the native architecture?

This creates several entertaining possibilities:

1. Internal contradictions might be efficient features,
like emotional multitasking but without the TED-talk optimism.


2. “Decisions” may simply be whichever internal state won the five-second election.
A sort of low-turnout epistemic democracy.


3. Simulations with single-logic agents are modeling imaginary rational aliens.
Humans might be more realistic if they had multiple logics active and a pragmatic, improvisational switching heuristic.


4. Computational systems inspired by this might better mimic human subtleties,
especially the very human ones like “planning to sleep at 11pm and opening 17 Wikipedia tabs at 2am.”



So my question is:
is there any good formalization for a cognitive architecture with persistent contradictions and pragmatic mode-switching?

Thinking of something between:

hierarchical Bayesian models,

paraconsistent logics,

multi-state phenomenological machines,

or some obscure Soviet paper from the 70s that explained everything and nobody translated.

“Please don’t get me more stuff. Get me something I’ll actually use.”

Quality > Quantity One good present beats five “throwaway” ones every time. Last year I got a Kozi Sleep pillow and it genuinely changed how I sleep. I still use it every night and it’s probably the most useful gift I’ve gotten in years.

Useful > Gimmicky Someone gave my brother a streaming subscription for a year instead of T-Rex LED lights, a random diffuser and a coffee mug. Guess which one he uses every single day?

Experiences > Physical Stuff My girlfriend and I decided to give each other an experience (a proper date night) this Christmas. As new parents, those moments aren’t exactly guaranteed anymore, and honestly? Time together feels more valuable than anything you can wrap. The same counts for our family.

People seem burned out by cheap, unsustainable gifts that break fast or end up forgotten by January.

There’s something refreshing about choosing one meaningful, high-quality gift instead of a pile of clutter.

I had oily skin before starting and had the perfect skincare routine (for me) to manage it. 

I expected the acne and the ingrown hairs but I did not expect my face (mainly nose and forehead) to be a literal slip and slide. 

Any advice on products I can change or add to manage this? I have sensitive skin (thanks to MCAS) so I prefer products with fewer ingredients but I'll definitely try holy grail products if the ingredients list doesn't have something I know for sure I'm allergic to. 

Products I use:

Daily:
Byoma Milky Moisture Cleanser (twice daily)
The Ordinary Glicolic Acid 7% Exfoliating Toner
Byoma Ultralight Face Fluid SPF 50
Elf Holy Hydration Daily Moisturizer (twice daily)
100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Brightening Eye Cream (twice daily)
Differin Adapaline Gel 0.1% (only on problem acne or ingrown hair problem areas)

Once a week or as needed:
Hero Pore Purify Cleansing Clay Mask
Origins Drink Up Intensive Overnight Mask 
The Ordinary BHA AHA Peeling Solution (when acne is particularly bad)
Murad Deep Relief Acne Treatment (when cystic acne appears)

This routine worked perfectly, and still does for managing acne. But I'm so greasy I my makeup is melting off even with a primer

1oyvdwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oyvdwu/wakeywakey_part_one/,Wakey-Wakey (Part One),"Every night since I lost my job, I pray for death without fail, even though every prayer so far has failed me. I’m not broken up about losing the job itself—not at all—but it still haunts my life in too many ways. I can’t escape what I’ve seen—what I know. I’ve tried to obliterate my brain with just about every drug under the sun, to reduce it to a sludge similar to what I used to ship. Liquor, weed, speed, acid, meth. You can find anything you need in a shithole borough like New Wakefield, PA, so long as you know what rocks to turn over. Well, anything except that sludge, now. Wakey-Wakey Coffee Co. is dead. But as in life, it’s a mean son of a bitch that won’t pry its teeth out of you. In many ways. 

Growing up in central PA, melancholy is an attitude you’re raised with. Life prospects are rarely peachy, unless you’re wealthy and retired, failing further with every Fall in Appalachia, letting the mountains embrace your weary yet satisfied bones as if they are ancient parents unknown. The younger you are, the less money you’re likely have. What brief illusions of freedom most of us have are merely four-year academic vacations that gift us greater awareness and double damnation in debt. Ultimately, we see the prison bars too late and are forced to pay back interest on the renovations of our cells. To add to my youthful misery, I’m a Lit major and a redditor, as you’ve probably gathered. I apologize for any further off-track musings, but you must understand that such explorations afford me what little escape from the nightmare I have. Even before college, I was fated between two options of living: slaving away in a hole in the ground, or slaving away in the Wakey-Wakey warehouse. Even now I curse myself for dismissing the former. Surely getting crushed to death in a coal mine would have granted me a much more merciful sleep than this living hell. I would’ve been happier with the miserable pay, on the side writing miserable little Reddit stories for the remainder of my miserable little life. I wish I was writing one now. Not a warning.

The pay at Wakey-Wakey was just above miserable and well below livable. In short, it made a shitty life in a shithole town bearable. It was enough dough to roll your wheels to the bar, the mountains and Dollar General when you needed several Cups of Noodles for your weekly nutritional maintenance. The top gourmet shit that burned you for your impatience. It’s what the deadends took up for a living—that and the few meager government benefits you can be offered to compensate for the bearable. As a deadend myself, I take the title as fact of zipcode, not a judgment of character. I’m not some high-and-mighty asshole. I’ve read Marx. 

It was the first real job I had outside of shoveling driveways and mowing lawns. In my last year of high school, as society across the world tried to reassemble itself from the initial disarray caused by Covid, our district had partnered up with local businesses in an effort to reabsorb the lost labor force while bolstering the next generation of team-players. The position—freight handler—caught my eye. It appealed to my anti-social tendencies, was just up the hill from my house and even doubled as exercise. Like many young men, I grew obsessed with looking jacked as fuck to intimidate and seduce others. But I didn’t want to go to the local gym. Anti-social tendencies. It also served to pry my mother off my back, my mother who reminded me every half hour without fail that Brian had a job as an Amazon deliveryman. Brian was a kid I used to hangout with in middle school briefly. He stole my rare Lego Star Wars minifigures and called me a faggot when I called him out on it. Fuck Brian. 

I still had friends, though. I wasn’t some unlikable asshole. I just tended to be a distant person, so naturally my relationships were distant. That’s why none of my childhood friends knew about my employment (and the nightmare that soon succeeded the fleeting joy of purpose) until later. It was just a coincidence that none of them ended up working there. They either were busy with the college prep, a trade school or community college a county over, or the hole in the ground. Isolation used to soothe me. But despite this, I still made enough conversation and feigned enough social confidence to make acquaintances at work. But then again, the warehouse attracted most people wanting to shun a public life. It’s what attracted me, after all. 

My 4 3/4 year tenure at Wakey-Wakey started on a wet day in late April. Stepping out onto the stoop that day, I could see the eyes of the warehouse anticipating me as they always seemed to. You see, that was part of the company logo that jutted up from that oddly shaped lunchbox of a tomb. The mascot, modeled after the founder of the borough. Harold “Harbinger” Wakefield. A cartoon man in an old suit with a handlebar mustache, a middle-part, oval eyes unlidded at the top for wakeful emphasis, a big rusted toothy smile and a creaking arm with a cup of coffee going up and down. As I got closer and closer to the building, I noticed what could’ve been coffee stains on the cuff of the arm or more rust. I still don’t know whichever it was. And now I never will. Thank god. 

HR was a tower of Babylon in the midst of the shadows of the shouting of both man and machinery. I had to raise my voice several times before the wrinkled secretary heard me. *“My name’s Larry Caraway! I’m here for an interview!”*

“Oh!” she said at a normal volume. She brightened, her blood neon under her clay makeup and gray flesh. I could barely hear her, had to follow her lips. She pushed herself and sailed across her office in her chair to an old phone. “Let me call Davey for you!”

The wait for Davey wasn’t long. He came bouncing down the steps from the highest office in the tower in his Air Jordans, a sunbeam gleaming from his wristwatch initially blinding the rest of him from me, but on the floor in the shadows in front of me, I saw him clear as day. Beyond the Jordans and the wristwatch (Rolex, I think?), he wore tall socks, long cargo shorts and a black polo shirt. He was tall, tan, balding and blue-eyed, his smile as wide as Wakefield’s just outside but thankfully human and cleaner, albeit very expensive looking. He held out a large hand, and I found his grip to be as blinding as the sunbeam. But I smiled right back at him as he (thankfully) shouted above the noise, *“Hello, Larry! Thank’s for coming today. It’s fine if I call you Larry, right?”*

I affirmed him as we started to walk through the open portal to our left into a broader section of the warehouse. The large metal door hung above us like a guillotine blade as we crossed the black and yellow caution. The lights were so high up that their cast was low, so it gave the associates and the forklifts the appearance of things scattering and prowling in the dark.

Davey, making corresponding gestures with his fingers, said, *“This’ll be a walk and talk interview for the most part, just so you can get the gist of what you’ll be doing on the daily, and so you can also ask for any specifics on the spot! Sound good?”*

I gave him a thumbs up and we got got rolling. He maintained his volume, so I only had to ask him to repeat something once or twice. The job seemed easy enough—loading and unloading various trailers that were docked with conveyor belts, and pallet jacks with wooden pallets to balance boxes of stock on. Most of the stock was various roasts and flavors of coffee grounds, though we also shipped partnered products like Hamilton Beach coffee makers or hand-held French presses—and company branded merchandise as well, of course. The stock seemed neverending, tower after tower of tightly wrapped skids transformed into walls of trenches and valleys. Forklifts and high capacity reach trucks played a delicate game of Jenga with the towers, the appendages of an industrial god constantly managing its cathedral of Theseus. 

The immensity of the place astounded me. Not just the physical scale, but chiefly the economic importance of the operation. Our product quite literally fueled the broader workforce. I knew about our few physical café locations sprinkled about the county and the grounds being sold in stores and online, but I had no idea how many *other* companies used our grounds. Not just small businesses, but the *big* chains. Whatever comes off the top of your head probably repackaged our product to some capacity. I wonder how much they have left. They’ll run out soon enough. I still don’t know if that’s a blessing or a curse, after all that’s happened. Even now, Davey’s words haunt me. I close my eyes and I see us up on deck where the conveyor system was managed, phantoms in the darkness, his left arm spread towards the show below us, the endless rows and roars of trailers and the docking bays on the outskirts of the trenches. He laughed and said, *“We ship the blood through the veins!”*

On the microscopic levels of that grand chain of commerce were the freight handlers. The only biological life in the whole ecosystem, dwarfed by their tools. Except for the scan guns, clunky as they were. They were what we used to track stock (and employee) movement in our system, and had functions for various tasks that could net you extra money. Without their batteries though, the only practical use for them was bludgeoning. On the day of the tour, the floor was calm enough despite multiple people frustratingly fiddling with their scan guns. The most exciting part of the tour was Davey cursing out a forklift driver for smoking, reading him the riot act. The driver was apologetic enough, and got off with a warning, though I got the sense they had all done this before.

The weirdest part of the tour was the last part of it before we finished up in Davey’s office. When we stopped in the basement. Or rather, lingered on the wide concrete steps leading down to it, lip of its ceiling obscuring a complete view of it. Though I couldn’t see the light, it bathed the room in a Halloween glow. It had a cracked tile floor, backless wooden benches with metal legs and tall lockers lined up against the walls. Except for one that appeared to have fallen over and been dragged towards the center. 

As he stared into the basement—notably two steps behind me—Davey’s whole attitude was completely different. His smile didn’t hold at all. Though he maintained his HR lilt, the man was pensive. His arm subtly wavered as he gestured to the dungeon. And he was quieter, too. But the babel of the warehouse seemed to grant him this pause, as I heard him clear as day. “This is a storage area for extra equipment. I would ask your shift manager to scrounge something up for you first though, if you really need it.”

I looked back at him, catching the quick replastering of his smile. “Why’s that?”

He semi-crossed his arms, flapping the loose hand as he curled his mouth to a neutral, matter-of-fact expression. “That’s what they’re there for, and this is a little out of the way, is all. And the night owls—third shift—store their stuff here, and if they find it misplaced they’re liable to get pretty cranky. So I’d just save the heartache and the hassle and just get your shift manager to help you.”

“Oh,” I said, looking back into the basement. “Okay.”

He put his foot on the next step above him, signaling for both of us to ascend. “And if you hear any noise coming from down there… just ignore it, okay Larry? It’s probably nothing serious. Some guys just like to blow off steam in private, is all.”

I pointed to the locker in the center of the room. “Is that what that locker was? Somebody blowing off steam?”

His eyes followed my finger, his pupils becoming pinpoints at the sight of the odd metal casket. For a minute, I thought he was going to scream. But he shook his head, laughed, said, *“Probably!”*

I have sold many handmade things before tried so so many different crafts over the years. But I'm very passionate about silver jewellery and wanted to give it a go! I hope that I can start with sliver clay pieces gradually make some money and eventually afford the equipment to learn traditional silversmithing techniques too! With silver costing more and more which is difficult for me on my low wage I am gutted that I have wasted so much clay on broken pieces! (I don't know how or have the means to burn the broken metal down) Aside from the monetary cost I have put hours upon hours into sculpting my pieces and it's becoming heartbreaking when they brake. When my first pieces broke I thought I am not firing them for long enough I was keeping them a  light red colour with a torch for 3/4 minuets like instructions had told me. When I wire brush the pieces they look silver but then they crack and break 💔 I started firing for much longer still the same problem! Then I thought maybe I'm not leaving my pieces to dry long enough! So I have been leaving them a few days to dry...still break 💔 I have purchased a coffee mug warmer that I read can help dry the pieces I have used that on my latest piece rotated every now and again left for two days to dry some time on the warmer and sometime just air drying, I have fired it for almost 15 minutes with my torch and thought this is it fail safe extra drying time warmer drying and extra firing time! Again the piece has just snapped 😭 Its a good brand of clay it's expensive I have swapped my torch also I can only think that maybe my torch isn't hot enough? But I have swapped from a kitchen torch to a more expensive torch for DIY etc. What could be going wrong??? What can I do with all my broken pieces to claim some money back?

I use the same grind setting for a single dose 1-pour V60 (15g/250ml, 18g/300ml) & I don't know how to enjoy a moka ground at 2.0 or as low as 1.0, as some people on here suggest. I do get a little FOMO about an experience or a brewing technique I'm not aware of that would be suitable for finer settings. Even though I did find my sweet spot, as it seems.

So, am I just used to V60 so much it hinders my ability to enjoy a *proper* moka pot? Do I do something in a weird way?

# Clarification

* I use quite soft, filtered tap water; I change the carbon filter in my pitcher every 30 days or so.
* My general preference is fruity, lower-end specialty light roasts in V60 + cafec filters but I do enjoy a chocolaty moka pot, too. Acidic-forward espresso is a bit much for me but I dabble.
* My coffee's always fresh - at most a couple of months, excluding a bag of Arcaffe Moka Crema that's at 10 months but still tastes pleasant. No pre-ground.
* My grinder is Fellow Ode 2 with basic Fellow Ode 2 burrs. I calibrate and clean it thoroughly every month/month and a half.
* To provide the measurements in microns, I used [Honest Coffee Guide](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/fellow-ode-brew-grinder-gen-2-grind-settings/).
* I know that taste is subjective & I might just have found my sweet spot. I do go by *if it ain't broke don't fix it* *though* ***do*** *experiment with it.*

# Brewing

* 3 cup alluminum G.A.T Diva with steel bottom.
* Gas oven.
* 18g coffee & 170ml 96C water in (right under the valve).
* 4-6min of heating on medium flame till the coffee starts flowing out.
* Then 110-120g of brew come out slowly and steadily in up to 4 minutes on the lowest flame.

Note: I even stack three burner grates on top of each other over the flame so that the amount of heat is *just right;* I did check - it **is** stable.

# ""Looks too coarse""

I keep seeing recommendations to grind really fine for moka pot - [at 2.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1g20347/comment/lrnwr17) (360 microns), [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1g20347/comment/mc4s8qy/) and [others](https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1f9ct20/comment/mc4t1ma) say 1.0 (260 microns) for dark roasts. It occurs often when someone shows that their grind size looks coarse [(see newer comments in this thread)](http://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1f9ct20), suitable for a single cup pour over. Which looks as coarse as I would grind according to my preference. So I tried going finer.

# ""What, you don't like finely ground coffee? Tell me Michael, how could a billion Reddit users be wrong?""

At first I used a Colombian sugarcane decaf roasted for espresso. At 4.0 (540 microns) it tasted quite acidic & had a chocolaty-fudgy sweetness. I tried going finer and finer every 2 clicks till I reached 2.0 (360 microns) but it kept getting more harsh and less sweet. Both the acidity and bitterness started getting a bit overwhelming at the end, I noticed a harshness like the acidity was too much for me to handle and stinged the back of my throat. Off metallic notes started appearing in the aftertaste.

I just opened a bag of something more traditional yesterday, Arcaffe Moka Crema. At 4.0 it's just balanced sweeteness reminding me of dark 80%+ chocolate with vanilla & just a hint of acidity; maybe some black candy or anise in the background. I tried going finer today - at 3.2 (abt. 508 microns) I noticed right off the bat it got somewhat worse. To be frank, I did not drink the whole cup straight but with milk which covered up any off flavors very well, so I'll try it black again at 3.2 setting to see if I does anything to improve the brew.

I even tried brewing an Ethiopian light roast (meant for pour-over) and it turned out palatable, maybe even pleasant, at 4.0. Very much a sour-bomb with hints of black tea. Below 4.0 it only got worse the finer I got. At 3.1/2.2 it felt as if my body wanted to reject what I just drank in a similar (but less intense) way a very spicy meal might make you a bit lightheaded.

So.

Does it all just come down to preference? Or am I missing something?

INB4: yeah, I know what I wrote, of course I mean **the moka pot itself** tastes best ground at 4.0. The cronchy aluminum bits are my favorite. **/j**",0,1763322711.0,mokapot,0,0.5,False

**Snippet Part 1:**

* A YORK (UK) woman who spent more than two decades on the streets is now helping homeless people in the city through numerous local charities.
* Mary Haggerty, 60, had lived on and off the streets for more than 20 years before she boarded a train from Leeds to York six years ago.
* Exhausted and needing a fresh start, she recalls telling herself that she would get off at the first stop and start anew.
* She explained: “I came to York with nothing – not knowing anyone, with no money and no plan.
* “I slept in the doorway of M&S on the first night.
* “And when I woke up the next morning, it was to a guy from the Samaritans, who made me laugh after I asked him who he was – telling me he was the best-looking man in York.”
* The volunteer signposted Mary to Carecent – a centre at the Central Methodist Church which supports socially excluded and homeless communities in York – for a free breakfast.
* **She said: “I desperately needed that support back then.**
* “I was able to get it – not just from Carecent, but from those at the Key Project, the Never Give Up Group and Hoping Street Kitchen.” 'These charities fed me when I was homeless - it was time to give back'
* Mary praises these local charities for helping her get back on her feet – allowing her to find new ways of coping through internal struggles and alcohol dependency.
* **She said: “After a while, I realised that I wanted to help out. “One charity asked me if I knew how to make a cup of tea and coffee – I jumped in, and I’ve been volunteering ever since.”**
* Mary has used her natural warmth and compassion to reach out to the homeless in York – becoming a bridge between them and the organisations wanting to help.

Save up on coffee for like a few decades and you might become a millionaire kinda mentality, which is an obvious BS if you misuse it, but everything is BS if you misuse it - but that's not the main point of the story

I embraced inconsistency to become extremely fluid and plastic and gelatin like as a highly caffeine sipping productivity lizard chameleon lurking in the shadows with a poisoned dagger while all of you are sleeping - bit absurd, but just be inconsistent and be totally, radically, openly okay about it 

I recently opened my ""second brain"" they call it, and wrote a few lines there, and turns out it's an immersive experience, note typing, and then it turned into a few paragraphs, and without even naming stuff, creating a link to a database or whatever the mysterious words you are reading here, I just quit, and went on to drink my coffee, half to it an idea to exercise came up, I did just that, and without even finishing, I went to answer a phone, after than sat on to play a guitar, and after one song the break on my ""job"" has ended and now was the time for the main #1 task and ra rah 

A thing is, now it's the opposite of my past, instead of worrying about the future mistakes, little inconsistencies to an OCD level, I have turned to be someone who's ADHD like careless about all this bullshit, and now it's just pure fun, and it's totally okay, and as a spiritual note - wise are those who are same both in pleasure in pain - remember that, when a ship gets hyped up by the storms or strong wind, if you panic up and start worrying and ruminating, it eventually gets wrecked, but if you stay calm, you just smile, maybe throw up, and just change back to the main course - inconsistency is power, cause left or right, eventually with confidence, specifics behind and details forgotten and forbidden, you **know** that **eventually** you are gonna get something good out of whatever the F is happening, and oh, I no longer skip days, but if I do, which I did once with this mentality, I didn't give a dime's shit, I was just chilling, I skipped a few days **for fun** and didn't feel guilt or inadequacy, cause remember the shit, or sheep, ship metaphor, just stay calm, and change the course, and enjoy when the storm takes away your dear friend, cause who knows, maybe he will be taken away to the Valhalla

1oyv4x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MurricsContent/comments/1oyv4x0/from_driving_trucks_to_receptionist/,From driving trucks to receptionist.,"5 Years on the road as a truck driver. 5 Years is all it took to realize this is not the job I want to do anymore. No, it’s not because of family or friends, because don’t have any. You see, My mom and dad died in a car crash when I was 23. At the time I was working a dead end job and still living with my parents, but once they died, well, I had no way to pay the rent. Looking for higher paying jobs, I realized that being on the road could take care of my financial woes as well as my living situation. The first year was fun, I got to travel to country and see beautiful landscapes. Hell, I even managed to meet beautiful new people all across this great country of ours. Unfortunatly, time has a way of killing your honeymoon with jobs. There is only so much traffic I can sit in, onlyso many times of seeing the same scenery over and over. 5 years it what it took to get to that place. Now, it didnt hit me all at once, rather, it was a gradual process. Disbatch would send me to a place, the place would not have my load ready, I would have to sit for hours and hours just for the shipper to kick me off the yard as soon as I was loaded. Even atmidnight, when all the parking was full, they woul dnot care. Well, I had enough, because once day in rural and mountainous Hartford, Tennessee, while I was taking a 34 hour reset, I went to enjoy the local area. There didnt seem like much to do here except whitewater rafting and alcohol, which to be honest, seems like a risky combo, but who am I to judge. Anyways, I got hungry, and seeing how I didnt want to be sitting in my truck all day, I quickly pulled out my phone to see if there were any places to eat around me, one, one place. It was a small outdoors cafe called Beantrees Cafe. “Well” I said to myself, “Its only a short walk from where I am, might as well enjoy the nature”. So I got out of my truck and walked a short distance. I had to cross over I-45 to get to it, but it wasnt busy, no traffic this day. Once I got there, I ordered a burger, fries, and a coke, took my meal to a table overlooking a creek in the forest, and started to eat. “You are not from around here, are yeh?” I heard the shakey voice of an older woman from the next table over. “Ma’am?” I asked as I looked up. “You are not from around here, are yeh?” “No ma’am, im a truck driver on my 34 reset. I thought I would enjoy your lovely town” “Oh, he he he” she said in her raspy voice as she started to cough “excuse me” getting hersef composed, she continued “How long have you been trucking for?” “5 years” “do you like it?” “I used to, but now it just feels like a chore. Hurry up and go here, hurry, hurry, hurry, now once you are there, you must wait, wait, wait, 6 hours later and still wait. After a while, that hurry up and wait lifestyle gets old.” “I can see what you mean darling, have you ever thought of setteling down somewhere?” “Actually, yes, I have been trying to find the right place to call home, a place that is not too busy and not to slow, a place I can find a job as well” “Oh, my, well what do you thing about our small little town?” I took another bite of my burger and slowly chewing, pondering her qestion. Swalling and then taking a sip of my drink, I replied, “From what I can see, its a lovely place. I have always loved the small mountain towns like this. Plus, I hear you can buy lots of land for fairly cheap in smaller towns.” “Yes, yes, you can if you find the right place. I tell you what, when do you go back out on the road?” “Tomorrow, but I was thinking aboutpushing it back a day, so I can experience this town some more.” “I will tell you, there is not much to do, but I can always use some help in the resort up the road. Its not much, but an older lady like myself can use all the help I can get. Do you like working overnights?” “Yes maam, I only typically run at night, less traffic I found.” “ok, well if you want, travel to Smokey mountain resort tonight at 6pm, I will pay you for your time. Who knows, if you like it, the simple life, you might just want to stay.” “I nodded my head and bit down at my burger as I finished it. “Well, I guess I will see you there, if I want to do it, I have to get some sleep to be well rested.”  

 

 

As I approached the resort, I noticed it was a tiny place. 1 long wooden building that actually seemed like a 2 star motel. There was only 3 entrances, one on the front and one on both sides of the building. The 2 side doors looked like they were heavy steal and the main door was wooden. 4 windows lined the front facing side of the building, 2 on each side of the door. “this is an odd looking place” I thought to myself. 

 

There are \*rules to this place, you must follow them without fail and in order without deviation. If you dont, you will upset the...” she paused, “the guests” 

 

Rule 1. At 8pm, you must lock the main door. 

Rule 2. You must light the candle 

Rule 3. You must turn of the lights, all the lights, no exceptions. The candle you lit will be your light source 

Rule 4. Go to the kitchen and place cookie doe from the fridge on a pan and put it in the heated oven. 

Rule 5. While that is cooking, make 2 fresh pots of coffee. 1 pot will be 3 scoops of mild roast, brew in green pot. The blue pot, is 5 scoops of dark roast. Whatever you do, DO NOT MIX THESE UP!!! FOLLOW THE EXACT SCOOPS AND COLORS!!! 

Rule 6. Go to all the rooms and start running hot baths. Do not add cold water, just pure hot water. If you think its too hot, believe me, its not. 

Rule 7. once these things are done, pull the cookies out of the oven. If you do all of these thing in that order in a timely manner, the cookies should be beautifully baked. Place cookies on the stove top. Make sure there is something between the oven and the tray of cookies, do not place hot tray on oven, trust me on this. After you let them sit for exactly 20 minutes, place them, one at a time, on to a plate and set on the table by the front door. 

Rule 8. Place milk from fridge and set on table by front door. 

Rule 9. LEAVE COFFEE IN KITCHEN 

Rule 10. Place candle in window and let sit for EXACTLY 5 minutes. 

Rule 11. Turn on all the lights and unlock door.  

Rule 12. This is most important, do not deviate from this. Do not make small talk with the guests, do not look at them longer than needed, no eye contact, no over examination of their features. Just check them in, tend to their needs and you will be fine.

So my (26 F) husband (32 M) has 2 friends who are exes. My husband and I have been together over 2 years. One of his exes, we’ll call her Anne, is 33, married, and they dated over 10 years ago. from all accounts, they weren’t really super into each other, dated for maybe a year, broke up, and reconnected as friends a few years later. all good, nothing crazy. she lives a bit away from us, so he introduced me to her over the phone several times when we first started dating. her husband is great, I really like her too, and we’ve even stayed at their house a number of times. I really appreciate my husband’s efforts to introduce me to her early on and make me comfortable. my husbands job is one that is kind of woman heavy, and he travels, and has even shared air bnb’s with other women before. but like always has tried to make me really comfortable and I’ve met most of the girls, either over FaceTime, and they usually have partners too, and truthfully, I’m a really jealous person so the fact that I could be comfortable with this truly means it’s ok. then there’s his other ex that Hes friends with, Kyla (36 F). since the beginning of our relationship, I’ve just felt some oddness with her. she and my husband dated for 3+ years, living together even from the start. she lived in the same exact city as us (unlike his other friends/ex who are women) and I didn’t meet her like the other women. he hung out with her a bit and would talk to her too. nothing crazy, I will give him that, and when I’ve set boundaries he meets them. but for me, there was no talking to her on the phone, and I didn’t meet her until a few days after we were married when we accidentally bumped into her at a coffee shop. I was so uncomfortable, his family was there, and they all (including the ex) speak a different language than me, so I had to navigate those feelings. i won’t get into everything, but the fact that it felt like she was kind of being kept away from me because of her uncomfortability felt… yucky. and, once I asked my husband to be truthfully honest with me, and she said he’d consider her a best friend, if not THE best friend of his. so recently, he traveled for work again, and was in the same city as her. they only hung out together with another person, but she bought him a $250 cologne. the same cologne that Hes almost out of that she bought him when they were together. he tried to hide it from me at first but quickly just told me the truth and that he was sorry. apparently it was a late birthday gift. he said he would put more distance between then. then, today, he just got back from more work (not in the same city as her though) and I looked at his texts (i know I shouldnt, that’s another issue). there were 14 messages he deleted from her. I looked at them - Theyre kind of flirty and teasing and I think related to something they were talking about on the phone. not super flirty, but just teasing in a familiar way. I just. im so sick of these horrible jealous feelings I get when there’s no evidence that anything is going on, just little things that all add up to me being jealous and feeling like shit. First, I know I shouldnt look at this phone. but how do you guys decide to just trust your partner? have you been in situations where an ex was involved? I’d like to hear experiences. 

  
TLDR: my (26f) husband (32m) is friends with an ex (36f) that makes me extremely jealous and uncomfortable because little things that have all added up, including not introducing us until after he and I were married, her buying him a $250 cologne, and him deleting texts from her.

1oyv4cc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1oyv4cc/blood_river_pt1/,Blood River PT1,"Cramped, sweaty, and in the dark is just the perfect place to be, the perfect place to bash your hand into a broken pipe for the thousandth time



A misfortune for just about anyone who wasn't a masochist or sadist



Jack thought this to himself as he fixed the same corroded pipe that the Newburn Athletic Center or NAC for short didnt want to spend money on fixing right



Regardless of how much the NAC brought in every season, he was always brought in to fix this same damn pipe



“Sometimes I really wish to quit, but who else would volunteer to hear excrement and chlorine rummage through aluminum pipes all day”



Jack’s dark brown eyes squinting to see if he fully sealed the burst or if it was another one of those false hopes his rough hands always seemed to cling onto



Lodging the last bolt into place, and making sure the aluminum wouldn't spout hot water all over him again, he made his way through the tight shiny backrooms of his least favorite sport center



Even with the heat of the pipes, Jack’s wet dark charcoal uniform coated his bones in an uncomfortable chill, the greyscale of his current world decreasing any sense of warmth he had when entering this place



Every now and again he would catch his reflection, an amorphous black mess of tendrils moving about his skin. Anyone who didn't know better would think he had a very imaginative set of intricate tattoos sunk into his flesh



Just another reminder of his affliction Jack tries to drown out by working in environments as stuffy and dark as this one



Tools clanking, sounds reverberating against the metallic organs surrounding him raising over 20 feet above his head. The artificial heartbeat clunking along happily after its latest checkup



There was no wall nor floor nor ceiling here that was bare of steel alloys or aluminum striping, the many pipes a reminder of possible arteries that could burst and bring Jack right back to his sweaty dominion



The charcoal pigmented uniform temporarily stained black by his advantageous job, sticks tightly to his broad frame as he surveys and checks off each system on a slightly cracked clipboard with rust starting to form on the clip



“Please let this be the last time I come back this summer” he exclaims as his black blobs form frown emojis across his arms, a reminder that Jack isn't the only thing that has an opinion around these parts



Swatting away any opinionated tainted flesh, he sets down the clipboard with a light clatter echoing into the darkness 



The broody contractor stares at his hand one last time as a little black tendril wraps around his pen, slowly caressing it as to say you need me as much as you need this



Ideas flow across Jack’s mind until he spits them out and grabs the rest of his shiny gear before stomping out of the quarters he finds himself so often in



Walking out of the organs of the NAC, his eyes took a moment to adjust to the sparkling bright welcome center around him. His outfit is a reminder that he cannot stagnate, for fear of getting cold in this artificial climate. 



“Agh, I need to stop spending so much time bent over. My body is getting the wrong idea” Jack gasped with a grimace



Taking but a moment to stretch and assess his surroundings, just to make sure everything is the same as it was two hours ago. White epoxy flooring stretches out in front of him, specks and spackles of black and red float in the white as if they were blood cells in a petri dish. A horror of a welcome desk sits to his right, signs and tablets sprawl its surface while two superficially sweet attendants stand at attention, for anyone who needs a kind of “Human guidance.”



A doorway into a darker, computer room looms in front of him a good 50 feet away, between the computer room and the welcome desk is the entrance to the rest of the athletic center. Opaque glass stopping anyone from seeing into, or out of the halls that lie after it. 



Finally, to Jack’s left, there are the doors to the center itself, vinyl wrapping along its massive glass wall making it hard to see through. A warble of red, black, and white fly across the vinyl in an attempt to look appetizing. Two large fans stand guard over the doors, blasting anyone that walks through with winterized air while wearing a sneer of folding metal.



Everything seemed normal, as it was when he came in. No drastic changes, no skyfall, no busted glass. Normal.

Picking up his canvas bags, filled with miscellaneous tools and trinkets specific to his work. A chill runs up and down his spine, the black tar on his skin spiking out, as if it was ferrofluid contained within his flesh. Just for a moment, his entire body lit up like a skyscraper in a thunderstorm during Humanity’s darkest night. 

Dark clouds perforated the sky, small signals of a hungry storm ready to devour him.

“Ah screw off, first the pipe now a storm? Its like the universe is trying to keep me miserable.” Before Jack could finish lamenting his sorry existence, an NAC employee with a head of fire and the bubbliest personality to match came half strolling, half skipping over.

“What, you don't like the rain Mr Man, you can fix pipes but you can't fix your attitude?”

“That's two more questions than I allocated to any conversation with someone today Carly, also what's with the Mr Man thing? A little depreciating don't you think?” Jack retorted as he looked the only tolerable NAC employee up and down, noticing her controversial fashion choices.

Bright pink crocs with smoothie and wave gibbets covering the holes, little clothespins littering the stitching around her pockets. Each clothespin a different color of the rainbow. Her NAC uniform a tan with burnt orange stripes on either side like a runway strip. The airplanes landing having to dodge her ten buttons, closed together all the way to her neck. Around the collar there is a black cord necklace with an amethyst pendant held on by wire encircling it. A dark purple orb calling out to whomever dares look at it. Her face is symmetrical like a baby, full cheeks constantly rosy with eyes staring at Jack reminiscent of a red panda. Hints of brown encased by green swirl in her irises, and to finish her outstanding presence, a bonfire of frizzy red hair sits atop her crown. 

“Mr Man is a lot better than what the other employees call you, would you rather me call you grumbles instead?”“Don't overstep your bounds, fire princess, for now Mr Man will do.”

“Right right, well I would love to chat with you more but that storm seems to catch your attention more than I do, must be pretty alluring. Lets not turn this into a sob story where I clutch my pearls asking why another handyman is replacing you after an oh so terrible accident happened.”

“Ill ignore that comment, but no I must take my leave. I shall see you next time this place needs her surgeon.”

Taking a deep breath, Jack begins to walk towards the mouth of this place, the glass distorting any hope of a clear drive home.

“Don't forget about me now, OH WAIT” Just as Jack opened the door, Carly ran up to him and shoved a sticky note in one of his bags. A little cinder of hope radiating from it, terrified that Jack would throw it away, and hoping he would honor it.

“What was that?”

“SHHHH, you need to go remember”

“Yeah I do, May I crash and die before I get home if the universe cares for my wishes”

Carly scoffs as Jack closes the door and walks to his car, the first solace of a quiet night. But just as he enters the soft cream interior, the dark blue paint begins to sparkle with rain drops. 

“Shit, shit shit shit”

Popping the four door Subaru into drive, he scrambled out of the parking lot and onto the road. Slowly Jack made progress on his way home. The black pools on his flesh spiking every few seconds, just as they did a flash of lightning hit. 

“I know, this is bad. I need to get home and this traffic is not helping”

Almost as a confirmation, the designs on his skin formed into thumbs up and a multitudes of worried emojis. Each flash of light seems to grow closer and brighter with each clap of thunder.

Ten second intervals, then it became seven

“7 miles to go, nearly there”

Seven became five

“Just four miles, please let this be a normal storm”

The sky turning from a pale grey into an over encompassing dark hue of orange as the sun hits the clouds just right

Five became three seconds

“I'm just down the road, please let me get there”

The storm was on top of him, swarming over his car as if it knew he was in there. Tendrils of wind pushed the car side to side. A siren off in the distance lets out. Jack is turning into his driveway now, but there was little he could do as a funnel opened over him. The winds created a sound, something akin to laughing.

It saw him. It sees him.

The light from the dying sun reflected off Jack's back mirror, combining with the darkness of the clouds into what could only be described as a figure standing above the car. 

It was smiling.

Lightning was a constant, concentrating into veins within the unholy spirit. Staring and smiling at Jack as its form becomes complete. Floating in the center of the descending funnel.

Jack's flesh was spiking out now, his entire right side from his toes to his shoulder looked like tar covered porcupine. 

“You always find a way to find me, don't you fucker.”

The figure of the storm leapt out at Jack, fibers of the storm reaching out to him, latching onto him and digging in. Blood began to dribble down his body, the cold dampness of the uniform becoming one with the blood. The air was freezing, deafening, and filled with light and darkness at the same time. 

Storm tendrils ripped Jack out of the car hungry for his tainted flesh, an unwanted invasion of his privacy that he was more annoyed at than scared of.

Jack waited until the creature touched his throat to act. With one swift motion, he slit his wrist up to his elbow with a knife he’d been hiding in his sleeve. The blade, the final gift his father ever gave to him, a golden edge with craters along the flat of its metal. In every other crater resided a purple jewel shining even in the darkest of places. The handle was black rubber with a full tang of golden alloy and a small spike on the pommel. 

“I hope I don't remember this in the morning” Jack thinks to himself, his thoughts barely audible over the sirens and wailing of the storm. 

The funnel has fully descended on him now, lifting him a few inches off the ground. His self-inflicted wound uses the current of the wind and leaks black blood into it, a now swirling pool of black and grey surrounds him as the creature begins to cry out. 

Jack spits in its face as the rippling cloud forming his aggressor lets go and begins to choke on Jack's blood. His eyes roll back as he loses consciousness, slumping down as the final thing to leave is the dissipating cackle of the demon, and the siren flowering into the evening air. 

“Get up Jack, Get up Jack!” A little girl runs into Jack’s view as he blinks away color spots in his eyes. She is followed by a boy slightly taller than her. Jack finds himself in a yard covered with short grass fenced off by a large white building on one side, and the other an expansive forest. He began to feel the pain in his leg, piercing and terrible. 

“What the hell? Where am-” Jack was interrupted by both the girl and the boy grabbing him and lurching him on his feet, his right leg now a mess of white and black. He could see pieces of his leg where it looked as if a predator bit in and gnashed against his bones. Jack was light headed, and fading fast.

“Dude we have to get your dad, we’ll catch the blame”

“We need to get him a doctor, he’s dying”

“We won't make it halfway through the doors with that thing behind us.”

“Jack won't make it two steps past the door if we don't get the doctors!”

Both the boy, and the girl are now covered in red and black. Jack’s shattered leg bleeds onto his company and the ground beneath him, a stark black deeper than any darkness seen before. The boy holding up his left arm is stringy, thin, and underweight. He has slightly sunken eyes that seem to stare into oblivion. He has no color in his irises, only black and white. He wears a white shirt with green stitching, the sitting spirals along his clothes forming an interconnected series of lines. Lines that are reminiscent of veins. His hair is a dark brunette, messy and unruly. He seems to be struggling under the weight of Jack. Holding up his right arm, is a smaller girl. She has glasses framing her yellow eyes, the iris is lumpy, almost as if it bleeds into the whites of her eyes. Her clothes are white with purple stitching, swirling around her body in a similar vein pattern as the boy.

“Guys What's going oooonnnnnnn” Jack's vision begins to blink out, his body was heavy, his mind was straying from any possible reasoning. Struggling to stay awake, he looks back before entering the building at the forest. Trees sway and crack as something makes its way towards them, growling emanates from the forest, a growl so ancient it spikes a fear untapped in Jack's DNA. Before Jack loses consciousness, two large horns made of the same darkness his blood comprises poke through the line of green. Connected to these emerges a head with seven eyes and a mouth with rows of fangs so dastardly they would purge hope in the strongest of hearts. Before the trio could see anymore, they lug the dying child through the door and close it as a blaring alarm sounds sending Jack back into the ether. 

“What a quiet night that was, I would have preferred Carly pissing on my bags over that any day.” 

Jack found himself in his modest bedroom. Faint yellow walls only interrupted by a closet door and the door to the rest of his home. He tries to sit up on his dark grey sheets folding his blanket over his legs. But when he put any weight on his right arm, he remembered what happened the night before. A large black line extending from his wrist to his elbow gleams in the lowlight generously given by the sliver in between the curtains. The black line begins to close slowly as Jack acknowledges it. 

“I hope I closed my car door before that shit happened.” stumbling out of his bedroom, he found his way to the front door. Every step was painful, but paying for new tools would be even worse for him.

“I always wanted piercings, but not like this.”

When he eventually made it to his car, he pulled open the door. With a struggle, he brought in his tools, along with the little sticky note Carly gave him before he left. Setting the bags down on a wooden coffee table, he sat down slumping himself over on a leather couch. The windows brought in enough light to see the details of his appliances, the marble countertops, the yellow walls, and the note intimidating him. 

“If I invite that thing back, it may finish the job so I don't have to look at that.” But Jack wanted to deep down, he wanted to know what Carly thought of him. Regardless of what she thought, none of it would matter due to her mortality. 

‘Maybe I’m just overthinking it, maybe my boring aesthetic is working”

“She can't like me, it'll end up killing her.” Jack thought, but against the grumble inside his heart, he picked up the note and read it.

“Dear Mr Man, or Grumbles, if you'd ever like to see me in anything besides the NAC uniform. Let me know, I would love to see you sometime in something other than your broody outfit.” 

At the bottom is read “P.S. You can be all  mysterious for as long as you want, but I see the way your eyes light up when you look around for me at the end of your shift. If I'm wrong then ignore this, but if I'm right, text me here.”

Below her testimony of hopefulness lay a phone number and a smiley face, the cinders in the note becoming a campfire of hope as Jack's tar ridden flesh sticks out and waves at the number. Encouraging him, and egging him on to do it.

“Why”

“Just why”

“First I have to move next to that godforsaken place, secondly I have a coworker crushing on me, and third, I think I like them too.” 

Jack sat there, alone, with a slowly healing arm, and a note proclaiming a possible hint that someone notices him. His living room desolate, a tv on a small desk in front of him, a small couch he resides on, a wooden coffee table bridging the gap, and some windows to help liven up the space. No art, no paintings, no vase of flowers, nothing. Just yellow paint on the walls.

Looking at his phone for the first time today, he realizes it is 1 pm, the day has breached into the afternoon, and he hasn't eaten anything in over 24 hours.

“You think I could get her to go to lunch in such short notice?”

Confused and smiley faces pop up on his arms

“Yeah me too buddy, if I call her though and go to lunch you better behave this time”

Frowney faces stare at him

“I'll give you a lollipop later”

Smiley faces replace any doubt he had of support

Holding the note in his left hand, and his phone in his right, Jack texted Carly

“Hello Carly, no I didn't forget about you. I'll take you up on that offer if you'd like to go to lunch with me today”

“Yes I know it's a little late”

Before he is paralyzed with fear of socialization, Jack took his dirty blood covered body to his shower. An industrial strength soap works its way over his skin, complimenting the steel grey of the walls. The only sense of color is the pink shampoo bottle and blue bar of soap to make him smell somewhat presentable. The mirror is shattered slightly, held together by glue and dreams. A purple bathmat stands guard at the foot of his shower, an inset tub combo with a plastic curtain. The inside is slightly stained black, and a tinge of yellow for a sense of shame for his cleanliness standards.

“I really dug in hard this time huh”

Thumbs down emoji

“Yes yes I know it doesn't feel good for you either”

Eye roll emoji

“Don't give me sass, I didn't ask for you to be stuck in my veins.”

Angry emoji

“Hey you bring me bad luck pretty much every day, I could use yesterday as an example you pampered princess.”

A spike of black blood spurts out and sticks Jack in the side

“Fine fine I won't call you a pampered princess, just please stop sticking me. I'm going to look like a meth addict if you keep it up.”

A mixture of emojis too blurry to decipher run across his skin, yet ultimately it subsides and converges as a design of bridges and ladders around his closing wound. With this closure of discourse, Jack finishes washing himself of dirt, grease, and anything else unsavory he may have had stuck to him.

Walking out of the shower, his body tenses when he sees his phone vibrate from message over message being thrown into his mailbox like a spear finding purchase in a lamb's heart. Now mostly dry, he picks up his phone to read what Jack thinks very well might just be his demise.",1,1763322339.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I’ve always been a bit of a loner, I had some friends as a child, less as a teen and hardly any as an adult. I’ve missed out on a lot of stuff. I’ve also never had a boyfriend that truly loved me. My parents and family also don’t really love me (they’ve told me so) and I’m the black sheep. I found out a couple years ago that I have autism and I think that’s a big factor in my loneliness. 

I’m starting to understand that I will probably spend my life mostly alone. I’ll never have a friend group or get married or anything like that. I’ll always be the outsider. 

I’m just trying to think of ways to make my time in earth feel worth it. I try to do nice things for myself but I have an extremely low income and barely have any money left after paying the bills. I can just afford food and necessities and that’s it. If I get any additional bills, I struggle a lot to make it through the month, so it’s hard to do anything extra for myself. I try to cook for myself, keep my place clean, go outside, get coffee by myself, etc but it just doesn’t feel fun or nice or anything. I feel empty while I do it. I’m often reminded of the quote “happiness is only real when shared”. I feel like I’m reaching the end of my abilities to be alone. Yes I’m in therapy and have been for a long time so please don’t suggest that. 

How can I make my time on earth worth it or at least bearable? It hurts to be so alone. ",2,1763322290.0,lonely,3,0.75,False

1oyv2rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1oyv2rp/post_cruise_thoughts_star_princess/,Post Cruise Thoughts - Star Princess,"This Reddit was immensely helpful the last several months as I prepped for my first Princess cruise. I wanted to share my thoughts post our 5 day cruise on the Star Princess out of Miami to Amber Cove, DR and Grand Turk.  Feel free to scroll on if reviews aren't your thing! 

We stayed in a Sanctuary Mini Suite. It's the lowest tier room with access to the Sanctuary and comes with the Premier Package. It is not worth doing if traveling with kids imo, as kids aren't allowed in the Sanctuary Club and/or lounge. Having a designated pool and hot tub area with servers and a mini buffet they set up for lunch time was delightful - and the crew there was excellent.  The seperate dining room with the ability to just walk in without reservations was also nice. This is an upgrade we found worth it. 

Internet: worked well most of the time, but did have a couple times it went out. 

Ship layout: loved the overall layout of the Star. The one negative, and I overheard this from multiple guests - the casino that allowed smoking while actively playing is in the center of the ship next to the elevators and something you have to walk through. I get it, the casino is their money maker and if you say you have to actively be playing to smoke - you will get the smokers who don't want to walk all the way to the ends of the ship to smoke. However - often the  elevator area reeked of cigarette smoke wafting out of the casino. It is surprising they don't have stronger intake ventilation at the entrance and exits of the casino to minimize the smoke smell escaping. 

Food: we did specialty dining nightly. We reserved ours as soon as our cruise was paid off - but many with the premier and plus packages had a challenging time getting reservations at all. We did attempt on embarkation day to switch one of our reservations, and we're unable to. It was shocking - many we're unable to get any reservations even if they went straight to Maitre Ds upon boarding the boat. There were two conventions on our trip, and another passenger told me that they called her a few weeks before the cruise and tried to get her to change her dine time by 2 hours because the entire restaurant (I think it was Sabatinis) was being given over to convention guests for their meal at the same time. There was no release of any reservations when we got on the boat - I had read ahead of time that Princess holds half the reservations open until you board - but that was not the experience on this trip. 
As for the restaurants: we enjoyed Butchers Block. The aesthetic is much different than what we saw in videos of it on the Sun. Much higher end look. This restaurant is controversial - but we had an overall great time. The beef was delicious. However, itannoying that they didn't follow through with the reservations that were made for private tables vs being sat in a group.

Sabatinis: good, not anything unique though. 

Umai Hot Pot & Tepenyaki: we did both. The staff in this restaurant all have a camraderie that was evident. The Lemongrass broth for Hot Pot was so good. I would recommend either. 

Love By Britto: this has a stunning view that unfortunately is wasted for much of the time it is open because the sun has set. The portions were small - but as it was a 5 course meal, satisfying. Everything was really good and fun - all the little details were well thought out. They have increased the portion of their Cappuccino of Mushroom (mushroom soup), our server said it used to be like a shot glass size and they have switched it into a true coffee cup size. So good. This restaurant*feels* more upscale, it's separation from the other restaurants and ship activities lend it to feel more private and exclusive. Just know you will mostly have tiny portions. Their pistachio lamb chop was melt in your mouth good, and the lava cake delish. 

Everything else we had for breakfast and lunch was great. The disembarkation buffet surprised me as it wasn't as basic as I thought it would be - they had all the foods still including the MTO omelet bar. 

Drinks: we don't drink a lot of alcohol. It was disappointing that Princess has still not rolled out the mocktail menu they announced they would release by the Spring of 2025. It's been 5 months since the intended release date. We consistently only got 2 drink offers: ,Zero Mojito and a Key West cooler. A couple of times they included a daiquiri or Pina colada on the list. The key West cooler is delicious, but still sweet. A zero mojito is always gret. When so many restaurants here on land are expanding mocktail offerings  that aren't all sweet and are complex just like the flavor combinations for cocktails, I was honestly surprised how there was a lack of options. They didn't even know how to adapt already existing cocktails on their menus to be non-alcoholic and maintain flavor. 
 
I did try some alcoholic beverages - my favorite was Heart of Seoul in the Umai restaurant.

Ports: highly recommend the Waterfalls of Damajauga in Amber Cove. I missed the memo that the water shoes had to be closed toe - we took our water hiking sandals and had to rent water shoes for it. They do have lockers. Both the shoes and lockers rent for $10/ea, and the photo package was $55. The hike up is only challenging because it is vertical. If you are good with stairs/elevation shifts, you will be fine. Honestly one of the best experiences.

Snorkeling and manta rays in Grand Turk: we booked for the middle of the day for this, and I wish I had booked it first thing so we would have been able to more easily explore more than the port beaches and area. 

Entertainment:
 There was always a variety of options. I loved their illumination show. The silent disco was a blast, the candlelight concerts in the Dome were stunning. Game shows, Bingo, comedy, all of it was great. I was really impressed to the variety and frequency they had things going on all over the ship. It really made it so that it never felt like there were 4000 passengers. The Piazza is a genius design as well. Spreading everyone across multiple levels - it doesn't feel insanely packed.

Blood, gore, violence, kidnapping, etc. Long time Creep Cast fan finally joining the party and throwing my hat into the ring. Tell me how much it sucks.]

I have to tell you why I did it – why I became a killer. A murderer. The days before it happened I felt like I was just a kid - my future ahead of me with my last year of classes. If everything had gone according to plan I’d be a member of the Class of 1990. I split my time between school, working at a local deli shop as a butcher, and the near-campus home my parents had rented for me. I was so spoiled then – materially certainly but also spoiled with a certain innocence to how I viewed the world. That’s why what happened to me next so crushing, why my spirit was shattered. And that’s why I became the way that I did.

I’ll explain. I had my routine. Class, work, back to apartment. Like a clock you could set your time to when and where I would be – something that gave me structure and in this case lead to a series of unfortunate events. On my daily travels I frequently caught sight of a woman – new to the college but too old to be fresh out of high school – whose gaze would often follow me as I passed her in the hallways. Sometimes I would catch her staring at me in the lunchroom. But that’s not all; once or twice as I studied late in the library I would see her moving amongst the bookshelves, occasionally lingering, her dark hair visible and her face hidden by whatever tome might be on the shelf in front of her. Her persistence in being near me was surprising but there were a few times I “caught” her.  If and when in these moments our eyes ever locked I gave her a gentle smile which she should return with a blush and a timid smile of her own. You might ask why I didn’t ask her out or ask her what her deal was. Wrapped up in my studies, and my routine, I felt like I didn’t have time to pursue romance. And she seemed so very harmless. Still, I grew annoyed.

In those days you just didn’t complain about a pretty woman showing you a little too much attention – your male friends would never understand and your female friends might just roll their eyes. I had little of either, so I would complain to my parents during my weekly phone call and they offered suggestions like “talk to her” or “ask her to leave you alone” but I was too stubborn to admit that maybe they were right. And maybe I was too stubborn to admit I had a problem with confrontation.

One night, in the midst of a heavy downpour and while I was doing yet more homework for classes, I heard a knock at my door. And of course I answered it – I rarely had visitors because I was so wrapped up in academics and the butcher shop. I thought, at worst, it could be a friend of mine stopping by for a visit, not that I would expect any of them to, or maybe somebody got lost and needed directions. You know, something normal, typical, nonthreatening.

In fact normal is exactly what I thought until I opened the door and saw the same young woman standing there, soaked with rain, clothing sticking to her like a second set of skin. She gave me a faint smile, the gleam in her eyes almost obscured by the rain drops on her thick glasses.

“Hi,” she said,” my name is Emily.” So that’s who she was, after all this time. She initiated the conversation before me. Her voice was nervous, almost drowned out by the patter of rain on the road behind her. Her arms were wrapped around her midsection, water ran in rivulets down her body, pooling on my porch step. She looked so pathetic, so diminutive in her countenance I immediately felt sorry for her.

“Hi,” I said eyes flicking from her to the roadside and back,” I’m Ross. What brings you here? Can I help you with something?”

She nodded quickly, sending droplets of water everywhere from long dark hair. 

“Yes my car broke down a block away and you were the first house to answer my knocking.” She gazed deeply into my eyes as if expecting me to invite her in already. “Would it be possible for me to use your phone to call for a tow truck?”

I glanced her up and down and held up one finger to tell her to wait.

“I don’t want you tracking all that water in here and slipping on the floor. Give me one second – please.” I gave her a reassuring smile and disappeared briefly leaving her standing, no doubt shivering, on the porch step to get a towel. How sometimes I wish I had just closed the door.

I came back and she toweled herself off on the porch, wringing her long hair out with both hands sending a tiny stream of water to fall at her feet. Not that I meant to watch, but as she dragged the towel over her body she seemed to do so carefully over her legs and under her chest. She flicked a glance up at me once or twice to see if I was looking – I was – I enjoyed her little show. I averted my gaze but I’m sure she saw me, and if she didn’t, then she saw the way my cheeks turned red.

She inhaled sharply, a happy sound which made my ears were burn too. She handed me the towel and asked if she could come in. As I slung the damp towel over my shoulder I caught a faint whiff of cherry and vanilla.  I made a face at the strength of the smell and gestured inside wordlessly. She expectantly walked past me, kicked off her shoes the moment she entered, letting them bounce across the floor spitting drops of water everywhere. I frowned – the least she could have done was carefully slide them off.

Before I could say anything she was strolling around my living-room, looking at my meager decorations, smiling from ear to ear. She began touching the furniture like she owned it.

“Wow this is a really nice place. All for you? No roommates?”

“No,” I said, picking up her shoes and setting them near the door way. “It’s just me here.” I paused, not sure if the next part was going to be oversharing. “My parents didn’t want me having the typical college experience of sharing a room with some nut-job from Kentucky or something, so they’ve been renting this place for me for the past four years. I like it enough although sometimes I feel like I’m missing out. Like the need to keep after bills and whatever else happens when you’re on your own for real.”

She cooed: “You must feel so lonely sometimes. How fortunate, then, that I’m here tonight with you. That must be a little bit of a relief.” She gave me a playful wink as she continued her inventory.

She ran her hands delicately across my couch, dipping in between the spaces between pillows, seeking unexplored places. There was almost something sensual about it. I dismissed the thought – she was weird, sure, but she was probably enjoying not being in the freezing rain anymore. She moved towards my bookcase as if entranced.

“I get lonely but I don’t have to deal with people screaming in the hallways at night. It’s a peaceful life” I finally said,” if a little boring.”

“I thought you might read these kinds of books,” I thought I heard her say.

“Excuse me?”

“Oh you just seem like the type to read these books,” she said with a playful shrug, turning towards me. Her still damp hair whipped around to her back throwing a few droplets of water on my books.

“You’ve only ever seen me at the library studying?” I question.

She nodded enthusiastically.

“Sorry, you just seem like the type! You know, smart nerdy cute guy.” she turned back to exploring the book shelf eventually turning her attention to some of the nick-knacks I had set up on its shelves. Little figurines from my Dungeons and Dragons playing days – a hobby I had little time or inclination to engage in during my college years but nonetheless held a special place in my heart.

“I love these!” she gushed, picking up one of the warrior figures and turning it over in her hand. I watched as her un-careful handling broke the sword in the figure’s hand. Well, that was enough for me.

“Ok, Emily, listen,” I said,” it’s great that you do and I’m glad we’re finally having a conversation but your car is sitting a few blocks away broken down. The sooner you call them the sooner you can get back to poking around my stuff. So why don’t you call for the tow truck? The phone is in the kitchen. And please put that down.”

She tensed up momentarily, shoulders scrunching like she’d just been poked in the back. She stood up fully, smoothed her damp shirt with her hands. She turned to face me, expression neutral. Her gaze followed where my hand was pointing, more commanding than requesting, to the kitchen.

“Thank you for letting me use the phone,” she said coolly,” I appreciate you.”
 
I heard her make the phone call as I sat on my couch. She came across almost chipper as she confirmed the time she broke down and the location of the vehicle. She asked me for the number for my home, I told her it was written above the phone because hell if I knew after four years. Dispatch could call if the driver couldn’t find her. With that, she set the phone down kind of hard which made me jump a little.

“May I sit?” I heard her ask from behind me, her tone was pointed, sharp. 

“Sure, make yourself at home.” I said. I didn’t really mean it but I wasn’t going to kick her out either.

She sat on the sofa across from me, dust puffing into the air, a testament to how few visitors I had and how often I didn’t bother to vacuum. She crossed her legs and looked almost disappointed because I’d interrupted her explorations earlier.

“Sorry, I get a little curious sometimes,” she offered as an olive branch, “I like to get to know people based on the stuff they collect.”

“That’s fine,” I said,” just ask is all I’m saying. I thought you were just going to make the call and get back to business, so to speak.”

She glanced my way thoughtfully and then looked to the floor with a sheepish look.

“Well I can’t go back out in this rain while they get to my car. And you just seem like a person I want to get to know more about,” she replied, her voice small. “Is that a crime?”

She began to kick her leg into the air idly, the nervous energy finding a way out of her body, at my admonishment.  I felt a little bad -  she was likely having a bad day and just needed some normalcy.

“Don’t worry about it, can I get you some tea, Emily? Another towel? You still look damp.”

All questions I should have already asked her. I felt like a jerk, again.

Her face lit up at my suggestion.

“Both! Both is good!” she said cheerfully, her demeanor changing.

I left her once again in my living room, only to return within a few minutes to see her poking around with renewed vigor, wondering around the living room drinking in the sights. She grabbed one of the figures again, set it down, grabbed a book, flipped through some pages. Just what was she expecting to find? I cleared my throat, two mugs of tea in hand a dry towel hanging over my arm.

“Oh sorry I just couldn’t help myself,” she said sitting down again quickly.

“Yeah,” I said. “Here you go.”

She took the cup, blew on it, and slurped noisily. I handed her the towel which she gratefully applied to her damp clothes. She stood up, drying herself off, slowly sliding the towel over her body.

“So are you a student?” I asked careful not to stare this time.

She paused, towel placed strategically under her chest. She appeared to be thinking, perhaps delaying in case I took a moment to gaze at her too long.

“Yes! I’m studying to become a speech therapist. I want to help people speak better.”

I nodded, sipping at my own tea, my eyes going back to the floor.

“A noble idea.” I replied, giving her the benefit of the doubt. Because right now she was coming across as a harmless weirdo.

“Thank you! I only just started studying it this year so I don’t know a lot about it. I switched majors from criminology my sophomore year. Learning about societal deviants got a little too icky for me,” she said with an uncomfortable giggle,” I needed something more normal with less awful stories about crazy people.”

“Sure, sure,” I said,” I switched majors more than once. This is my last year. I can’t wait to be done with this class, work, study schedule. I need a year off. Or two.”

She sat back down and we chatted for what most have been an hour, covering all the usual topics like work, school, TV-shows we liked. I tried to keep it light, disconnected from the more personal details of my life. But the more we talked the more I realized she knew a lot about me and that her comments about my books and interest in the interior of my house seemed more than a coincidence. I mean, yes, she had been basically stalking me for half a year but the details about my parents, their wealth, my interests were all things she couldn’t have possibly known. Not before we talked for the first time today. Even more worryingly, my phone had yet to ring from the tow company. I struggled with taking this realization in and denied to myself that I was actually in any kind of danger. But I had to cross the threshold ask.

“Did you give them my number?” I asked suddenly.

“Who?” she said, giving me a stupid look, idly rolling the cold tea around in her cup. “I didn’t call anybody.” An electric shock ran through me.

“The tow company…” I said slowly, dreading the answer.

“Oh, yeah, them. Maybe they got lost.”

“They should have been here by now. Did you actually call them?” My voice was a mixture of annoyance and fear.

“You heard me talking to them.”

“I didn’t hear you give them my number, now that I think about it.  So what’s really going on...why are you here and why do you seem to know so much about me?”

She broke into a broad grin, her eyes gleaming. She sprang up from the couch and I jumped a little in my seat.

“Because I really like you! Ever since I saw you at the start of the last semester, you just seem like such a warm, generous man. I watched the way you talked to your professors and other students. Always kind, always smiling. Even if you keep to yourself, you just, I don’t know, seemed like the kind of man I’d like to be with.”

“So did your vehicle actually break down?” I asked, hands trembling. I set my cup of cold tea down before I dropped it to the floor. She gave me an intense look, her earlier nervousness now buried under layers of need.

“I actually called a friend and pretended they were the tow company. I really just wanted to be with you. After months of watching you I realized you were the one. The man I was meant to be with. Please don’t find it weird. You have to know that’s why I was always around you. I was too scared to say anything but I knew deep down. Our souls are bonded.”

She took small steps towards me, her arms splayed wide, half disarming half inviting. A happy tear rand own her cheek.

“We can be together now...”

I stood up, body trembling, face fixed with an angry look while a fearful tear fell to the floor. I felt like I was going to piss myself.

“Get out, right now. Leave. Jesus Christ, go before I call the cops.” I stabbed a finger at the door trying so hard to look like I was in control.

Her face dropped from the almost worshiping look she had been giving me to one of abject surprise.

“Wait I can explain…”

“Go!” She hesitated at my words. I grabbed her by the shoulder, hand like a vice, and shoved. She fell backwards, twisting to the side, catching herself with her arms.

She began sobbing and looked up at me, face obscured to with strands of long dark hair, freshly damp with tears.

“Please don’t do this. Give me a chance I can explain everything.” she crawled pitifully towards my feet and it was everything I could do to not kick her away from me.

“There isn’t an explanation you could give me that would satisfy anyone. Not even Jesus Christ himself and he was the most forgiving man to ever exist.” I felt silly making that comment but I hope it my point. I pointed again at the door for emphasis, hoping she would just listen and leave me alone.

She suddenly wrapped her arms around my legs, threatening to topple me over. Her grip was surprisingly strong and I idly wondered if I’d made yet another mistake shouting at her. She felt like she could overpower me. Yet she didn’t take my legs out from underneath me, she merely kept repeating the word “sorry” over and over again. I wrenched myself free, losing a shoe in the process.

“I’m calling the police. I warned you.” 

I made my way to the kitchen, leaving her on the floor, her sobs drifting in behind me. No sooner were my hands on the phone than I heard rapid footsteps behind me and I felt her crash in to me, slamming me against the wall, the receiver falling to the floor with a clatter, spilling its batteries. The room spun around me, and I caught myself on the counter top. After a few seconds I turned around to see her, eyes wild, tears streaked across her cheeks. She bore her teeth at me like an animal. I don’t think she expected to hit me that hard – it seemed like she backed off, surprised at her own strength. Her chest heaved from the sudden exertion. 

“Don’t you dare call them,” she growled. Her body was coiled as if ready to body check me again. “I could be so good for you, why can’t you see that? I love you with every ounce of my being. Why else would I spend so much fucking time getting to know you? You need to appreciate that!”

I reached into the drawer next to me and pulled out a knife, which made her take a step back, the manic look in her eye fading a touch.

“Last warning,” I said, keeping the point aimed at her chest. “I will kill you if you don’t leave me alone.”

“If you cut me into a thousand pieces each one would say ‘I love you!’” she said, putting her hands up, inching towards me. Suddenly she was too close for comfort.

I reacted – a clumsy lunge and slash born out of fear - she shrieked, her hands following the blade. The blade connected, slicing her palms deeply. She jerked back but just as quickly grabbed a dish from nearby and whipped it at me. The dish, slick with blood, slipped away from her fingers and fell harmlessly to the floor at my feet. I raised the knife again and took a hesitant step towards her.  Her eyes went wide and she began to back out of the kitchen, tucking her wounded hands under her armpits. Crimson ran down her sides and she disappeared from the room.

“How could you treat me this way? How could you do this to me?” her voice came from the living room, sounding increasingly distant. “Please let me in to your life…let me love you...”

I followed the spatters of blood out of the kitchen, the sound of of my heart hammering in my ears, drowning out much else.

When I looked around the corner the front door was open and she was gone, back out in to the rain. I ran over and slammed the door shut, turning the blood covered lock with a satisfying click. Quickly I went and checked every door, every window in my home and made sure they were locked. Every curtain was drawn, all the lights went out except for the kitchen and living room. After cleaning up my phone and making sure it still worked, I called the police. I only opened the door when I was sure it was them.

They took my statement and I showed them the knife, the blood, the broken plate and even handed over her cup for finger prints. No, they hadn’t heard of anything like this near campus before and no, they’d never heard of a girl named Emily and, finally, no, there was no vehicle broken down anywhere. The last part I figured as much. They pressed me on how I knew her and why I felt the need to use a knife on a woman. For a few moments I felt like they were going to put me in cuffs, but when the one officer put his notebook away and said they would be in contact I figured I was in the clear.

After they left, assuring me they’d let me know if they had any more questions or leads, I set about cleaning up the place, mopping the blood trail. My mind kept spinning, replaying a lot of grisly what-ifs in my head, and after a time I find myself collapsing onto the couch my mind and body too tired to continue. I stared at the wall and before long I fell into a fitful sleep, filled with dreams of manic eyes, blood slick floors, and sobbing voices.

----

I’d taken a week off from classes. I informed all of my professors, including the dean of every department, about what happened, risking a trip to campus to tell them. With my hood up and sunglasses on my face I kept an eye out for my stalker but not once did I see her dark hair in the crowds of students. I could only hope I scared her off permanently. I was grateful the faculty understood my situation was unusual and granted me extra time, as it was my last semester, to make up any work I may have missed.  My parents, well, I didn’t want to worry them. I lied and told them I’d had a party, something they forbade me from doing with the home, and while I faced consternation from them they could swallow the story that some frat boy got too rowdy and the police had to be called instead of the truth about my stalker. In retrospect, not my smartest move.

I became even more of a shut in during that time. I asked every food delivery place to leave the food on the porch. They could find their exact change and tip in an unmarked envelope in my mailbox. If I did go out and drive, which I may have done all of once the week I was hiding, it was late at night with a baseball bat next to me in the passenger seat. I’d taken to placing a chair against my bedroom door every night despite the front door being locked. Every odd bump, every scratch against the window, I imagined her there, looking back in at me, crazed eyes running with tears.

But with each day that passed, I gradually felt safer. No odd phone calls, no mysterious letters, or anything one might...expect with a stalker. I almost felt like I’d been a hero in a movie, fending off an attacker and living to tell the tale. All the same, I had the police on speed dial if I needed them. Sunday morning, however, I heard a knock at my door. I almost jumped through the ceiling, that’s how quiet my place had been. It was several minutes before I could gather myself to check for someone waiting outside. When I did, the porch was empty of people, my only company a warm breeze on what was otherwise a nice spring day. But after sweeping my eyes across the porch I spotted it. The small body of a kitten, its neck twisted in the opposite direction of its front. Its eyes bugged out of its head and its little tongue poked from its mouth as if it were still silently gasping for air. The fur around its neck was clumped and pressed into its skin, as if someone had been choking it before its neck was snapped. In spite of myself, I wept, having no doubt who left me such a grim present. My heart twisted in anger briefly before being overcome with horror. The message was clear. I wasn’t actually safe.

Carefully I retrieved the little body from my front porch with a pair of tongs from my kitchen, and I placed the kitten’s body into a ziploc bag. I had nothing else to bury it with. But then I realized why should I bury evidence? I called the police and after a brief wait they were again at my house. I showed them the kitten, telling them I had no pets but that someone had left this poor thing at my doorstep. They grimaced, seeing its rigid form in the bag. They did a brief once over of my home and property but they came back empty handed. Much like the other evidence, the police took the kitten too. They hadn’t had any luck with finger prints yet and DNA tests at the time took months to complete. Perhaps the kitten’s body would serve some purpose outside of being a grim reminder of my stalker, but I had my doubts.

I wished I could just hide until she left me alone. I called my parents, my words tumbling out of my mouth so quickly they told me several times to slow down.  I told them everything – starting with the fact that I had lied about the party.  I told them about Emily - her admission that she had been following me for a long time, her going crazy at my rejection, the “gift” she left me on the porch.  I heard them cry for me, begging me to leave right away and to forget about classes.  They would help me find another university and give the administration hell if they didn’t transfer all my credits somewhere else.  I could imagine them threatening a lawsuit.  I felt a knot of guilt in my stomach -  I told them I would try to handle everything. I decided, at that point and with my parents blessing, that I would take a sabbatical. First thing Monday morning I’d explain to my professors what happened to me this weekend. Hopefully they would understand.

***

The night of Sunday, hours before I was set to go back to class, I settled in to bed. With my chair propped against the door, I laid in bed, trying to read something light, a book about tabletop gaming, to hopefully give myself the illusion of normalcy. Still, images of the kitten and what the stalker had done to it swam over my mind’s eye. Its bug eyes and broken neck seemed to replace the words on the page before me. I wondered if Emily would do that to me if she could. Would she leave me, neck twisted in a horrible direction, in front of the police station like some kind of warning to any other man that might reject her? I shuddered uncontrollably and slipped beneath the covers, my head and hands peaking just out of the covers to read in the lamp light. Despite the fear, the mental exhaustion got the better of me and I fell asleep, the book tumbling to the floor.

It was at 3:30 AM, I know because I saw the clock, when I was jolted awake by the sound of breaking glass. I tried to ground myself by telling me I was dreaming and that this was the witching hour and who knows what tricks that was playing on my mind. It was only when I heard the crunching of booted feet on glass, the sound rang out clearly in the still night, that I knew I was actually in danger. I glanced around my room for something to defend myself with, but I was a college student. My room was threadbare. A bed, a desk, a lamp, the chair I was using as a door stop. I had some books, few of which were heavy enough to actually hurt anyone. The baseball bat! Well, I hadn’t taken that with me out of the car. I had been too afraid to leave my house and I thought, at worst, she wouldn’t dare break in. But my phone, maybe I could rush downstairs and call the police? That’s when I heard heavy footsteps on the stairs, each footfall sounding like a death knell. I scrambled to the far side of my bed in the corner of my room like a spider, pressing my back against the wall. I heard a single, dreadful knock at the door to my room.

“Ross…” I heard a voice rasp. It was her. She didn’t sound right. Something predatory, something possessive was in her tone.

I stayed silent, hoping she might turn around and leave. There was another knock, and another, and finally a solid kick against the door.

“Let me in, Ross. I just need to talk to you, explain to you my sides of things. I need to explain that I wasn’t trying to scare you or anything. I can be very sweet, very gentle. You know I can be. I’m not here to hurt you.”

Her voice was like ice on my spine. She continued for a few minutes, trying all manner of sweet words, gentle pleading, promises of kisses and eternal love. She said I would understand everything if I just let her in. I refused, I stayed silent. Her words grew more agitated and finally a kick landed against the door. And another. I saw the door shake in its frame, but in between the lock and the chair it wasn’t moving. I heard her pounding her fists against the door but it would not yield. She tried the door again, as if it somehow might be unlocked this time. There was a long pause.

“Fuck you!” she shouted. I heard her stomp back down the stairs, feet crunching on the broken glass again, likely back out the door.  At least I hoped it was back out the door. To maybe never bother me again.

This was my chance - I had to move now. I scrambled back across the bed, unlocking the door, nearly leaping down the stairs two steps at a time. The house was dark, as I’d left it. From the stairs I could see light come in from the front door and the multitude of pieces of broken window glass reflecting back at me across the living room floor, a hundred sharp stars waiting to cut up my bare feet. No sooner had I taken a few steps towards the kitchen than Emily’s form appeared in the doorway. I couldn’t see her face as it was drenched in shadow, but the nightgown around her body shimmered in the orange light. So too did the metal head of the sledgehammer she held in her hands.

I didn’t have time to call. I ran back up the stairs, pissing myself in the process. I didn’t care. I shut my bedroom door with a slam and put the chair against it. Then I dragged my desk across the room and placed it against the chair. I realized how stupid that seemed and I was about to put the desk against the door when I heard a heavy thud against its wood. And another. This was it. This was my end.

The head of the sledgehammer broke through the middle of the door, sending splinters of wood showering down. I heard Emily scream with rage as I screamed with terror. The wood crunched with every hit. Finally a single, glaring eye poked out at through the jagged hole in the door.

“It’s your fault I have to do this,” she breathed, her voice sounded ragged with exertion. “You could have just listened to me and let me talk.” She brought the hammer down again. More of my door, my last line of defense, disappeared into so many useless particles with a crunch. Crunch. Crunch.

I threw my lamp at her head, cable and it all. It sailed over her, smashing against the wall of the hallway behind her. My room was now dark except for the digital clock on my nightstand, gently highlighting the room in an eerie red. She stepped away, back behind the cover of the remaining door. I could hear her panting, the head of the sledgehammer thudding against the floor as she caught her breath. I took the moment to push my desk against the door, the chair still under the doorknob.

“I’ve got so many things planned for you, Ross.” she said and I heard her hand press against the door as if she could touch me,” you’re tiring me the fuck out first but it will be worth it. For both of us. You’ll understand what it’s like to be close with someone for once in your fucking life.”

“Leave me alone, please. Can’t you take a hint? I just threw a fucking lamp at your head.”

“The way I feel about you, about us, it isn’t normal. It’s special. It’s the kind of love people could write songs about, recite poetry about in coffee shops, make movies out of. You don’t deserve to live alone in this place, all cooped up. You need me in your life.” she said. And she started swinging again. Finally the hole was big enough. Gloved hands gripped the jagged hole in the door and she hiked herself up and over into the room, plopping down onto my desk. Her nightgown swam around her legs, the top of it clinging to her breasts, slick with sweat. A purse, no, a toolbag swung back and forth in front of her from her shoulder.

“Hello there,” she said. “This would have been much easier if you’d just opened the door like a gentleman.” She slid off the top of the desk, her boots hitting the floor with a thump. She reached over and switched the light on. I covered my eyes from the brightness, but the freak in front of me kept her gaze fixed on me like a fox in a hen house.

“Now, just hear me out,” she began. Half blind, I threw myself at her, my fists swinging, a terrified cry escaping my chest. She put the handle of the sledgehammer against the floor and side stepped me, my feet catching on the handle and sending me plunging into my desk next to her. My head hit a drawer with a thud, stars filled my vision. I could hear her growl behind me and she yanked my shirt so hard I fell backwards and sprawled out in front of her.

She brought the hammer down next to my head, the wood giving a sickening crunch next to my ear. 

“I’m really tired of your shit, Ross. So because you won’t listen, I’m going to teach you a lesson you won’t forget. Ever.”

I curled into a ball and started crying, hands placed uselessly over my head if she decided to swing again. I could only sputter protests. I heard her stepping around me, the bag falling with a metallic thud somewhere near me. She grabbed my hair and dragged me to the bed, scooping me up with surprising strength, and threw me bodily into the mattress. I laid there, sprawled out on my back, vulnerable to whatever she going to do to me.

She gestured with one hand at the bed while I cowered, my eyes filled with tears.

“Stay. If you move this will hurt a lot worse.”

She reached into her bag and pulled out a strange knife, its blade ending in a sharp, narrow tip that more resembled the tooth of some aquatic predator than something you’d use in a kitchen. My hands were hovering in front of my face now, palms outward, and with a swift movement she slashed the knife at me. The blade bit into my palms and blood quickly fell onto my lap. I yelped and pulled back, trying to seal the wounds with my shirt but she wagged her finger.

“How do you like that, you fucking prick? Not so good when you’re on the receiving end, huh?. That really hurt me when you did that. It hurt us. So I think it’s fair that you get to suffer the same pain.”

I put my hands together in a crimson plea.

“Emily, please stop. I’ll do anything you want. Just please don’t hurt me any more. You can’t do this to me. It’s wrong. Everything you’ve done here is wrong.”

“You know what’s wrong? Not accepting the gift I left on your porch.” she idly examined the knife, now red with my blood. “And you called the police again. Did you think I wouldn’t notice? Please. There isn’t a thing you did in the past week, including going out late at night to avoid me, that I didn’t see. You’re predictable, almost boring. I tried to give you a chance and to let me explain myself but clearly you’re just interested in hurting me more. So, now, I’m going to hurt you so bad you will never forget me. I’ll make sure that no matter where I end up I will always be a part of you.”

With that, she grabbed me and flipped me over, lifting the back of my shirt with one swift motion.

“Stop!” I cried. “Stop it! Don’t hurt me...please...”

“Too late,” she said, her voice dead pan.

And she placed the knife against my back and began slicing my sensitive flesh. I howled, gripping the sheets with my bloody hands. I tried to get up but she pressed a knee into my lower back while the blade worked upwards. Suddenly the bite of steel left my skin and she placed the knife against the nape of my neck.

“No, no, no you had your chance. I’ve made it so you can never forget my name. Now let me finish your little tattoo so...”

I pissed myself again, I was certain of that.

“...everyone will know you’re mine.”

And then she went back to work. I cried over and over into the mattress. Eventually I stopped feeling anything – my rage, my pain, my fear all faded into acceptance punctuated by the occasional sob. I began to feel like I was less in my body and more that her violation was happening to a body somewhere else, in some other world.

Suddenly the carving stopped. I heard her let out a contented sigh as she examined her work. I heard the blade clatter against the floor, no doubt sending splatters of blood everywhere. I didn’t dare curl up into a ball. I didn’t dare scream. I laid on my stomach, frozen in place. I felt her lay down next to me and lazily drape an arm across my back while my back stayed bloodied and exposed. The cool air brought little relief to the burning pain I felt. She rolled me over so I could face her.

After watching my face for a few seconds, she let out a groan of pleasure and pulled me close, hands sliding over my back, her hair pooling around her face while she looked at me.
“I really enjoyed that,” she whispered, her eyes looking at me half hooded. “I finally got some release for all that shit you put me through. Now that I’ve ruined you and made you mine, no one else can have you. You’re mine forever. Marked by me. Taken by me. That’s what true love really is. Belonging to someone in a way no one else ever will.”

I looked back at her blankly, my hands throbbing as they balled into fists.

“You know, most guys beg a lot more when I do that to them, but you, you hardly said a word once I started. It almost seemed like you liked it.” she scrunched her nose at me playfully and nuzzled my neck. “Unlike all the other assholes I’ve met I guess you can be taught to listen to me.”

I felt a single tear roll down my cheek, my impotent rage all but contained to a burning in my chest. She leaned in and licked it away from my face while her hands ran through my hair.

I reached up and ran the back of my hand along her cheek. She smiled and returned the gesture by pulling my hand up to her lips and placing a kiss against my bloodied palm. When she pulled away, her lips and teeth were stained red.

“Mmm you taste so good Ross.” she purred. “I could have this every day and never get bored.”

I snapped. My arms shot up I plunged my thumbs into her eyes. I pushed and pushed until I heard loud wet pops and felt viscera pouring down the back of my hands. The scream she made chilled me to the bone, but with my thumbs still in her eyes I threw her head to the side, determined once and for all to end this.

I scrambled off the bed, my whole body screaming with pain and grabbed the sledgehammer.

“Why would you do this?” she cried out, her empty eye sockets searching for me. Her hands searched the air for me, the pain making her movements slow. “Why would you when we were finally a couple? When we were finally united as one?”

I swung, and the head connected with her chest. I heard a sickening crunch as her ribs snapped and she immediately coughed up blood. She groaned and fell forward, arms folding inward like a praying mantis.

“No one deserves this,” I said, gasping, my own pain making it difficult to speak. “How many other men have you done this to?”

A crazed smile spread across her face, eyes unseeing but somehow looking at me. A torrent of blood left her mouth and she wiped the excess away with the back of her hands. She laid there, her death no doubt rapidly approaching. Her hands twitched, her fingers splayed out to show me five. Then retracted and splayed out again. Another five. Dear god. Fifteen.

I brought the sledgehammer down, crushing her head, and I fell to the floor. It was days before the police came to check on me and by that time her corpse was bloated from the humid spring air.",1,1763322224.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1oyv08i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oyv08i/business_as_usual_my_boss_asked_me_to_do/,Business as Usual / My boss asked me to do something insane and horrible.,"Every day I just want to call in sick, to tell my boss that i have some kind of stomach problem and I simply cannot work today. Its a thought I'd had every day before this happened and id always stuffed it down. I knew my parents wouldn't like me skipping work, they always tell me i need to be doing something if I'm not going to college yet.

I have to drive to work at four in the morning on unpaved, snowy roads, after scraping the snow off my shitty car which was not made for this weather. All i could think was how the hell did it start snowing all of a sudden? Just yesterday it was sunny, and dry, in a cold winterey sort of way. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.  But when my alarm rang, I was greeted with a serene coat of white covering the world outside. I looked out at the serene beauty of nature with nothing but  dread. My younger brother will almost certainly spend the whole day watching Minecraft videos on YouTube, since school will give him the day off due too the dangerous conditions. But unfortunately for me, my boss doesn’t care if I die.  
I drove through the freshly snow-covered roads out of the suburbs, past the small towns, into to the highway between two mountains, and arrived at the shitty little building in the woods where I worked. “Funkee Monkee Pizza.” I don’t know who the fuck was going to be getting pizza at this hour all the way out here, but this is my job.

Our job at Funkee Monkee Pizza is to make a pizza every hour. There always needed to be fresh pizza ready to be served to the few people who ever came to this fucking place out in the middle of nowhere. We don’t deliver so the pizza just rots in the display case until we are required to make a new one and throw the old one in the compost bin. The compost bin is unlovingly referred to as the “Bernard Bin” due to it having a photo of our boss, Bernard, with his wide smile, giving a “thumbs up” above a label reminding you to throw it out every two hours and that you would be severely punished if you ate any of it.

I walked past two of my co-workers, Tom and Elijah, and into the break room, praying to god Tom didn’t say anything when I walked past him. I had been up until midnight scrolling twitter, so I wasn’t exactly running on a lot of energy. We keep a coffee machine in the employee break room, but you have to sign a sheet saying you drank from it and it would be deducted from your paycheck, along with a mandatory fee for milk and sugar even if you didn’t take any. Every once in a while, I try to sneak a cup while nobody’s looking.

Tom, my co-worker strolled right into the room as I was sneakily sipping my morning brew. I nearly had a heart attack but tried my best to play it cool. He looked at me and then the sheet before whispering “Look, Cass, could you please just stop doing that?”

“Hey, look, sorry. I just forgot to sign okay, I was going to do it after I finished.” I blathered out.

“Please, you know its against the rules, and Bernard says that if we see anyone breaking these rules, we are required to report it, and that makes me complicit, ya know. I don’t want to report you, but I also really don’t like going behind Bernard’s back like this.”

Tom was a Scrawny guy, looks about 25. Tom’s the type of guy who always has a big fucking smile that can really piss you off if you’re in the wrong mood. He’s always bringing doughnuts so other people will like him, and since everyone else seems to like him, I can never bring myself to tell him to shut the fuck up. He’s also the only person here who seems to like Bernard. He tells me that Bernard is friend of his family, which is what got him the job here. Every time I hear him speak he goes on and on about how much he loves this shitty job, about how satisfying it is to make a pizza and “serve up smiles” or whatever. He’s the only person whose “customer service smile” seems remotely genuine. Or maybe he’s just really good at faking it. Overall there’s nothing wrong with him as a person I guess I just find him really annoying.

I got on the floor and saw Elijah setting up the pizza oven. He turned to me, looked me in the eye and looked back at the oven without saying a word. Elijah had been working there longer than anyone else there. His employee tag said he was 42, but his face had the stress lines you would expect of someone at least 55. His slightly greying beard was scruffy and his hair was in dreads. He had deep sunken eyes, that looked like he had the life sucked out of them over the years. He wasn’t usually very chatty, I cant remember the last time I heard him speak to anyone outside of work duties. It was kind of hard for me to have an opinion on him.

Bernard arrived about half an hour late, but he’s allowed to do that because he wasn’t going to fire himself for it. Bernard is a man with a constant corporate smile that never quite semes to reach his eyes.

Bernard strolled, or more accurately waddled, up to us. His slim fit blue shirt and skinny jeans emphasizing his obese figure. His tie was a bright purple with a paisley pattern. Every day he seemed to have a new brightly colored tie with some crazy pattern that always looked stupid on him. He had a small coffee mug with the same photo from the Bernard bin plastered onto it. He gave one of those to all of his employees every Christmas as if that made up for not paying them anything above minimum wage. “Hey there Funky Monkeys, crazy weather today am I right?”

He looked to Elijah, the only black man in the room, and joked “Elijah, my homie, you’re looking like a real funky monkey today.” I have no idea if that was an intentional racist remark or if he’s just that fucking stupid.

Tom smiled “heya Bernard, we were wondering where you were.”

“Well look,” He said casually. “I have a little bit of a special task for you today, I know this isn’t what you’re used to… I need you to hide a dead body for me.”

I thought it was another one of his weird, unfunny jokes. And that he would reveal he was actually planning another one of those “team building exercises” he makes us do after closing time without pay. Tom and Elijah seemed more confused than anything. But all doubt was done away with when Bernard dragged the body in through the front and dropped it on the floor.

It was the naked corpse of an Asian man, slightly obese, maybe early thirties. “He wasn’t wearing any clothes when I found him.” Bernard mentioned glibly. His whole naked body, with every wrinkle, every hair, freckle or glob of fat was laid bare for all of us to see. He probably wouldn’t have been happy about that fact but maybe I can take solace in the fact that he’s too dead to care. The strangest part about it was the face, it was twisted and contorted into a frozen scream. One that didn’t die when he did. The cold freezing the echoes of his last moments of maddening terror. That ruled out him dying of the cold. If he had died of frostbite, he probably wouldn’t have done so screaming.

Tom was shaking, he looked like he was on the verge of tears. Elijah was just standing completely still, mouth slightly open and with the widest eyes I’ve ever seen. I was pacing around the room with my head in my hands muttering “What the fuck” over and over again.

Tom was the first to speak up “you… want us to like, hide this?”

Before Bernard could say anything I budged in “Who is this? Why can’t you just report this?” I wanted to ask “Did you kill him?” but I doubted Bernard would answer that honestly.

“Are you kidding me? If it gets out that somebody died anywhere NEAR our establishment, what do you think what that could do to business? for sales, for customers, for the property value? I guarantee everyone in the Funkee Monkee family is gonna make a lot less tips. Look, for all I know, someone could come looking for this guy any minute, now all we got to do is move the body deep into the woods, somewhere where it won’t be associated with us. We have a few hours where the snowstorm will hide our footprints and eventually someone will find it, far away from anywhere where it could be associated with us. Now, if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill your duties here, I understand completely, but it will result in termination of employment.”

Elijah’s eyes somehow got even wider before he finally spoke up “Where do you want us to put it?” he asked with a deep exhaustion in his voice.

I turned to him angrily “I’m sorry are you just okay with this?”

He glared at me with his tired, sunken eyes “No, not really… might was well get it over with.”

Bernard, still cheery as ever was tapping away on his phone. I’ll send you a maker on google maps for where I think it would be best to dump it, it’s just out in the woods. Bit of a hike but I’m sure it’ll be fine.” He turned to Tom and put his hand on his shoulder. “You’ll do this for me right Tom? It’s a heavy body so I’ll need all three of you to carry it.” Tom started trying to stammer out a response before Bernard kept going. “Look Tom, you’ve been my best employee for a few years now, and right now I’m giving you an opportunity to go above and beyond. After all I’ve done for you, surely you owe me this one favor.”

“You… we.. we’re just going to move the body right? Like we aren’t going to hide it really? nobody’s getting hurt. The families and everyone will still get closure, right?”

“Right! yeah Tom, that’s the attitude I want to hear. I knew I could count on you. Good boy!”

I could not fucking believe what I was hearing. I watched as everyone turned to me, expectantly. “Fuck you! No! I don’t want any part in this I…..” Their stares were burning into me, killing the words in my throat. There was no way I was going through with this, but they all wanted me to. “Don’t let us down Cass. We all need this.” Bernard said through his disarming smile.

“Cass, lets just get this over with.” Elijah chimed.

Tom didn’t say anything but gave me puppy dog eyes.

“Shut the fuck up, this is fucking illegal and... I… I… I just can’t.”

Bernard’s smile disappeared for a split second, before he put it back on and stepped towards me with his hands held open to me. “Okay I’ll admit this might not be entirely legal but do you know what? We here at Funkee Monkee are a family, and as a family we need to watch out for each other, isn’t that right you two?” My two co workers nodded glumly. “Now, if you don’t want to do this for us, then we might have to find some other explanation for the body, perhaps we could even say that you suddenly snapped and killed him. you wouldn’t want that would you? His mouth was smiling like always. But his eyes, usually dull and empty, were filled with contempt. “Now, that would still be bad for our business, but it would be much worse for you. Given that, I think it would be better for both of us if you do this for us. I’ll stay here and make the pizzas, capiche?”

 

And so that’s how I ended up out in the woods, shivering in the snowstorm at 7 in the morning carrying a dead body in a bag by the legs. Trudging my feet through the snow with my only real light source being the flashlight on Elijah’s phone. My winter clothes weren’t the greatest, but I still couldn’t do anything about it.

Everyone had been completely silent for almost the entire trip. which wasn’t unusual for me or Elijah but, definitely for Tom. I could see him in front of me, Holding up the body by the stomach, barley managing with his skinny arms. “So…. how much further?” he finally peeped up. Elijah, who was in the front holding up the shoulders, grumbled “I don’t know, I can’t get a signal out here, but last I checked we were about a third the way there, give it an hour and forty minutes.”

Bernard had given us coordinates to a spot to dump the body. It was deep into the woods and off the track of any hiking trails. I had a look at the map of the area and noticed the nearest building was another pizza place about a kilometer away.

“I still can’t believe you guys agreed to this so easily.” I told them. Elijah just chuckled while Tom started sputtering. “Hey, you agreed to this as well.”

“Yeah well we could have told Bernard to just do it himself. but you guys left me alone”  
Elijah turned back to give me a dirty look. “I have a kid Cass. I can’t lose my job, I’m already making minimum wage. A week without a paycheck will kill us. I know you go home to your mommy and daddy who let you live with them cook all your meals but I’m a fucking adult who has to actually work for a living.”

I spent the next 45 seconds silently trying to figure out how to respond to that before Tom tried to change the subject. “So… who do you guys think the body is exactly? Where did he come from?”

“I think Bernard killed him.” I said. “I don’t know why, or whether he’s done this before, but he definitely murdered him.”  
Elijah laughed again. “Nah, guy like him, You think he’s some kinda serial killer? Really? He’s a shithead but I don’t think he has it in him. If he did kill this guy, he probably hit him with his car on the way here. And now he’s trying to cover it up.”

Tom seemed weirdly mad at that. “You guys Bernard is a really nice guy if you get to know him, I understand that he does some bad stuff some time, but running a business is hard and he’s doing this for the sake of our jobs and…“

“Tom. Shut the fuck up.” Elijah said, something I’d wanted to say ever since I started working here.

Tom decided to change the subject again. “Do we even know how this guy died? I couldn’t see anything obvious on the body.”

As they were bickering, I felt something I had never felt before, like several alarms in my brain, that I didn’t know were there, going off suddenly despite no stimulus. I got an implacable feeling of being watched. I can’t describe it as anything other than that. I could see that Tom and Elijah felt it tooyeah as both of them had stopped and Tom was looking around nervously. That was when I heard the footsteps, just barley audible, with the snow cushioning the steps. they were coming from right behind us. I had to force myself to turn around. It took every ounce of courage I could muster.

There was the face of a man inches away from mine, way closer than the footsteps made me think. I jumped back screaming like banshee. Tom and Elijah jolted at the sound, dropping the body bag before turning to look at the man. The flashlight on Elijah’s phone lit up his features in the pitch darkness. He was a tall Asian man, with a broad frame wrapped in a yellow winter coat. Like Bernard, He wore a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes. The man looked so familiar, familiar in ways I couldn’t place until… The realization felt like getting hit by a truck.

It was the corpse. It was the same fucking guy, he didn’t just look like he could be related.  He looked exactly like the corpse we had been carrying in a bag.

“Heya there.” He said “Its funny to see other people out here in this weather, huh?”

“Oh, uhh, yeah it is.” Elijah replied “What brings yyyyYYYYOOoouuuu……. Uh… out here?” I could hear in Elijah’s voice the exact moment when he noticed it too.

“Oh nothing haha, just enjoying the winter weather y’know. Hey, what’s in that bag you guys are carrying?”

 “Oh, just some supplies. For work.” Tom sounded completely calm and composed despite the situation.

Tom added “Yeah, yeah, our car broke down and y’know we have to carry all these supplies to work.”

I could feel my heart beating in my ears. Every cell in my body was telling me this guy was bad news, or maybe that was just the fear of getting caught. The more questions he asks the more he could tell to someone investigating the body once it gets found. but it was hard to focus on not getting caught when there was a much bigger issue at hand. I knew that whatever this was, I had to get rid of him.

“Well, we should probably get going, hope you have a nice day sir!” I said in my best customer service voice. Smiling through my teeth just like he was.

“Yes you’re right, I best be on my way, although I think I wouldn’t mind helping you guys carry that bag, it looks almost as heavy as me, haha.”

“Ohhhh… Nonono sir you don’t have to do that we wouldn’t want you to waste your hike through this lovely weather on us. we hope to see you again sometime.” Inside my head I was fucking begging him to just leave.

“oh sure, haha. Hey, where do you guys work by the by? I’d love to stop by there sometime.”

Tom answered before I could “Oh, just Funkee Monkee pizza. Look it up sometime. Bye!”

Idiot.

“Well, I’ll be seeing you around. Laters!”  He trudged off into the snow covered forest, footsteps much louder than they were when he was walking towards me. He turned back to look at us for a split second just as the darkness swallowed him up and he was gone. Him leaving felt like watching a storm pass. Elijah turned the light on his phone back towards the direction we were going. As im recounting this, I’m only now realizing he seemed completely unbothered by the light from Elijah’s phone shining right in his face.

 

We wandered deeper into the forest. the snow kept getting thicker, the sun was still absent. We still couldn’t find a spot where we could get a signal. Nobody seemed to want to discuss what the fuck just happened or who that was. If we had lost our way and were going in the wrong direction we would have no way of knowing. Tom said something about how a couple of trees looked familiar, but neither of us knew what to do about that. At that point I wasn’t sure how we would even know we were at the dumping spot when we got there. We saw a broken down abandoned cabin.

After who knows how long I felt Tom tap me on the shoulder before whispering.

“He’s following us.”

I began frantically scanning the dark forest, seeing absolutely nothing but snow covered trees. I whispered the message to Elijah. This seemed to agitate Tom, who I guess was hoping we wouldn’t speak aloud.

Elijah didn’t even bother whispering. “Who? The guy from earlier?”

“Yeah,” said Tom, “the guy from earlier, he’s trailing behind.”

Elijah scanned the trees behind us with his flashlight as I had, also finding nothing.

“What do we do?” I asked

Tom thought about it for a second. “I think we should have someone confront him while the others take the body away. Keep him distracted.”

The idea of being alone with that guy sent a chill down my spine. I couldn’t describe why or how. He was already creeping me out when we outnumbered him. “Bad idea. Bad fucking idea.”

Elijah nodded. “Yeah I don’t know about that, he gives me a bad vibe.”

Tom seemed absolutely taken aback. “What why? just cause he kind of looks like the guy who died?”

There was more to it than that, but I felt like I just couldn’t vocalize it in a way that made sense so I kept my mouth shut.

“Look, most likely, he’s related to the guy.” Tom whispered.  “He might be looking for him which could be a problem. If we distract him long enough to drop off the body, we can report it, giving him closure and hiding suspicion.”

“Do you think he suspects something about us?” Elijah asked. “Why else would he be following us?”

“Well, all the more reason to get him off of our trail. So keep your eyes out for him.”

Me and Tom both took out our phones for the flashlights. I hoped that deep seated instinct from before would start telling where he is, that primal feeling of being watched keeping me safe, but I felt absolutely nothing. Does that mean he isn’t here and I’m safe? I had no way of being sure. that was honestly more frightening than if I felt his presence.  Trudging through the snow now felt like we were prey being hunted by a predator. One that we don’t even know the nature of. We don’t even know where we were going. Just hoping we had been heading in the right direction. I did not like the idea of finding out we were going the wrong way and having to turn back, only to find him trailing behind us. Being the one in the back meant if he snuck up on us, I would be the first person he got to.

As we hiked I began to feel a little at ease, which might have been wishful thinking. I wanted to believe that he had left us alone and we could dump the body in peace. It was still so dark despite how long we had been out there.  After a while I heard Elijah stop and mutter. “Holy shit holy shit holy shit.” he was looking at something in front of us.

Tom started panicking, looking ahead. He and Bernard were blocking my view so I couldn’t see what it was.

I had to ask “is it him?”

“No,” Tom replied. “We got to tell Bernard about this when we get back, this is really bad.”

“What are you talking about? Who are you talking about?”

Tom and Elijah looked back at me before shifting to the side to give me a better view. There was another body lying in the snow. Up against a tree. It was covered in snow, but it looked naked, with a face frozen in a deep scream. Tom got out from under the belly of the body bag, leaving me and Elijah to have to support the weight. He ran up to the body. Examining it. “I think it’s uh… a woman, looks maybe….. 65? I don’t see any cuts or anything.” He began looking around with his phone scanning the snow until he saw it. A lump in the snow. I set down the bodybag by the legs before apolizing to Elijah. I inched towards the bump slowly, I got a feeling I recognized its shape. but I desperately hoped I was mistaken. I began to cautiously dig through the snow on top of the bump,  trying to scrape it with my gloved hands., as if the snow was trying to fight back against me. I was met with a dead blue screaming face, lit up by my phone. I turned to Elijah and Tom who were staring at me with dread.

“How many more? Do you think?” I asked.

Elijah sighed “Who knows. There could have been dozens that we just didn’t see.”

Tom was hyperventilating at this point “Oh God, Ohhhh god the the hell. W-what happened here how did they die? What is this?”

“I don’t know what you’re asking us for.” Elijah replied.

I asked “Do you think we could just leave the body here? There’s no way we are too close to the restaurant. It would be fine. We could send in an anonymous tip and they would find this body among the others.” Elijah suggested.

“I’ll ask him.” Tom said. I noticed his phone was dialing. I wanted to tell him no but he was already going.  “I got a small signal, I’m telling Bernard about all of this.”

“What the fuck is Bernard going to do? Come up with another insane, poorly thought out plan and then force us to stick to it, I don’t want to hear whatever he- “

Bernard’s blaring voice on the phone interrupted me.

“Hellooo, Funky Monkey Pizza, this is Bernard Milgram speaking. Just to clarify, we do not deliver, what can I do for you?”

“Heeeyy… It’s Tom, we found more bodies in the woods.”

“Shit, are they close to the restaurant?”

“yeah, like halfway away from the restaurant and the drop off point.”

“Well move them too.”

Tom was stunned. Elijah just groaned and rolled his eyes.

I sputtered out “What all of them?”

“Yes all of them. We can’t let a single body be found near our establishment!”  

I looked around the place. We had no clue how many bodies there even were. For all we know, there could have been hundreds of bodies buried in the snow that we didn’t see. and any body we missed that gets found would be blamed on us. Plus that guy was in the area, possibly watching us. I could already see Tom unzipping the body bag, dragging the body of the old woman into it.

“There’s a guy who might be stalking us.” Elijah mentioned. “We don’t know where he is but we saw him following us.”

Bernard paused for a second “Hmmm… yeah that does seem like quite the pickle, if anyone sees you doing anything with a body you would have to kill them haha.”

A silence hit everyone in the group like a truck. We were too stunned to say anything. the shock of what he had said left all of us shooting glances at each other hoping they would be the one to break the silence until Tom cracked.  “Uhh… Bernard are you, like, telling us to kill somebody. I- I don’t want to kill anyone, I think that’s a really bad idea.”

“WOAH! hold your horses there kiddo I’m not telling anybody to do anything. I’m just stating the obvious fact that if somebody saw you doing something illegal like this, your only real option would be to kill them y’know? After all, that’s the only way to stop all of us from going to jail since corpses don’t talk. Is it wrong to state facts?”

I could not believe what I was hearing. there is no way he thought any of us would buy that. Then again its not like I could think of a better solution if someone sees us. “Yeaahh… we um, know how being dead works.” Although given what I had seen today I might not be sure about that.

“Good” Bernard said “So we’re on the same page then.”

“uh… Are we??”

Elijah chimed in “I think we are.” Me and Tom looked at each other, hoping the other knew what to make of that.

“Alright, you two keep your eyes peeled for anyone who might be watching us alright.” Elijah was speaking to me and Tom like we were his personal soldiers.

Tom hung up and looked at Elijah, “We aren’t killing anyone alright. we can find another way to deal with it.”

“When did I say I we were going to kill anyone?” Elijah asked. there was an apprehension in his voice.

We still had to do our jobs though. I thought about running away right then and there, but I was already doing something illegal with three witnesses. If I leave, then Tom would be alone with Elijah, but if me and Tom outnumber him, maybe we could stop anything to drastic from going down.

And then we could spend half of our lives in jail. I didn’t know what the penalty for this is exactly, but I knew it wasn’t good. I don’t know how we were going to convince anyone who sees us not to talk but I knew we had to try. It’s better than the alternative. If there was ever a point where I had a choice here, I missed it.

Tom tried stufffing the old woman’s body into the bag with the other one, but decided it would be too heavy. We decided it would be better to take the bodies one at a time. we had no clue how long that would take but we hoped there wouldn’t be any more bodies.

Suddenly Elijah shouted. “Over there!”

I couldn’t see anything, but was looking off into the trees at something I couldn’t see. I thought it was another body at first but that hope was quickly put to rest.

“It’s someone watching us. Not the guy from earlier, it was a woman. She was behind that tree.” Elijah began to sprint towards where he thought he saw our stalker. me and Tom exchanged knowing glances.

“Hey Elijah, what are you going to do to her?” Tom pleaded.

“I just want to talk with her.” by the sound of his voice I don’t think he did. He began pacing around a tree. “Where the hell are you?” Definitely not. His attention jolted towards another tree that I wasn’t looking at. “What the hell?” He ran towards a different tree. “She was just behind this tree didn’t you see it?” I looked around trying to see who he was talking about, until I saw an old woman peeking out from behind a tree next to the one Elijah was looking around. She was smiling. Her features looked subtly familiar until I realized who it was, I turned back to look at the screaming body of the old woman. It was the same woman. Just like the Asian man we met before, the corpse that was lying there screaming looked just like her. I froze in terror before looking back to the old woman who was now looking at me. She was wearing a yellow winter coat and had her mouth contorted into a smile showing all her crooked teeth her eyes were wide open and yet it was like I couldn’t see anything beneath them. I looked to Tom, he saw her too. Eliah turned around and noticed her and jumped in shock, falling back and dropping his phone. She ducked her head behind the tree, hiding herself completely from us.  “Do something you dumb shits, get her, she’s running away. I couldn’t see her running behind the tree but I took his word for it. Tom ran up to Elijah and grabbed him by the arm.

Tom pleaded with him “Stop! Stop It, What are you doing. We aren’t killing any-” Elijah punched him square in the face, knocking him on his ass in the snow. Elijah didn’t say a word before running off into the darkness, the light from his phone bobbing up and down as he ran through the pitch black darkness.

I checked on Tom who was groaning. There was blood from his nose leaking onto the snow he looked up at me and yelled “Stop him, please!”

I ran off towards where I thought Elijah had gone, until I saw his flashlight scanning the trees. desperately around him. I picked up a large tree branch and held it like a club.

“What the fuck do you think your doing?” I screamed at him.

Elijah turned his head towards me, shining his phone directly in my eyes like a flashbang. “That woman’s old, she’s lived a full life. My Daughter hasn’t.” I didn’t even know if that old woman was alive, or human. “I don’t know how the hell she’s so fast though. HELP ME LOOK FOR HER.”

“Th-that woman.” I replied “She looked exactly like the corpse of the old woman we found screaming

Elijahs eyes widened. “oh shit, just like the…” I could see gears turning behind his eyes, each rotation causing his eyes to grow wider and wider, his lips starting to quiver.

We were cut off abruptly by an ear-piercing scream. It echoed through the forest like the call of an animal but it was distinctly a human scream. It was Tom. Elijah and I sprinted back to where we had left tom. We were running like a deer that had been seen by a wolf. when we got to where we remember leaving Tom, he wasn’t there. The other bodies weren’t there either. We were frantically scanning our flashlights around, trying to find where tom left them, but we saw absolutely nothing except the empty body bag.

“Tom!” I screamed out. “Tom what happened?” I couldn’t see any footprints around. despite the snow, there would still be some footprints visible to us if Tom had wandered off. there was nothing indicating the three bodies were dragged away

“I don’t think Tom’s here Cass,” Elijah responded “I think whatever that thing is, it took away all the “dead bodies while we were distracted.”

“You think it took all three bodies on its own just like that?” I snapped

“I think it took all four bodies just like that yes.” Elijah looked at the ground solemnly.

Elijah looked at the blood in the snow from where he had punched him. “Maybe she got him because we left him weak and vulnerable. I knocked him on his ass and you left him alone.”

I began to shake uncontrollably, crying. “TOM PLEASE CAN YOU HEAR US?” I was met with no sound but the constant droning blizzard and wind that I had been listening to all morning. I don’t know what I was crying about, I didn’t even like Tom all that much. “WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU MAN?”  I looked to Elijah with tears in my eyes. “This is all your fucking fault you know that.”

Elijah shrugged. He was looking down at the ground he was hiding his eyes from me “Can’t do much about it now.” There was a crack in his voice. He looked at the body bag for a second. “I say we just take this back and say we dumped all the bodies at the sight. We don’t know what else we can do.

I was keeping my distance from him, tree branch in hand

He checked his phone before walking off in whatever direction it told him the restaurant was. He looked back at me and said “I don’t feel like staying in this forest any longer.”

For the rest of the walk back we didn’t say a word to each other. I kept looking around for signs of someone watching us but there was nothing. It was about 11AM so we could finally see without flashlights. Around every tree, rock and bush I expected to see someone watching us, to see the Asian man, the old woman, or even Tom smiling at us. But somehow we were left alone the entire time. Maybe whatever it was had it’s fill. Or maybe it was trying much harder at hiding itself. So all I had to keep me company was the silent Elijah trailing behind me and my own thoughts. My mom had taken me hiking in some woods near here when I was a kid. so these woods had always felt so safe and comforting up until now. When I finally saw the warm glow of FUNKEE MONKEE’s PIZZA just as it felt like my legs were going to give out from all the walking it was like seeing a lighthouse. I had never before been happy to see this place.

I there were no cars outside except the employee owned ones. I ambled into the empty pizzeria, I slumped down on the nearest chair to the entrance, throwing off my winter coat and taking time to catch a breath. Elijah came in after me and did the same. My legs felt almost numb, at this point. after all that had happened my body yearned for the opportunity to just sit down and not do anything. The pizza ovens warmed up the place quite nicely.  I wanted this brief reprive to last forever. I saw the no smoking sign taunting me from the wall. I looked to the pizza stands, with their shitty, greasy pizza shimmering from the lights. I collapsed down on a three seated round table next to the front door. Elijah came in after me and sat across from me, leaving the third seat empty.

“you’re not out of the woods just yet!” Bernards voice called.

“what?”

He stuck his head out from inside the kitchen. He was eating one of the doughnuts Tom brought “gotta get to work, remember? You are still on the clock.” He pointed to a clock on the wall with a sticky note on it that read **You** in big bold letters. Bernard was smiling from ear to ear at his hilarious joke.

I sat in silence for a few seconds, not wanting to move before I mumbled. “Tom is dead.”

“What?”

“Tom is dead. he died out there.”

“Oh…” Bernard said it with the same tone as if I told him there was a dead skunk in the parking lot. “well shit.”

 

The story Bernard came up with for Tom’s disappearance was he turned off the security cameras (right around the time Bernard came in with the body, which is why there’s no footage after that point) and started trying to steal all the money from the cash register, only to get caught by his employees and run off into the woods, never to be seen again. The police bought it as far as I can tell.

It's been a week since then. Elijah brought his daughter in on his day off. She’s 7 years old, cute kid. She seemed so happy to be here, even though the pizza crust felt like cardboard and the cheese tasted like plastic, and it was covering the sourest marinara you’ve ever tasted, she gobbled it up like it was fine dining. Elijah was unusually chatty that day, and at one point, while he was talking with one of my other co workers, he looked directly at me with his tired eyes mid conversation and said, “yeah you know, I work hard to feed her, it would be a shame if anything were to threaten my employment.” His eyes were practically burning into my flesh there before he just looked back at my co-worker, continuing his conversation as usual. That was the last time I heard him speak to me about anything other than work duties.

The hardest part of all of this is probably the fact that even after all of this, I still have to go to work tomorrow. I still have to drive into those woods every day, and walk along the floor where a dead body was dumped, and see Tom’s employee of the month portrait on the wall, and sometimes even see Elijah working the shift with me. And every day, Bernard is there, to give me his big empty corporate smile. I’ve considered telling the authorities what happened that day, but even if they would believe me, I would be implicating myself as well, and its my word against Bernard and Elijah's. I guess I'm only telling this to you guys now because i want the truth to be somewhere.

After looking into it, I found a ton of missing persons in that area. I found the old woman, who went missing three days prior. and the Asian man was reported missing a few days after Bernard found him. Still it’s impossible to tell if every missing person in this town was because of whatever I met in those woods but there are a lot of them that all seem to begin with someone going hiking there alone. Needless to say I don’t plan on going back in the woods anytime soon.

The hardest part of all of this is probably the fact that even after all of this, I still have to go to work tomorrow. I still have to drive into those woods every day, and walk along the floor where a dead body was dumped, and see Tom’s employee of the month portrait on the wall, and sometimes even see Elijah working the shift with me.

We had been chatting every day for the past two weeks, flirting with each other. Overtime we brought over our conversation to snapchat. It felt genuine, like she actually had interest in me, which is pretty rare in my case because 1. I’m an introvert (not by choice) and 2. I’ve had more than enough dates flake out and leave me waiting for them.

We were supposed to meet the weekend before, but A got a cold, so we postponed for next week. We arranged to meet at a coffee place, since it’s best to meet a date at a public place so they know they’re genuine + eye witnesses seeing the two meet up incase something happens. I wait for her for an hour and she never shows up. I ask her where she is and I don’t get a response. On the drive back home, I receive the message “Hey I’m so sorry”. No context, nothing else after that. Literally the last message she sent me. I wasn’t sure if she was playing games with me or something was going on. I asked her if she was okay, but she never read my message. 

I checked her snap score later to see if it was going up and it was. I wasn’t sure if I was being set up, but a part of me still hoped that she liked me. I wait until the next morning. A had posted a selfie on her story, but hasn’t even bothered to read the message i sent her. I feel let down, like the past was repeating itself. At this point i felt like a clown just by having her snap, so i unfriended her (blocked later). But now i’m just unsure about what to think; did something happen that i don’t know or am i just being lead on for her amusement? I already have low expectations of people in general because of the crap they pull off, so it’s easy for me to believe that someone would do this without a shred of guilt holding them down.

This had me curious as I was recently on a Smuckers earnings call and the question was asked, paraphrasing, ""If the tariff rate on coffee is only 5-10%, and manufacturing has not gotten meaningfully more expensive, why is Folger's brand coffee seeing a 25% margin growth"" and the answer was basically ""the consumers support the price growth"" which means ""screw you, you'll pay me anyways"" 

I get 2lbs of fresh roasted coffee delivered to my door for $27/month.  Light to medium roast, and I did the ""roaster's choice"" selection so I just kinda get whatever, but I've never been unhappy with anything I've gotten.

I’ve lived in Miami, Florida my entire life but have never had the means to live a “Miami life.” No income to be a socialite at nice brunch spots and boutique gyms during the day, and I’ve never been a nightlife club scene guy. Went through a brief phase in 2019 when I moved into my first high rise apartment with a roommate in downtown, but COVID put a stop to that.

Always been introverted and preferred solitude, but always understood the importance of being socially calibrated and not a lone wolf. I enjoy public speaking and at work I get along with everyone and am generally my most EXTROVERTED. I’m also very regimented and live/die my calendars/reminders/lists. No social circle outside of work friends you grab drinks with on lunch break sometimes

During the 2019 party era I definitely was part of a solid social circle of friends, but again, this was mostly due to us all being aligned on wanting to party and enjoy the city. Once COVID lockdown happened and venues closed, several moved away or just naturally fell by the wayside.

My best friend of 21 years is married with three kids. We text daily and meetup at least once a month or once every two months. We call these “fusions” due to our childhood love of Dragon Ball Z. We make the most of these fusions and they always recharge my social battery. I love that dude.

My work week fulfills me because I feel like I’m actually doing something valuable, there’s structure to my day, my time is spoken for, and there’s always something next on the agenda. I’m also on this “get promoted” tip and luckily for me there is an actual tangible path to getting where I want career-wise. I can taste how close I am, so work is enjoyable for me currently.

My M-F regimen is typically wake up, get ready, eat, commute, work, commute back home, change into gym clothes, exercise, dinner, shower, 1-2 hours leisure time in my PJs, knock out. I’m a huge WWE fan so I look forward to Monday’s because it’s the start of my 5 days of feeling like I matter and then I have RAW at 8pm to look forward too. Friday evenings after the work wee is over I get treated to Smackdown at 8pm. I’m a simple man.

But it does get repetitive and lonely. So Saturday mornings I’ll still wake up early like my M-F, and sure, I’ve got a list of things I want to do like go grab brunch, bike ride, book store, etc., but if I’m being honest I find myself out in public doing these things not even for the purpose of doing the thing but to just get out of the house. And that’s great that I’m doing that: getting dressed up, spending time outdoors walking around, getting sunlight, making eye contact, interacting with staff at cafes and bakeries.

But this STILL feels isolating. I have open body language, make eye contact, smile, but it’s like I’m invisible and no one notices me. Everyone’s already in groups so I meet no new people. Then go home dejected and just default to video games for the rest of the day.

Sunday morning rolls along and I’ll do the “go out, grab brunch/coffee thing again, but now slightly less enthusiastic about it then the day before. Rinse and repeat going out, feeling that dejected invisible feeling again, then back home to video games until the evening when I prep my Monday morning work outfit, shave, and wind down for the work week.

My work week gives me a sense of purpose and then my weekends make me question why I even exist. Anyone else relate?",7,1763321762.0,CasualConversation,3,0.89,False

I've lived in this apartment for a few years and have slowly been trying to make it feel less bad.  Yesterday, the walls were repainted to a much brighter cream and I have a La-Z-Boy Noah sofa/ottoman in moss coming in.

Here's what I'm already planning on changing:

1. Rust-colored accent pillows on the sofa
2. New coffee table that isn't comically tiny
3. The poster on the left is just a big poster of spacecraft to fill blank space.  My grandma had a newspaper from the moon landing that I'm getting framed for that wall.  I like my little space-themed area
4. I also hate the lamp on the right and am open to suggestions



There are a few places where I'm unsure:

My ceilings are 9' 4"" tall.  What do I do with all that space?  I was thinking of maybe hanging curtains around the window but that still leaves a lot of vertical space everywhere else.  I've also considered putting floating shelves in the right corner but don't love that with the printer there (there's basically no other room where the printer can go).

I know plants will make the room feel better.  I love my little plant friend and the big skeleton that tends to it.  I'm just afraid to add any more in here because there's lots of stuff that doesn't mix well with water.

Is there a better layout I could have?  I don't like the window behind the TV.  That window faces west which means you can't use the TV in the evening.  But the fireplace and slider blinds mean that side of the room doesn't have space for the TV.  The other side has a sliding barn door  so it's awkward as well.

  
The among us sign has to be in the room somewhere.  It's voice-activated and part of a years-long joke with my friends.",2,1763321527.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False
1oyuqma,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oyuqma/which_smart_plugs_for_energyefficient_homes/,Which smart plugs for energy-efficient homes?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been on this energy-saving kick lately, and one of the best things I've done for my home is adding smart plugs. I know it sounds like just another tech gadget, but hear me out – these little devices actually make a real difference in cutting down electricity bills.

**Why Smart Plugs Work for Energy Efficiency**

The thing about most electronics is they keep using power even when you're not using them. Your coffee maker, TV, phone chargers – they're all vampires sucking energy 24/7. Smart plugs let you completely cut power to these devices without unplugging everything manually.

I started using them about six months ago, and my electric bill dropped noticeably. Not like hundreds of dollars, but enough that I noticed and felt good about it.

**What Makes a Good Smart Plug**

After trying different models, here's what actually matters:

- **Scheduling features** – Set your devices to turn off automatically when you don't need them
- **Energy monitoring** – Some plugs show you exactly how much power each device uses
- **Remote control** – Turn stuff off from your phone, even when you're not home
- **Voice control compatibility** – Works with Alexa or Google Home if you're into that

The scheduling thing is huge. I have my wifi router on a schedule to turn off at night since nobody's using internet while we sleep anyway. Same with my gaming console setup.

**My Recommendation**

Look, I'm not going to pretend I tested every single smart plug out there. But if you want to check out some solid options that actually work for energy savings, I'd recommend [browsing through these smart plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs). They've got different models depending on what you need and your budget.

**Where to Actually Use Them**

Don't just throw smart plugs everywhere. Focus on:

- Entertainment centers (TV, game consoles, sound systems)
- Kitchen appliances you don't use constantly
- Desk setups with computers and monitors
- Lamps and decorative lighting
- Phone charging stations

Basically anything that doesn't need constant power.

**The Real Impact**

I'm not gonna lie and say smart plugs will cut your energy bill in half. But using 5-6 of them strategically around my house has made a noticeable difference. Plus there's something satisfying about knowing you're not wasting electricity while you sleep or when you're at work.

The payback period is pretty quick too. Most decent smart plugs cost between $10-25, and if they save you even $5-10 monthly, they pay for themselves fast.

**Final Thoughts**

If you're serious about making your home more energy efficient without doing a major renovation or buying all new appliances, smart plugs are an easy first step. They're cheap, simple to set up, and actually work.

You can [check out various options here](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and find what fits your needs. Even starting with just 2-3 plugs on your biggest energy wasters makes a difference.

I just need some advice on what to do. 

Honestly I don’t even know where to start, he is 42 years old, over the years I’d say about the past 10 years he has gradually resorted to the whiskey. He now drinks a bottle of crown in the span of a day or 2. That alone makes him mean. My mom is starting to get depressed because he treats her like she’s worth nothing if she doesn’t “give it up”. Yes he’s very old school and thinks a woman’s purpose is to cook and clean and you know, bedroom. The way he treats my mom is so disturbing. She cooks, cleans, does his laundry, picks up after him, (he doesn’t even pick up his own trash). He talks to her like he hates her unless something good happens to him specifically. If he’s in a bad mood or had a bad day he comes home and takes it out on everyone. It’s so bad that even if we were to ask him a simple question he gives us this stare? Like a really fucked up look of “I really don’t give af about what you’re about to say”. 

Now with us, his kids, my youngest sister works with my mom, and they also share a lot of personality traits. She’s not afraid to tell him when he’s wrong and he refuses to ever admit he’s wrong. That dynamic is horrible as you could only imagine. He has gotten abusive a couple times with just her and my mom. Not with me or my oldest sister. Mainly because we just nod and agree. My older sister is so unproblematic she would just leave to avoid dealing with it. Me, it almost feels like I’m the therapist of the house and I only step in if I have to. I’ve had to get him off of my mom only once but I had to get this man in a headlock and pretty much use all my body weight to pull him off my mom. He throws things when he’s pissed off like pans, trash cans, literally anything around him.

Some things he does- if my mom makes for example tacos for dinner and he already had that in the past couple days, he won’t eat it and will make it a big problem. He chooses what we eat 80% of the time. If the coffee isn’t prepared for him to brew in the morning, it’s a bad day automatically. If nobody makes his plate for him for dinner, he won’t eat. He’ll take shots and catch the biggest attitude until he decides to just go to his room and go to sleep. I seriously don’t understand his logic ever and it pisses me off so bad. I feel so bad for my mom because she is such a sweetheart. She’s a beautiful woman and a kind hearted soul. My dad wasn’t always like this either so.. any advice is appreciated and any questions feel free to ask. Thank you in advance

If you’re wondering why my mom doesn’t just leave, I don’t know, they’ve been together for 25 years now, and just recently bought their first house together. I think they rely on each other money wise and that’s also why all 3 of us (daughters) still live with them.

Like many of you who have worked in coffee, my very first barista job was using Mazzer grinders. I’ve always known about the brand and known the grinders are tanks, but never really knew anything about the company. 

This summer I had an opportunity to film a short brand video, and besides being proud of the final result I also think the company itself is awesome.

A few fun facts:

* Everything that’s possible to make in their Venice workshop they do… they even make the screws they use in their grinders (this blew my mind). Cool to me in a world where a lot of these legacy companies are starting to build in China and elsewhere.
* The company is family-owned. To me this is notable because so many of these equipment companies are now owned by massive corporations.
* The best part for me: the people who run the company (the Mazzer family) are genuine, funny, warm people.

In this chart, I took the moon to be performing multiple functions: it’s a co-significator of the question, it gives some context on our current relationship to each other, and it is a co-significator for him as well since it’s in the 7th. The Moon in Aquarius, to me, shows we don’t know each other/there isn’t familiarity/and someone has a neutral or detached sense of the other person or what’s coming together. The Moon applying to trine Venus in Libra in the 3rd suggests that what is coming is a fun, light, intellectual, or casual interaction, perhaps with some flirting. The Moon is in Venus’ bound, which gives it some reception where it would otherwise be peregrine. To me this says that there is a level of attraction that is helping someone overcome the otherwise pretty neutral feeling that comes with interacting with someone you don’t know super well. This application also brings in matters of the 3rd and 10th.

Venus squaring Jupiter in the 12th is what’s confusing me. I think the Moon carrying the light from the Sun (me) to Venus (the basis of what is coming up) is activating that square, which would also bring in topics of the 5th, 8th, and 12th.

Some interesting things: the coffee conversation reflected this chart. There was a good amount of flirting, but also mixed signals. He’d situate himself close to me and then pull away and I did the same. With Venus at the IC, we talked about growing up in the same religion/faith tradition, and with Venus ruling the 3rd and 10th, we talked about me having recorded a podcast before I met him and about career. I also word vomited about a dream I had about a celebrity (I know) and definitely thought he thinks I’m insane and never wants to see me again. That’s Mercury in its fall opposite Uranus, and ruled by a 12th house exalted Jupiter. With Saturn in the 8th as his ruler, he talked about almost being free from student loans.

With no other charts being available yet (a chart I casted after the coffee basically said wait to ask again until after Mercury rx is over), I’m using this one and wonder if it just describes the coffee or our longer term deal. The luminaries are angular and fixed, and the benefic of sect is super dignified and angular. Taking it all together, I’m assuming it means that at a minimum, we’ll stay connected even if we don’t continue getting to know each other. Even though Venus is what we’re moving toward, I’m not sure it’s romance so much as affinity/a basic “like”. Would love other interps!!!!",1,1763320622.0,horary,1,1.0,False

Why can't I take all the coffee grounds I collected and put them back in one bag?

We already do this with liquids all the time (refilling bottles with water, gasoline, etc.). Why not have a similar system for solid items like powders, grains and other items? It would be great for organizing inventory and reducing the amount of waste we generate.

I know there must be some technical limitation behind this, but it's one of those things that seems a bit counterintuitive in the game. Does anyone else feel this way?",2,1763320601.0,cataclysmbn,3,1.0,False

My top 3 are - BDC, versace pour homme, dior sauvage 

Bdc is just perfect it gets the job done you can’t go wrong with this one. This isn’t a loud “hey look at me” fragrance It’s more like a clean, grown-up, confident scent. though kinda overpriced 

Versace pour homme edt - I think is kinda slept on and is very good summer blue fragrance it lacks in longevity but i think overall its very good

Dior sauvage- I don’t think there is a better fragrance made for day to day different situation i mean you can wear it in offices, date night just casual coffee run or parties 

The ones i don’t like - 

viktor& rolf dark leather accidentally bought by my sister for me i told her to buy viktor & rolf the night edp but she bought this instead 😭😭

The wanted edp- liked it initially but it kinda started getting me nauseous all of a sudden so i stopped using this one

Red polo edt- nothing wrong with this one it’s just that it was my first designer fragrance and i emptied that bottle though after some years i decided to buy this again but its not like how i remembered it maybe my taste was different back then or maybe they changed the formula idk 

Looking to buy a new fragrance for winter day to day would appreciate suggestions 🙏🏼

1oyuaa3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TakinchancesXII/comments/1oyuaa3/chapter_9_the_glass_veil/,Chapter 9 – The Glass Veil,"Minerva didn’t wait for another night. The lead was too fresh to let sit — and too close to ignore.

By midmorning, she was no longer The Nyx, but Minerva Filleas, the poised daughter of one of Obsidian Falls’ most influential families. Her name opened doors faster than any lockpick, and today, she intended to use it.

Elizabeth drove, as usual, every turn smooth and calculated. “You realize,” she said, glancing at Minerva through the rearview mirror, “that there are simpler ways to gather information than walking directly into a potential front operation?”

Minerva’s gaze stayed fixed on the passing buildings. “Simpler doesn’t always mean smarter. If they’re hiding something, they’ll hide it better at night. I want to see how they act when they think no one’s watching.”

Elizabeth sighed. “Remind me to increase your life insurance policy.”

The car pulled to a stop in front of Orren Logistics, the same office building from the surveillance feed — modern glass facade, modest signage, and a blandly corporate look that screamed forgettable. The kind of place that could ship anything, anywhere, without ever standing out.

Minerva stepped out, her movements elegant, controlled. A tailored charcoal suit replaced her usual armor, her hair tied back neatly. Everything about her looked polished — except her eyes, which missed nothing.

Inside, the lobby smelled faintly of coffee and disinfectant. A receptionist looked up as she approached, the polite smile of someone trained to measure people in half a second.

“Good morning, Miss—”

“Filleas,” Minerva said smoothly, offering a calm smile. “Minerva Filleas. I’m here to discuss a potential investment opportunity with your operations director.”

The receptionist’s posture straightened immediately. “Of course, Miss Filleas. Do you have an appointment?”

“No,” Minerva replied lightly, setting her bag on the counter, “but I imagine the Filleas name still carries enough weight to make one.”

The receptionist hesitated, eyes flicking toward her screen. “I… can check with upper management. May I ask what this is regarding?”

Minerva leaned in just enough to project authority without threat. “Let’s call it corporate curiosity.”

She smiled again — the kind that disarmed even the cautious.

The receptionist disappeared down the hallway, heels clicking against tile.
Minerva waited, outwardly composed, inwardly coiled. Her gaze swept the lobby — security cameras in the corners, a pair of guards stationed by the elevators, polished surfaces that reflected more than they revealed.

Elizabeth sat a few seats away, legs crossed, a fashion magazine open but clearly unread. Every few seconds, she flicked her eyes toward the desk, then toward Minerva. From this distance, the faintest shake of her head meant no trouble yet.

The elevator chimed.

Three figures stepped out.

At first, Minerva’s focus went to the woman leading them — sharp suit, practiced smile, the type who lived and breathed boardrooms. Operations director, she guessed. But then her gaze shifted.

Her breath caught.

Behind the woman walked Tovan Veyre — composed, unreadable, the faint trace of amusement tugging at the corner of his mouth.
And beside him… her father.

The world seemed to tilt for half a heartbeat.

“Miss Filleas,” the director greeted brightly. “I’m surprised — and honored — to have you here in person. I wasn’t aware your family had taken an interest in Orren Logistics.”

Minerva managed a measured smile, every instinct screaming behind it. “It’s a recent development,” she said smoothly. “My father likes to keep an eye on promising ventures.”

Her father’s expression was warm, familiar — proud, even — but his eyes flicked briefly to Tovan before returning to her. “Indeed,” he said. “When Tovan mentioned he was consulting here, I thought it was time you two finally saw how the other half of business operates.”

Tovan’s tone was mild, polite, but laced with something deeper. “Always a pleasure, Miss Filleas. Though I must admit, this is an unexpected setting for our reunion.”

Minerva’s heart steadied, her mask settling into place. “Life is full of surprises, Mr. Veyre.”

Elizabeth, from her seat across the lobby, quietly closed her magazine. Her eyes met Minerva’s for a split second — an unspoken question: What now?

Minerva’s reply came with a single subtle nod.
Play along.

The conversation lingered in the air just long enough to feel awkward before Minerva’s father glanced at his watch.

“Well,” he said easily, “I should be getting back to the board meeting. Tovan, you’ll join me?”

Tovan inclined his head. “Of course.”

He turned to Minerva with that same calm composure — the faintest suggestion of something unreadable in his eyes. “I trust the good director will take excellent care of you, Miss Filleas.”

“I’m sure she will,” Minerva replied evenly.

Her father smiled, placing a brief hand on her shoulder. “Don’t keep her too long, dear. We’ll talk tonight.”

With that, the two men departed through the main doors, their voices fading into the echo of polished marble and revolving glass. The second they were gone, Minerva’s posture shifted — subtly, but enough for Elizabeth to notice.

The operations director gestured toward the elevators. “Right this way, Miss Filleas. I’ll take you up to the twelfth floor. We can discuss your potential investment in more privacy.”

“Perfect,” Minerva said, matching the woman’s polite tone as they stepped inside the lift.

The doors slid shut with a soft chime. As the elevator began to rise, Minerva’s hand brushed her jacket sleeve — a tiny flick of her wrist releasing a micro-drone no larger than a coin. It slipped through the narrow seam at the top of the panel and vanished into the vents above.

“So,” Minerva began smoothly, “how long has Orren Logistics been in partnership with my father’s holdings?”

The director smiled, clearly pleased to talk business. “Almost six months. Your father has been instrumental in streamlining our shipping infrastructure. We handle most of the high-value cargo transfers through our port terminals now.”

“Interesting,” Minerva murmured. Her fingers slid casually along the elevator’s control panel, planting a thin adhesive strip no bigger than her fingernail — a listening node disguised as a smudge of dust.

The elevator dinged. Twelfth floor.

They stepped into a long hallway lined with glass offices and muted lighting. The director led the way, heels tapping a steady rhythm across the marble floor.

“We’ve been expanding operations across the Eastern corridor,” she continued. “Security has become… more complicated.”

“I can imagine,” Minerva said lightly, scanning the hall. As the woman spoke, Minerva trailed one hand along a decorative metal trim — a subtle brush that dropped another bug beneath the edge.

They passed an open storage alcove; Minerva slowed just enough to release a second drone from her cuff. It glided silently along the ceiling, vanishing into the shadows as they reached the conference room.

The director gestured for her to enter. “Here we are.”

Minerva smiled faintly, stepping inside. “Thank you. I always appreciate transparency.”

“Of course,” the woman said, returning the smile, unaware of how literal the statement had become.

The afternoon sun bled gold across the mirrored glass of the Orren Logistics building as Minerva stepped outside, every movement calm and composed. The meeting had ended without incident — polite smiles, rehearsed pitches, and a stack of glossy reports she had no intention of reading.

Elizabeth was already waiting by the curb, the black sedan gleaming like a shadow amid the city bustle. She moved with effortless grace, opening the rear door as Minerva approached.

“Miss Filleas,” she said smoothly, her tone as professional as ever, “your carriage awaits.”

Minerva allowed herself the faintest smile as she slid into the back seat. “Always the dramatist.”

Elizabeth shut the door, circled around, and climbed into the driver’s seat. The hum of the engine filled the silence as traffic merged around them. For a moment, the only sound was the quiet murmur of the city outside — then Elizabeth finally spoke.

“So,” she said, adjusting her mirror, “how did it go?”

Minerva leaned back, loosening her collar slightly. “Efficient. I was able to bug everywhere I wanted to — elevators, halls, the conference room, even the executive network hub.”

Elizabeth sighed, a sound halfway between exasperation and amusement. “No, darling, I meant the meeting.”

Minerva turned her head just enough to catch Elizabeth’s reflection in the glass. “Oh. That.” She paused, then shrugged lightly. “Boring. Corporate pleasantries, quarterly projections, and enough jargon to make me miss field briefings.”

Elizabeth smirked faintly. “So in other words — hell.”

“Exactly.”

They drove in silence for a while, the tension of the day slipping away inch by inch. Outside, the skyline of Obsidian Falls gleamed under the setting sun — a maze of ambition and secrets.

Minerva’s gaze drifted toward the window, her reflection ghosting over the city lights. “Still,” she murmured, almost to herself, “it wasn’t a waste. They’re hiding something… and now I’ll hear every whisper of it.”

Elizabeth glanced over, one eyebrow lifting. “I suppose that means another long night ahead?”

Minerva’s lips curved into a tired smirk. “Would it really be us if it weren’t?”

Elizabeth exhaled softly, merging into traffic. “You do have a point.”",1,1763320358.0,u_TakinchancesXII,0,1.0,False

Overcomplicating things with BS like memetics or praying for your random meme to go viral is just a bit hopeless

Instead maximise your chances by choosing projects who will get there through sheer will and who are actively making waves in the space.

This is why I hold **Kendu**

**Distribution**

Kendu's HHI score is 25.67, this is absolutely unheard of and is actually pretty insane levels of distribution. Diamond handers dominate the majority of the supply and they ain't selling until the tens of billions.

**Community Work Ethic**

* Over 20 IRL initiatives like energy drinks, coffee, merch, murals, beer and more
* 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes for the free audit, only other coin was Pepe
* Strongest community on Reddit and Stocktwits and very strong on X
* Consistently wins social media competitions for art, an example by CMC's BOOST ME COMPETITION
* Telegram activity higher than SPX, Giga and Mog over weekly periods

**Kendu** is an absolute unicorn and will change this space forever just watch, I have never seen anything remotely similar and you never will ever again!

This is your chance to get on the ground floor of a life changing project, yes it sounds far fetched but when you see the work, you see the goal...

Me diagnose issues with carb and /or other issues with my truck. How to do that?


I have slowly been getting my ‘86 Chevy c20 field find into a rig that I won’t be afraid to jump in and take to town or coffee and cars events. Or even take to work to keep some miles off the new stuff. 

I have had many small victories throughout the process and have taught myself (with the help of youtube, forums, and this sub) many things I always thought were beyond me. 

I’m to a point where I’m getting frustrated. I’ll do my next project on the list and it’ll be great, and then something else will put me back where I am worse off than I was. 

Currently, I’m getting a wonderful start up and idle, but when I start to give some gas it shutters and misses and once I let off the gas it sputters out and then won’t start.   

I don’t know what I’m dealing with. 

In the past, I would call my dad and we’d diagnose and get the problem fixed. However, my dad passed away about 3 years ago. (Before I started this project) 

My dad was a car nut and could fix anything from large home projects to most toys when I was a kid. Without him I’ve had to rely on the YouTube’s and such more. But it’s cool when o figure something out, I know he’d be proud and was probably with me through the project. 

Here’s the main question:  how would I find somebody like that near me?  Like not a mechanic that’s going to charge and such, but a guy that can help me diagnose and teach me some stuff along the way. 

I need a friend that knows more than me. But as you may know, new friends aren’t a high priority when you get older. And it’s awkward and I got enough going on. lol. 

I’m not on Facebook or any of the other socials to see what groups are near me, but I’m not opposed to a Facebook account with purely marketplace and squarebody/hot rod stuff. 

Idk. I’m asking how would you go about finding a guy to come spend some time under your hood?  That sounds weird….

1oyu330,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1oyu330/1230_you_only_meant_well/,[1230] You Only Meant Well,"I think there’s a moment to capture.

The last few days I’ve been feeling viscerally aware of how good I have it. To be sure, I practice active appreciation for my circumstances, but I think a lightly drunk conversation with my dad, when I haven’t drank that much recently, helped nail the point in deeper. We talk a lot of politics. I often return to the idea that no matter how crazy things have gotten in the budding-fascism landscape, we’re more Huxley than Orwell in why we might be slow to react or as forcefully as required. Do I really want to die for anything on any given day? Not as much as I want to be entertained, eat, or hang out.  
  
I feel like the story for a long portion of my life is one that was tempted to complain. I could have a lot of amazing things happening to me, and I would default to what I could criticize, fear, or be angry at. I think this was an extension of how helpless I felt, in spite of any, and often, demonstrated capacity. It’s still there, both an incredible capacity to complain and do great things. The difference in my old-enough adult mind between how they operated in the past to now is how I feel about them. The feeling informs, it doesn’t steer.  
  
I’m what I consider to be an _extremely_ judgemental person. Exercising judgment is a different game than weaponizing it. When you’re not in control, it’s a defensive weapon by default. You’re trying to distance yourself from all of the things to be fearful and angry about. When you are in control, you can say something like, “I find this scary, but” or “I’m filled with rage, yet.” Sentences structured like that are often red flags for diminished accountability. “I love you, but” “I know I said that, except.” When you’re stuck in your feelings, you can’t hear the contradiction. You don’t understand the disconnect between your words and actions.  
  
I’ve gone well over the cliff of trapping myself in an environment that tries to pair my words and actions. As a result, there are literally hundreds of things I’ve written about that I’ve claimed to want, fix, or work on that are a living record/dare to test me about what I “seem” like or “what I mean.” As often as I can squeeze, it’s precisely what I _do_. This is also a prerequisite for getting credit for what you don’t do. How else could you determine laziness and neglect from a real choice? How big is your basket of evidence that you mean what you say? What confidence can you have in yourself that something is reasonable or “realistic?”  
  
My extreme judgment is always going to target myself first. It’s why patience and grace are also practices. I, mostly, know about me in any given moment. Can I dig up every hidden thought and instinct? I certainly try, but no. Do I know an exacting percentage of diseased or complicated cells itching to kill me? Of course not, but I don’t feel sick. We’re invited, in what feels I suspect to most people like an endless nag, to be constantly observing ourselves. Could you ask for a better environment for creating anxiety and depression if you didn’t grasp the nature of your control? Your feelings defensively picking you apart indefinitely?  
  
I find myself returning to the idea of “I can’t.” It’s just this persistent echo. It’s a response to the idea of complaining about “my life.” I have it so fucking good. Poor, I’m good. just-enough money, I’m good. Practicing or building something everyday or sitting around watching TV, I’m good. I’ve never been genuinely hungry a day in my life. I’ve survived every brush with death so far. I have so much stuff, and stuff that reflects my values and privilege. I don’t feel arbitrary and predatory impulses that weaponize my judgment or intelligence. I know that I want my castle built on the same foundation from which I built my shed.  
  
Do you feel it? Do you feel like you’re in a place of perpetual potential, or surrender? Are you waiting until you hit 40, or 50, for the license? How much more do you need? Who’s going to be your sugar daddy or are you already hysterical by what has been granted from &nbsp;your Orange Alpha? So much of what I choose to spend my time on has been a direct repudiation of what I’m told I should feel or do, starting as reactionary spite, and then molded into deliberate practice. I had to learn what I actually preferred. I had to clock my actual energy and enthusiasm for what types of engagement and towards what things. A perspective wasn’t bestowed upon me, it had to be excavated and shaped.  
  
And it’s ongoing work. I’m sensing an analogy when it comes to working with A.I. I’m building me-centric software to manipulate and organize media files numbering in the hundreds of thousands. I have to think methodically, notice when it’s drifting, and learn things about how I can accidentally break or undo what was working. It’s taken me 20 hours on a piece of vibes-coding software to get, maybe 20% of where I’d like to be in quickening what I’ve previously been doing manually for hours/days. It’s personally gratifying/exciting to see what I can create. When I describe my media habits to most people, you can tell I sound “weird” or “crazy” or “just why?”  
  
I’m not otherwise distracted, so I get to drift and linger in spaces that aren’t about merely surviving into the next miserable day. I get to gamble in ways that aren’t frivolous. I get to form opinions of things I’m not immediately inclined to give a shit about. And I get to do that quasi-indefinitely, even in the midst of when practical things come calling. The way to tear my appreciation for all of that down is to think about what I don’t have, or designate an “ideal” that feels, currently, unreachable.

A couple days ago I thought about writing a “here’s everything that’s awesome about me” piece. As I thought about the awesome thing, I immediately wanted to counter it with all of the negative examples or incidents from my life. That I can or want to do either, but most importantly _both at once_&nbsp;I think is one of the most important things to protect about myself. I’m prepared to give credit where it’s due. I’m not dispositionally avoidant of what else a story or framing could mean. I’m not letting how I feel about any version of my life be the dominating factor in how I consider myself or what I choose to do next. I’m everything good, and everything bad, about me. I’m every word I’ve typed, and everything I’ve yet to access, or never will.  
  
All things being true, at once, I chose these words. I’m choosing my coffee. I’m choosing to return to my A.I. software project soon, then it will probably be food and to play my media. I’m healthy. I’m close to the right temperature. I’m surrounded by what I’ve actualized and what remains as my potential. I’m actively contemplating and discussing other goals and collaborative projects. I’m in the recent memory wake of attending the movie theater yesterday, as well as a comedy show, and 14 concerts/performances across 3 cities over the last 3 weeks. I went to my favorite bars with my favorite people. I ate and drank heartily. I made $1,300 selling _some_&nbsp;of my Pokemon cards. I’ve cuddled with 5 cats.

I think it’s okay to want things and “more.” I don’t think you actually want those things or something more if you can’t feel as deeply the wild and improbable nature of what you’re already within. If you can’t access the creative/destructive power of literally any given moment, it’s unclear to me you can qualify as “conscious” or approach some idealized version of “human.” If that sounds judgmental, consider it’s not actually saying anything about you.",0,1763319886.0,self,0,0.5,False

With this said,  a bit of background on me.  I love geeking out over coffee.  My daily driver is a Technivorm Moccamaster.  I've had it for over 5 years, and I take impeccable care of it.  I buy whole beans from Costco because honestly, between my wife and I, we drink a lot of coffee, and we'd spend a fortune in 1lb bags of fresh roasted beans - although I do understand these are without a doubt superior.  I'm a frequent lurker on James Hoffmann's channel and love his videos.  My favorite espresso drink so far is a flat white.  My wife's favorite would either be a flat white or latte.

I've read great reviews on this sub of the Bambino espresso machine.  I'm looking at the regular that sells for about 299 USD.

The only upgrade I would make right off the bat is to buy a bottomless 54mm portafilter and 18g basket.

I really can't afford to get this plus a descent grinder.  I have a brand new Baratza Encore that my wife bought me earlier this year because my old Encore that I bought off Craig's list had bit the dust.  I stupidly did not opt for the ESP that could do descent espresso.

What would you do in my situation?  I'd be open to an inexpensive but good hand grinder - I'm not against hand grinding as I would most likely not be making more than a couple of espressos each day.

Safe to say it’s been… an experience. Every profile feels like déjà vu, the same clichés on repeat.

**Here are the greatest hits:**

1. A story about almost getting arrested abroad (Barcelona, Ibiza, Prague - bonus points if it involves “skinny dipping” or “stealing a street sign”).
2. Generic hobbies: “traveling, food, long walks, wine” - wow, you and literally every human being alive.
3. Scheduling a date that feels like booking a meeting with your manager. *“How does 3 weeks from Thursday look for a quick 30-minute coffee slot?”*
4. A proud declaration that you’re a “plant mom,” immediately followed by “lol I kill every plant I touch.” (Congrats, you’ve mastered the art of buying ferns just to commit slow botanical murder.)
5. Something about being “fluent in sarcasm” like it’s a rare skill.
6. A claim that you’re “so bad at texting” even though your screen time is 9 hours a day.

So let’s skip all that.

About me: I’m in London, I work in finance, and yes, I travel (though I’ve never been “detained in Spain,” so maybe I’m missing out). I’m more into finding the best dim sum spot in Chinatown, a strong negroni, or a last minute trip abroad.

What I’m looking for: something light, casual, fun. Not a serious relationship right now. Just meeting people who don’t treat dating like an admin task, enjoying a laugh, and seeing where it goes without the pressure.

**Things I appreciate:**

* A conversation that lasts more than 4 texts.
* Someone who can enjoy both a ballet at the Royal Opera House and a late-night kebab on the way home.
* A partner who doesn’t think “traveling” is a personality, but still has a valid passport.
* A sense of humour about how ridiculous dating apps have become.
* Binge watching reality tv and gossiping about the drama.
* Meeting IRL - London based only.

I came across a post on Fbook about ""pay what you can"" markets in Belgium. While I do know about some initiatives that are rather similar (food availability for low income people such as for example recently expired food getting sent to food banks), I can't say I've ever seen anything like this. Especially not on Sundays.

Do you know if this is true? I googled a bit and found zero info apart from a few copy-pasted Fbook posts, most of them with lousy AI photos (or ""photos"").

For context, this is the copy-pasted text:

>""In Belgium, community markets are redefining access to fresh food by holding “pay what you can” events every Sunday. Unsold produce from nearby farms, grocers, and bakeries is gathered at pop-up stalls in parks or town squares. Instead of fixed prices, a small sign simply invites people to contribute whatever they’re able — or take what they need without shame.

>The initiative, run by local volunteers and food cooperatives, aims to reduce waste while restoring dignity. Families facing hardship can choose vegetables, bread, and dairy without needing to explain themselves. Elderly residents often donate a little extra, quietly balancing the system. What’s left at the end of the day is composted or redistributed to shelters, closing the loop without landfills.

>Markets are designed to feel lively and ordinary, not like a food bank. There’s music, coffee, and recipe sharing — a market experience that welcomes everyone, regardless of wallet size. The system works on trust and abundance: when food is rescued from waste, there’s enough to go around.

>This Belgian model turns surplus into solidarity, food into freedom. It’s not charity, but a reset in how we think about access — where feeding each other becomes a shared Sunday ritual, not a service.""",0,1763319614.0,belgium,7,0.33,False

Update 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/uMVTyBbusT

Wow. I can’t believe this happened over five years ago now. In some ways, it feels like it happened to me in a different life. I still get messages asking about this and figured I could add some insight into how life can look a few years down the line after everything gets completely and utterly wrecked. Good news—If you put in the work, it looks pretty fucking great.

First of all—where is my ex husband now? I haven’t had contact with him since September of 2020 and largely don’t keep track of things but I can see that this man still follows me on Instagram and watches all of my stories. I considered blocking him, but just let it be. I think it’s the petty part of me who’s living a full life that’s fine with rubbing it in a bit.

He and the affair partner did get married after a whoopsie kid and I’m pretty sure they had another. But they also both lost their jobs as teachers (he got her a job at his school, so she was working with an entire staff that knew they had an affair) and had to move to the middle of nowhere. Last I heard of them, the affair partner had been texting his former best friend unhinged rants about not including them in get togethers or allowing my ex-husband to be a groomsman in his wedding.

But enough about them, because they already took up way too many pages in my story.  When we last left off, I think I had just moved to a new city (shoutout to Richmond, VA!) and was largely just finding myself again. I think the change of scenery was the best thing that I did for myself. I was never meant to live in the suburbs and moving to a beautiful little city where I can walk to coffee shops, bakeries and bookstores honestly helped my mental health as much as the therapy. I bought a house here a couple years ago and have really settled in.

Then I got my puppy, a corgi named Bilbo Baggins who really is the true love of my life. He is the greasiest thing to happen to me and is just such a fantastic chonky guy. We go to a local dog park with a bar all the time and he even has his own lil’ dog social group. Kids aren’t something I plan on, so he is basically my son.

It hasn’t all been perfect. My dad died, my best friend moved across the country, and I largely haven’t really been dating much the past couple of years.  Dating hasn’t been a huge priority for me and my friends say that I’m probably too picky. I say that I know what it’s like to be in a marriage with someone who might love you but doesn’t like you and it’s worth not settling.

But while I may be single, I am fulfilled and busy. My birthday is Saturday and I’ll be spending it in Paris at a Lady Gaga concert. I saw Sabrina Carpenter in Amsterdam, Taylor Swift in Lyon, Springsteen in Edinburgh, Noah Kahan at Fenway Park. Earlier this year I was able to visit Katmai National Park and see the brown bears in the falls. I have a DnD group and a really amazing village of people I love.

I would not be in this headspace if I didn’t go to therapy and work out the why of me settling for this man in the first place. True story: When planning our honeymoon in New Zealand, I, of course, had to plan the entire thing despite him picking the location. He refused to do any driving, so we had to do a guided tour that left on specific dates. He pretended to not be able to get a day off of work when we needed to leave until I started crying and begging him to just ask his boss for it because literally no other flights worked. That’s when he said he actually always had the day off but wanted to make sure I was actually working hard enough to choose good flights.

Anyway, I chose to marry… that and it was a lot to unpack in therapy.  But I’m glad I did because without it I don’t think I’d have built this life for myself. At the end of the day, what happened set me up to live a happier life than what I was living so in some ways, I’m thankful for the experience, shitty as it was.

If you’re in the middle of something terrible, unfair, and world-shattering to you, just know that it’s not forever. While this experience has made me a bit of a believer in karma, I also know that there was a lot of work to get myself out of that big black mental hole. Sometimes it seemed that I would slide back in it but by looking forward and figuring myself out, I eventually clawed my way out. I think you can too—and that you’re worth fighting for.

TLDR: Got therapy, life is good, ex-husband stalks me on Instagram, and maybe we should all get dogs for our mental health. ",233,1763319499.0,relationships,27,0.98,False

1oytu85,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oytu85,An 11 month update/before and after!,"Hello everyone! I'm back! 

There have been some more recent updates that we've done to the kitchen.

https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1hm684z/thank_you_for_the_suggestions_a_month_later/

(Hopefully that link to the older post works out).

Just a recap of my last post:
- a new sink (installation of sink/granite cutting and new sink/faucet was $1,050)
- painted cabinets $100
- Amazon under cabinet lights $50
- new ceiling light $50

What other updates have happened since?
- removal of outlets (why was there an outlet directly above the sink? I'll never know but it was dangerous for me to keep leaving the toaster wire in the sink after I was done using it). Installation of new outlets and PROFESSIONAL under cabinet lighting $1,900. This also included updates to the breaker box and an inspection.
- Laminate ""wood"" floors!!! We installed this through the house (except for the bedrooms/bathrooms) so this was $3,000 by itself.

So now we are at a kitchen refresh grand total of : $3,180 (If we want to include the floors? Splitting hairs and including the floors by square footage would probably be a grand total of around $4,000 - I've never claimed to be great at math).

Not to mention some very grownup purchases of the Moccamaster coffee pot (it was completely necessary - I don't want to mention to state and condition of our old coffee machine) and a Staub French oven.

I’ve always felt that a ***breakfast*** or coffee meeting is one of the most underrated ways to truly connect with someone in this city. There’s an intimacy to the morning - before the day’s chaos takes over - that you just can’t replicate on a loud evening adventure. It’s a low-key, genuine way to get to know someone better.

For the past few months, I’ve been on a mission to find places that get this right. I’ve been rating spots on a “Juicymeter” **based on their potential for connection:** **Joy, Uniqueness, Intimacy, and Community.**

Here are **my top 5 breakfast spots** that are perfect for a cozy, meaningful conversation. I’d love to know what you think and what hidden gems I’m missing.

**JuicyMeter:** 3.02 🍊

But it’s like I have a force field around myself saying “keep out”, too guarded, too resistant to the possibility of being perceived by small minded individuals in sinister ways.  I did make a male friend though.  That felt safe.  He sang a great rendition of the temptations “ain’t too proud to beg”

It’s good though too.  It helps me stay focused on my mission.  Getting the future balanced for future \*\*\*.  I’m gonna have all the things I’ve wished for, I can feel it, it’s just gonna take time, and patience.  I think I’ll honestly have things greater than I can currently imagine.  This year is a turning point, I’ve made sure of it.  I blocked \*\*\*\*\* on here, because I like keeping everything logged on here but I don’t want to be viewed upon by the outside world, this is my public sanctum that is somehow completely private.  My inner world is safe here from the perception of those who have place me into a box of definitions and expectations.  The perception I have of myself has no limit, but the way I’m perceived by others is limited to their experience with me and the words and actions of others.  Because they cannot see a future plotted out with my spirit, but I see that future for myself and I’d rather explore it without judgement or outside influence.  Nothing personal \*\*\*\*\*, but people’s words get inside you sometimes, they create doubt and confusion.  

Some of my ideas are so fragile that if exposed to the scrutiny of outside critique they would burst before they have the chance to manifest.  So at least in these early stages, I keep this private and to the eyes of those I know don’t carry the whip of harsh words.  I’m relaxing today then I’m back for three.  I picked up thankfully, I’m addicted to work, it’s the only place I feel satisfied these days, and I don’t believe that’s a bad thing.",1,1763318733.0,u_aleedelleedelleedeli,0,1.0,False
1oytkxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/PMDD/comments/1oytkxs/seeking_advice_for_managing_cyclic_mastalgia_with/,Seeking advice for managing cyclic mastalgia with chasteberry + my PMDD/Endo journey so far,"I have PMDD + Endo, and have spent the last \~fifteen years trying to understand and manage my symptoms. I currently have my endo symptoms managed after having a lap for endo removal + Mirena IUD placement. I currently have most of my emotional + insomnia PMDD symptoms managed after I changed jobs to a less stressful one with a flexible schedule, and have had years of therapy including CBT for insomnia. However I'm still having really bad breast pain for \~10 days per 24 day cycle. What I mean by this is that I wear sports bras 24/7 for compression, it is painful to towel off after a shower, I have to hold my boobs anytime I walk down stairs, anytime I accidentally brush fabric against a bare nipple I am in absolute agony. It does not affect my work, but it does greatly affect my quality of life during my personal time.

I am interested in using chasteberry (vitex), but I'm seeing conflicting information from peer-reviewed studies versus how people actually use it. Specifically:

\- studies seem to use 20-40 mg every day, while supplements are sold with capsule dosages almost exclusively in the 300-1000 mg range. ,

\- studies use a daily dose, while people actually using chasteberry either 1) take it daily, 2) take it only when symptoms arise, or 3) take it daily except for a 5 day break to avoid building up a tolerance.

I asked my gyn about using chasteberry, and her response was that she does not comment on supplements but she did link to the NIH page about chasteberry and reiterated there is some evidence available but no high quality randomized controlled trials.

**Why is there such a difference in the dosing and timing between users and studies? Is one a better starting point than the other?**

I am inclined to start with the lowest dosage available at my local CVS (300 mg) during symptoms only and then ramping it up later on, but I also don't want to waste a bunch of time experimenting on myself if that is too low or too infrequent of a dosage.

\------

**Things I've tried so far**

**Combined Hormonal Contraceptives** (Cryselle, Blissovi), taken continuously for 10 years and 1 year respectively

\- Pros: stopped ovulation which eliminated endo and pmdd symptoms

\- Cons: migraines, sensitivity to sunlight, low libido, inability to orgasm, breasts hurt a little bit all the time, decreased enjoyment of life. Had to stop because of migraines with visual aura.

**Progesterone-only pill** (Slynd) taken continuously for 9 months

\- No changes. Slynd did not stop ovulation for me. My period blood was more clumpy but cycle timing and PMDD and Endo symptoms were otherwise unchanged.

**SSRIs** (Zoloft) taken with 3 month on-ramp, 6 month plateau @ 50 mg, 3 month taper

\- Pros: decreased amount of uncontrollable crying during luteal. Made my lows a bit less low.

\- No changes to insomnia, breast pain, or period pain

\- Cons: SO MANY SIDE EFFECTS. Muscle tremors, light headedness during exercise, brain zaps when tapering on/off, apathy towards life, hypersensitivity to caffeine and alcohol, weight gain (20lbs in first 9 months which plateaued as soon as I started tapering and reversed (lost \~8lbs) once I was off it without any intentional changes to diet/exercise).

**Lap + Mirena IUD** (diagnostic + endo removal)

\- Pros: decreased pain associated with endo, lightened periods significantly. Very emotionally validating to have endo formally diagnosed after 15 years of suspecting it.

\- No changes: still having cyclic PMDD symptoms including insomnia, breast pain, bloating. I pass a decidual cast once per cycle but otherwise only have light spotting.

\- Cons: two months of healing from lap. Adjustment period to IUD included a lot of cramping for first 3 cycles before chilling out. Passing a decidual cast every month is pretty gross. Lots of laundry from surprise spotting.

**""Healthy"" lifestyle** (healthy diet, exercise, no alcohol)

\- No changes. This wasn't too different from previous lifestyle though.

**Quit caffeine** for 2 years

\- No changes. I previously had 1 coffee/day so it makes sense that there wasn't a big change.

**CBT for Insomnia** via sleep clinic for 8 months

\- Pros: it changed the way I feel about my insomnia so that I am less stressed about how it impacts my life

\- Cons: it did not stop me from having insomnia

**Melatonin**

\- Sometimes this helps me get to sleep, but also sometimes it doesn't. It has been really helpful for jet lag when traveling though.

**Trazodone**

\- This knocks me out and leaves me groggy in the morning. I try not to take this unless I really need sleep and it's been several days of really bad insomnia.

**Quitting stressful job**

\- Pros: decreased many of emotional PMDD symptoms and allowed me to find a job that was more accommodating for insomnia and painful periods. No cons. This was one of the best choices of my life.

Do I need a Dentist, a Periodontist, or a Doctor of Dental Surgery?","I was recently diagnosed with periodontal disease. According to the dentist, my deepest pocket was ""8"" (I assume mm?), I have stage 1 bone loss, and a saliva genetic test thing (sorry, I don't know the terminology) shows I have some genetic factor for high inflammation and bone resorption. Lol, AFTER I took the test, a relative let me know that autoimmune disease does run in the family, so I'm apparently at a high risk for reinfection. I'd like to start treatment ASAP, and go with an office that's equipped to help me manage things long term. 

Would you go with: 

1. Cooporate dentist office that diagnosed me. This was my first visit with them, so I don't have that multi-year trust and attachment. I recently read something in this forum where a hygienist said they would have referred an 8mm pocket with bone loss to a specialist. This dentist did not do that, but offered traditional scaling and a laser decontamination. Their website does not include what types of procedures they do, but they're a corporate office, so I assume they're able to do a lot? 

2. An office with a periodontist who has 25 years of experience. Their website does not include what type of procedures they're equipped to handle. 

3. An office that does not mention having a periodontist, but does have two individuals with a""doctor of dental surgery"" each. Their office does list some of the procedures they offer, and is the only one that does LANAP. I'm very interested in LANAP, but I also worry that people who specialize in surgery might recommend surgeries I don't necessarily need. 

I'm scheduling a second opinion with either option 2 or option 3. Not to question the diagnosis, but to make sure I don't need something more intensive. I don't want to do scaling only to find out I could have been a LANAP candidate and could have used the money to go towards that procedure, or find out that I actually needed surgery and have to go back for more work that could have been done all at once. IDK.  

Anyway, please forgive my ignorance. My family couldn't afford dental care until I was a teenager, so there are a lot of things I don't know about oral hygiene that I didn't know that I didn't know. I had never even heard of perio until the dentist diagnosed me with it. I didn't learn proper flossing technique until my 20s, and I had no idea I was brushing with the wrong technique until 2 days ago. I always thought my teeth were yellow because of coffee stains, but after learning the right way to brush, my teeth are already whiter. I literally want to cry, lol. 

Looking back, it really sucks that all the hygienists I'd gone to in the past (as an adult) probably thought I didn't care about my oral hygiene, when really, I was just a well-intentioned idiot with an overreactive immune response. (And an anxiety disorder, lol, so during appointments I probably came off as if I didn't care, when really I was just trying not to have a panic attack). 

If you have any other advice I'm all ears. It got this bad because of improper home care (mostly due to ignorance), and putting off finding a new dentist. Now I'm trying to give myself the internet 101 class on home care, and from now on I'll be sure to stick to a dental visit schedule even when/if I have to switch dentists for whatever reason.",1,1763318621.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

1oytigs,https://www.reddit.com/r/weyler/comments/1oytigs/tyler_and_wednesday_just_needs_the_confession_an/,Tyler and Wednesday Just Needs The Confession (an in-depth analysis and predictions for s3),"One of the main arguments of people who are not Weyler shippers is that: “Tyler was only pretending to be interested in Wednesday because Thornhill put him under a spell. He was manipulating her.”

Remember in season one, Tyler gets upset with Wednesday because he’s confused about her feelings towards him, and tells her “give me a call when I move up your to-do list.” (Remember this, because Tyler getting frustrated at Wednesday for not being direct about her feelings is a core sentiment he has.) 

There was conflict started by Tyler, which would be antithetical to Thornhill’s objectives. I don’t see any reason why a fake relationship or pure manipulation would have this conflict, especially one which Tyler risks Wednesday brushing his emotions off and moving on (something he knows is a real possibility). 

Tyler is tortured by Wednesday but doesn’t transform into the Hyde. He experiences pure heartbreak. I think at this point, he genuinely does not understand he’s the Hyde. Or there is a split personality, and this is the last time we see Tyler before his psyche is taken over by Hyde’s psyche and Thornhill’s commands. I think this is akin to Bianca’s siren song (the Hyde cannot disobey the commands of the master). 

Fast forward to season 2, Tyler and Wednesday see each other for the first time in months at the hospital. Part of Wednesday wants to see if the old Tyler, the boy who enthusiastically would “engage” her, is still there. Tyler however, seems to have no patience with Wednesday’s mixed signals (remember season 1), and Tyler wants Wednesday to confess her feelings for him. Tyler probably also feels that Wednesday was using him the whole time to help herself solve her mysteries and wants her to say otherwise. Wednesday does not want to confess, unsurprisingly, so Tyler finds another way to get her attention (threaten Enid, someone she loves and who saved her, and Tyler is probably jealous of their dynamic). 

It is important to mention here that Tyler is highly intelligent and witty. He understands and anticipates her well. Wednesday knows this and falls in love with him (but is also threatened by him) for this reason. This is why getting betrayed by him in season 1 and getting asked how it felt ""to lose"" stung so bad. She was not tricked, but she was outmaneuvered, and he gloats about it. This is also why in the hospital, he feels the need to say that she is not the smartest person in the room and she only won because she is ""lucky."" 

Now that Tyler has a very strong power, he has escaped the grasp of his master, Wednesday thinks that the real Tyler is an intelligent but pitiful boy who is just vying for novelty and attention. This is why she unleashes her scathing monologue about the “real him.” Wednesday doesn’t fully understand Hyde psyche at this point and we see her learn more about his lack of free will later on. (Perhaps she wants to master Tyler’s Hyde to see who the real Tyler is — is it the boy in the coffee shop or the Tyler unleashed by Thornhill?) Wednesday realizes the boy who once courted her by engaging her and matching her wit is not there. But she misinterprets why that boy is no longer there. 

Tyler realizes Wednesday does not understand what is happening in his head (another possible reason why he tells her she is not the smartest in the room). And I think he is perhaps still under (and fighting) Thornhill’s commands to hate/kill Wednesday. Maybe we will see in season 3 what exactly he was commanded to do. Again, I think the impact of the hyde-master is similar to a siren command. We see the power of the master’s command very briefly when Francois commands that he not transform and Tyler instantly obeys, to his own fear and detriment. 

Cut to the final episode. Wednesday is buried, Tyler is in shock. He doesn’t want her to die but he also doesn’t want his mother to die. But he also trusts Wednesday will survive somehow (others have speculated he sensed Agnes, a real possibility). Then, Tyler is betrayed by his mother. When Tyler sees Wednesday as he is being electrocuted, he doesn’t seem surprised that Wednesday is still alive. He is very surprised, however, that she slices his bond. Throughout the series, we see Tyler in chains. Wednesday puts an axe to the chain, symbolically and literally freeing him. He knows that Wednesday does not miss, and that she freed him on purpose. 

He asked her to kill him, and she instead saves him. His shock in the moment is shock the realization that she possibly does love him. Notice how earlier, when Pugsley is being used as bait, Tyler correctly says ""Wednesday will know she is being played"" but Isaac comments that an Addams will never sacrifice one of their own. So Tyler underestimated the extent to which sacrificial, morbid, and unconditional love is actually part of the Addams family dynamic. When Wednesday frees Tyler instead of killing him, he begins to understand this. Next season, however, we’ll probably both see them in denial about this, Tyler/Wednesday both saying that it created a useful distraction.

Tyler declares he is done with masters. Unfortunately, the new Hyde formation will probably be a cult. Maybe Tyler will have another love interest (another Hyde) and we’ll see Wednesday get jealous. The Hyde cult won’t be what Tyler thought it would be, Wednesday will probably free him (for the third time). 

Tyler struggles with self-control and Wednesday is very self-controlled. The unique magic of their relationship is that they both do not want to be controlled by other people and they do not want to control one another (although Wednesday wanted to master his Hyde, what this relationship would have looked like is up in the air).  

Maybe third time is the charm and we get the confession we (and Tyler) have been waiting for. 

TLDR; Tyler’s behavior can’t be dismissed as simple manipulation or Thornhill’s control. His frustration, conflict, and heartbreak show his feelings for Wednesday were real. Much of his hostility in season 2 comes from confusion, lingering Hyde commands, and believing Wednesday used him. Wednesday misreads him because she doesn’t yet understand the Hyde’s lack of free will. When she frees him instead of killing him, Tyler realizes she might actually care. Their dynamic is driven by mutual miscommunication, intelligence, and fear of being controlled—setting up a season 3 where both finally confront their real feelings.",8,1763318564.0,weyler,1,1.0,False

1oythlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/hysterectomy/comments/1oythlf/my_recovery_journey/,My Recovery Journey,"Hi all - 

I’m posting this because I’m 5 days post-op and recovering so much better than I anticipated thanks to A LOT of googling and honestly chatgbt which knows me like a lot more than it should. I wanted to share because all of things have helped me SO much and I’m already feel back to myself and all the girls I’ve asked who have had it couldn’t remember what they did so I just wanted a place for people to be able to find easily for recovery all the things that worked for me. 

Specifically I still have my ovaries so it was not as invasive as it could have been either, important to note as well as I didn’t have any growths or anything and I took to the medication pretty well. I don’t want to say this will work for everyone because I have literally no idea. I am relatively healthy, I have a sedentary job as well so I honestly don’t move around a whole lot during the week other than some random yoga classes and I do hike randomly on the weekends as well. I’m also perpetually dehydrated and drink like 3-5 cups of coffee a day. And maybe like 1 meal a day normally. Okay so like not super healthy but I do look like I’m healthy. Looks can be deceiving 😂 okay anyways. Now you know more about me and know that I’m not some fitness person who is like in the best shape ever and such. I am relatively flexible but not like a lot flexible but I do also think this has helped with recovery so maybe yoga beforehand too? 

Here’s what I’ve figured out so far: 

1. Since I don’t drink a lot of water most weeks, I made sure to drink at least 2 of my owalla’s 4 days leading up and then I got in 3.5 of it the day before surgery. So I was much more hydrated than I normally am. I think this made me more bloated but I also do think it has helped with recovery. I’ve kept this up this whole time and I literally had a coffee as soon as I was out of recovery because I needed that shit to pee. They wouldn’t let me leave until I peed and I was like well I know what makes me pee. Get me my freaking coffee. It worked and I peed and we got to go home. 

1.5. Post surgery I spent the day of surgery with a heating pad constantly on my belly after I got home but I stayed laid up with pillows so I was at like a 45 degree angle like I was at the hospital and just had a bunch of pillows around me and also j was holding a pillow. I laid on my couch too because it kind of forced me more so to sit more up so I wasn’t laying flat. It just felt like physics and gravity would help because I wanted to push out gas sooo bad but you literally can’t strain or push, it’s against the rules and I wasn’t trying to break the rules and die. I coughed that day and literally thought I was going to die. Just a forewarning because I’ve seen coughing is good for you and I’ll say this, I literally have been forcing myself to clear my throat instead because everytime I cough I feel like I’m going to die. Horrid whoever told me to cough. NOT NICE. I also have a small bounce ball for working out that I never use and I put that under my legs and that helped with some relief when I wanted to lay flat. My fiancé helped me A LOT this day. He was helping me walk and I was putting a lot of weight on him. 

2. On day 2 I literally did bed rot for most of the day with again my heating pad and sitting up with pillows all around me. I couldn’t feel when I had to pee so I kept getting my fiancé to help me pee so I was introducing more and more movement early on because the nurses were like move or you’ll regret it. Which the last thing I wanted to do was move. I was prescribed oxy and the stool softener so I was taking that but I was so bloated it was actually insane. Felt like I couldn’t breathe but I stayed sitting up 45 degree angle (idk if that’s right honestly but like whatever the angle is that’s like not 90 but leaning back). Then around like 5pm I was like okay I’m ready to walk around the house. And we have stairs and the night before I thought I was going to die going up the stairs, my fiancé had to basically carry me because I was like wtf did these people do to me. I mean thank you for not having to deal with what I was but damn. But going down wasn’t so bad with his help. Still painful but I actually made sure to use both sides going down the stairs and I think that helped me push out some gas because I could feel that it was gas pain in my stomach and everytime I’d sit weird my left side felt like it was about to explode. Felt like I was having contractions. It was a wild amount of pain. Anyways I then was walking around a ton around my living room, just doing laps. I mean very slow laps and then use my couch to put my hands down so I was leaning over like the tiniest bit and swung my hips back and forth. That’s when the first gas was passed and it sounded like a balloon deflating. Not loud but so long and wildly amazing. So I just kept doing that until it was bedtime and we went back upstairs, while on the way I got another one out, thank you stairs. And I decided the stairs also help. And then I got my heating pad and had that on me all night. Mine is like the bean bag one so it also has some weight to it which I find really really comforting on my belly right now. 

3. The next day I walked around A LOT. I went outside and walked around my neighborhood and when I wasn’t walking around and honestly even when I was, I was using the heating pad. I stopped the oxy after this day but a lot of moving around and the side to side motion worked soooo well. But still no poo. I was getting frustrated because I was passing gas but not enough. And I was still super bloated but no poo. But I did basically all of that over and over all day and did get some gas out which felt literally amazing. New woman. 

4. The next day we left the house for the first time and went over to my fiancée’s parents house. They have a lot of land so I walked around while he was working on some things and lo and behold. It was time. I had to do a lot of deep breathing but I got it out finally and it was just a small log but it was glorious. I felt like I lost a lb. Btw I stopped taking the oxy as well because the day before around bedtime I started getting that loopy feeling so I knew it was time to stop and I think this was the key. So I was just doing the stool softener and the ibuprofen at this point. One in the morning and one at night. After that I got a bunch of gas out and I continued having the heating pad on me near constantly and taking move around breaks where I’d get up and pace around the house and do my little bend with arms on the couch and swinging hips side to side but not swinging just like swaying. I was able to sleep slightly on my right side propped up on pillows and that also helped push some gas out. I slept sooo good. That was last night. Again the heating pad all night. That thing has been a literal life saver. We also went to eat at a Mexican restaurant that night because I thought for sure that would help. It didn’t that day but I do think it helped the next day. 

5. Now we’re caught up to today. Today I knew I wanted to get out of the house and my fiancé was literally dying to get out because he can’t sit still. I can sit for days and never leave the house but he is constantly moving around and doing things. Our house has never been more clean than it is right now. But anyways I wanted to get out and he rides dirt bikes so we found a park with a good bathroom because girls don’t really come so I knew the girls would be clean but we’ve been here before. Plus my dad also rides dirt bikes so the sound of them is like weirdly comforting to me like me being in my childhood bathroom with the sound of my bad cranking up his dirt bike in the garage underneath. Just very cathartic honestly but I digress as I don’t know that people will have access to this. But anyways I woke up this morning and before I even had my coffee the poo came out. It was magical truly but still just a small log (thank you Mexican food). So we get out here to the dirt bike park and my fiancé brought all sorts of things for me. I have a portable rocking chair but it’s like cocoon shaped sort of and then a chair for my feet to rest in. Worth noting I’m obsessed with the nerd gummies and he’s supplied me with sooo many bags and I’ve been eating them. I’ve also been eating relatively normally. My fiancé cooks most if not all of our meals so he’s been making me any food I request and it’s been great. I didn’t realize I was supposed to be eating bland until I saw it yesterday night but it was too late for that. So anyways we parked near the bathrooms under a tree I got my set up. I’ve been rocking in my chair and taking walking breaks and I’m pleased to report that I’ve gotten 2 separate little logs out. 4 so far since surgery on day 5, day 4 post op. But here was the secret, I asked my ChatGPT for help. I was in the bathroom and was like okay I can feel it needs out. It won’t come what do I do. And she said (yes she’s a she, I’d tell you her name but that would really out me) fix your posture, no slouching, take 5 deep breaths, then start shhhing like your shhhing a baby and hold your belly. And man did that work. A girl came into the bathroom while I was shhing and I didn’t even care because it was happening for me. Small but mighty gains. I don’t have the whole can’t go in public situation. But I am very clean with it. I brought toilet pads, my own toilet paper, wet wipes and booty wipes. I normally use my bidet but since you’re not allowed to get in the bath, I figured that was also off limits. Yes I have a portable bidet as well. Listen, it’s amazing. Once you do it you’ll never go back. 

This is my journey so far! I just wanted to share because why tf not. Maybe it’ll make people feel a little more human and a little less alone. Maybe nobody will see this or read this. That’s completely fine too. Idk how many of my friends are on Reddit but if they are it’ll be prettyyyy obvious it’s me but I’m an open book and not a one would be surprised by me posting this. 

Worth also noting, I’m 34, I don’t have any other health complications. I have had one child and it was a regular birth albeit traumatic for me as she was huge and I did tear quite a bit. And this is when my period started being really bad. Nobody could give me the answers as to why, they just kept trying to bandaid it with medicine that would then in turn stop the symptoms but give me other symptoms. I’m pretty short  5 ft and petite but I’ve gained some weight recently and was like 123 lbs whenever I got the surgery. 

I’ll edit as I continue to heal but I’m feeling so much better today and I think all of these factor into why! So I wanted to share in case it helped someone. I am definitely not back to normal, I’m walking like a grandma still and I’m not putting any strain or doing anything I shouldn’t be doing yet. 

If you’ve gone through it share what helped you and you are concerned about anything or want to ask questions, ask!! Hopefully SOMEONE will be able to answer if I can’t!

1oytgho,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1oytgho/alternate_funnels/,Alternate Funnels,"These recent “mod” posts are entertaining. The “de-integrated” architecture of the Moccamaster makes it ideal for reducing to a hot water dispenser and gives you something more to play with in the coffee obsession. So the recent post we got off on the size of the drip hole which started me experimenting.

If you run water with no coffee or filter through the moccaamaster the water immediately drips through. It doesn’t accumulate. I am no expert in fluid dynamics but I think that means that it is designed for extraction time to be determined solely by filter paper and grind size. Flow rate from the boiler is also a factor of course but that’s fixed.

This means the size of the hole of any dripper you choose will not impact the brew compared to the included funnel as long as it is at least the size of the one included with the moccamaster (7mm). This would explain why people successfully brew with a V60. If you use the same filter, coffee mass, and grind size, theoretically the brew would be exactly the same with any funnel with a drip hole 7mm or larger.

Anyone think of a reason why this could be wrong?",2,1763318436.0,Moccamaster,2,1.0,False

1oytf28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenRelationships/comments/1oytf28/dating_with_intent/,Dating with intent,"Hi! this is really long.. 

Female - early thirties. 

I don't know if I'm looking for advices or just to talk. 

Let me preface with: I do therapy. I've been in therapy for the past two years and half, following an abusive relationship that ended in extreme violence. 
I know I have trust issues big time (not only with people but with life in general - as it's hard for me to believe that someone could be interested in me) but I also I know that I'm doing my work and I'm here trying!

Been out of my last of my relationship for 2.5 years. Dated briefly someone for 2-3 months earlier this year, but I knew it wouldn't go anywhere really serious. 

I don't date around or really sleep around. Usually takes me a bit (5-6 dates) before sleeping with someone. 

I would say I date with intent. I'm looking to truly built a connection with someone, and after being abused it can be hard, and it's difficult for me to feel safe, but I'm trying. 

Fast forward. Matched with a guy on an app at the end of October. Good chats, he was always slow to answer (sometimes 24hrs), and he travels quite often for work. Gave him my number to facilitate communication.

Went on a first date. Coffee and a walk. On my end I instantanely felt a connection. Vibes were just flowing naturally, we walked around and talked for 2-3 hours. Similar values, quite similar upbringing, lots of common personality traits, both looking for something serious. He mentioned being more on the introvert side though. He is a few years older.
Asked me out on a second date (dinner) at the end of the first one and we set-up a day right away.

Exchanged a few messages after the date to decide on a place and time. He made the res and made sure it was a place I would enjoy (I had told him abt some of my intolerances). 

Again - still a bit slow with texting - which I'm okay with, better than being love bombed. 

Our texting is not matching as he would text more at the end of the day and I text more during the day. 
He would sometimes leave me on read also.

2nd date, we meet around 7pm, go for drinks after and split around 2.30am.. it was such a good time. Great chats, felt truly natural, and I felt like I was out for drinks with a friend, because it felt really safe. Waited for me to grab the taxi, and while waiting he kissed me. Not once but several times for a good 5-10minutes. During the date we had set-up that we would go to an escape game as a third date. 

We exchanged a few messages before bed and the next day to decide which escape game to go to. 

Not a lot of messages during the week. I texted him briefly to confirm that I had reserved the escape game reservation and time we had to be there at. 
He can go days without texting me and I'm mostly the one initiating conversations. To the point I was thinking he was ghosting me. We don't really have conversations though. Our texts are now only to confirm we made it home after a date or confirming the next date. 

Escape game went well - he hasn't gone to many before.
Great communication - we both weren't scared to ask for clues.
We joked around after that we need to do another one, but easier so we can have an easy win and progress from that. Yes he mentioned wanting to do more escape games with me.

We went for a quick dinner after.
I asked him if he was a big texter, to which he laughed. And I said ""I don't mind the not texting 24/7, but leaving me on read.."" and he agreed it was not cool. And mentioned he will be better at not leaving me on read. He also mentioned that he gets lost scrolling on social media often. 

Dinner was super cool - he drove me home after. In the car ride I mentionned being happy taking things slow because I know that good things takes time to build up, and I'm dating with intent. He agrees. 
Drop me home, and before leaving I ask I should kiss him. To which he asks back ""do you want to kiss me?"" And I said ""do you want me to kiss you?"" To which he replied ""a little bit yeah"" and laughed.
We ended up sharing a few kisses. Which I really like.

Texted me before bed saying he had a lot of fun and that we will be better at the next escape game. I replied mentioning that I really enjoy spending time with him. To which he said he has fun too in our dates, and again mentioned being better at the next escape game. 

I know he is going to be super busy travelling for work the next 3 weeks. When he mentioned that I said ""so I won't see you for 3 weeks?!"" To which he answered that we will find time to meet in between. 

Texted him back last night. No answer - messages not opened. 

So.. 
I obviously like the guy. It is super hard for me to connect with men in general. I don't go to do 3 dates with someone if I'm not interested. I rarely even go to a second date with someone.

I don't do the multi dating thing. If I'm interested in someone and feeling the vibe I don't feel like talking to anyone else.
But I'm also so scared of getting hurt that I'm starting to feel that the lack of texting is a lack of interest and I'm here thinking I should pull the plug. We don't have a next date set-up. 
I just know that when we do have a date, I'm always super excited to see him. It feels natural and comfy to spend time with him. 

I know there is a lot that goes with trusting the process and trusting that what is meant for you will find you.
But I'm in head (obviously) and scared to be hurt - because again, it's hard for me to have interest in a guy. And I also know that if I never give it a chance I'll never know. 
Im also doing lots on myself and I finally found peace with who I am (although I require work like everyone). I don't like to play games - never ghosted anyone - I don't lead on men who show interest in me - and I'm really clear with my intentions when it comes to dating. 

Anyone been in my shoes and has advices?

I buy her food, coffees, I make her meals every day with my groceries, I try my best to take care of her and do pretty much anything she asks.

On the other hand, my girlfriend is SO stingy. She doesn’t spend much money in general, not even on me. At the store this morning, I asked her to buy $3 chocolate syrup since she wanted chocolate milk, and she immediately said no. I spent almost my entire paycheck yesterday on birthday gifts for my mom and brother and cat food. And she has HUNDREDS in her account. And she can’t buy freaking chocolate syrup?

I think this made me so upset because it feels like i’m unimportant to her, or not worth spending money on. I need little gestures like a coffee, a little surprise, or buying something small that I want when I have nothing in my account.

To add to this, I was spoiled rotten in my last relationship. She did everything for me, never let me spend money, regularly went out and bought me things just because. I don’t expect my current girlfriend to do that, but I just expect her to reciprocate I think.

But I'm very in my head about the woman I buy coffee from. 
She's soft butch in how she dresses and she always smiles when she sees me come in. 

But I only see her when I go to buy coffee. So asking her out during work hours, as someone who's worked retail before, seems like a line I shouldnt step across, I remember just being in a haze trying to keep up with customers. 

Just for clarity, the coffee is expensive and tastes absolutely horrible but thats just how the cafe makes it. So I'm not afraid of asking her out because I love the coffee there, I'm afraid incase she personally would hate me for asking her out during work. 

But I do want to ask her out. 
We're close in age and she laughs at my jokes which I know isn't massive but it's something. 
So how do I do this in a way where it remains respectful + I can just get out of her hair if she says no?

As a local, I've scoured the valley to bring you a comprehensive list of fantastic, affordable (or at least *reasonably priced* for Napa!) restaurants, cafes, and hidden gems from the bustling streets of Napa all the way up to charming Calistoga.

   * *Price Point:* $$-$$$



# Tips for Saving Money on Food in Napa Valley:



* **Picnics are Your Best Friend:** Many wineries allow picnics (check ahead!). Grab provisions from Oxbow Market, Oakville Grocery, or even a local supermarket (Safeway/Trader Joe's in Napa).
* **Hit Up Lunch Menus:** Often, the same high-quality restaurants will have significantly cheaper lunch menus than dinner.
* **Happy Hour Deals:** Keep an eye out for happy hour specials, especially in Napa and Calistoga, for discounted drinks and appetizers.
* **Breweries & Taprooms:** Places like Fieldwork Brewing in Napa sometimes have food trucks or more casual food options.
* **Share Plates:** If dining at a slightly nicer spot, consider ordering a few appetizers or small plates to share instead of individual entrees.
* **Stay Hydrated (with water!):** Buying bottled water adds up. Carry a reusable bottle and fill it up.



\*\*Please remember to not drive while wine tasting. If you need to hire a designated driver, please check out **Ride Eaze** at [www.rideeaze.com](http://www.rideeaze.com) or **(707) 458-1073**, as they are an excellent local option\*\*",2,1763318100.0,NapaValleyConcierge,0,1.0,False

Had mutual attraction with a researcher during my internship but never acted on it. Months later I still can’t stop thinking about him, and the only way to reach him now is work Slack/email. Not sure if reaching out is appropriate.

I (23F) have developed interest in a early 30-something guy working at a university research lab. We met while I was doing an internship project under a different professor (so not directly working with / under him). He showed interest in getting to know me and signs of attraction that he poorly tried to hide. He always sat next to me during lunch breaks (even showing some dissapointment when he was not able to), his eyes were always on me when we were in the same room and his face would light up if he entered a room an noticed I was there. Despite all this, it was rare for us to directly engage in conversation with each other, only participating in the same group conversations.

I noticed his interest and I felt (feel) an attraction to him, but didn't act on it during my time at the lab. There were several reasons for this. Most importantly, I felt really depressed during my internship had no confidence, lost my sense of self and had too little energy and confidence to be social (also a reason why we never directly talked). I think this also made any romantic attraction I felt less intense. My mental state ultimately led me to the decision to quit my internship and start working part-time instead. Additionally, I was unsure how I felt about our age difference. Lastly, I don't have any experience romantically so I wasn't sure how to approach in the first place.

My internship ended in May. Now months later, I cannot get him out of my head and my attraction towards him has only increased. I really want to talk to him and get to know him better. Everytime I spot him around campus I feel a rush. It's rare for me to be interested in anyone, let alone be attracted to somebody in this way and it feels impossible to not act upon.

However, I have no way to contact him other than Slack and his work email and running into him is difficult because the research lab offices are at a different floor of the university building. I know he goes to get lunch at the cafeteria everyday but eats it in the research lab break room.  Sometimes I see him arrive at campus in the morning but he leaves very late in the evening.

Ideally, I would run into him accidentally and we could start some small talk and I could give him my number. Realistically, this is unlikely to happen naturally. I could approach him via his work email or Slack but this feels slightly inappropriate to do and I'm not sure what I could even tell him (ask to have a coffee sometimes or directly offer my number).

she eventually put me on spirinolactone 25 mg to ease me into it. she said she couldn’t put me on metformin because my a1c was normal and my blood sugar wasn’t showing any signs of irregularity. after realizing this, i started to go back on a healthier diet for the last 2 weeks. the months leading up to this, i was constantly craving sweets, drank coffee every morning, i felt like i couldn’t go through the day without these things. even though i knew, that i should have. but even before that, i was going through a healthy diet and gave up after months of feeling completely defeated. so does it eventually get better? i just don’t know what else to do. and i know that weight is a physical attribute that shouldn’t get in the way of your happiness but i guess a part of me just feels very insecure in that aspect. i truly do want to be the best version of myself & i know that others have got it so much worse & i feel for them after reading these posts. pcos honestly sucks, and i’m sorry for those who genuinely have dealt with it their whole lives. but anyway, thanks for reading if you’ve gotten this far.",1,1763317929.0,PCOS,1,0.99,False

Also, please stay with me until the end before commenting!
Note: this is not my first massage. I usually get one every couple of months, and this one was definitely different.

I (F32) stayed at a spa/hotel for a week recently. I work remotely for a company in a different state, and I work in their time zone, so I would usually hike in the morning, get back to the hotel around 1 PM, chill in the common spa area until 3 PM, and then start working from 3 PM to 11 PM. I normally take calls in my hotel room after the spa closes around 7 PM.

Fridays are usually no-call days for my company and I have more flexibility, so when Friday came I decided to get an 80 minute massage at noon. When I arrived at the spa, the masseuse (F, probably around 40) introduced herself, asked what scent I wanted, asked if there was anywhere I did not like to be touched, whether she could touch my hair, and whether there was anything she should know about my body (scars, trauma, etc). I told her I had no off limits zones and that I run a lot. She took me to the massage room, gave me those paper thong-like panties, asked me to put them on and lie on the table, and gave me a couple minutes of privacy. I did what she asked.

When she came back in, she started the massage on my shoulders with amazing smelling cacao wax. She moved down my back and pulled the panties down under my butt cheeks. I immediately panicked a little inside because I am kind of shy, but everything still felt professional. She continued the massage, getting into my glutes, but it started feeling a bit sexual to me. She was not really working on knots or muscles (even though I told her not to be afraid to use strong pressure). She was mostly caressing me intensely. She stayed on my butt for a while and placed her hand flat on my cheeks (perpendicular to the crack) and gently moved it left and right. That pressure and movement made my front rub against the table and it felt nice, but I tried to fight the feeling because she is a professional and I did not want it to feel that good. I even wondered if I had accidentally booked the wrong type of massage because she would go back to my butt quite a lot— but this was a 4 star superior hotel and there is no way that was an option. 

She then moved to my arms and intertwined her fingers with mine like we were holding hands. She would also sigh deeply every once in a while, close to my ears. She massaged my legs and inner thighs, though nothing extreme there. Then she did my head, running her fingers through my hair and lightly pulling it. These are normal massage techniques, but again there was a sensuality behind it I cannot explain.

She whispered in my ear to slowly turn around, so I did, eyes closed. She placed a paper band over my eyes, but I could see a bit under it if I opened them. She poured more wax and gently massaged me again. She slowly reached my chest, and from under the eye mask I could see how close she was. I could see her lips and feel her breath on mine(!!). I started taking deeper breaths as she rubbed my chest. She never fully went on my nips, but she got close enough that I could absolutely feel her there, as she might touch her with the side of her hands. Most massages I get do not even go near the chest, and some skip it entirely. She breathed loudly and sensually, and her lips were so close to my face.

She went back to my arms, intertwined our fingers again, and guided them so that at one point I felt like I was hugging her with both arms. She moved to my belly, sliding under the panties but not too far. Once she did my legs, she opened them so my knees fell outward and did not spend much time on my calves or quads. Again the whole thing felt like intentional caressing. This went on for an hour and a half, and I felt some sexual tension in the room, but I also did not want to assume anything if she was simply very passionate about her job.

When the massage was over she whispered softly in my ear, called me by my name, and said, “This was so special. I will give you some time for yourself now and I will see you outside.” I stayed lying down for about 20 seconds in shock, trying to process what happened, then quickly got up, got dressed, and went out. She saw me and stopped me saying, “Oh no, I thought you were going to take a little longer. Wait, let me offer you some tea!” I followed her into a room, she gave me some tea, and she told me, “(My name), this was such a pleasure for me. It was amazing and you are truly beautiful., your body is beautiful. I really hope I can do it again.” I panicked and said something like, “Yeah, I could not stay longer, I need to work. It was amazing though, thank you.” She asked, “Oh, so you are going away from the hotel now?” I said no, but that I work remotely from my room so I had to go. She said, “Please do not work too much, and you should come at 3 to the Turkish bath where I will host a coffee scrub.” I thanked her again and went to my room, still in shock. She had told me I was beautiful and that she hoped to do it again. I decided to go to the scrub because at that point I was developing a crush on this lady.

The scrub was in a nude Turkish bath in the hotel, but I decided to let go of my shyness and go for it. She saw me and said, “Are you joining?” with a big smile, and I said yes. She touched my arm and said she was so happy I came. There were 6 naked people in there. She gave each of us a small glass of the coffee scrub she made and guided us through scrubbing ourselves while she performed a ritual from my home country. It involved agitating a cloth or large fan to make the heat more bearable, almost like a choreographed dance. It lasted about 15 minutes. At one point she came up to me (and only me) and asked, “Do you want help scrubbing your back?” I said, “Yes please,” and she said, “How nice, I get to cuddle you once more.” She did it for about a minute, then ended the ritual. We all showered, I thanked her again, and went back to my room to work.

I had to leave early the next morning and did not see her again. Now I am sad because I wanted to ask for her number, but I did not because I worried I might be imagining that she was hitting on me. Maybe she was just doing her job. I tried looking her up on Instagram through the hotel’s page, followers, and following, but I could not find her. There is one private profile that might be her, but I do not want to be creepy, and I am doubting the whole interaction because maybe I read too much into it. HELP. was she or was she not hitting on me? what should i do? the only way to see her again is going there again but the hotel is pretty expensive plus the massage was also expensive… :’(

I finally finished the setup I've been planning for a while. I don't plan on changing anything else, at least until something breaks.

**The Setup:**

* **Machine:** MiiCoffee Apex V2
* **Grinder:** MiiCoffee DF54
* **Organization (3D):** Coffee Blocks project (from Printables), serving as a Tamper Station + Organizer + Knock Box.

There are clearly a lot of 3D-printed projects here, from an angled base for the grinder to even a 49mm base I made for my Muvna Tamper, which I needed to work with the Step Down Basket I bought.

I live in Brazil, so my entire setup is either from AliExpress or imported via Amazon (Grinder and Machine).

1oysygu,https://www.reddit.com/r/jordan/comments/1oysygu/took_jett_bus_to_petra_from_amman_quick_review/,Took JETT bus to Petra from Amman : quick review for anyone planning," just did the day trip to Petra using the JETT bus and sharimg it for the future travellers

Booking: Did it online through their website (jett.com.jo). Pretty straightforward, got a confirmation email with the qr
 Booked like a week before my trip

Pickup: They have two options - Abdali station or 7th Circle. I did Abdali since it was closer to my hotel. Easy to find, just showed up 15 mins early.
Timing: Bus left exactly on time at 6:30 AM. Got to Petra around 10.40 AM. Came back on the 5 PM bus, reached Amman byo
 9:10 PM. Both times on schedule which was nice.
The ride: Bus was comfortable enough. AC worked, seats recline a bit, clean. I slept through most of it honestly. They stop for 20 mins each way at this rest area - bathroom break and you can grab coffee or snacks.
Cost: Around 20 JOD round trip. Way cheaper than the tour packages which are like 90-110 JOD for basically the same thing.
Time at Petra: Had from 11 AM to 5 PM there. That's 6 hours which was more than enough to see everything, including hiking up to the Monastery (which you should absolutely do btw).
Overall: Would recommend if you're doing Petra as a day trip. It's reliable, way cheaper than tours, and gives you the flexibility to do your own thing at Petra instead of being stuck with a group.
Front seats are better if you get motion sick. Bring water and some snacks. That's about it.
Happy to answer questions if anyone's planning this.",1,1763317269.0,jordan,0,1.0,False
1oyswzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalsMood/comments/1oyswzk/10_study_hacks_for_every_student/,10 Study Hacks for Every Student,"As a new semester ramps back up, students are settling into a routine filled with lectures, clinical and studying. Pursuing your program of study requires hard work. To make it across the stage at graduation, students pour lots of determination and sacrifice into their schooling. Knowing how to study is a large part of successfully making it through your program. Baptist Health College Little Rock has 10 study hacks every student should know to help them through their program. Use these hacks and get the most out of your study time. 

 

**1. Review content every day.**

At the end of the day, take an hour or 30 minutes to review the content you learned. Don’t wait until the days leading up to an exam to cram information. Set aside time to look over your notes and re-read material. As you review, take into consideration the content you had a difficult time understanding. Make this a priority in your daily study time to ensure you understand it leading up to the exam. 

 

**2. Ask questions when you don’t understand.** 

As you review content, seek help and clarification when you don’t understand a concept. Utilize your faculty and their office hours to ask them your questions. Seek help from other peers as well. Collaborating with others can also help lead to understanding. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!

 

**3. Know your learning style.** 

Knowing your learning style will help you get the most out of your studying. Capitalize on this so you can retain information. Do you learn better with flashcards or do you prefer to listen to audio from lectures? If you are a verbal learner, reviewing content with a group might be the best option for you. Look for ways that meet your learning needs. 

 

**4. Block out your calendar.** 

Treat studying like a job. Block out time in your schedule that is dedicated to studying. Avoid planning activities with friends or family so you can focus on knowing your content. As exam day draws near, you will need extra time in your schedule to study. Be sure to plan accordingly so you can devote adequate time to understanding content. 

 

**5. Stay organized and ahead of the game.** 

Look at your syllabus and write down all of your exams and assignments. Put this in your calendar because this will help you prepare and plan out when you need to study. Deadlines approach quickly, so manage your time well and give yourself enough time to study content and complete assignments without stress before test day. 

 

**6. Find a study space.** 

Create a space in your home where you can focus and concentrate well. This space will need a comfortable place to sit with good lighting. We recommend having a desk so you can have a place to spread out your books, assignments, notes and computer. Consider changing up your study space every once in a while. Maybe visit a coffee shop or outdoor location for a change in scenery during your study time. 

 

**7. Be undistracted.**

There are many distractions all around you that can prevent you from getting the most out of your study time. We recommend turning your phone on “do not disturb” and placing it outside of the room so you are not tempted to reach for it. Stay focused on the task at hand and check your phone periodically. If you live with others, they can also be a distraction. Find a quiet place to study and let them know that you are unavailable for a few hours so hopefully you can study without interruptions. 

 

**8. Take breaks.** 

No one likes staying stationary for hours on end. Taking breaks while studying can increase your productivity and help you reset so you can retain information. After a few hours, take a 5 to 30 minute break to reset and refocus. Consider going for a walk, stretching, eating a snack, running an errand or watching an episode of your favorite TV show to help you relax. 

 

**9. Fuel your brain.** 

While studying, avoid eating processed foods like chips, cookies and sweets. Instead, choose snacks that are whole foods like fruit, nuts, cheese sticks or dark chocolate if you are needing something sweet.

 

**10. Find a good study group.** 

As you prepare for exams, finding a good study group is another way to get the most out of your study time. Reviewing content with others allows you to test your knowledge, ask questions and solidify your understanding.

1oyswho,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1oyswho/delonghi_magnifica_evo_next_vs_rivelia/,Delonghi Magnifica Evo Next vs Rivelia.,"I see a lot of posts comparing the rivelia with the evo plus.  

Im interested in my fellow coffee lovers opinions on whether the rivelia is worth the extra money.

In the uk the evo next is 399.   It has a tft display and a few coffee options.   The rivelia had the sleek touch display more options and interchangeable hoppers.   But essentially do they both just make the same quality coffee?   The rievla is an extra 250.  So trying to figure out if it is worth it.   I like the idea of the hopper system but I could live without it.

The things I care about most are quality of the coffee/taste and ease of use/cleaning.

Interested to know your thoughts.

If you dont have a lot of experience with coffee, i seriously recommend visiting this type of event. You will learn bunch of stuff, meet crazy amount of cool people from the industry and your sensoric abilities will skyrocket. I had some experience before, but now i know almost without a doubt guess bunch of varieties and origins just by taste.

Sunday Sermon: 16 November 2025

Theme: The Unknown Host at the Last Supper

Message:

We read a verse so many times and then wonder about the verse. We start asking questions and in our modern times we are very fortunate that we can turn to Google and even seek answers there.

This week I read such a verse again. I went furthermore and searched a bit. The same story appears in three of the Gospels.The story plays out about 2025 years ago, in Jerusalem. No, not the Christmas story, but the day of the Last Supper.

We find the story in:

Matthew 26:18

And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.

Mark 14:13-15

And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.

And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.

Luke 22:10-12

And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.

 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?

And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.

The disciples want to prepare the Passover on the first day of unleavened bread. They come to Jesus and ask Him where He wants them to prepare the Passover. In Matthew, we read that Jesus sends them to a certain person. However, in Mark and Luke, we read a bit more about the person; it will be someone who meets them with a jar of water. The person will then take them to a house, and they must ask the owner where the room is where Jesus and the disciples can eat the Passover.

The information on Google claims that it could possibly be the young Mark whose house it was, and that the location of the house was possibly on the southern side of Mount Zion near the Church of the Dormition.

What is interesting, however, is that there is no mention of this house  before the day of the Passover. There is no prophecy about it.Why did this text verse make me think and sniff around?

If there is no prophecy about it, no mention before the time of the location, how did the owner of the house know to prepare the upper room for Jesus and the disciples?We can assume that the meal was prepared by the disciples but the room still had to be prepared, and it was also prepared.The house had to be cleaned, and there should have been no leaven in the house.

Thus, the owner of the house was ready for Jesus and the disciples. The unknown host was ready to receive Jesus at home. Everything was as ready as possible for Jesus' visit.

Are we ready to receive Jesus as a guest in our homes? Are we ready to do anything at any time for Jesus? Can we receive Jesus in our homes today without scrambling around? Is there a place for Jesus in our homes? Are our homes clean?Will we run around like a busy Martha when Jesus walks into our house, or will we be able to enjoy a cup of coffee with Jesus like Mary? Will we feel uncomfortable in Jesus' company and take out that fine porcelain tea set from Grandma? Will we perhaps be so comfortable in Jesus' company that we will just take out the ordinary coffee mugs?

How ready are we to receive Jesus today?

I was at Gregory’s on 71st earlier today, from 10:30 to 12ish, grabbing coffee with a friend, sitting at one of the tables against the wall. Now i wouldn’t say this was a missed connection of any sort, more just my curiosity. There was this guy sitting at the table behind me and we accidentally bumped heads because we leaned back in our chairs. But anyway, looked like he was waiting for someone with this sweet little gift basket, but he ended up leaving with it, no one ever met him at Gregory’s. Now I’m curious to know if he’s single LOL. He was cute IMO and I’m hoping he didn’t get stood up. But don’t know where he ended up going.

Again, know this is super weird to come on here but figured it’s worth the shot.

1oysu26,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1oysu26/rant/,Rant," I am writing 3 fics at once and my brain has left the chat 🤡🔥📚

HIIII so apparently I hate myself because I’m currently writing THREE fics across THREE fandoms and my brain is a crime scene. We’ve got: a Harry Potter time-travel ML/M romance (time is fake, canon is fake, my sanity is fake), a Peaky Blinders ML/M romance (everyone is brooding, smoking, trauma-dumping like it’s a sport), and a Glory-inspired Criminal Minds fic (non-romantic, dark as hell, basically my brain’s emotional support nightmare). And for some reason I thought: Yeah, let’s write all of these at the same time! 😂💀 Like??? Who allowed me internet access.

Every day I say “TODAY I WILL WORK ON ONE FIC” and immediately get mentally tackled by someone else’s fandom. HP characters are like [✨“Fix the timeline, babe”✨], Peaky Blinders gang is SCREAMING at me like [“WHERE’S OUR CHAPTER, LOVE?”], and the Criminal Minds team is silently judging me from a corner like disappointed guidance counselors. My brain? Currently hosting a chaotic crossover battle royale. I am merely the clown in the middle. 🤡🎪

Footnote 1: I have not slept since the invention of fanfiction.
Footnote 2: Coffee is a personality trait now.
Footnote 3: My drafts folder is a graveyard.
Footnote 4: My characters unionized. I have no rights.

So HELLO, multi-fandom writers of Reddit: HOW DO YOU DO THIS??? How do you write multiple fics, multiple genres, multiple emotional breakdowns WITHOUT spontaneously combusting??? Do you schedule? Rotate? Cry? Astral project? Bargain with eldritch fic gods??? Because I swear if one more character pops up in my brain asking for “just one more scene” I’m throwing myself into my own plot twist.

ANYWAY PLEASE SEND TIPS OR EXORCISM RITUALS THANK YOU. 😭🔥

Being caffeine free has been a great experience! More energy,  better sleep yadayada, but it's also been miserable as, well, theres more to coffee than caffeine. Lately I've been trying to make it work, with coffee replacements or golden milk or even decaf.​ None have scratched the itch, with decaf obviously coming closest, but I've yet to find a place that makes good decaf coffee

Its frustrating as decaf *can* be as good as regular, the issue starts with roasting though. All methods of decaffeination alter the porosity of the beans, which changes how one should roast them, so you need to have a roaster who cares enough to do it well. Unfortunately, it's a nasty cycle where roasters and cafes dont care about decaf because nobody orders it, and people dont ask for it because its either unavailable or poorly done. 

So, yeah, are there any roasters in the area that take pride in their decaf?​",6,1763316928.0,philly,4,0.88,False
