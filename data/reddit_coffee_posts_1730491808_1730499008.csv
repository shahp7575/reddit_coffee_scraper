I began with this speaker at the forward position or the geometric corner of the room, but it was too close to counter area so I’ve moved it back down the hall, and that fixed that problem but still I want better. 16’ ceiling and they really can’t be any lower than 12’ from the floor.

1ghh7zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1ghh7zq/online_dating_all_misses/,Online dating: All misses,"When you think about it, meeting a stranger online and having it lead to something meaningful would seem almost impossible. Yet here I am. Although I don't know if I'm cut out for the process.

First match: Had a glass of wine together and had a lot in common, but zero chemistry or attraction on my part. I put off a second date and communication fizzled.

Second match: We hit it off in message exchanges and arranged for a coffee date. Then his messages became overtly sexual. Considering we hadn't yet met, I told him that was weird and ended communication.

Third match (while on vacation in Australia): We went straight to phone calls and both of us immediately connected -- strongly. I had to fly home but we continued our conversations and even talked about me coming back and him coming to the U.S. But the 18-hour time difference made communication amost impossible. When his work day ended, it was midnight my time. His texts got shorter (breadcrumbing) so I suggested we set aside time for weekend phone dates. He agreed then stood me up for the phone date, saying he lost track of time. I broke it off the next day.

Fourth match: Younger man who seemed really interesting in our many message exchanges, but failed to call when we set a time to talk on the phone. He apologized. I broke off contact.

I should note that my history was never to go no-contact (maybe he was busy, maybe he didn't get my message, etc.), I've since learned that if a man wants to talk with you he'll make it happen, so I'm cutting my losses earlier now.

So I'm back to square one and thinking maybe OLD isn't the way to meet someone for a lasting relatiionship. The process takes a toll on one's self-esteem. I'm curious what folks here think.

I’d ideally find a temporary home for this, but was wondering where people would be interested in seeing this to start.

Ripe red fruits like red apple, strawberry. Rich milk chocolate/cocoa. tiny bit of pepper on the back of the palate. Not a long finish, but very pleasant.

She is too young, wants kids, in a coworker, but still…I think the flattery (she is actively chasing him) and someone that makes him feel good about himself is really hurting our marriage. 

We sobbed and held each other and made love the other night. He said he wasn’t sure this was the right choice, but he seems set on making it. He wants someone that treats him better than I do (to be clear, we are both full time, very busy, some mental health issues, kids with medical problems, past addictions issue with him) - all this is to say, I have stuck by him even at his lowest. And frankly, this is a huge wake-up call for me and I want and need to let go of the past and be a better human for him.

1. The chick at work is a problem. She brings him coffee, messages him all day long. Yes, he is encouraging it, but he told me he hasn’t crossed the physical ljne. I was thinking of sending her a kind note that basically said, “back off, you are breaking up a family”
2. Accept what he is saying, ask him to move out and move on with my life and co parent with him. 
3. Let things simmer down, see how he feels and I feel after a few weeks. Make decisions about what to do next.

My Vertuo Pop broke just after the end of its warranty and I switched to a Vertuo Next for my new system because I couldn't stand the constraints of the Pop any longer (I know the Next is supposedly less reliable but there was a 5-year warranty + €170 worth of capsules offered and that seemed like a good deal to me).

I noticed a noticeable difference in the volume of coffee delivered and the amount of froth. The Pop tended to give more coffee than was marked on the capsule (generally between 250 and 260 ml/8.5 to 8.6 oz for a mug) and to produce much more froth than the Next, which gives a quantity of coffee closer to that advertised and a froth that resorbs quickly.

I'm not complaining, even though I liked the texture provided by the Pop's foam, because I find that the coffee seems more fairly extracted on the Next and also because I can use normal-sized mugs. But I was curious to know if such a difference was normal? I've never noticed such glaring differences between Original Line machines. ",1,1730497297.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False

Emily falls as her chair tips over backward. The blood coming from her forehead looks like a fountain. Sean and Hank both duck under the table. Being the closest to the Idiot taking out his anger on the unknowing possession of my phone(s), without even thinking about it, I was diving over the table to get as far away from him as fast as I could.

""Do either you guys have a gun?"" I asked in less than a second.

""No,"" Hank and Sean reply.

""Shit!""

""What's wrong with this guy,"" Hank asked.

""He's pissed at what's on his phone text.""

""Did you... his girlfriend?"" Asked Sean.

""No, it’s my phone doing it.""

""What?"" They both ask.

""My phone(s) are possessed.""
 
They look at me like I am crazy, and to our shock, our table lifts and is tossed across the cafe. The Idiot's Muscle disposed of our only source of protection. We are left there in the open as he points his pistol at me.

The sound of a shotgun is heard as the clicking as its shell enters its chamber.

""Drop the gun, Mother..."" said the Coffee House Manager as he was standing behind the counter.

The Idiot takes his gun and extends it closer to me as his only future endeavor is to pull the trigger. I squint my eyes, but as he pulls the trigger, I hear a loud boom and watch the cups fly off the counter—and in a split second—the Idiot is forced across the cafe floor by the shell from the shotgun. I watch as he shatters the glass, flying through the window. Thank goodness the Coffee House Manager was quicker on the trigger.

It has been almost a month since the Coffee House incident. News agencies have harassed me—that want to interview me, book companies—that want me to write a book, and movie studios—that want to buy my story so they can make millions of dollars.

I have not talked to Sean or Hank since that night at the cafe. I am not sure, but I am almost positive that Sean told everyone about my phone(s) being possessed. I can't blame him. He needed the money worse than any of us.

I really miss Emily. She was a good friend. We talked to each other, by phone or in person, every day. I probably would have ended up marrying her—Who knows?

I was up all night reading the spam emails—the insults, threats, lies, and verbal assault—that had been sent through the emails but ended up in my spam mail. I checked to see if I had sent any of them. There they were—emails I had supposedly sent to others listed in my sent folder—clueless about who these people were.

It was Halloween morning. My emails were so flooded with spam, and I could do nothing. I thought it was over by getting rid of the smartphones. Apparently, I was wrong. The digital entity must have identified me by my WiFi numbers.

I heard a knock at my front door. I stopped what I was doing and went to the door and did not open it.

""Hello,"" I said.

The person on the other side of the door said, ""You don't know me, but this is life or death."" I saw blood running from under my door, and it touched my foot. I unlocked the door—

I feel really ashamed of it for the following reasons:

1. I'm already in a relationship with someone I'm considering marrying
2. Our age differences are significant (I'm the older one)
3. I've been struggling a lot with my self esteem and finding/keeping good friends without falling for them is hard for me.

I haven't confessed to them. Why would I other than to blow up my life and to hurt my current partner? I'm struggling a lot with feeling close to someone I'm sexually attracted to, trying (and failing) to keep my thoughts platonic.

My current partner is also friends with this coworker. Together, they have a lot of similar interests and get along with them very well.

I consider them one of my closest friends and if there wasn't the added wall of casual bro-ness (and the other factors above) I'd definitely would have dated them. Every time they do something nice or make a somewhat flirty comment I fall so hard.

I'm very scared I'm being way too obvious in liking them (such as getting them coffees, talking through their problems with them, messaging them back too quickly when they message me), and I don't know how to deal with my feelings other than suppressing them. It's so difficult when I look at them and notice things about them--the way their hair falls, the color of their eyes, their lips, their butt, the way their clothes hang off them. I almost went ballistic seeing them wearing a particular jacket and I was horrified at myself.

So I met up with a man I had been talking to for about 6 days on tinder, he was very very keen to meet and I was worried that I would be a disappointment in person. We had had the conversation that we were both a bit worried the other person wouldn't like us as much as we liked them.

We met for coffee, and then had that awkward bit where you can continue or one person can leave. We decided to continue and went to several other places (where either of us could have then cut it short without it being awkward.) After a few hours he needed to leave, as we left he went for a hug (I think, I'm now doubting myself), and I said he smelled nice, he said I smelt nice too, I asked if he wanted to meet up again and he said yes but hesitantly, he then asked me and I said yes. We then kissed, I thought he initiated it but I messaged him when I got home (which he said to do) and he has not replied at all.

I'm sad about being ghosted, as I think it's unkind paticularly after discussing our worries about it before hand but my main worry now is that I made him uncomfortable by kissing him when he clearly is not interested in a second meeting, so I must have misread things. I know that you shouldn't message after being ghosted, and I don't think I can take hearing why incase it's related to my looks in person, but I've been in the position where I've felt pressured to kiss someone and I feel awful I might have done that to him. I do want to apologise but I don't want it to seem like I'm self pitying after a message back or to make him feel worse.

There's a lady who I know from town generally who pops into the health food shop I work in occasionally and she came in asking for help with what sounded like a kidney infection or UTI because she knew I know herbs but was in a really tight budget and I was honest and said I think that's beyond my skill level and she should maybe check in with her GP and she indicated she had a bad relationship with taking medication. 

About a week later she was in again clearly in a lot of distress talking in a way that was quite concerning. A few days later I saw her again in town and she looked like she was hearing voices because she was talking a lot to someone clearly only she could hear. She was very distressed. 

I worked a lot with people with schizophrenia in a previous job. They're rarely a danger to other people and are more likely to be vulnerable. I'm not saying I know she has schizophrenia, but I know a little bit and I know that treating people like they don't exist isn't helpful and she was clearly very upset. 

I had a quick chat with her and just checked in in a friendly way (oh hey! How are you doing? You seemed quite distressed the other day) and offered a bit of listening and empathy and offered to buy her a coffee because I had one and it was cold and, you know, small town, tight community etc. She mentioned things going on at home and maybe she needed to see a doctor and I said that was probably a good idea if she was worried and we went out separate ways. This was about a week and a half ago. 

I just ran into her at the supermarket and she stopped me and pulled a book out of her backpack. It was a book on propagation with ""Thank you (my name) for helping me during my health crisis"" written in and I did *so little* but so many people clearly did less but anyway, that's why I cried a in the supermarket today. 

I feel like a thunderstorm. I have never had this much energy and I have never felt like I'm on the right path quite as much as I do not. 

So, druids, witches and druids trying to ignore the drumbeat of community witchcraft that's clearly looming on the horizon... I felt pretty fucking witchy today.

Working alone. ,"I work for a small low-volume cafe inside of a corporate banking building downtown. I make $13/hr + tips, so roughly $17-18 an hour total.

Pros:
3 out of 4 shifts/week are with my (only) coworker. We’re together from open to close and the owner doesn’t mind if we spend that time watching things on a laptop, reading, etc. due to how slow it is. 

Cons:
On the day my other coworker isn’t available, I work completely alone from open to close (8 hour shift). Originally I had another coworker I worked with on this day, they’re gone and my boss hasn’t hired anyone else. On that day I genuinely feel like I’m losing my mind, I can’t take a break because I’m alone and even though it’s slow I can’t relax. I’m a woman and feel uncomfortable with certain customer interactions as I am in a vulnerable position being alone. For example, yesterday a homeless man stole things in front of me and hit on me and sat in the cafe for hours, I was too afraid to be blunt or ask him to leave since I was the only one there and he was clearly schizophrenic or something. I also am frustrated that I’m doing essentially a 2-person job alone on this day. 

At the end of these solo shift days I feel incredibly exhausted and burnt out and I often cry during the shift. I think my pay is roughly average for my area (Charlotte, North Carolina) and I can’t decide if working in a higher-volume coffee shop is the better option, I know I’d have to be on my feet more etc. but presumably I’d be less stressed in other ways because I wouldn’t be going lowkey insane on the alone shift day. Side note I don’t get paid more or see any benefits from being alone, tips are pooled so I’m not keeping all of my tips from that day and I only get paid $1 more than my coworker.

First of all, I want to start by saying that I am NOT a doctor or any type of health professional. What I am sharing today is just how I managed to reverse my NAFLD, and in no way am I encouraging anyone to do what I did. With that out of the way, let’s get started:

1. I cut out all alcohol and foods high in saturated and trans fats, trying to avoid them as much as possible. Additionally, I also cut out anything with high amounts of added sugars. I was also overweight, so in addition to cutting these foods out, I ate at a caloric deficit to lose weight and body fat. To calculate how many calories you need to eat daily to lose weight, you can use this website: [Calorie Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html). Pair this with a calorie-counting app to keep yourself on track and ensure you don’t exceed your calories. I use [MyNetDiary](https://www.mynetdiary.com/) because it lets me scan food barcodes for free, but any calorie-counting app will suffice. Make sure to set the calorie goal within the app around the same as whatever the calorie calculator suggested, as I found that MyNetDiary overcalculated my daily calories, although other apps I've used in the past have been more accurate.
2. I started going to the gym daily, Monday through Friday, only taking weekends off. I used a split where I’d work on different muscle groups to avoid overworking my body. For those who might not know where to start, here’s the split I began with (it's not perfect nor the best, but it works, and I still use it today with some modifications). I would advise putting in moderate effort so that it feels challenging, but not so difficult that it affects your form when lifting or causes bodily harm/injuries. NOTE: I am also NOT a fitness professional, if you follow these exercises you're doing so at your own risk and I assume no responsibility. Please make sure you look up these exercises and practice proper form, as that alone will go a long way in your gym journey:

3. After every workout, I did at least 15 minutes of steady incline cardio (15% Incline, 3MPH but you might need to start lower). Make sure to do this AFTER every workout (not before, although you can do 5 minutes of cardio before each workout session if you’d like to warm up). Once 15 minutes becomes easy, you can increase the time. At one point, I was really motivated and was doing up to an hour of cardio, but I've reduced it to 20 minutes now due to time constraints and reaching my weight goals and reversing NAFLD (hopefully forever). This was my preferred form of steady cardio, but you can look into alternatives that suit you better. Like weightlifting, make sure it is challenging but sustainable.
4. Expanding on my diet, as you can see from above, I took the gym seriously. Therefore, whatever you do eat needs to have a healthy balance of fats, carbs, and protein. You should research your daily fat and carb needs, as I won't get into that here. For protein, you should consume at least 0.8 grams for every pound (lb.) of body weight (Or 1.8 grams per kg.). However, if you’re overweight and heavier than 220 lbs., I think you’ll be fine consuming no more than 175 grams of protein, as the number becomes excessively large beyond this weight. The purpose of consuming this much protein is to prevent muscle loss as much as possible while you're losing fat. Hopefully, the consumption of this much protein combined with weightlifting will actually help you gain muscle instead of losing it. For sweet cravings, I consumed fruits high in fiber with no added sugars, and occasionally had a diet soda. One diet soda every 1-2 weeks did no harm to me, but I know there's a lot of people that are against zero calorie sweeteners, so again, do your own research. Most of my calories came from greens (salads/vegetables) and skinless chicken (chicken breast, etc.). I did not follow any specific diets like keto but ate a diet closer to the Mediterranean while considering everything I mentioned above. Doing this, I still managed to keep my body in a state of ketosis.
5. I started taking a daily serving of Creatine Monohydrate (For weightlifting/gym. Make sure it’s creatine monohydrate, any other form of creatine makes little to no difference for the gym and may be more expensive.), Whey Protein (To help reach my daily protein goals; If you meet your protein goals without this, you don’t need to take it), Vitamin C, D3, and E. I recommend researching these supplements and consulting with a doctor before using them. I am simply sharing what I took because I want to disclose everything about the lifestyle I adopted to reverse this condition. I am NOT saying that any of these supplements helped me reverse NAFLD. Additionally, I added caffeine/coffee to my diet, consuming about 4 cups a day.

I believe that’s all the information. If I remember anything else, I’ll edit the post and add it. If you have any questions, please let me know. And once again, I am NOT a doctor. Thank you!",1,1730495860.0,FattyLiverNAFLD,0,0.67,False

Ok, so i got re-diagnosed with ADHD about 2 months ago. I got diagnosed about 7 years ago, and was put on Vyvanse 30mg. It was like a miracle pill. I was so upbeat, productive, and just way different. I was only on it for a month because i had to change doctors due to an indurance issue. My new dr would not continue the RX because of my history of alcoholism. 

Fast forward to now, finally got so fed up with being useless that i paid to go to a psychiatrist. He gave me a long test and confirmed an ADHD diagnosis. He prescribed 30mg Vyvanse. I was excited that i could start to put my life back together and it was going to ne the same experience i had 7 years ago. 

30mg essentially did nothing. A bit of apetite supression, but i honestly could hardly tell i took it. Got upped to 50mg, and its a bit different. I feel the physical effects of a stimulant like elevated heart rate, slightly warmer, apetite supression, ect... but i get zero cognitive benefits. No good mood, no increase in motivation or executive function, no elevated focus, nothing. I just feel like i took a pre-workout or drank one too many cups of coffee. 

My gut tells me that even when artificially stimulated, my brain is incapable of making enough dopamine to get the desired effect of the meds. I think my brain is broken. 

Has anyone had a similar experience with meds, and/or any idea what may be going on here? I'm really disheartened by this, because i had high hopes of making changes. It doesn't even feel like the same drug i took years ago.

But fear not! Here are some sassy self-care tips to keep your sanity intact (or at least somewhat functional):

	1.	Bubble Baths: Fill the tub, throw in some bath bombs, and pretend you’re a luxurious mermaid. Just don’t forget to actually bathe. Fish don’t use soap!
	2.	Social Media Detox: Log off for a day. Your friends will miss you, but your mental health will throw a party. Bonus: you’ll finally see what your plants look like in daylight.
	3.	Journaling: Write down your thoughts—preferably while sipping overpriced coffee. Let’s be real; if you can’t read it later, it’s basically a diary of your dramatic twists and turns.
	4.	Dance Like Nobody’s Watching: Because let’s face it, they’re all busy scrolling through TikTok. So blast that guilty pleasure playlist and show those kitchen utensils your best moves!
	5.	Treat Yo’ Self: Ice cream, pizza, or that ridiculously overpriced skincare product? Yes, please! Just remember, it’s all about balance—like eating a salad with your fries.
	6.	Meditation: Sit in silence, breathe, and try to silence your inner critic. It’s harder than it sounds, but if you can manage it, you might just ascend to a higher plane of existence—or at least get a solid five minutes without existential dread.
	7.	Hang Out with Pets: If you don’t have one, borrow a friend’s. Dogs and cats are great for snuggles and also for judging you silently when you wear pajamas all day.
	8.	Watch Trashy Reality TV: There’s nothing like watching other people’s drama to make your life seem like a masterpiece. Plus, you can yell at the screen—it’s basically therapy!

Remember, self-care isn’t selfish; it’s essential. So go forth and treat yourself, because if you don’t, who will? Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a bubble bath to attend to. 💁‍♀️

Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I had worked for Starbucks for about 2.5 years. I decided I was done and wanted to try working at a mom and pop cafe. I ended up applying on indeed to this new coffee shop a couple towns over and got a quick response. I was so excited because they had been open less than a year and I wanted to be part of their growth by being one of their baristas, and I wanted to learn more! Especially because I know that Starbucks doesn’t do anything the ‘ correct way’. 

I went to the interview and met the owner. She was super super sweet and inviting. We had a great conversation and she ended up telling me that she really really liked me and would love to have me give it a whirl. We discussed pay and we agreed that I would be getting $14, which meant I had to take a $1 pay cut since Starbucks paid me $15. But I was okay with that since I understood that they’ve only been open about ten months. 

She asks if I could shadow her husband who runs the shop and would be paid. ( mostly husband and wife run the shop Like 98% of the time. Only 2 other employees who work an average of ten hours a week) after one day of shadowing we established two more shifts in the following days and that was that. 

Well today was the third day. I came in took some orders, cleaned a couple things, prepared food and pastries and various other things. I was doing pretty good and I was feeling pretty good too. I got to learn a lot more about the craft and was actually taking things in. 

Well then suddenly the husband comes back in after a phone call( wife has an actual office job and has hurt her wrist so she’s not currently in the shop) and asks how long I worked at Starbucks. I said 2.5 years. He proceeded to tell me that he cannot pay me $14 because I have a lot to learn and he would’ve paid me $14 if I was more knowledgeable especially with milk foaming ( which he hasn’t let me try since I told him Starbucks machines are automatic and that’s all I knew). He then said that I’ll have to take a pay cut and that his wife would message me later on to let me know what the pay rate would be. He also said that he would raise my pay possibly to $14 once I mastered how to foam milk and get more aquatinted with every thing else. I didn’t know what to say at the time so I said it was fine and we could talk about it and that it was understandable. 

Well I came home and told my boyfriend about it and he says he’s mad for me. But I didn’t really take it that way because I tend to be very understanding and level headed. But my sister also said the same thing and said that it’s not okay that his wife told me $14 was okay and then gets changed suddenly a couple days later. 

My question to all you experienced folks, was this okay? Am I being taken advantage of? I tend to be a push over at times and I’m not sure if that’s why this happened or if this is normal.

1ghfp9q,https://i.redd.it/2ed2twrvscyd1.jpeg,Advice Needed: Maximizing Layout and Space in Our Small Living Room (12x12)!,"Hello!

My fiancé and I are moving into our first home together, but we’re running into some challenges with setting up our living room space. The room is on the smaller side (12ft x 12ft), and the windows make it a bit tricky to figure out the best layout.

We’d love to fit in a few essentials: a sofa (we’re considering a sectional, but we’re open to other options), a coffee table, a TV stand, and, of course, the TV. We want to make the space as functional and comfortable as possible, but we’re also hoping to make it feel a bit more spacious.

Any layout advice or tips for making a small room look bigger would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!",1,1730494595.0,interiordecorating,1,1.0,False
1ghfp6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1ghfp6q/nj_missing_wages/,"[NJ] ""Missing"" wages","Hi, there! I'm a workers' comp adjuster. I'm trying to ensure I have accurate wage information for an injured employee so that I can determine his TTD rate correctly, and I don't know exactly how to go about this because it honestly seems more like an HR issue than WC.

I have a claim for a seasonal NJ employee (let's use a fake name and call him ""Al""). When I received Al's wage statement from his employer this morning, I spat out coffee because he had four weeks of gross wages under $100.00 (which is about six hours, at most, per week at NJ minimum wage). His other two weeks were about 30 hours and 47 hours, so that was at least normal.

According to Al, there were issues with management throughout the month of August 2024. This allegedly resulted in Joe being called in for work but not being clocked in by the store manager, thereby working basically unpaid. He stated he was working closer to thirty hours for those August weeks.

Is there anything Al can do to prove he worked the hours that he told me he allegedly worked?

(I've asked Al if he has any emails to HR about the missing hours; he said he would check but has yet to get back to me. You'd think you'd remember if you did or did not, but I also can't remember what I had for breakfast today, so I have no right to judge there.)",1,1730494590.0,AskHR,0,1.0,False

Hey everyone!

Hope everyone’s doing well. I’m just here bored at work lol.

I’m just looking for more friends that like to write/rp and draw! I’m honestly very open-minded with subject matters. I used to be the kind of artist that did a lot of self-inserts back in the day, and I even wrote fanfiction xD

I play a lot of single player games and FFXIV on my pc. I have a ps5 and am slowly going through FF7Rebirth. I get distracted a lot.

TV shows… let’s see. I watch a bit of anime; so stuff like Elusive Samurai, that one anime with crow people that has a name I can never remember. I also read manga too. Finally getting into Vagabond and Vinland Saga. Berserk and Witch Hat Atelier are my absolute favs.  
I’m watching ‘Dark Winds’ with my partner, and I usually end up just watching the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice as a comfort show. LoTR is my comfort movie as far as trilogy’s go. I’m a little picky with actual tv shows though and am totally fine with foreign ones too. Jordskott was a favorite of mine to watch!

I don’t read as often as I’d like sadly, kinda dropped the ball with it.

Anyways! Besides all that I like hot Cheeto fries and coffee (not together that sounds terrible for both ends lol). Botanical gardens, museums, observatories, the zoo or the aquarium, anything where I can be outside and just learn about stuff and see nature is always a good thing for me. Also coffee shops, I am not a coffee expert,  but I love the smell of it! Also with some pan dulce or something is good.

I’m a Latina and non-binary. Fashion style is kind of goth/alt and always sleepy lol. I speak Spanish and I’m looking to get back into practicing that and maybe Japanese or Swedish again.

Fun fact: I’ve been to Sweden a couple of times

I’m looking for friends closer in age that like joking around and can also be mature at times. I’m burnt out from being the therapy friend all the time so I just want people I can be a dork with and relax a little.

Also if you looove monster romances! Can we be friends?! lol",2,1730493914.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

One thing that would make the game more immersive is if many taps/sinks/water coolers/showers provided water. Being dehydrated when standing next to what would be a water source in real life seems odd, and Fallout 4 had water sources before survival mode was introduced.  Even toilets could provide water if wanting the FO4 experience (maybe with a high chance of disease).

I did find a mod that adds usable water coolers as a decor item with an indication that it might be extended to all water coolers in game later, though that doesn't seem to have gone ahead. The mod does similar for coffe machines, which I hadn't thought about, but is also a great idea (I definitely tried interacting with coffee machines when I first came across them in my first playthrough, to be disappointed they were just decorative).

How hard would it be to create a mod that adds these water sources? I'm happy to create it if it is something I could pick up and do myself. If it requires more in depth modding experience, would anyone else be willing to create a mod that does this?


*I have not enjoyed survival mode in previous Bethesda games, and I think it is because of the 2% xp boost providing a payoff. Also I am assuming survival being linked to xp is base game, but it may be from mods installed. I am going to look into whether I can change time to 1:1 to and make food and drink required every 6-10 hours, but that is for later.",3,1730493883.0,Starfield,0,0.81,False

Normal machine pressure (15bar?)
Stock portafilter and basket. (Classical basket)
Tried varying coffee weight 16-18g due to basket size more suited to lower coffee amounts. While weighing out 2:1 of water
Freshly ground good coffee (makes a delicious aeropress push). Using a fellow opus grinder no.2 setting.
I have tried varying grind size a few ticks up and down , still cant find a consistent sweet spot.

Tamping: i have a twistable distributior and havent been tamping, use distributor only, and have tried varying depth to ensure the puck gets some pressure on it.

I've had the machine a week, so have been getting used to it, my first proper espresso machine. But still, i was getting better coffee from an entry level bean to cup machine in my previous setup. Its starting to frustrate me, lots of sour shots.

I have been targetting 28second shots so adjusting grind size to achieve this, but still got a sour shot after my most recent 17g /34g pulled in 30 s. This was disappointing, as the other variables seemed to stack up to make it a delicious cup.

My plans going forward are:

- Mod the 9 bar spring. Need to order from china, so i will have to find a solution for my 15 bar coffee in the meantime!
- update portafilter basket (not heard great reviews for stock one).

Before i do these id love to get a good (not fantastic ) coffee from a relatively expensive machine. 

Any tips much appreciated 👍

","I embarked on a caffeine-fueled adventure with the much-hyped Java Burn, a coffee supplement promising not just a morning pick-me-up but also a metabolism boost. As an avid coffee enthusiast, I was intrigued to explore whether this product lived up to its bold claims.

# [✅Click Here To Visit — “OFFICIAL WEBSITE”✅](https://tinyurl.com/nhbbez7d)

First Impressions:

I used the Java Burn supplement for a month, incorporating it into my daily routine alongside my regular coffee intake. The packaging exuded a sense of sophistication, with a sleek design and promises of increased energy and fat-burning benefits. The instructions were clear, recommending one sachet per day, preferably in the morning.

Flavor and Preparation:

Upon tearing open the sachet, I was greeted by a pleasant aroma reminiscent of freshly ground coffee beans. Java Burn blended seamlessly with my usual coffee, imparting a mild, nutty undertone without overpowering the rich coffee flavor. The convenience of a pre-measured sachet made preparation a breeze, making it a practical addition to my busy mornings.

Energy Boost:

One of the standout features of Java Burn was its promised energy boost. I noticed a gradual increase in alertness and sustained energy throughout the day. Unlike the jittery feeling associated with some caffeine supplements, Java Burn provided a smoother and more prolonged energy release, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a steady pick-me-up.

Metabolism and Weight Management:

The primary claim of Java Burn revolves around its ability to enhance metabolism and aid in weight management. While I cannot attribute all my weight-related changes solely to this supplement, I did observe a subtle decrease in my overall appetite. Combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise, Java Burn seemed to contribute positively to my weight management efforts.

Ingredients and Transparency:

Examining the ingredient list revealed a blend of familiar components such as green tea extract, green coffee bean extract, and various antioxidants. Java Burn prides itself on its natural and plant-based composition, appealing to those conscious of their dietary choices. The transparency in listing the ingredients added a layer of trust to the overall product experience.

Taste Preferences and Customization:

Java Burn acknowledges that taste preferences vary, and they encourage users to experiment with different beverage choices for customization. I appreciated this approach, as it allowed me to tailor the supplement to suit my personal taste preferences. Whether mixed with black coffee or a smoothie, Java Burn seamlessly integrated into my daily routine.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a noteworthy addition to my coffee regimen, offering a harmonious blend of taste and functionality. While it may not be a miraculous solution for weight management, the subtle energy boost and metabolism support make it a viable choice for those seeking a holistic approach to their well-being. As with any supplement, individual experiences may vary, but Java Burn certainly left me with a positive impression and a newfound appreciation for the fusion of health and coffee culture.",0,1730493233.0,Blexit,0,0.5,False

We are renting in the DC metro area (VA side). Combined income $260k, our preferred budget is in the $800-900k range, could go higher.

We'd like to buy a house over 2000 sq ft with a yard in a city that's pedestrian/runner friendly (meaning: sidewalks, parks or paved trails, acceptable running weather). We also like to get around by bike when it's convenient (e.g. bike 1-2 miles to a coffee shop or restaurant), but we have a car too. I want to stress that we don't need the whole city to be walkable (walkability being a very common request in this sub!) just a few shops/restaurants in a 5-10 min walk would be superb.

We are early 30's, no kids yet but probably in a few years, working remotely in life sciences/data science/stats. I'd like to be hybrid and my type of role is often at universities/local govt public health departments. Other wants are: an airport within an hour, not super sticky humidity and not Denver-dry, light snow if any (just not MN-type snow), no hurricane areas, blue state. We generally like medium-sized cities (say 300k-1mil popn). I'm a longtime vegetarian and I love having more than 1 option on the menu; plenty of places here don't have any v options but I think a lot of cities will have more.

I'm from out west and all of my family is scattered out west, but we aren't very close. My husband is from the east coast, and his very close family is scattered along the east coast, but a few family members are out west. His family would visit no matter where we end up (mine wouldn't even if we lived in the same state lol but not really lol) - that's part of why an airport is so important to us.

We're considering Boston and I've never been there, Portland, OR, which I briefly lived south of during my childhood, possibly Sacramento or other northern CA and just about any random place we hear about. I don't feel at home in the south and we're barely in the south here in VA.

It should be at least an hour (assuming it’s not a trainwreck) but absolutely no more than two.

This is both necessary and sufficient for determining whether or not you have an interest in seeing the person again and whether they are sufficiently attractive.

Activities such as a movie or apple/pumpkin picking or w/e are fine for a second date, but the first should just essentially be a conversation because if you go onto a relationship communication will be the most important part of maintaining it.

The date should end with at least a “nice to have met you” and, if you thought it went well, tentative plans to meet again either at the conclusion of the date or via text on the same day—any later is a 🚩 that indicates the other is not really interested, which is not necessarily a deal-breaker, especially if you’re also on the fence, but it means temper expectations if you’re initially really into them.

Either a hug or a departing kiss may be acceptable depending on the woman’s body language (i.e. if you’re the woman, be slightly flirtatious if you like the man. If you’re the man, be mindful of the cues you’re getting). Any offer for or expectation of greater physical intimacy is a 🚩 unless you yourself are trying to hook up (in which case it’s fine, but it means you’re not on a respectable date).

Similarly, it’s ideal for each party to pay for their respective drink, but it’s fine if the man offers to pay, so long as it’s not done with an expectation of of intimacy (which it shouldn’t have because it’s going to be between $5-$30 and if that if you consider that a significant amount of money it means you’re too poor to be dating and should be working more instead).

It is a major 🚩 if either party expects more than this, namely, dinner at a nice restaurant or even an evening full of planned activities. It is a 🚩 on the part of the women, because it’s a sign that she’s seeking a provide of resources rather than romantic partner. It is a 🚩 on the part of the man because it means he is either expecting sex in exchange for the dinner/activities or that he is just bad at setting boundaries—now this part does not apply if both parties are seeking a relationship that is fundamentally transactional and that sort of relationship can work but only between a quite dominant man and quite submissive woman.

(Note that this is not the only way to initiate a successful romantic relationship but it is the only respectable form of first date in the contemporary sense.)",8,1730492589.0,redscarepod,40,0.57,False

1ghex1s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ghex1s,1981: Mugabe assassinated and Zimbabwe invaded by apartheid South Africa. But Mugabe's guerrillas ovverrun the country ,"**1981: the Fall of Umtali: the defeat of South Africans and their Muzorewa's puppet Army in Zimbabwe**

...1981, article by John Doe, British correspondent from Harare, embedded with South African Army

**Latest events in Zimbabwe**

In 1981, Zimbabwe found itself in a period of great political and military instability. 
After Robert Mugabe's death in a terrorist attack in 1980, apartheid South Africa invaded the country, seeking to establish an allied government.
In 1981 the new government was installed in Zimbabwe with the black prime minister Abel Muzorewa.
But this led to a conflict between the South African and government forces of Muzorewa and the black guerrillas of the ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army), loyal to Mugabe's successors.
ZANLA has regained control of the east of the country, thanks to a ferocious guerrilla war aided by China and Mozambique.
ZANLA carried out mass executions of black and white civilians accused of supporting the Muzorewa government and South Africans.
ZANLA besieged the city of Umtali, the last stronghold of forces loyal to Muzorewa and the Pretoria government.
I witnessed this terrible battle and was an involuntary participant.

**The Battle of Umtali: Battle Progress**

The defense forces consisted of a garrison of Zimbabwean soldiers, made up of white Rhodesian and indigenous militias loyal to the government of Abel Muzorewa. 
The garrison had heavy armament and limited but crucial support from the South African air force, which parachuted supplies and men.

On the other hand, ZANLA forces were composed of infantry and artillery units, which were numerically superior and enjoyed a high degree of motivation, fighting for control of the country.

Initially, ZANLA launched an initial assault with artillery bombardments, aiming to weaken the external defenses of the city, fortified by the garrison loyal to Muzorewa. Muzorewa's soldiers responded with defensive fire from trenches and fortified positions.

The South African air force intervened by parachuting supplies and White Rhodesian troops to support the besieged garrison. 
Rhodesian paratroopers reinforced the defensive lines, but continuous ZANLA artillery attacks created an increasingly critical situation.

As the siege progressed, the fighting became more intense and closer together. ZANLA infantry launched coordinated attacks on Rhodesian positions, using the cover of night to infiltrate enemy lines.
After weeks of siege, the Zimbabwean garrison's resources began to run low. ZANLA's incessant attacks and numerical superiority led to the wear and tear of the defenses, which began to buckle under the pressure.
Finally, the last defensive lines were overwhelmed. ZANLA troops entered the city, destroying the defenders. The battle ended with the capture of the city by communist guerrillas, marking a decisive victory for ZANLA.

I had arrived in Umtali when the siege was already advanced. Joining the defenders' garrison, I followed the last weeks of resistance and even had to fight to save my life.

** Night before the battle at Umtali: the racism of the Rhodesian officers **

I still remember the night before the day of the last battles in Umtali.
I was in the garrison bar, a squalid room in the command bunker converted into an improvised restaurant and bar for the officers.

The white Rhodesian and black officers of Muzorewa's army were drinking like sponges whatever alcohol came within reach.
It was the moment of confessions and last remorse before yet another battle the next day.

I started talking to Lieutenant James, a lieutenant in the white Rhodesian militia ""the Selous Lions"".
James had started talking about his childhood in the bush, on his large family farm.
Men, when they are close to death, always think back to childhood and the rosiest moments of their lives.
""My family has always lived here in Rhodesia. My great-grandfather was one of the first settlers, who arrived here in 1895 to take possession of this wild land. Here in Rhodesia there was nothing: there was only bush, animals wild, some huts with natives who lived like savages.
For years, my great-grandfather cleared and cultivated the lands around Umtali, breaking his back every day to work together with some indigenous people he had taken as servants and laborers. He cultivated his land and became wealthy growing coffee to export to Europe.
It was a risky life: he always had to go around with a gun slung over his shoulder, to defend himself from some lion wandering around in the bush or some native who might have bad intentions. My great-grandfather had tamed these wild lands, building a model farm, with a neoclassical house like in London and the most modern agricultural tools. He also had the natives who worked for him build a village, a church and an elementary school. He wanted the natives to study and become able to speak English and be good Christians, like the rest of us in England. He was also friends with the village chief and the priest, who kept the village members in line or reported to the police anyone who had strange seditious ideas or talked about rebelling against the whites.""
James continued: ""When my father became the owner of the company after the Second World War, I sent the native laborers away: to cultivate the land, a few modern tractors, fertilizers, more modern vehicles were now enough. With the war that began in 1966, my farm went down the drain and I lost my farm. The war between blacks and whites destroyed the economy and coexistence between the races.
I wasted years fighting in the Bush against the communist black terrorists.""
He then recalls the tragic days of 1980, after Mugabe's death: ""After Mugabe's death, my farm was attacked and destroyed by blacks who supported Mugabe... my parents and my wife were massacred in an atrocious way. .."" He bursts into tears at this point.
""I swore eternal vengeance against Mugabe and all his supporters.... When the South Africans invaded Zimbabwe, I immediately joined them and took revenge on these damned savages! I cornered and shot dozens of these cowards of the ZANLA! All natives are savages!""

James's scream comes from a drunken Black officer, who responds by insulting him back. A fight breaks out between the two, stopped by their companions who separate them.
The racial situation in the new state of Zimbabwe is still explosive and coexistence between whites and blacks is far from idyllic.
It does not appear that Prime Minister Muzorewa's messages of peaceful coexistence between blacks and whites have had a great effect in the country.

**The ""Lion"": a ZANLA commander in Umtali**

One of the most famous ZANLA commanders who is directing the siege of Umtali is nicknamed the ""Lion"".
He is a brave but ruthless military leader. South African intelligence claims he carried out numerous massacres of Zimbabwean civilians who were hostile to his group.

I came across an old article about him, published by a propaganda newspaper for white Rhodesians:

""SAVAGE LEADERSHIP: A GLIMPSE INTO ZANLA'S TERROR
*By Winston Blackwood III
*Salisbury, Rhodesia, 19 October 1975*

In what can only be described as a further descent into savagery, our forces continue to encounter the growing menace of one Tendai Moyo, a particularly troublesome rebel leader who has emerged from the untamed wilderness of our northern territories. This self-styled ""Lion,"" as his primitive followers call him, represents everything that validates our civilizing mission in this untamed land.

I had the misfortune of witnessing the aftermath of one of his raids on a peaceful white settlement last month. The precision of the attack only proves what we've long suspected: these terrorists are receiving foreign communist training, as no native could have engineered such coordination without outside assistance.

Moyo's background, pieced together from intelligence reports, reads like a cautionary tale of what happens when we extend too much charity to the native population. Educated at one of our mission schools - no doubt at considerable expense to the Crown - he repaid Christian kindness with betrayal, using his literacy to spread seditious ideas among his tribesmen. This is what comes of teaching Shakespeare to those who would be better served learning proper agricultural techniques.

The tribal markings on his face, which his followers romantically call battle scars, speak to his reversion to primitive ways. Sources indicate he maintains some sort of witch doctor's council, mixing communist propaganda with tribal superstitions to maintain control over his band of marauders. This dangerous combination of educated cunning and savage brutality makes him particularly threatening to the peace we have worked so hard to maintain.

His growing influence among the natives is troubling. Using a perversion of the education we so generously provided, he has established what he calls ""schools"" in the territories he controls - though one shudders to imagine what sort of instruction occurs in these bush classrooms. No doubt these are merely indoctrination centers where young minds are poisoned against the proper order of things.

The red headband he wears, which some romantic souls in the foreign press have tried to paint as some sort of noble warrior's mark, is nothing more than a communist signal flag, announcing his allegiance to those who would destroy civilization itself. That he combines this with traditional tribal elements only demonstrates the cunning way these terrorists manipulate native superstitions for their marxist ends.

Most disturbing are the reports of his treatment of loyal natives who refuse to support his cause. While his supporters speak of his ""justice,"" we have documented numerous cases of families being forced to provide food and shelter to his men, under threat of the most savage reprisals. This is the true face of what these revolutionaries call ""liberation.""

Our security forces continue their valiant efforts to restore order and protect civilization in these troubled territories. It is becoming increasingly clear that firmer measures may be necessary to contain this growing tribal insurgency before it threatens the very foundations of proper society in Rhodesia.

The longer we allow this ""Lion"" to roam our lands, the more we risk losing everything generations of dedicated colonials have built. Some may criticize our methods as harsh, but as any experienced hand in Africa knows, firmness is the only language the native truly understands.""

The Lion has a sinister reputation among the defenders of Umtali: he never takes prisoners and is animated by an implacable hatred towards whites.
After seeing the racist disposition of some white Rhodesian officers towards the natives, I am not surprised that there is this racial hatred in this land that has been soaked in blood.
Even if the whites are wiped out, the blood and memories of the war will remain to imbue Zimbabwe's land and minds for a long time to come.

**Battle in the trenches at Umtali**

The sun was rising over Umtali when we heard the first mortar shots. 
I was crouched in my position, clutching the rifle the soldiers had given me, while I watched the horizon turn red. 
It wasn't the dawn that colored the sky, but the smoke from the fires blazing in the city.

“They're coming,” whispered Kumba, the young black soldier at my side. His eyes betrayed the weariness of weeks of siege, but his voice remained steady.

The ZANLA artillery had begun its bombardment at dawn, as they always did.
But this time it was different. The intensity of the fire was greater, and we could hear the sound of hundreds of men moving in the distance. We all knew what that meant: the assault was about to begin.

The roar of South African Air Force Dakotas rang out above us. Planes flew low, parachuting precious supplies into our lines. 
An officer near us shouted: ""The ammunition is running out in the eastern sector.""

The bombing intensified. The explosions kicked up clouds of red dust that obscured vision. Through that curtain, we began to make out the silhouettes of the ZANLA infantry advancing en masse. There were hundreds, perhaps thousands, moving like a single, relentless human tide.

""Fire at will!"" The order crossed lines. Our machine guns began to fire, creating corridors of death between the enemy ranks. But for every guerrilla who fell, two more took his place. They advanced inexorably, regardless of their losses.

The next few hours were a hell of close combat.
The trenches turned into graves as ZANLA guerrillas poured into our positions. 
We fought meter by meter, bunker by bunker. The air was thick with dust and cordite, filled with the cries of the wounded and the incessant crackle of automatic weapons.

The world had been reduced to a few meters of muddy trench. The smoke from the explosives stung my eyes as I held my camera in one hand and my rifle in the other. I was no longer just an observer - the desperate situation had turned me into a fighter too.

""They're infiltrating from the east!"" Sergeant James' scream rent the air, followed immediately by the crackle of the Rhodesian FAL.
 I pressed myself against the wall of the trench as the first ZANLA shells exploded above us, raining earth and shrapnel.

Then I saw them: dark figures pouring into our positions like a black wave. The first guerrilla jumped into the trench less than ten meters from me, his AK-47 spewing fire. The black Kumba soldier to my right fell with a strangled cry. Instinctively, I pulled the trigger of the rifle in my hand. The recoil surprised me, but the guerrilla fell backwards.

There was no time to think. More were arriving. The fight turned into a wild melee, a chaos of bodies struggling in the mud of the trench. The air was thick with gunpowder and screams, the metallic smell of blood mixed with the acrid smell of cordite.

That's when I noticed it. A tall man, who stood out from the other guerrillas. He wore a dark green beret and had a red bandana on his forehead.  He had wounds on his face and was directing the attack with decisive gestures. His men followed him with fanatical devotion. He must have been one of the ZANLA commanders.

Time seemed to slow down. Through the scope of the rifle, I could clearly see his face marked by a scar running across his left cheek. Our eyes met for an instant. Fierce determination shone in his eyes.

I pulled the trigger twice in quick succession. The ZANLA commander staggered backwards, his green beret flying. For a moment he remained standing, amazement painted on his face. Then he collapsed into the trench.

The effect on his men was immediate. The attack lost coordination, turning into a series of disorganized assaults which the Rhodesians repelled with relative ease. But we all knew it was just a breather. Other commanders would take his place, other men would come.

Later, when the battle moved to another sector, I found myself staring at the body of the ZANLA commander. 
Death had made him immobile and rigid, with glassy eyes. 
His uniform was dusty and bloodstained, but I could see the decorations on his chest: he had fought in many battles before this one.
I recognized his face: it was the ""Lion"", the famous and ruthless guerrilla leader.

I bent down and picked up his green beret, an impulse I couldn't explain. Perhaps I wanted a tangible reminder of that moment when I had gone from being an observer to becoming an active participant in this merciless war. 
Or perhaps it was a reminder of how the line between observer and fighter could become so thin in moments of desperation.

Sergeant James put his hand on my shoulder. “First time shooting someone?” he asked in a surprisingly gentle voice.

I nodded, unable to speak.

“It never gets easier,” he said. ""And it shouldn't."" Then he turned to organize the defenses, leaving me alone with my thoughts and the weight of the rifle, which suddenly felt much heavier in my hand.

In my notebook, later, I wrote only a few lines about that meeting. Some experiences are too intense, too personal to be fully captured by words. But I kept the green beret, hidden in the bottom of my backpack: a silent witness to the day when a journalist became, out of necessity, a soldier.

I saw Lieutenant James, our company commander, standing on a pile of rubble, shouting orders, trying to coordinate the defense. 
A moment later, a barrage of bullets hit him in the chest. He fell without a sound, as the defense lines began to crumble.

By sunset, it was clear that the battle was lost. Our ammunition was almost exhausted, and the ZANLA guerrillas had now penetrated most of our positions. The retreat order came like a whisper along the broken lines.

I retreated with the last survivors, crossing the once familiar streets of Umtali, now reduced to a lunar landscape of craters and rubble. The crackle of gunfire had turned into a distant echo, replaced by an eerie silence broken only by the crackle of fires.

As night fell on Umtali, I turned towards the city one last time. The flames lit up the night sky, silent witnesses of that terrible battle.

**The Last Dawn of Umtali**
The perimeter had shrunk to a few blocks in the center of Umtali. 
We were surrounded, exhausted, low on ammunition. The field hospital had been set up in the basement of what had once been a luxury hotel. The stench of blood and disinfectant mixed with the acrid smell of gunpowder.

I saw Major Henderson enter the hospital with a group of officers, their faces as gray as ash. 
I knew what they were going to do. I heard the shots, dry and methodical, followed by an even more terrible silence. They were giving the seriously injured the only mercy possible: a quick death, before ZANLA found them.

The situation was becoming desperate. I had never seen such terror in the eyes of human beings.
The native civilians had massed behind our lines at dawn, hundreds of them, carrying only what they could carry. 
They were all family members of the black soldiers in the garrison, all terrified by the stories of what ZANLA did to the collaborators.
Elderly people shuffling around with improvised sticks, mothers clutching newborns to their chests, children with eyes too old for their age.
“They'll kill us all,” an older woman in Shona kept repeating, clutching at my sleeve. ""ZANLA does not forgive collaborators.""

I was helping the old woman to reach a safer refuge when I heard the characteristic whistle of the incoming mortar. It's strange how the brain processes these moments. The sound has an almost musical quality, a rising hiss that tells you exactly how much time you have to react.

""Down!"" I screamed, pushing the woman towards a depression in the ground. It was at that moment that I heard the shot. It wasn't so much pain as an incredible feeling of pressure on my left side, as if someone had hit me with a hot hammer.

The world turned upside down. I found myself lying on my back, staring at an eerily blue sky. The sound of battle suddenly seemed distant, replaced by a persistent ringing in his ears. I remember thinking how absurd it was that the clouds continued to move peacefully above us, indifferent to the chaos below.

It wasn't until I tried to move that the pain really came. 
A blaze of pure agony that made me give a strangled cry. I instinctively brought my hand to my side and drew it back, wet with blood. The mortar shrapnel had torn through my uniform and the flesh beneath, leaving a ragged hole that pulsed with my heart.

""Don't move, sir,"" said a voice. A young black medic had appeared at my side, his hands already busy pulling out a field bandage. His face was so young under the dirty helmet, he couldn't have been more than nineteen. ""It's a bad wound, but it doesn't appear to have hit anything vital.""

I tried to focus on his face as he worked, ignoring the pain that increased with each breath. The adrenaline was wearing off, giving way to an increasingly acute awareness of the damage to my body. It was a strangely intimate sensation, as if I could feel every fiber of torn tissue.

The elderly woman I had tried to protect was still there, miraculously unharmed. 
He knelt beside me, mumbling prayers in Shona as the doctor continued to bandage me. 
The pain throbbed like a living being in my side, but strangely I felt detached from everything, as if I was observing the scene from afar.

My notebook had fallen a few feet away, the pages stained with my own blood. At that moment, I remember thinking how appropriate it was: I was literally writing this story with my own blood.

""We have to move it,"" I heard someone say. “ZANLA is going to smash this sector.”

As they lifted me up, the pain exploded again, so intense it made me see stars. But it was a pain that kept me grounded in reality, that reminded me that I was still alive. In the distance, I could hear the ever-closer noise of battle, the crackle of automatic weapons mingling with the cries of the wounded and shouted orders.

“Your camera equipment, sir,” a soldier said, picking up my fallen camera. The strap had been cleanly severed by the same shrapnel that had injured me.

""You hold it,"" I managed to say through clenched teeth. ""I won't need it anymore.""

It was the last thing I said before the pain took over. The world began to blur at the edges, the sounds of battle growing more distant. The last thing I remember was the older woman's face, her lips moving in silent prayer as they carried me away from the front.

**Evacuation of the last wounded from Umtali** 

The sound of a helicopter's blades rent the air. A Rhodesian Air Force helicopter was descending into what remained of the central square, under heavy fire from ZANLA artillery. 
""The wounded! Charge the wounded!"" someone shouted.

I pushed myself towards the helicopter, helped by a soldier.
The scene around us was apocalyptic. Desperate civilians ran towards the aircraft, looking for an escape route. The helicopter crew tried to keep them away - there was only room for the most seriously injured, like me.

""Hold on tight!"" the pilot shouted as we lifted off. Below us, desperation turned to panic. Some civilians tried to cling to the helicopter's wings and skids. I saw black civilians fall one by one, smaller and smaller figures disappearing into the chaos below. A woman was still clutching her baby as she fell. I closed my eyes, but that image remained imprinted in my mind.

When I reopened them, we were gaining altitude. The battle beneath us unfolded like a map of hell. ZANLA was converging on the city center from all directions. The last Rhodesian positions were small islands in a sea of ​​chaos.

That's when it happened. A series of explosions ripped through the center of Umtali. The last defenders had blown up the ammunition and fuel depots. They wouldn't give up. 
Flames reached up into the sky like accusing fingers, while columns of black smoke blotted out the sun.

Through gaps in the smoke, I could see ZANLA troops pouring into the streets. Their cries of victory rose up to us, carried by the wind along with the smell of burning. Green ZANLA flags were hoisted over the burning buildings.

""It's over,"" murmured the wounded soldier next to me. ""Umtali has fallen.""

From my notebook I took out the green beret of the ""Lion"", the ZANLA commander I had killed in the trenches. 
I let it fall into the void, a small dark dot that disappeared into the smoke of the dying city.

The helicopter turned south, taking us away from what was now enemy territory. The moans of the wounded mixed with the noise of the rotors. Some were crying, others stared into space with glassy eyes. A young soldier kept mumbling prayers in Afrikaans.

I took my notebook and began to write, even as the blood from my wound stained the pages. Someone had to tell what had happened to Umtali. Someone had to bear witness to the sacrifice of those men who had chosen to die rather than surrender.

As the city disappeared into the horizon, I thought of all those we had left behind. To the wounded in the hospital. To the civilians who were unable to escape. To the soldiers who had blown up their positions. 

The last words I wrote that day were simple: “Umtali died today, but her ghost will forever haunt those who survived to tell her story.”

**Last South African revenge**
Our helicopter was flying over the savannah, returning to base.
The dull roar of the helicopter rang across the afternoon sky, its blades cutting through the air with deadly precision. 
I was on the helicopter as if injured and I was watching what was happening as if it were a nightmare. The fever was burning and my heart was racing.

The helicopter pilot and the machine gunners looked through the glass of the cabin at the straw village that stretched out beneath the helicopter, as small and fragile as a model. 
The huts, carefully built by the natives, looked like scattered dots in a green sea of ​​vegetation.

The South African military command had ordered the South African air force to bomb every village that might host ZANLA guerrillas.
We were near Umtali, conquered by ZANLA and that village full of civilians was in a rebel area.
The pilot smiled demonically and ordered the machine gunners to open fire towards the village.
The pilot pressed the button to launch the helicopter's missiles. 
The missiles streaked downward, trailing incandescent trails. The explosion was instantaneous and a fireball that engulfed the thatched structures, turning them into a blazing inferno. The flames rose high, dancing with destructive fury.

From above, I saw the natives fleeing in all directions, tiny figures running desperately for their lives. They looked like ants in a disturbed anthill, movements chaotic and disorganized. 
The machine gunners began firing their machine guns at those small shapes running on the ground.
Many of them fell to the ground, coming to rest in the red prairie dust.
My heart was beating wildly; the sight of the village in flames and the natives fleeing from the machine guns would have remained imprinted in my mind.

1ghew8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SirBigdog01/comments/1ghew8z/story_mirrors_of_fate_chapter_3/,Story: Mirrors of Fate - Chapter 3,"Jason woke in the early hours of the morning, his heart racing, his skin damp with sweat as the last remnants of a dream slipped through his fingers. He lay frozen, staring up at the dark ceiling, as he tried to capture the scattered fragments still lingering in his mind. The images were vivid yet disjointed—a landscape that was both familiar and foreign, a place where every detail felt slightly askew, as if viewed through the haze of a memory he couldn't fully recall. He could still feel the damp air pressing against his skin, the whisper of leaves rustling in a wind that seemed to carry voices just out of reach.

He closed his eyes, trying to summon the details, but they darted away like shadows retreating from light. There had been a path, lined with towering trees that seemed to arch overhead, their branches weaving together like the ribs of some vast, ancient creature. He remembered a feeling of being pulled forward, like an invisible thread was leading him, tugging at him, urging him deeper into the heart of the forest. And somewhere, just beyond the trees, he felt something—or someone—waiting for him.

But as he reached for the memory, it dissolved, leaving only the faint, unsettling feeling of something unfinished, something left behind that he was meant to find.

A name lingered on his tongue, fading even as he became aware of it: *Lily.* He felt sure she had been there, in that strange dreamscape, though he couldn’t place her presence. It was as if she had been just out of sight, her voice blending with the wind, her laughter echoing faintly in the distance. In the pit of his stomach, he felt a sense of loss, of separation, though he couldn’t understand why. They were bound somehow, tied together by invisible threads he could sense even now, but in the dream, she had felt distant, unreachable.

Jason turned onto his side, frustration building as the pieces slipped further from his grasp. It was more than a dream; it had been a message, or maybe a memory of a place he was supposed to find, a part of his life he had yet to live or maybe had already lived before. He tried to steady his breathing, closing his eyes and letting the silence of the room settle over him, but the uneasy feeling remained, a quiet whisper at the edge of his thoughts, pulling him back toward that strange, elusive vision.

He glanced at his phone on the bedside table, the screen dark but comforting in its familiar, solid presence. He considered texting Lily, but what would he even say? That he’d dreamed of her in some unknown forest, feeling the weight of her presence even though he hadn’t seen her? The thought was absurd, yet something about it felt urgent, pressing. He had the distinct sense that whatever was unfolding between them was no longer confined to waking hours, that it was seeping into the hidden places in his mind, places he couldn’t control.

Jason glanced at his phone again, fingers hovering over the screen as he tried to find the right words. Everything about this felt strange and heavy, like he was stepping into territory he didn’t fully understand. But the memory of the dream clung to him, vivid and unshakable, urging him forward. Before he could overthink it, he typed out a quick message.

**Jason:** *Hey. Are you up? Can you meet me at our usual spot?*

He hit send, his heart pounding as he waited for her response. It was barely dawn, and the sky outside his window was a deep, inky blue, tinged with the faintest hint of morning light. For a moment, he worried she’d think he was crazy, that showing up at this hour with nothing but a strange dream would make him seem unhinged. But the sense of urgency gnawed at him, growing stronger with every passing minute.

A few seconds later, his phone buzzed with a response.

**Lily:** *Yeah. Couldn’t sleep. I’ll be there in 10.*

He exhaled, feeling a strange mixture of relief and tension as he grabbed his jacket and headed out into the chilly morning air. The streets were deserted, the world wrapped in the quiet stillness that only existed before dawn. As he made his way to the park, the dream replayed in his mind, images flashing before his eyes like fleeting snapshots—the towering trees, the shadowy path, the feeling of being pulled toward something he couldn’t see.

When he reached their spot beneath the old maple tree, Lily was already there, sitting on a quiet bench, her face bathed in the soft, bluish light of dawn. She was staring out over the pond, her expression distant, and when he joined her, she gave him a tired smile.

“Couldn’t sleep either, huh?” she said, a faint smile tugging at her lips, though her eyes held that same distant, searching look he’d noticed more often lately.

He nodded, feeling a little ridiculous but pushing through. “Yeah. I… I had this dream, and it’s been bugging me all morning. I couldn’t shake it.”

Her eyes widened slightly, a glimmer of recognition flickering across her face. “Let me guess… a forest? Tall trees, a winding path?”

Jason’s pulse quickened, a chill running down his spine. “How did you know?”

She looked away, her fingers tracing the thin scars of the bench. “I had the same dream. It was… unsettling. I felt like I was supposed to find something—or someone. I kept hearing your voice, but every time I tried to follow it, you’d disappear.”

Jason exhaled, feeling the weight of the dream settle more heavily over them, their shared experience deepening the strange bond between them. “It’s like we were… there, together. But it didn’t feel like a normal dream. It felt real, like a memory.”

Lily nodded slowly, her brow furrowed. “Exactly. It was as if we’d been there before, or maybe… like we’re supposed to go there.”

They stood in silence, both grappling with the implications of their shared vision, the invisible threads that seemed to pull them closer with each strange experience. Jason took a step closer, his voice low, as if speaking too loudly might break the spell.

“Do you think… do you think it means something? All of this?” He gestured between them, his words filled with a mixture of awe and fear. “The dreams, the synchronicities, even our families… It’s like there’s something hidden, something connecting us that we can’t see.”

Lily’s expression softened, her eyes searching his with a depth that made Jason’s breath catch. A flicker of vulnerability crossed her face, a quiet uncertainty that mirrored the questions echoing in his own heart. “I don’t know,” she said softly, her voice carrying a tremor she couldn’t quite hide. “But… it feels like we’re meant to find out, doesn’t it? Like… maybe everything’s been leading us here, to this.”

She reached out slowly, her fingers intertwining with his, grounding him with a warmth that contrasted sharply against the chill in the air. Her hand was small but steady, the gentle pressure reassuring as if to say that no matter what lay ahead, they would face it together. Jason felt the tension in his chest ease, her presence a calm in the midst of the unknown. There was something unspoken between them, a quiet understanding that whatever force had drawn them together wasn’t finished with them yet.

“Whatever this is,” she continued, her voice steady but filled with an unguarded honesty, “whatever’s pulling us together, I think we’re supposed to see it through.” Her eyes held his, her gaze unwavering, as if she were anchoring him with her own resolve. “I’m not saying it isn’t scary,” she added, her voice barely above a whisper. “But maybe… maybe there’s something we’re supposed to find. Something that only makes sense when we’re together.”

Jason felt a surge of emotion he couldn’t quite name—something that went beyond logic, beyond the neatly ordered life he’d always known. She was right; there was a purpose behind their connection, a force that defied reason but felt as real as the ground beneath their feet. He didn’t understand it, didn’t know where it would lead, but standing here with her, he found himself willing to follow that pull, to let go of his questions and step into the unknown.

Slowly, he gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, the words coming to him with a clarity he hadn’t expected. “Then we’ll see it through, together. Whatever’s waiting for us, whatever answers are out there… I want to face them with you.”

A faint smile touched Lily’s lips, her gaze softening as she looked at him, her eyes reflecting a quiet gratitude. She nodded, their silent agreement settling over them like a vow, a commitment forged not out of certainty but out of trust.

As the weeks went on, the strange synchronicities only intensified. It was no longer just the occasional finishing of each other’s sentences or mirroring each other’s gestures. It became something deeper, something that seemed to weave through their days like an invisible thread. Jason would begin a sentence, only to have Lily finish it in perfect alignment, her voice echoing his thoughts as if she’d pulled the words directly from his mind. At first, they laughed it off, their shared amusement a balm against the growing strangeness. But as it happened more frequently, laughter gave way to shared glances filled with unspoken questions.

They’d reach for the same item at the same time, their hands brushing in a way that felt electric, charged with a familiarity they couldn’t explain. Sometimes, they’d both move to do something in unison, like turning to look out a window or walking in the same direction without speaking. It was as if they were tethered together by an unseen force, their movements and thoughts flowing as one, without the need for words.

Then there were the memories—half-formed, shadowy recollections that seemed to bleed into their conversations, slipping through the cracks of their shared moments. They’d talk about childhood experiences, only to stumble upon details that didn’t quite add up, moments that felt like they belonged to both of them and yet, somehow, to neither.

One evening, as they sat on a park bench beneath the fading light of dusk, Jason started talking about a family trip to a lake. He could picture it vividly—the cool morning air, the mist rising from the water, and the way his family had rented a small red rowboat. He remembered dangling his hand over the side, trailing his fingers through the rippling water as they drifted lazily across the lake.

Lily’s face lit up as he spoke, and she chimed in, almost without thinking. “We did that too. We went to this lake up north, and I remember my family renting a boat… though ours was blue. I used to let my fingers trail through the water too, watching the ripples spread.” She laughed softly, as though reliving a cherished memory. But then her brow furrowed, her expression tinged with confusion. “It’s so strange, though. It feels like… like I can almost picture your red boat too, even though I know we never had one.”

Jason felt a chill creep down his spine, a strange mixture of recognition and disorientation washing over him. “That’s… weird,” he murmured. “I can picture the blue boat now, like I’ve seen it somewhere before, even though I know that’s not right.”

They exchanged a glance, both sensing the eerie similarity between their memories, the way the details overlapped yet contradicted each other, like two halves of a story struggling to fit.

A few days later, the topic came up again when they were grabbing groceries together. They were wandering down the aisles, laughing about some of the strange items they found, when Lily stopped abruptly, her eyes narrowing as though a distant memory had resurfaced.

“You know,” she began, her voice soft and reflective, “when I was a kid, I used to be terrified of getting separated from my mom in places like this. The tall shelves made me feel so small, like they were closing in on me. I got lost once…”

Jason nodded, almost instinctively, feeling a strange familiarity with her words that made his chest tighten. “It was in the cereal aisle,” he interrupted, the words slipping out without thought. “You stood there, calling out, but it was so crowded that no one could hear you. And you—” he hesitated, suddenly aware of how strange it was that he knew this, that he could feel it so vividly. “You were holding a box of… Frosted Flakes, right?”

Lily froze, her eyes widening as she stared at him in shock. “Jason, I… I’ve never told you that,” she whispered, her voice barely audible. “I haven’t told anyone about the Frosted Flakes. I didn’t even remember that part until just now.”

The color drained from Jason’s face as he tried to reconcile what he’d just said, how he could know something so specific, something she’d never shared. He could practically see her there, a small, frightened child clutching the box, her wide eyes darting around as the shelves towered over her, the fluorescent lights casting long shadows that only deepened her fear.

“I don’t know how I knew that,” he admitted, shaking his head, as a chill ran through him. “It’s like… it’s like I can picture it. Like I was there.”

Lily’s hands trembled slightly as she tightened her grip on the grocery cart, her gaze distant, unfocused. “I… I don’t understand this, Jason. How can you know something that I barely remember myself?”

They stood there in the middle of the aisle, surrounded by shelves of cereal and brightly colored boxes, but it felt like they were the only two people in the world. The strange connection between them, the feeling that their lives were somehow woven together in ways they couldn’t explain, pressed down on them, as if an invisible force was pulling them closer, binding them in a web they couldn’t yet see.

“Do you think…” Jason began, his voice barely a whisper. “Do you think there’s more to this than just coincidence? Like… maybe our lives have been connected somehow, even before we met.”

Lily’s eyes met his, a flicker of fear and wonder mingling in her gaze. “I don’t know, but it’s starting to feel that way,” she admitted.

As they continued down the grocery aisle, Jason and Lily passed the baking supplies—rows of pie fillings, cans of cherries and blueberries stacked neatly on the shelves. Jason’s gaze lingered on the bright red cherries, a flash of memory stirring in him, vivid and unexpected.

“Cherry pie,” he murmured, the words slipping out before he could stop them.

Lily looked over at him, her interest piqued. “Cherry pie?”

Jason nodded, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “It was this tradition in my family. Every time we drove upstate, we’d stop in this little town. There was this old diner there, nothing special—just faded booths and a neon sign—but they had cherry pie. My parents would order a slice for everyone, even if we weren’t that hungry.” He laughed softly, the memory so vivid he could almost taste it. “It was so tart, it’d make your mouth pucker. I can still taste it.”

A smile of recognition spread across Lily’s face, her eyes lighting up. “My family did something like that too! Only…” she hesitated, and Jason saw her gaze drift to the blueberry pie filling on the shelf, a slight frown creasing her forehead.

“It was blueberry pie,” he said, the words coming out as though he’d pulled them straight from her mind. “Your family would always get blueberry.”

Lily’s eyes widened, her expression a mixture of surprise and confusion. “Yes… blueberry,” she whispered, as though she was realizing it for the first time. “But it’s strange… I can almost taste the cherry pie too, just the way you described it. The tartness… I can feel it, like I’ve had it before. But we never ordered cherry.”

Jason’s smile faded as he stared at her, feeling an eerie familiarity creep over him. “I can taste the blueberry,” he admitted quietly, a shiver running down his spine. “Like I’ve had it before, even though my family never ordered it. It’s just… there.”

They stood there in silence, surrounded by cans of pie filling and the hum of the grocery store, each of them grappling with the unexplainable feeling that their memories had somehow begun to merge, to bleed into each other in ways that defied logic. It was like they were sharing pieces of a past that was both theirs and not theirs, fragments of lives that overlapped in places they couldn’t yet understand.

Jason finally broke the silence, his voice filled with a quiet awe. “It’s like our memories… like they’re blending together somehow. Maybe… maybe this connection between us goes back further than we know.”

Lily nodded slowly, her face a mixture of wonder and apprehension.

They walked on in silence, each lost in thought, the aisles around them stretching endlessly, filled with shelves of ordinary items that now felt strangely significant. And as they continued through the grocery store, the faint taste of cherry and blueberry lingered in Jason’s mind, blurring the lines of past and present, memory and reality, until he wasn’t sure where his own memories ended and hers began.

As they walked home that evening, Jason couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something deeper lurking beneath the surface, that these memories were more than just eerie coincidences. They felt like clues to something hidden, something neither of them could yet see. And with every shared glance, every half-finished memory, he felt that invisible thread between them draw tighter, binding them to a truth he was both desperate and terrified to uncover.

One crisp afternoon, as they strolled down the main street on their way to grab coffee, Jason’s gaze was drawn to an old, weathered shop on the corner, tucked between more modern storefronts. It looked out of place, like a remnant from another time, its exterior worn by years of wind and weather. The paint was faded, a washed-out shade that might have once been a cheerful yellow but now looked more like dull ochre. The windows were thick with dust, obscuring whatever lay inside, and an old wooden sign above the door read “Crafter’s Cove” in chipped, curling letters that barely caught the light. A collection of wind chimes hung from the awning, tangled and silent, swaying faintly as though stirred by some unseen force.

Jason slowed, staring at the shop with a sense of familiarity that prickled at the edge of his mind. “I feel like I’ve been here before,” he murmured, the words slipping out without thought. His family would never have come here; they weren’t the type to venture into small, odd craft stores. And yet, as he looked at the faded storefront, he felt a pull, like a thread connecting him to something he couldn’t name.

Lily stopped beside him, her eyes widening as she took in the sight of the shop. “That’s weird… I feel the same way,” she whispered, her gaze distant, searching. She stared at the weathered exterior, her brow furrowing as though trying to draw up a memory from deep within. “I could swear I’ve been inside a shop like this before, but I know it looked… different somehow. Like it wasn’t so faded and rundown.”

Jason nodded, feeling an inexplicable urge to keep looking, to push through the dusty glass and discover what lay hidden inside. “It’s like… a dream I can’t remember.”

Lily took a step closer, peering at the dimly lit window. “I remember… going into a place like this with my family once. My mom was looking for paints or something, and there were these cute little sculptures on a shelf near the front,” she said slowly, as if piecing together the memory as she spoke.

“They were little clay animals,” Jason interrupted, surprising himself. “A tiny fox, a rabbit with a little chipped ear, and… a turtle painted in shades of blue and green, with a little flower on its shell.”

Lily turned to him, her mouth falling open in shock. “Yes,” she whispered, her eyes wide with disbelief. “Exactly like that. The fox was painted orange with these tiny white spots, and the rabbit looked like it was about to hop away.”

Jason shook his head, his heart pounding. “I’ve never been in this store. I’ve never seen those sculptures in my life, Lily. But… it’s like I know them. Like they’re etched into my memory, even though I’ve never set foot in there.”

They stood there, the dusty windows and faded paint somehow feeling more significant, more alive, than the bustling street around them. Jason could almost see the sculptures on the shelf just inside the door, could picture the way the light would catch the colors, the way his fingers would itch to reach out and touch them.

Jason shivered, the sensation creeping over him like a cold mist settling into his bones. The logical part of his mind insisted it was nothing, that it was just an odd series of coincidences layered on top of a natural connection. But he couldn’t deny the feeling that lurked just beneath the surface, a quiet certainty that there was more to this than chance. It was like he and Lily were only seeing the edges of something vast and complex, a puzzle they were part of without fully understanding its shape.

They continued walking, the shared silence stretching between them. Jason’s thoughts churned, trying to grasp what all of this meant. Every instinct told him that something lay hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be unearthed. He felt like a traveler lost in a maze, each turn pulling him closer to a truth he could sense but not yet see. It was as if he and Lily held two halves of the same story, both essential but incomplete, their lives tangled together by a force beyond either of their control.

Finally, he broke the silence. “Do you think… do you think there’s something we’re supposed to remember? Something we’ve both forgotten?”

Lily glanced at him, her eyes reflecting the same confusion and curiosity he felt. “I don’t know,” she admitted, her voice barely a whisper. “But it’s like… it’s like I’m on the edge of a memory I can’t reach, like something’s pulling me toward it but it’s just out of sight.”

They shared a look, the weight of unspoken questions pressing down on them, wrapping around them like an invisible thread drawing tighter with each passing day. The puzzle pieces continued to hover just beyond their grasp, teasing them with glimpses of a truth that felt both inevitable and unknowable.

 

One night, they lay stretched out on a blanket in the grass, their breaths visible in the cool air as they stared up at the vast night sky. The stars sparkled above them, like fragments of secrets too old to be understood, scattered across the universe. The silence stretched around them, punctuated only by the occasional rustling of leaves and the distant hum of the world beyond. They’d been talking for hours, sharing fragments of their pasts, trying to trace the lines that seemed to connect them—but every detail only led them back to the same unsettling truth, a realization neither of them could name but both felt.

Jason finally broke the silence, his voice quiet and hesitant. “Do you think…” he paused, swallowing hard, as if saying it out loud would make it all too real. “Do you think maybe… we’ve known each other before?”

Lily turned to look at him, her eyes wide and searching. Her face was cast in shadows, her expression unreadable, but he could see the flicker of something in her gaze, something he couldn’t name. “Like… in another life?” she whispered, as if afraid of the answer.

Jason shrugged, though he felt a strange sense of relief in voicing the thought that had been plaguing him, haunting him, since their first encounter. “I don’t know. It sounds crazy, but… there are things about you, about us, that just feel like… like they’ve always been there.” He could feel his heart pounding, his mind racing with the impossible possibility that they were somehow part of each other’s story long before now.

Lily took a deep, shaky breath, her gaze drifting back to the sky. “I’ve felt that too,” she murmured, her voice barely audible. “Like I’ve known you before. Like meeting you wasn’t the first time, but… the first time I can remember.” She hugged her knees to her chest, the vulnerability in her posture mirroring the tension growing between them. “But what does that even mean, Jason? Are we… Are we supposed to be together? Is this all just fate, or… or something else?”

Jason felt a tightness in his chest, an ache he couldn’t explain. “I don’t know. But what if it’s all just some… cosmic fluke? Like maybe we’re reading too much into this because we want it to mean something?” He hated the thought, but he couldn’t ignore it either. They were falling together so easily, as if by some design, yet the mystery of it all was beginning to weigh on him, filling him with a mixture of wonder and dread.

Lily’s face tightened, her confusion clear as she stared into the night. “But it doesn’t feel like a fluke,” she whispered, her voice laced with desperation. “Every time we talk, every memory we share, it’s like we’re… I don’t know, like we’re peeling back layers of something that’s been buried. Something that we’re supposed to find.” She turned to him, her eyes glistening in the dim light. “Maybe it’s a past life, or fate, or… or maybe it’s just that…” She faltered, her voice catching, and then she forced herself to finish. “Or maybe it’s just that we’re supposed to love each other.”

Jason’s breath caught at her words, his heart racing as he struggled to process the implications. The idea of love felt almost too simple, too human to explain what they were experiencing, yet it was the only answer that felt real, something he could understand in a world that suddenly felt vast and unknowable. “But why, Lily?” he asked, his voice laced with a quiet desperation. “Why would love feel this way? Why would it come with… with memories that aren’t ours, and feelings that don’t make sense?”

They lay there in silence, the weight of their questions pressing down on them, suffocating and profound. Jason reached for her hand, lacing his fingers through hers, grounding himself in the warmth of her touch, the one tangible thing he could hold onto in the midst of so much uncertainty.

“Maybe we’re not supposed to know,” he said finally, his voice a rough whisper. “Maybe it’s enough to just… be here, together, and let whatever this is unfold. Maybe it’ll make sense one day, or maybe it never will. But I can’t deny that… that I’m meant to be here, right now, with you.”

Lily squeezed his hand, her grip tight, like she was afraid he’d disappear if she let go. “I feel the same,” she whispered, her voice trembling. “But I’m scared, Jason. I’m scared of what this means, of what we’ll find if we keep looking.”

“Me too,” he admitted, his heart heavy with the weight of their shared fear. “But I’m more scared of walking away, of never knowing what this really is.”

They lay in silence, clutching each other’s hands as if they were lifelines, tethered together by a force neither of them could understand. And as the stars shimmered above them, endless and unreachable, they felt like two small pieces caught in something much bigger, a story too vast for them to comprehend, yet one they were bound to unravel, together.

It’s been a long year in so many ways but it feels so good to hit 25lbs down from my highest weight. I hit 207 right around new years and now I’m back under my pre-COVID weight. I was 186 most of my early 20s with a little fluctuation here and there.

I did this mostly through diet changes and restructuring my habits like starting every morning with a cup of hot lemon water instead of coffee.

Today I went and got a gym membership which was super anxiety inducing but I freaking did it.  I really want to focus on keeping up momentum through the holiday season which can often be very stressful and fattening.

I live my life as a fairly typical guy, yet harbour an inner core that is very feminine. My dude side has always tended to be more of a leader; however my feminine side feels the opposite, so if you prefer to be a ""take charge"" person, and comfortable making decisions for others, we would get along great.

I would love to explore topics such as clothes, relationships, shopping. Or I am happy to talk about most subjects...

Age is not an issue for me. It's compatibility.

1ghep1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1ghep1j/argument_with_a_colleague/,Argument with a colleague.,"So for context, I've been in a job nearly 4 months and sadly had a bad argument/spat with a colleague maybe about 3 weeks ago.

For the first 3 months or so, she had been a very helpful colleague and I did feel that she went above and beyond being helpful, even with little things which I genuinely was very appreciative off.

For a few days before what happened I felt she was in a bit of a bad mood and amn't sure why.

Maybe I was misreading things and I did detect a hint of a do we like each other or do we not situation developing between us and yes, and I say this out of respect for her as my colleague, I am aware that even though I'm interested in getting on well with her and working well with her, I should be very careful about crossing ""that"" line.

I had brought in some nice chocolates to share with everyone and offered her some also which she accepted and was very appreciative of, like with everyone else.

Again, I know can be accused of blurring the lines a bit her but I brought in a nice lindor chocolate bar and gave it to her as a thank you for all your over the last few months which I appreciate very much. She accepted it but ate the head off and reacted very badly to the gesture. 

I didn't react and just took it on the chin but I upset about her reaction and I don't think I'm being unreasonable feeling that.

I can tell how she's been looking at me and talking to some of her friends about me, she does feel bad about what happened but hasn't apologised and has tried to go back to talking to me as if nothing has happened. 

I made polite conversation with her have also kept my distance a bit as a result afterwards. 

I'm debating if I should invite her out for lunch or coffee and try to brooch what happened. I'm sorry for the story but wanted to give as much context in as non biased way as I reasonably can.
