Hello fellow redditors,

I've recently acquired a B75 brewer from a famous chinese online retailer, and have brewed like 5-6 cups with it as of now. I'm brewing mostly on V60 and would like to share my opinions about their differences:

1. V60 cups tend to have more fidelity/definition with fruity or acidic notes, whereas B75 has more definition with the more bitter/sweeter notes. I have some washed Kenyan beans that say ""milk chocolate, peaches, plum"" on the package, on V60 I can clearly get the peaches and milky chocolate but with a similarly extracting cup on B75 I get more plums and cocoa taste, ""sourness"" and ""sweetness"" is almost the same

2. B75 is _really_ fast. One of my brews was with a natural Ethiopian bean, which is notoriously prone to clogging on V60, had no issues with the B75. Total brew was around 3 mins, (with 3 pours and Melitta style cheap papers) which was not any slower than the washed beans I used.

I'm currently doing 16g coffee to 256g water, with Coffee Chronicler pourover recipe for B75. Do you have either of them? Did you have similar experiences with them?",1,1738850843.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

	This is Walter Kerman reporting. Surick and Maberry have safely returned to Kerbin from the latest Munar expedition, their capsule filled with valuable new scientific samples, and an unexpected passenger, a small rodent. Officials at the KSC were contacted even before the Kerbalnauts were picked up by recovery crews, and were unable to provide a definitive explanation, the silence suggesting they are just as baffled as we are.  
  
	Naturally, conspiracy theories have already taken flight, with some claiming this is proof of indigenous Munar life. While the scientific community is quick to dismiss such wild speculations, the incident has sparked renewed discussion about planetary contamination protocols. The rodent, we are told was named Newton by Mayberry, has been given a comfortable new home at the KSC, where he seems blissfully unaware of the stir he has caused.

https://preview.redd.it/ssz61g7wxihe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c9f56ac2d7212d40a08e30553ba1872e2ba5bc9

	Maberry’s return brings with it a treasure trove of geological samples collected from the Northwest Crater, basalt and breccia formed by ancient meteor impacts. These findings will provide crucial data about the Mun’s geologic history and its violent past. The completion of the mission also fulfills contracts to plant a flag on the Mun and collect scientific data from its surface, marking yet another success for the space program.  
  
	Meanwhile, deeper out in space, Valentina and Megdas continue on their long trip back to Kerbin aboard the Endeavour. Closer to home, a second Mun mission is already on its way. On board the Oddity\\\*, Jedrick and Myberry are en route to the Midlands, tasked with science collection and, of course, planting another flag on the Mun. Maberry is excited to be returning to the Mun so quickly, though Gene has expressed mock frustration that Rockomax does not send enough scientists on their missions to be recruited into the Icarus Program.  
  
	This mission marks Jedrick’s return to space and first flight for the Icarus Program. Jedrick was the first stranded Kerbal rescued from the catastrophic mission that led to the Icarus Program’s first rescue fleet. His return to space is a testament to both his skill and perseverance.  
  
	\\\*\\\*A graduate of the Kerbal Naval Academy, Jedrick built a reputation as one of the most proficient pilots at landing on mobile naval landing platforms. These platforms were used for refueling during the time when aircraft did not have the range for transoceanic flights. During this time he wrote a treatise on liquid fueled rocket engines, which caught the attention of the Rockomax Conglomerate who hired him to work on their space exploration program. Now Jedrick has a second chance to fly in space, and has been tapped by the Icarus Program as mission commander for the Oddity. It is a role he takes very seriously, though his characteristic wit and dry humor remain very much intact.

	As Maberry stepped onto the Mun’s surface for the second time, she took a moment to gaze at the vast expanse around her. The stark, airless landscape stretched in all directions, punctuated only by the jagged ridges of impact craters. Then, as she turned, she caught sight of Kerbin rising over the Mun’s horizon. Her voice crackled over the radio, filled with awe:

“Eureka, KSC—Kerbin is really round!”\*\*\*

While Maberry is enjoying her returned to the Mun, her erstwhile companion, Newton, is safely in his new home at the KSC.

	“KSC this is the Oddity,” Jedrick called over the comm systems, calm but firm. “We seem to have a problem here.”

	“A problem?” piped up Maberry, her voice sharp with concern. “With what?”  
  
	“Jedrick, this is Bobak,” Bobak’s voice crackled over the comm system, his tone steady but urgent. “Please specify the nature of the problem.”  
  
	“One of the critical systems is broken down,” Jedrick’s voice was dark.  
  
	“Oh no!” exclaimed Maberry.  
  
	“Jedrick, clarify which system is broken,” Bobak pressed, the tension in his voice rising.  
  
	“The hot water system is out,” Jedrick’s voice was almost deadpan.  
  
	Silence.  
  
	“Wait,” Mayberry finally said, confusion evident in her voice. “None of the life support or propulsion systems depend on hot water.”  
  
	“Jedrick, hot water is not a critical system,” Bobak’s voice was hesitant.

	“You aren’t up here drinking cold koffee,”V Jedrick grumbled while audibly choking down the offending beverage. “No Kerbal can live like this.”  
  
	“Jedrick, you have less than a day before landing on Kerbin,” Gene’s voice over the comm was stern yet tinged with amusement. “You can survive without hot koffee until you get back.”  
  
	“Almost a day without hot koffee?!” Jedrick’s tone was incredulous. “Surely you can cobble together a way to get me some!”  
  
	“Jedrick, you have limited resources up there,” Gene seemed to be holding back a chuckle. “We are not going to rip apart another system just so you can have hot koffee.”  
  
	“You better make sure this thing does not break down again,” Jedrick grumbled. “I’m not flying another mission with cold koffee.”  
  
	“I’m not flying another mission with a pilot who gives me a heart attack,” muttered Mayberry. “Cold koffee a critical system indeed.”  
  
	“We will get Bill right on the problem,” Gene’s tone was light hearted. “No future mission will suffer from cold koffee.”

	Jedrick and Maberry have safely returned to Kerbin, bringing back valuable surface samples from the Midlands. Preliminary analysis suggests these rocks have been exposed to high levels of cosmic radiation, a factor that future long-duration Mun missions will need to account for.

	With another flag planted and all mission objectives completed, the Icarus Program continues to push the boundaries of exploration. One thing is certain—whether it’s groundbreaking science, daring piloting, or the all-important matter of hot koffee, the spirit of Kerbal spaceflight remains as strong as ever.

	\\\* Jedrick is based on Jim Lovell, who experimented with liquid fueled model rockets, became the first astronaut to fly to space four times, and one of three astronauts to travel to the moon twice, not to mention commanded Apollo 13.

1ij37r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/glioblastoma/comments/1ij37r9/symptom_timeline_time_confusion/,Symptom timeline / time confusion.,"Hello everyone. 

My mom just called me to say she shut down the computer so we can leave work. We work together and we clock out at 17:00 / 5pm. When she called me it was 15:00. I told her its 3pm and she replied ""oh then why did you call me?"" Which i did not. :(

Our timeline so far

* 4 Sept 2024 Diagnosed
* 13 Sept 2024 Had surgery - Complete removal. Last 6 days before surgery she had turned into a zombie. Only getting up by herself and needing guidance to do anything even eat. She recovered to 90% herself after surgery. Like really 
* 13 Oct 2024 Started TMZ & RD which stopped in the middle due to her blood counts being so bad she got hospitalized (and had platelet transfusion) for 20 days. 
* 15-31 Dec 2024 Finished the second half of the RD sessions without TMZ. 
* 31 Dec 2024 1st MRI post op shows something new but so small that cannot be decided on what it is.
* 27 Jan 2024 started first 28day Cycle with reduced dose of TMZ since we had issues with it before.

Currently she is functioning on her own. I notice some random signs of confusion but mostly she finds it hard to get up the stairs. 

I guess my question is could that small thingie from the MRI be a huge thing now ? I mean from what i saw before the first surgery things can deteriorate very very fast. I know it can be a huge thing idk why i ask.

I'm trying to prepare for next steps like lets say we do another MRI soon and we find new tumor, how is it decided if it's worth to operate again or not ? My guess is since treatment in the first place didn't give her much time (if this is indeed the case) - basically gave her 3 good months - it's not worth the struggle to try again ? Do the doctors tend to push for more surgeries? Should we ask for it if not recommended? 

Should i start testing my mother to check her cognition levels ? We don't speak much when together so things might slip away... like they did the first time... Her coworkers noticed signs that were not visible to me during more ordinary stuff like car ride to work or a small walk etc. It was only when she could no longer operate on things (like open the facet or make coffee) that i saw what was going on.

  
I guess i just wanted to share .. I know there is no answer to my questions. Hugs to everyone in here.

It always starts a fight. He hasn't been able to give as much as me due to work, but I feel like it's dragging out a bit and by now he should be organising more dates/doing more romantic things for me.

I have a great relationship with my boyfriend. We have been together for five years, and this issue bothers me a lot. However, I have never once wanted to break up with him. I just find it hard to communicate with him because he gets defensive and upset whenever I insinuate that he isn't doing enough.

Basically, we moved to London together in September for my master's degree. We were in Uni together for four years elsewhere and, last year I worked in retail for a year while he did his masters degree. During his masters, he was stressed and broke. I made all the effort on the dates, I payed for our holiday in full and I was constantly helping him through a stressful year (just doing whatever he wanted to do, I visited him, he never visited me, I paid for mostly everything). That was all fine. In the summer, he travelled for three months on the small savings he had. I worked and saved to move to London for my master's degree. He moved with me and now we live together while I am completing my masters. He is struggling to get a job related to his education (engineering), and is currently working in hospitality. Because of this, I pay for everything. I got a scholarship for my masters and had saved up enough, so all he pays for is rent and his own food shop and part of the bills. I have bought all furniture, cutlery, bedding, everything in our room, cleaning supplies etc and I have since paid for flights for him twice. He also owes me under a grand but I don't care when he gives it back as long as it is before I run out of money. Important: I'm not mad about the money, but its good context. I know if I was broke, he would do it for me, and in future he will probably have a better paying job than I will.

My issue is, that after all of this money, time and care I have spent on him, I feel like he does so little for me. You know that saying that's like 'if your partner can only give 40, you give 60 - some days it will be 20, 80 or some days 50 - 50'. Well I feel like it's been consistently 30 70 for a long time now. I struggle with my health (I have a serious illness), and I am stressed at times doing my masters, but I feel like the attention is always on him - that he doesn't have enough money or a good job yet (either do I but I don't complain). I feel like I'm always trying to make him happy, offering to pay for things, buying him gifts, I bought him flowers and chocolates just last week because he got a job interview and all he said was 'oh I don't like those chocolates' but he ate them anyway??

When I read through our texts now, he rarely replies to my messages. If I send a funny meme or a cute message he doesn't even respond... I can't remember the last time he did something random and genuinely nice for me. I thought of him cleaning the house there - but that would be giving him too much credit, because I thanklessly clean the house all the time anyway. I'm realising that maybe the way he used to show love was paying for dates (even if I planned them) and now that he has no money he doesn't do this. I wish he would even just make me food, or wake me up with a coffee, or go on a walk with me, or do anything. I do ask sometimes 'can you make me a coffee' or 'do you want to go on a walk' and I don't feel good because he's just doing it cos I asked.

I feel like he does nothing nice unless I ask. And when I read through our messages or look at my photos of the past YEAR, I find proof of all I have done for him. Yes, he got me a nice Christmas present. Yes, I know he loves me. We have sex. But there's just so little extra being done considering I also have my struggles. For example, I have diabetes and I have asked him to download an app on his phone so he can track it about ten times in the past year. He still hasn't done it. Any time I ever bring up that I don't feel loved enough or cared by him he gets SO UPSET. We've been together 5 years so I just know the conversation wont go well. He says its a horrible thing to say. But its true, its how I feel, I'm feeling neglected. Its gone on too long. I know he'll say 'but I'm broke' or 'im stressed interviewing for jobs' or 'i organised a date a month ago' which would all be true, but its just not enough. How can I explain this to him in a nice way?",2,1738850028.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1ij2zbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/superleague/comments/1ij2zbe/super_league_launch_event_my_experience_photos/,Super League Launch Event - My experience (+photos & videos!),"As likely all of you know I attended the Super League launch event yesterday at the Coop Arena in Manchester. As I'd never been to anything like it and had no idea what to expect, I thought I'd post my general thoughts and a runthrough of the day for anyone who may be interested. I will start posting interviews from tomorrow (one for each day before the season starts!)

Firstly I just wanted to thank everyone again as it was a totally surreal experience being there, and I only got the opportunity because of everyone here who comments/subscribes/upvotes. I can't thank everyone enough!

Overall I thought the event was great, and it actually exceeded my expectations in every facet. The arena was great, the space we were in was fantastic and there was tea/coffee and actually some nice food for everyone in attendance.

When the event started about 1:30pm Brian Carney did a roughly 30 minute presentation where he spoke to head coaches/players from every team (including the women's/disability rugby league teams) as well as Rhodri Jones and Adam Hills. The whole atmosphere was pretty casual and was genuinely good fun to watch and be around.

Some information I picked up from the presentation that I didn't know/thought was interesting to note:

*  Super League is 30 years old in March, hooray for us!
* There were around 200 people at the event
* Over 10,000 tickets have been sold through the Wigan/Warrington clubs for the Las Vegas game (which they are very happy with)
* Most clubs are reporting record season ticket sales, and they are expecting a record crowd across the board in Round One
* Danny McGuire and Daryl Powell were clearly good friends, and both accused each other of needing to dye their hair
* Ryan Brierley said the takeover stuff hadn't effected them that badly as a squad, but had helped to galvanise them. My impression was that the takeover is sorted from the way he was speaking, but it wasn't confirmed
* Harry Maguire was extremely impressed with Wigan when he trained with them, and allegedly commented that Man United needed to get some of their team spirit
* Junior Nsemba can't have fun in Las Vegas as he is too young to drink - he said he will be drinking fruit shoots and playing chess all weekend
* There is hope of a wheelchair rugby game being played in Vegas next year, although again not confirmed

After the presentation was completed it was a bit of a free for all at the back of the room to get access to players/coaches and have a conversation with them. Everyone was incredibly friendly and easy to get on with and I had no issues at all (despite having no experience doing this and being terrified). I've put some pictures of the event below for those that are interested in the layout and seeing what it was all about.

Overall the experience was brilliant, and I had great fun pretending I knew what I was doing as a journalist for a day. If anyone wants specifics or has any questions about anything then just let me know and I'd be happy to answer!

Keep an eye out for the interviews over the next week, there are some really good ones in there and I will be tagging people who had their questions asked (I had 10 pages of A4 printed, but didn't manage to get them all in so sorry in advance!). There is also one interview with someone I had no idea would be there, and I cannot believe that I got to speak to them and shake their hand so definitely keep your eye out for that!

All day I have that urge to go relieve myself and can’t bring myself to stop somewhere to go. I end up waltzing around with a turtle head peeking out and the feeling is just far too uncomfortable. But when I go in the back of the van, I gotta tell you it’s the most soothing feeling I have felt! I just can’t even explain!

I start my day typically with 3 cups of premium, dark roasted columbian coffee and 4 espresso shots. I mean how else am I supposed to get through the day? In my oversized backpack I pack an empty jumbo peanut butter jar and a full roll of toilet paper. When I’m feeling the viscous concoction of coffee churning in my bowels, I do my stinky work in the back of the van. Perhaps the best part is the smell, however. I just can’t get enough of that earthy, nutty smell! 

 Unfortunately, one time, I started quite the debacle when I accidentally left the jar in the van. Oops. Our manager was extremely upset, and hoped to find the culprit (me, tee hee!) The whole DSP shut down, putting many people out of work for days on end. They even brought in a team of professional private investigators. Finally someone came forward and admitted to it and was fired immediately. I was very saddened by this, but I just couldn’t bring myself to admit to my actions…

Together we have 4 children 7f (from my previous ex but he has been in her life since she was only 6 months old), 5f, 4m, 2f. He is a blue collared man working at the papermill and I have been a stay-at-home mom for 6 years. Together we have been through a lot. We are each other's best friend or worse enemy. We cannot communicate whatsoever. He grew up differently in a more loving home, with better communication. However, he did have to get a job at 15 and raise his siblings and take of his mom (pay the bills... everything). I on the other hand grew up very differently. My mother was very narcistic, would scream and my sister and I so much as children. Started cheating on our stepdad and ran off with another man. At the same time my father also ran off. At nine years old my mother could careless we did not have electricity; we were eating cold green beans out the can. Her new man was her priority. Years later my father came back, and I was forced to go live with him. When I say this man was abusive, he was abusive on every single level imaginable. 13 years old I would take beatings like drunken men at a bar brawl. No one would ever hear me as a child, no one ever saved me. No one protected me. I will admit from then on, I have always been a defensive person with terrible communication skills. My husband's communication is not much better either. His way is by blatantly barking orders like I am some of his coworkers or just gets frustrated that I do not understand his logic the same way he does. My husband and I get into the slightest argument, and he will say I am acting just like my mother (a very, very derogatory term) just to make matters worse, knowing how bad it will make this explode. After doing so, I am the crazy one. He did nothing wrong. This is all my fault. These such events are not frequent, only when they do happen, that is how it plays out.

At this point I should probably note that I do battle major PMS problems after having my last child, these issues are hormonal related that last about a day or two of emotional roller coasters. Followed by a period that I have to wear adult diapers for. It is an absolute nightmare before my period starts. My husband knows this, but it is a joke to him and says I just need to control myself (it is just that easy to do you know). Last weekend for an example I was about to start my period he knew I knew it is whatever. World does not stop spinning for it, got to keep going. We get up and he cooks breakfast for all the kids. As they start eating, I go to prep the potato salad for the family cookout we are attending that day. I started to move a pan out the way for a second so I could start boiling the potatoes. This man looked me in my face and said just was it instead of moving it. That just did it for me. I was already going to clean everything up. Plan was to start the potatoes, by the time the potatoes were done, I could already have everything cleaned up from breakfast. But it is the small shit he always says that he does not stop to think about for a second. I have been cooking and cleaning up after our family of six day after day. Cleaning up after him his spilled coffee he walks around. His dip spit bottles he leaves everywhere, the trails of dirt he tracks into the house every morning at precisely 5:35am. All these little things will build up until I just lose it. I proceed to clean the mess finish the salad. Bathe the children to get the syrup off, dress everyone, bury the septic line the dog once again dug up, come inside, start the laundry so much more. I am fucking boiling at this point; this man is just lying in bed watching TV because it is his day off. I shut the bedroom door behind me a fucking lost my shit on him. I could careless he was laying in that bed. I couldn't care. I feel so damn ran over at this point. He looks at me and says he shouldn't have taken the weekend off. He should have worked. He would rather be there than to deal with me. My whole damn point is he cannot take a single accountability in what he does here. He will not admit when he is wrong. If there is something wrong, it is my fault. Yes, I was wrong for screaming. I should have handled that way better. But here we are. I cannot talk to this man. Every time I try to tell him how I feel it is shut down. If I tell him about my problems, I am battling it is always counteracted with ""I make split second decisions at work that could either save someone's life or take their lives, but I figure it the fuck out"" or ""I deal with bigger problems at work and I don't bring them home pile them up on you! Go get a fucking friend!"". I cannot vent to him about anything. I have no one to talk to and when I tell him that he says well neither do I! I have always been here for him to talk to, either he chooses not to, or I must not be best person to talk to. After last weekend, it was honestly over pretty fast, maybe 2 hours and done. But since he has held it over me. He says it is my fault he cannot stay ""hard"" and that ""what is going through my mind is how can I let my wife talk to me like that when I don't let anyone treat me like that, What does that say about me as a man?"". When he said that to me, I looked at him and I said you are feeling what you put me through for the first two years, when you were running to your ex to talk about our problems, when I was laying on the operating table being cut hip to hip bringing our child to life you were talking to her. For two years I could not figure out why I was not enough for you. Why you always chose to run to her, even though she is married. I suffered for two years. When it stopped and I forgave you and moved on. I do not hold it against you. We moved on and grew together. After saying that he looked at me said see there you go wanting to yell (I do get a little louder but not yelling when I get emotional). He went to leave for work and said, "" Let's just hope you can fix this and see if you can get me hard again."" then left. With the ex being in a thing of the past nearly 4 years ago, I have forgiven him for it. Yes, it hurt me to my core. I have been head over heels for this man since middle school. After the last conversation between the two I threatened to out her to her husband. Before my husband I were together she and him slept together the same week she was marrying her now husband. My husband let that one slip, which I was able to confirm. I will NEVER accuse anyone of anything because I, myself do not like being accused of things especially false allegations. However, I sure as hell will prove.  After my initial threat I still attempted to reach him multiple times, she got to his phone first and deleted and blocked my number and few others I used (even social media). It was not okay for him to be left in the dark about his beloved wife's infidelities, I was fully prepared to give this information to this poor man. Once I did that, it all finally ended. Healing began, forgiveness came through and trust began building. Where we are now does not compare to the way things were then. So many factors are involved now. I recognize I do have a temper with little control, and I shut down easily when I do not want to feel it anymore. This cycle has to break. I have to work on that of course, but what else can I do? I have started antidepressants two weeks ago. It is helping, but that is not a fix for communication.  

At this point if something does not change, I fear our marriage will not make it. We have to start communicating better. I admit I do have so much built up right now with no way to get it out. How do we start to communicate better? How can I initiate better communication with him? Lastly, one thing I need so bad to hear from him is accountability in this. He takes no accountability in why our relationship is the way it is. He sees no wrong in his actions or words and always says "" I am a good man, I know I am a good man! You won't find another man like me!"". I will not say he is not a good man because he is, he is. His heart is filled with pure good intentions and love. I would never take that from him, why would I take what I love about him from him? Sorry for the long and all over the place post, but please I could really use some advice here. I love my husband so much and the thought of a life without him is a life I do not want. Please help us.  ",1,1738849744.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Let me share some of my personal experience with you all. 

I worked a food prep position at a local market for nearly a year. The deli had hired one of the worst supervisors I had ever had the displeasure of meeting. She’d talk loudly in front of customers and others with her work bestie about her “cheating boyfriend”, being in a depression, and other family drama with no filter. She was 20 minutes late for her shift on a good day. And on more than one occasion, would fill a plastic cup with an alcoholic beverage of her choice to sip on as she was working. The reason why she felt she was entitled to do whatever she wanted is that she insists she’d been in the food business for over 20 years, ‘knew her shit’, and therefore was allowed to do what she wanted. This was supposed to be the entity “supervising” me. Lol 

My final straw was when they actually hired her cheating boyfriend in winter of that same year. I am not joking. I overheard some talk about how he had just gotten bailed out of jail and rolled into work the following morning. He had the exact same mannerisms of the woman he was dating. Except, he drunk beer straight out of the can on the food prep line, holding a knife while he bragged about how much weed he could tolerate smoking in a day to his coworker. Over the course of two weeks, he managed to be late every day - if he even showed up at all. That resulted in me having to prep nearly 100+ breakfast sandwiches AND brew coffee by myself. 

I went directly to the store management when I could no longer tolerate it, and politely found a way to say that if they couldn’t address it directly - I had to leave. I couldn’t handle the stress of doing ALL the prep work for what should’ve been a full team of people every morning, and have it done within one hour by the time the store opened. I didn’t even mention that really, they should’ve been the ones to blame for hiring such low-brow people. 

The manager nodded and said she understood with an empathetic tone. She acknowledged my hard work and said that if I ever wished to seek reemployment in the future, that I would be eligible. I accepted those terms and left that very same day. 

Fast forward two years later, and I’m looking for a part time job. I heard that several of the other people I had worked with were leaving - and the others I had complained about so long ago were fired somewhere along that timeline. 

I figured… why not put another application in? That same manager I had spoken with about the job matter was now the owner of the market, along with her husband. I even met the knew deli manager last time I had gone in, and she seemed excited at the prospect of someone who wanted to work mornings.


Fast forward nearly a week later, I still had gotten no phone call. As I tried to call in and inquire about my status, I was asked to leave messages for the managers a couple of times. Yesterday, I finally managed to get through to the husband of the owner. 

I stated simply that I was inquiring about my application. He started speaking quickly and nervously, like “yeah yeah we’ve filled those positions already” and “we’re not hiring right now”. I fell into a dumbfounded 10 second silence. Finally I had to insist and say “Hey, I’m aware of the circumstance last time and if you guys don’t want to hire me, just let me know now. It would be helpful.” 

He sighed into the receiver and said “Yeah, considering the circumstances you wouldn’t be top on our list of consideration”. I said “thank you for being honest.” And hung up.

Bear in mind, these were the same management team that hired the supervisor stealing alcohol on the clock, and the man who chronically drank and got high on the job RIGHT AFTER it was known he’d just been to jail. 

Yet, I was ineligible because I spoke up about something that potentially endangered me, was entirely overwhelming, and an abuse of position. I was the problem. 


When people in this forum tell you that the employers don’t care about you, they mean it. It doesn’t even matter if you try to perform at your personal best. If you show even one sign of… “disloyalty”? And unwillingness to be a mindless peon forever marching through the sludge of your conditions? So that you could continue to be an unfettered profit generation machine? 

They just don’t have time for you.

I’m (22m) and my (19f) girlfriend have been together 3 months. Not super long, yes. However, she’s been acting really distant lately. It went from making me a coffee in the morning, walking me out the door for work to hug and kiss me, to then sending me a text that same morning telling me how amazing last night was and I can’t wait to see you again. To now I won’t get a text until the afternoon, after I’ve said good morning. No more ice coffees or walking me out (I know poor me) and overall not receiving that same energy from before. It’s been about 2 weeks of this. She’s mentioned wanting to be less intimate as in “I’m not in the mood” or “we should wait 2-3 weeks”..
She’s been lying about going to bed and will be up at times way past. All of sudden skipping her morning classes. We’ve been hanging out less and now she’s been using homework as an excuses to not see me. YES, we’ve had this conversation a couple times now and even prior about getting our shit done that’s important. But it wasn’t a factor before that we wouldn’t be able to see each other later those nights. I talked to her last night about it and she said she doesn’t feel this way after I mentioned I feel a little distance and you aren’t acting the same you were before in a nice calm manner. She said that “we are good”.. I can take her at face value but my gut knows something is up whatever it may be. Instead of trying to pry her for answers and repeat this conversation that will get old. What should I do? This is someone I see very very very long term. Atleast I hope but it seems reality is setting in. 

TL;DR - 
• Overall less excitement when she sees me now
• We’ve been hanging out less
• No more little things like the coffee and walking me out
• Using homework as an excuse to not see me
• Randomly wanted to go through my phone last night. I did the same and she was getting nervous 
• never leaves her phone unattended 
• Wants to be less intimate all of a sudden when before she couldn’t handle herself
• Barely hugs me when we first see each other and never wants a kiss",2,1738849689.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

We’re both in our early 20s and had arranged marriage. We went to the same university and knew of each other but never spoke. 

I’m a manager and I get to work from home most days. This enables me to be close to my wife since she’s at home most of the time. She’s still studying and inshallah she finishes in the summer.

My wife has some insecurities about me being too friendly with women. This is because when I was in university, she would see me with women. I think she thinks it’s more than it was because I had a group of friends who I’d mostly hang out with. I don’t interact with non mehrams outside work anymore. She also says that I have a personality that people gravitate towards and that I’m much better looking than her. Despite her needing a lot of reassurance and sometimes checking my phone, we’ve been happy.

Two weeks ago I was in a 121 meeting with a colleague as she works under me. We have a performance and well-being 121 every month as part of my job. My colleague had a recent separation and although I’d rather not, I have to ask if she’s okay. My wife overheard me saying phrases like “I’m here if you want to talk” and “if you need someone to just listen then message me”. This is something we’ve had training on as a team and I’d rather not do it, but it’s part of my role as a manager.

My wife was in the living room with my phone and saw a message where the same colleague sent me a coffee order. To explain, I bought my whole team coffee (3 guys, 2 girls) and this colleague had a long sophisticated order to I told her to text me it before I left to get it. She has my number because my team has a group chat, and they message me if they’re sick or running late. This colleague also sent me a recent message of appreciation for my patience during this time which my wife saw.

Finished my meeting and my wife looking like at me like an angry bird accusing me of cheating. She said since I hurt her, she’ll hurt me and threw a family watch I inherited. My grandad gave me a Swiss watch before he died and means a lot to me (worth a lot too). If you gave me a billion for, I wouldn’t sell. My grandad saved 35+ years to buy it and he gave it to me. Instantly broke which hurt me very deeply. I then explained the purpose of the call with my colleague and showed her proof that buying everyone coffee befriend she believed me.

She instantly apologised and I didn’t get angry, but very upset. I feel all his efforts have gone to waste and I knew how much it meant to my grandad. Meant a lot to me too. I know it’s only a watch, but I watched him suffer and work hard for us his whole life. 

My wife has been apologising constantly and even offered to go back into work to buy me a new one. But for me it was priceless. Im upset she wanted to hurt me so much knowing how much it meant to me. Im hurt she didn’t even speak to me and the way she disrespected me. I also feel it was a very big overreaction.

We’ve been on ice for the last two weeks with her pleading for forgiveness. She asked for her best husband but I can’t fake talking to her. I’ve tried getting over it but can’t. We even took three days apart but it didn’t work. We don’t talk much anymore and most days ends with her crying. I’ve tried but she can see it on my face and eyes I’m not over it. We planned a date night last night which went horribly because on the way there she kept pestering if I’m okay. I’ve never snapped at her, but I told her to stop asking because she’s annoying me even more. We didn’t get to the restaurant as she burst down in tears even after I apologised.

When I put it into perspective, she only broke a watch but it means so much to me. There’s a lot of other context but I keep thinking I should’ve been over it by now. I love her, but can’t seem to forgive her. Not sure how we move forward because space hasn’t worked, not sure what will. I miss how we used to be, but this feels like a huge betrayal.",3,1738849532.0,MuslimMarriage,9,0.8,False

Im 23 years old and 35+1 weeks pregnant. So far ive gained 40lbs during pregnancy i was 160lbs now im pushing 200lbs. I eat fruit and veggies on a regular basis but i do partake in caffeine just one cup of coffee a day. I indulge in sweets, sugar and whatnot. But overall i think im pretty healthy with what i eat. I eat breakfast lunch and dinner.  And i drink about 5-6 bottles of water a day. I take prenatal vitamins etc. i got diagnosed with slight anemia so they prescribed me d12+iron supplements. But to be honest its hard to take 3 pills at three different time of day especially while im working and on weekends its even harder to keep track,so i gave up on taking the extra pills since its only slight anemia. Im always soooo exhausted so im not moving around a ton. But im not a couch potato either. Early in pregnancy i had really bad morning sickness but it got better with zofran, i weened myself off it and i dont take it anymore. Thats just the background so we can get the full picture. Ive messaged my doctor about feeling dizzy,sweaty,vision closing,hearing muffled,having trouble breathing, episodes… im not swelling. The first time it happened i was at church standing and i started to have a hard time breathing like there was a weight on my chest.. then my vision started closing and i was legit sweating bullets.. i was genuinely scared i started crying silently (uncontrollable please don’t judge) ive never ever had something like that happen to me. The second time i was at work sitting in a chair and the same thing happened. The third time i was cleaning up the house for my husband’s gma to come visit and i started to see stars and the same other symptoms.. so i sat down like i did for the past episodes and i felt good enough to get up and continue it came back almost immediately when i stood up. So i sat back down i repeated this cycle like five times. It was really bad on the last time so i gave up cleaning and laid down for a while and after that i was fine eventually… i talked to my ob the first time and they said “panic attacks” never had one before so i just took their word for it? Second time i felt that it wasnt a panic attack.. and they dismissed me again… this third time i know its not a panic attack because it kept coming back? Nothing makes sense they told me to wear compression socks.. im like not spending money on compression socks im not swelling? Does anybody have any clue what this is? 

Also: i have a hard time breathing in general some times but it doesnt progress to an episode on occasion which is what just happened to me thats why im making this also sometimes i feel nauseous.",3,1738849259.0,pregnant,15,1.0,False

I have a patient who is disabled after a stroke at a young age and his wife is the best. She is such a good advocate and teaches the staff so much about their needs and resources. After being inpatient for almost a year, he was able to go home!!! Recently, he had some issues and was in and out of hospital; she was really struggling with that and having babies to care for as well. she told me her self care was a bath, a fountain Diet Coke or a starbucks drink and I wish we could just give that to her for the rest of her life. Can we just put together a basket of gift card and Epsom salt and give it to her as an anonymous gift (my anal co worker said it has to be anonymous)?

 Silent Ægir

Chapter 1

The aging outpost

Janus floated, weightless, again. His sense of self… distant. A vast open void filled him with dread. A jolt. The dream lingered, unraveling at the edges as he whispered: ""o-six thirty-two. Bed. Ceiling. Body."" - Anchoring himself. No sweat this time. Good.

As he slowly woke, reality seeped into his eyes, and he could feel his muscles relax. It had been some time since his last nightmare. ""*Shit, Venn’s gonna have a field day with that one""* \- He thought as he calmed his breathing. A sliver of muted rust-colored sky painted the room in warm light, while shadows cast by small potted plants and a small bookshelf starkly contrasted the environment outside. Janus left his window uncovered, despite the occasional feeling of being watched at night. As his eyes adjusted, he noticed one red and one amber warning light above his bedroom door. “*Shit,* *condition one* ***and*** *condition two? Better rise and shine”,* he thought.

He forcefully tapped his wristwatch three times as he groggily rose from his warm bed, feeling the cool air brush against his feet. His breathing slowed as he walked to his kitchen, his sore muscles stiffening his movements. He settled onto the stool closest to the window. The sleek espresso machine, triggered by the three taps, hissed, then hummed. The bitter aroma of coffee filled the crisp, unfiltered morning air. From his high vantage point, looking out over the vast snow plains of Ægir, surrounded by stubby forests of pine-like trees casting long shadows across the snow, he could see the white-capped ocean, partially obscured by a large, snow-covered, jagged mountain. “Good morning Janus, did you sleep well?” a female voice emanating seemingly out of nowhere said.

""As if you don’t know already, jerk.” Janus said with a smile. “Also, Venn, what’s the weather like today?"" He said despite his innate understanding of this planet’s climate. ""Today’s a bit extra chilly, about negative thirty-one degrees celsius, with wind to boot, eighteen meters per second, gusting to twenty-three meters per second from the south."" Venn replied. ""Haha, that’s shrinkage cold!"" Janus said. ""I’m glad I’m not a sack of meat like you, dodged a bullet for sure! Also the replacement environment suit is still not finished so you can’t stay out for too long in just your backup gear, although there’s a calmer weather system developing, which will arrive by the evening."" Venn’s soft voice had some playfulness. “Damn it, Venn. What’s the holdup? Wait—belay that. Coffee first."" ""Sure, Janus. You do know the 3D printer progress bar can be accessed from literally every screen, right? There’s nothing wrong with the printers."" Janus chuckled, gripping his cup a bit too tight, almost scalding his hand. “Yeah, I know Venn, I’m a little on edge this morning, that’s all. The suit design was particularly intricate this time. Sorry”. “No worries Janus, but you know we have to talk about your nightmare? You’re at a mental condition two fault state you know.” “Yes, but we can do that later, Venn, I’m not at condition 1 yet. And stop calling it ‘fault state’, you’re the machine, not I!” Janus said dryly as the slight feeling of unease made a brief comeback as a pit in his stomach. “Oof, that hurts right here, in my mechanical heart, you’re mean!” “Again, jerk!” He replied, throwing his hands in the air, the pit in his stomach less noticeable now. 

A particularly strong gust of wind whipped up snow outside the window, briefly obscuring the view of the rising star, Epsilon Eridani, dimming the deceivingly warm light filling the kitchen area.

“Any messages from home yet?” “No, Janus, it’s been very quiet. I queried all the relay stations at regular intervals as soon as we faced them.” “Okay… this is nominal, for now.”

As Janus inhaled the exquisite aroma of the carefully crafted cup of coffee, he contemplated today’s agenda; The rover had broken down, making long excursions impossible, and the 3D printer was occupied due to a major overhaul of the environment suit, so the production of spare parts had been delayed even more. The manifest of today’s resupply drop was vague and probably falsified, so he could not count on that they had sent the correct parts. The new warning lights were just another brick in the wall, he thought. His jaw muscles tightened as he adjusted his position on the stool, thinking of the anomalous sensor readings from Outpost 11. No matter, he was stuck at the outpost for now. Glancing out the window, he remembered the days he enjoyed feeling the raw power of the wind, the way it made him feel fragile yet in control. He hoped he could revisit that part of himself today.

After finishing his prescribed breakfast—Venn insisted on calling it that—Janus moved to the wardrobe as the lights adjusted to his presence. As he put on his woollen mesh undergarments, he longed for the sweet, short summer months of mild temperatures, long days, and the way that it made everything easier. Shivering in anticipation of the coming cold, he spoke to Venn;“Remind me, what’s on today’s agenda? I saw the warning lights.” “I’ve thought some more about our discussion about the water filters last night and they definitely need cleaning, our observation report on the star’s fluctuating brightness pattern is due in 2 days, so you’ll need to review that, and believe it or not, some bolts on the communications mast needs to be torqued to spec, which is unusual.” “Just as I feared, and the bolts being loose is weird. Also the star has been unusually quiet this report cycle.” He said absent mindedly as he could feel his gut tighten.After donning the rest of his backup cold weather gear, being careful to cover any exposed skin, he contemplated the cause of these anomalies—there had been a few lately— as he walked through the ‘airlock.’ 

This wasn’t a true vacuum-sealed chamber, but rather an architectural design choice to conserve energy and protect the indoor environment by limiting the intrusion of the harsh exterior elements. As the interior door sealed shut with a soft thud, he began to hum—the same melody as always. It was a habit now, the tune lasting just long enough to fill the pause before the outer door unlocked and opened.“Yep, it’s one of **those** days…” Janus muttered as snow started filling the air in the room he was standing. He stepped outside to a familiar, alien world bathed in the orange morning light. A chill permeated his entire body, he had forgotten to tighten his jacket. As he did, he looked towards the east and he was yet again gripped by the stark beauty of Ægir’s harsh landscape. During a slight lull in wind, he inhaled the pristine air. “I never get tired of that view, Venn”, he whispered to his only companion in the entire world. As he leaned against the wind, Venn answered in his helmet headset “It really is something isn’t it?” “Mhm, we’re the only ones able to appreciate this”.

“What is the size and torque specs for the bolts?” he said as he approached the outside tool storage unit. “**30 millimeters, 2410 Newton meters**. There’s 12 of them.” “What!? The main bolts are loose?! Why didn’t you tell me earlier, especially with this wind?” “I’m sorry Janus, but there are 128 in total. 9.375%  of the bolts are loose, which is below the threshold of 10% for a condition 1 fault, so I saw no need to rush you.” “Venn, that’s a condition 1 waiting to happen”Slightly frustrated  by Venns behaviour and himself for his lapse in curiosity, he grabbed the bulky hydraulic torque multiplier backpack from the outside storage unit. The tool had a worn, rugged and well-thought out appearance, with a compact display for showing diagnostics to the operator. He made his way towards the communications tower on the hard, wind-sculpted sastrugi-covered snow field. Every step emitting a loud hollow creaking noise, punctuating the frigid conditions. He chose to walk the small hill to stave off the cold despite the near condition 1 [fault. As](http://fault.As) he approached the base of the tower, his breathing was heavy, misting in the frigid air. Despite being careful not to sweat, he could feel perspiration starting to manifest, a deadly sin in these conditions. His goggles indicated where the loose bolts were located. Buffeted by the wind, feeling its pressure against his back, he worked efficiently, dismounting the torque wrench and preparing it for use. The melodic howling of the wind across the communications mast had a calming effect on Janus. “*They really have thought of everything, too bad nothing lasts forever.”* he thought as he applied the tool to the first bolt, quickly drowning out all other noise with rapid clacking.Drawing laboured breaths, Janus methodically took to the task at hand, double checking and documenting each bolt with the wrench’s user interface, before moving onto the next. Despite the meditative qualities of this work, he was unable to control his thoughts sufficiently to hold back the gnawing feeling of wrongness of these anomalies, leaving him distracted.“Venn, are there any more bolts that indicate that they might come loose?” “Actually there are,” Venn replied as four new icons faded into view. “They’re not very loose, but I see why you might want to remedy that since you’re already up here.” “Thanks.” Janus said as a powerful gust of wind nearly knocked him over and brought a fresh blast of drift snow up, making him grab for handholds. “When did you first notice the bolts coming loose? How did it progress?” Janus asked loudly over the flapping of his garments.. “First indication of loosening was 04:21 this night, all bolts became loose at the same time, the four bolts you’re tightening now have been loose since last friday, but they only reduced their clamping force by 5%.” Rubbing his shoulders and taking a deep breath he replied “Okay. Simultaneous loosening of 12 bolts?  That’s probably the wind, right?” Venn replied as he shifted to the next bolt. “Yes, that’s my assessment as well, it coincides with a strong wind gust, and after some modelling and looking at the slight stretch of the bolts, it basically confirms that it was the wind.” “Haha, just the wind, and long bolts that will need replacing.” Janus laughed without any humor as he shivered.

Static work, exposed to those conditions, was far from comfortable. Shivering, he did a quick brush off on any loose snow that had settled onto the wrench and packed it up into its carrying backpack. Being careful to not trip, he rushed down the small hill, rhythmic, hollow creaking accompanying his every footfall. “*Hot damn, that environmental suit cannot be finished quickly enough.”*  he thought as his brain was jostled by the sharp impacts on the hard snow.Halfway down the hill, warmth seeped back into his fingertips and toes—a welcome but brief relief, as running downhill didn’t produce nearly as much heat as walking uphill.

The jostling weight of the equipment pack pressed against his lower back, each sharp impact rippling tension through his body. His breath hitched. Fingers clenched around the straps, his vision narrowed, the hollow feeling was creeping in again—familiar, unwelcome. He slowed his pace and started to deliberately draw deep breaths in an effort to stave off a panic attack. 

“It’s happening again, Venn.” “I can see that.” Venn replied. “Good, keep doing that, deep breaths, just like we practiced… I have a bit of good news! The resupply drop is on schedule, I’m expecting it to enter the atmosphere around 19:30 this evening, we’ll be in for quite the show, and Outpost 11 has started reporting normal readings intermittently.” “Thank you.” he replied tersely. 

Feeling for the sensation of his body, the position of his limbs, the coldness of his toes, Janus managed to settle his churning [mind. As](http://mind.As) the habitat came into view again, the observation dome on the rood gleaming in the star light,  he had completely regained his faculties but the feeling of walking at the edge was still very much present *“Fuck, this is getting ridiculus.*” He thought. “Venn, about the nightmares, I think we need to treat me as having a condition 1 fault.” He almost yelled due to the powerful wind flapping his garments. “Well no shi. - ehm I mean good! How about we talk at dinner?” Venn replied with a large dose of humour. Janus felt his mood lighten significantly at the unexpected retort. “Yeah, sure, it isn’t exactly like I’m having a date.” Walking up the windswept ramp to the storage unit, he had to fight the wind as he gritted his teeth. Opening the heavy door, the years of hydraulic oil, solvents and heavy industry so different to pristine outside air came rushing at him. Walking up to the exterior door he looked up at the inconspicuous and faded text to the left of the door, ‘Outpost 8’. He entered the airlock, the outer door making a satisfying thud-click sound as it closed. As it did, his world plunged into darkness.

Chapter 2

Outliar

Placing his outdoor gear at their designated places, warmth returned quickly. Seeing Janus’ discomfort, Venn had raised the interior temperature to a balmy 30 degrees celsius in anticipation of his arrival back at the outpost. The small modular fusion reactor, capable of providing nearly a gigawatt of power, and abundance of local tritium fuel made energy management a non issue. Looking at one of the many screens, he checked the printing progress on the environment suit;

**‘Atomic scale printing unit 3**

**Current matter deposition rate: 4.3 x 10\^22 atoms/second**

**Current dynamic matter stream: Xenon-Phase 3a**

**Current time: 09:45.** **EnvSuit\_mk4 progress: 78%, 12 hours, 29 minutes remaining’** 

*As the tightly controlled magnetic field steered the ionized matter stream across the vacuum chamber, collated by carefully manipulated nozzles, the printer placed each atom at their predetermined coordinates, velocity carefully controlled to minimize splatter effects.* *Some atoms splatter though, depositing junk at the nozzles and ablating the interior chamber and equipment.* **“Still not fast enough.”** He thought.

He rubbed his hands together, feeling the friction and letting the warmth sink into his skin. He didn’t mind waiting, but waiting reminded him too much of his childhood - all the hours spent in waiting rooms and under observation, waiting for someone to decide what he was. Janus knew that these thoughts were destructive, he had spent years fortifying his mind against them, but recent events had eroded these defences like the wind on Ægir does to exposed rock. Pondering on the unnatural abundance of the naturally occurring tritium, Janus’ mind started to wander.

The tests, inquiries, probes… - Were they really necessary? And what gave them the right to go that far? Was he the only one they did that to?

Reaching for the shower faucet and turning it on gave a momentary shock to the senses as cold water rushed over Janus’ form. Taking deep, calming breaths he felt the warmth eventually spread. The water pressure was low, - shit the filters needed cleaning. Having never liked hot showers, he reflected upon his choice to go on this mission, was he really the best candidate? It seemed predetermined even though he felt less than qualified. But in the face of empirical evidence, Janus had to concede that he was, in fact, the best candidate. He aced every test, quiz, trial and medical examination. Most importantly he was especially adept on what was arguably the most important trait for this mission - his ability to function under prolonged isolation and pressure. And after all, what more evidence did he want? He was here, wasn’t he? They had chosen him.

Standing there, soaking up the heat and moisture, he began to hum his trusted old melody as a way of counting down before he had to get out of the shower. “Venn, can you update me on the orbital parameters of the resupply vehicle? Is it still on course?” Janus asked with a sense of unease “Sure, velocity at **11.2 kilometers per second**, perigee holding at **60 kilometers**, inclination stable at **32.5 degrees**—entry angle within margin. High level winds within limits. It’s on track.” “Thanks,” Janus said as he exited the shower, the colder air of the bathroom chilling his body. He didn’t really need the information dump, and there would be nothing he could do to affect the outcome of the ballistic vehicle anyways.

Like most of the rooms at Outpost 8, the bathroom had a floor to ceiling window, a deliberate design choice, not out of opulence, but to fit Janus' psychological profile. His mission, **the mission**, was built on hope, a collective wish that had consumed the resources of nations. So yes, let the man have his vistas.

Walking towards the drying chamber, looking out over the late morning star lit landscape, squinting, a slight visual distortion appeared above him as the holographic ceiling activated.  The anticipated trace of the resupply vehicle faded into view. “*Hmm, uncanny, Venn.”* Entering the chamber, a sudden and familiar blast of hot air rushed downward for a few seconds as the chamber activated its powerful heaters and fans. The slight smell of ozone filled his olfactory awareness, briefly transporting him back to the drive test chambers back home. 

Outside, the wind had subsided somewhat, and snow had stopped drifting. An icicle on an overhang beside the window began dripping slowly. Observing this, Janus felt a faint rush. Was it excitement, dread? Lacking a clear mind, he took a deep, shivering breath and spoke to Venn, “You feel that, too?” “Yes, Janus, I feel it. Do you want to address it now or at dinner?” Furrowing his brow, Janus ruminated. He still had chores, but so far these have not been a good enough distraction to deter his negative spiral. He looked into the mirror, seeing a weary, chiseled face stare back at him. “*So this is what it’s come to, I’m really at condition 1? Fuck it!”*

“You know what? Just clear the rest of today’s activities. I think I need to rest, maybe play some games.” “Well okay Janus, but you didn’t answer my question.” “Yes. Yes, I'll share  my feelings with you using my mouth as well.” Janus forced a slight laugh as he put on his bathrobe, and tapped his wrist watch three times. Captivated by the view from his bathroom, he listened to the espresso machine starting its process to deliver the carefully crafted bean brew, further depleting the dwindling coffee reserves.

Dried off and warm, Janus settled on the comfortable couch in the living room and put the coffee cup on the wooden table, making a soft clunk. The space had been carefully and exquisitely decorated, with walls and ceiling proportioned just so to frame the outside view. The muted, warm colors emphasized the architects' efforts to make the outposts welcoming. Sipping his coffee, he brought up the path for the resupply vehicle. The ceiling became transparent, revealing the wispy clouds of the desolate world. *“Nine hours to arrival..”* He whispered to himself. The icon tracking the resupply vehicle had a descriptive text - 

**‘Demeter 6** 

**Relative velocity: 11.5km/s,** 

**Mass: 129,923kg**

**Distance: 362,620km’**

**Calculated landing site: 32.529N 14.183E**

Tracking the dotted yellow line, Janus identified the landing site to be just by the edge of the sparse, untouched forest, about 6 kilometres distant. ‘’- *Hmm, too far to haul most of the goods myself, I’ll just go and grab the coffee beans and any spare parts I might find, weather allowing.’’* His coffee was luke warm now, most of the heat had soaked into his hands. Swiping his right index finger, he brought up a live image of the hemisphere he was on, streamed down from the geostationary weather satellite. A slight hand wiggle brought up a weather forecast for the next three days. “- *Fair weather tomorrow, good.”* He thought. 

A soft clunk, slightly more hollow now, sounded as he set his empty cup back onto the table. Raising his hand, he made a fist, closing the information.

Feeling the soft couch with his hand, he leaned back, breathed and closed his eyes. “Venn, up for a little war?”  “Nah, this personal assistant isn’t available for games.” “Well okay then. Stop trying to cheer me up, I’m dealing with some shit” Janus chuckled in reply, eyes still closed. “I wasn’t aware I was trying to cheer you up! - Sure Janus, go get the cards.”

“Venn, you’re cheating, using your mind games to make me shuffle the cards in your favor.” “You know better than most how randomness works, and besides, cheating isn’t in my nature.” “Losing seven times in a row is highly improbable, this is a game of chance, you’re cheating.” “Okay Sherlock, you’ve got me. I might have switched out some cards when you were gone.” Taken a bit aback, Janus shifted slightly on the couch. “Wait-what? You actually cheated?” He asked. “I am sorry to have cheated. But since your mental state is as it is, at condition 1 and all, I took the opportunity to test your level of cognitive degradation, and you passed. You have not lost it completely!” Janus exhaled and relaxed his hands on his head. “Just as protocol dictates…But with cards? Nice touch!” He let out a small chuckle. “Well, it’s nice to be reminded that you’re here for me.” Venn didn’t reply right away. Janus settled further into the couch pillows. He listened to the subdued hum, the ever present sound of ventilation.

The conversations with Venn meandered between a wide range of topics. Eventually he became restless. “I think I need to stretch my legs a bit.” Janus said as he adjusted his center of gravity, stood up from the couch and walked into the hallway, taking a left half way. “How long ‘till the environment suit is done now?” “8 hours and 44 minutes, you won’t miss the entry of Demeter 6.” The stairs going up, made from subtly flowing birch wood, lightly colored and smelling of home, took him into the observation dome of Outpost 8. Providing a three hundred and sixty degree view, the interior of the dome was brilliantly lit by the afternoon star and light reflected by the snow from the hill above.

One half of the dome had walls reaching partway up from the floor. Mounted to that wall a wide desk made from the same, richly textured birch wood as the stairs, held up several physical, old school monitors, a keyboard and a mouse. The dome, constructed from a non-reflective material with a refractive index matching Ægir's air, offered an absolutely clear, unobstructed view of the outside world. As Janus approached the desk, his footsteps reverberated slightly from the curved dome. The monitors activated, displaying various sensor readings, in small efficient user interface windows. “Local sensor readings look fine, Venn, but why are there network faults for outposts three, seven and twenty five?” “Unsure, there’s no abnormal ion activity that would indicate any disruptions in radio comms. Could be a software bug—maybe the outpost network nodes aren’t handling packets correctly.” Venn’s usually playful lilt a bit more subdued now. Janus drew in a sharp breath. “Well, I promised myself I’d relax for the rest of the day.” Stretching and swinging his arms, he tried to ignore the tension he felt building up, he pivoted around and walked towards the darkly colored, low profile treadmill facing the view outside. “Ten kph please.” He said as he stepped onto the hard, rubber-like membrane. A slight hum, amplified by the dome, was quickly drowned out by the rhythmic thumping of Janus’s running. Jaws still tight, he felt the monitor's presence behind him, taunting him to come look again. He increased his pace, the sensation of breathing occupying more of his mind, his physical exertion acting as a shield. Further upping the tempo, his lungs screaming for air, he kept pushing. Running flat out now, his heart thumped, blood rushed throughout his body filling his ears, he thought he could hear Venn’s voice. Too out of breath to speak, Janus shakily stepped off the treadmill and fell into a heap on the floor. After some time had elapsed, twenty seconds? A minute? - he spoke to Venn, still out of breath.

“Did you say something?” “No, Janus, I didn’t.” Venn answered. “I really thought I heard you say something… - Well so much for that shower, be glad you can’t smell.” “You know I can smell, Janus, I have sensors everywhere, you wouldn’t believe the things you smell of.”

...and that's my current progress. Note: ""Venn"" means friend in Norwegian, my native language.

1ij2oil,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ij2oil,Not a bad anti supermarket haul.,"So this month I am avoiding the supermarket as best I can and supporting my local stores which I don't do as often as I'd like! I live in a shopping district in a small cheese making town in the Netherlands and everything is in walking distance.
 
I got coffee from the nut roaster (€12.50) and cheese from our amazing cheesemonger (€10.95). There are also wonderful bakeries for bread and pastries, a butcher, a fishmonger, a windmill to buy flour and a fruit and veg shop which is always well stocked. There is also a market in the square on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

The biggest surprise was a shop my friend recommended when I asked her where to get milk. It's self automated so I downloaded an app to open the door and pay for what I took. I got the milk (local from the dairy in town), some mandarins cos they looked good (they were!) and some stuff for pizza, not local but organic and from Italy (€9.33). 

It is working out to be pricier but I find I'm buying way fewer impulse purchases and it all tastes so much better. I also get to walk more which is a pain in the butt but also a good thing. And I get to support local. 

It's day 6 and I honestly think I will never need to use big super ever again - except maybe for cleaning supplies and cat litter.

In the heart of a bustling world, where skyscrapers scrape the heavens and dreams collide with deadlines, a new dawn arises. The rise of remote work opportunities is nothing short of a revolution—a movement so profound that it reshapes not just the way we work, but the very essence of our lives. It’s a call to arms, beckoning each of us to seize the reins of our destinies.

Imagine waking up to the gentle sun filtering through your window, escaping the cold grip of the traditional 9-to-5 grind. Picture a life where your office isn’t a cubicle, but a sunlit corner of your home, a coffee shop buzzing with creativity, or even a beach where the waves sing your name. This is not just a fantasy; it’s the reality of remote work—a gateway that opens doors to unparalleled flexibility, empowering us to live on our own terms.

The truth is, the pandemic was the catalyst for a seismic shift. A once-in-a-lifetime event that forced us to rethink everything we knew about work. We were cast into an abyss of uncertainty, yet amidst the chaos, a new path illuminated before us. Companies recognized not only the viability of remote work but the power of trust. They’ve seen productivity rise as employees step into their environments, and with that, the chains of a rigid schedule began to crumble.

But this is not merely about a change in location; it’s about reclaiming our time. Each moment is precious, a gift to be cherished. Remote work unveils a profound truth: we are not machines. We are artists of our own lives! The flexibility it offers allows us to nurture our passions, pursue our interests, and engage with our loved ones like never before. It’s a rebirth—a chance to align our work with our values, to design our daily routines around what truly matters.

Here’s the call to action: Embrace this opportunity! The job market is replete with possibilities waiting to be unlocked. Websites like Remote.co, We Work Remotely, and FlexJobs burst onto the scene, offering platforms where talent meets opportunity—where the world is your oyster. But do not just scroll idly; take the leap! Polish your resume, hone your skills, pitch your passion, and put yourself out there. The brave get ahead.

Moreover, let’s talk about the deep, spiritual layer of this transformation. This is not just about working from home; it’s about finding balance, reestablishing connections, and discovering what fulfillment truly means. It’s a communion with our purpose, an alignment of body, mind, and spirit. Tap into this. Ask yourself: What stirs my soul? What legacy am I building? The answers will guide you to jobs that resonate with your core, igniting a fire that no office wall can contain.

Yet, amidst this evolution lies a warning: tread wisely. The charm of remote work can blur boundaries—work can seep into every corner of your life like an unwelcome guest. Create rituals, set boundaries, and carve out sacred spaces for rest and reflection. This is your sanctuary, your battleground for peace, and it deserves attention.

Rise up! The era of remote work isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a paradigm shift that summons the adventurers, the creators, the rebels. Whether you’re seeking the freedom to travel, the ability to be present for your family, or just the thrill of crafting your own schedule, now is the time to act.

Let’s not merely adapt; let’s thrive! Let’s turn the mundane into the magnificent. Network with intention, learn tirelessly, and step boldly into this brave new world. The universe rewards those who dare to venture. With each application sent, each connection made, remember: you’re not just looking for a job; you’re crafting a life—your life.

So, breathe deeply. Feel the adrenaline rush of possibility surging through your veins. The tools for your transformation are here. Will you grasp them? The power is within you! Unlock the freedom, embrace the flexibility, and let your spirit soar as the horizons stretch before you.

I'm losing the last fifteen pounds from a weight gain after moving from Europe to America. I must say... I tried doing keto, low fat-high carb, and intermittent fasting-- but what works for me is only eating twice a day. I've realized that I actually don't need to eat nearly as much as I was eating before. (I loved low-carb snacks, but they brought up my calories quite a bit!) 

Essentially, I realized that I was doing keto wrong; I was exceeding my calorie count although I was eating limited carbs, and I was eating too much fat. Now, I still base my meals around protein, but my dietary habits just feel more intuitive than before. I still do intermittent fasting; I stop eating at 7 pm and I don't eat until 12 pm the next morning. This encourages me to stay hydrated, too; mornings are for tea, coffee, and water only :)

Its weird because it kinda feels personal when she doesn’t like the things i love but then it actually kinda helps me disconnect to her a bit in a healthy way, like she isn’t trying to replicate me if that makes sense! its super strange but if she loved all the stuff i loved its kinda just a little me bird but its cute how she likes what she likes and we have that difference. still pretty tough tho lol!",3,1738848092.0,finch,2,1.0,False

*With twenties' laughter peaking over hats,*

*A bride in white beside her groom in slacks,*

*Across the window, near the bedside sat.*

 

*The daises fresh were kept in vase at first,*

*But peaceful days were lost to tiny hands,*

*By second year, the days were spent in jest,*

*The tiny terror tracking trails of sand!*

 

*As days passed candles longer stayed at nights,*

*As lady kept her vigil over food,*

*So, she and he could catch the starry sights,*

*But not before the child was tucked in bed.*

 

*The lady bakes her man's beloved bread,*

*With sweetest, crunchy crust and spicy smell.*

*Just after kissing lady, out he fled,*

*With coffee aftertaste from morning bell.*

 

*The son is playing throw and catch with dad,*

*While heaving ball no farther than four rolls.*

*With strut triumphant, holding spam in hand,*

*Declares that she had saved five cents in sale.*

 

*The husband washing dishes after meal,*

*While heart of hearts with needle, mends the rips,*

*In summer rains, he repairs the roof-seal.*

*They both in winter enjoy skinny dips.*

 

*The child has fever burning one o' two,*

*The mother cried before the lord and kneeled,*

*The father threatened doctor that he'd sue,*

*To cure his son whatever bill it reeled.*

 

*The boy is charged and spanked for potty mouth,*

*The boy had grown three-fifths a quarterstaff!*

*The boy then moved away to room in south,*

*As bed no longer fits their two and half.*

 

*The family sets out for Sunday church,*

*In tight and formal dress with sulky teen.*

*And after sermon stop for early brunch,*

*Then homeward bound for chores yet unseen.*

 

*As dandelion the boy has flown afar!*

*The lady knits as Christmas drifts away.*

*The lord of house has lost the balding war!*

*She hides from mirrors showing white and gray.*

 

*Awaiting granddaughter’s letters every morn,*

*And taking longer walks along the lake.*

*While holding me to breast, they softly warn,*

*That only death together may them take.*

 

*Then moved away from lovely bedside stand,*

*And packed inside the cardboard box with rest,*

*In shadowed attic I was left to guard,*

*The tales of dad and mom were laid to rest.*

With every meal shared, every cup of coffee, every grocery run 

my sense of belonging returns unscathed


Every quiet evening, every slow morning, every daydream of a better future 


Every week, every month, every season 

signals one more block freed from the great and terrible retaining wall in my chest

--------------------------------------------------------

Moving into a new home is an exciting adventure, especially when it comes to setting up your kitchen. The kitchen is often the heart of the home, where meals are made, and memories are created. To ensure you have a successful start, here are essential kitchen tools that every new homeowner should have.

### Knives

Having a good set of knives is crucial for meal prep. A sharp chef's knife, a paring knife, and a serrated bread knife should be staples in your kitchen. These tools will greatly enhance your cooking experience, making it easier to chop, slice, and dice.

### Cutting Board

Along with your knives, a sturdy cutting board is a must-have. Opt for a wooden or plastic board that is easy to clean and won’t dull your knives. Consider having separate boards for meat and vegetables to prevent cross-contamination.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
### Measuring Tools

Accuracy in cooking can make all the difference. Invest in measuring cups and spoons that come in both liquid and dry varieties. A kitchen scale is also helpful, especially when baking, as it ensures precision in your ingredients.

### Pots and Pans

Quality cookware is vital. A set of pots and pans that includes a frying pan, a saucepan, and a larger stockpot will cover most of your cooking needs. Look for non-stick options for easy clean-up, or go for stainless steel for better heat distribution.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
### Mixing Bowls

Mixing bowls are necessary for preparing recipes, whether you're tossing a salad or mixing dough. Having a set that includes various sizes will be beneficial. Glass or stainless steel bowls are excellent choices because they are durable and can often be used in the microwave.

### Appliances

While your kitchen might have built-in appliances, there are a few stand-alone options that can enhance your cooking experience:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
- **Blender:** Perfect for smoothies, soups, and sauces.
- **Toaster or Toaster Oven:** For quick breakfasts and snacks.
- **Coffee Maker:** A must-have for coffee lovers.
- **Slow Cooker or Instant Pot:** These appliances simplify meal preparation, allowing you to come home to delicious meals.

### Utensils

Don't forget the cooking utensils! A good set should include a spatula, a ladle, tongs, and a whisk. Silicone or wooden utensils are great options as they do not scratch your cookware. Be sure to have a can opener and a peeler handy as well.

### Dishes and Glassware

Practical dishware is vital when entertaining guests or enjoying meals with family. Choose a set of plates, bowls, and glasses that fit your style. Mix and match is a nice approach if you enjoy a more eclectic look!

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
### Kitchen Linens

Kitchen towels and oven mitts are essential for safety and cleanliness. Choose absorbent towels for drying dishes and cleaning up spills. Oven mitts are necessary to handle hot pots and pans safely.

### Storage Solutions

Having proper storage solutions helps keep your kitchen organized. Invest in some clear containers for pantry staples like flour and sugar. Drawer organizers can keep your utensils tidy, while baskets can hold produce or small kitchen gadgets.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
As a new homeowner, having the right kitchen tools will make cooking enjoyable and efficient. Building your kitchen toolkit with quality items will set you up for countless delicious meals and joyful experiences in your new home. Remember, every item in your kitchen should support your cooking style and make it easier for you to create great food!

Transforming Your New Home Owner Kitchen: Tips for Personalization and Style
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving into your new home is an exciting adventure, especially when it comes to designing your new home owner kitchen. This is the heart of your home, where meals are prepared, and memories are created. Personalizing your kitchen can make it feel welcoming and unique. Here are some tips to help you transform your space into a stylish and functional kitchen.

### Start with a Color Palette

Choosing a color palette is an essential first step in personalizing your kitchen. The right colors can set the tone for the entire space. Here are some options you might consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
- **Bright and Vibrant:** Colors like yellow or turquoise can make the kitchen feel lively and energetic.
- **Calming Neutrals:** Shades of grey, beige, or white are soothing and can create a clean, modern look.
- **Bold Accents:** Use bold colors on a single wall or in decor items to add excitement without overwhelming the space.

When selecting your colors, think about how they match your personal style and the overall vibe of your house.

### Incorporate Personal Touches

Your kitchen should reflect who you are. Here are some ways to add personal touches:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
- **Artwork:** Hang some of your favorite pieces or DIY art projects. This can make the space feel more like you.
- **Family Photos:** Display pictures of loved ones or memorable moments on shelves or the fridge. They can bring a smile as you cook.
- **Unique Decor:** Find kitchen decor items like quirky salt and pepper shakers or vintage signs that resonate with your personality.

### Functional Layouts

When designing your new home owner kitchen, functionality is key. An effective layout can make cooking a joy rather than a chore. Consider the following:

- **Work Triangle:** An efficient kitchen layout should create a triangle between the sink, stove, and refrigerator. This design minimizes the distance you need to walk when preparing meals.
- **Open Shelving:** If you prefer easy access to your cookware and dishware, open shelves can be a stylish and functional addition.
- **Island Addition:** If space allows, adding a kitchen island can provide additional workspace, seating, or storage.

Plan your kitchen layout based on how you cook and entertain. This will make your kitchen inviting and practical.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
### Accessorize Smartly

The right accessories can elevate your kitchen style. Choose items that blend practicality with aesthetics:

- **Colorful Appliances:** Invest in vibrant kitchen appliances. They can serve as functional pieces and art at the same time.
- **Textiles:** Use patterned dish towels, unique table runners, or decorative table mats to add color and texture.
- **Lighting:** Make a statement with pendant lights or under-cabinet lighting. Proper lighting can transform the mood of your kitchen.

### Embrace Smart Storage Solutions

In a new kitchen, it's important to keep things organized. Smart storage solutions can help you stay tidy while adding style:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
- **Drawer Organizers:** Use dividers in drawers to keep utensils, tools, and gadgets neatly sorted.
- **Stackable Containers:** They save space and keep food items fresh and visible.
- **Pantry Labels:** Customize your pantry with labels for both style and easy access.

Implementing these storage ideas can make your kitchen more functional and stylish.

### Get Creative with Backsplash

The backsplash is not just functional; it's an opportunity to express your style. Consider these ideas:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
- **Tile Patterns:** Use colorful ceramic tiles or unique shapes to create a visual focal point.
- **Painted Backsplash:** A painted wall behind the counter can be an inexpensive way to add color.
- **Mirror Finish:** Using mirrored tiles can make your kitchen look larger and brighter.

Let your creativity shine through in this often-overlooked space!

Transforming your new home owner kitchen is an exciting journey. By incorporating your personality, embracing functionality, and adding stylish touches, you can create a space that feels uniquely yours. Enjoy the process of making this essential room a true reflection of your style and comfort!

### Conclusion

As you embrace your journey as a new homeowner, creating a kitchen that reflects your personality and meets your cooking needs is essential. By equipping yourself with the essential kitchen tools, you lay the groundwork for culinary success and efficiency. Items like quality knives, sturdy cutting boards, and versatile cookware are fundamental for daily meal prep. They not only enhance your efficiency in the kitchen but also inspire creativity while you cook.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/new-home-owner-kitchen  
  
Personalization is where the magic truly happens. Transforming your new homeowner kitchen into a space that feels uniquely yours goes beyond just functionality. Consider adding decorative elements, like vibrant dishware or artwork, to infuse warmth and character into the room. Playing with colors, textures, and even lighting can significantly impact the atmosphere, making it a welcoming space for family and friends.

Remember, your kitchen is not just about cooking; it’s a gathering place where memories are made. Invite personal touches, whether it’s through family heirlooms or travel-inspired decor, to cultivate a sense of belonging. Always prioritize comfort and functionality, as a well-designed kitchen should cater to your lifestyle.

1ij1zsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OptimistsUnite/comments/1ij1zsn/what_can_be_done/,What Can Be Done,"Disclaimer: This message is for Americans. Before proceeding, let us be clear:

An American is a member of the UNITED States of America.

If any one political party or human being means more to you than being an American, you do not understand America: in other words, this information is not for you.

If you are unwilling to learn new information, process change, or critically think, you fundamentally do not understand the role of being an American: in other words, this information is not for you.

If you place money above country, you have abandoned the primary principle of America; this information is not for you.

If you are unable to look beyond yourself, or today, in service of your country and its ongoing prosperity, this information is not for you.

If you are proud of this country, proud of its history, and are willing to fight to make it better, this information is for you.

If you understand that this country was founded upon the power of the people, this information is for you. Let us be clear, again: this country does not rely on the power of corporations or money. People, our brothers and sisters, have the power.

If you understand that trust and unity are the foundational parts of every single greatest time period in American history, and every single one of our greatest national accomplishments, this information is for you.


Be clear where you stand with the above. Perhaps this is not the right time for you to read what follows. You will know when it is.


The following days, months, and years, as they always have and always will, will determine the nation and world our children, and their children, live in. No corporation, no political party, no single American has a unique claim to our future interest. Our children all have a claim and a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

America is in crisis. There is no debate, there is no uncertainty here. Crisis.

Our children are less happy than they have ever been. Read it, again. Our children are less happy than they have ever been. And importantly, but slightly less important: other Americans are also less happy than they have ever been. [Home | The World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/)

Why? There is no great mystery. We are disconnected. We are more divided, less unified, than we have ever been. We interact with our friends less, we trust our neighbors less. We bury our faces, our minds, our attention in “social media.” We have been gleefully enslaved by the promise of electronic “connection.” The irony: social media has killed socializing. Our teenagers sit on their phones for hours a day. Our seniors and millennials do as well. And we know it. We know all of it.

So then we just stop. Right? We just stop. Until we acknowledge that the world’s richest corporations, paying top dollar for the algorithms that lock our dopamine-drive death spirals most quickly, have one purpose: profit. When the five-year old at the diner is sitting on an iPad and tapping the birds as his parents scroll, like, heart, upvote, money and profit are hardwiring his brain chemistry. He doesn’t know the world that grown-ups do, the experience of walking a mall or sitting in a diner to drink coffee and have conversation. Without awareness and intervention, more clarity still: he is fucked.

It’s funny, right? You were just talking about donuts three minutes ago and now an ad pops up on your phone for donuts. You googled “it hurts when I piss,” and now your TV is showing ads for your local pharmacy. It’s funny to joke about it, right? About how Google and Alexa are listening to us, about how companies know everything? No, it isn’t fucking funny. 


We have lost our privacy. 


We have lost our liberty. 


What did we get for it? We weren’t even paid for it. Instead, we got the privilege of divisive, individualized algorithms manipulating our brain chemistry to extract every last cent from us. We got bells, whistles, flashy animations, the ability to create a “unique” fucking emoji: targeted fucking ads and algorithms designed to predict and then dictate what we need and when we need it. 

And while we are being honest with ourselves as Americans, there is a time and a place for profanity. When something is egregiously fucking over your lives, the lives of your fellow citizens, and the lives of your kids, while masquerading as a public service, it is abso-fucking-lutely appropriate to use profanity.

What else have we surrendered while being distracted by crushing the most candy and buying the most disposable shit, in a size slightly larger than our neighbors’ disposable shit? 


Artificial intelligence.


Artificial intelligence.


Artificial intelligence.


Maybe you think you know something about AI, maybe you actually do. Maybe you don’t know shit about AI. Here’s what you need to know:

AI will very likely become the most significant advancement in human history

AI is built upon the collective work and brainpower of humanity over thousands of years

AI has the potential to make the world a better place, a happier place, for Americans and others

AI has already made very rich people a shit-ton of money.

AI has the potential to make many more rich people more money than they could spend in 1,000 lifetimes

AI has the potential to destroy humanity; yes, we need to all watch/re-watch every.single.Terminator.movie.ever.made.
You’re welcome, Arnold.

We have all surrendered our claim to one of the greatest technological advancements in human history because it’s cool to get recipe ideas from ChatGPT. It’s fun to have AI write a research paper for us, so that we don’t have to do any actual research. It’s entertaining for AI to come up with a slogan for the fake company we’re designing. 

It’s all bullshit. The richest people on Earth are, RIGHT FUCKING NOW, figuring out how to use AI to fuck us all over, so that they can stay the richest people on Earth forever. And by the way, if it doesn’t work out well, fuck us all, since money can buy better mega-bunkers and a fucking army of drones, so again: fuck us all.

And guess what? The proud patriots we are guzzle it down, eagerly, because they’ve trained our brains to be so fucking grateful for any bullshit electronic novelty that is fed to us.

Which would we prefer? All of that, continuing until 10 people have every cent of our collective wealth? Or would we prefer having the time, energy, and economic freedom to raise our families, to see our friends, to explore, to travel, to write, to enjoy nature, to enjoy other people? 


CALL TO ACTION 1: We will not use any Artificial Intelligence (AI) product unless and until the world’s population receives 50% of the profits earned by Artificial Intelligence products and advancements. Every single person on Earth. And Americans, we get an extra 5% on top of that, because despite what the rest of the world sees and thinks they know, we can unite and we can mobilize. We have been lazy, complacent, and naive in letting a handful of billionaires decide what we consume and what our lives will be. No more. 

And if the response, from anyone, is “there’s no way to make this work,” two words: fuck you. Figure it out. Even better, have AI figure it out. 

And another 10% of AI profits will be used to fund research on human connection and cooperation. 

Americans, despite having differences, know deeply: when we are connected, united, one, anything can be accomplished. Anything. This is not hyperbole.

Gas. Eggs. Streaming Services. We know. We are being gouged. We are being looted. It is an insult to our intelligence. 

Food delivery services that we now rely upon so heavily: what have they done for us? They have disconnected us, removed our opportunity for human interaction, for conversation. They have replaced “customer service” with lengthy terms and conditions, so that when there is a problem, we are placed in a loop of texts, chats, and AI garbage, until we give up. And they have let us pay premiums for the privilege of “convenience.” We’ll charge you 30% more of menu prices, pay our drivers shit, and ignore any problems you may have. Guess what? Fuck you too, and fuck that.

The bottom line is that we have the power to retake the narrative. We want lower prices, the filthy rich don’t give a single fuck. What are we going to do about it, they ask, rhetorically?

They are correct. We haven’t done shit. We’ve allowed Amazon to rule us, Netflix to raise prices for shittier content, real human customer service to die. Fuck them.

I have been hearing a lot of:

“I know, but what can we do?” 

“They have the control. There’s nothing we can do about it.”

“I feel helpless. I want to do something other than shout on the internet.”

“We need to strike. We need to march” ⇒ “We have marched, it hasn’t done anything.”

We made the greatest empire in the world at the time fuck off because we collectively protested. Protests are our birthright. Protest is more American than apple pie.

What will we do then?

And be aware, the richest human on Earth is currently infiltrating our government institutions and freedoms, which our brave men and women have protected at the highest levels. No UNELECTED individual should have control over our federal government. You are being had. We are being had. 


CALL TO ACTION 2: March March 

We will March.

The month of March.

Amazon doesn’t give a shit if millions of us show up with signs about their greed. They don’t give a shit what we say on the internet in our carefully-controlled echo chambers. 

One thing rules them. One thing controls them. And we have it too: money. 

March 2025 we send our message. For the entirety of that month, we will boycott Amazon. We will disconnect from social media, entirely. We will use no streaming service. And before the end of March 2025, the companies will cut their prices, allow their employees to unionize, and pledge to never use corporate money to influence any political or policy decision ever again. The people have the power.

If the prospect of not using a product or service or media outlet for one month seems impossible to you, that is a big fucking problem. And you’re welcome. 

If all of your information comes from one place, you are being had. 

If your information is being influenced by someone that is trying to sell you on anything other than more, verifiable information, you are being had.

If social media gives companies your data, your interests, your experiences, your motivations, your habits, YOUR LIFE…FOR FREE, you are being had.

And guess what? We are all being had.

March 2025. They believe we are sheep, and that we will perpetually call each other sheep. We know who the wolves are. The exploitation is about to end. 

When did you last write a letter? A physical letter? Have you written a physical letter?

When did you last call a friend, and have an actual conversation?

When did you last knock on a neighbor’s door to offer help, or be friendly?

We don’t trust ([Americans' trust in other Americans | Pew Research Center](https://worldhappiness.report/)), because we don’t talk.


CALL TO ACTION 3: Talk

No plan is perfect. No idea accounts for every variable. Apathy kills change.

You want to whine, complain, propose your own solution? Go for it. You want to do something, anything, then do something. 

Starting now, have a fucking conversation. Talk about something, talk about this, offer a service, offer a favor, ask about family. Talk.

If we don’t start communicating, and unifying, we are doomed. If we swallow the algorithmic enslavement and corporate control, our children will not have happiness. 

Turn off the fucking television, shut off your fucking phone, and let’s remind each other that we’re fucking Americans, all of us. 

America. Fuck yeah.


This is step one.

1ij1zk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ij1zk1/cuisinart_cpo800p1_pureprecision_review_for/,Cuisinart CPO-800P1 PurePrecision review for coffee lovers,"Every day starts with coffee for me, and testing the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 PurePrecision 8 Cup Pour-Over Coffee Brewer has been a delightful experience. As someone who enjoys a bold cup of coffee but doesn't want to spend the morning babysitting a coffee maker, this machine intrigued me. Over the past few weeks, I've been using it daily, analyzing its design, brewing capability, and practicality. Here's my take.

The **design and build quality** immediately caught my attention. The sleek silver finish fits right into a modern kitchen aesthetic, and its compact size didn’t dominate my counter space. The build feels sturdy, and the glass carafe adds a touch of elegance. Despite its beauty, I noticed the carafe lid can sometimes trap water after cleaning. Nothing a quick shake can't fix, but it's worth mentioning.

[Check Cuisinart CPO-800P1 PurePrecision price on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/cuisinart-cpo-800p1-review-with-glass-carafe-b0142uuvde/)

Moving on to **brewing performance**, this is where the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 really shines. The fully automatic pour-over function mimics the manual brewing process, pre-wetting the grounds to let the coffee bloom. I’ve tested both the ""hot"" and ""extra hot"" temperature settings, and both deliver coffee that’s piping hot without scalding. The brewing time is consistent, and the 24-hour programmability means I can wake up to a fresh pot of coffee every morning. That’s a game changer for me, especially on busy weekdays. The one drawback? The filter basket can leak slightly when the carafe is removed during brewing, so caution is required.

The **coffee flavor** is exceptional. Whether I set it to mild, medium, or bold, the machine consistently extracts rich and smooth flavors. I tested it with various beans, from light roasts to dark, and the results were satisfying each time. My sister, a self-proclaimed coffee snob, even gave it her stamp of approval during her visit. However, I did detect a very slight difference in smoothness compared to my French press, but the convenience more than makes up for it.

**Cleaning and maintenance** are straightforward. The glass carafe is easy to clean with a bottle brush, and the machine's self-clean feature is a lifesaver. I also appreciate the inclusion of a charcoal water filter, though I use filtered water at home and may not need to replace it. It’s worth noting that the stainless steel permanent filter does let through some sediment, so I prefer using paper filters for a cleaner cup.

**Pros**

* Excellent brewing performance and temperature control.
* Sleek, modern design that complements any kitchen.
* Produces rich, flavorful coffee with customizable strength settings.
* Easy to program and includes a self-clean feature.
* Glass carafe doesn’t leak when pouring.

**Cons**

* Filter basket can leak slightly when the carafe isn’t in place.
* Carafe lid traps water after cleaning.
* Stainless steel filter may not filter out all sediment.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Technivorm Moccamaster, the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 is significantly more affordable while maintaining SCAA certification for high brewing standards. The Moccamaster, while excellent, requires manual intervention, such as stirring the grounds, whereas the Cuisinart offers a more hands-off experience. On the other hand, the Bonavita coffee maker, another competitor, feels less sturdy and has issues with carafe leakage, something the Cuisinart handles better.

That said, the Moccamaster’s thermal carafe does a superior job of keeping coffee hot for extended periods, whereas the Cuisinart’s glass carafe relies on a warming plate. If you prioritize heat retention over aesthetics, the Moccamaster might edge out slightly. Still, the Cuisinart offers better value for money for most coffee drinkers.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

While the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 isn’t the cheapest coffee maker on the market, its features justify the investment. It bridges the gap between high-end manual pour-over coffee makers and traditional drip machines. The SCAA certification ensures quality, and the programmable settings make it practical for daily use. Compared to competitors, it offers a great balance of performance and cost, making it worth considering for coffee enthusiasts who don’t want to break the bank.

Every feature of this coffee maker seems thoughtfully designed, from the temperature control to the flavor strength adjustments. The Brew Pause feature, which lets you grab a cup mid-brew, came in handy when my impatient uncle couldn’t wait for the full pot to finish.

Overall, using the Cuisinart CPO-800P1 has been a rewarding experience. It’s not without its flaws, but the combination of convenience, quality, and design makes it a strong contender in the world of home coffee brewing.

It felt like no matter how hard I worked, I was always behind. Every day was a rush, trying to catch up, juggling deadlines, and honestly, I just couldn’t keep up with it all. It felt like I was drowning in papers and notes, and no matter how much coffee I drank, I just couldn’t focus.

On top of all that, the pressure from my job was weighing on me too. Balancing work responsibilities with school was no easy feat. I was constantly stressed about making sure everything was perfect at work, while also trying to stay on top of assignments. It was like there was no end to the pressure, no matter how much I tried to keep everything in check.

I started questioning myself....how was everyone else managing? Was I just not cut out for it? I was really beating myself up over it, and it was making everything worse. I tried asking friends for tips, but we were all in the same boat, struggling with the same things. We were all stressed out and just getting by.

Then, one day, I came across a post online.....someone casually mentioned how they had found a way to make things easier with their assignments. At first, I wasn’t sure what to make of it. I thought, “Could this actually be real?” But I was at my breaking point, so I figured, “Why not? What’s the worst that could happen?”

I know that it might not be the “right” way to handle things according to some people, and maybe I should have pushed through like everyone says we should. But honestly, at that point, I felt like it was my right to give it a shot. I was just so exhausted and stressed, I needed something to change.

So I gave it a try, and to my surprise, it really helped. I wasn’t handing over my work to someone else; I just got the support I needed to make sense of everything. It wasn’t magic, but it took off the pressure, and I finally felt like I could breathe again. I actually had time to focus and understand what I was doing, instead of just rushing through everything.

It made me realize that sometimes we don’t have to do it all alone. It’s okay to admit when you need help. It doesn’t make you weak or less capable; it just means you’re smart enough to find a way to manage the load. And that’s something I wish I had realized earlier.

So yeah, if you’re feeling stuck or overwhelmed, remember...........you don’t have to do it all by yourself. There are ways to make things a little easier, and it’s okay to ask for that help. After all, for once, it’s our right to give something new a shot.",1,1738846773.0,college,2,1.0,False

I’d like to share my detailed experience for the CA-PI round at NMIMS. My slot was on **6th Feb 2025 at 10 AM**. Here’s a step-by-step transcript-style recap of the entire process—from the lobby entry to the final panel interview.



# Pre-Assessment and Lobby Process

**Arrival & Lobby:**

* **Time:** 10:00 AM
* I entered the lobby, which was even better than a 5-star hotel!
* Upon arrival, we were asked to submit our belongings and fill out an instruction form.

**Group Organization:**

* We were then escorted to a room with a board listing each candidate’s name and divided into groups.
* I had to find my name and then move to the auditorium, where we sat with our respective groups while the faculties took attendance.
* Attendance finished by **10:30 AM**.

# Competency Assessment

**Location:**

* We were then taken to our respective labs for the competency assessment.

**Test Details:**

* **Start Time:** 10:45 AM
* **Duration:** 45 minutes (Ends at 11:30 AM)
* **Total Questions:** 20, divided into 3 sections:
   * **Verbal Ability:** 9 questions *Tip: These were easy and could be solved using elimination if your verbal skills aren’t strong.*
   * **Mental Ability:** 6 questions *This section included 1 matrix set (4 questions) plus one question each from argument and course of action. Overall, it was very easy.*
   * **Managerial Ability:** 5 questions *This section was the trickiest—with technical questions that weren’t about decision-making but could be tackled using elimination and some brainpower.*

**Post-Test Refreshments:**

* After the test, we were taken to another room where sandwiches and coffee/tea were served.

# CA-PI (Computer-Assisted & Panel Interview)

**Grouping & Timing:**

* At noon, candidates were taken to different rooms group-wise.
* **My Turn:** 12:30 PM

**Interview Room Setup:**

* I entered a big classroom with one faculty member and a computer.
* The faculty greeted me, and the **AI interview** began immediately.

**AI Interview:**

* **Focus:** All questions were related to my Statement of Purpose (SOP).
* *Note:* There were no questions about current affairs during this round.

**Panel Interview:**  
After the AI round, the professor started his session. Below is a transcript-style breakdown:

* **Professor:** “What do you want to do with your life?” **Me:** *\[I explained my long-term career goals.\]*
* **Professor:** “Which specialization are you interested in?” **Me:** *\[I stated my specialization choice.\]*
* **Professor:** “Why that specialization?” **Me:** *\[I explained my rationale and passion for it.\]*
* **Professor:** “What other calls do you have?” **Me:** *\[I mentioned any other offers or interests I had.\]*
* **Professor:** “What is your preference order?” **Me:** “NMIMS is my first preference.”
* **Professor:** “Do you have any questions for me?” **Me:** *\[I asked a very specific question, which impressed him, and he then answered for about 2–3 minutes.\]*

**Overall Interview Duration:**

* The combined AI and panel interview lasted for about 20 minutes.

# Final Thoughts

I would say that the CA process went well and the overall interview was average. For context, here’s a snapshot of my profile:

* **GEM Fresher:** 8/8/8
* **NMAT Score:** 258",11,1738846512.0,CATpreparation,7,0.92,False

This is the risk of her being in love with her best friend but also what made their relationship special for me. When they broke up, she wasn't just grieving over Luke being gone in her life as her partner but also as her best friend; apart from the fact that she knows the breakup partly happened because of her.

Imagine her not getting her daily dose of quesadilla and coffee from the diner before going to work and not being able to go there at random times in a day just to rant about something, to celebrate and to treat herself when she's having a bad day. Luke's diner wasn't just a place to eat but a source of comfort for her so losing Luke in her life meant so much more. 

That's also the reason why I know they'll find a way to fight for their relationship. Luke isn't perfect with his temper and all his outbursts and chemistry-wise, I honestly prefer Christopher and Lorelai's more but he is so much more than that. He's made up of all these little things he did for Lorelai and Rory and they will always matter more.

[$600-800],"If it would make a (big) noticeable difference, I'd like to upgrade from the grinder built-into my recently acquired Breville Barista Touch Impress, in order to do drip/filter/maybe pour-overs. It seems like it would be a bit of a hassle to use the Breville's grinder for the new drip machine I'm planning on getting, and I assume that the Baratza in the Breville is, at least somewhat, optimized for espresso grinds, anyway.  

I'm thinking of $600-800 + tax, and after considering the Niche Duo, the Turin/MiiCoffee D83v, and even the Mazzer Philos (I know, more like $1k), I'm now thinking I should keep it simpler, go with a bigger company, more automaticity (consider my espresso machine choice above; in fact. I would have gone with the Oracle Jet if I had found out about that relatively new model, a week earlier), and going with the Baratza Vario W+. It's $599 and I can buy it on Amazon (with a Prime Card, get an extended warranty, and pay over the next 12 months, 0% interest).  

 Questions: 

1. Would the Vario W+ allow (much) better tasting drip/filter coffee (using say, a Wolf ""Gourmet Programmable"" machine) compared to the grinder built into the Breville? 
2. Would the Vario be better for espresso in the Breville, if later I were to develop an interest in tinkering with/tweaking my espresso shots/drinks?  Or, would I need to replace the burrs to make such an improvement (if that's even an option w/ the Vario W+)?  
3. Or, would the Baratza Sette 270Wi be a better choice (again, mainly for drip/filter/etc.), at the same $599 price (Amazon)? It's my understanding that that machine is mostly aimed at grinds for espresso.

*February 5, 2025*

I f(31) recently signed up to sit an advanced German exam with the full support and encouragement of my M(30) husband. 

We live in Germany where I work in an English-speaking environment, so to get extra practice in, I told him that after x date, we'd switch to German, which he is fluent in (grew up here). We've managed two days so far, where even if he accidentally says something in English I answer in German, but last night he told me he needed a break from me speaking German. 

I refused, and said it's only for 10 weeks until my exam, then I'll go back to English. He says I don't sound like his wife when I speak German. I asked if it was because my mistakes were jarring or my vocab was causing issues. He said it just 'didn't feel like he was speaking to his wife'. I think it's vital that I stick to my plan, to get my speaking practice in. He seemed a bit sad after I said no. 

WIBTAH if I carry on auf Deutsch?

Consensus: Asshole. People pointed out it must be tiring and irritating to not have a single normal conversation with your spouse.

>#Notable comments:

Your husband saying ""you don't sound like my wife"" in German isn't about your language skills - it's about missing the natural, intimate connection you share in English. While your dedication to learning is admirable, there's a smarter way to do this that won't strain your marriage.

Instead of going full German 24/7, try this:

* Schedule specific ""German Time"" slots (breakfast, evening walks, one meal a day)
* Keep emotional or important conversations in English
* Maybe do a fun weekly ""German Date Night""
* Use English when either of you needs to feel closer

Think of it like a musician practicing - they don't play intensively 24/7, they have dedicated practice times. You can still ace your exam without making your husband feel emotionally disconnected for 10 weeks.

Bottom line: YWBTA. There are many ways to practice German, but you've only got one husband. Find the balance that lets you grow your skills while keeping your relationship strong. Your marriage shouldn't have to take a 10-week pause for an exam. 💕 [Dramatic-Draw6973](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ii6hjp/wibtah_if_i_only_spoke_german_to_my_husband/mb348om/)

Yeah, I'm in the same position of being a native speaker and my partner wanting to practice. It's great and I love his enthusiasm, but it can also feel tiring especially in the early stages of learning. There is a compromise to be had of scheduling specific days or time of days so it feels less like being a teacher 24/7. More isn't always better.

And there's also something to be said about learning by being exposed to the language outside of the relationship. Everyone is more relaxed with their partner, mistakes don't matter, and you have predictable conversation topics. Being outside, talking to random people in random situations exposes you to new conversations and accents and reactions. So going to meetups or chatting with a waiter can offer more practice.

Not claiming you’re the ass here but I can only imagine going through the daily stress of work and what not. Then coming home just wanting to relax and have a calm conversation with my wife. Only to be met with and extra conversation every time we speak where I’m teaching her grammar through each piece of dialogue [mauiwowiy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ii6hjp/wibtah_if_i_only_spoke_german_to_my_husband/mb2yg4i/)

Yta. I understand why you want to do this but it’s unfair on your partner.

I also live in Germany with a German speaking partner. I did c2 German last year and was very worried about the spoken part, so my partner and I had one day a week which was German day. That was more than enough to help me pass. Perhaps suggest something like that? If that doesn’t work for him, try to find a tandem partner to help with your spoken German. Or even a friend with whom you can have German coffee dates.

Changing the language of your long term relationship is hard to do, and can be exhausting for you both. And as others have said, your personality does shift when you change languages. I know I’m much less funny in German for example, and that therefore would change the nature of my relationship with my partner if we were suddenly 100% speaking German all the time.

… YTA. He’s your husband, not your teacher, and he made a plea for just a break. 

Practice on someone else from time to time, let him have a little bit of english from you at least once a day. Maybe set a plan where you speak english at breakfast, for example, so you have a block of time where he knows what to expect and when not to expect it.

YTA So you decided you two would only speak the language, and then when he expressed discomfort you said his feelings are not more important than your wants? [Forsaken-Volume-2249](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ii6hjp/wibtah_if_i_only_spoke_german_to_my_husband/mb3f4qt/)

*February 5, 2025, about 9 hours later*

Thanks to most of you for very well-thought out and reasonable comments.

 I tried to read as many as possible and appreciate the different viewpoints. My husband came home this evening, we ate dinner, and I apologised (in English) for not being very understanding. I showed him the post... some of the comments made us laugh so much. 

We discussed and found a healthy compromise that works for both of us to help me prep but not exhaust him after a long day! I've also taken on your suggestions of other places I can try and hone my German conversation skills and will try some of them out.

So I’m an iced coffee fan who has never owned an at home coffee machine before, other than briefly having access to my uni housemate’s cheap Nespresso machine years ago, which I didn’t like much. My previous workplace had a Jura WE8 which I loved. I loved how simple it was to make a delicious iced coffee, and that it was so easy to keep clean, as each team would rotate kitchen duty but I was never across any maintenance/repair related stuff so no clue what that’s like. When I left that job I looked up how much a Jura WE8 would cost for me to buy one for home and nearly fell off my chair, it seems the only coffee machine experience I’ve had is from opposite sides of the market lol and I definitely can’t afford a WE8. I have seen a sale for a Jura E6 at $1300 (AUD) which is basically the ceiling of what I can afford. I’ve also heard stories of people having Jura machines that have lasted 20 years which really appeals to me as I’m someone who values sustainability (which was also a big reason I didn’t like the Nespresso machine). My question is, will I be disappointed with the Jura E6 since it’s the cheapest of the Jura models and I’ve had experience with the WE8? Or is it a “worst house in the best street” sorta situation and worth it because Jura is a solid brand? Thank you in advance for your thoughts!",1,1738845484.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

1ij1iiy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ij1iiy,Like a shot of espresso in a pen - Robert Oster Caffe Crema,"I'm a fan of brown inks and the ink I've been enjoying a lot lately is Robert Oster's Caffe Crema. The color looks so rich and luscious! In the converter, the ink looks like a shot of espresso. I love coffee so I'm really drawn towards this aptly named ink. Besides the color, the next best thing about this ink is the beautiful shading, which is emphasized in a medium nib. 

I used my Jinhao Century 100 with an <M> nib here. I've read reviews about this ink being a dry ink so I wonder if that's why I had hard starts with this pen. When I first filled this pen around 2 weeks ago, I'd get a hard start almost every time and I'd try writing in different angles to get the pen to write. I'd have to apply more pressure on the nib in the beginning to get the ink flowing. Once the ink starts flowing though, it would write smoothly and continuosly, like the nib just glides over my Rhodia pad without having to apply pressure. Now that the tines have loosened a bit, I rarely get a hard start with this pen now (still inked with Caffe Crema).

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1ij14gc,https://i.redd.it/1zcofg3xfihe1.png,DevBlog #54: Post engine rework bug-fixing,"​Hello and welcome to another WalkScape devblog!
​

Last week we released the massive work that had been going for the last couple months, reworking the game engine, our servers and more. As expected, this amount of changes came with some bugs that were not spotted in our internal testing. For the next week or two, we'll focus on fixing the issues. A list of the issues that are currently known is here: 
​

[Reddit post of known issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/WalkScape/s/DaAjuWriX3)
​

This development blog post will be a bit shorter one than usually, as post-release our main priorities are to fix any issues or bugs that arise, so there aren't much news to share.


# Buy Me a Coffee fix


Buy Me a Coffee had an issue due to their APIs being quite buggy. We've now deployed a fix to this, and anyone who were previously having an issue with their BMAC supporter tier not showing up should now have it working. The speed that BMAC is connected to WalkScape account should also be quicker.
​

Please let us know if you still have an issue with BMAC by contacting our email!
​
# Anti-cheat improvements


With the engine rework, we've also released our improved anti-cheat. 
​

The new system has shown some really great results, and we've banned a bunch of players that we've caught cheating in the game. We're very happy with the new system, and it should support hundreds of thousands or even millions of players, so definitely a lot more scalable than our previous solutions. Our new anri-cheat also can be more easily improved over time, which is also a great things.
​

Most of the time, I like to stay quite tight lipped about our anti-cheat development so that potential cheaters can't prepare for what we're working on. However, a lot of people are always quite skeptical if fitness games are able to run anti-cheat measures effectively. I think it's mostly due to people's experience with Pokemon Go, and how badly it was handled there.
​

We take cheating very seriously, and will keep improving our anti-cheat as much as possible, and already have some effective solutions in place. And  it's definitely possible to build anti-cheat solutions for games like these!
​

# Short term plans


Like covered in the previous development blog post, we'll be fixing the bugs for next week or two until we have the game stable again. Then, I'll be moving onto building our new improved development tools (devtools 2.0) so we can start delivering new content again!
​

We already have art and designs for multiple new content updates, and our goal with devtools 2.0 is to remove any bottenecks from developing and releasing new content of the game. Maxchill and floursifter have been hard at work, and we can't wait to get these things released!
​

# Until next time


That's it for this time!
​

Considering how massive this rework was:
[Github merge](https://i.postimg.cc/4dCxy36K/image.png)


It goes without saying that we were expecting a lot of issues, but I'm actually surprisesurprised how few there were. The biggest and most tricky issue to solve is the issue we have with the new server tech, where there's a memory leak. This results in the server restarting every 5 hours or so, so if you're having hard time connecting it's often resolved if you try again in few minutes.
​

Thanks for the patience, and we'll keep working on fixing the new issues! I might include a couple small QoL improvements here and there too - we have a pretty good list of suggested small improvements that wwouldn't take that long to implement. I already implemented a few in this update: banking from the bank button in inventory, starting actuvities from the world map, wardrobes in all settlements, and so on.

Later, while he was in the shower, I checked his phone. I found out they’ve been getting coffee and lunch, sometimes for work, sometimes not. Previously, they communicated about once a month, but last week she joined a board he’s on. They had a board meeting, then went out as a group for drinks. I knew he was out with colleagues and wasn’t worried—until I saw that he texted her afterward, making sure she got home safe and saying he’d hoped for more chances to talk with her.
