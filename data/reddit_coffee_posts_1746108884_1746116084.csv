My partner and I just moved to SF from Japan (we‚Äôre not Japanese, but we lived and worked in Tokyo for a few years) and we‚Äôve been seriously craving a good, authentic matcha latte!

We‚Äôve tried a few from local or well-known coffee chains, but they just don‚Äôt hit the same‚Äîsomething about the balance, richness, or even the type of matcha used isn‚Äôt quite like what we‚Äôre used to in Japan or other parts of Asia.

Since we‚Äôre still new to the city, we‚Äôd love any recommendations! Are there any hidden gems or specialty cafes that serve a solid matcha latte?

1kccldy,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kccldy/i_think_my_business_will_fail_what_are_my_next/,I think my business will fail what are my next steps?,"So last year I started a mobile coffee business (food truck) in a college town. It is hard to see it succeeding in the long run. Starting it put me 60k in the hole and the work is grueling. Not that I don‚Äôt enjoy running it I actually love working outside in social settings sharing what I can make, but I just can‚Äôt see this working out. Im going to see if I can pull some levers this month so I stop operating at a loss. I‚Äôm starting my second year and I‚Äôm so overwhelmed with work as I‚Äôm running it on my own and working full time (I‚Äôm cutting my hours soon to try and pay myself) my original plan was to start with mobile coffee and one day start a brick and mortar, but I think what I want has changed. I don‚Äôt want to be responsible for other people to count on me. I think starting this has taught me a lot of valuable skills, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm cut out for it.

My main question is if it does fail and I‚Äôm done running this business what could I do next? I can liquidate part of this business so the monthly loan payment won‚Äôt be as bad. What careers after this could I follow? Would a roastery hire me? I wasn‚Äôt cut out for college and dropped out a few years ago and I can‚Äôt go back. I‚Äôve worked in food service since then.

I get super anxious making small talk even with people I‚Äôve known for literally all my life. Like chatting with a coworker at lunch or running into an old friend while grabbing coffee. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to talk, I just feel this wave of nervous energy kick in and my brain starts scrambling for something ‚Äúnormal‚Äù to say.  
  
What‚Äôs extra frustrating is that I can handle deep conversations just fine. If we‚Äôre talking about something real like I‚Äôm totally comfortable. But if someone goes, ‚ÄúHow was your weekend?‚Äù I immediately freeze, or give the most painfully boring answer possible, then spiral afterward wondering if I sounded weird.  
Like, this past weekend I did a few errands, caught up on laundry that I've been literally pushing away for the last 2 weeks and cleared out some old stuff I ended up selling online, but I still hesitated when someone asked me what I‚Äôd been up to. It‚Äôs like I assume no one actually wants to hear the real answer, so I end up second-guessing myself and giving some short, awkward reply instead.

About two hours after I got a slight headache so I took some tylenol and iced my head a little in case there was a bump forming. I feel a little sleepy but I feel like that is regular for me during a work day, I can walk, do tasks, and even took my dog out a second time. The only thing that is kind of persisting despite the tylenol is a headache, the headache is also not in the location where I hit my head. I do feel a little fuzzy but again, that could just be tired from working. I also did not get to have a coffee as I do every day because I fell.

  
I know when you have a concussion you generally know right away - but is there anything I can do to in the meantime? I've never had any kind of head injury and I think a lot of how I'm feeling might be general sleepiness, and anxiety.

### Training
 
This training cycle was probably one of the most difficult marathon training cycles I‚Äôve had. This past winter was the coldest winter that the area I live in had experienced in quite some time, and there were days where it was so cold that it was unsafe to do a workout outside (because of ice) or the temperatures were cold enough where I had to adjust workout paces and be smart about the cold and impacts on performances. The first few weeks of training featured a lot of lower mileage, adjusted training plans, and safely getting in runs and workouts whenever possible. 
 
To add onto the colder-than-usual winter, I‚Äôve been dealing with a sore groin and abductor since last summer. I was able to keep it at bay during the fall marathon training cycle (I was able to run sub-3 marathon results [at Indianapolis]( https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1hp9n02/2024_indianapolis_monumental_marathon_255/) and at Valencia), but it was still hanging around and it didn‚Äôt feel great after completing runs. (The colder-than-usual winter didn‚Äôt help it either). Knowing that I wanted to have a solid Boston training cycle, I decided to regularly see a PT. This was well worth the investment; over the next few months, the soreness gradually went from a regular occurrence to an occasional occurrence, and physically I felt a whole lot better after finishing up runs and workouts. Another motivation for seeing a PT regularly was that I read too many stories where Boston runners rolled up to the start line with varying degrees of injuries from training, and I did not want to be like one of those runners. 
 
During this training cycle, I ran anywhere 55 and 70 miles per week. Here were some key workouts that I did during this cycle.
 
* Nine weeks out: 20 miles with 12 miles alternating mile repeats (alternating between 6:15 per mile for a mile followed by 6:40 per mile for a mile), which I did 9 weeks out
* Eight weeks out: 10 x 1 K at 10K pace with 2 minutes jog recovery in between, which I did 8 weeks out
* Five weeks out: tune up local half marathon that happened to be quite hilly. I ended up treating it as a workout on the second half of the race to mitigate injury risk, and finished with a sub-1:25 result.
* Four weeks out: 6 x 1 mile at 10K pace with 90 seconds rest in between (5:57 per mile for the 10K pace), which I did 4 weeks out
* Three weeks out: 22 miles with 4 x 3 miles at MP (6:28-6:32 per mile). It felt quite smooth, even when doing this workout with temperatures in the 60s and high humidity. 
* Two weeks out: Cherry Blossom 10 Mile Run. I treated it as a workout and did not race it all out; I ran this at slightly faster than marathon pace (6:27 per mile).
 
In addition to the above key workout sessions, I had a few high aerobic sessions where I ran miles at slightly slower than marathon pace (6:50-7:10 per mile). I also did some hill work early on to prepare for the rolling hills found on the Boston course, but my coach decided to cut back on it to avoid straining my groin and abductors while I was continuing to rehab it. This decision ensured that I remained mostly healthy for the rest of the training cycle. However, this also meant that I came in very underprepared on the hills in Boston (and I would feel it during the race). Ultimately, this was the right call my coach made; it was a choice between showing up healthy and being able to put together a decent race, versus coming in injured and risk having a sub-optimal race (or worse, aggravating existing injuries and dropping out). Between the two, the choice was obvious.
 
I would be remiss if I didn‚Äôt include my A, B, and C goals. Considering the issues I dealt with during this training cycle and the challenging nature of the Boston Marathon course, it was important to have these goals in case my race went sideways so that I had other goals to fall back on and avoid a situation where I was second guessing myself or letting intrusive thoughts win during the race. I assessed that the chances of my race going sideways at Boston was significantly high because of the nature of the course itself (and my first time running it). Based on how my training and workouts went, I established these goals for myself:
 
* A goal: Sub-2:50 marathon
* B goal: Sub-2:55 marathon
* C goal: Finish with a sub-3 hour marathon result 
 
Above all, I was dead set on making it across the finish line just under 3 hours. I was on the verge of becoming a Six Star Finisher, and I was going to do everything I can to close it out.
 
### Pre-race
 
I flew up to Boston on Friday, and met up with my parents who flew out from the West Coast to see me run Boston. I went to the expo on Friday and spent a few hours there picking up my bib and checked out the booths. Over the weekend, I spent time checking out the pop up stores on Newbury Street, checked out some sights, but otherwise tried to not walk around too much. I mainly ate at coffee shops for lunch and hit up numerous restaurants in the North End neighborhood for dinner. Talking to friends who have ran Boston before, they told me that restaurants gets packed during Boston Marathon weekend, and so I booked reservations for the North End restaurants at least a couple months in advance, and that was a clutch decision on my part; it removed one significant source of stress that could have existed on that weekend. I‚Äôll likely do this again the next time I run Boston in the future.
 
Otherwise, everything else went smoothly leading up to the race. I got plenty of sleep (received 7-8 hours of sleep each night), drank Maurten 320s in the evenings as part of my pre-race fueling strategy, and I did not experience any last-minute pop up injuries. The night before, I did my usual pre-race routine the night before the race by preparing my race kit and loading up my drop bag with items I‚Äôd need after I crossed the finish line.
 
On race morning, I woke up sometime after 5 AM and had a bagel, banana and water for breakfast, and I put in another bagel in my small area bag to bring with me to Athletes‚Äô Village. I left my hotel after 6:30 AM and walked over to the Boston Common to board the school buses. It took me about 15 minutes after I reached the entrance to the bus lines to board the school buses, and the bus departed for Hopkinton as soon as it loaded to full capacity. The bus ride to Hopkinton took about an hour; on the bus ride there, I chatted with a few guys around me, and I got to know a bit more about them: where they came from, how they got into Boston, and their goals for the day. Those guys invited me to hang out with them at Athletes‚Äô Village, of which I readily accepted.
 
Arriving at Hopkinton, we were dropped off at the high school and walked into the fields behind the school itself. I spent the next hour and a half going to the porta potties a couple of times, hanging out with the guys that were on my bus, getting a picture with the famous Hopkinton sign, and eating my second small breakfast while waiting for my wave (red wave/corral 1) to be called up. My wave was called up at 9:30 AM, and I began my three-quarters mile walk to the start line. Near the start area, I stopped by the porta potties one more time, put on sunscreen offered by the organizers after seeing that the sun was going to be shining brightly throughout the day (this turned out to be a wise decision), and walked over to my corral and lined up with everyone else who was seeded in my corral. I made some small chat to fellow runners around me while we waited for the race to start.
 
After the National Anthem was sung and the typical pre-race remarks were made, the gun went off at 10 AM, and after a minute I crossed the start line and we were off!
 
### Race

## Conserve on the Downhills (Miles 1-6)

I‚Äôve read advice from Boston veterans too many times to count that the first few miles are crowded (because of the narrow roads), run by effort and stay in place instead of weaving around, and to not panic if your mile splits are slower than what you‚Äôd expect. I adhered to that advice for the most part; I went by effort for the first few miles to get warmed up and stayed in place even when others around me zoomed ahead. I took a Maurten gel during the first couple of miles to get me going.

During the first few miles, I looked around and couldn‚Äôt believe myself. After qualifying and not making it on the cutoffs the first time, then subsequently running faster marathons to make it in on the second try, I was finally here. *I am running the freaking Boston Marathon for the very first time*. I was smiling throughout this stretch and taking in the cheering crowds who gathered during this stretch. A few runners saw that I was going to become a Six Star Finisher (I had a special bib from Abbott WMMs that was pinned to the back of my racing singlet) and came up to me to congratulate me.

I came through the first 10K in just a bit over 40 minutes and my splits were a touch slower than what I had planned for. This was perfect; I didn‚Äôt go out blazing hot on the downhills and risked overcooking myself during the second half. So far, so good. The crowds greeting us as we ran through Framingham were solid, too!

## Cruising Along (Mile 6-16)

After the downhill-fueled first few miles, the course flattened out around mile 6 and I eased into my marathon effort/pace. There were rolling hills along the way, and I navigated through them by effort (notably when there was an uphill around mile 15 followed by a steep downhill on mile 16). For the most part, I felt mostly good through this section. The crowds greeting us at Natick was solid, but the so-called ‚ÄúWellsley Scream Tunnel‚Äù at mile 12 was incredibly unreal after reading all about it over the years. They were cheering their heads off and it was nonstop cheering for almost a mile. I took the opportunity to go through the crowds and high fived as many of them as possible (Unfortunately, I did not kiss any of the women there; that‚Äôll probably have to wait for next time!). There were thick crowds when I ran through downtown Wellsley, where the halfway point was. I came through the halfway point in 1:26 and change. Race Screen suggested I was on track to finish in the 2:52 range. I thought to myself *‚Äùnot too bad, this was a solid first half by you, but the hard work now begins‚Äù*.

By this point, the sun was shining *very* brightly and temperatures were in the 50s. I started to feel the heat from the sun and the warmth from the sun being reflected off the road surfaces. I began to pick up water from those aid stations and tossed it on myself to keep myself cool. Thank goodness for the aid stations that were present every mile! As for fueling, I took a Maurten gel sometime after mile 7, and my first Honey Stinger caffeinated gel sometime after mile 12. 

## Control Through the (Newton) Hills (Miles 17-21)

After the steep downhill on Mile 16, we entered Newton and shortly after I encountered the first of the four hills and started the climb. The hills were no joke; while they were short in distance, they were quite steep. After climbing the first two hills, I realized I had a problem on my hands: my legs were not bouncing back on the downhills afterwards. The climbs was harder than I was expecting, and I was losing a lot of time on the hills. As mentioned earlier, I had to cut out hill repeats to mitigate injury risks. But now this was coming home to roost, and not in a great way. Finally, I was feeling the heat from the sun, despite my best efforts to take water from aid stations and toss it on myself every mile. Altogether, the heat and my undertrained legs meant I was putting in a lot more effort than usual when climbing the hills. Things were starting to look dire for me. Race Screen went from a 2:52 prediction to a 2:54 prediction and it was now showing a 2:56 prediction.

Quickly pulling myself together, I assessed my A, B, and C goals. I quickly realized that my A and B goals were quickly slipping away and that this was not the day to go after them. I only had my C goal left. The week before the race, I rehearsed this scenario in my mind in the event I found myself in a situation like this, and this was now the moment I had to make an important decision. Whatever decision I chose to make at this pivotal moment, and whether it was the right or the wrong decision, it was one that I‚Äôd have to live with for the rest of my life. That said, it was an easy decision for me to make; being an experienced marathoner (Boston was my 20th marathon), I was aware of my own limitations and I leaned on lessons learned from similar situations I encountered in my previous marathons. If everything went off the rails, I was going to do everything I could to make it across the finish line under 3 hours. The alternative would be far worse: pushing myself beyond my physical limits would result in cramping, being reduced to a run/walk during the last few miles, resulting in an outcome that I was probably not going to be happy with.

I made the decision to hang on and aim to cross the finish line just under 3 hours. There was no going back now.

The last two hills took forever, but finally I saw the banner for Heartbreak Hill ahead of me as I began to climb it. Slowly but surely, I crested Heartbreak Hill, and a downhill greeted me on the other end. *Finally, I was completely out of the woods. Less than 5 miles to go*. The crowds on the Newton hills made it slightly bearable, but it was still a bit more suffering than I‚Äôd like.

I took one gel on this stretch, but my stomach was starting to feel somewhat queasy, so I took small sips of water and Gatorade and gently coaxed my stomach.

## (Trying to) Conquer the Final Stretch (Miles 21-26.2)

Coming out of Heartbreak Hill, I tried to get my legs going on the downhill portions over the next few miles. But my legs took a massive pounding on those hills, and now I was feeling it in my quads and calves. And I was at higher risk of cramping because of fatigue. I kept going and did my best to hold it together. During this stretch, I took a couple of brief walk breaks around the aid stations to gather myself and make sure I had enough in me for the final push towards the end. Race Screen showed that I was on track to finish in the mid-2:58s, then it started to slip towards the low 2:59s. It became clear to me that all I had to do was to hang on and I would be able to finish Boston with a sub-3 hour result.

I ran through Cleveland Circle (and dodging the train tracks there) and started to pick off an increasing number of runners who were now reduced to jogging or walking on the roads. I slowly counted off the remaining miles and did my best to keep myself mentally motivated, telling myself that I was getting close to the finish. Sometime after mile 24, I saw the Citgo sign ahead and knew that mile 25 (and the ‚Äúone mile left‚Äù mark) was coming up, and I focused on the Citgo sign as it got closer. I held myself back as I gingerly navigated the final overpass on the course, then picked it up on the other end as I approached Kenmore Square, then through the ‚Äúone mile to go‚Äù mark. Crowds were very thick in the final mile, and they were cheering us on throughout the rest of the way as we got closer to the finish line.

After navigating the final underpass and emerging on the other end, I saw a right turn just ahead. This was it. *Right onto Hereford, left onto Boylston*. I played this scene many times in my head, and now I was going to do the thing for the very first time in my life. 

Right onto Hereford, then a (wide) left onto Boylston shortly after, I saw the finish line ahead of me. *I was going to finish the Boston freaking Marathon!*. I looked at my watch and Race Screen told me I was just going to finish a touch above 2:59; barring any unforeseen circumstances, I was going to come through the finish line in just under 3 hours, achieving my C goal. I began to celebrate while running down Boylston, taking in the crowds, waving my arms and engaging with the crowds. A wide left turn onto Boylston got the attention of one of the official race photographers who was posted there, and they got some good shots of me starting my celebrations. The crowds were incredibly unreal cheering for us runners as we approached the finish line. 

As I approached the finish line, I smiled big and put my arms up in triumph, knowing that I had one job and I got it done. After working so hard to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon, this was the moment I was waiting for.

I crossed the finish line in 2:59 and change, fulfilling my dreams of racing and finishing the Boston Marathon.

Upon crossing the finish line, I became a Six Star Finisher, fulfilling my dreams of becoming a Six Star Finisher and capping off this journey that took six and a half years to complete.

The Boston Marathon was my 20th marathon that I completed overall, and it marks the ninth U.S. state that I completed a marathon in.

My sub-3 hour marathon streak remained intact (it is up to 9 in a row post-Boston). And I lived to fight another day.

### Post-race
 
After crossing the finish line, I took in a moment to soak in the atmosphere at the finish line. *Holy crap I finished the Boston freaking Marathon!* This moment was nothing like any other finish line experience that I had. Finishing a marathon is one thing, but finishing a prestigious race with a storied history is a whole different feeling.
 
I slowly hobbled my way forward through the finishers chute and I received my finishers medal first, followed by my post-race recovery bag. Volunteers there were cheering us on and congratulating us for a job well done. I ran into a few running friends who finished around the same time as I did, and we made small talk about our races while slowly walking down the finishers chute together. We approached the Six Star medals tent, and my running friends witnessed me receiving my Six Star Finishers medal. It was a very emotional and moving moment for all of us. Afterwards, we went our separate ways, and I eventually found my parents at the family reunion area. That evening, I had dinner with my parents and afterwards I went out to celebrate with a few running friends at the local bars.
 
I spent the following day taking it easy and walking around Boston and taking pictures with my medals (the Six Star medal plus the medals from the other major marathons). Wearing the Six Star medal on its own drew a lot more attention from the public than I was expecting; a lot of people came up to me to congratulate me on achieving this accomplishment. I talked to a few of those people who congratulated me and quite a few of them were also pursuing the Six Star Finishers goal as well. 
 
### Final Thoughts
 
This was the first time in a long time that I had no regrets post-race or wondered whether I could have done things quite differently during the race. The experience running the Boston Marathon for the very first time is so magical and unlike anything you ever experienced, and I made sure to take it all in and completely enjoy it, knowing that I can only experience being a first-time participant at Boston once in my lifetime and I did not want to lose sight of it. I reminded myself about this even when I was struggling coming out of the Newton hills and running the remaining miles towards the finish line. And of course, the right turn onto Hereford and left turn onto Boylston and marching down to the finish from there while the crowds were cheering their heads off was incredible and out of this world. I felt very content and completely at peace after I raced at Boston, knowing that this concludes a chapter in my running career (one where I focused on qualifying, making it into Boston, and running the Boston Marathon itself. I look forward to a new chapter in my (amateur) running career and focus on other goals, whatever that might look like.
 
And to top it off, I am officially a Six Star Finisher, with sub-3 marathon results from all the major marathons!
 
That said, the Boston course is difficult, and the rolling hills were no joke (especially after the pounding from the downhills during the first half), and I'm still feeling residual effects of it while writing this. If I were to do things differently when training for Boston next time around, I would probably do 1) start the training cycle 100% healthy and 2) do more hill work if I wasn‚Äôt rehabbing existing injuries and being cautious with the workouts that I was doing. Looking back, the difficulty of the Boston course itself was both a perfect metaphor for qualifying for Boston itself  and my own Six Star journey: it was not easy and there were times I had to overcome numerous disappointments and challenges along the way. Similar to the commitment and hard work that I had to put in to qualify for and make it into Boston, it turned out that Boston served as my final challenge that I had to overcome for me to earn my Six Star Medal; I had to rightfully earn it through hard work, blood, sweat, and tears. I smile as I realized the metaphor while writing this race report. The universe works in funny ways sometimes.

I will come back and race the Boston Marathon again someday, but for the time being I don‚Äôt feel the urge to try and requalify for Boston so soon, especially after fully experiencing Boston for the first time and I am still riding the high from it. I also don‚Äôt have a qualifying time for next year‚Äôs race, and it looks like [it is shaping up to be high cutoffs this year](https://runningwithrock.com/boston-marathon-cutoff-time-tracker/). It is very likely that the BAA is going to make the time qualifying standards sometime after the application period window closes in the fall; it is probably a good idea for me to wait and let the chaos around that settle down a bit before I start to think about next steps.
 
The Boston Marathon experience exceeded all expectations I had, and I saw firsthand why it has such a storied and legendary reputation. It was an incredible and amazing experience that was well worth waiting for, especially for someone who qualified and missed the cutoffs on their first attempt and successfully made it in on their second attempt. As someone who started marathoning at the back of the pack (I finished my first marathon in the low 5-hour range), it still blows my mind that I made huge improvements over the years and eventually was able to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon. (Big) dreams do really come true after all. For those out there that are grinding out there to qualify and make it into the Boston Marathon: dedication, persistence, and consistency will take you far, and you‚Äôll find a way to make it in one day (whether you do so as a time qualifier or as a charity runner). And it will be well worth it when you finally make it in and race it.
 
Thank you, Boston, for everything. I will never forget this for the rest of my life.

* Rechargeable battery powered fans are an option, but I'm having a hard time finding something of quality, and I imagine that recharging them would be a nightly chore.

Some of you asked for an update about me meeting my friend. 

The meeting was yesterday and it went better than I imagined. 
We had to meet after I finish my shift and through all day I felt a little mixed emotions. I didn‚Äôt know how she would react when she sees me. 
‚ÄúAna‚Äù and her scheduled the place and time to meet all of us, and when I went there they were already talking and greeting each other. I told myself that no matter what, I will give Linda a warm and long hug, and after that if I feel her uncomforted  I will take a step back. 

She hugged me back and at first, it felt good but a little strange, like I am hugging an unknown person, but after some seconds it felt like I am hugging the Linda I know. 

We walked just a little until we decided where to sit for coffee, and I didn‚Äôt want to ask anything about what she‚Äôve been going through, I wanted our ‚Äúfirst‚Äù meet to be filled with laughs and good memories. 
Ana didn‚Äôt ask her either, we went straight to being our teenage selfs, being silly and mocking each other (of course in a good way). 

Linda at first felt a little uncomfortable because I know she felt guilty about how things ended between us without an explanation, without saying goodbye, without any reason, but, when she saw us being completely ourselves like we used to be when she left us, she started opening up, being more comfortable and laughing with us. 

I didn‚Äôt want to sound like I don‚Äôt care about her life at all, so I asked if she is working, how her son is and things like this in general, and when she started to openly talk she was on the verge of tears, but didn‚Äôt cry. 

I feel like she felt like she ‚Äúowes‚Äù us an explanation on what happened with her life, what she‚Äôve been through, but I told her ‚Äúlet‚Äôs make today only about good things, whatever happened to you is now gone, and I know you are so strong, and so loved and supported, and I know you are in a better place than you were, and all I care about is this, seeing you good‚Äù.

She told us a glimpse of what she‚Äôve been through, how she was obligated to sneaky leave just with the clothes she was wearing, some things for her son and her aunt that lived in the same state took her and opened her home for Linda and her son. She did a restraining order and told the police she had to leave because of the physically & verbally abuse, so she could take full custody of her son. She won the case and asked for her son to meet her father only supervised by authorities.  

She was really struggling to find a place of her own and had to live with her aunt for a while, until she found a small apartment near her and moved there. She found a retail job part time, and since then Linda and her son are living together. 

I asked how her ex died, and she said she don‚Äôt know because she was fully no contact with him and her in laws, changed her number, got out of all social media and until an unknown number called to tell her he is dead, she didn‚Äôt have an idea. They said that he died from heart attack, but that‚Äôs all she knows about his death, she also didn‚Äôt believe her ex sis in law when she called to inform her about his death, Linda said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bother me‚Äù and hung up. 

After a while the news was confirmed and she believed that he actually died and of course she was devastated. 

Her telling the story got me teared up and I told her that the most important thing is that she is doing better, and to never ever look back on the past, just in the future. 

We then changed the subject and talked about old times, joked, laughed, just like back in the time. Our third best friend came later but still managed to spend time together all of us, like nothing has changed. 

My house and her parents house are nearby and we drove together at our town and I said I would like to meet her son just for a few minutes outside the door, just so I could hug him and go. 

We went, and her grandmother, her mother, her whole family were out, hugging me and inviting me over. Her son hugged me, he was a little bit shy, but I didn‚Äôt like to push him to be closer so I just hugged him, and let him be. 

I went inside just for 5 mins but ended staying almost 40 min, talking with her family, laughing, telling old stories, it felt just like when we used to hang out back then. 

After that Linda dropped me home and she had to leave first thing in the morning. She said she‚Äôll be back during summer and we‚Äôll definitely meet, I told her she can call me whenever she wants. 

We hugged, said goodbye and that‚Äôs the whole story. 

I felt so happy, I felt like she needed this so much, as much as we did, and I am so glad we are again in touch.

I recently noticed that most people can‚Äôt focus not because they‚Äôre lazy, but because they‚Äôve never trained for it. The brain is like a muscle. If you‚Äôve spent many of the years being overstimulated by your phone, notifications, and junk content, of course it‚Äôs weak.but  the good news is? You can rebuild focus with the right habits and mindset.

 why are you struggling to focus??
You‚Äôve conditioned your brain to always chase instant dopamine. Every time you scroll instead of staying present, you reinforce distraction. Like lifting weights, focusing is uncomfortable at first but every time you resist distraction, you‚Äôre building mental strength. That‚Äôs it.

 5 Proven Habits to Boost Energy & Focus
Cold showers in the morning, this elevate dopamine and waking up your nervous system.


Get early sunlight,  setting your body‚Äôs natural clock and boost alertness.


Wait 90 minutes for coffee to supports natural wake-up hormones and avoids afternoon crashes.


Stop doom scrolling because phones are dopamine traps; use screen-time apps to stay in control when possible.


Practice deep breathing, this is quick way to calm your mind and stay sharp throughout the day.


How to Actually Train Focus
Work in 90-minute deep focus blocks, max 2to3 per day.


During breaks, move your body and avoid stimulation (walk, stretch, clean).


The pain of focusing is a sign you‚Äôre training the right part of your brain, lean into it.


Timing Matters alot
Your brain‚Äôs strongest in the first 8 hours after waking, especially the first 2 hours. Do your most important work then. Don‚Äôt waste that window on email or social media.

 Pro Tip: Find Work That Feels Like Play
You‚Äôll focus longer (and better) on work you enjoy. Follow your curiosity, explore what excited you as a kid, and build around that.

Goodluck, hope this will be of help to some.

1kcc50y,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1kcc50y/the_magic_of_you/,the magic of you,"hiiiiii my sweetest human,

i don‚Äôt even know where to start because my heart is just so full of you right now. it‚Äôs like you live in every little beat, every breath, every silly smile that sneaks onto my face when i think about you‚Äîwhich, let‚Äôs be honest, is basically all the time. you‚Äôve taken over my whole world in the gentlest, most beautiful way, and i wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

you make life feel like this cozy, warm dream i never wanna wake up from. even on my messiest, most chaotic days, you‚Äôre the calm in the middle of it all. you‚Äôre the soft voice in my mind that says ‚Äúhey, it‚Äôs gonna be okay,‚Äù and somehow, when it‚Äôs coming from you, i believe it. you‚Äôve got this way of grounding me without ever making me feel small. instead, you lift me up without even trying.

you make everything sweeter. coffee tastes better when you‚Äôre around. sunsets look prettier. songs sound deeper. it‚Äôs like loving you has turned up the color and volume on life itself, and now everything just feels more real. more alive. and don‚Äôt even get me started on the way you look when you‚Äôre just being you‚Äîno effort, no filter, just you. it wrecks me in the best way.

i‚Äôm so in love with your brain. the way you think, the little things you notice, the stuff that makes you laugh when no one else gets the joke. i love how you get passionate about random things and suddenly you‚Äôre just this little ball of excitement and wonder. it‚Äôs the cutest thing. i could listen to you talk forever. seriously. even if you were reading the back of a cereal box, i‚Äôd still be hooked.

you‚Äôve made me softer in all the right ways. more patient, more open, more hopeful. i look at you and i see everything good in the world wrapped up into one human. you are kindness. you are safety. you are light. and i still can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre mine. like, out of everyone in the world, you chose me. that still blows my mind on a daily basis.

i just want you to know that i‚Äôm here. through everything. through happy days and hard ones. through late-night overthinking and early morning cuddles. i‚Äôve got you. always. and i don‚Äôt just want to be with you, i want to grow with you. i want to learn you like a favorite book i‚Äôll never get tired of rereading. i want to keep choosing you every day in new ways.

you are my heart‚Äôs favorite place to be. i love you endlessly.

forever your fan.

1kcc4po,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1kcc4po/a_17yearold_girl_was_raped_outside_a_hospital_in/,A 17-year-old girl was raped outside a hospital in Finland and the rape charges were dropped. The men were in their thirties. I hate it here,"So: a 17-yo girl was drunk (2.05 promilles) and taken to the hospital for her inebriation. There, three men (two in their thirties, one born 2006) from the hospital lobby, WHO THE GIRL DIDN'T KNOW, took her to the bushes by the hospital and raped her orally, vaginally and anally. The girl told a security officer at the hospital. The men were later caught. All charges were dropped since, apparently, the judge thought that she probably concented since she walked out herself and was seen buying coffee at the lobby?

I'm so goddamn sick of this country's justice system when it comes to rape. The perpetrators get a slap on the wrist if anything at all. If this case doesn't fill all the markers of rape, then what does??? When will we be believed?? This is infuriating.

To start, I'm 32 years old (also just had blood work and my thyroid is great) my cycle this go round was 45 days and I finally started 3 days ago. Was heavy for 1 day now just spotting with clots in between, like why can't  I  just have one or the other?lol. At first I felt relief physically having my period and now? who even am I? I'm angry and crying over the smallest things. My anxiety is through the roof and I feel like something terrible is about to happen. 
Went to Sephora and couldn't  use my coupon which was the only reason why I went, bought what I wanted at full price because I didn't want to waste my time. Had tears in my eyes when I got to the car, like why? I had to sit and take deep breaths like girl, chill. It's just makeup.
Decided to go to Starbucks to get my kids a Cake pop and I prayed.. please if they mess up my coffee I just might cry an Uncle Ben cry. Now I have a headache and very nauseated from all of these rollercoaster of emotions. I feel like a toddler with these emotions of I'm losing it and a moment later things are great lol.

Since a few months I am single and he asked my brother if I would like to join him for a wedding as a dance partner. It showed he perhaps he has little interest left in me. I agreed. We are both 35, the wedding was 1 week ago. This was also the very first time that we met in person, he liked me from pictures and was curious who I am (I think). He is single since 2 years.

We weren't writing much, but literally met in the wedding. We had a great time but I don't know if he likes me or not! He was dancing a lot with me, at times he held my hand (it was a moment), I can feel he is attracted to me but he also has not really looked for a moment to have 1:1 conversation with me. We were all the time in groups of people. His friends kept saying how great we look together and kind of telling him in front of me to take me for date, which he has not commented on, but smiled to in a nice way. 

I am very confused. He messaged me to thank me after the wedding, but he does not keep messaging me anymore.

I am going through divorce (he knows), and i start to think that either: i am to old for him? (He wants younger girlfriend?), or he keeps distance because he is friends with my brother?

I was hoping we could meet again, I really like him. But maybe he wants for me to message him? I have not either.

Question: would you message him to ask how is he and ask if he would like to grab a coffee together once? 

Honestly, this would be first time in my life i would ask the guy out myself.. and I am afraid, he will reject me, especially given the fact that he knows my brother and probably everyone would know i asked him out. My brother tells me to not do that but I also don't want to have any regrets. Just dont know if that would be appropriate.

Any advice will be much appreciated.

In terms of podcast genre, this particular club would be geared toward topics around personal development, social psychology, life fulfillment, philosophy, human nature, and the like. I want to start with episodes from Modern Wisdom, but would also love to learn what other podcasts people are listening to that fall into these genres. 

I‚Äôm going to start a WhatsApp group where I‚Äôll go into greater detail about what I‚Äôm envisioning for the club! Comment if you‚Äôre interested in joining and I‚Äôll DM you (: ",1,1746114308.0,Greenpoint,0,0.66,False

I was walking out of a grocery store when I saw a woman in her late 30s pull into a clearly marked disabled parking spot. No placard, no tag. She hopped out of her SUV in workout clothes and headed straight inside. Not limping, not helping anyone  just grabbing a coffee from the instore caf√©.

An older man in a wheelchair who had been waiting nearby politely asked if she had a permit. She laughed and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be five minutes, relax.‚Äù Then she looked at him and said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you have something better to do than police people?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond. Just turned away and wheeled off.

It was disgusting.

The worst part? Her gym had its name printed in bold on the back of her hoodie. I Googled it. It took less than a minute to find the location and the name of the owner which I‚Äôm pretty sure is her, based on the gym‚Äôs website.

So here I am I have the name of her business. I have the time and location of what happened. I could easily email her business partners or post a public review. I‚Äôm not out for revenge‚Ä¶ but I keep thinking about that older guy, humiliated for just asking someone to follow the rules meant to protect people like him.

I haven‚Äôt reported it. Maybe she was just having a bad day. Maybe calling her out could cost her more than it‚Äôs worth.

But if you‚Äôre the face of a business in a small community and you publicly mock a disabled person in front of others,should that just slide?

Would you report it? Or walk away?
TL;DR:
I saw a woman (likely a local gym owner) park in a disabled spot without a permit, then mock an older man in a wheelchair who politely called her out. She was wearing branded gym merch, so I easily found her business. I‚Äôm torn between reporting her and just letting it go was it worth escalating, or should I have minded my own business?

1kcbtf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kcbtf7/after_i_lost_my_family_i_started_taking_theirs/,"After I Lost My Family, I Started Taking Theirs","   Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1746113980.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

1kcbsm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kcbsm2/uncover_the_kismile_espresso_machine_review_is_it/,Uncover the Kismile Espresso Machine review Is it the right choice?,"The Kismile KS-CM8032S-New Espresso Machine has been part of my daily caffeine routine for a few weeks now, and despite some quirks, it has significantly upgraded my coffee experience. As someone who loves a strong espresso but doesn‚Äôt fancy complicated setups, this machine has impressed me on multiple fronts. Let me walk you through its features, performance, and my first-hand experiences using it.

**Compact and Stylish Design**  
Right out of the box, the sleek stainless-steel design immediately caught my eye. It looks modern without being flashy, blending nicely with my kitchen‚Äôs aesthetic. Its compact footprint‚Äînarrow and rectangular‚Äîfits easily in tight spaces. Measuring only 11.7 inches in depth and 5.12 inches in width, this espresso machine is ideal for anyone dealing with limited counter space. Even my sister, whose kitchen is more cluttered than a thrift store, managed to place it neatly without complaints.

**Brewing Performance**  
This 20-bar pressure espresso machine lives up to its promise of delivering rich and aromatic coffee. The 1350W motor gets the job done fast, extracting full-bodied flavors with a layer of crema that could rival coffee from your local caf√©. I‚Äôve tried brewing a single cup for a quick morning fix and a double espresso when entertaining guests‚Äîboth delivered consistent results every time. What sold me was the speed; it takes about a minute to preheat and only 15 to 25 seconds per espresso. For someone always late to work, that‚Äôs a godsend.  

**Self-Cleaning Functionality**  
Maintaining this machine is a breeze, thanks to its built-in auto-cleaning feature. After about 500 uses, the machine signals cleaning time by flashing all four indicator lights‚Äîhelpful for folks like me who tend to forget maintenance schedules. Once cleaned, it‚Äôs back to brewing like new. However, the manual cleaning instructions could have been a tad clearer.

**Check [Kismile KS-CM8032S-New](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dpgh19bv/) price on Amazon.**

**Powerful Steam Wand**  
If you‚Äôre a fan of lattes or cappuccinos, the steam wand on this machine is something to rave about. It‚Äôs powerful enough to create velvety milk froth in seconds. My coworker, a self-proclaimed latte art enthusiast, couldn‚Äôt stop experimenting with different designs during a weekend hangout. However, the steam wand‚Äôs intensity takes some getting used to; the learning curve might be steep for someone completely new to espresso machines.

**User Interface and Options**  
Being semi-automatic, it strikes a balance between user control and automation. The button controls are straightforward, but their small size can be a minor annoyance, especially for someone like me with clumsy fingers. Adjustments such as customizing water output for shots make it versatile, although I wish the tamper included in the package had been of higher quality. I eventually swapped it out for a sturdier off-market one.

**Advantages**  
- Sleek and compact stainless-steel design.  
- 20-bar pressure delivers barista-quality espresso with excellent crema.  
- Powerful steam wand for effortless frothing.  
- Self-cleaning function simplifies maintenance.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The buttons are tiny and not as intuitive as they could be.  
- Lightweight design might raise durability concerns over time.  
- Included tamper feels flimsy; a better quality tamper would improve usability.  

**Competing Products**  
I previously owned a high-end espresso machine, and while it felt like a tank, it lacked the simplicity this Kismile model offers. Compared to brands like Breville or DeLonghi, which usually come with more robust builds and advanced features, this machine focuses on delivering everyday essentials. A noteworthy rival, DeLonghi EC680M Dedica, excels in durability and customizability, but it comes at nearly double the price. The Kismile espresso machine may not be the most heavy-duty option, but for its cost, it hits the sweet spot between affordability and performance.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
In the world of coffee machines, you often get what you pay for, and yet, this espresso machine surprises with how much value it offers for its price. It‚Äôs affordable without compromising on key features like a robust pressure system or quick brewing capabilities. If you‚Äôre on a budget and want to dive into the world of espresso without shelling out a fortune, this is an excellent entry-level choice. However, those willing to invest a bit more might find premium options better suited to long-term, heavy-duty use.

**Guest experience:**

**9:30-11:30am:** Gorgeous garden venue with a view. Ceremony will be from approx 10-10:45am, with time afterwards for photos and mingling.

**11:30-12:00pm:** Transport to the restaurant, 15 mins away on a bad day. We have a private patio area, with an open bar, that continues the garden theme - it is overgrown with trees. The food here is also divine.

**12:00-12:45pm:** Cocktail hour

**12:45-2:30pm:** Long lunch, with speeches after appetizers come out

**2:30-3:30pm:** Games at the table, MC'd by my hilarious sister

**3:30-4:30/5pm:** Cake, coffee, and goodbyes

25-30 people, everyone will be seated at a U-shaped table, no dancing.

After this, the groom and I are gonna run off for a golden hour photoshoot around the city, and then take the rest of the evening off. We'll do activities with both of our immediate families the next day. 

So like, you know when your family or friends happen to gather for something, and the event just gets that certain *magical* quality to it, even though it's mostly just people sitting around? Something is just activated, in the air, people are just like... on, and happy? I'm wondering how to sort of... *induce* that feeling, that comfortability. 

My ideas include myself and the groom giving a long, funny, and heartfelt speech that we can really personalize for the small group, and playing table games (like the shoe one, or any of the ones you might see at a bridal shower). 

Beyond that, idk. In my culture it's common to do very loud, over-the-top, boisterous weddings with 200+ people and dancing until 2am. 

I feel like a black sheep for not doing the done thing so I'm losing sleep at night trying to figure out ways to make sure it has that \*intimate magic\* that those more typical weddings just can't have. I really don't want to regret not just sucking it up and having a big wedding. 

I also worry that people will spend the majority of their time just stuck in their micro-groups since they'll be seated for everything - I'm not sure how to circumvent that and encourage them to mingle with other people at the ceremony area and during cocktail hour.

1kcbrm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1kcbrm2/explore_the_graco_snugrider_elite_review_is_it/,Explore the Graco SnugRider Elite Review Is It the Best Baby Stroller?,"Testing out the Graco 1934883 SnugRider Elite Car Seat Carrier has been an enlightening journey. As a parent always on the move, I needed something lightweight, easy to handle, and sturdy enough to support my wiggly little one. Designed to accept all Graco SnugRide infant car seats, this carrier has made navigating day-to-day life significantly more manageable. However, while it has a lot going for it, there are a few quirks worth considering based on my experience.

**Build Quality and Design**

The first thing that struck me was how lightweight this product is. The aluminum frame feels solid but doesn't burden you, which was a huge relief for my already tired arms. Everything about the design seems catered to practicality, from the discreet black color to the adjustable handle for effortless strolling. I particularly appreciated the fabric‚Äîpolyester‚Äîoffering a balance of durability and comfort for those inevitable messes that parents deal with.

For added convenience, its folded size of 10.5 x 31.5 x 19.4 inches makes storage a breeze. I could fit it in my small car trunk without playing luggage Tetris. However, I did notice the frame occasionally felt a bit wobbly when hitting bumps on rougher terrain, which could be slightly nerve-wracking.

**Ease of Use**

Setting up this carrier felt pretty intuitive. It was a one-hand-click mechanism to attach my Graco SnugRide infant car seat, and it fit like a glove. The standing fold feature with an automatic storage lock was a lifesaver during errands. Imagine standing in a chaotic parking lot trying to juggle a baby, groceries, and a stroller‚Äîthis design makes it less of a headache. Bonus points for not having to bend uncomfortably to fold it up.

**Check [Graco 1934883 SnugRider Elite Car Seat Carrier] price on Amazon.**

However, while the ease of collapse is convenient, getting it open sometimes required a little more finesse than I anticipated. You‚Äôd think one smooth snap and it‚Äôd pop open‚Äîbut no, it occasionally refused to cooperate on the first try. Maybe that‚Äôs something you get used to with continued use.

**Travel-Worthy Features**

This carrier gets high marks for its travel compatibility. Meeting Disney Park size requirements was a surprising bonus, as I didn‚Äôt want to lug around an unapproved accessory while on vacation. The all-wheel suspension was super helpful for maneuverability‚Äîwhether I was in the mall or on uneven footpaths, it moved pretty smoothly.

That said, I did feel the plastic wheels lacked a bit of durability for long outdoor strolls. They‚Äôre great for short errands, but I started to notice some wear when used on gravel paths. If you‚Äôre all about long walks, you might need something more rugged.

**Highlights**

- Lightweight yet sturdy aluminum frame  
- Simple one-hand folding mechanism  
- Adjustable handle height for ergonomic comfort  
- Large storage basket for travel essentials  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Plastic wheels are not as durable for rugged use  
- Opening the carrier occasionally takes extra effort  

**Storage and Accessories**

Parents know the struggles of hauling around baby gear, snacks, and a thousand other things just in case. The under-carriage storage basket on this model is downright spacious, and the zippered pocket adds an extra layer of security for valuables like car keys and phones. There‚Äôs even a parent tray with two cup holders‚Äîhaving a spot for my iced coffee and the baby bottle felt like a small luxury. These thoughtful extras made every outing feel a bit more organized.

The only hiccup here was that the storage basket felt slightly difficult to reach when the car seat was clicked in. It wasn‚Äôt a deal-breaker, just a moment of frustration when wrestling with large diaper bags.

**Challengers**

Comparing this product to others in the market like the Chicco Caddy Stroller Frame, some differences stood out. While the Graco offers better compatibility for their own car seats with a seamless and secure design, Chicco has an edge with slightly better wheel durability. However, it lacks the adjustable handle height that made the Graco ideal for both me (shorter) and my taller partner to use.

Another close competitor, the Baby Trend Snap-N-Go EX Carrier, felt a bit flimsier than the Graco. Though lighter by about two pounds, that weight-saving didn‚Äôt feel worth it when sacrificing the sturdier aluminum frame of the Graco model.

**Value Proposition**

Taking into account the features and convenience offered here, this stroller seems like a solid pick if your family already uses Graco car seats. Instead of investing in a bulky travel system, this provides an affordable, well-rounded solution. Its lightweight frame and all the additional perks like storage and cup holders add to its appeal.

For the cost, the functionality seems fair. While some improvements to the wheels and folding mechanism could make it flawless, its practicality makes it worth considering. If you're set on having an easy-to-handle, compatible travel stroller, it doesn‚Äôt disappoint.

Chapter One: Trouble in the Smoke Shop
Danny‚Äôs Smoke Shop sat on a busy Brooklyn corner, a small place filled with the smell of cigars and worry. Danny and his girlfriend, Diane, were in a mess. The ghost of Paulie ‚ÄúWaldo‚Äù Mayes‚ÄîDanny‚Äôs old best friend and business partner‚Äîwas haunting them. Waldo died thinking Danny cheated him out of a pile of money, and now his angry spirit wouldn‚Äôt rest. He was messing with Danny‚Äôs sleep, spooking Diane, and draining their savings. Waldo wanted revenge, and he wouldn‚Äôt stop until Danny lost everything, including Diane.
Out of options, Danny and Diane flipped through the Village Voice classifieds and found an ad for Julius Q. Bygone, Supernatural Sleuth of Shadows. The ad promised he could see spirits, read minds, talk to angels, and wrestle ghosts. It sounded wild, but they were desperate. They called him up, hoping he could fix their ghost problem.

Here‚Äôs how it went down. Danny made a secret deal with a sketchy cigar distributor to sell untaxed ‚ÄúCuban‚Äù cigars on the side. It brought in big money, but Waldo, who liked to play by the rules, wouldn‚Äôt agree to it. So Danny, with Diane‚Äôs help, faked the shop‚Äôs books to make it look like the business was failing. They convinced Waldo to sell his half of the shop for almost nothing. He left, hurt and suspicious, but didn‚Äôt know the truth. Danny and Diane used the extra cash to grow the shop and pocketed the profits. Then Waldo found out about the scam, right before he died. Now his ghost was back, and Danny, feeling guilty, wanted to apologize and make things right so Waldo could rest in peace.

The shop‚Äôs doorbell jingled, and in walked Julius Q. Bygone. He was a tall, skinny guy, six-foot-two, dressed head to toe in brown. Brown three-piece suit, brown fedora with a little red feather, brown shoes, even a long brown raincoat. A shiny pocket watch chain hung across his vest. Julius loved brown like a kid loves candy.
‚ÄúJulius Q. Bygone!‚Äù he said, spreading his arms like a stage actor. ‚ÄúSupernatural Sleuth of Shadows! I see spirits, talk to angels, read minds, wrestle ghosts, and‚Äîoh yeah‚ÄîI can be in two places at once!‚Äù His grin was big and a little goofy, but his sharp eyes missed nothing.
Danny, leaning on the counter, looked nervous. Diane, sitting nearby, raised an eyebrow, like she wasn‚Äôt sure what to make of this guy. Julius had three sides to him: a charming show-off, a tough guy with a stare like a hawk, and a quirky oddball who did things his own way. Right now, his business self was in the shop, but his personal self was across town at a Union Square fruit stand, picking out Jazz apples. ‚ÄúGet the crisp ones,‚Äù he muttered to himself, a perk of being a bi-locator.
‚ÄúAlright, let‚Äôs get to work,‚Äù Julius said, clapping his hands. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a ghost named Waldo making trouble. You want me to talk to him, work out a deal, and help him move on. Right?‚Äù
Danny nodded fast. ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs it, Mr. Bygone. Look, Waldo was holding me back. He didn‚Äôt want to take risks to grow the business. So we had to trick him, make him think the shop was going under. I‚Äôm sorry, but it was his fault for being so stubborn. You understand, don‚Äôt you, Mr. B?‚Äù
Julius tilted his fedora, a habit when he was thinking. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs your business, not mine. I‚Äôm here to deal with the ghost. Got anything Waldo owned? I can use it to connect with him.‚Äù
Danny reached under the counter and pulled out a coffee mug with Tiparillo written on it. ‚ÄúHere ya go, Mr. B. This was Waldo‚Äôs.‚Äù
Julius took the mug, holding it like it was a magic wand. He could feel a faint buzz from it, like Waldo‚Äôs spirit was close. ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù he said, tucking it into his raincoat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll talk to Waldo tonight and see what he wants. I‚Äôll come back in the morning with news.‚Äù He gave them a big, dramatic wink. ‚ÄúWish me luck, folks. I‚Äôm off to dance with a ghost!‚Äù
With a swirl of his raincoat, Julius Q. Bygone stepped out into the Brooklyn night, vanishing into the shadows. Inside the shop, Danny and Diane exchanged a look, wondering if this strange guy could really save them from Waldo‚Äôs wrath.",1,1746113721.0,u_glac1018,0,1.0,False

Chips, soda, maybe some candy. But if that‚Äôs your only view, you're missing out on the next big wave of money-making opportunities.

2025 is seeing a boom in vending machine innovations that are making serious cash.

The best part is you don't have to work long hours behind a counter or deal with customers face-to-face.

All you need is the right product, in the right location, and you can start seeing cash flow in no time.

Let‚Äôs dive into 8 vending machine types that could end up making you more money than your full-time job.

1. **‚Äçüí® Vape Vending Machines**

Vape vending machines are popping up in places like convenience stores, malls, and nightlife venues.

They provide a discreet, easy way for customers to grab their vape products without leaving the location. With proper placement, these machines can generate steady revenue.

4. üçª Breathalyzer Vending Machines
5. üå∏ Perfume & Cologne Sprayers
6. ‚òî Umbrella Vending Machines
7. ‚òï Coffee Vending Machines

None of these are ‚Äúget rich quick.‚Äù

But with the right product in the right place, each of these can bring in daily revenue ‚Äî without you being there.

Margins are real.

I did a full year of a raw vegan diet back in 2012 and that's really the only point in my journey that I lost a lot of fat. I loved eating that way, but it's pricey and I was CONSTANTLY preparing food, so it's unsustainable in that way as well. I did a brief period of a paleo diet (non-vegan), while starting to lift weight, and had pretty good success in body recomposition, but then I injured myself and had quite a few years off of exercise. I got back into lifting two years ago and running a year ago and I'm incredibly consistent (3x per week running (around 30km per week) and 3-4x a week lifting on the days I don't run. I also walk on my lifting days. I can't say I haven't seen ANY progress, but I don't think I'm blessed in the genetics department. I've always had some muscle (I was a competitive swimmer until I was 20 years old), but I've always had a good layer of fat on top. Gained quite a bit of weight at university and was probably 80kgs, but then lost it when I developed some allergies and couldn't eat myself to death anymore. 

My struggle with food for at least the last five years is that I feel like I eat pretty well (could be fully unprocessed, sure, but I believe in having some treats and I have a sweet tooth), but I don't really see drastic changes. I haven't gained any fat (most recent loss was going from 69kg to my current weight about a year ago), but I haven't really lost any either. I don't look bad, but I don't look like I work out as much as I do. I've tracked macros, calories, all the things, and all it does it end up making me feel STARVING. I think I'm consistently eating maintenance calories because I find that it's so hard for me to feel full on any sort of deficit. Even with maintenance calories, I find that tofu and veggies just don't fill me up. I'm a bit at a loss as to what to change to see the changes I want. Here's an average day:

Breakfast:

1 Bagel with 8g of vegan butter, coffee with 150mL of soymilk

Lunch:

1/2 Block of tofu in a kebab bread with veggies

Dinner:

1 Block of tofu with veggies

Snack:

Oat bar or protein bar (usually around 200 cal)

  
Any suggestions as to what I can change? I also do oatmeal sometimes for breakfast instead if I'm feeling guilty about the bagel. I guess I could change to smoothies or something instead (most likely I need the fruit anyway). ",1,1746113621.0,veganfitness,0,1.0,False

I suffer from insomnia, which can be very draining. I have a bed, but it‚Äôs mostly used as a second couch. I sit under the duvet with my laptop and either get some work done or mindlessly scroll through social media.

Nights, for me, are no different than days‚Äîexcept all my friends are asleep, so I can‚Äôt chat with them. I‚Äôve made friends online with people on the other side of the planet, so I can at least talk to someone at 3 a.m. when I need interaction.

After years of binge-watching TV shows and terrible movies, I‚Äôm used to doing nothing for hours at a time. I‚Äôm subscribed to far too many channels on YouTube just for the content, so spending hours looking for something to watch is nothing new.

But three weeks ago, I found a livestreamer who streams every single night.

He turns on his camera‚Ä¶ and goes to sleep.

That‚Äôs it.

He titles the stream Watch Me Sleep. And so‚ÄîI do.

I promise it‚Äôs not a sex thing‚Ä¶ for me, at least. I can‚Äôt speak for the other 38 people watching.

For me, this stream of a random man sleeping is like the food videos people watch while on a diet. It‚Äôs calming. There‚Äôs something weirdly peaceful about seeing someone else able to fall asleep.

I found myself tuning in every night.

He looks sad before bed. Every morning when he wakes up, he walks to the camera and quietly says, ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù before ending the stream.

Each night, the viewer count fluctuates‚Äîfrom high hundreds to single digits. The comments are usually the same:
‚ÄúThis is boring.‚Äù
‚ÄúDo something.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy am I watching this?‚Äù

The streamer never replies. He never changes the title. There‚Äôs no explanation for why he‚Äôs doing this‚Äîno profile bio, no socials, no backstory. The mystery of it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what pulled me in.

It started five days ago.

I was watching a movie and joined the stream late. He was already asleep by the time I clicked in.

As the video loaded, I caught something‚Äîjust for a second. A shape? A blur? A figure? I couldn‚Äôt quite tell.

I scrolled back ten seconds and replayed the moment.

Nothing.

I figured it was a glitch.

But then‚Äîfour nights ago‚ÄîI joined late again after drinks with friends.

This time, I definitely saw it.

A figure. In the dark.

It stood next to the bed, silently watching the sleeping man.

I checked the chat‚Äî16 other people were watching‚Äîbut no one mentioned it. They were talking about the dark bed cover. Or complaining about the pillows.

But no mention of him.

So I typed:

‚ÄúWho is that in the room with him?‚Äù

The replies came quickly:

STEG47: ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
LUMPYGRUMP: ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù
NIGHTWATCH: ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù
DONTTALKTOME: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt try to make this more interesting.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you not see the thing standing next to the bed?‚Äù I typed again.

HEADCASSIE: ‚ÄúHaha, good one.‚Äù
NIGHTWATCH: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not fooling anyone.‚Äù

No one believed me.

I refreshed the stream.

It was still there.

But this time‚Ä¶ it turned.

And looked at me.

SLAM.

I shut my laptop, heart pounding in my ears.

I told myself it was sleep deprivation. Hallucination. Day-nightmaring or something.

It had to be.

Three nights ago.

I joined again.

This time, I wasn‚Äôt exhausted. I hadn‚Äôt been drinking. I‚Äôd done everything ‚Äúright.‚Äù

The stream loaded.

And there it was.

The figure.

Tall. Almost human. But not quite. Like someone tried to draw a person from memory and got the proportions wrong.

It stood beside the bed.

But it wasn‚Äôt watching the sleeping man.

It was watching‚Ä¶ me.

I froze. I couldn‚Äôt move. Its eyes‚Äîif you can call them that‚Äîlocked onto mine. I swear it could see me, as clearly as I saw it.

My hands trembled. I wanted to close the laptop. I didn‚Äôt. I couldn‚Äôt.

I watched it for hours, and it watched me.

Then, it moved.

It stepped forward.

Its face filled the screen. It tilted its head‚Äîalmost curious. Maybe even‚Ä¶ fascinated.

It raised its hand.

I don‚Äôt know why I did it‚Äîbut I lifted mine too.

And when our hands met on the screen‚Ä¶

It vanished.

The next thing I knew, it was morning.

And for the first time in years‚Ä¶ I felt rested. Not a nap. Not a blackout. Not a short burst of unconsciousness.

Sleep.

I had to find him.

Warn him.

But how?

He never responded to comments. His username, WATCHMESLEEP, led to nothing‚Äîno other socials, no website.

Then I remembered something.

That backpack.

It hung by his bed. I‚Äôd seen it so many times before‚Äînever thought twice about it.

It had a college logo.

A little Googling, and less than an hour later, I‚Äôd found the school.

It wasn‚Äôt too far away.

Well‚Ä¶ for someone who doesn‚Äôt sleep, a 14-hour drive doesn‚Äôt seem too bad.

The next day

I arrived on campus.

It was huge. I had no real plan.

Just a screengrab of his face.

After hours of walking, I finally found someone who recognized him and pointed me to his dorm.

Twenty minutes later, I was knocking on his door.

It opened.

He stared at me.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Hello?‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you,‚Äù I said, stunned.

‚ÄúAnd you are?‚Äù he asked politely.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Kevin. I‚Ä¶ I watch you sleep.‚Äù

He blinked, then smiled, a little embarrassed. ‚ÄúOh. I‚Äôm Eric. And‚Ä¶ thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw something in the room with you,‚Äù I said, careful not to sound insane.

He turned, looked around his room, then back at me.

‚ÄúWhat did it do?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou believe me?‚Äù

He nodded, stepped aside, and gestured for me to come in.

Over coffee, I told him everything. He didn‚Äôt interrupt. Just listened.

When I finally finished, he let out a slow breath.

‚ÄúI appreciate you coming all this way‚Ä¶ but I already know.‚Äù

I waited.

He looked at me and finally continued.

‚ÄúIt started when I took a job watching a man sleep. He had a sleep demon attached to him. It hurt him whenever he entered the dream realm. He hired me to stay awake while he slept.

‚ÄúBut one night‚Ä¶ I fell asleep.

‚ÄúAnd the demon latched onto me.‚Äù

He rolled up his sleeves.

Scratches. Bites. Scars.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I started the livestream. As long as someone‚Äôs watching, it doesn‚Äôt hurt me.‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúThat thing you saw‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt see it. I never have.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said it‚Äôs a sleep demon?‚Äù I asked.

He nodded.

‚ÄúI suffer from insomnia. I can‚Äôt enter the dream realm.‚Äù

His eyes widened. ‚ÄúYou think‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs interested in you? Because you‚Äôre unreachable?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it wants to understand me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet me watch you sleep. If it shows itself to me on a screen, it‚Äôll show itself to me in person. Maybe we can learn something.‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúIt could hurt you. It could kill you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want to do this. If my insomnia can help someone‚Ä¶ maybe my years of torture will be worth something.‚Äù

He looked at me with a kind of sadness that hit harder than a punch.

An hour later, Eric got ready for bed.

I sat at his desk. Watching. Waiting.

He whispered, ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù as he climbed into bed.

It didn‚Äôt take long.

As soon as he drifted off, it appeared.

The figure stood by the bed.

Then turned.

Saw me.

And smiled.

It walked over.

Kneeling to meet my eye level, it tilted its head. Curious. Calculating.

It raised its hand.

And I raised mine.

We touched.

The next morning

Eric woke up and sat up slowly.

‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs gone,‚Äù he whispered, exhaling like he‚Äôd been holding his breath for years.

He turned to me.

But I was already standing.

‚ÄúDid you fall asleep?‚Äù He asked solemnly 

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said gently. 

He stared.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Your eyes,‚Äù he whispered.

‚ÄúWhat about them?‚Äù I asked, already knowing the answer.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not yours.‚Äù

I smiled.

Walked to the door.

‚ÄúGoodbye, Eric.‚Äù

As I stepped into the hallway, I heard the click of the lock behind me.

I didn‚Äôt blame him.

I placed a hand on my chest.

And whispered:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go home.‚Äù

A voice‚Äîit‚Äôs voice‚Äîanswered from deep inside me.

‚ÄúYes. Let‚Äôs.‚Äù

The Braun KF5650BK Pure Flavor Coffee Maker is a sleek addition to my kitchen counter. With its modern black exterior and compact dimensions (8.7""D x 9.3""W x 14.8""H), it fits nicely without taking up a massive amount of space. The stainless-steel accents not only elevate the aesthetics but also give it a premium feel. One thing I noticed immediately was the intuitive touch-screen display that makes programming the machine a breeze. Having tested many coffee makers in the past, the ease of setting up the 24-hour programmable timer feels like a win, especially on those mornings when leaving the house in a rush is the standard routine.

[Check Braun KF5650BK price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b096tycrzv/)

**Brew Variety at Your Fingertips**

The standout feature of this coffee maker has to be its BrewChoice Plus function. Whether I‚Äôm craving a fast brew, a bold cup, or something lighter for the afternoon, the machine offers flexibility to match my coffee mood. There's even an over-ice brew option, which retains the coffee‚Äôs boldness without delivering a watered-down result‚Äîa game-changer during summer months. Testing all these brew styles provided consistent flavors across the spectrum. The built-in brewing signal is another thoughtful touch, politely alerting me when the coffee is ready, sparing me from hovering around the kitchen waiting for the first heavenly drop.

**Efficient Brewing Performance**

In terms of performance, the Fast Brew technology stands out, delivering a full 14-cup carafe in 20% less time compared to some older models I‚Äôve tried. As someone who hosts frequent brunches with friends, the ability to churn out coffee quickly is an absolute lifesaver. The unique stainless-steel FlavorCarafe is particularly worth mentioning‚Äîit keeps the coffee warm without sacrificing taste. Even two hours after brewing, my cup still had that fresh, aromatic flavor. 

**Upsides**

- Flexible brewing options (fast, regular, bold, over ice).
- Larger capacity of 14 cups, perfect for entertaining or heavy coffee consumption.
- Easy-to-navigate touch-screen display.
  
**Convenient Cleaning and Maintenance**

Cleaning coffee makers can sometimes feel unnecessarily tedious, but this model simplifies the process with removable, dishwasher-safe components. The auto descaling notification is another nice touch, ensuring the coffee maker stays in peak condition without relying on me to keep track. As someone who has ruined machines in the past by neglecting to descale, I appreciate this feature more than I‚Äôd like to admit.

**Limitations**

- The touch display, although intuitive, can be unresponsive if your hands are even slightly damp, which is a minor inconvenience during morning rushes.
- The automated descaling signal could be a tad aggressive‚Äîit went off much sooner than I expected, despite using filtered water most of the time.
  
**Drawbacks**

- Slight delay in touch controls if moisture is present.
- Descaling alert feels overly sensitive.
- With extensive features, there‚Äôs a slight learning curve on the first use.

**Steady Temperature for a Long-Lasting Warmth**

The SteadyTemp Warming Plate is another feature I found surprisingly handy. Typically, coffee plates can overheat the brew, gradually burning the taste. However, this machine allows customizable temperature settings (low, medium, or high), keeping the coffee warm for up to four hours without ruining the flavor. Whether I was working late or sneaking a cup after lunch, the coffee always tasted like it had just been brewed.

**Market Rivals**

Comparing this coffee maker to competing products like the Cuisinart SS-15 or the Keurig K-Duo Plus, it excels in offering a higher number of brew options with a speedier brewing process. The Cuisinart model does offer a dual brewing system (pods and ground coffee), but I found the taste consistency of this machine better overall. The Keurig K-Duo Plus leans towards convenience with pods, yet it doesn‚Äôt match the rich flavor the Braun‚Äôs FlavorCarafe preserves.

**True Value**

When considering this coffee maker's price, it feels like an investment in convenience, flavor retention, and aesthetics. It‚Äôs not the most budget-friendly option out there, but for a 14-cup coffee maker with programmable features and standout brewing choices, it offers a lot for what you pay. Personally, I think it‚Äôs worth every penny if you‚Äôre a serious coffee drinker looking for durability and versatility.

1kcbj88,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kcbj88/hospital_floor_c/,Hospital Floor C,"I have been working as a crematorium operator for 8 years, coming up in July. I stumbled into this profession accidentally when working at a hospital as a patient transporter. My job then was just to take patients from point A to point B.¬†



Being a patient transporter is not a bad gig. Most people come along just fine; however, some don‚Äôt. The elderly who have been burdened by memory loss usually take some convincing. But the worst are the mentally unstable patients. When these people pop up from time to time, they can throw the entire schedule off.¬†



I‚Äôm a pretty tall and well-built guy. No six pack, but I regularly go to the gym and try to eat right. I was often called in when there were rowdy patients who needed transporting, due to my physical appearance.¬†



I‚Äôve spent time trying to convince a man that the doctor was not trying to put eels in his brain so he could hear his thoughts, and having to physically restrain a woman from smashing a flower pot into the back of someone's head. I‚Äôve dealt with the sweetest people and people who do nothing except burden the modern world with their existence.



After two years of working this job, my boss approached me and asked if I would be interested in a special type of promotion. I, of course, told him that I was very interested.



We scheduled a meeting to discuss what the promotion would entail. Things like job duties, benefits, and most importantly, pay.



He started by telling me what my assignments would be. I‚Äôd be transporting the bodies of deceased patients down to the cremator, simple. At certain hospitals this would have already been one of my expected assignments. However, at my work, only specialized personnel could move the deceased.¬†



The rest of the staff calls them the reapers. When a patient has passed away, they are quick to appear, take the body, and leave. That is pretty much the only time they are seen.¬†



He then told me basic stuff: cover them so you don‚Äôt traumatize a kid by showing them a dead person, take the body to an elevator down to the basement yada, yada, yada.

What was very interesting was the pay. It was s*ky fucking high*. I would do anything for that type of pay. And oh, I did.



I accepted my new position. Better pay, I don‚Äôt have to argue with wackos, plus I only appear when I have to. That sounds fucking great.



When I returned to work the next morning, there was a dead body that had to be taken care of.



I got called in, and after the family had said their goodbyes, I began pushing the movable bed towards the elevator. The dead body that was once Thomas Neil weighed around 90 kg and was about 185 cm tall.¬†



This was relevant information as I had come to learn that a lot of cremators are very automated today. You simply put in, name, weight, height, and gender, and the machine does the rest.



I scanned my brand new tag and pushed the once-forbidden C button.



The elevator slowly made its way down, and the doors slid open. The rumors that the other hospital staff had made up about the reapers' C floor could not have been further from the truth.



There were no bunkbeds that they all slept in, nor were there any coffins for anyone to sleep in. It looked like a normal break room, people sipping coffee and chatting.



An old lady greeted me. With a friendly tone, she said, ‚ÄúOkay, follow me, I‚Äôll show you the ropes‚Äù.



It was weird seeing how nonchalant she was about the entire thing. I was transporting someone who was once living and breathing, full of life and dreams, but the lady didn‚Äôt seem to mind. She was busy talking about how the free coffee was quite shit, and that I should bring my own, or swearing that she forgot about her grandkids birthday.



We eventually reached a big double door.¬† She opened it and gestured for me to go inside. The room we walked into was gigantic. The room didn‚Äôt make sense. The ceiling was too high not to be visible from above ground. The ground was uneven and hard to walk on.



The uneven terrain made the body's arms fly all over the place, like it was having a seizure. I‚Äôm a bit ashamed to say that I still laugh about that to this day.



In the middle of the room, there was a pit. Holy shit, did the pit smell. It reminded me of that one time I forgot a few steaks in my car in the middle of summer. I looked down into it and saw no bottom. However, there were rhythmic waves of air coming out of it hitting my face.



The old lady gave me strict orders on how I should align the bed next to the pit. I followed suit.



She then showed me a lever on the side of the inner bedframe. When I pulled the lever two bed legs shortened, and the body rolled off down into the pit.



I stared but didn‚Äôt question anything. I was being paid too well to ask questions about this.



I saw how the body disappeared out of sight down into the pit. As we turned to walk back out, I could hear the faint sound of something smacking its lips. It sounded greasy.



The old lady, whom I later learned was named Kathy, a woman whom I now adore. She swore like a sailor and drinks like one, too. She then showed me what was next on the agenda.



I was supposed to scoop up some wood ashes, put them into a temporary urn, and label it with the guy's name. The only question I asked was what if the family does not want to cremate the body? They had it covered. You just got a doll of the body made.¬†



Quite impressive, honestly, they got the same weight, height, and freckles. It was the same down to the last minute detail. I‚Äôm sure they didn‚Äôt need to make them that detailed. Better safe than sorry, I guess.



I don‚Äôt hate my job. Honestly, I quite enjoy it. Easy money, the co-workers are fine, and I barely work. I still have to listen to those greasy lips smacking whenever I deliver a body, but a pair of earplugs quickly stopped that problem. The only annoying part of the job is waiting for the weepy family members to leave the body. Oh, and giving them those dust jars. Jesus Christ, you would think I handed them their death sentence.



I guess this is a type of confession. I don‚Äôt feel bad for what I do. The only time I do is when I have to move the young ones. I always make sure I have my earplugs in when I drop them off. But hey, the family still gets closure, and I get paid.¬†



*No harm done, right?*

1kcbiu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1kcbiu7/the_benefits_of_keeping_a_cannabis_journal/,The Benefits of Keeping a Cannabis Journal,"You can keep a cannabis journal for several reasons. Not only does journaling your experiences make you more mindful, but it also helps identify and achieve your goals regarding consuming cannabis. This is especially helpful for medical cannabis patients.

Overall, every human body is different. That means everyone will react differently to the same or similar products. You may even respond differently to the same product if taken on a different day.

Journaling your experiences makes it easier for yourself and your patient consultant to identify which products can reproduce the perfect experience. Keep reading to learn more about cannabis journaling and how it can help you achieve all your cannabis goals.

# How To Cannabis Journal

Cannabis journaling isn‚Äôt very difficult. The most challenging part is ensuring that you record your experience each time you use cannabis. By being consistent, you‚Äôll find it easier to determine patterns that can help you maintain successful sessions.

Follow the steps below to learn how to cannabis journal:

# What Type of Journal Are You Using?

Do you prefer writing longhand or simply using a memo app on your cellphone? Pick a version that will allow you to keep up with it daily.

If you prefer to write out your experiences by hand, you can purchase physical strain journals like¬†[Goldleaf‚Äôs Patient Journal](https://www.leafly.com/brands/goldleaf/products/goldleaf-the-patient-journal-medical-cannabis-companion). Please keep them in your house where you won‚Äôt forget about them.

Journaling the old-fashioned way, while not the most convenient method for some, has its benefits, as studies show that it keeps your mind sharp and helps you retain information. However, keep in mind that journaling is supposed to be stress-free. So, do what feels right for you.

# Before Dosing

Now that you know what type of journal you want, you can get down to business. First, you‚Äôll want to assess your baseline. Include the basics, like:

* Date
* Time
* Cannabis product name and where you purchased it
* Delivery method
* Symptoms (pain, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, etc.)
* What other medications you‚Äôre on
* If and what you‚Äôve eaten/drank before your session
* Overall mood (powerful emotions can influence your experience)

# After Dosing

Depending on your delivery method (smoking, edibles, etc.), you may feel the effects immediately, or it may take a while (sometimes up to two hours). Allow your body to fully experience the cannabis before recording your findings.

You should note:

* Dosage consumed and be specific (‚Äúone half-gram pre-roll‚Äù is better than ‚Äúsmoking a joint‚Äù)
* How you feel
* How long the effects lasted
* Symptom relief (if any)
* Side effects
* Current state of mind (did the session change anything?)

It‚Äôs paramount that you are specific about the outcomes and symptom relief that you feel.

# Why Should You Keep a Cannabis Journal?

You should keep a cannabis journal for many reasons, especially if you‚Äôre a medical cannabis patient. Some of the reasons you should keep a cannabis journal include:

# It Helps Your Caregiver or Patient Consultant

It‚Äôs impossible to ask yourself to keep up with the latest trends in cannabis research, products, and genetics. To do that all is a full-time job! Instead, as a medical cannabis user, you should rely on your caregiver or patient consultant.

Providing a detailed log of what products and delivery methods have worked and haven‚Äôt worked is the best way to ensure your caregiver or patient consultant has all the necessary information to succeed you succeed in your treatment plan.

# It Helps Repeat Successes

If you want to repeat the successful sessions, you must have the ability to remember which cultivars, dosages, and delivery methods work best for you. It can be difficult to remember everything from one session to the next. (*A cultivar is a plant that has been selectively bred to have distinct, desirable characteristics*)

By having a physical journal, you don‚Äôt risk losing any of your valuable information to technology that‚Äôs gone haywire.

# Writing Is Good for The Mind

Writing does terrific things for your memory and comprehension. By writing out everything you experience while taking cannabis, you‚Äôll be more likely to thoroughly understand your own body‚Äôs response to cannabis, which will help you make more informed decisions.

# Journaling Promotes Mindfulness

Writing, especially with a pen and some paper, helps the mind slow down and induces a certain level of focus. It‚Äôs almost like meditation. This focus is called mindfulness.

Mindfulness helps you to leave worrying emotions, like anxiety, at the door so you can better focus on the task at hand. You‚Äôll be more attentive to your symptoms and treatment by being mindful.

# You Get A Complete Picture

A journal is open-ended, meaning that you can add other essential factors along with writing down the obvious entry points like cultivar, dosage, and delivery method. These could include:

* Sleep quality
* Water intake
* Food intake
* Other medications/supplements you may be on
* Coffee intake
* Alcohol intake

Keeping detailed notes on the seemingly ordinary parts of your life can expose why you react to specific cultivars, dosages, and delivery methods the way you do. Even a stressful day at work can affect how you respond to cannabis. So, no matter how trivial something may seem, don‚Äôt think twice before writing it down.

# You‚Äôre Creating A Database

If you‚Äôre a cannabis user, you must know how difficult it can be to compare one cannabis product to another. The lack of unified regulation on plant genetics, concentrations, grow practices, and more means that even the same strain can vary significantly in effects from dispensary to dispensary.

To try and replicate successful therapies, make notes of ‚Äúwhere the product was acquired‚Äù or ‚Äúhow it was grown.‚Äù

# Final Thoughts

For those looking to get the most out of our cannabis, keeping a cannabis journal is one of the best measures we can take to ensure we do just that. Your cannabis journal will help you discover and remember your preferences by having you log your experiences and usage.

A cannabis journal can help you discover patterns that can improve your symptoms, avoid products you dislike and find the most effective time of day to consume your cannabis.

Overall, cannabis journals can do wonders for your cannabis experiences and mental health. If you haven‚Äôt started one already, we highly recommend that you do!",2,1746113262.0,MedicalCannabis_NI,0,1.0,False

I know it's not my taste buds because I also ordered a small birthday cake latte at the same time to try out that flavor, and that was plenty sweet and tasty. Went back a week later and ordered a large birthday cake latte thinking maybe something was off with the golden eagle or my taste changed... But same result. Very bitter unflavored coffee, even though the small of the same drink was really good (frankly almost too sweet). Tried ordering extra sweet for my large the next time, no change. Not sure if the broista just forgot to add the extra syrup, but extra sweet tasted exactly the same as the regular recipe, bitter.

1kcbeyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1kcbeyr/how_do_you_protect_a_child_from_generational/,How do you protect a child from generational enmeshment and denial? (Looking for advice.),"I‚Äôm in the middle of a highly contentious divorce. My SBTX is extremely enmeshed with her mother ‚Äî to a point that‚Äôs honestly dangerous ‚Äî but she refuses to see it.

My STBX is pretty isolated. She‚Äôs estranged from most of her mom‚Äôs family, from her dad‚Äôs side too, and now from me. She even tried (and failed) to get 100% custody of our daughter. Thankfully, we now share 50/50.

A lot of the estrangement traces back to stories her mother told her ‚Äî like how her dad‚Äôs parents ‚Äúabused and neglected‚Äù her ‚Äî but her dad‚Äôs siblings disagree, and there‚Äôs a huge family split over it. Why she‚Äôs not close to her mother‚Äôs side of the family beats me, but I assume it‚Äôs similar allegations.

When my ex was 12, her mom would confide in her about fears that her husband (my ex‚Äôs dad) might kill himself. A 12-year-old should never be put in that position. That was a huge red flag, but my ex has normalized it ‚Äî often blaming her father for putting her mother ‚Äúthrough a very difficult time.‚Äù

I know I can‚Äôt change my ex‚Äôs mind. If she ever allowed herself to really see what happened, she‚Äôd have to admit that:
‚Ä¢ She stood by while her dad was emotionally abused.
‚Ä¢ She chose a similar dynamic in her marriage (with me).
‚Ä¢ She could potentially be enabling the same kind of harm toward our daughter.

That‚Äôs too much for her to face ‚Äî so she won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm very aware of that.

On top of that, her mother (my ex-mother-in-law) is a teacher who hides behind her title as proof of her ‚Äúmoral character.‚Äù Students have reported her for abusive behavior, but it‚Äôs always brushed off as ‚Äúteenagers being dramatic‚Äù or ‚Äúfalse accusations.‚Äù She‚Äôs even been called a narcissist by her students ‚Äî which honestly tracks ‚Äî but she dismisses the term as ‚Äúoverused.‚Äù

She also fancies herself an expert on mental health and will casually diagnose and prescribe things to others. For example, her husband is on some pretty hardcore antidepressants, and she references them whenever he doesn‚Äôt do what she wants. I honestly don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôs depressed ‚Äî I believe he‚Äôs severely emotionally abused.

This same tactic was attempted on me during the divorce. My ex accused me of having a mental health disorder that made her and our daughter unsafe. The ‚Äúevidence‚Äù?
‚Ä¢ I walked a lot,
‚Ä¢ I drank coffee inconsistently,
‚Ä¢ I listened to the same song more than once,
‚Ä¢ And I wore a size 10.5 shoe.

Luckily, these accusations were seen for what they were ‚Äî complete nonsense ‚Äî and she failed miserably in her attempt to take custody.

Her mother is dangerous, and I know I have to do everything I can during my 50% custody time to protect my daughter from this toxic dynamic.

While I would love to have a productive co-parenting relationship, I can‚Äôt. We‚Äôre parallel parenting ‚Äî to the extreme.
For my safety, parallel parenting is the right choice. But my ex justifies it under the pretense of ‚Äúprotection.‚Äù

In reality, she‚Äôs only protecting herself ‚Äî from ever having to acknowledge what‚Äôs transpired.

For example: if I ask why we‚Äôre doing something a certain way, she refuses to answer and immediately threatens legal action to shut down the conversation.

So far, she has spent over $100,000 on legal fees ‚Äî all to avoid having a single honest discussion with me.

My questions:
‚Ä¢ Are there any realistic opportunities to address this openly in the future (without damaging my relationship with my daughter)?
‚Ä¢ Has anyone else navigated something like this?
‚Ä¢ How do you talk to a young child about these dynamics when they‚Äôre too young to understand, but you know you need to plant healthy seeds early?

Any advice or personal stories would mean a lot. Thank you.",1,1746112997.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

Among the most promising innovations in this space are **compostable pouches**‚Äîa breakthrough in eco-friendly packaging that aligns with global efforts to reduce plastic pollution and transition to a circular economy. These pouches are designed to decompose naturally in composting environments, leaving behind no toxic residue. As industries ranging from food to cosmetics move toward greener alternatives, compostable pouches are gaining traction as a smart, responsible, and future-focused packaging solution.

Unlike traditional plastic packaging that can linger in landfills for hundreds of years, [**compostable pouches**](https://bowepack.com/pages/compostable-packaging) are crafted from renewable, plant-based materials such as PLA (polylactic acid), kraft paper, and cellulose. These materials are designed to break down under composting conditions‚Äîtypically within 90 to 180 days‚Äîturning into nutrient-rich soil. Certified compostable pouches often meet standards such as ASTM D6400 (USA) or EN 13432 (EU), which ensure they decompose safely without harming the environment. As consumers become more aware of the consequences of single-use plastics, the appeal of packaging that literally returns to the earth is growing rapidly.

Functionality is a major advantage of modern compostable pouches. Far from being fragile or limited in use, today‚Äôs compostable packaging is engineered to offer **durability, barrier protection, and user convenience**. High-performance barrier films protect contents from oxygen, moisture, and light, making these pouches suitable for food items, dry goods, supplements, and more. They can also feature resealable closures, tear notches, and custom printing to enhance both usability and branding. Whether used for organic snacks, coffee, or skincare products, compostable pouches deliver a seamless balance of eco-consciousness and product performance.

For businesses, the shift to compostable pouches represents an opportunity to lead in sustainability while building **brand loyalty and trust**. Consumers are increasingly aligning their purchasing decisions with their environmental values, and packaging plays a crucial role in shaping those perceptions. By using compostable pouches, brands can clearly communicate their commitment to reducing waste and protecting the planet. Moreover, this move can support broader corporate sustainability goals and compliance with emerging regulations around plastic usage. As governments around the world push bans on single-use plastics and promote composting infrastructure, early adoption of compostable packaging positions companies as forward-thinking and responsible.

Looking ahead, **the future of compostable pouches** is set to grow stronger with ongoing innovation and consumer demand. Research and development in bio-based materials are leading to even more effective compostable films that offer longer shelf life, improved printability, and faster decomposition. As municipal composting programs expand and awareness of industrial versus home compostability increases, it will become easier for consumers to dispose of these pouches responsibly. Additionally, collaborative efforts between packaging producers, waste management systems, and policy makers are helping to create a more supportive ecosystem for compostable solutions. In this evolving landscape, compostable pouches are not just a trend‚Äîthey are a transformative step toward a zero-waste future.",1,1746112893.0,Post_Anything_,0,1.0,False

I'm a big fan of minimal texting up front and just meeting in person, because there is no point in building up hope when there may be no chemistry in person. At any rate, as is par for the course with online dating, he was a bit of a flake but kept insisting he wanted to meet and finally we had something planned. Coffee on a Saturday afternoon. We confirmed that morning - I suggested 3p, he then asked to push it to 4p, then 4:15p, then 4:30p. I said fine but that I had plans at 6p. We're in a major urban city and it's easy to get from point A to point B and he was gonna come to my neighborhood.

At 4:15p he texts me saying he needs to cancel as he doesn't think this aligns with his goals. I was taken back because he had been so eager to meet in all our communications. I said I was disappointed but I wasn't going to beg him. Then within the next hour he tells me he changed his mind and said he wanted to meet after all. I told him no and blocked his ass!

That would've been end of story  . . . but then about a week later he messages me from a different number begging for a second chance. Won't lie I was kind of flattered so I agreed to go out again. But after a few texts back and forth . . . it wasn't going anywhere so I blocked his ass again!

Then flash forward to now . . . 2 months later. He messages me from a DIFFERENT number and says he still wants to meet up . . . on one hand, I'm all NO. He wasted my time once, he's not gonna waste it again. But then there's a part of me that's had shit luck in dating and I'm kind of . . . flattered? I've seen deleted the app and am not actively dating because of burn out.

TL;DR: I (44F) had a date with a 32M who canceled on me 15 min before a date. A week later, he asked for a second chance but nothing happened, and 2 months later he has reached out again. Do I give him another chance?",0,1746112836.0,datingoverforty,51,0.45,False

1kcba5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1kcba5j/explore_the_travelpro_maxlite_5_carryon_luggage/,Explore the Travelpro Maxlite 5 Carry-On Luggage review for lightweight durability!,"Testing out the Travelpro 401176706 Maxlite and experiencing its features firsthand was genuinely a rewarding adventure. I‚Äôve relied on this carry-on for multiple trips now, and it‚Äôs readily proven to be a reliable travel buddy through hectic airports, cramped overhead bins, and even a bumpy cab ride or two. Here‚Äôs an in-depth breakdown of what sets this piece of luggage apart, along with some aspects that might need a second thought.

**Lightweight Design That Doesn't Compromise Durability**  
What immediately stands out about this carry-on is how light it feels. At only 5.28 pounds, it‚Äôs one of the lightest I‚Äôve encountered, almost making me second-guess if I‚Äôd mistakenly packed light for once! Dark urban mornings and sleepy walks to my train station with this piece felt effortless. Despite its feather-light nature, the bag boasts durable polyester fabric treated with a stain-resistant, water-repellent Duraguard coating. This feature offered me peace of mind as my luggage survived accidental puddles and an unexpected coffee spill without a hitch.  

**User-Friendly Maneuverability**  
The smooth-rolling 360¬∞ spinner wheels deliver what they promise. I‚Äôve glided this suitcase across tiled airport floors, uneven sidewalks, and the glossy, reflective surfaces of shopping malls without feeling dragged down. Additionally, the PowerScope Lite handle with rubberized touchpoints was much appreciated, especially during late-night flights when I couldn‚Äôt muster more energy to lug anything heavy.  

[Grab Travelpro 401176706 Maxlite deals on Amazon now.](https://bagsby.com/check/b07bwjvxnl/)  

**Packing Capacity and Organizing Options**  
Being expandable by up to two inches is a lifesaver. I tend to overpack, yet this bag accommodated two weeks‚Äô worth of clothes thanks to the 39-liter capacity. Adjustable hold-down straps kept everything from turning into a wrinkled heap. Plus, the variety of compartments, including a full-length interior lid pocket and exterior accessory pockets, left me with ample options for sorting out my tech gadgets, toiletries, and chargers separately. However, I'd note that the bag's narrow footprint limits its interior dimensions slightly, making it more suitable for packing compact or rolled clothes rather than bulkier garments.

**Comfort Features**  
I enjoyed the contoured grip of the handle, especially when zigzagging through crowded terminals. Low-profile handles on the sides also came in handy to lift the bag onto baggage belts. These seemingly small touches elevate the product‚Äôs user experience, especially when seconds matter during international transfers.  

**Winning Points**  
- Ultra-lightweight design eliminates unnecessary strain.  
- Spinner wheels ensure smooth and multi-directional movement.  
- Multiple compartments keep my belongings incredibly organized.  
- Water-repellent coating protects against accidental spills.  

**Caveats**  
- Packing around the interior bars, although manageable, required additional creativity since the fabric lining inside doesn‚Äôt stretch fully to maximize the three sides around those bars.  
- No built-in lock system is included, necessitating external locks if exploring security-heavy destinations.  
- The tapered expansion might not work well if fully packed as it risks tipping sideways occasionally while upright.

**Competing Options on the Market**  
When comparing the Maxlite to the wildly popular Away and Samsonite, I found distinct differences. Samsonite products often lean towards slightly bulkier designs, which might not fit well in tighter overhead bins. Away bags, albeit aesthetically pleasing, carry a heftier base weight, making the Travelpro a better choice for travelers like me who value ultra-portability. On another note, brands like Monos and Tumi prioritize luxury finishes but at premium pricing, which keeps Travelpro in a sweet spot for offering robust performance without inflated costs.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
While I initially questioned spending on luggage, the features packed into this product make it a worthy contender in its category. Competitors with similar qualities often reside at a higher price tier, while this one balances cost-efficiency with high-quality construction. Its functionalities undeniably amplify the travel experience, justifying its value against others in its class.

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends from Europe or even Lithuania who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature, but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I‚Äôm really into the series *Cunk on Earth*.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is *T≈´la*.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamani≈≥ ≈†ilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I‚Äôm always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks, whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

Oh, and I‚Äôm a huge coffee fan, it‚Äôs basically my hobby!

Every grind setting it either sprays or cloggs the machine.

Hey r/WesternMassachusetts!

Good news for book lovers and small-town supporters ‚Äî **The Book Nook in Belchertown** has announced plans to expand its cozy storefront into a full-fledged **community hub and caf√©**, set to open this spring.

For years, The Book Nook has been a staple of the Belchertown downtown scene ‚Äî known for its curated selection of new and used books, friendly staff, and regular events like poetry readings and kids‚Äô story hours. Now, owner **Linda Ruiz**, who took over the shop five years ago, says the expansion will bring:

- A small coffee and pastry bar  
- More event space for author talks and workshops  
- A dedicated kids' reading nook  
- Rotating displays from local artists  
- A ‚Äúblind date with a book‚Äù section to encourage readers to try something new

> ‚ÄúWe want this place to be more than just a bookstore,‚Äù Ruiz said in a recent interview with *The Reminder*. ‚ÄúWe want it to be a welcoming space where people can connect, create, and relax.‚Äù

The new layout will nearly double the store‚Äôs current footprint, using a recently vacated adjacent storefront. Construction is expected to begin later this month.

### Why This Matters

Small businesses have faced huge challenges over the past few years, especially during the pandemic. Seeing a local shop not only survive but thrive ‚Äî and invest back into the community ‚Äî is something worth celebrating.

If you‚Äôve never checked out The Book Nook, now might be the perfect time to plan a visit. And if you have a favorite memory from the shop, share it below ‚Äî we‚Äôd love to hear what makes this place special to you.

Let me start by saying that I am not an afficionado and have no interest in buying a grinder. I'm fine with lavazza when I can't get to my local coffee shop and have them grind their beans for me (currently construction and I'm not walking 10+ minutes in the cold for coffee, I know, I'm a bad person). 

I had a friend who was a barista for years teach me how to set everything up and she gave me the thumbs up regarding my espresso shots (pulls? I don't know, I'm terrible at knowing the correct terminology). 

Nothing has changed. I have descaled it previously and descaled it again recently even though it wasn't time just incase. I'm still on the same lavazza can that I was when it was working correctly two weeks ago, so it's not a grind issue. I don't have a new source of water. I have not changed my tamping type, or the amount of coffee I'm putting in. 

Despite that, I'm getting inconsistent pulls. My first shot dropped like 3 drops of coffee. I wasted it and tried again. Nothing was different. This time it completely overfilled the glass. Again, nothing is different. Same day, same coffee, same tamping pressure (ish, it's done by hand so I'm sure it's not perfect).  The first 4 times it did this I assumed I was just doing something wrong but now I'm not so sure. I've read this particular machine has issues after a few months.

A little bit of background information on Kendu: We are currently on 3 chains(Ethereum, Solana and Base) with ETH being our native chain, we have around 18k holders and sit at 12 million market cap, we have an very hardworking community, we are top 5 memecoins in terms of social media effort with Certik rating our community 98/100 and a IRL presence that is unprecedented, I am not gonna PvP other coins but I haven't found a coin with a Certik community score even close to Kendu's(you can check it out for yourself at the bottom of this page). Btw some background information on the Certik Score, Kendu and 1 other coin has reached 50k Certik votes to gain the free audit, this coin was Pepe.

**Why Do People Go On About Community and Why Does It Matter**

It has been proven time and time again that community is what defines the value of a memecoin. All Shib, Doge, Pepe had was a community. Community is all that matters and thats why I am so bullish on Kendu, if you have been watching the memecoin space you would have saw that Kendu is everywhere and is constantly raiding, making posts and just showing our strength in general. To me it is pretty clear to see that Kendu is going to the top, no one is currently on our level in terms of community strength across both social media and IRL.

This is entirely my opinion, but I do not see a single possibility where Kendu is under 10 billion market cap at the end of this cycle, Shib managed 44 billion when there was less money invested in crypto and with far less understanding of the potential of a memecoin. Pepe managed 10 billion outside of a bull run.......  
If they can manage the tens of billions, then so can Kendu, we have a community who is just as strong as theirs in the biggest bull run ever!!!!

Retail will love IRL initiatives since it gives a memecoin some substance and reliability, so Kendu is in an incredible position to benefit greatly when retail arrives, you want to hold Kendu before this, as we will move very fast!

My advice to you would be to at least get in our telegram, you don't have to buy anything it is completely free, you can compare our activity to other communities or ask questions. I guarantee that you will be impressed.

All the signs are there

‚ÄúYou know, here‚Äôs the thing about this: there are a lot of ways to do it, and there is no single right way.

You‚Äôre seeing a trend of this happening, not just with us in the workplace. I recognize this is a change, and we tried to give a little runway for it to happen. As I mentioned in the results, things are very uncertain right now.

I am a believer in the full executive office. Across the board we agreed that we‚Äôre better together. We talk about this rich culture we have and the innovation that happens, and I hear the reactions and the points you raise. I come to work and still dial into Teams meetings and call people, yes I do the same thing.

But I also go out to get coffee or, when something comes up in a meeting, run down to Kyle‚Äôs office and ask, ‚ÄúHey, how do we handle this?‚Äù Or I pop into Nicky‚Äôs office. Probably more often than she wants me there.

That‚Äôs where a lot of innovation and camaraderie happen. The team and I think we need to be together. That doesn‚Äôt mean we lack flexibility. I have four kids, ages 16 down to 10. My 10-year-old, unlike the teenagers, still wants to be around me and thinks I‚Äôm somewhat cool, so I drop him at the bus stop on the way to work when I can.

Yesterday we had earnings, so I couldn‚Äôt, but when I can, I do. If I need to be at a game, pick him up, or go to a doctor‚Äôs appointment, I leave, handle it, and log on from home.

When the repair person gives you that wonderful ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there between noon and four‚Äù and shows up at six. I get it. you work from home that afternoon. We just can‚Äôt have that as a regular thing. Our customers work every day; our production employees work every day. The world‚Äôs uncertain and the pace is quick, so being together is the best environment to build the culture we need.

That still doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have flexibility. I do it; you should do it. This is simply what we feel is best for us right now. I recognize not everyone may agree, but that‚Äôs where we think we need to be. I‚Äôve been pushing five cultural pillars‚Äîcustomer-back thinking, thinking differently, and open, direct communication among them.

So I want to be honest with everyone about how we‚Äôre thinking. It‚Äôs important that you all know where we‚Äôre at.‚Äù


And then later:

‚ÄúWhile I love being here and I love the amenities, sometimes I feel the need to get out of the city and out of town. So I have a property, we built a place out there; we have UTVs for the kids and deer feeders, so we can get out, relax, and get away from things.

Those are the types of activities I‚Äôm passionate about. One thing I‚Äôm very conscious of as I step into this role is that it‚Äôs a 24/7, seven days a week job, and I‚Äôm committed to it. I knew what I signed up for. But I also protect my time: I‚Äôm going to take care of my family, and I‚Äôm not going to miss out on the kids and this part of their lives. That‚Äôs why I preach flexibility.

You need to know I‚Äôm going to do that because I have to in order to be effective at work, and you should do the same.‚Äù

Let's talk about wrangling the whole crew and heading southbound. You're dreaming of turquoise waters, sandy toes, and margaritas (virgin for the kiddos, naturally!), but the sheer logistics of a family trip to Mexico, let alone an all-inclusive one, can feel like taming a wild bronco. Fear not, weary parent! We're about to dive headfirst into the glorious mess that is planning an epic, hassle-free, *all-inclusive* getaway where the biggest decision you make all day is whether to hit the swim-up bar or the beach.

The ""Why All-Inclusive?"" Deep Dive: Is It Just About the Tacos (Spoiler: Mostly!)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, let‚Äôs be real for a second. When someone whispers ‚Äúall-inclusive,‚Äù what‚Äôs the first thing that pops into your head? Unlimited buffets? Free-flowing drinks? Lounging by a pool without having to pull out your wallet every five minutes? Yeah, me too! But for a family trip to Mexico, going all-inclusive isn't just about stuffing your face (though, let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs a glorious perk). It‚Äôs about shedding the stress of constantly calculating costs, wrangling hungry kids in search of snacks, and wondering if that extra Scoop of guacamole is going to blow your budget. It‚Äôs about the *freedom*. The glorious, blissful freedom to just *be*.

### Beyond the Buffet: The Hidden Perks of All-Inclusive for Families

Think about it. You‚Äôve got little humans with unpredictable appetites and energy levels that fluctuate like the stock market. Having food and drinks readily available, anytime, anywhere within the resort, is a game-changer. It‚Äôs not just about saving coin; it‚Äôs about saving your sanity. No more meltdowns because someone‚Äôs hangry while you‚Äôre frantically searching for a budget friendly taqueria. Plus, many resorts offer kids‚Äô clubs, dedicated pool areas with waterslides, and even built-in entertainment. It‚Äôs like a mini-village of fun, designed to keep everyone happy, including you. And let's not forget the sheer convenience of having everything in one place. Packing light becomes a real possibility (well, maybe!), and navigating foreign currency becomes a non-issue when everything‚Äôs paid for upfront.

Picking Your Paradise: Mexico‚Äôs All-Inclusive Hotspots for Families
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mexico is a big, beautiful country, and its coastline stretches for miles, offering a smorgasbord of options for your family‚Äôs all-inclusive adventure. From the lively energy of Cancun to the laid-back vibes of the Riviera Maya, and the Pacific charm of Puerto Vallarta, each destination has its own unique flavor. But which one is the perfect fit for your crew? Are you beach bums who want to spend all day with your toes in the sand? Or are you more adventurous types who want to explore ancient ruins and hidden cenotes? Let‚Äôs break it down.

### The Riviera Maya: Where Jungles Meet Jade Waters

Okay, if you‚Äôre picturing postcard-perfect beaches with powdery white sand and water so clear you can see your toes wiggling, then the Riviera Maya is calling your name. Stretching from Cancun down to Tulum, this coastline is packed with all-inclusive resorts geared towards families. Think sprawling properties with multiple pools, endless activities, and direct access to the Caribbean Sea. Plus, you‚Äôre smack-dab in the middle of some seriously cool stuff.

- **Cancun's Hotel Zone:** If you want convenience and access to a ton of restaurants, shops, and nightlife (though you might not get much of the latter with little ones!), this is a good bet. The beaches are stunning, and there are plenty of family-friendly resorts here. Just be prepared for a more bustling atmosphere.
- **Playa del Carmen:** A charming town with a pedestrianized Fifth Avenue (Quinta Avenida) perfect for strolling and souvenir shopping (read: bribing the kids with sugary treats). You can find a mix of larger resorts and smaller, boutique-style all-inclusives here. It offers a good balance of resort amenities and local flavor.
- **Tulum:** Looking for something a little more bohemian chic? Tulum‚Äôs your spot. It‚Äôs known for its stunning cliffside Mayan ruins and cenotes. While it‚Äôs not as packed with massive all-inclusives as other areas, there are some fantastic options here that offer a more relaxed, eco-friendly vibe. Be prepared for potentially higher prices, though.

### The Pacific Coast: Sunsets and Serenity (with a Side of Whales!)

Switching gears to the Pacific side, we‚Äôve got the likes of Puerto Vallarta and Riviera Nayarit. These destinations offer a different kind of beauty ‚Äì dramatic cliffs, lush jungle, and those famous Pacific sunsets that paint the sky in hues of orange and purple. Plus, depending on the time of year, you might even spot humpback whales!

- **Puerto Vallarta:** A vibrant city with a charming Old Town, a lively Malecon (boardwalk), and beautiful beaches. It‚Äôs got a great mix of resorts, from mega all-inclusives to smaller, more intimate properties. There‚Äôs also a thriving culinary scene if you decide to venture outside the resort (and trust me, it‚Äôs worth it!).
- **Riviera Nayarit:** Just north of Puerto Vallarta, this stretch of coastline is a little less developed and offers a more tranquil experience. Sayulita, San Pancho, and Punta de Mita are popular spots. You'll find some truly luxurious all-inclusive resorts here, perfect if you're looking for a bit of pampering alongside the family fun.

Decoding the All-Inclusive Jargon: Not All ""Unlimited"" Is Created Equal
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, deep breath. Now that you‚Äôve got a handle on *where* to go, let‚Äôs talk about *what* you‚Äôre actually getting with an all-inclusive package. It‚Äôs not as simple as ""food and drinks included."" Oh no, my friends, there are layers to this onion! Decoding the resort lingo is crucial to avoiding any unpleasant surprises (like finding out that the fancy a la carte restaurant isn't actually included, or that premium cocktails are a la carte).

### The Nitty-Gritty: What to Look for in Your All-Inclusive Package

This is where the detective work comes in. Don‚Äôt just book the first pretty picture you see online! Dive into the details of what's included in the price.

1. **Food and Drinks:** This is the big one, obviously. Are all the restaurants on the property included? Are there restrictions on which ones you can eat at? Is there a limit to how many a la carte meals you can have? What kind of alcoholic beverages are included (local brands vs. international premiums)? Are there snack bars or cafes with unlimited snacks throughout the day? This is paramount, especially with peckish youngsters!
2. **Activities and Entertainment:** Does the resort offer non-motorized water sports like kayaking and paddleboarding? Are there organized activities for kids and adults throughout the day? Is there live music or evening shows? Many resorts have dedicated kids‚Äô clubs with supervised activities ‚Äì a true blessing for parents wanting a little downtime.
3. **Resort Amenities:** Is wifi included? Is it reliable? Are beach chairs and towels provided? Is there a fitness center? Is access to the spa included (usually treatments are extra, but sometimes you get access to the hydrotherapy circuit)?
4. **Tips and Gratuities:** This is a big one that often catches people off guard. Some all-inclusive resorts include tips, while others recommend or expect additional tipping. Clarify this beforehand so you‚Äôre not left scrambling for cash at the end of your stay.
5. **Taxes and Fees:** Double-check that all applicable taxes and resort fees are included in the price you see. Nothing worse than getting hit with unexpected charges at checkout.

It's like comparing apples and oranges sometimes, so really dig into the fine print of what each resort is offering. Don't be afraid to call the resort directly if you have questions. Better safe than sorry, right?

Making Your All-Inclusive Family Trip to Mexico a Breeze: Pre-Trip Prep
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright, you‚Äôve picked your paradise, book the family trip to Mexico, and you‚Äôve done your homework on what‚Äôs included. Now comes the fun part (sort of): the pre-trip prep! This is where you can save yourselves a world of headaches down the line. A little planning goes a long way, especially when traveling with kids.

### Packing Smarter, Not Harder: The All-Inclusive Edition

Because you've got your food and most activities covered, you *can* pack a little lighter. But there are still some essentials you absolutely shouldn't forget.

- **Sun Protection is Non-Negotiable:** Sunscreen (reef-safe if you plan on swimming in sensitive areas!), hats, sunglasses, rash guards. The Mexican sun is no joke, and sunburned kids are grumpy kids. Trust me on this.
- **Swimwear Galore:** You'll likely be spending most of your time in and out of the water, so pack multiple swimsuits per person.
- **Casual Clothing:** Think sundresses, shorts, t-shirts, and sandals. Most resorts have pretty relaxed dress codes, especially during the day.
- **One ""Nice"" Outfit:** Some of the a la carte restaurants might have a slightly dressier requirement for dinner, so pack one outfit that‚Äôs a step up from your beachwear.
- **Medications and First-Aid Kit:** Bring any prescription medications, plus a basic first-aid kit with Band-Aids, antiseptic wipes, pain relievers, and motion sickness remedies.
- **Reusable Water Bottles:** Most resorts have water stations, so bringing your own bottle is a great way to stay hydrated and be environmentally friendly.
- **Beach Bag and Swim Cover-Ups:** Easy access for toting your essentials from your room to the pool or beach.
- **Small Backpack for Excursions:** If you plan on leaving the resort for any adventures.

### Getting Your Documents in Order: Passports, Visas, and Beyond

This might seem like a no-brainer, but double-check everyone‚Äôs passports! Make sure they are valid for at least six months *after* your intended departure date from Mexico. U.S. and Canadian citizens typically don‚Äôt need a visa for short tourist stays, but always double-check the current entry requirements for your nationality. Make copies of your passports and keep them separate from the originals. It‚Äôs also a good idea to leave a copy with someone back home.

### Travel Insurance: Because Life Happens!

Seriously, people, travel insurance is not an optional extra when traveling as a family. Unexpected illnesses, injuries, lost luggage, cancelled flights ‚Äì any of these can derail your trip and cost a pretty penny. Get a comprehensive policy that covers medical emergencies, trip interruption/cancellation, and lost or delayed baggage. Peace of mind is worth every cent.

Arrival and All That Jazz: Making the Most of Your First Few Hours
------------------------------------------------------------------

You've made it! You‚Äôve navigated the airport, collected your luggage, and now you‚Äôre pulling up to your glorious all-inclusive resort. The adventure has truly begun! But don‚Äôs just dump your bags and head straight for the pool (though the temptation is real!). Taking a few strategic steps upon arrival can set the tone for a smooth and enjoyable trip.

### Taming the Check-In Beast and Getting Oriented

Check-in can sometimes be a little chaotic, especially at large resorts. Be patient, have your booking confirmation and passports ready. Once you get your keys, take a moment to get your bearings. Grab a resort map and orient yourselves. Find out where the main restaurants, pools, kids' club, and guest services are located.

### The Resort Orientation: Don't Skip This!

Many resorts offer a brief orientation upon arrival or have information sessions throughout the day. While it might seem like a drag after a long travel day, these are invaluable! They'll cover things like:

- Restaurant hours and reservation policies (some a la cartes require reservations, and they can book up fast!).
- Activity schedules and where to sign up.
- Kids' club hours and age restrictions.
- Where to find towels, exchange currency, etc.

Think of it as your crash course in navigating your temporary home. It'll save you from wandering around aimlessly later on, wondering where to find a decent cup of coffee or sign up for that tequila tasting.

The All-Inclusive Itinerary (Sort Of): Embracing the Flow
---------------------------------------------------------

Okay, so you‚Äôre at an all-inclusive. Does that mean you have to have every single minute planned out? Absolutely not! The beauty of an all-inclusive is the flexibility. You can be as busy or as relaxed as you like. But having a general idea of how you want to spend your days can help you make the most of your time.

### Balancing Relaxation and Activities: Finding Your Family's Rhythm

This is where you tailor the experience to your family's interests and energy levels.

- **Morning People?** Hit the beach or pool early before it gets crowded.
- **Afternoon Adventurers?** Take advantage of resort activities like kayaking, paddleboarding, or joining a guided tour.
- **Low-Key Crew?** Spend your days lounging by the pool, reading, and enjoying the endless snacks.

Don't feel pressured to do *everything* the resort offers. Pick and choose what sounds fun and don't overschedule yourselves. Remember, you're on vacation!

### Eating Your Way Through Paradise: Conquering the All-Inclusive Dining Scene

Ah, the food! This is often a highlight (or sometimes a challenge!) of the all-inclusive experience.

- **Buffets:** They‚Äôre a staple and a lifesaver for picky eaters. Embrace them! But try to vary your choices so you don't get buffet fatigue.
- **A La Carte Restaurants:** These usually offer a nicer dining experience and a break from the buffet. Book reservations early if needed!
- **Snack Bars and Cafes:** Perfect for grabbing a quick bite between meals or satisfying those afternoon cravings.
- **Kids' Menus:** Most resorts will have kid-friendly options available, even at the a la carte restaurants.

Don't be afraid to try new things, but also know what your kids will actually eat to avoid meltdowns. And remember to stay hydrated! Those tropical drinks are delicious, but water is your friend.

Beyond the Resort Walls: Embracing Mexican Culture (Carefully!)
---------------------------------------------------------------

While the all-inclusive resort offers a comfortable bubble, it‚Äôs a shame to visit Mexico and not experience *some* of the local culture. It adds so much richness to your trip!

### Planning Kid-Friendly Excursions: A Taste of the Real Mexico

Before you book any tours, do your research! Are they reputable? Are they suitable for your children‚Äôs ages and interests? Some great options for families might include:

- **Visiting a Cenote:** Swimming in these natural sinkholes is a unique and refreshing experience (just make sure to find one with easy access for kids).
- **Exploring Mayan Ruins:** A fascinating history lesson come to life. Just be prepared for heat and sun.
- **Taking a Cooking Class:** A fun and delicious way to learn about Mexican cuisine.
- **Visiting a Local Market:** A sensory overload of sights, sounds, and smells. A great way to see local life in action.
- **Taking a Boat Trip:** Explore the coastline, look for dolphins, or visit a nearby island.

Start with shorter excursions and see how your kids handle them. Don't pack too much into one day. Remember, you can always come back!

### Safety First: Staying Cautious When Venturing Out

While most tourist areas in Mexico are very safe, it‚Äôs always wise to be aware of your surroundings, especially when traveling with children.

- **Book Tours Through Reputable Companies:** Your resort can often recommend trusted tour operators.
- **Don't Flash Valuables:** Keep your expensive jewelry and electronics out of sight.
- **Be Mindful of Your Belongings:** Keep your purse and wallet secure, especially in crowded areas.
- **Know Basic Spanish Phrases:** ""Hola,"" ""Gracias,"" ""Por favor,"" and ""Cu√°nto cuesta?"" (How much does it cost?) go a long way.
- **Let Someone Know Where You're Going:** If you're going on an independent excursion, let the resort front desk know or text a friend or family member back home.

It's not about being paranoid, just about being smart and taking basic precautions.

Surviving and Thriving: Tips and Tricks for a Meltdown-Free (Mostly!) Family Trip to Mexico All Inclusive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs be real. Traveling with kids, even on a dream vacation, can have its moments. There will likely be tantrums, disagreements, and maybe even a scraped knee or two. But with a little foresight and a lot of patience, you can navigate the bumps in the road and truly enjoy your time together.

### Managing Expectations: It Won't Be Perfect, and That's Okay!

Go into this trip with realistic expectations. Your kids are still kids, and they‚Äôll have their good days and bad days. There will be moments of chaos amidst the calm. Embrace the imperfections and focus on the positive memories you're creating.

### Building in Downtime: Avoiding Overtired Meltdowns

Kids (and adults!) need downtime. Don't schedule every minute of every day. Allow for lazy mornings, naps, and quiet time back in the room. Pushing overtired kids often leads to meltdowns.

### Snacking Strategically: The Key to Kid-Friendly Happiness

This is where the all-inclusive excels! Take advantage of the readily available snacks. Keep little tummies happy, and you‚Äôll likely have happier travelers. Pack some of their favorite non perishable snacks from home for the plane and airport.

### Embracing the Resort Amenities: Letting the Kids Be Kids

Let them splash in the pool for hours, visit the kids' club, participate in the silly pool games. This is *their* vacation too, and letting them expend energy and have fun in a safe environment is key.

### Parent Time is Crucial: Don't Forget About Yourselves!

If the resort offers childcare or a kids' club, take advantage of it! Schedule a date night with your partner, enjoy a quiet dinner, or just sit by the pool with a book (and maybe a pi√±a colada!). You deserve a break too.

### Documenting the Memories: Capturing the Magic

Take tons of photos and videos! These are the memories you'll cherish for years to come. Don't spend the entire trip glued to your phone, but make an effort to capture those special moments.

The Post-Trip Glow and Beyond: Cherishing Your Family Trip to Mexico
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You‚Äôve done it! You‚Äôve survived (and hopefully thrived!) on your all-inclusive family trip to Mexico. You‚Äôre back home, maybe a little tanner, definitely a little more relaxed, and armed with a treasure trove of memories. Now comes the fun part: savoring the experience.

### Reliving the Highlights: Sharing Stories and Photos

Gather the family and look through your photos and videos. Talk about your favorite moments, the funniest things that happened, and what everyone enjoyed the most. This helps solidify the memories and keeps the vacation spirit alive.

### Planning Your Next Adventure (Maybe!): The All-Inclusive Addiction

Beware! All-inclusive resort stays can be addictive. The ease and convenience are hard to beat, especially when traveling with a family. You might find yourself already eyeing up your next Mexican paradise for a future trip!

### The Value of Family Time: The Real Takeaway

At the end of the day, the fancy food, the unlimited drinks, the beautiful beaches ‚Äì they're all wonderful. But the most valuable takeaway from any family trip to Mexico is the *time* you spent together. Unplugging from the daily grind, creating shared experiences, and simply enjoying each other's company ‚Äì that‚Äôs what truly matters.

Conclusion: Your Mexican All-Inclusive Dream Awaits!
----------------------------------------------------

So, there you have it. Planning a family trip to Mexico all-inclusive might seem like a monumental task, but with a little research, a dash of patience, and a whole lot of enthusiasm, it‚Äôs entirely achievable and incredibly rewarding. From picking your perfect paradise to decoding the all-inclusive jargon and navigating the resort with your little ones in tow, you're now armed with the knowledge to make this dream vacation a reality. Embrace the spontaneity, savor the flavors, soak up the sun, and make memories that will last a lifetime. Mexico and its welcoming all-inclusive resorts are waiting to welcome your family with open arms (and endless tacos!). Are you ready to dive in?",1,1746111663.0,flightscheap,0,1.0,False

1kcaso0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1kcaso0/im_overweight_but_i_dont_know_if_this_is_a_mental/,"I‚Äôm overweight. But i don‚Äôt know if this is a mental struggle, physical issue, spiritual deficiency, or all 3.","
My specs are 31m 5‚Äô10‚Äù 225lbs as of writing this post. 250 was my heaviest a few months ago but that was due to medication i am no longer taking. 220lb was my average before the meds so i‚Äôm practically back to where i was.

I‚Äôve always been overweight/chubby my entire life. I remember being like 180lbs in 5th grade or something silly like that. Some context for why, i was abused as a child until my dad got custody at around 2nd grade. I was always a picky eater. He wasnt really ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù in my development i guess? He just gave me what i wanted, either to shut me up or to keep me happy, still not 100% sure which, i should ask now that i‚Äôve thought about it loll. Generally i would eat junk food. Grilled cheese. PB&J. Chicken nuggets. Yah know kid stuff. So yeah it kinda makes sense how i became fat/chubby. 

I carry my weight primarily in my gut, but as i gained more it‚Äôs spreading a bit to the rest of my torso and face/neck. Seeing more stretch marks that werent there before (at least i havent really noticed them) on my gut and torso and tricep area.

Growing up and older i‚Äôve expanded my pallet past just chicken nuggets so that‚Äôs not really an issue anymore. Veggies dont taste great but i dont particularly have an aversion to them. But they arent something i‚Äôm ‚Äúauthentically drawn towards doing‚Äù. I have to force myself to eat them, because it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe right thing to do‚Äù, according to health experts. I try my best to live authentically, which implies a life which you spend no willpower, acting and behaving based on duty and purpose and intention rather than ‚Äúdoing what i‚Äôm supposed to do‚Äù. Eating veggies requires willpower for me. A shift in perspective would be helpful here for me probably so it doesnt take willpower anymore, something i would automatically. This is a part of the spiritual component.

Weight-loss is just a math problem from my understanding. Calories in calories out. Looking at calories in, i‚Äôve not like specifically counted them. But i generally eat about the same every day. I‚Äôm eating about 2000 a week day, and that‚Äôs rounding upwards on my quick math, but people typically eat more than they think they do, so it‚Äôs probably a close estimate. Saturdays typically a little more, sundays a little less. I dont drink alcohol. I only really drink ~0 calorie things. Water with liquid flavoring. Diet iced tea. I like coffee lite and sweet so i have zero sugar creamer which isnt that many calories comparatively but here is where it‚Äôs a little tough to keep track of how many calories i‚Äôm actually consuming here. I dont actively measure, just kinda pour loll. I can drink black coffee but i drink coffee more so as a treat/comfort/habit rather than cause i need the energy. I can sleep after a cup. I drink only one cup a day (~16oz, so 2 cups i guess in one container) so even still it doesnt seem that bad. I‚Äôve gone without caffeine during times in my life and i‚Äôve been fine. Calories out, my metabolic rate can be calculated so yall can see that. I dont exercise much, although my job is half active half sitting. Not a pure desk job but not a manual laborer. But i‚Äôve gone to the gym in the past. You burn what 100 calories on the high end of cardio. Maybe more lifting. So sure i‚Äôll call it 500 calories burnt on a workout. I dont go to the gym now. As stated in my previous paragraph, i dont like doing things that require willpower. I dont have a desire to go to the gym. Going to the gym ‚Äúwould not come from me‚Äù, which implies willpower, which implies unsustainable, which implies a not good enough solution. I dont really care about my body i guess? I know i‚Äôm going to die one day. So nothing really matters. I‚Äôm single so it‚Äôs not like i have a body to maintain for someone. I dont do active things so it‚Äôs not like i need to maintain muscle strength or stamina/endurance. 80% of weight control is done in the kitchen not the gym so that‚Äôs my focus at this point. Gym is closer to ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù i think. The last 20% takes 80% of the effort. In terms of metabolism and digestion. I eat a good bit of fiber, shit at least once a day at around the same time. I‚Äôm generally consistent. I feel like my metabolism isnt like strained enough. It‚Äôs almost ‚Äútoo efficient‚Äù if i‚Äôm making sense. I‚Äôve dealt with that idea of efficiency a lot in my mental space/thought process/ ‚Äúhow i move through life‚Äù. That part of me that is efficient may also extend to my metabolism too. I dunno i‚Äôm just shooting in the dark here, i‚Äôm probably wrong on this idea. I dont know shit about biology so my ideas on this entire paragraph could be completely wrong. Just trying to share my experiences and thought processes. A change in perspective is healthy and generally what i‚Äôm looking for so please challenge my understanding. That‚Äôs the physical + spiritual component.

I‚Äôve gotten over a nicotine addiction. I smoked cigarettes, then moved to a vape, then back to cigarettes, and now i‚Äôm done. Zero cravings. I‚Äôve heard people say ‚Äúyou never truly quit‚Äù well i‚Äôm confident i have. It took me a few tries but this time is different. I‚Äôve been able to do that because i‚Äôve deeply analyzed my behaviors and motivations behind smoking. Why i would do it. What drives the behavior, etc etc. I recommend a nicotine addiction to anyone with the idea that they eventually quit. I think it‚Äôs a very very valuable lesson/experience to become addicted to something physically bad for you then drop that addiction. I bring this up because i‚Äôm trying to apply the same process to my eating. The primary difference between the two is that you have to actually eat to live lmao. A big part of quitting cigarettes for me was learning ‚Äúwhat i was feeling internally before a craving, during a craving, while smoking, after smoking‚Äù. Trying to apply that same idea here, it just kinda falls apart? When i eat. I‚Äôm not even particularly hungry. I eat at my designated times. I dislike feeling discomfort, as everyone does, so i feel like i eat before i let myself feel hunger pains. It‚Äôs a system i‚Äôve built around myself that gets the job done essentially. If i could live without eating and i wouldnt feel hunger pains but i wouldnt be allowed to eat, after adjusting to not eating, i wouldnt miss it. But i have to eat, everyone does. It‚Äôs also a social thing rather than a purely energy standpoint. If no one had to eat  but eating was an activity one can still do, i probably wouldnt eat very often, probably only socially (just like smoking tbh. I‚Äôll smoke a dart socially, honestly i dont enjoy it like i used to but i still do it cause why not?). ‚ÄúEating to avoid discomfort rather than eating because i feel discomfort‚Äù is generally what‚Äôs going on. But is that hunger? Is hunger supposed to be that pain you feel or is it something subconscious that you dont even realize? My signals are pretty messed up here. I assume that you are supposed to eat when you *feel* hungry. Subconscious does not feel anything and therefore those ideas should be ignored, at least from my perspective. But why do i reach for food in the first place? I snack a good bit, but i still maintain 2k ish calories snacking and everything included. But i still snack when i dont feel hungry. It‚Äôs closer to ritualistic to be honest. I‚Äôll have a few oreos before bed because that‚Äôs what i do, not because i‚Äôm feeling hunger. Is this a craving of sugar? What‚Äôs a food craving feel like? Is it different than a smoking craving? Many questions and confusion, in part due to my own experiences with smoking cravings. Smoking cravings i would *feel* something. Eating oreos before bed i do not. It doesnt ‚Äúfeel like a craving‚Äù to me. So what‚Äôs going on? I never really have cravings for things. ‚ÄúNothing comes from me‚Äù in terms of food so i dont really have internal guidance here. Sure i *like* foods. I also dislike foods. But just like drinking black coffee or smoking a cigarette you dont want to smoke, you can do things outside of your ‚Äúauthentic self‚Äù and still be authentic about it essentially. As long as the decision comes from *you* then that‚Äôs all that matters. That‚Äôs the spiritual + mental component.

Avoiding discomfort is a pretty common theme in my life, past and present, which when saying it outloud like this is probably at least partially the root of all of this. I just dont really have an authentic reason for choosing to go hungry when i dont actually have to, and it‚Äôs going to get cured once i eat anyways. So why let it happen to begin with? I can deal with discomfort when it isnt in my control. But i dont actively choose it. I dont authentically get the ideas to do something uncomfortable. ‚ÄúDo it for the sake of it‚Äù doesnt exist for me when it comes to discomfort. I will always choose an option that is comfortable. ‚ÄúIdeas of discomfort‚Äù do not come from me. So then i should use willpower to make myself discomfort? But i am not my willpower and it is inauthentic so why would i do it lmao. It‚Äôs one thing to actually say things that have the ‚Äúappearance of discomfort‚Äù, example being mentioning my child abuse. Reasonably speaking talking about that is something that would ‚Äúmake someone uncomfortable‚Äù. But i dont actively *feel discomfort* while talking about it. There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúappearance of discomfort‚Äù and actually *being uncomfortable*. It‚Äôs nothing you choose, it just happens. No control. Which yeah i guess echos also the ideas of efficiency and what not. Efficiency is optimized control. I have to reflect on that a bit more too when i have the space. More spiritual component.

Why do i want to lose weight to begin with? Honestly. I‚Äôve always felt like i was a skinny person lmao. I never really identified as being ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù. Sure i‚Äôve thought i was fat as a kid while being a kid. Objectively i was/am over weight. I could see and understand i was physically larger and couldnt run as fast and what not. But i dont *feel* like that. It‚Äôs not who i am. So i guess this is body dysmorphia? I dunno. Losing the weight feels like a strive towards more authenticity to me, matching my external projection with my internal world. More spiritual component.

Anyways. I wrote this post to have my perspective challenged on some concepts and ideas. Maybe someone can help me approach these experiences and understandings through a different lens? Change my view. Prove me wrong. I‚Äôm still overweight so i‚Äôm missing a piece of the puzzle still. I do have a physical coming up in a few weeks and i‚Äôm going to talk about my weight there with my PCP. But that‚Äôs closer to the physical side of things, it doesnt really tackle the mental nor spiritual.

I hopped onto Instagram and realized no one had even really been messaging me like they used to for about a month. i figured since I was really just a coworker, and I hadn't been there, that they forgot about me, which is whatever. i looked at some coworkers accounts to message one of them and found that almost all my coworkers had either unfollowed or blocked me. i started to cry. I couldn't comprehend what was happening. especially because they had been texting me first the last few times we spoke, I sent some memes, and never got a response, or they replied to my stories. then crickets out of nowhere.

the co owner finally called me and said the owner was there. my stomach dropped. I knew it had to be something serious but was still confused. the co owner went on to say that multiple of my coworkers had come to him and reported me for sexual behavior too inappropriate for the work space and no longer felt safe working with me. i became hysterical. the only thing stopping me from screaming in shock was the fact I was trying to remain composed for the call and that I was in a campus building working on something when I took the call, luckily I was alone. he said that due to the severity of my actions I was ultimately terminated. i got dizzy. i almost threw up. i was crying so hard I couldn't see. i never would've expected this, especially given the nature my coworkers joke *towards* or *at* me. i thought of all the times I let it slide that they were being crude on shift and saying sexual comments and I either matched the energy or just went ""woah, hey"" and tried to leave it at that. to say I was *unsafe* to work with? it felt like I was in a nightmare.

he asked if I had any clue this is how I was making people feel. he gave me a few minutes to compose myself. i eventually said no, not at all whatsoever. he said the nature of the behavior was mostly in the way I joked with people. i immediately grew embarrassed. the fact my coworkers would initiate sexual jokes with me, egg it on, keep the joke going, for it to result in this? i immediately apologized to them and also said that I was so, so sorry to my coworkers if they would pass that on. the co owner said he could definitely tell I was in remorse and shocked by the situation (well, yes). i absolutely never denied me making someone uncomfortable, as I've always taken these kind of situations very seriously. at the same time, I could only ever think of times they made me uncomfortable first and I tried to joke it off or respond nonchalantly.

i went through my apologies first. i told them I'm utterly embarrassed and that I'm sorry they even had to have this conversation, and that I'm sorry I brought this energy into their work place, and that I ever made someone feel this way. he said it was extremely obvious it was just jokes that went too far, and that he had already spoken to other coworkers, managers, and leads about what is and isn't inappropriate on shift. the more I thought about that comment, the more disheartened I felt that I wasn't a part of those conversations before it got to this point. but ultimately, I had been gone for a month. prior to me being gone, I had stepped away from everyone. i realized these were jokes I didn't want to be making on shift. several coworkers would make jokes NSFW in nature. or the occasional comment of ""woah, that was romantic"" if we accidentally bumped hands/hips. two coworkers were making jokes about threesomes and being in a polycule with one of their boyfriends. they would show me pictures of sex toys they got for each other. one of them even sent me a nude on shift I almost opened in front of a customer and I snapped at him to not do that while another person and him laughed. i never reported him because we would joke and I thought it was all in good fun, he would initiate and egg it on; additionally, he was in a horribly abusive situation and needed the job. when I stepped away from these coworkers and stopped making these jokes, I thought that would be the end of it.

i have OCD, am autistic, and a visibly masculine/androgynous queer. i opened up too much about my identity while others were literally telling me their sex life, being crude, and ultimately were exhibiting behavior I should've reported first. I trusted them too much. even if I did hurt people, the way this was handled has left me in disrepair and absolute shock. i can't stop getting intrusive thoughts ‚Äî being told I was terminated, all the sexual jokes they would tell me, the pictures I was sent or shown, the idea of them laughing behind my back that they won. they got me fired. and I don't know what I did to deserve this. i wasn't told of any specific behavior. i was just told I was unsafe to work with because of the jokes I make.

the co owner said he would allow me to speak my side if I wanted to because of how obviously remorseful I was. i think in his voice he was concerned something else was going on. I said I understand the termination is final, and that you're only just getting this info now, and I would never wish to deny that someone is uncomfortable around me if they said that, but went on to explain the situations I was put in before I decided to pull away and change my behavior. he said he would definitely be having a conversation with the people I mentioned but I have really low hopes if this is how far they would go to harm someone they just occasionally found annoying to work with.

sorry this was so long. I'm still trying to process it. the few friends ive told have been really supportive and understanding, saying it was pretty obvious social murder of a queer/autistic person. I'm still trying to assess my behavior and definitely understand how to do better going forward, but even while over-analyzing everything I ever did while on shift, I can only think of times people came to me and were sexual and crude. i still don't want to deny someone's experience if I did make them uncomfortable though.

at least it was just a stupid coffee shop. I'm about to graduate, and will hopefully actually get a job in the field I want, as much as slinging coffee was fun for me. ",2,1746111222.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.75,False

Lately Ashley‚Äôs problematic behavior has leaked into our friendship and I am having trouble navigating it. It all started a couple of months ago. I have been single for a while after coming out of a VERY toxic relationship. She was my BIGGEST supporter and hype woman. We live in a small-ish town and she knows everybody so when we would go out she would introduce me to different guys she knew. She introduced me to this guy, we‚Äôll call Bryan, and his friend. I thought Bryan was super cute and we had a lot of the same interests, but I was so out of practice I leaned on my friend to help me. After a while I started noticing some signs like she was interested. I asked her if she liked him and she said ‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôre right, I do. Thank you for saying that. I would have never noticed if you didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù almost in tears and she hugged. She broke up with her boyfriend that day and started dating Bryan that night. I was a little taken back, but for the next couple of months, they were so in love I‚Äôve never seen anyone like that before so I chalked it up to the fact that they were soulmates or whatever.¬†

So Ashley is living with ex-boyfriend (still sleeping in the same bed) and dating her new boyfriend. But again, her problems, her life!¬†

I‚Äôm getting better at meeting people and she‚Äôs learning how to chill out and we get even closer as friends. But one day we‚Äôre out and a friend of ours introduces me to this guy and I find him incredibly boring. When he gets up to go to the bathroom Ashley asks ‚Äúare you interested in that guy?‚Äù and I say ‚Äúno way!‚Äù and she goes ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs so cute‚Äù and when he comes back they flirts for the rest of the night and go home together. The next day she breaks up with her boyfriend and starts hooking up with this new guy. Again, here problems, her life! I didn‚Äôt like that guy anyway!

Recently I‚Äôve been getting a lot of attention from men and I‚Äôve had some new-found confidence. I haven‚Äôt seen Ashley in a week or so because of life things. I mention that I‚Äôm talking to a lot of different guys and say how excited I am for this one guy, Robert. I show her a picture of him and she says ‚ÄúI saw him out the other night and I decided to put him on my potential roster‚Äù and I replied ‚ÄúSorry, but I‚Äôm already talking to him.‚Äù She seemed SO upset and said ‚Äúlet me just be upset for a second and I‚Äôll get over it‚Äù

But all of this brings me to last night. We are out watching some live music and Robert is going to come join us. Our other friend canceled and she is now the third wheel to our awkward first date/hang thing. Robert and I are talking and I quickly notice this guy is an incredibly rude guy. I guess he‚Äôs nervous, but his ‚Äújokes‚Äù are coming across borderline sexist and racist. And he is taking up most of the conversation. I felt so guilty for inviting this guy and even worse for making my friend be the 3rd wheel to this train wreck. Her ex-boyfriend, Bryan, is there and she mentions wanting to invite him to our table. When I tell her that‚Äôs too messy, she goes over to him to bring him to our table. When Robert gets up to go to the bathroom I say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry he is so annoying.‚Äù and she says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so‚Äù and when he comes back she instantly starts flirting with him. I get up and literally sprint out the door. I know I was supposed to be her ride home, but I couldn‚Äôt stop my knee jerk reaction of running away.¬†

I‚Äôve tried to let her be her, but last night made me feel like all of this is just one big competition and I am just a pawn to her. I know I didn‚Äôt want these men anyway. But how do I approach this conversation with her especially after I messed up by abandoning her as her ride. (Disclosure: She lives a 10 minute walk from the venue. The venue was a small coffee shop that is open late for live music.)",48,1746111166.0,TwoHotTakes,65,0.91,False

So I have this issue lately with my 4k60 pro, that seems to happen rather randomly. Basically the side of the screen, for a split second likes to flicker? I am unsure what is causing this. It's like a massive rectangle on the LEFT hand side, that is noticable if you look for it. I'll provide some video timestamps from my youtube channel to help clarify:

Hey ---,

It‚Äôs been a little while now and honestly, me not getting closure, given communication was one of our biggest things, it hurt a lot. I‚Äôve sat on this for a while now. Tears have fallen, and I know I‚Äôd regret not sending it. Now I know we didn‚Äôt end on a great note, but please, just take a moment to read this.

We may not have had a happy ending, but by God was it a magical beginning.

I just wanted to take a moment to say again how truly grateful I am to have met you. Getting to know you has been an awesome experience, and I'll always value, appreciate and treasure the time we spent together. There was so much joy, love and laughter in such a short space of time, I‚Äôd run out of paper had I put it all into words!¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

I went climbing the other day, and it instantly took me back to our first date, you remember? The one where seven hours flew by like five minutes. I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it was to be around you. Just you and me in our own little world without even trying. That‚Äôs how it always felt when I was with you. Time slipped by so fast, maybe that‚Äôs why I couldn‚Äôt get enough of you? I still remember how we, well eventually, held hands and just couldn‚Äôt let go. Like neither of us wanted to lose that connection. I remember how your smile lit up everything around us. It was so effortless, so natural, like we‚Äôd known each other forever.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

When we got to the pub, God, we hugged for so long. I think people were actually watching us! But I didn‚Äôt care. I just remember how good it felt to be close to you. To hold you.

And then, we kissed. I‚Äôll never forget the way you looked at me afterward and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been waiting for that all night.‚Äô That moment will always stick with me. It felt like we both knew exactly what we wanted, and in that moment, it was all there.

It‚Äôs kind of mental, isn‚Äôt it? How one day can leave such an imprint. We talked, laughed, opened up like we‚Äôd known each other forever. I‚Äôll never forget the hoard of questions we asked each other that day. It all felt so natural, like we‚Äôd skipped the awkward stage and went straight to something we longed. Something real. And honestly, I think that‚Äôs when I knew. Right then. You were the one for me.

I get that life had other plans for us. We both had our own things to work through. But that day, It‚Äôs still one of the most magical experiences I‚Äôve ever had. And I mean that. Even now, thinking about it, thinking about you, about us‚Ä¶ I still get butterflies. Not many things in life leave that kind of memory. But you did.

That said, I also understand and respect that we're currently at different places in our lives and in how we approach relationships right now.

As I mentioned before (I hope you read the letters üòÖ), even though our time together was brief, I'm genuinely glad that we gave it a shot. I am forever thankful for the memories we created and shared, no matter how small, they will always stay with me. I honestly cherish what we have. It‚Äôs not often a connection like this appears. Now I know we have our differences, but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs reason enough to throw it all away. Something so meaningful and true.

I'm sorry things didn't work out the way we had hoped. I know we cannot change the past, but I am sure this isn‚Äôt the outcome either of us wanted. I recognise that some mistakes and cockups were made along the way, and I take responsibility for them. They've made it clear that I still have some learning and growing to do myself, and I'm going to take that time, like you have, to focus on that journey.

I also hope you accept my apology for the way I acted over our final few days. Although your reaction and feelings are completely valid and understandable, it was never my intention to cause you any hurt. I was an idiot who crossed a boundary that you have every right to protect and forwent your trust with something that meant so much and hurt you so deeply in your past and I regret that. I am sorry. You‚Äôve overcome so much and you‚Äôre doing so incredibly well. You didn‚Äôt deserve the extra emotional baggage from me.

I know I was never perfect and that‚Äôs the thing with relationships. Traumas, flaws and challenges all begin to be exposed, even ones we didn‚Äôt know were there and I‚Äôm truly, truly sorry we couldn‚Äôt get past that. This time. I wanted to be and WANT to be there to help you through it all. If you‚Äôd allow me to. Not everything is necessarily going to go right, we‚Äôre human after all. But that‚Äôs where we need to stick together and figure out how these things work. I realise now, one of your vices is space and I apologise for not giving you that sooner.

Part of a relationship is learning, growing and understanding. So, thank you for giving me the chance. I'm so glad that, with you, we took this chance. You taught me so much. Not only about loving myself but also how to love others and how to be vulnerable. I hope you took something valuable from it as well. If you‚Äôre open to it, I would love to hear your perspective as well so I can take it on board, better understand everything and learn for the future.

Please know that I still do care about you deeply and have nothing but respect for you. You are such a wonderful, kind, amazing, adventurous and beautiful person. You're so funny, caring, intelligent, vibrant, passionate and you deserve nothing less than happiness. Within yourself and with others. And I'm glad I got to be the other person, even for this short time. I hope you realise being with you, brought back a smile I couldn't find, and joy I had lost. I truly hope you're able to continue healing, embracing and sharing your positivity, maintaining your compassion and taking care of yourself. Also, thank you for getting me into reading and into The Hunger Games! It‚Äôs sooooo good üòä I‚Äôm just listening to the book and cannot wait until the film comes out next year!

I completely understand and respect that you are not currently in a place for a relationship, I just hope we can kinder our feelings and maintain a friendship for the foreseeable. I must say that it hurts sometimes to see you doing so well without me, because you brought so much happiness into my life. But more than anything, I‚Äôm genuinely glad you‚Äôre okay and thriving. I‚Äôll always respect your decision and carry care for you in my heart.

You are so full of kindness, patience and passion. I am deeply in awe of your ability to care for and support other people, something I learned from you. I‚Äôm sorry if it appears I took that for granted. It is something I deeply miss, to this day. I also miss; the laughter, the tears, those eyes growing and glowing at me with lust, the scent of sea salt and Neroli filling my heart with every thought of you, of which I have had many since. And your company. You have so much love and joy to spread to the world. I honestly hope you succeed. I will always support you from afar.

I have realised now my fear of abandonment made me smother you and suffocate you. It made me cling to tightly, jeopardising what we had. However, I have learnt my way to regulate my emotions and insecurities shouldn‚Äôt have been to lean on you when you needed the opposite so dearly. I truly am sorry. I understand now that you have walls that go up when you feel the need to and instead of waiting, allowing and assisting you to take them down brick by brick, I came in like a sledgehammer coming at full force trying to knock them down. I can see now how this affected you. I hurt someone I truly care about and for that, I ask for your forgiveness.

I'll always be here to care, support and be there for you if you need anything, even if it's just someone to talk to. You know how to reach me. You're more than welcome to send reels or TikTok‚Äôs if you'd like! They always made my day. (Btw, I'm so proud of you! You're smashing it! ¬†And inspiring so many people :))

I'll be up every month or every other month, and when I feel ready, I'll reach out. Please don't hesitate to do the same if you ever feel like talking or reconnecting. I will forever be available, at any time.

For now, though, I'll give you the space that you deserve, and I think we both need, and I'm honestly so sorry for not respecting that in the past and giving it to you sooner. I noticed you pulling away and I should've done what was needed. Instead, I lost you. I have a hard time overthinking, as you know, and my Brain gets the better of me and I catastrophize causing me to freak out and reach out. Something I need to work on and I‚Äôm learning not to act on those impulses.

Life is hard. Just know, that with you in it, it was a little easier.

Anyway, I genuinely hope that in time, if it feels right for you, we can reconnect, maintain a friendship and allow me to show you a better me. I'd love to still be a part of your life in some way and be involved in any plans down the road, if and when it feels right for both of us.

I understand I broke that bond of trust; all I ask is for the opportunity to gain that back.

Look, I‚Äôm aware that you owe me nothing, however, I must ask if at some point when I‚Äôm in the area if we may sit down and have a conversation about it all. Over a coffee maybe? There is so much more I want to say and show you, no, prove to you. That I really hope you‚Äôll consider this. In your own timeframe of course. The best relationships are the ones that start over. Not from the beginning, but acknowledging where things went wrong and deciding to rebuild. And building a new, stronger foundation. Now I‚Äôm not saying it will be easy, but nothing worth fighting for in this life is. I‚Äôm not asking to go back to how it was, but hoping we can try to be something stronger, wiser, more honest. Because life is too short to let go of something and someone that could still be everything. Nobody is promised tomorrow after all. I hope you‚Äôll allow me that chance.

Who knows what the future holds.

I hope in time we can remain friends. If you‚Äôd allow me to, I would also love to come and support you at your final show. However, I understand completely if you‚Äôd prefer I didn‚Äôt.

I never lied when I said those three words you know. And although over time its meaning may shift, it will never disappear. Whether as a Friend, a memory or something more. You will forever be embedded in my heart.

If this is goodbye, then thank you. For the time, the love and the memories. I will cherish them forevermore. Take care of yourself, I wish nothing but the best for you. I will always root for you and your happiness and I hope to reconnect in the future.

Thank you for letting me be a character in your story. ¬†And remember, we‚Äôre all just trying our best.

I really do hope you reach out, even if it‚Äôs only to say goodbye,

Goodbye for now. Take care xx

I (16F) went on my first real date with a guy I met through a mutual friend. Let‚Äôs call him Jake. He‚Äôs 17, seemed chill over text, kinda funny, and cute in that messy-hair, skater-boy way. We‚Äôd been chatting for a few weeks and he finally asked if I wanted to go grab coffee and walk around downtown. I said yes because I thought he actually liked me and wanted to spend time together.
Anyway, we meet at this local caf√© and the moment we step inside, he immediately starts talking to the barista. Like‚Äînot just a ‚Äúhey‚Äù or ‚Äúhow‚Äôs your day?‚Äù but full-on chatting. Turns out they went to the same summer camp or something? I stood there smiling awkwardly for five minutes while they caught up like long-lost siblings.
We finally get our drinks and start walking. I try asking about his music taste and halfway through my question, he spots someone walking their dog. And suddenly he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYo! Is that a Great Dane? That‚Äôs sick. What‚Äôs her name? Can I pet her?‚Äù I stood there sipping my iced latte while he bonded with the dog owner for ten minutes.

1kcajjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/1kcajjf/to_transfer_or_not_to_transfer_how_would_you/,To Transfer or Not To Transfer: How would YOU handle money being in the right place at the wrong time?,"Hello! I am wondering what all you wonderful YNABers would do in this situation:

Tl;Dr: Venmo not tracked. Money came into Venmo the same day money needs to go out through Venmo. Do I - (Venmo Inflow > Checking Account > Venmo Outflow) - keeping YNAB looking pretty

or (Checking Account + Venmo Inflow > Venmo Outflow)  - less money being electronically moved around  
  
The Details if you need them:

My Parents own my house. I send them the full amount of the mortgage payment each month, via Venmo. Let's say it's $1000. I do not have Venmo as a tracked account in YNAB, because I use it as a payment tool, not a holding account (typically 3 transactions total in a month).   
  
I also have a family member who sends me a ""gift"" each month to help with my rent payments, let's say $200- via Venmo. Can you see where this is going?

Usually, these two Venmo transactions happen on different days, But this month... I was busy yesterday, so I didn't do my usual Last Day of the Month assigning/paying process, and planned to do it today... but then the inflow came in today! So now my Venmo is showing has +$200. If I put in a transaction to send my full rent, Venmo will use the $200 and pull $800 from my checking account - which means YNAB will think I only paid $800 for rent this month, messing up my target (I'd snooze it) and more importantly reports. 

Would you take the L on having an accurate YNAB report, or would you add the extra step of transferring the $200 to checking, and then essentially back to Venmo, keeping YNAB nice and tidy?

Is there a third option I'm being dense by missing? I am only on my first cup of coffee, lol   ",2,1746110857.0,ynab,14,1.0,False

Imagine strolling into your neighborhood gas station to grab a soda, and right there‚Äînext to the lotto machine and the coffee pot‚Äîis a glowing machine that doesn‚Äôt spit out cash... it spits out Bitcoin. You‚Äôve just encountered a **Bitcoin ATM**, one of the coolest inventions since sliced bread (and arguably more useful if you‚Äôre living that crypto life).

But wait‚Äîbefore you go throwing sats into the void, let‚Äôs break down what these magical machines actually do, how they work, and why our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker app** is the ultimate sidekick for anyone using them. Spoiler alert: it‚Äôs like peanut butter and jelly, only way more decentralized.

# üèß What‚Äôs a Bitcoin ATM, Anyway?

Bitcoin ATMs (or BTMs, if you're fancy) are physical kiosks that let users buy or sell Bitcoin with cash or debit cards. Think of them like traditional ATMs‚Äîbut instead of accessing your bank, you're diving straight into the world of decentralized finance. No suits. No paperwork. Just pure, peer-to-peer crypto action.

Some machines only let you **buy** Bitcoin (these are called ""one-way"" ATMs), while others let you **buy and sell** (the ""two-way"" flavor). Either way, the experience feels surprisingly sci-fi:

1. Tap the screen.
2. Scan your Bitcoin wallet QR code.
3. Insert cash.
4. Walk away with Bitcoin in your wallet.

In and out in under five minutes‚Äîquicker than a bank teller and about 500% cooler.

# üß† Why Bitcoin ATMs Are a Big Deal

Let‚Äôs face it: not everyone is a tech wizard with a MetaMask wallet and a stash of ETH on standby. For many people‚Äîespecially those new to crypto‚ÄîBitcoin ATMs are the gateway drug to decentralized finance.

Here‚Äôs why they rock:

* **Accessibility**: No bank account? No problem. All you need is a phone and a wallet app.
* **Privacy**: Most ATMs have low KYC requirements for small purchases.
* **Speed**: Buy Bitcoin instantly without waiting days for bank transfers.
* **Simplicity**: The interface is beginner-friendly. Grandma could probably use one.

It‚Äôs financial empowerment on-demand, and it‚Äôs popping up everywhere‚Äîfrom truck stops in Texas to hip caf√©s in Berlin.

# ü§≥ Enter the Bitcoin QR Code Maker App

I'm a Six-Figure‚Ñ¢ virtual and in-home trainer to the silent rich, I work for myself 30 hours a week or less, and my life looks an awful lot like semi-retirement in a HCOL area 30 years ahead of schedule.

I don't sell cohorts, programs, seminars, subscriptions, supplements, ads, apps, or coaches-coaching-coaches products.

My only social media is a weekly newsletter.

Like many of us, I'm just a simple personal trainer at heart.

Now if you measure a trainer by his *crisp-hundred-dollar-take-home-bills*‚Ñ¢ ...

Well, that makes me a 1% trainer in North America, and my accountant works hard to keep it that way.

I love what I do, and it loves me back.

But I don't feel like I'm the 1% of our industry, because I've been mentored by them.

When I see the 1% among us I see them for their razor sharp skill, mastery of the craft, a body of work which speaks for itself, and their relentless pursuit of improvement each day.

Not by their *crisp-hundred-dollar-take-home-bills*‚Ñ¢, which they usually have plenty of anyway.

But maybe your measurement is money, so let's talk about that today, and maybe by the end of this, you'll decide that being a 1% trainer based on your mastery of the craft sounds pretty nice too.

So I‚Äôm going to try to teach the two fundamental skills I've learned from both kinds of 1% trainers to which I credit my success, so that you too can have what I have if that‚Äôs what you want.

And I'm going to hand-hold you through them because that's how you teach a skill to the unskilled until they can perform it for themselves.

And should you master these skills, I hope you too will pass them on one day.

Like I said, I'm on a mission for the aspirants today.

Which brings us to fish.

Every day, an endless, unyielding tide breaks upon the shores of r/personaltraining washing up the aspiring, gasping for air on our beloved horse stall mats.

Flopping fish that somehow learned to mouth the words ...

* *how I be trainer??*
* *muh passion, advice?? :D*
* *hate my job >.<!!*
* *help!! how study D:*
* *which cert!?*
* *69 bmi okay for trainer??*
* *online trainer first how!?*

All served up with a side helping of misspelled one-pump-chump sentences or a rubic's cube wall of text.

Is this you?

Someone link you this thread so you could get your head screwed on straight and enjoy a great career because they see some potential in you?

Found it through google because you don't want your life to be someone else's cautionary tale?

Think making 1% money or forging 1% mastery of craft is in your future?

That maybe, those *crisp-hundred-dollar-bills*‚Ñ¢ have your name on 'em?

Well, read on.

# # Lollipops or Medicine

\--

I worked EMS in my former life.

Teaches you some cold harsh truths about people and mother nature when you're scraping poor bastards off asphalt.

Took me around the block a few times, learned a few things.

Learned when it comes to the sick and dying you can give out lollipops, or some medicine.

>***For when you treat only symptoms, you only prolong the pain and suffering of the patient. Given enough time, the patient will become your victim.***

*""Papa Northwest\_Iron, what's wrong with Billy over there, is he sick?""*

*""Well son, Billy over there only got himself lollipops, platitudes, regurgitated slop and a few attaboys when what he really needed was his head screwed on straight 10 years ago and a megadose of bitter truth today. ""*

*""Anyway, I wouldn't worry about him too much kiddo, he may just be one of those people who loves the feel of a hospital bed, or learning things the hard way. Maybe he'll come around when he fucks his life up.""*

**Now wake the-fuck-up and pay attention Billy.**

Northwest\_Iron doesn't hand out lollipops to the sick and dying, he gives 'em medicine if they want it.

It's time we teach you how to drag yourself out of that hopsital bed so that one day you can be among the best of us.

And if I'm great at anything, it's working with human nature, not barbells.

I know that the best medicine is bitter as fuck. Swallowed plenty of it myself to know that.

Can't force-feed it to people, never works and it never will. You gotta put people at ease, come at things from an angle and not head on, and in most cases wrap that shit up in cheese.

So, what's the medicine you ask? Well, it's ...

>***1. Tools that work.***

>***2. Tools you can actually use.***

>***3. A standard for which you can measure yourself.***

>***4. And a system for learning what you don't know, what you don't know.***

Kind of sounds like how you train clients. Wow, crazy.

So Billy, max out the incline on that hospital bed of yours, put down those *Self-Esteem‚Ñ¢ and Self-Acceptance‚Ñ¢* lollipops you're clutching, and let's get you back among the living.

Today I'm going to teach you the only two tools you'll ever need to save your own life.

>***1. How to pour yourself a bowl of OODA loops for breakfast every day.***

>***2. And how to write a field report so you don't completely fuck up your life.***

Let's get to work.

\--

# # Observe > Orient > Decide > Act

\--

Listen Billy I get it, it's not easy knowing how to get somewhere when you're feeling a bit lost.

You don't know what questions to ask, much less how to organize it all together and take action on it.

Which brings us how to pour yourself a bowl of OODA loops.

This is how you're going to give yourself direction when you are lost, apply what you actually manage to learn, and start living your life with some foresight and purpose.

I didn't come up with this, thank John Boyd of the US Air Force, made the model so fighter pilots could stay in the air and not the ground.

It's one of the best models we got when it comes to making sure you don't fuck up your life or waste our time.

It's also one of the best models around for delivering top tier results to your clients.

The faster you can learn to run an OODA loop in your life, the faster you can fix the problems in your life.

You probably ran an OODA loop unknowingly when it comes to your batman origin story.

>***What's your batman origin story, you ask?***

>***Well, it's that thing you vomit up every time you explain why you're passionate about fitness.***

No one really cares about it except you, but we love making people happy around here so we indulge you.

Fortunately, it's the perfect example of OODA looping itself over and over.

You **OBSERVED** something you didn't like, something you weren't going to tolerate anymore. Saw yourself in the mirror, suffered some heartbreak, had a mental breakdown, looked down and couldn't see your junk, lost the big game.

You **ORIENTED** yourself to the consequences of your actions and the possible benefits of changing your behaviors. Maybe you did it to get laid, get your dream job, to stop setting yourself on fire to keep others warm because you don't like 3rd degree burns anymore, figured out winning is better than losing.

And you made a **DECISION**. Maybe you decided to hit the gym, clean up your diet, take responsibility for your health or mental well-being for once, that you're a winner and not a loser.

And then you put that into **ACTION**. You jacked steel, boiled your chicken breasts, showed up to practice on time every time, hit the streets, or cracked open your textbooks.

And then you took some ***observations*** from your ***actions*** and ran through it again.

A nice big bowl of OODA loops, have one myself for breakfast each morning.

Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat.

Ever wonder why so many people become passionate about health and fitness to the point they insist the only reasonable option left in their lives is to turn it into their career?

Because for a lot of people, it was the first time they ever ran a set of OODA loops to completion and experienced first-hand how great it feels to be a winner and not a loser.

Problem is, most people never get conscious to the underlying mechanisms at play for their success so it just reverts to the mean of more flopping.

I'm passionate about coffee, you think I want to be a barista?

So, going forward, you're now going to ...

>***1. Observe the internal and external dynamics of your life.***

>***2. Orient yourself with the right mental models that actually work.***

>***3. Decide on the best courses of action to take using the tools you have.***

>***4. Action action action, baby.***

Because why? Well, your life depends on it.

So let's go down the list line by line.

\--

**## Observation**

You need to be curious about your life, look at it, play with it, and hopefully have enough common sense to reject internalizing being a victim of the things you **can't control** and instead focus on being in the driver seat for what you **can control**.

The more lost you are, the more looking you're going to be doing.

And you'll want an introspective system to be able to competently analyze your life and your world.

Personally, I use a physical commonplace journal to run OODA's laps and field reports, but that's another post for another day.

\--

**## Orientation**

Tools that work, you need them. We call them mental models.

>***Mental Models: Frameworks to understand and make sense of the world, systems, and people.***

The tough part is you need to learn which tools work, discard the tools that don't, and how to tell the difference between the two.

People develop emotional ego-investments into lousy mental models because they spent a lot of time or money on them, they can't admit they are wrong, or they don't have an accurate measure to evaluate whether they work or not so they just assume they work.

Reminds me of a stubborn child eating an onion while telling me it's an apple.

So your job now is to collect what works, discard what doesn't, and go out and play with your models slugger.

Read books, sponge mentors, take courses. Mental models are everywhere, and if it works, steal that shit and use it.

Need some examples to get started? I've already given you a good set to get started with throughout this essay, bolded for you in quote blocks.

And if your mental models don't work?

Well, give yourself the gift of having enough common sense to throw away broken toys.

\--

**## Decision**

Your decisions come with consequences and benefits. You'll need to keep running your OODA loops over and over to learn whether you applied the right models, in the right way, at the right time, with the right people, etc etc

If you put in some effort, it'll sort itself out over time.

\--

**## Action**

Listen Billy, no one can take a piss for you, still got to squeeze your own bladder at the end of the day even though I know you had a lot of fun with nurse John slipping that catheter in.

Action is action, you gotta do it for yourself, no one is coming to save you.

\--

**## Fear and Rejection**

Listen Billy, I get it. Fear of rejection, fear of making a mistake.

So here's a mental model for you to use, one Northwest\_Iron got a reminder of every time some poor bastard read him a last will and testament.

>***Rejection is better than regret. Don't live your life with regrets.***

\--

**## For the Practitioners**

Flopping professionals, this one is for you.

None of us are immune to breakdowns, no matter how skilled we are.

I have plenty of breakdowns myself, but I'm lucky to have the tools and good sense to run another lap of OODA and write a field report for my own good.

My first iteration of this essay bombed, one response. A *""not bad, but I know you can do better if you're serious about helping people""* for which I am grateful.

So I ran my OODA laps, learned I was attacking things backwards. Wrote myself a field report, what do I want out of this, who am I actually helping. Came to some decisions about my mental-models being misapplied with a heaping side of nasty ineffective ego-investments.

And here's v2.0. Let's see if it'll need a v3.0, v4.0, or v5.0.

Half the reason people don't follow your coaching is that too often you're attacking the wrong end of OODA, you're overly attached to actions or the outcome rather than starting from the beginning and going step by step with observations.

Or worse, trying to spoon-feed your ***ego-invested OODA*** to a client when the job requires ***assisting*** the client in doing it for themselves, and helping them commit to the process of growth and self-discovery.

Backwards thinking, backwards results.

But all too often, the real breakdown predictably simply boils down to just plain old ***garbage ego-invested mental models*** that don't work or don't fit.

Like a child trying to shove a square block in a circle hole.

No champ, spitting on it isn't going to help.

Need an example for the floppers in the back?

Do you think that prescribing *Self-Esteem‚Ñ¢* or *Self-Acceptance‚Ñ¢* lollipops are better than treating root causes? How's that working out for everyone, who does that really help.

I know the answer, but I want to hear you say it out loud for us.

**Anyway, back to you Billy.**

I hope you were paying attention in high-school English because fortunately for you, I'm going to spoon-feed how you write us a field report.

And unfortunately for us, we're all going to read it.

# # Writing a Field Report

Billy, come closer, this is important.

I need you to take out your feeding tube for a minute and pay attention to me bud.

We're going to put everything you've learned until now into one of the most essential life skills you can possess.

Field reports.

>***Field Reports: These suckers compile your observations, experiences and analyses from your OODA's so you, and a community, can chew it all up and make an informed tactical decision that has you winning, not losing.***

You're going to create a document you can actually use, refer back to later and re-run OODA from, and we as a community have something useful from which to give you advice and swap notes.

Remember this.

This is really fucking important.

There are three kinds of knowledge in life.

>***1. There's what you know.***

>***2. There's what you know, that you don't know.***

>***3. And there's what you don't know, that you don't know.***

If you don't have a system for figuring out what you don't know what you don't know, what hope will you ever have on improving and correcting your blind spots.

No one sees the truck about to crush 'em when their head is turned, and that's what you don't know that you don't know.

Field reports save lives, it why the military and EMS jerks off to them every minute of every day.

And it could save yours, or at least save you a lot of unnecessary trouble in your life.

Here's the thing about field reports, it's a skill in and of itself, anyone with time in EMS or the military can tell you this.

We don't expect perfection, we know you're going to screw it up because most of us screwed it up when we were in your shoes.

You're going to vomit a bit here, leave out some important details there, and misapply some lousy mental models, because right now you don't know what's pertinent and what isn't. It's how learning any new skill works. Field report or back squats, same thing.

You don't have to answer all this, but maybe you should. Might save you a lot of headaches and heartache down the road.

If you don't know what to write, just write down a few thoughts anyway, you'd be surprised what comes to you when you do that. We can always edit in post.

And as you go through this, notice how this is a tool that can be applied to any area of your life because ...

>***Foresight teaches gently, mistakes teach brutally.***

Do your best, and we'll call that good enough for now.

Do you see and understand the difference in quality and tactical decision-making capacity here between the slop we see day in and day out from the flopping 80%?

Here, you tell me. How many of your questions were answered just by filling this out?

How much more clear and focused are you now on the mission and vision of your life?

And this is just a basic template, the possibilities for self-exploration and discovery are endless.

We have people routinely asking how they can find mentors, how they can sponge from them.

This is it. You take this before a community, with humility and respect, and you'll find the world opens its doors to you.

I've had exchanges with some of the best coaches in the world, not because I'm so great.

The opposite exactly, I made myself a field report so I'm not a flopper to them, asked them pointed concise questions with respect and humility, and surprise surprise.

>***Ask and ye shall receive, knock and the door shall be opened.***

And over time, as you become more skilled with your field reports, you add mental models. Third-order-decision-making, risk-to-reward ratio, Eisenhower quadrants, etc etc

It becomes a document that talks to you, shows you the way, and you can take it to others for help and guidance so you can learn what you don't know that you don't know from the experienced and the experts.

You got seasoned veterans roaming the racks here. 5, 10, 20, 30+ years of experience under their belts.

Industry leaders. Subject-matter experts. Entrepreneurs. Owners. Influencers.

Big-swinging-cheesewheel-dick-energy kind of guys and gals.

And if there is one lesson you can take away from r/personaltraining it's that we just can't fucking help ourselves when fish flop in here with their heads screwed on halfway straight and ask for our help.

And who knows, maybe one day I get greedy, decide I need more of those *crisp-hundred-dollar-take-home-bills*‚Ñ¢.

Well, lucky me because ...

**If I wanted to scale another $50-100k today, and reward myself with the headaches that come with that, I could do it in 12 months or less.**

Bold words. How you ask?

Write my field reports, post pointed questions to my fellow experts with respect and humility, and then politely sponge these veterans dry into an OODA loop of action action action.

Rinse, repeat.

You don't need to ""invest"" 2, 8, or 15 easy payments of $497 on a coaches-coaching-coaches product to get to Six-Figures‚Ñ¢, although I value hiring a great coach myself when you need one.

Some of the best of the best are already right in front of you, and they love helping others.

The world helps those, who help themselves.

# # Call to Action

\--

To all the Billy's still with me who've made it this far.

Go post your field report, and do it with confidence.

And not just to r/personaltraining but with respect and humility everywhere you find professionals and communities that have something you would like to share in.

Done? Good.

Good work today Billy, good job dragging yourself out of your hospital bed with your own two hands.

I truly mean that by the way, you should feel good about yourself because this stuff isn't easy and it isn't obvious.

Welcome to the righteous path of saying goodbye to your fellow floppers and sloppers for good.

*""But Coach Northwest, I don't see the crisp-hundred-dollar-bills*‚Ñ¢ *anywhere??""*

My son, they are all around you.

Rather than give you a fish, my little flopper, I've taught you how to fish.

>***Root causes, OODA loops, mental models, field reports.***

Use them, you could save a life. And that life might just be yours.

>***For when you treat only symptoms, you only prolong the pain and suffering of the patient. Given enough time, the patient will become your victim.***

You can't just talk, ego-invest, and emote your way to real change.

You gotta give people ...

>***1. Tools that work.***

>***2. Tools you they actually use.***

>***3. A standard for which they can measure themselves.***

>***4. And system for learning what we don't know, what we don't know.***

*""Hey coach, where's #3, I don't see a chapter for it anywhere??""*

My brother in Iron, this whole 4,605 word essay is #3. Screw your head on straight bud, I put a lot of work into this.

And for some people, the stubborn, the stupid, and the lazy, if you're truly serious about helping them in the long run, the best way you can do that is to accelerate the consequences of their decision-making.

Trust me, they'll thank you later, because some people need to learn the hard way that ...

>***Foresight teaches gently, mistakes teach brutally.***

My friend, little of this will be easy.

But who ever found value and purpose along the easy path.

And if all this is new information to you, well, my heart goes out to you because that's not fair. But unfortunately life isn't fair.

And if there's only one lesson I can impart to you along your journey, it's this.

**If you commit to yourself, eat your OODA loops every day, and write yourself up some field reports to study and share with a community when you're feeling lost and need some direction in life.**

Well, you're gonna go far kid.

Now get out there and show us what you're made of champ.

And enjoy those *crisp-hundred-dollar-take-home-bills*‚Ñ¢.

See you at the Iron,

1kcadlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1kcadlf/betterme_will_coconut_water_break_a_fast/,BetterMe: Will Coconut Water Break a Fast?,"If you're doing intermittent fasting, you're likely careful about what you consume during your fasting window. While plain water and black coffee are obvious safe choices, **what about coconut water**? It sounds healthy and natural‚Äîbut does it actually break a fast?

**Short answer:** *Yes, coconut water will break a fast.*  
Here‚Äôs why:

# üîç Why Coconut Water Isn‚Äôt Fast-Friendly

Although it‚Äôs low in fat and protein, **1 cup of unsweetened coconut water contains:**

* **60 calories**
* **8 grams of sugar**
* **15 grams of carbs**

Even though it‚Äôs unprocessed and natural, **these calories and sugars can trigger an insulin response**, breaking your fast and pulling you out of ketosis.

# ‚úÖ Health Benefits of Coconut Water (During Your Eating Window)

That said, coconut water *does* offer some great benefits‚Äîjust save it for your eating window. It may:

* **Replenish electrolytes** (great after exercise)
* **Support heart health** (rich in potassium for blood pressure)
* **Aid digestion** (hydrating and possibly anti-inflammatory)
* **Promote bone health** (helps reduce calcium loss)
* **Assist blood sugar control** (in moderation)
* **Prevent kidney stones** (boosts citrate levels)

# ‚ùå When to Avoid Coconut Water

Be cautious if:

* You have **kidney disease** or **high potassium levels**
* You‚Äôre taking **diabetes or blood pressure meds**
* You‚Äôre close to a **surgery**
* You‚Äôre drinking it on an **empty stomach while fasting** (can upset digestion or spike potassium too fast)

20s, f, living with parents in college... she's never really wanted me to move out. And last time I tried my parents tried to convince me i was being groomed (what lol). They also keep telling me that i shouldnt get a job just yet either lol. (and i should just get paid doing chores or whatever... its dumb and thats not an actual job thats just normal chores...)

I 100% was not, especially since nobody was telling me to move out. My mom was like upset and stuff and yeah i get it but still.

She doesn't want me moving out cause she thinks i'll get assaulted and possibly killed and wants me to stay at home till marriage(im not marrying but ok). Idk I dont have the means to go through college right now without financial help and theyre thankfully payng.

My dad is sorta ok with me moving out and has suggested i check colleges specifically far from home. Alls well... but like my mom might have munchausens syndrome by proxy but not as severe as some... she would tell me i have an allergy to this food i remember enjoying. Told me that since her stomach hurt after I ate something my siblings and I shouldnt eat it too. I was a sick kid but got healthy and the following issues kinda started around after i tried to leave (albeit without a good plan but i just REALLY thought i had to get out).

\-lots of paranoia. Like to the point I'm pretty sure the coffee is dosed... occasionally I stop thinking about it but then something pops up that makes me go ""nah im 100% being dosed"". I feel like its so i can't really move out, so i seem to be developing mental health issues.... ect. ' Kinda paranoid that my dads hiding secret cameras cause he occasionally jokes about it and occasionally jokes about drugs(like why?)

Admittedly I did also, during the middle of my last semester, have alot of what i guess sounded like hallucinations and even more paranoia and everything. I sense entities frequently and the hearing things only really happens if im stressed/in full swing studying or other stressors.

Quit coffee and... after a month of quitting coffee suddenly I could genuinely get into a daily routine and started getting things done. Then I had a coffee yesterday and got nothing done the rest of the day... almost... my mood went from meh to happy then back to meh.

Admittedly got 0 withdrawls after quitting coffee, so like... ??? it cant be like actual illegal drugs cause that has withrawls so if anything im drinking is spiked then it would have to be a med causing paranoia? Ik some can

My moms been weird about some things too, like way too ok with them... she took a pic of a note i wrote and told me how much she loved the handwriting(in the past shes critisized my handwriting and i genuinely wrote that note with a marker and just only cared that the letters were big. I took too long doing something I shouldve done very quickly and she was way too understanding... like i expected her to be upset?

I dont think she was being sarcastic. She once told me i could just go work for the gov and then go on disability when i don't have any reasons to do so? I suspct i have some level of autism sometimes due to reasons but genuinely what the heck). Yeah maybe this is all just paranoia but like... dude what. She's way too understanding that i failed courses. I figured she just thought im a bit delayed(shes stated this directly too). Not sure whats going on.

Also me having a mental issue developing... ok so I was't hospitalized, I've had this issue on some level for all of last year and its sorta increased but also not that much? I went to the therapist myself instead of having someone else tell me to which is something I feel that I wouldntve done if i legitimately was developing an issue???  I get you can be sorta aware but... welp. I get that it sounds really paranoid to suggest that i'm being drugged by something.... Was paranoid it was my dad putting something into the coffee (or somewhere)...now idk. 0 symptoms of being high aside from lots of paranoia.

Oh also it sometimes just stops? Like everything. Completely stops. If this was psychosis how tf am i some level of functional after a whole years

Went to a therapist who's like ""yeah you have issues developing"" I partly feel like he doesn't actually believe that but his actions show that yeah he does and also not getting something like that put through insurance. Also he straight up said i had psychosis delusions and hallucinations... but like if he actually thought that why say it right??? I'm still going to go to my therapist and everything but atp I feel like the best thing is to move out however I don't have a degree and i'm falling behind in my courses soooo yeah thats not good. I should just do tradeschool atp lol. On the oter hand I don't want to fail college so ill persevere.

Also I don't have negative symptoms. Yeah I wasn't brushing well or I wasn't getting anything done all day... yeah i get that my facial expressions are really just not there alot of the time... but guess what got better after I quit coffee, figured i might have autism and just need a strict routine? Got my room cleaned, brushing my teeth daily, focusing, actually doing more in a day, ACTUALLY being productive. Actually getting things done. Maybe its just an everyone thing with the routine but like.. having a strict daily ritual (wake up, do a hang motion, make bed, brush teeth, wash hands/face in that specific order. Then something simmilar in reverse at the end of the day).

I'm moving into a new apartment soon and could really use some help visualizing and planning the layout for the main living area.

**What I Have:**

* From my old place, I'm bringing my desk, office chair, a floor lamp, and an Ikea FJ√ÑLLBO shelving unit (you can see this in the rough layout examples I've attached).

**The Space:**

* The room is approximately 4.5 x 4.5 meters (15 x 15 ft).
* It's connected to the kitchen.

**What I Need to Fit In:**

* A sofa
* A comfy armchair/bean bag (not sure yet)
* A coffee table
* A (large) rug
* A TV (planning on 77 inches)
* A TV stand
* Speakers
* My workspace (desk and chair) - I work remotely full-time.

**Key Considerations:**

* I want to be able to see the TV from my desk/workspace. This means the desk area needs to be fairly open to the rest of the room.
* My current thought is to place the desk behind the sofa. This way, my office chair would have open space behind it (maybe facing towards the kitchen area?) so I'm not constantly bumping against a wall.

**My Questions for You:**

1. **Layout Advice:** How would you arrange this furniture in the space? Does my ""desk behind the sofa"" idea make sense, or are there potential problems I haven't considered? I've never designed a room layout before, so I'm worried I might be overlooking something obvious! (Please see attached layouts for my initial idea).
2. **Furniture Suggestions:** If anyone has the time, I'd love recommendations for furniture pieces or general style directions. I'm looking for comfortable and colorful pieces. Style-wise, I lean towards mid-century modern and eclectic looks.

1kca9kx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kca9kx,Girl who was groomed and raped by her teacher told him she wanted to kill herself. He helped her buy the rope to do it,"#Trigger Warning 


A former SouthTech Academy teacher, Damian Conti, is facing charges of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and attempting to assist in self-murder.


Conti accompanied the 16-year-old student to a hardware store where she purchased rope and chain for a suicide attempt.





WEST PALM BEACH ‚Äî Investigators say the SouthTech Academy teacher accused of having sex with a student did more than groom and abuse her.

According to court records, he also made a suicide pact with the 16-year-old girl and accompanied her to a hardware store where she picked out a rope to hang herself.


Palm Beach County sheriff‚Äôs deputies found the teenager hanging from a tree behind a church less than an hour later.

The girl's attorney, Victoria Mesa-Estrada, said deputies cut the rope and resuscitated her before taking her to the pediatric intensive care unit of St. Mary's Medical Center in West Palm Beach, where she slowly recovered.



‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not only talking about a sexual predator, but someone who aided and abetted her suicide attempt,‚Äù Mesa-Estrada said. ""She committed suicide. She's alive by miracle.""





Damian Conti's arrest: Former SouthTech charter teacher faces charges of inappropriate relationship with student
Initially charged with several counts of unlawful sexual activity with a child, former AP English teacher Damian Conti, 36, now faces an additional count of attempting to assist in self-murder.

Prosecutors added the charge on April 16, months after suggesting in an email to Conti's attorney that an attempted murder charge may be pending.


""This case is much more than just the sexual abuse of a minor by a teacher,"" Assistant State Attorney Alexa Ruggiero told Assistant Public Defender Lily Boehmer in an email made public this month. ""Some of the most upsetting evidence includes the defendant taking this young girl to the store to buy materials to end her life.""



There is other evidence ""to corroborate his involvement with her attempted suicide,"" Ruggiero said.



Conti, who was seen accompanying the student as she picked out 30 feet of rope and 15 feet of chain, has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. The Greenacres man is represented by the Office of the Public Defender, which, as a policy, does not comment on open cases.



According to investigators, Conti began communicating with the student over school email, text and Instagram in August 2023.


He offered to serve as the girl's academic mentor and created after-school meetups near her locker, where he greeted her every day.



Attorneys for the girl's family said he gave her driving lessons and met her at Starbucks for coffee. He sometimes visited her where she worked, his 4-year-old son in tow.


He gave her gifts and encouraged her to join the volleyball club he coached.


By the end of the first quarter, investigators say he had begun creating excuses to remove her from volleyball practice and take her into his classroom alone. The student said he confided in her about his work and home life and encouraged her to vent her own frustrations. As their trust deepened, he began sharing intimate secrets about his marriage and sex life.


The girl said Conti told her he ""liked her"" in October 2023. She said he then began to assault her sexually ‚Äî first in a shopping plaza parking lot and then in his classroom and in storage closets on SouthTech's campus in Boynton Beach.


Under Florida law, the age of consent is 18. Those who are 16 and 17 can legally consent only to a partner younger than 24.


Lawsuit: SouthTech school officials turned blind eye to teacher's sexual abuse of student
Conti's behavior, flagrant enough to start rumors among students, earned an emailed warning from a school administrator in January 2024, according to school records.


""I want to remind you that you should not be transporting students in your car,"" assistant principal Erin Kurtz wrote, after a video of the girl stepping into Conti's car began to circulate on TikTok. ""If you are transporting them for a field trip, the appropriate paperwork should be on file and there should always be a minimum of 3 people.""


According to court records, Conti told the girl that Kurtz had questioned him about inappropriate conduct with a different teen girl the year before. The student said he bragged about how quickly he'd convinced the assistant principal that the accusations were unfounded, then continued to assault her in secret.


Both Conti and the girl told deputies that their last sexual encounter occurred on Feb. 5, 2024 ‚Äî the same day as his wedding anniversary, according to the divorce paperwork his wife filed three weeks later.


Classmate discovered texts between student and West Palm Beach teacher, alerted principal
On Feb. 6, 2024, a classmate who shared access to one of the girl's online accounts said he wanted to ‚Äúmess with her‚Äù by logging into her Instagram and messaging her from it. It was also a chance to see whether she was ‚Äútalking smack‚Äù about him to friends, he said.


‚ÄúLo and behold, she was talking smack about me,‚Äù he told a deputy.


The boy said he scrolled through her conversations during his first-period class and noticed one ‚Äúcurious‚Äù message after another, between the student and an account appearing to belong to Conti.

The boy took screenshots and shared them with school administrators.


Eileen Turenne, SouthTech's then-principal, suspended Conti upon seeing the messages and summoned the girl to the front office. At about the same time, the girl said she began receiving texts from Conti, instructing her to delete their messages. She did.

In the office, the girl said she ignored the principal‚Äôs questions and asked for an attorney. She said Turenne asked her to leave campus without yet notifying her parents about Conti's suspension or the reason behind it.


According to court records, a SouthTech receptionist asked Turenne over a walkie-talkie to confirm that the student should be released from campus without her parents' signature.


""Yes. Get her out of here,"" attorneys said Turenne answered.



The receptionist asked again whether Turenne had written or verbal consent from the girl's parents, as was required by school policy.


""I will deal with it later,"" Turenne said, according to court records. ""Just tell (Jane Doe) to sign on behalf of her parent.""


The next time her parents saw their daughter was hours later in the emergency room. Intubated and comatose, she appeared in such grave condition that a deputy said her mother nearly fainted when she saw her.
Turenne, who retired from SouthTech three days later, did not return a request for comment.


""The school waited for the water to spill before they took any action to protect her,"" Mesa-Estrada said. ""And when they pushed her out, they basically turned her into the hands of the predator.""

After leaving SouthTech, the girl met Conti at a Home Depot near Lake Worth Beach. In-store surveillance cameras recorded Conti as he accompanied the student through the store.


She picked out 30 feet of rope and 15 feet of chain, and told an employee she was building a tree house. She told Conti it was for the both of them to commit suicide.

Conti changed his mind. The girl said he touched the rope, said he was ‚Äúscared of death‚Äù and told his student repeatedly not to kill herself. According to court records, he stood with her at the self-checkout while she bought the rope.


The pair then walked out of the store together and ‚Äúwent their separate ways.‚Äù
Conti told deputies later that he called his therapist and asked what he should do. The therapist told him to hang up and call 911. He did.


The call triggered a 30-minute search for the girl. Deputies found her hanging from a rope behind a nearby church with the help of her parents, who tracked her location through their phone.



Despite evidence against him, fired SouthTech teacher maintains his innocence


Deputies arrested Conti on Feb. 6, 2024, after he admitted that his sexual relationship with the girl, and his suspension from school because of it, precipitated her suicide attempt.

‚ÄúThere was feelings that shouldn‚Äôt have been there,‚Äù he told the arresting deputy. ‚ÄúI should have stopped it.‚Äù

SouthTech fired Conti the following day.


In addition to his admission of performing sex acts on the girl, investigators uncovered thousands of messages between the teacher and student ‚Äî many of which the lawyers said contained ""highly inappropriate and/or explicit sexual content.""

During a hearing in October, prosecutors offered the former teacher a chance to plead guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison sentence ‚Äî a fraction of the penalty he‚Äôll face if he maintains his innocence and is convicted at trial. Conti rejected the offer. He rejected a 10-year offer before that one, too.


His refusal put his case on track for a jury trial scheduled to begin June 23.

1kca9fh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OvenMasters/comments/1kca9fh/discover_how_the_whall_touch_screen_toaster/,Discover How the WHALL Touch Screen Toaster Stands Out Review Best Features!,"The WHALL KST075AU Touch Screen Toaster entered my kitchen as more than just an appliance‚Äîit promised to be a serious upgrade, and I couldn't wait to put it through its paces. Sleek and polished in its stainless-steel finish, this toaster not only claimed to streamline my mornings with its smart features but also added a touch of sophistication to my countertop. As someone with a deep love for gadgets and good bread, I had high expectations.

**Sophisticated Design and Build Quality**  
The device looks amazing in silver, with an elegant polished finish that blends seamlessly into both modern and traditional kitchens. Its compact dimensions (12.02""D x 9.25""W x 7.72""H) mean it fits easily into tight spaces, but it certainly doesn‚Äôt compromise on functionality. Those of you who, like me, are prone to accidentally dropping kitchen gear will appreciate its sturdiness, even when handling heavy-duty tasks like toasting artisanal bagels or thick sourdough slices. Also worth noting‚Äîthat spacious storage friendly size certainly doesn‚Äôt hurt.  

**Highlighting Its Advantages**  
- The extra-wide slots accommodate different bread types, including gourmet slices and thick bagels.  
- The LCD screen makes toasting totally stress-free, showing the exact remaining time.  
- Offers six bread types (from classic white to bagels) and six shade settings for every kind of toaster artistry you need.  
- Features such as defrost, bagel mode, and sound control give you an unparalleled range of options.  

**Usability and Everyday Experience**  
Interacting with this toaster feels futuristic, thanks to its easy-to-use touch screen and intuitive controls. There‚Äôs nothing like watching that bright LED timer counting down, all while sipping on your coffee. I've even noticed my partner, usually toaster-averse, taking an interest simply because it‚Äôs so interactive. It‚Äôs like having your bread cooked by a tiny AI chef. However, if some days, bleary-eyed mornings need fewer beeps, the mute button comes as a surprising lifesaver.

[Check WHALL KST075AU price on Amazon.](https://chpizza.com/p/b0cc5smlnt/)

**Downsides**  
While it certainly nails the basics, there are some areas worth mentioning where it doesn't score as highly:  
- The stainless steel, while beautifully polished, does pick up fingerprints rather easily, leaving you wiping it often.  
- Some users may find the sound alerts on the loud side before discovering the mute function.  
- Though it features a crumb tray for easy cleaning, crumbs still have a way of sneaking around the corners. A bit of extra effort is needed during cleanup.  

**Performance and Features**  
Its wattage of 850 watts ensures evenly browned results, even with frozen bread, which was a massive bonus during testing. Using defrost mode, I took frozen slices straight out of the freezer, popped them in, and was pleasantly surprised when it didn‚Äôt leave icy patches. The dedicated bagel mode is another stellar addition, toasting only one side while warming the other‚Äîa small detail with impactful results. The six shade settings allow for experimentation; my kids favor shade three, while I lean more towards five for golden crispness.

**Competitors in the Market**  
Looking at similar touch-screen toasters like models from Cuisinart or Breville, you'll notice subtle differences in execution. The Breville Smart Toaster, for instance, sports a lift-and-look functionality but runs considerably costlier. Meanwhile, Cuisinart provides durability but lacks the smart screen utility this one flaunts. For someone who appreciates a solid balance of tech and cost, WHALL has done a brilliant job, though perhaps slightly compromising on some higher-end touch functionalities.

**Was It Worth Every Penny?**  
Considering its smart features, multiple bread-type options, and stainless-steel durability, this toaster nails the price-to-quality ratio. Sure, its quibbles with fingerprints or crumb management might give you pause, but for the features packed into this relatively budget-friendly unit, you won't easily find such value elsewhere.

The kids have started waking up at the same time I wake up, so I don't have that half hour to drink coffee and compose myself anymore, and waking their father up at that time is a bigger fight than it's worth at 5 AM, if I go to the bathroom they follow me and yell questions through the door , louder and louder until I answer, when I get in the shower they stand outside it and talk to me and won't go away, when I get home from work, before the kids are out of school, my 87-year-old mom has taken the following me everywhere and getting violently offended if I ask for a few minutes of privacy (we live with her and there is not another option right now), once the kids are home from school there's no moment to get away, and my husband sleeps in the same bed with me and seems to feel the need to be affectionate at 3 AM when all I want is sleep.

I have to leave my house and go somewhere else to be alone. And if I do that I get panicked texts from mom and husband wondering where I am.

I thought it could add photos so I might be missing info or not saying it right. But I've been in a deficit for 2 months and not sure if I'm actually losing weight. 

I'm counting cals with chronometer. I stay around 1900-2000cals a day. My start weight is 270lbs. Every morning I weigh in 265-267lbs on my home scale. Yesterday I used a scale at the gym for a body scan and it stated I'm at 262. I punched my numbers in fat calc, a calorie deficit calculator. It stated I'm in a good deficit range but I don't even see a difference in my home scale or in the mirror. I can only use the gym scale once a month since it's in a locked room and it's a gym perk.  

I workout 4x a day focused on strength training. I walk to the gym so on those day I walk 3 miles total. On my rest days I walk 1 mile after breakfast. Drinking about 115oz in water, diet soda or coffee.

I think i should drop to 1800 cals or try to raise to 2100 cals. The gym scale state my BMR is 2326/cals but the fat cal says my BMR is 2100/cals. Idk what to do.

I am a 185 (6'1) male of 39 and quite slightly built. I am also not an athletic type. Even so I managed to get to 88kg (194lbs) which looked terrible - my stomach was protruding, I had cushions on my sides, fat under my chin and I could feel all that wiggle when I walked. I decided to act so my first step was to identify habits which make me gain weight - in my case those were late night dinners with bread, beer, alcohol in general, snacks like chips and big portions of everything. My plan - I kept coffee with milk and sugar in the morning, ate a light lunch - usually a salad with eggs/beans/chickpeas/tuna/veggies/leafy greens/cooked beef in various combinations and in the afternoon I ate some fruits and dry nuts. No dinner, no alcohol. No soda, no sugar, no chocolate or candies. In the next two weeks I lost half of what I planned and then it all stopped. I searched online and found out that my body likely switched to survival mode and slowed down the metabolysm so I wasn't losing any more weight. So I tried to add a day or two per week where I ate and drank as I would before and ""showed"" my body there is no emergency going on. It worked. My weight gradually went down to 78kg (174lbs). The downsides - I was hangry all the time so I had fights I probably wouldn't otherwise. Nevermind, it was worth it. Now I plan to reintroduce various foods, dinners and occasional drink, but keep the portions lower and not eating late.

Unfortunately it has two wheels detached from the legs, but I still have them. I'm looking at a few consignment shops and antique stores to sell, and I'm not sure of how to price it.

So we were looking for offers nearby and ended going to 'The Old Potion House' in Adyar. We had no expectations on this cafe to be this good!!!

Seriously, We've been to a lot of cafes and restaurants - but this place has really lip smacking foods.

We ordered Onion rings, Shanghai mushroom, Beef tenderloin steak, Mushroom & sun-dried tomato pizza, Harissa paneer steak, Veg lasagna, Pannacota, Cold coffee that had a strong flavor(the name was something different I don't remember)

So overall the food was really amazing - the beef was medium-rare, Lasagna was tangy and had the perfect italian taste, Pizza was good(not the best, but good), Harissa paneer was soft and had a unique flavor, Shanghai mushroom had 2 types lf mushroom and it was tossed in soy sauce which had a really hood umami flavor and was extremely hot. 

Coming to the dessert - I've had pannacota at different places, but this one is really the best and was extremely jiggly and flavorful. The cold coffee had a strong coffee flavor and had some ice cream taste to it.

Try this place if you're in adyar and let me know!!

My shoulder is jacked, rated 30% and both my VA Ortho Doc and a private one chuckled awkwardly and asked how old I was because it looks like it should be in a 70 year old who did heavy manual labor all his life.  They both said I will need a full replacement, that's not even a question, but being only 44 I should try to get as close to 50 as I can before the surgery so that I have a higher chance of only having to get it done once. That was last year and I've been doing pain management in the mean time.

My dilemma is that the cortisol shot isn't really working for pain relief anymore, a professional massage helps for like 3 days and then I'm back to babying the arm and chewing Motrin as my shoulder grinds and drinking a cup of coffee is a struggle. Next time I see the Ortho Doc I'd like to tell him I'm ok with getting a second replacement done at 65-70 if needed, given we do the first one now.

1kca1l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kca1l9/robusta_beans_swollen/,Robusta beans swollen?,"Hello. I tried making espresso with robusta bean for the first time.

I wa quite excited as they have my ""favourite beans smell"" so far.

I used the same gear I've been using for weeks now with various arabica beans:

* Machine:¬†*DeLonghi Dedica something*
* Grinder:¬†*KINGrinder K6*¬†set on 30\*.\*
* *H29C - IMS Precision Convex Filter Basket*¬†
* Puck screen: After trying some cheaper alternatives, I love using¬†*verybarista IMS Precision Puck Diffuser Screen by E&B LAB*
* Tamper: A random cheap tamper + WDT set from brand Piymnys Coffee

I place approximately the same quantity of bean that I usually use. I mean I fill the basket with beans and then transfer them to the grinder (I do not weight them).

I noticed that, after grinding, the ground beans took somewhat more volume that usual... I thought that must be because they are slightly smaller so they filled the gaps tighter.

But there still was space above the puck so I thought it's nothing to worry about.

When I started running the water, the machine processed a few drips and stopped. Re-tried, same, the machine stopped again.

After a few tries, I removed the portafilter and observed that the puck was swollen (at an impressive ration I mean), even coming slightly out (higher) of the basket.

The shower part of the machine had coffee on it despite the puck filter.

So I'd say it looked somewhat like a mess.

The few drips of coffee that went in the cup felt very ""muddy"".

Did I do something wrong?

Should I put less beans when filling the basket/grinder.

Is the puck expect expect to swell?

Is it because it's robusta?

Should I stay away from those given beans?",1,1746109565.0,espresso,3,1.0,False
1kca0mg,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1kca0mg/why_does_some_coffee_hurt_and_some_help/,Why does some coffee hurt and some help?,"For the past year or so I've been having 1-2 cups of cofee at work. It's not uncommon that I wake up with a headache, and I've found that my morning coffee often helps alleviate some of the pain. Yesterday the office was out of my regular coffe (the ""Caribou Blend"" from Caribou), so I instead poured a cup of the Veranda Blend from Starbucks. The pain got so much worse, I couldn't even finish the cup I had poured.

  
The most obvious difference between the two is that the Starbucks one is a light roast and the Caribou is a medium roast. There may be a slight caffeine content difference given the different roasts, but I'm hestitant to believe the marginal difference in caffeine content would induce a headache. They're both blends with fairly similar origins (Latin America for the Starbucks and Latin America + Sumatra for the Caribou). I don't use any sugar/creamer, but I do put in a protein shake. I've used the same protein shake in the Caribou coffee without issues, so I'm thinking that's probably not the cause. I'm just at a loss for how one coffee can consistently help my head pain and another can make it significantly worse. Thoughts?",9,1746109491.0,migraine,5,1.0,False
1kca0as,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/1kca0as/just_got_prescribed_pilocarpine_for_potential/,"Just got prescribed Pilocarpine for potential autoimmune disorder, confused + scared","Hi everyone,

First time posting here...

My doctor prescribed me Pilocarpine 5mg 3x/day, but I've been nervous to take it since I filled it last week. I've been trying to figure out with my doctor what's going on with me for several months, but I'm scared and confused because I don't have a solid answer on why I'm hurting so much. I'm nervous to start the med because I don't know if it will help me or hurt me more. 

I had recently resigned from a hostile workplace that made me clinically depressed and triggered the return of my PTSD that I'd been able to manage previously, but I've gotten a lot better and engaged in a lot of therapy. After leaving that job, I lost like 20% of my body weight even though I wasn't even changing my food intake or exercise routine, just like unexplained and rapid weight loss. I even had to get a colonoscopy even though I'm only 33, and it came back normal. All of my numerous labs have come back normal, except the B12 is slightly low.

I've been dealing with worsening fatigue, muscular and joint pain/stiffness (but Meloxicam prescription has helped me get around better, especially as this was aggravating my knee injury/plica syndrome from when I was hit by an SUV when I was 18 years old, I'm 33F), issues with concentrating on my tasks, extreme thirst (many days drinking as much as 210mg water plus a couple decaf coffees), dry eyes with almost sharp eye sand/grit in the corners, pins-and-needles sort of Raynaud's syndrome in my feet, dry skin no matter how much moisturizer/lotion I apply, recurrent breakouts of canker sores, intimate dryness, etc.

I also had developed what seemed to look like a malar rash for the first time a few weeks ago (raised, red, irritated, felt like skin was burning from the inside out, across cheeks, nose, and my under-eye area); that day I had the most unquenchable thirst ever, just couldn't stop drinking water and peeing. I was feeling pressure on my bladder constantly and struggling to feel like I was able to empty my bladder completely, but since then I've had a bladder ultrasound but it turned out ok. I felt like my salivary glands like ached and my throat ached too, it was so painful I couldn't help but cry, but also because I was scared of what's happening to me. I couldn't get a doctor's appointment until the next week, but by then a lot of those symptoms went away. To treat the rash, I used hydrocortisone cream, different skincare things, aloe vera, but I didn't even get much sun so it couldn't have been a sunburn especially as it was only March (Denver, CO).

I haven't been diagnosed with Sjogren's but I was prescribed the pilocarpine and I don't think my doctor is going to do much more to look into what's happening with me, but I still don't know why all that happened and is currently going on and I'm afraid of it getting worse. I'm also always afraid my doctors don't take my symptoms seriously because of my history with depression, PTSD, and anxiety.

Hoping for any support or insight, thank you so much.",1,1746109467.0,Sjogrens,1,1.0,False

Story Time:
Because of my ADHD, I forget words so friggen often, and so firmly I have to describe their meaning, I might even remember their multiple definitions verbatim but not the word itself. 

Sometimes it's so difficult to remember the word I can't even put its actual meaning into words, forcing me to find a different, similar word opposite or not and I'll end up blabbing something that sounds probably real but likely isn't.

Though sometimes I'll end up saying some stupid stuff like ""It's on the tip my tongue, it starts with a b!"" And it ends up being Worcestershire or something lmao


I'm so unfortunately cursed with this problem for names that I literally can't even get them wrong, I won't even remember a name similar to theirs, I couldn't even think of names at that point. I'd probably forget my own name if I persisted hard enough.

I don't know what it is with names, but the hell that is trying to remember names I can't see on a screen or haven't attached to a personality that I've memorized is perpetual, vicious, and will always infuriate people if they ever find out, especially if they're coworkers.

If I work at a company for 20 years, like a desk job where I've got cubicles left, right and center; if you haven't impacted me in any way directly, I will go 20 years without ever learning your name, and I'll get away with it by persistently avoiding introducing people and typically just saying hey dude, loud enough in your general direction you'll automatically assume I'm talking to you.

These machines are designed to brew large batches without sacrificing flavor or quality.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The functionality and efficiency of a 30 cup coffee maker hinge on several critical features. These elements dictate not only the brewing process but also the overall user experience.

**Brew Speed:** The time it takes to brew a full pot is a crucial factor, especially when serving a crowd.

Typically, a good 30 cup coffee maker should be able to brew a full batch in under 30 minutes. Models with faster brew times often incorporate enhanced heating elements and optimized water distribution systems. Look for specifications that clearly state the brewing speed to ensure it aligns with your needs. Some high-end models boast brew times as quick as 20 minutes, significantly reducing wait times during busy periods.

**Keep Warm Function:** Maintaining the coffee's temperature after brewing is essential to prevent it from becoming cold and unpalatable.

The keep warm function usually utilizes a heating element in the base of the coffee maker to keep the brewed coffee at an optimal serving temperature. Ideally, this function should maintain the temperature between 175Êé≥F and 185Êé≥F (80Êé≥C and 85Êé≥C) for several hours without burning or altering the coffee's taste. Advanced models may include adjustable temperature settings to customize the warming level to your preference.

**Water Level Indicator:** Accurately gauging the water level is essential for consistent brewing and preventing overflow.

A clear and easy-to-read water level indicator allows you to accurately measure the amount of water needed for each brew, ensuring consistent results every time. The indicator is typically marked with cup measurements, enabling you to precisely fill the reservoir. Some models feature transparent water tanks, providing a visual indication of the water level, while others use internal sensors to digitally display the remaining water.

**Durable Construction:** The longevity of a coffee maker is directly tied to the quality of its materials and construction.

Look for models constructed from high-quality materials such as stainless steel, which is known for its durability and resistance to corrosion. The carafe material is also crucial; stainless steel carafes are more durable and better at retaining heat compared to glass carafes. Reinforced handles and sturdy bases contribute to the overall stability and longevity of the appliance.

**Easy-to-Clean Design:** Maintenance is a key consideration for any appliance, and a coffee maker should be easy to clean and maintain.

Features like removable brew baskets and dishwasher-safe components simplify the cleaning process. Models with smooth, easy-to-wipe surfaces minimize the effort required to keep the appliance clean. Descaling indicators and self-cleaning cycles further enhance the ease of maintenance, ensuring the coffee maker remains in optimal condition for years to come.

**Dispensing Mechanism:** A reliable dispensing mechanism is essential for serving coffee efficiently and without making a mess.

The dispensing mechanism should be designed to prevent drips and spills, ensuring a clean and hassle-free serving experience. Look for models with sturdy spouts and easy-to-operate levers or push-button dispensers. Some advanced models incorporate insulated dispensers that maintain the coffee's temperature while preventing burns.

Key features of the leading 30 cup coffee makers in 2025 include:

*   Rapid brewing capabilities
*   Effective keep warm functionality
*   Clear water level indicators
*   Durable, high-quality construction
*   User-friendly, easy-to-clean design
*   Reliable dispensing mechanisms

 ## Core Benefits

A high-quality 30 cup coffee maker offers several significant benefits, making it an excellent investment for various settings.

**Efficient Batch Brewing:** The primary benefit is the ability to brew a large batch of coffee quickly and efficiently. This saves time and effort compared to brewing multiple smaller batches, making it ideal for serving large groups.

The efficient batch brewing capabilities of a 30 cup coffee maker are especially beneficial in settings like offices, churches, and catering events. The ability to produce a substantial amount of coffee in a single brewing cycle ensures that everyone gets their caffeine fix without long waits or constant refills.

**Cost Savings:** Brewing coffee in large batches can be more cost-effective than using individual coffee pods or purchasing coffee from a cafËåÖ.

Over time, the cost savings can be substantial, particularly in high-consumption environments. By using bulk coffee grounds and brewing large batches, you can significantly reduce your coffee expenses. This makes a 30 cup coffee maker a wise investment for organizations looking to optimize their budgets.

**Consistent Coffee Quality:** Many high-quality 30 cup coffee makers are designed to maintain consistent coffee quality throughout the entire brewing process.

Features like precise temperature control and even water distribution ensure that each cup of coffee is brewed to perfection. This consistency is especially important when serving a large group, as it ensures that everyone enjoys a satisfying and flavorful cup of coffee.

**Convenience and Ease of Use:** Modern 30 cup coffee makers are designed with user convenience in mind, featuring intuitive controls and easy-to-clean components.

This makes them simple to operate and maintain, even for users who are not experienced coffee connoisseurs. Features like programmable timers and automatic shut-off functions further enhance the convenience, allowing you to set the coffee maker to brew automatically and prevent it from overheating.

**Versatility:** Many 30 cup coffee makers can also be used to brew smaller batches of coffee, making them versatile enough for both small and large gatherings.

This versatility ensures that you can always brew the perfect amount of coffee, regardless of the number of people you are serving. Some models also offer additional features like hot water dispensing, making them even more versatile and convenient.

**What Type of Coffee Grounds Should I Use?**

Medium-ground coffee is generally recommended for most 30 cup coffee makers. Using the correct grind size ensures optimal extraction and prevents clogging. Avoid using excessively fine or coarse grounds, as they can negatively impact the flavor and brewing process.
