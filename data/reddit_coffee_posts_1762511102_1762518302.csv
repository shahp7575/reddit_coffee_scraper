I am male 32. 180cm tall. 
Using bike almost daily for 30 mins
Doing 2 hours of sport every two weeks as well.
Diagnosed with anxiety.
Using: 7.5mg Escitalopram 14 months 
- NAC 800mg 2 months 
- L theanine 3 weeks 500 mg
Using Escitalopram and NAC in the evening and L theanine in the morning together with green tea.

After I added L theanine to my supplementation my mental health improved alot and I felt like my life got alot better. My anxiety is almost non existent.
However after few very busy days I started to have severe fatigue during the day. I tried to combat it with coffee which I usually don't drink but without noticable effects.
What could be causing the daytime fatigue in my case. Has anyone had similar problem?
I wake up very sleepy as well and i sleep for like 8 hours a day and I get up at night to pee and fall asleep again.

Most decor is stuff I’ve managed to find along the years, so yard sales, thrift stores, discounts department stores. The furniture is from Amazon (coffee cart, desk), chair is from Walmart. Wooden chest is a family heirloom. 

The headboard was from IKEA but was already attached to the wall when we purchased the house, so we worked with what we had. 

The cart houses a coffee maker, microwave and mini fridge, fully stocked with essential items. 

The guests have a full bathroom just around the corner of the hallway so there is access to a shower/tub.

I need advice on what to do with them.
Home Roasting: What is the best, most reliable way to roast a kilo of green beans at home using common kitchen equipment (like a skillet/wok or an oven)? Any Mumbai-specific tips for ventilation or cooling are welcome!
Professional Help: Does anyone know of a service or individual who would take on this small, personal batch for custom roasting?

Need Genuine Advice.","So, this is something I've been keeping to myself for way too long and just needed to get it out, hoping some of y’all can give me some perspective.

There’s this girl on campus I’ve had a crush on for almost a year . Honestly, I’m not even sure if she knows I exist. The first time I even heard her name was in a conversation in my friend circle, and out of curiosity, I checked her profile—found her genuinely attractive, sure, but there was just something different about her.

Here’s the catch: We have no mutual friends, no mutual groups, literally zero points of contact on campus. In all this time, we’ve never spoken—not even a hi. There have been plenty of days when I’ve thought about just shooting my shot, DMing her and maybe asking her out for coffee. But honestly, I always stop myself, because I don’t want to come across as some rando appearing out of nowhere—a total stranger in her DMs. I have no idea how she would react, and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable.

What makes this special (and honestly confusing for me) is that it’s never been like this before. I’ve felt attraction towards people before, but those feelings always faded with time, distractions, or as I got to know them a bit more. With her, though, I can’t explain it—it’s only gotten stronger with time, almost obsessive lately (not in a creepy way, just that she’s on my mind a lot).

It’s not like I feel desperate to be in a relationship just for the sake of it—actually, I’ve never had trouble meeting people or even getting into relationships. But with her, it feels like I want something more real—someone who shares the same high values, someone who’d actually want to stick around.

Some days I genuinely consider just sending her a DM and inviting her for coffee… then I back out every time because I really don’t want to be “that guy” sliding into her DMs, just like everyone else.

Am I massively overthinking this, or has anyone else dealt with something similar? What would be a non-creepy, respectful way to maybe, possibly, get to know her? Open to any advice or perspective, cause it’s honestly getting complicated and my brain’s going in circles at this point.

Thanks if you read this far—needed to vent somewhere.

1oqsp6v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqsp6v,I Spent Months Making a Business Sim Game With 14 Rivals You Have To Compete With,"Hi  👋

I spent the last 6 months building a business simulator game on iOS, mainly because I felt like there was nothing like it for mobile. And It's FREE to play right Now!

I took a lot of inspiration from Big Ambitions, so if you ever played that game on Steam, this might feel familiar. 

This game is not a clicker or a game where you have to wait X real world hours for something to happen.

You find commercial buildings with high stats to rent, choose which business you want to open, hire staff, keep up with inventory, upgrade your building, and keep satisfaction high so customers actually buy. 

The BIGGEST obstacle is rivals. You actively compete with 14 of them. Customers like a good deal, but going cheap might mean you can't afford to pay your bills, so you have to find a balance. 

Titan Rivals will start price wars if you mess with them, so make sure you have enough capital to sustain losses. 

You can rent HQ Offices & Warehouse to hire HQ Managers who deal with customer/staff incidents, and purchase managers to automate stock for you. Warehouses to keep inventory in check, and a delivery driver to do deliveries between warehouses and businesses. Because if you ain't got stuff to sell, you ain't getting paid!

On our days off he walks around in his slippers drinking this rifle coffee from this pistol cup and it gets on my nerves so bad. So I have 3 boxes of this rifle coffee and it tastes basically like my Folgers (after he gets done seasoning it). 
We have a super healthy marriage, we never fight and we are able to communicate differences well over any arguments. We’re both goofy and generally happy people. 
But this coffee cup 😂😂

1oqsoru,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1oqsoru/emotional_affair/,Emotional affair?,"Looking for advice. 

My husband and I have been together since we were 17. We’ve been married for 7 years and are expecting our first child next month. Before this I have never had any reason not to trust him and I consider him my very best friend and can’t imagine my life without him.

Backstory: A couple of years ago my husband joined an adult sports rec league and has made a new group of friends. I have hung out with everyone from this group on multiple occasions. They will usually play the game and then go to a local dive bar for beers as a group. Some of them have become close and will hangout outside of the sport. We’ve gone on bar crawls together and group “friendsgivings” There is one female friend that my husband has gotten particularly close to recently. In the course of being on the team, she has gone through a divorce, rebound relationship, and now single again. She sort of acts like “one of the guys” and seems to be closer with the guys than the girls on the team. I’ve never had a reason to think poorly of her, and I like her as a person.

2 Recent events:
1- My husband was invited to party where this female friend was his ride to/from the party (he drove to her house but they carpooled to the party) but they were meeting up with others so I felt comfortable with the situation. He told me he wouldn’t stay at the party past 11pm because he had to be up early the next morning. I woke up at 1:40am and realized he wasn’t home. I checked his location and it showed he was at the female friends house. I texted him asking if he was okay (thought maybe he had too much to drink) and he didn’t answer my text. I then called him 3 times with no answer. Then I texted the female friend and asked if my husband was okay and if he needed a ride. That’s when my husband proceeds to call me saying his phone was on the coffee table and he didn’t hear it. And said that they had been up watching the end of a baseball game and he’s heading home now. The friend told me he had too much to drink so she made him sit inside with water before driving home.  
When he got home I was visibly shaking and asked if anything happened between the 2 of them. He denied it and then ran through the whole series of events that night. It turns out they left the party just the 2 of them and went to a bar to catch some of this game before ultimately going back to her place where she deemed him too drunk to drive. I feel like he shouldn’t have been in a situation where they were alone with alcohol involved and had the opportunity for lined to be crossed but ultimately I believed that nothing happened.

Situation 2:
4 days after that, I got a credit card alert saying that the password to our shared account had been changed. I went on with Face ID and saw there were 2 charges from the day before for a local distillery and a restaurant. My husband claimed that he had to help at a work function that would run until about 10pm. He left the house around 5pm and asked if I’d be okay to fend for myself for dinner because he wasn’t hungry and would likely eat pizza provided at this function. Ive been suffering with some depression/anxiety lately (due to pregnancy hormones) especially as the sun goes down and had been crying before he left saying I didn’t want him to go. Anyway after I saw these charges I asked if they were him and he said no. Then he played along with the fact it could have been a credit card fraud and he even went and cancelled the credit cards. He even said that he’s not sure how the password got changed. I had a sinking feeling so I did some digging and found that his phone was the one who accessed the account the night before at 11:32 (likely realizing I could see the charges) and then again in the morning where he changed the password so I wouldn’t be able to log in myself to see the charges. 
I sat him down and asked him again what he was doing last night. I told him I know that those charges for the bar/restaurant were from him. He denied it and insisted the card could’ve been compromised. I then showed him screenshots of the device login showing clear as day that he logged in to the cc account and that’s when he changed the password. He vehemently denied that it wasn’t him logging on. I wouldn’t back down and begged him to tell the truth because the next step would be me driving to the restaurant and asking to see a copy of the bill receipt that would be even more physical proof. He stared at me for a long time and just said that I won’t believe what he has to say next because it already looks so bad. He told me that he was so worried that I would think he was cheating because of the events that happened after the party the other night, that he was trying to protect me by lying to me saying he had a work function when really this female friend asked him to hang out and grab a drink. He said they then got dinner (mind you a $83 tab that he covered completely—all while I’m at home eating freezer chicken nuggets) he came clean about the whole thing and when I asked how his phone was pinging at his work at 10pm, he admitted that he parked his car and left his phone in the car and had his female friend pick him up. He admitted that he made up the lie about the work function and said he got in too deep with the story that he didn’t know how to get out of it without hurting me so he just continued on and tried to cover his tracks. He adamantly denies anything actually happened between them 

I feel devastated and betrayed. I’m not sure how to trust him after he lied to my face so many times and came up with that elaborate story to sneak around behind my back. I don’t think anything physical is going on between them but I fear that this kind of secrecy is a gateway to further interactions between them that now he will work harder to cover. I’m so scared and don’t know what to do. We have a baby coming next month and I don’t want to throw our lives away, but I just don’t know how to get past this and ever trust him again. To me he is putting that friendship as a top priority above his marriage and I hate the way that makes me feel. It feels like an actual gut punch. Why go through so many lengths to hide a hang out if there is nothing more going on?

But as you stand back and admire your work, a single thought creeps in: ""I hope they don't spill anything on the rug.""

We've all been there. A beautiful rug can tie a guest room together, but it also becomes a magnet for anxiety. Spilled coffee, tracked-in mud, pet hair from a furry travel companion... the list of potential disasters is endless.

But what if you could have style *and* peace of mind? What if you could offer your guests a warm, welcoming space without worrying about every little mishap?

Enter the **guest room washable rug**. This isn't just a trend; it's a hospitality revolution for your home. Let's dive into why this single item is the ultimate upgrade for your guest space.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

## Why a Washable Rug is a Game-Changer for Guest Rooms

A rug in a guest room serves many purposes—it adds warmth, muffles sound, and defines the space. But a *washable* rug does all that and so much more. It transforms your hosting experience from one of constant worry to one of relaxed, genuine hospitality.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

### 1. Effortless Cleanup for Total Peace of Mind

This is the number one reason, and it’s a big one. Guests can be hesitant and self-conscious about making a mess. A washable rug sends a clear, unspoken message: **""Relax. This is a home, not a hotel. Accidents happen.""**

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

*   **Spills?** Coffee, wine, or a knocked-over water glass are no longer catastrophes. Just toss the rug in the wash.
*   **Mud & Dirt?** A guest coming in from a rainy day won't leave a permanent reminder of their visit.
*   **Pet Accidents?** If your guests bring a furry friend, you can handle any surprise ""presents"" with ease and odor-free cleaning.

### 2. A Truly Fresh Start for Every Single Guest

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

Think about the best hotel you've ever stayed in. One of the hallmarks of luxury is that feeling of absolute freshness. With a **guest room washable rug**, you can achieve that same standard.

Between guests, simply wash the rug. You’re not just removing visible stains; you’re eliminating dust, dander, pollen, and any lingering allergens from the previous visitor. It’s the ultimate reset button for the room, ensuring every guest feels like they are the first to stay.

### 3. It’s a Boon for Allergy Sufferers

Speaking of allergens, traditional rugs are notorious for trapping dust, pet dander, and other irritants. This can be a nightmare for guests with allergies or asthma. A washable rug actively removes these triggers. By washing it regularly (even just seasonally), you create a healthier, more comfortable environment for everyone who stays under your roof.

### 4. Style Meets Practicality (Finally!)

Gone are the days when ""washable"" meant a boring, thin, utilitarian mat. Today's washable rugs are stunning. They come in a huge variety of:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

*   **Patterns:** Classic geometric, modern abstract, traditional Persian-inspired.
*   **Textures:** Plush and cozy chenille, flat-woven cotton, soft synthetic blends.
*   **Colors:** Every shade imaginable, from calming neutrals to vibrant jewel tones.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

#### Consider the Material

*   **Cotton:** Often flat-woven, lightweight, and easy to machine wash and dry. Great for a casual, laid-back vibe.
*   **Chenille:** Incredibly soft and plush underfoot. Feels luxurious but is still designed for washing. Might take longer to dry.
*   **Polyester/Polypropylene Blends:** Extremely durable, stain-resistant, and often the most affordable. They mimic the look of wool or other natural fibers.

#### Get the Size Right

A tiny rug floating in the middle of the room looks awkward. A rug that’s too big can overwhelm the space. Here are a few common layouts:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

*   **In Front of the Bed:** A standard 2’x3’ or 3’x5’ rug at the foot of the bed adds a soft spot for feet to land.
*   **Along the Side of the Bed:** A **washable runner rug** (2’5” x 7’ or similar) works beautifully along one or both sides of the bed.
*   **Most of the Room:** For a larger guest room, aim for a rug that can fit under at least the front two-thirds of the bed, grounding the entire furniture arrangement.

> **Pro-Tip:** Always measure your room and bed frame before you buy! Use painter's tape on the floor to outline the rug's dimensions and see how it fits.

#### Read the ""Washable"" Fine Print

This is crucial. Not all ""washable"" rugs are created equal. Before you click ""buy,"" check the product details:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

*   **Machine Size:** Does it require a standard home washing machine, or do you need access to a commercial-sized machine? Most are designed for home machines.
*   **Washing Instructions:** What water temperature and cycle setting should you use? Cold water on a gentle cycle is typical.
*   **Drying Instructions:** Can it go in the dryer (on low heat!), or does it need to air dry? Air drying is most common and helps prevent shrinkage.

## Final Thoughts: It’s an Investment in Hospitality

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=guest%20room%20washable%20rug)

A **guest room washable rug** is more than just a piece of decor. It’s a tool that helps you be a better, more relaxed host. It frees you from worry, provides a fresher and healthier space for your guests, and does it all without sacrificing an ounce of style.

1oqsoq4,https://i.redd.it/1wdjh3mxstzf1.jpeg,"Prayer Series: “It’s Not Always Rainbows and Unicorns. "" Unmasking the Subtle Sins We Often Excuse - Day 4","Day 4: Lying by Omission - The Quiet Betrayal

Scripture
“Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to your neighbor, for we are all members of one body.”
— Ephesians 4:25 (NIV)

Last month I watched a marriage nearly collapse over a single unsent text. Sarah discovered her husband Mark had been meeting an old girlfriend for coffee—“just catching up,” he insisted. He never mentioned it because “it wasn’t a big deal.”

But every time Sarah asked, “How was your day?” and he answered, “Fine,” he carved another inch of distance between them. The truth wasn’t in what he said. It was in what he deliberately left unsaid.

Reflection: 
The Weight of Silence Half-truths are still lies wearing camouflage. We omit details to protect ourselves, to avoid conflict, to keep the peace, to look better, to stay safe. But every omission is a brick in a wall we build between us and the people we love. Eventually someone has to live on the other side of that wall.

Scripture doesn’t mince words: “Put off falsehood.” Not just bold-faced lies. Not just exaggeration. Anything that misleads—anything that leaves the other person with a distorted picture of reality—is falsehood. Silence can be holy (think Jesus before Herod). Silence can also be sinful (think Pilate washing his hands). A Hard Look in the Mirror

Ask yourself these four questions today:
1.  What relationship feels “off” right now?
2.  Is there a truth I’ve been avoiding because it’s awkward, painful, or inconvenient?
3.  Have I been letting someone believe something that isn’t fully true?
4.  If the roles were reversed, would I want to be told?

Prayer
Father,
You are the God who sees everything—nothing is hidden from You. Yet You speak the truth in love, never to shame, always to heal. Expose the places where I’ve chosen silence over courage. Give me the exact words, the right timing, and the gentle spirit needed to speak what I’ve been withholding. Replace my fear of man with fear of You. Let my “yes” be yes, my “no” be no, and my silence be only when You give me permission to be still. In the name of Jesus, the Way, the Truth, and the Life.
Amen.

Action Steps
1.  Write the unsent text. Draft the message you’ve been avoiding. Don’t send it yet—just get the truth on paper.
2.  Pray over it for 24 hours. Ask God to season your words with grace and to prepare the other person’s heart.
3.  Speak it in person if possible. Text can hide tone; face-to-face forces humility.
4.  Start small. Use this script if you need it:
""There’s something I’ve been leaving out when we talk about ______, and I don’t want to keep doing that. Can I share the full story?”

Closing Promise
“The Lord detests lying lips, but He delights in people who are trustworthy.”

— Proverbs 12:22
Today, choose to be someone He delights in—even when it costs you.

The truth you’re afraid to speak might be the exact key that sets both of you free. ",1,1762517333.0,BibleVerseCommentary,0,1.0,False

While metrics point to steady growth and a cooling labor market, public sentiment has soured: the price of a cup of coffee is up 20% compared with 2024 and burgers are 15% more expensive.  



Voters are reassessing long-held assumptions: historically, Republicans have led on economic issues, yet recent polls show voters who deem the economy “not so good” overwhelmingly backing Democrats.  Meanwhile, sharp tariff measures, the ongoing 38-day government shutdown, and lavish White House spending—even as food-aid programs lag—have fed public frustration.  



The White House insists that fiscal and monetary actions will show benefits in early 2026, but advisers concede that without a visible sense of rising living standards, a growing economy may still count as a political liability.

Back a few months ago the most precious, the most beautiful, and the most amazing woman i have yet met broke up with me. I'm in my early twenties, so is her, it was my first ever relstionship. It was amazing, you see, im kind of introverted, while i have many many friends i don't usually share everything about my life with them, i only do so if my emotions and feelings overwhelm me and need advice on how to manage them... But with her? It was the first tine ever i was capable of talking with someone of anything and everything that there ever was in a short span of time, i guess she knew me better than my friends ever will, she step deep into me and saw the true person that i am... We were so deep in love for each other, or so i guessed...every time i talked with her and learned something about herself I went to my best friend and i was like ""Man she's amazing she likes these things that i also love and man it's all wonderful"" and he was like ""Oh yeah?"" Like a proud father listening her son talk about girl he met at school.

The relationship lasted for about three months. The last month let's say it was difficult for her she got really sick... And once she had an anxiety attack to which i calmed her down staying by her side, i tried visiting her every time i got freed from college duties... Still wasn't easy for her, i knew it, so as soon as she got better i asked her if she would like to have breakfast with me at a nice coffee shop in the city, i remember that cold day of winter wearing something nice and going to see her, i even stopped at flower shop in order to buy her a nice bouquet of flowers. I payed for everything i was just happy that she finally was doibg better with her health and wanted to make her happy... But that was just three days before she broke up with me...

You see i didn't even notice anything wrong about her, not even in her messages not even the day we went to the coffee shop, nothing. Suddenly in the afternoon i get a message ""Can you meet at ""x"" place at three o'clock?"" and then my heart sank... I thought of every possibility... And the worst one the break up....

I went there and the exchange was the following:
Her: Hi
Me: Hi, what happened?
Her: I'm ... I'm sorry for what i about to say, but i can't continue the relationship (With her nose getting all wattery and her eyes starting to cry, and her voice and hans shaking)
Me: May i know why?
Her: It's just that i can be as loving with you as i used to be with my past partner, I can't say ""I love you"" as easy as you make it sound... I can't... and i believe it's something that requires professional help... (She had previously been in a toxic relationship of four years, needless to say she was barely a year into being single, but didn't process that breakup, something that i learned better as i processed the whole relationship i had with her and the breakup)
Me: Has something happened to you?
Her: No it's just that people who love you font knwo when they hurt you (i thought she was referring to me initially, but after thinking about it was about her parents, her mother especially didn't want her to go so soon to the coffee shop after getting healthy again)
Me: But i can't wait... There's so much time I...
Her: (with her voice breaking) No i don't want you to wait
Her: I'm sorry (still crying)
Me: (started hugging her) Don't worry about it.
Her: (As i hugged her) I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt you...
Me: (Still hugging her) Don't worry, it's okay...
Her: (With her voice breaking again) No it's not okay...
Me: I'm sorry it's just... (and i started crying here) I once dreamed i was marrying you and every day you maked me happy i couldn't help myself but say  how much of a jerk was your ex for treating you the way he did, and leaving such a wonderful person.
Her: You'll find someone else, you deserve better...
Me: But I only wanted to just love you, and you only...
Her: You're everything a woman wants in a man...
Me: Did you just come here to do this or sre you planning to do something after this?
Her: I don't know (while cleaning her tear from hear face)
Me: Why don't you visit ""Y"" (her best female friend, more than friend id say, the sister she never had) tell her to hang out or something, you'll need it...
Her: I guess i will...

After that we hugged once and i decided that it was time to let go... I was devastated that day, my best friends took side and man they hated her... I didn't, it was the only way things could end and she took the most human and compassionate approach... I knew from the very moment i left the place we met that things couldn't go back to the way they used to be... For three days i cried, i was in a city far from home, alone crying, the entirety from my group was out of the city... For thos three i didn't care for my life, but didn't want to hurt anyone else so i kept pushing and maked my self go out for walks to clear my head... After a week i started processing things and reflectioning about what happened that day and the entirety of the relationship... After two weeks i propossed to myself to reach out to her best friend by a month of having breaking up, not in order to go back to what we used to, but to know how she was doing and ask her friend how she was doing... I did, she welcomed me, and treated me nice, she didnt want to be in the middle of my ex and me, and i respected her choice, i just her knew i wanted her to take care of my ex during her recovery, and said nice things about her and she (her friend) after what she said to me (both ""X"" -my ex- and I think you're a great person)... I decided to reach to my ex before college resume, especially because we shared classes together, and i promised her friend things wouldn't be tense between her friend group and mine... I did, i also wanted to give her my part of the break up, because i was so devastated that day that i couldn't say anything to her... I just wanted to tell her that i was sorry if i ever hurt her unknowingly, wether it was with my actions or something i said...I wanted to forgive her and forgive myself and wanted for both us to keep threatening us as friends... i send her a message she answered, but didnt think it was a great idea, i respected her choice, and let her knew before saying goodbye that i still kept thinking of her as the greatest person i ever met... After that we didn't spoke, she never talk to me, and i can see sometines that she could stare me at the eyes, i don't know if she carries guilt with her... 

The reason why i write this is that while it make seem that i did things right and threated everythinng with maturity (or so my friends think) there's always a voice in the back of my head that says ""Things ended because of YOU, it was all YOUR fault, YOU hurt her and she broke with you because of that"" i keep telling myself that had i hurt her she wouldn't have complemented me during the break, wouldn't have been sorry, etc... But sometimes i believe that what makes me doubt is the distance that she has put between me and hehrself... She didnt unfollow me or any of my friends online, so didnt i with her and her friends, and we treated allways each other with respect everytime with crossed... So now i'll be reading you people what do you guys think?

Im almost 40
And in my life ive put my body through a hell of a lot, always having the walk it off mentality when it comes to injuries. 

No broken bones, but several sprains and more bruises and cuts then I care to count. 

I've always been the kinda guy who could get hurt, wait 20 min then get back to work. 

 Now let's rewind to two a years, I've always had ""bathroom issues"" eat the wrong thing and up in the bathroom with bad shits occasionally have really bad constipation I figured its part of life. 

I started having issues with vasovagal syncope,  (passed out at a wedding when I wasn't drinking, but was working at a photographer) figured it was dehydration but my wife made me go-to the doctor. 

Since then I've started having back and stomach pain as well as regilar fatigue and insomnia.  

Back in may I was diagnosed with Crohn's with underlining IBS. 

With that ive been off work since then due to the aforementioned fatigue and pain. It's not something I'm used to as I can't just walk it off. 

If I try and do a full day of work, even just being out of the house a full day. I find myself exhausted the following day. 

Is this normal? I feel like I should be able to power through it but my body won't let me. 

Maybe it's just in my head? Honestly I don't know but it's weighing heavily on my mind.

Any one else struggle with the same issues?

# From the Skies to the Hills

Around Lake Travis, a few neighbors carry stories that stretch far beyond these hills - like Col. Jack Crownover, a retired U.S. Air Force pilot and Vietnam veteran. After flying combat missions overseas, he came home to build community here in Lake Travis, helping fellow veterans reconnect through Honor Flight Austin and keeping their stories alive for the next generation.

In a place better known for its sunsets than its uniforms, neighbors like him remind us that service isn't something left behind, it's something carried forward.

This is the large breakfast that also comes with black pudding and ‘shrooms, which I didn’t have because I don’t like them (que gasps from appalled Redditors ☺️). There are two bits of fried bread under the eggs, which were lovely and runny.

Probably the best cooked breakfast I’ve had. Well priced at £11.90 (the coffee was extra), considering the amount and quality of the ingredients.

Could it be improved? Probably needed more beans and in a pot (more gasps of horror) as they made the bread soggy.

1oqsfil,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1oqsfil/m4a_seeking_one_1_coauthor_for_drama_emotional/,[M4A] Seeking One (1) Co-Author for Drama & Emotional Damage,"Hello there! I’m Dan, 27 years young from the UK. Straight off the bat, I *did* produce an ad before but accidentally deleted it - so here's take two. I’ve decided to return to RP after a long stint away. It was a huge creative outlet for me through my teens (around eight years of roleplay back then!), and now I’m eager to dive back in with some new stories and meet new people. My wife is always reminding me how much I enjoy(ed) writing and should get back into it - and wise husbands listen to their wives! 

A bit about me: I work in marketing and videography, and I studied Writing for Performance (Scriptwriting) for my Master’s; writing has been part of both my professional and personal life for a while. I’ve produced short films, written short stories and scripts, though that was a good few years ago now, so no editorial red pen just yet pls. I’m happily fumbling my way back into the scene, so forgive me if I get some of the lingo and etiquette slightly wrong!

I spent some time in the military, which gave me a lot of character insight, travel opportunities, and a deep respect for coffee strong enough to resurrect the dead. I’ve travelled widely, sometimes for work (documentaries or humanitarian projects), sometimes just to see what the world was doing. As a result, I’ve met an eclectic bunch of people, all of which inevitably end up becoming character fuel.

Outside of work, my hobbies and passions vary wildly: I have a soft spot for films, animals, people, history, culture, comedy, music and the outdoors, though I’m equally happy staying in with a good book, a deep conversation, a glass of something stronger than orange juice, or a board game (I say I’m a good loser but everyone who says that is a liar). I've tested my hand (and feet) in various sports, sometimes at a high level, other times barely well enough to call it competing. I’m also a comfortable level of nerd; the kind who can quote Lord of the Rings and Shrek with zero shame and zero hesitation. 

In terms of writing, I’d say I sit comfortably at advanced / novella-style prose - descriptive, character-driven, emotionally grounded. The best stories, in my opinion, are those with the best characters; real, flawed, layered (ogres have layers) and authentic. I've a penchant for original characters (OCs I believe they’re called), and worlds that are built through atmosphere and detail, not just exposition. I tend to gravitate toward slow-burn dynamics, meaningful tension, and relationships that evolve over time rather than explode on impact.

I enjoy a wide range of settings, including historical, fantasy, period drama, low-stakes slice-of-life stories with depth, dusty post-apocalyptic road stories, medieval courts full of secrets, cowboys with emotional repression problems, and aristocrats with too much time and not enough sense. I’m flexible and curious. There's no particular fandom I’m chasing right now, though I’m absolutely open to stepping into a partner’s favourite setting if it’s one you love. I genuinely enjoy the challenge of inhabiting a world that means something to someone else.

I also love the creative process behind the scenes - tossing ideas back and forth, exploring themes, building worlds and dynamics together, jotting down notes when I should be focussing at work. The collaboration is half the joy of it for me.

It goes without saying (but I guess it doesn’t because I’m literally saying it) – I’m looking for partners 18+ only. Largely because I enjoy exploring emotional nuance, complexity, and occasionally the darker and/or spicier corners of life, and that tends to work best with people who’ve lived a little life too. I will be upfront, I have several commitments during the week (church, work, remembering to drink etc). So if you’re someone who tends to riff off constant daily engagement, I might not be the best fit for you. Though of course, I will endeavour to make time for a friend! 

I've already connected with a few people (if you're reading this guys, don't shoot, we’re all good), so I'm not looking to expand my circle massively. Ideally, someone in the same timezone would be great, but don't let that be a barrier to reaching out. If any of this sounds like your cup of tea, send me a message; even just with the kind of stories you like or the vibes you tend to write. We don’t need to have a plot instantly, happy to find it together. And I wish I could say I only speak/type this much when I’m behind a keyboard, but that’d be a lie. Yappers unite! \*Insert Ron Burgundy blowing the horn\*

As I am, in fact, writing this at work, I’ll sign off in classic office email fashion:

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Title has an extra ""named"" in it, you are not crazy, I am!""**

So at work I work with a man named Joe.  He does tons of funny / shake your head moments throughout the day and me and a co-worker randomly talk about all of his daily events whether they are accomplishments or wtf moments.  We had the idea of doing a sitcom type log of all of these events and one day I decided to just start writing about them.  ""Most"" of the episodes are based on true stories, though a few are just ideas I have had about things he could do...  I'm not sure if this will be funny or entertaining to random people who do not know anything about this man but I figured I'd post an episode or 2 online and see if others thought it was funny.

You have to read it like a sitcom and kind of understand that I am only writing key events that would be taking place in the sitcom, very little fluff which would normally kill time within an episode.  I started very small in length but I've progressively increased the size of each episode as I've gotten more confident.

I break each event into acts similar to how a TV show would work as well...  Also I am copy pasting from my google drive document so I have to format all of this in reddit on the fly.. no clue it it formats properly.

Okay… progress?

***Cue theme song.***

**ACT ONE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – LATER**

Joe calls Tech Support. After a robotic menu nightmare, he finally reaches RAVI, a calm but weary technician from a call center.

**RAVI**

Thank you for calling HP Support. My name is Ravi, how may I assist you today?

**JOE**

Hi Ravi. My printer… it’s alive. I think it’s trying to fax my toaster.

*Ravi sighs quietly.*

**RAVI**

Sir, may I have the model number?

**JOE**

Sure thing. Uh… it’s “X” … and then a smudge of coffee… and then maybe a “Q”?

**RAVI**

Sir, could you read the label on the back?

**JOE**

I’d love to, but the printer’s on fire a little bit.

**RAVI**

*(on autopilot)*

Please unplug the device, sir.

*Joe unplugs his lamp.*

**JOE**

Done!

*The printer beeps louder.*

**ACT TWO**

**INT. JOE’S APARTMENT – CONTINUOUS**

*Ravi walks Joe through resetting the printer. Each step only makes things worse. The printer begins printing gibberish symbols and emojis.*

**RAVI**

Sir, that’s not supposed to happen.

**JOE**

Is it printing hieroglyphics? Should I call a museum?

**RAVI**

No, sir, please do not call a museum.

As Joe follows directions, the printer somehow connects to his microwave, which now says “READY TO PRINT.”

**JOE**

Oh great, now my lasagna’s getting updates.

**ACT THREE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – EVENING**

After two hours, Ravi and Joe have bonded through shared suffering.

**RAVI**

You remind me of my uncle. He once tried to print a PDF by holding it up to the scanner.

**JOE**

Your uncle sounds like a genius.

*Finally, Ravi suggests reinstalling the driver.*

**JOE**

Reinstall it? Ravi, I think the driver’s already left the vehicle.

*Joe accidentally presses the “self-cleaning” mode. Ink sprays everywhere.*

**RAVI**

Sir, please tell me you didn’t—

**JOE**

Oh, I did.

**TAG SCENE**

**INT. JOE’S LIVING ROOM – NIGHT**

*Joe, covered in ink, finally manages to print one page. He holds it up triumphantly.*

**JOE**

It worked! Ravi, it worked!

**RAVI**

That’s wonderful, sir! What does it say?

**JOE**

(reads)

“Printer Error: Contact Support.”

*Joe stares at it. The printer powers down dramatically.*

**JOE**

Ravi… you still there?

**RAVI**

This is it, Lucy — sun, sand, and absolutely no problems.

*The mood is high — until smoke starts rising from the hood.*

That’s probably just… enthusiasm.

*The car sputters, then dies completely. Joe pulls over near a sign reading “You’re 73 miles from Paradise*

*Beach!”*

**LUCY**

Guess paradise is cancelled.

*They end up waiting three hours for a tow truck while Joe tries to remain upbeat.*

**JOE**

You know, this is fine. We’ll get a rental, and we’ll still make it before dinner.

**LUCY**

If dinner is tomorrow.

**ACT TWO**

**EXT. BEACH RESORT – EVENING**

*They finally arrive — exhausted — at the resort. The weather is gloomy, and the TV in the lobby warns*

*of a hurricane watch.*

**JOE**

Oh, come on, how bad can it be? They say “watch” all the time. It’s like a movie trailer — doesn’t mean

it’s real.

**RESORT MANAGER**

Sir, you should probably evacuate by morning.

**JOE**

…Great. We’ll get to experience local culture.

*Cut to Joe struggling to nail plywood over their hotel window with a butter knife.*

**ACT THREE**

**EXT. PARKING LOT – NEXT MORNING**

*As they prepare to evacuate, Lucy trips while helping Joe load the car and falls awkwardly.*

**LUCY**

*(crying)*

Dad, I think I broke my arm!

*Joe rushes her to a crowded urgent care, where everything that can go wrong does — power flickers,*

*paperwork vanishes, and Joe’s credit card gets declined.*

**JOE**

Can I just pay you in… pure panic?

*When they finally leave the clinic, the hurricane warning has turned into a full evacuation order. Joe*

*tries to start the car — and of course, it won’t start.*

**JOE**

*(to the sky)*

Is this because I didn’t buy the extended warranty?!

*Rain pours down.*

**LUCY**

Dad… I still love you.

**JOE**

Thanks, sweetheart. Just tell me that again when the rescue boat comes.

**TAG SCENE**

**INT. MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT**

*Joe and Lucy sit wrapped in towels, eating vending machine snacks in a rundown inland motel. The*

*storm rages outside, but they’re safe.*

**LUCY**

You know, Dad… this is kind of nice.

**JOE**

Yeah. Nothing like quality time — with expired peanut butter cups.

*They share a laugh as the power flickers out.*

**JOE** *(in darkness)*

At least it can’t get any worse.

*A loud crash outside.*

**LUCY**

What was that?

**JOE**

*Probably just our luggage… heading to paradise without us.*

1oqscc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/VideoGuide/comments/1oqscc9/how_to_change_video_background_without_going_full/,How to change video background without going full VFX wizard?,"Alright, editors – I need to vent, share, and maybe learn something in the process.

So I’ve recently gotten into video editing. Not professionally or anything... just the “make-my-TikToks-not-look-like-they-were-shot-in-a-bathroom” level of skill. And the thing that’s been haunting me lately is this: how to change video background without turning my room into a green screen studio or applying for a job at ILM.

Here’s the deal. I shoot a lot of quick content – product demos, reaction takes, tutorial-style stuff. My actual backdrop? A tragic combo of beige wall, laundry pile, and a suspicious shadow that may or may not be mold. Naturally, I wanted to change that. Put myself in a “cool” virtual set. You know, like every YouTuber with a neon sign and fake bookshelf.

What I didn’t want was to spend five hours masking my outline frame by frame while my laptop screamed for help.

# Attempt #1: The Green Screen I Don’t Own

So like every eager beginner, I Googled. Forums like VideoHelp and the r/VideoEditing thread from earlier this year all said the same thing: “Get a green screen.”

Right. Let me just find a perfectly lit, wrinkle-free, evenly saturated green sheet that doesn’t make me look like Shrek under fluorescent light.

Spoiler: didn’t happen.

Tried using an old bedsheet. Bad idea. It was mint green. I looked like I was fading into the Matrix. Lighting was uneven, shadows everywhere. OBS chroma key did its best, but honestly, it looked like I was reporting live from a weather map of sadness.

Even when I sort of got the green screen working, the results were... not flattering. Apparently, the blur tool can't fix wrinkles (mine or the sheet's), and my background flickered like a ghost was trying to exit the frame.

# Attempt #2: Masking Like a Madman

Next up, I thought: hey, maybe I can just mask myself out manually. I used Premiere Pro’s masking tools for about 30 seconds before I realized I don’t have the patience of a forensic animator.

Also – feathering is a liar. It either leaves a glowing edge or erases half my head. No in-between.

Tried motion tracking. Watched six tutorials. Gave up halfway through tutorial seven when the creator said, “Now export the alpha pass.” Sir, I don’t know what an alpha pass is. I just want to remove my messy bedroom.

# Attempt #3: Let’s Try the AI Route

At this point, I discovered there are actual tools out there with background removal built-in. Like, no green screen needed. What kind of sorcery is this?

I tested a few.

CapCut has an auto cutout tool – worked surprisingly well for a mobile app, but only for short clips.

Runway ML came highly recommended in a few creator groups, and it’s cool for one-off projects, but the free plan’s limited and rendering takes ages. Like ""make-coffee-and-do-dishes"" ages.

And then there’s Movavi Video Editor, which I’d used before for basic timeline edits. Turns out it has a background replacement tool now. Also, the UI doesn’t feel like I’m programming a microwave, which is a win in my book.

So I just went to the AI background removal section, uploaded my clip, and boom – it did its thing. I dropped in a stock photo of an office that looks way fancier than my real one. Instant credibility upgrade.

# Some Tips I Picked Up the Hard Way

* **Lighting is still king**: even with AI tools, if your lighting is trash, your edges will look like a haunted aura. Try to get even lighting from both sides. I used two cheap desk lamps with white paper over them. Budget? Yes. Functional? Also yes.
* **Don’t wear the same color as your wall/background**: unless you want to cosplay as a floating head.
* **Stick to subtle backgrounds**: I once tried replacing my background with a moving cityscape. Looked like I was about to be hit by a CGI taxi. Go for something low-key – a blurred room, a clean gradient, something easy on the eyes.
* **Export small sections to test**: Some editors get laggy or crash-prone when processing background changes. Don’t do a full 10-minute render on your first go. Trust me. Learned this after crashing my machine at 95% render... twice.

Also – quick side tip: record your original footage at the highest res you can. AI tools seem to get cleaner edges when your image is sharper. And don’t film at night unless you want every shadow behind you to turn into a visual jump scare.

# Where I’m At Now

So yeah – I'm still learning, but I can now fake a decent-looking background without needing a green screen or $100/month software. Most of my workflow now is: shoot in decent lighting, use an AI video editor to strip the background, overlay something clean, toss in captions, and boom – fake studio vibes.

Not saying it’s perfect, but it’s light-years better than trying to mask hair strands manually while crying into your coffee.

Do I still get the occasional glitchy shoulder or floating artifact near my elbow? Yes. But do I care less than I did a month ago? Also yes. At some point, ""good enough"" becomes the holy grail of online content creation.

Anyway, if anyone here has better tips, horror stories, or favorite tools for easy background swaps, I’d love to hear them. Especially if you’ve figured out how to do it fast without sacrificing quality (or your sanity).

## When is the Best Time to Visit Rome?

Timing is everything. Your experience can vary dramatically depending on the season.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### **Spring (April - May)**
This is arguably the best time to visit Rome. The weather is pleasantly warm and perfect for strolling, flowers are in bloom, and the peak summer crowds haven't yet arrived.
*   **Pros:** Ideal weather, fewer crowds than summer.
*   **Cons:** Prices can be high, especially around Easter.

### **Summer (June - August)**
The city is buzzing with energy, but it's also hot and crowded. This is peak season. Be prepared for long lines and soaring temperatures.
*   **Pros:** Lively atmosphere, all outdoor events are in full swing.
*   **Cons:** Very hot and humid, largest crowds, highest prices. Many locals leave for vacation in August.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### **Autumn (September - October)**
Like spring, autumn offers a sweet spot. The intense summer heat fades, the crowds thin out, and the light takes on a beautiful golden hue perfect for photos.
*   **Pros:** Great weather, comfortable temperatures, fewer crowds.
*   **Cons:** Rain becomes more likely towards the end of October.

### **Winter (November - February)**
The fewest tourists visit Rome in winter. While it can be chilly and rainy, the reward is a more intimate experience. Imagine having the Pantheon almost to yourself!
*   **Pros:** Lowest prices, minimal crowds, cozy atmosphere.
*   **Cons:** Can be cold and rainy, some shorter daylight hours.

## How Many Days Do You Need in Rome?

You could spend a lifetime in Rome and still not see it all. But for a first visit, here’s a realistic breakdown:

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### **The Rome Taster (2-3 Days)**
This is a whirlwind trip focused on the absolute essentials. You'll hit the big three: Ancient Rome (Colosseum, Forum), the Vatican City, and the historic center (Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Spanish Steps). It will be busy, but you'll see the icons.

### **The Classic Experience (4-5 Days)**
This is the sweet spot. It gives you enough time to see the main attractions without feeling completely rushed. You can explore charming neighborhoods like Trastevere, visit an incredible museum like the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, and even take a day trip to Ostia Antica or Tivoli.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

### **The Deep Dive (6+ Days)**
With a week or more, you can truly conquer Rome. You can revisit your favorite spots, explore off-the-beaten-path areas, take a cooking class, and fully immerse yourself in the *dolce vita* lifestyle. You’ll have time to see the major sites and relax, which is the key to a great trip.

## The Unmissable Rome Attractions: Your First-Timer's Checklist

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

This is your core itinerary. Book tickets for major sites in advance to save hours of waiting in line.

1.  **The Colosseum, Roman Forum & Palatine Hill**
    The heart of Ancient Rome. The Colosseum is iconic, but don't rush through the Forum, the sprawling ruins of Rome's social and political center. Your ticket usually covers all three.
    > **Pro Tip:** Book a ""Colosseum Underground"" tour. It costs more, but you get access to restricted areas and skip the massive general admission lines.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

2.  **Vatican City (St. Peter's Basilica, St. Peter's Square, Vatican Museums & Sistine Chapel)**
    The world's smallest independent state is a powerhouse of art and religion. St. Peter's Basilica is awe-inspiring and free to enter (but expect a security line). The Vatican Museums are vast, leading you to the magnificent Sistine Chapel.
    > **Pro Tip:** Book the earliest possible entry time for the Vatican Museums (8 AM). You'll beat the worst of the crowds and enjoy the Sistine Chapel in relative peace before it becomes a human zoo.

3.  **Pantheon**
    A marvel of ancient engineering. This former Roman temple, with its incredible dome and oculus, is now a church. It's free to enter and best experienced early in the morning or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & Hotels for Your Next Trip
](https://govacation.pages.dev/)

4.  **Trevi Fountain**
    Toss a coin over your shoulder to ensure your return to Rome. It's breathtakingly beautiful, but always packed. Go at sunrise (around 6 AM) for a magical, crowd-free experience.

5.  **Piazza Navona**
    Rome's most beautiful baroque piazza, home to stunning fountains by Bernini. It's the perfect place to grab a coffee or an aperitivo and watch the world go by.

*   **Trastevere:** A charming neighborhood across the Tiber River with cobblestone streets, ivy-covered buildings, and fantastic restaurants. It feels like a small village within the city.
*   **Quartiere Coppedè:** A tiny, surreal architectural fantasyland you won't believe exists in Rome. A quick visit is like stepping into a fairy tale.
*   **Palazzo Doria Pamphilj:** A vast, private art gallery on a opulent, aristocratic family's former home. It's less crowded than the Vatican Museums and houses masterpieces by Velázquez, Caravaggio, and Raphael.
*   **The Aventine Keyhole:** Head to the Priory of the Knights of Malta on the Aventine Hill and peek through the keyhole of its green door. You'll see a perfectly framed view of St. Peter's Dome.

To visit Rome is to eat. Don't leave without trying these Roman classics.

*   **Pasta:** Order the four Roman pastas: *Cacio e Pepe* (cheese and pepper), *Carbonara* (egg, pecorino, guanciale), *Amatriciana* (tomato, pecorino, guanciale), and *Gricia* (like carbonara without the egg).
*   **Supplì:** Fried balls of rice stuffed with mozzarella. The perfect street food snack.
*   **Pizza al Taglio:** Pizza by the slice, sold by weight. A quick, cheap, and delicious lunch.
*   **Gelato:** Save room for gelato. Always. Look for shops with natural-looking colors and covered tubs.
*   **Aperitivo:** In the early evening, join locals for a pre-dinner drink. You usually pay for a cocktail and get access to a buffet of snacks.

## Essential Tips for Your First Visit to Rome

*   **Wear comfortable shoes.** You will walk more than you ever have in your life.
*   **Stay hydrated.** Rome has free, clean drinking water fountains called *nasoni* all over the city. Bring a water bottle.
*   **Book everything in advance.** The Colosseum, Vatican Museums, and popular tours. It's the single best way to save time.
*   **Learn a few Italian phrases.** *Buongiorno* (good morning), *Grazie* (thank you), and *Prego* (you're welcome) go a long way.
*   **Be aware of your surroundings.** Like in any major city, be mindful of pickpockets, especially on crowded buses and at major tourist sites.

Rome is more than a destination; it's an experience that will stay with you forever. It's a city that demands you to get lost, to look up, to taste everything, and to slow down and simply be present. So pack your bags, bring your appetite, and get ready to fall in love with the Eternal City. Your Roman adventure awaits",1,1762515610.0,GoItaly,0,1.0,False

1oqs2r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/analyzeme/comments/1oqs2r4/would_you_restart_your_life_if_you_could/,Would you restart your life if you could?,"I saw that question posed today here on this website.

Today, I am in my mid-60s, retired from a long and demanding career, have been married and divorced, have raised two children into adulthood, and have experienced many great joys, and perhaps even a greater number of profound sorrows.

I had a difficult childhood, and a painfully difficult marriage.

But I am more content with my life than I have ever been.

I am at peace, I am happy, I have no ego, I seek no competition with anyone.

I do not want anything, I have no expectations, I do not demand accountability, I do not demand anything from anybody.  

I am finally fully cognizant of the fact that I have no control over other people, and that I cannot make people feel, think, or behave in any particular way.

*That the only thing I do have complete control over* are the decisions and the choices that I make for myself.

My needs are very simple.

I am content to be.

I understand myself, I understand the roots of my behavior, I understand how profoundly my childhood affects me, even to this very day.

I sometimes feel very ancient feelings that are rooted in my childhood experiences, but I am at long last able to manage those feelings, and to manage my behavior and the way I comport myself when those unpleasant feelings escape the recesses of my unconscious and make themselves available to me. 

So that those old feelings do not interfere with the way that I behave, or the way I relate to other human beings.

Understanding the reasons that we feel about things the way we do takes a lifetime of experience.  

(It can also take a lifetime of experience to understand how important it is that we need to understand the reasons that we feel about things the way we do.  Another of life’s ironies.)

It is not something that someone can simply tell you to do, and then magically, you are able to do it. 

It is a learned skill, and it is a skill that gives very powerful insight.

Personally, *I regard this insight as the greatest gift that life has to offer.*

Socrates himself said it best: “the unexamined life is not worth living.“

Meantime, the months and the years go by at an increasingly rapid pace... It's hard to believe that it is already November.  

I met my daughter for coffee yesterday, and we were talking about how the two of us went out to a fancy restaurant for Thanksgiving last year (2024), and here we are again, getting ready to spend Thanksgiving together in a couple of weeks.

I told her that I remember our last Thanksgiving dinner together like it was yesterday. (She is in her mid-20s and was surprised, as for her it seemed like it happened ages ago.)

And the seasons are changing more rapidly than they used to... I remember how time would move at a glacial pace when I was in my 20s and 30s.

But these days, I hardly notice how fast the time passes.  Nor I am not afraid of the passage of time.  

In fact, I don't even think about the passage of time, and I often wonder whether my lack of concern is the result of my introspection and self-examination, or nature's way of allowing me to enjoy what I think are the best years of my life.

Indeed, I used to think that the concept of the “universe” was sort of silly, but no longer.  I am firmly convinced that the universe (and the forces that shape the universe) is truly omnipotent, perhaps as omnipotent as our own unconscious.  

If for no other reason than we ourselves are composed of the same material as everything else in the universe.  

I have personally concluded that daily life is more of a contest between our unconscious and the universe, than it is between our unconscious and conscious.  (I am not yet sure whether our conscious is part of the universe or not.  But that is definitely an idea worth exploring.)
___

I guess if I were to answer the question above — would I start my life over again if I could  — I would decline the opportunity.

I would not want to risk starting my life over, if there was even the most infinitesimal chance that I would not feel as good as I currently do.

When we are young, we are full of life, in good health, attractive, with a lot of stamina that is required to do things like raise young children.  Yet for most of us, managing human relationships, and in particular, raising children can be difficult and challenging.  And the reason is because we are most often unable to separate ourselves, emotionally and psychologically, from others, and to fully understand that others are unique, independent, autonomous human beings whose experiences and perceptions of reality have absolutely nothing to do with ours.

It is only later in life, when we have lost some of our looks, or lost some of our energy, and are no longer able to reproduce that we like to think we have gained what passes for “wisdom“ that might well have been useful for us when we were younger.

It is a paradox of life that I find fascinating.

1oqs1ca,https://i.redd.it/6idcdjromtzf1.jpeg,Shoulder to Shoulder men's community - update,"Hello all,

We posted about our men's group on here a couple of weeks ago and we got so much support from the r/london community. I wanted to share an update on what's happened since the viral post.

We have grown to over 1,000 members within the group and now have sub groups for different parts of London (as well as groups for specific interests), each of these groups has created their own spontaneous meet-ups across the city - connecting guys that otherwise wouldn't have had the chance to.

We've seen a significant number of the guys in the group enquire about our partnership with subsidised therapy provider, Counterpoise.

Our bookclub group leader has created the first IRL bookclub meetup on Nov 30 in West London.

We've been approached by Interflora who, for International Men's Day, are gifting some incredible bouquets of flowers to the guys who have contributed the most to the group - be that through advice, support or facilitating important conversations.

We're creating a leadership committee where some of the members play specific roles, whether that's professional mentoring, coaching, mental health support.

I'm absolutely blown away by what's happened in the space of just two weeks, and a huge reason for that is this community, so thank you. I really mean that. 

And a reminder, our regular walk and coffee event happens every other Sunday at 11am in Hyde Park - this Sunday is the next one for any guys that want to join.

1oqs0re,https://www.reddit.com/r/artttt/comments/1oqs0re/the_back_acne_i_developed_from_binding_hurts_so_i/,The back acne I developed from binding hurts so I wrote this cringe st4t to cope (content warning for slight invasion of personal space),"She was working at her computer, as I graded my student's papers. An exhale heavy with disappointed came to me, reading the academic-level writing style of that one students who thought Hiroshima and Nagasaki were two people. I'm forced to give it a good grade for its correct content, despite the obvious use of AI that I can't prove. Not that I want to, frankly: This month I already endured an angry mother demanding why I gave her daughter a bad grade, and she wouldn't back up, no matter how I explained that ""No Ma'am, I do not think your child is dumb, she simply hasn't studied so I'm legally obliged to score her negatively"". Refraining from also explaining that ""You're taking this worse than she did. Maybe monitor your child and her learning next time, how about that? How about you don't scream to the fucking guy in charge of your daughter's education? Not that you fucking care if she lives or dies, clearly, no mother who cares about anything over her own image behaves like this. But of course, it's my fucking fault for trying to do something with your walking unwanted pregnancy"".

I took the pen again; swift like a sword and thoughtless like a habit, I give the essay the undeserved score that will make the boy who wrote it the man of the house for a night.  


""They used AI again?"" She asked me, noticing my sigh. I looked up at her: She took off her glasses to rest her eyes, putting them on the coffee table next to the computer. She clinged to the wool blanket I bought her at ikea earlier this month, for the autumn was particularly cold this year; it clinges to her sweater, the one with the Igorrr print. 

""Yeah"", I reply ""I don't know why I even bother. It's the fourth time this one guy uses it, and he's not the only one, for a subject I spent two weeks teaching. God forbid he actually uses his brain"".

""Who cares, he's gonna fail anyway"" She replied with her usual eternally tired tone, putting on her glasses again. ""Sooner or later he'll be fucked when another teacher finds him out, or will be fired by a boss when he'll be caught using AI for stocks or whatever the fuck teen boys are into these days"".

""You'd be surprised how many of my students are into economics"".

""Obviously, it's always the dumb ones"".

I laughed a little, although I don't like to think the developping children I have to teach to as dumb. ""For real though,"" I said after a moment ""I don't want him or any of them to fail. But it's kind of inevitable after a while, I can't take them by the hand forever"".

A part of me wishes I could, and she knows it. She didn't reply, because she didn't have anything to say, and I know it. We both were destroyed by the education system and the people surrounding it; I reacted by becoming a teacher in the hope to help the teens I was once one of and she went as far away as possible by working in cybersecurity.

I put the essay with the other graded ones, reaching for another one from the pile on my left; This time it's made by a bright girl in my 2 PM class, a little too chatty during lessons but always serious when it comes to tests. My hopes were restored.  
Two minutes into reading, I felt a quick pressure on my ribs and a slight pain. I grunted a little, massaging my side, Hopelessy thinking she hasn't heard me from the couch four feet away where she is currently sitting.

""You aren't still binding, right"".

She didn't phrase it as a question; she knew I was. It wasn't an accusatory tone, more like deadpan and worried. It's the one my mother used when she knew my father forgot one of the thousand things we needed during holydays, when we were already far from home.

""Yes, I forgot"". I replied quickly, massaging my nape, ""I'll take it off after I finish grading the essays"".

""How about now?""

""It doesn't hurt that much and I'm halfway done. I can handle it"".

""It took you two hours to grade half those papers and you have been binding since this morning. You aren't and idiot so you know when it's time to take it off, like right now"".

I inhaled with my eyes closed, knowing that when she decides something has to be done now, there's no winning. But she's right: It does hurt and I have been wearing it for far too long. She's much less lenient comparing to the first months of dating, when I just confessed to over bind.

I got up from our living room table. ""Do you mind if i change in front of you? So I can fold it and put it back later"" I asked. She nodded.

I took my sweater off, the one with the Deftones print she gifted me for my last birthday; It became worn out and off-white, the horse silhouette cracked from so many washes. The cold of the late afternoon hit my lower back and then my shoulders when I took my binder off. Instant relief came to me, and with it a familiar hand: She got up while I wasn't looking and came up behind me.

""Of course it hurts, you have zits on your back"" She comments. I can feel the nails she hasn't trimmed in a week, the smoothness of her chipped black nailpaint on my shoulder blades.

""I know, yes"" I replied quickly, caught by surprise from the feeling of her cold hands.

I didn't like it when people touched me without asking, I hated physical contact in general. But she was always careful; always asking me when she could touch my hands, my belly, when she could lean forward to kiss me. With time her touch became easier to accept, as I learned it like an unfamiliar language I was curious of. In that moment the sensation on my irritated skin wasn't really pleasant, but I didn't tell her to stop.

She took my long hair and moved them on my chest, leaving my back completely exposed to the cold.

""What are you doing?""

""Quiet"".

Her nails scratched me, righ on top of my shoulders and then again, on the sides of my ribs. She continued, dragging horizontally from the start of my nape to the start of my tailbone and then in circle patterns all around my lower back. When she focused on one part another screamed for her touch, as I inhaled deeply and closed my eyes, letting her relieve my itch. At one point, she scraped in between my shoulder blades, where my acne was the most acute; I hissed, until I felt the pressure of her nails leave to trace somewhere else, leaving a burning pain that felt like release. She even reached around to scratch my beard, on the underside of my chin and jaw.

She hummed. I could sense her smile behind me, ""There you go,"" she said, her voice soft but her breath cold, lingering on my skin like the wind of the autumnt evenings we both  loved. I whined, low at the back of my throat, as she reached places I could never see and touch on my own. She did it again and again, all over my back, itching at my skin until all I could feel was her all over me, relieving me of the pressure and irritation of an entire day.

After a couple minutes she stopped and hugged me from behind, her hands resting on top of my belly button, her chin on my shoulder ""There. better?""

""Yes,"" I whispered, content and a little ashamed of how much I needed this; needed her. ""Thank you. Thank you"".

She kissed my shoulder and let go of me, going back on the couch. I quickly put back my sweater, while she repositioned her computer on the coffee table to leave some space.

""If you aren't uncomfortable you can get the papers here, so we can work next to each other"" She said. I smiled.

""I'd like that, yes. I was thinking of getting some tea, since it's pretty cold. You want some?""

""Yes, thank you"".

  
English is not my first language and I'm still an amateur writer so any opinion and feedback is accepted. I'm cold and I can't bind a lot these days but writing this comforted me. Thank you for reading.",3,1762515180.0,artttt,0,1.0,False

Here's a tip to save a few euro when you purchase. Enough to have leftover for an extra coffee each time maybe with normal retail purchase quantities

For all ETFs purchasable, either the ETF service provider or their liquidity provider (if the service provider doesn't do it themselves) will quote bid and ask prices onto the exchange that represents the NAV of the ETF. The provider profits in the size of the spread between the two. Usually your broker will show you these prices and the quantity on offer on the two sides.

If you submit a market order type you will be taking automatically from the price on the opposite side that the provider is offering (and doing this you help them with max profit)

You can (because it's safer) submit a limit order type with price set to match the price quoted on the opposite side, and if you do this you will also get filled at the provider's quoted price (but again you help them with max profit)

However to save a few euro, it's actually usually best for you to submit a limit order type WITHIN the spread a few price points more beneficial to you than what the provider is quoting. The reason is because most providers will apply ""pounce"" or ""snipe"" algos to take limit orders submitted ""close enough"" within their spread ranges. Although it won't help them with the max spread profit they want, they usually have ""this is good enough"" configuration limits set for snipe in their algorithms that you'd never know about. 

I've been saving €2-4 on most purchases doing this for a long time

If you do it and you don't get sniped for a saving on your ETF you can just amend your limit order to match the spread quote levels on offer exactly. But best to try first !",9,1762514966.0,ETFs_Europe,0,1.0,False

I'm a solo dev who just shipped **Smeshly** with the first model **sFusion1-Lite** – pure photogrammetry + AI enhancements, running on cheap cloud CPUs where possible.

Quick cost-saving tip running photogrammetry in the cloud:  
I ditched Google Cloud GPUs completely and switched to Runpod. Now I run **all non-essential photogrammetry steps on CPU** – yes, it takes longer, but costs drop to pennies per scan instead of euros. Huge win if you're doing this in the cloud yourself!

**What works right now (Open bTesting live):**

* Phone photos → mesh generation using just your Android phone
* Download only as PLY for now
* Token system: **5000 free tokens per month** (enough for 5–15 full scans depending on photo count), subscription for more tokens

[Play Store link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smeshly.app)

**Now YOUR input – this is make-or-break for me.**

I'm deciding what to build next. Which features are so game-changing and unique that you'd instantly subscribe to an app because you absolutely need them?

Upvote the ones that matter most ↓

1. **CAD conversion** – turn photo scans into parametric .STEP files (real engineering-ready models)
2. **Single-image 3D** – AI generates full model from just one photo
3. **Text-to-3D** – type ""red sports car with spoilers"" → instant printable model
4. **Perfect watertight meshes + auto-hole-filling** (zero 3D-print fails, no fine tuning needed)
5. **In-app object cutter** – draw a loop → keep only that part (scan room → get just the chair)
6. **True AR scaling on Android** – place model in real world with 100 % accurate size (no more ""looks small on screen"")
7. **Other?** → comment your dream feature!

**Big question:**  
What’s the ONE thing missing in EVERY mobile photogrammetry app that drives you nuts?

Campaign holds Major Orders and we have following Campaigns:

Stable: (are available all the time)

*Progress Campaign*  
*War Campaign*  
*Personal Campaign*

Special: (are available occasionally)

*Special Campaign*  
*Defensive Campaign*

*Progress Campaign* would contain Major Orders aimed at getting stuff for progress in technology. It could circle MO for all fronts (bots - scrap, bugs - oil, squids - blueprints). Win in this MO would mean progress (and eventually new technology - stratagem). DSS could show this progress and players could vote for next stratagem to be developed.

*War Campaign* would always contain three MO, each for one front. Players could vote for next planet to be subject of war effort for every front. Taking the planet would win MO. Winning all three MO would win campaign.

*Personal Campaign* would contain personal orders. Primary PO would be same as is now. But completing it would unlock three more PO, each for one front.

*Special Campaign* holds events like celebrations, holly days and such.

*Defensive Campaign* holds special MO that are only available if Super Earth of other critical planet needs special defend effort.

Rewards and timelines:

**Progress Campaign**, duration: 2-4 days, reward for completing Camp is 10 medals for every day of duration. Max 40 medals.

**War Campaign**, duration 4 days, completing entire Camp gives 20 medals, completing each MO gives 10 medals. Max 50 medals.

**Personal Campaign**, duration: 24 hours, main PO gives 10 medals, each of front PO gives 5 medals, bonus 10 SC for completing entire personal campaign, max 25 medals.

**Special Campaign**, duration 1 day, gives 100 medals

**Defensive Campaign**, duration 2 days, gives 50 medals

Finally, why?

1. Well, I really miss times when we had to fight to get new stuff. It was great feeling to ""participate"" in world creation, even if just remotely.
2. This system would not divide players. All fronts would have same amount of attention.
3. Players participation, people would vote for next target planet. This would give people idea of control over the story (and adds division that number 2 removed)
4. Steady progress, ability to coordinate would mean that map would show some real progress. JOEL would need to put aside his coffee and put real effort into planning. We would stop being bunch of running chickens and become precisely aimed force of Freedom
5. more stuff to list through for those moments when you are in game but don't feel like taking another mission straight away

Post scriptum:

Because this would generate a lot of medals (and for many players those are useless until new Warbond drops), I suggest to include ability of player to change medals for requisitions or samples.",1,1762514446.0,Helldivers,1,0.67,False

Chapter 18: The Compact Zone.

(Flashback)

It was 11:00 PM when Otto reached his destination. The Gignian Compact Zone was not a diplomatic mission; it was a gigantic, fenced-off industrial and residential area on the outskirts of Berlin. The night sky here wasn't lit by streetlights, but by the harsh, industrial floodlights of factories and the powerful lamps of the docks where super-fortresses were being built. The air was cold, and Otto felt his own, human fear mixing with a primal, reptilian anxiety.

Guards stood at the gate. Their armor looked alien—it was neither the human Guard armor nor the durable Plague carapaces he had seen in recordings. It was angular, symmetrical, gleaming dully in the light of the floodlights. Otto approached hesitantly.

To his surprise, one of the guards detached from the group and walked towards him. It was a male of his own species. A Taharagch. He was powerful, and his black, composite armor bore the same geometric sigil of the Compact that Otto had seen on W’thiara.

""She told me you would be. You must be Otto,"" the voice, processed by Otto’s translator, was rough but not hostile. The guard nodded to the others. ""Let him through.""

The gate opened with a hiss. The guard pointed a clawed hand deep into the complex.

""Head straight to the indicated address, about one of your Earth kilometers. Then 300 meters to the right, that's where our species' barracks are.""

Otto started walking at a steady pace, though his heart was pounding like a hammer. He felt eyes on him. There was movement all around, despite the late hour. It was the changing of the guard at the factories and shipyards. He saw representatives of many alien species passing him. Powerful, four-armed Gignians walked with heavy steps, their armor clanking. Beside them darted agile Naratans with hyena-like faces, laughing loudly at some private joke. They all wore the Compact sigil on their shoulders.

They were smiling at each other. Otto paused for a moment, seeing a scene that seemed surreal to him: one of his own brethren, a male Taharagch, walking next to a Gignian, patted him friendly on his massive armor. It looked like a real compact. A true alliance fighting for a better tomorrow.

He turned right, as instructed. And then he felt it.

He felt it in his nostrils. The same scent that had hit him in the park, but now it was magnified. Thick, musky, electrifying. Pheromones. The scent of females. Not one. An entire pack.

His reptilian instinct exploded. He felt a wave of heat at the base of his tail, and his body tensed in a way he could barely control. The fear vanished, replaced by pure, biological lust. He began to nervously press his own neck gland, trying to regain control, to suppress the instinct that had always been stifled and was now howling.

He reached the barracks. It was simple, functional. The door opened automatically.

He went inside. In the common room sat several female Taharagch. Their slender, powerful silhouettes in loose, civilian clothes were a sight that almost made Otto lose his breath.

""Oh, you're here,"" W’thiara said, looking up at him from some kind of data pad.

Several other females turned their heads towards him. Their gazes were shameless, appraising, amused.

""Is that him?"" he heard a voice in his translator. ""Not bad.""

Another one chuckled softly.

""A virgin.""

It was three in the morning. It was already over.

Otto lay on his stomach, breathing heavily. His back stung as if someone had run sandpaper over it. He knew it was covered in scratches. W’thiara had not been gentle; her long, sharp talons had dug into his scales and skin during the act with a force that had nothing in common with a human caress. It was a fight for dominance, a primal, brutal ritual that had awakened instincts he never knew he had. Fortunately, the nanites were already at work; he felt the characteristic, cool tingling as the microscopic machines patched up his tissues.

He rolled onto his side. The bedding was covered in blood. His blood.

""Jesus... am I... sorry?"" he croaked, still stunned by the intensity of the experience, assuming he had been the one to hurt her.

W’thiara lay beside him, calm, her breathing even. She stretched lazily like a panther.

""It's nothing, Otto,"" her voice in the translator was slightly amused. ""This blood is a good sign. Our copulation is quite brutal. We use claws and teeth to hold our partner. It's instinct. And your blood on the sheets..."" she ran a nail over his chest, ""...means I enjoyed myself.""

""Ah..."" Otto grunted. That was... new. Completely different from the cautious, human encounters he had tried. Trying to change the subject and calm his racing thoughts, he said, ""I saw many of our kind here. Males, too.""

""Yes,"" W’thiara sat up, leaning against the headboard. ""The planet the Compact liberated... Naratan... was actually a breeding world for the Plague Empire. When the Gignian Compact forces broke through the defenses, they found not just factories, but incubation facilities.""

""Willingly or not, they recovered over a billion small children. An entire generation, still in growth chambers. We were young, without the consciousness implant yet installed. Blank slates. The Compact saved us. They raised us. Gave us an education, a purpose. And this is how we live. As full citizens of the Compact.""

""Besides,"" she continued, breaking his silence, her voice becoming strangely distant, ""my original is still alive there. On Naratan. I am just her copy. Thanks to your idea of building allied fleets here, my original was designated for copying and transmission here.""

She ran her hand over his bare back, her touch now more probing than caressing.

""I am here alone. Even though I have her memories... my family, who is still there. Hundreds of light-years separate us.""

Otto felt a cold chill run down his spine, one that had nothing to do with arousal. The terror of the consequences.

""God... they copied you? They forced your consciousness into such a separation?""

W’thiara let out a low, throaty laugh. ""The Compact is logical. Compared to the Empire, the Compact are angels. I get regular quantum messages from all of them. I know how they're doing. It's enough. But..."" she trailed off, and her gaze became intense again. ""Speaking of consequences... How many eggs do you want?""

Otto blinked. His head was spinning.

""Eggs? What do you mean? An egg with a youngling?""

""Well, yes."" W’thiara propped herself up on her elbows, looking down at him. Her expression was completely serious, as if she were asking about the weather. ""Our cycle works differently. I was in heat. You were... available. I should expel them in a week. You just need to keep them warm for about three of your months, and they'll hatch on their own.""

""Just... like that?!"" Otto felt faint. This was worse than the pressure on his gland.

""Well, yes."" She shrugged. ""If you don't want the eggs, I'll just smash them all right after expelling them. They won't even be embryos yet. No problem.""

Otto tried to gather his thoughts. Children. Offspring. With her.

""And... and how many could there be?""

""From three to seven. Usually.""

""Oh God... I could have young. All seven of them."" The vision of seven small, silver-scaled reptilians running around his Berlin apartment was simultaneously terrifying and... wonderful.

W’thiara laughed aloud.

""Sex has its consequences, Otto.""

She leaned over him. Her long, sharp talon traced over his back, finding one of the healing wounds from their act. With a decisive, quick movement, she reopened it. Otto hissed in pain.

""These Swarm nanites of yours spoil all the fun,"" she muttered, watching as blood began to slowly seep onto the sheets again. ""I like it when marks are left behind.""

With the arrival of a larger, more diverse Gignian Compact population, including Naratans and other Taharagch, Otto's unique role as a Guard instructor diminished somewhat. He was still a legend and a veteran of the challenge, but he was no longer the sole expert on fighting his own kind. Suddenly, he had more time for himself.

He spent that time with W’thiara. They met whenever their schedules—his in the Guard, hers in the Compact shipyards—allowed. What had started in the park was not a one-time explosion. It was something much deeper, something Otto barely understood.

It was pure, animal magnetism. When she was near, his reptilian instincts, so long suppressed by his human upbringing, roared to life. He could smell her before she even entered the room. Every fluid, predatory movement she made drew his eye. He was utterly captivated by her.

They were lying in her sterile, Compact-issued barrack after another brutal, scratch-filled encounter. Otto could feel his nanites already working on the marks her talons had left on his shoulders.

""I have a question,"" he finally asked, breaking the silence. He watched as she nonchalantly cleaned her long nails. ""Are you... with anyone else besides me?""

W’thiara looked at him, genuinely surprised.

""Of course. In our species, females can have many partners, even while having a permanent one. It's biology, Otto.""

She put down the nail tool and smiled predatorily.

""The same applies to you. You can have someone else, too. In my barracks, the others have their eye on you. That 'virgin' status of yours turned out to be very... intriguing.""

Otto shook his head.

""I can't do that. I was raised on Earth, in their culture, practically alone. For me, monogamy is normal. I want to ask you... would you like to try? Just with me?""

W’thiara studied him for a moment, as if analyzing a new, surprising data set. His request, from her perspective as someone raised by the Compact, was absurd. Almost childish. To limit biological options because of a human concept called ""exclusivity""? And yet, this male was different. His strange, human mind trapped in a powerful, reptilian body... his suppressed instinct that exploded around her... it was fascinating.

""An interesting experiment,"" she murmured finally, a note of scientific curiosity in her voice. ""It costs nothing. I agree.""

Otto felt a wave of relief so strong it almost made him dizzy. She agreed. Maybe she didn't understand it the way he did, but she agreed. Emboldened, he went a step further.

""And I want you to come to my place. To my apartment in downtown Berlin. Can you?""

W’thiara's smile became more practical. She reminded him of the reality they lived in.

""I'm not a tourist, Otto. I am under the jurisdiction of the Compact. If I get permission to leave the zone and stay overnight, I'll let you know. If I can get it.""

W’thiara got the permit. When her air transport settled on the landing pad in central Berlin, she felt like she had landed on a different planet. Berlin of the future was a marvel of engineering and chaos. Giant, glass buildings climbed towards the sky, and between them, on various levels, thousands of silent, flying vehicles zipped past. The street level was surprisingly human—full of pedestrians, greenery, and dozens of eateries from which aromas from all over the world wafted.

She stood for a moment, taking in the view. It was her first time here; leaving the Compact zone was a rarity. She saw laughing people sitting in café gardens. But she also saw the ubiquitous Guard propaganda. Giant holograms of Admiral Thorne looked down on the city with a stern, fatherly expression, and the Guard logo adorned nearly every other building.

""Come on, you'll have Chinese,"" Otto pulled her hand towards a small, unassuming joint. ""I like this place.""

The interior was small and loud. The owner, an older Asian man, greeted them, smiling broadly at Otto from behind the bar.

""The usual, boss?""

""Yes, two sweet and sour chickens with rice, please. Spicy.""

W’thiara ate, her eyes widening with every bite. The flame of the hot spices exploded in her mouth.

""This is fucking good... Spicy,"" she rasped, reaching for water. ""We don't have meals like this in the Compact. Ours are more averaged, balanced.""

""I know,"" Otto smiled, already finishing his portion. ""I've eaten your rations.""

He paid, and then they walked to his nearby apartment. As they entered the elevator, a neighbor with a dog greeted him. At the sight of Otto, the dog yelped with joy and threw itself at him in a friendly greeting, trying to lick his legs.

W’thiara instinctively took a step back.

""A dog. Don't be afraid,"" Otto laughed, scratching the animal behind the ears. ""It's an animal. Humans keep them in their homes.""

""What for?"" she asked, her analytical mind unable to process the concept. It was not a food source or a combat unit.

Otto petted the dog, and it licked his claws in response.

""For pleasure.""

W’thiara laughed, fearlessly taking a healthy swig from the unmarked bottle Otto handed her. It was moonshine, specially prepared for him by a human moonshiner he had met back in the Guard. The concoction was 80% alcohol. Something that would be a terrible, even lethal dose for a human, was simply... pleasantly warming for her reptilian physiology.

She laughed, her throaty voice filling the apartment. Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

Otto opened it. In the doorway stood Lyra and Jimmy, both clearly drunk, holding a bottle of something that looked equally suspicious.

""Hey! What are you guys doing here? You didn't call, nothing..."" Otto was genuinely surprised.

""Ah, we saw you in town, walking to your place!"" Lyra waved her hand, walking inside uninvited, with Jimmy right behind her. ""By chance. So we're crashing your party like jerks. Hope you have something to drink!""

Otto laughed heartily.

""Good to see you. W’thiara, this is Jimmy and Lyra. My best friends. Guards, like me."" He looked at them with a warmth he rarely showed. ""They were the first to treat me as one of their own. Like a human."" He turned back to W’thiara. ""Which must have been hard for them. They fought our kind on Proxima b.""

W’thiara approached and offered them her hand. She already knew this human gesture.

""Nice to meet you.""

The evening quickly picked up speed. The moonshine flowed. It was full of alcohol, memories, and stories. Otto, feeling at ease among his closest friends, told W’thiara about his sparring matches with Jimmy.

""This one here,"" he pointed at Jimmy, who was currently trying to explain the rules of poker to W’thiara, ""tried to beat the crap out of me three times in a row. And you know what the best part is? I was unarmored, and he was testing the latest Hoplite 4.0 armor prototype on me! And he still couldn't win!""

Jimmy just smiled his typical, ironic smirk.

Otto also spoke about K’tharr. About how powerful that warrior had been.

""I couldn't do anything against him, despite all my training. Despite all the sparring and drills. He was just... better.""

W’thiara suddenly grew serious, setting her glass down.

""K’tharr?"" She knew the name. ""Yes, we know him. He's one of their oldest fleet commanders. He started from the lowest rank, was just a warrior. From what we know from Compact intelligence data, he's had about 200 incarnations, not counting transfers to other regions. Which means, with our natural lifespan, about or even over two thousand of your years of experience.""

Otto stared at her, astonished.

""You didn't stand a chance,"" W’thiara smiled and affectionately scratched him lightly on the arm with a claw, almost the same way he had petted the dog earlier.

Meanwhile, Lyra and Jimmy, completely drunk and uninterested in strategic conversations about ancient reptiles, were making out on the couch, paying no attention to their hosts. Their whispers mingled with giggles. Jimmy's hand wandered under Lyra's shirt, and she, instead of stopping him, pulled him closer, kissing him hard and wetly on the neck. Their affections became less and less subtle, and the sounds of smacking kisses and quiet moans began to mix with Otto's stories.

Otto and W’thiara looked at each other with amusement.

An hour later, Jimmy and Lyra were fast asleep on the couch in a tight, drunken embrace.

In the morning, they were awakened not by an alarm, but by a loud sizzling sound coming from the kitchen. Jimmy was the first one up. While the rest were sleeping soundly after the rough night, he, like a true veteran, had switched to combat mode—fighting the hangover. He was bustling around Otto's kitchen, making breakfast.

Otto was the second to get up. His reptilian physiology handled alcohol much better than a human's, but he still felt a slight buzzing in his head. A moment later, W’thiara woke up, stretching with a grace that seemed completely at odds with last night's intoxication.

The last to wake, with a loud groan, was Lyra. She dragged herself off the couch, almost naked—last night's party must have had a hot finale, as she was sleeping only in her underwear. She grabbed her head, muttering something under her breath about dying.

""Scrambled eggs with butter!"" Jimmy announced joyfully from the kitchen, entering the living room with a steaming pan. ""Lots of fat, it'll get us back on our feet. Plus bacon and fresh bread.""

W’thiara, who was observing the human morning rituals with curiosity, tried the scrambled eggs. Her eyes widened slightly.

""A very good dish,"" she said to Otto, taking another forkful.

""They're eggs,"" Otto explained. ""Just from chickens, birds, but the kind that can't fly.""

""And the bacon?"" she asked, pointing to a crispy strip.

""A type of meat. Fatty, but tasty. Thin slices.""

The morning was pleasant. The greasy breakfast and strong coffee got even Lyra on her feet, who looked human again after a shower. The atmosphere was relaxed, full of laughter about the previous evening.

""The party's moving to our place!"" Lyra declared as soon as she felt better.

They took a flying taxi to their apartment on the other side of Berlin. There, the fun continued. They drank lighter alcohols, listened to music, and W’thiara, who was experiencing such a casual, human social gathering for the first time, laughed genuinely.

""You people really like to party. To have fun.""

""It's our nature,"" Otto shrugged. ""It's how we are.""

In the evening, still in the same group, they went out for sushi.

""It's raw fish in rice,"" Otto explained to W’thiara as she examined a piece of nigiri with analytical precision. ""Don't worry, it's fully compatible with our physiology. I checked. But the best part is the sake. Japanese vodka. It's weak, you drink it warm.""

W’thiara tasted, played, drank. For her, a being raised by the logical Compact, this day was pure, chaotic relaxation.

And so the days, weeks, and years passed.

Otto's life found a rhythm it had never known. His job as a Guard instructor, while still demanding, became routine. Real life began after hours. His relationship with W’thiara, which had begun with primal, animal magnetism and brutal sex, slowly evolved. The ""monogamy experiment,"" as W’thiara had initially called their exclusivity, unexpectedly became her preferred state. She discovered that the human concept of partnership gave her a sense of stability that her fleeting, instinctive encounters in the Compact barracks had not.

After five years of a monogamous relationship, in 2190, they decided on an Earth wedding. It was more of a gesture by Otto towards the culture he was raised in than a necessity, but W’thiara agreed with analytical curiosity. The ceremony was quiet, just for their closest friends—Lyra, Jimmy, and a few friends from the Guard.

The biggest change, however, was offspring. Otto had wanted those children from the moment he learned they were possible. The Guard and Compact procedures for interspecies reproduction, however, were a bureaucratic nightmare. The matter was at a standstill until Otto, in an act of desperation, asked for help from the one person in the Guard who understood him without words.

Their three children were conceived only after Colonel Kent personally intervened. Kent, with his hero's authority, contacts, and directness, cut through the tangle of regulations and got them the permit. W’thiara carried the eggs, and Otto, with devout reverence, kept them in an incubator for three months, watching as his three young hatched.

Their life became a happy, loud chaos. They ran a home, raised their children, argued about little things, and enjoyed every day together. They didn't know their idyllic life would come to an end. They didn't know that in just over ten years, in 2202, the peace treaty with the Plague would expire.

Some of you may know me. I’m a video game history researcher and the author of several books, including Through the Moongate: The Story of Richard Garriott, Origin Systems Inc. and Ultima and The Sumerian Game: A Digital Resurrection.

I’ve been working for a long time on a book about LucasArts titled Rebels, Pirates and Tentacles: The Story of LucasArts, which is now close to publication via a [Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1108065491/video-games-stage-3-the-story-of-lucasarts?ref=1pwor9).

The book covers the company’s history—from its origins up to 1990—with particular attention to the people who worked there, the creative side of game design, and the technological side, without leaving out any game. In short: it’s not just about the graphic adventures, but about the entirety of LucasArts’ output. BTW, Atari was the reason the Games Group was formed and Atari should have been the publisher of the first games but things went a little south (1983 ;) ) and in the end LucasArts ended publishing with Epyx, Electronic Arts and selfpublishing at the end of the 80s. Anyway, Atari 800, Atari 5200 and 7800 are the first hardware the LucasArts developers worked on so, this could be of interest to you :)

The book is based on meticulous research and numerous original interviews. It’s not a coffee table book, nor a collection of reviews, trivia, or solutions: it’s a history book—detailed, accurate, and packed with information about the company, what was happening in the video game industry during those years, and the influence LucasArts had on the market.

[https://www.andreacontato.com/rebels--pirates-and-tentacles---preview-eng](https://www.andreacontato.com/rebels--pirates-and-tentacles---preview-eng)

I also released a full preview chapter (the formation of the initial team) so everyone can get a sense of how the book is structured and my research and writing style. If you have any questions, I’m at your disposal :) The Kickstarter launched last week and is going pretty well :) We reached the goal in 3 hours and the first two stretch goals in the first day.

I get so dependent on caffeine that i get severe migraine and vomiting if i go cold turkey. Even if i get a week cup of coffee(i normally have 3 per day) i get a headache and nausea. My mood also gets affected, i get really depressed and irritable. If i increase to 4 cups per day, its only a matter of time before i need to increase to 5. Its like with other drugs, you get habituated on the positive effects, but not the side effects, so my stomach starts acting up.

Because caffeine content in coffee is hard to estimate i switch to caffeine tablets when im going to quit. I started with 3 tablets(100mg) every day, for three days. Its uncomfortable, i think im used to three cups of black coffee per day, totalliing somewhere around 350-400mg caffeine. No i am on 100mg and have two days to go! Its not an easy trip though...

* Sleep is terrible, waking up at 0530 feeling withdrawal headache(Falling asleep is quick though)
* Dry eyes
* Depressed mood, easy irritable.

Some of the withdrawal effects go away quickly when i take the next caffeine tablet(dry eyes, bad mood etc) but others(like headache) dont always go away, there seem to be other time cycles involved with that.

This way the withdrawals can be handled at least...

I've been out at my grandparents' place since June (I just like being with them), and I've recently realized how I interact with animals has changed this year. Their neighbors have like seven or eight cows (I forget the exact number). They come up to the fence for me and my mom, and I love petting them if they let me. I tend to try to ask them if I can pet them. I love talking to them like I'd talk to humans (I view them as persons, after all). Their owners keep very bad care of them in the realm of food and grooming, and I talk to the cows about that. As weird as this might sound to my family, I feel as if the cows understand me. We try to feed the cows whatever scraps of fruits and vegetables we have. It's not much, but yeah. I will say, though, that someone in another sub pointed out that this might not be safe for the cows, so I'm going to look into that and talk to my family about that. I had no idea. Anyway, I love making a moo sound, and seeing them all run to the fence.

I used to hate spiders, but now I try to turn a blind eye to the ones I see that aren't venomous. Spiders do still scare me though. There are random insects that get in the house, and I try to catch them and put them outside (Unless they're gnats. They were getting on the food and in the coffee-maker. Also earwigs and scorpions. I don't enjoy killing them, and I feel bad about it, but I'm scared of them and my family hates them, so I feel like I have to. The last time I killed an earwig was months ago, in the early summer, so maybe I won't do that next year.). I like to reassure them that I won't hurt them. I even let what I think was a metallic, greenish-blue colored beetle crawl on my hand. I've released three crickets I think, and just let two others vibe in the house. My grandparents don't really care that they get inside lol. I got a cricket to hop outside of the garage yesterday by moving my foot close to it. I spoke to it and said how I didn't want it to get trapped in the garage.

I talk to the bunny that my mom loves to feed in the front yard at her house, and I want to say that I talked to butterflies and dragonflies, and maybe moths a few months ago near flowers at my grandparents' house. I released what was either a millipede or centipede that somehow got in the house too, and I think I was telling it I wasn't going to hurt it.

Also, for those of you who know what june bugs are, I try to flip them right-side up or put them on grass when I can.

I'm kind of wanting to talk to non-animals as well. Trees, grass, stars, the wind. Storms as well, though they make my arthritis pain worse. I suppose there would be beauty in that, though. Storms make the pain worse, but it is not their fault. I'm from Oklahoma, and thunderstorms are a big part of the weather there, with hail and tornadoes and a lot else.

Amazon and Flipkart are the giants, perfect for numbers and visibility. Shopify does give you freedom but also the bane of doing everything yourself. I once tried to use two platforms simultaneously and ended up juggling stress instead.

But that's when things began to really change for me: I discovered Paxcom. Now, don't eye-roll thinking I'm about to give you another promo shoutout, just hear me out. Paxcom offers something actually valuable: data-driven insights with their analytics tool Kinator. It tells sellers about market trends, competitor pricing, and even what keywords are performing (or bombing spectacularly). I used to go off instinct; Kinator taught me to go off information instead — and my sales charts finally started looking less like a rollercoaster.

Choosing an **e-commerce marketplace** is half the battle; knowing how to win there is where most folks make the error. Paxcom closes that gap by giving brands the visibility and strategy they need without all the bewildering technical techno-jargon. So if you're just starting out, my advice would be this: pick your platform carefully, but make sure you've got smart analytics to fall back on. Believe me, spreadsheets aren't going to be enough on their own; I found that out the hard way (and so did my coffee budget).

==•{Personal Info}•==

**Name:** Ryuuki Jidosha

**Gender:** Unknown At-The-Moment (He/Him)

**Age:** 15-16 (somehow)

**Birthday:** January 20th

**Occupation:** Hero-Student-In-Training, Part-Time Uber Driver and Delivery Person(?)

**Net Worth (Billionaire, Rich, Middle, Lower middle, Poor):** Lower Middle

**Height:** 5 ft 6 in

**Weight:** 1050 kg

**Hair Color:** ?

**Hair type/Haircut:** ?

**Facial Hair/Facial Hair Type:** ?

**Facial Hair Color:** ?

**Eye(?) Color:** Transparent Yellow

**Skin(?) Color:** Orange

**Blood type:** Premium

**Distinguishing Physical Features:** HE'S A CAR

==•{Bio}•==

**Personal Strengths:** Incredibly Durable, Off-Road, part-time 4WD, live-axle rear. He's emotive enough to be treated as somewhat human by a bit of society. Also, thanks to an incident while growing up, he found out he's resistant to a few acids.

**Personal Weaknesses:** Poor highway performance, including a rough ride and a tendency to wander, a cramped interior with limited rear legroom, and low power from its underpowered engine. A bit of an inferiority complex, in which he compares himself to lowly cars.

**Attitude:** Like a radio, his emotions and personality may change in an instant. One second, he's incredibly jovial and friendly; the next, he's beyond furious and impatient. He has difficulties keeping his emotions in check as well as staying patient; he wants to go Go GO! He will stay silent if he's being bullied for being a car; it gets under his skin whenever others say he's ""not human enough"". He sometimes thinks he is who he is because he wants to be seen as an emotional human, not an inanimate car. He sometimes fantasises about being in a ""human"" body with ""normal skin"".

**Likes:** Excessively Sugary Coffee, Premium Oil, Racing, Reincarnation Theory

**Dislikes:** Gas Price Inflation, Parking Tickets, Wheel Locks, 

**Habits:** Daydreams of what he may look like as an ""actual human"". Fiddle with his radio dials, unlocking and locking his doors, revving his engine, and going on a drive when extremely bored or trying to let out some steam.

**Fears:** Of being unable to express himself, of being scrapped for parts, of being experimented on as a living car in a human society. Running out of fuel and falling asleep, slowly rotting and decomposing because he wasn't refuelled, all the while he's asleep

**Reason for becoming a Hero:** He believes that if he wants to be treated as a human, he'll have to be a celebrity. Since heroes are the most famous thing atm, he'll become a hero no matter what to get the recognition and treatment he deserves.

**Relationship with peers/classmates:** Awkward at the moment, they still get confused seeing a ""car"" in a classroom.

**Relationship with Family:** Pretty good, helps his parents get to work before school, as well as dropping off his little sister.

**Relationship Status:** Single

**Backstory (If any):** When he was born, he was thought to be some sort of radio-controlled car, but as his baby cries wailed from the radio, it was quickly known that Ryuuki would face an unexpected life. Around 1 year old, he was able to drive on his own to turn his own wheels, much to the confused delight of his parents. Around 6, he was as big as a Foot-To-Floor Toddler Car toy, delighting his classmates who tried to drive him, much to his and the teacher's shock. Afterwards, he clammed up, kept his doors locked and only allowed them to unlock when his parents asked him to clean. It took a loooooot of time for Ryuuki to be somewhat seen as semi-normal.

  
Around the age of ten, Ryuuki's father decided to open a car workshop to help with his son's body, making him more durable and developing a bit of a pain tolerance. Ryuuki can't really feel the pain of a blow torch or of any part of him falling off, but it still scares him when it happens. Despite that, Ryuuki was able to be more durable as he grew up. Good timing, because as he moved to middle school, the bullying and taunts became more physical. His classmates made moves to try and enter him without his permission, try to go for a joyride and blame him for any cars they crash into. His teachers tried to interfere, but it was getting exhausting for them with how much it occurred, even going so far as to reprimand Ryuuki for aggravating his peers. A startling realisation that they aren't ever going to treat him like a human unless he were a celebrity entered his mind.

Before UA, he trained hard, even getting a driver's license early to drive by himself to race tracks to train his body and wheels. Without proper supervision, he accidentally ran into a villain on the run, and Ryuuki managed to hit them with his body. He was praised for his efforts and, although the crook tried to sue him, he was able to get the villain to pay for the legal troubles he brought upon himself. He was congratulated at school, but even the bullies mostly side-eyed him from afar. This finally ingrained the idea that celebricy means to be praised and seen as a perfect human. Motivated more, he managed to work up the strength to get into UA and learned under his teacher for one year before moving up to 2B.

==•{Quirk Information}•==

* **Quirk Name:** Car
* **Quirk Type:** Mutant
* **Quirk Range:** Self
* **Quirk Description:** Ryuuki appears as an Orange 2001 Jimny Suzuki with white rims. He has the same qualities as an actual Orange 2001 Jimny Suzuki, with the addition of being able to bend and twist his body as if it were rubbery; not even the glass will break when he moves. He can move other parts of his body, such as the wheels, change the radio to speak through it, turn on his headlights, roll down his windows and open his front and back bonnets. He can even manipulate the car seat belts to act as extra limbs to hold or grab things. He's far more durable than a 2001 Jimny Suzuki, as well as a bit faster than an ordinary car. 
* **Miscellaneous Quirk Info:** People have an uncanny valley effect when they look at Ryuuki for too long, since he doesn't look quite like a car yet appears like one. He sees out of his headlights
* **Quirk Strengths:** Really durable, Easy to disguise, incredibly fast, Adapts to different environments easily, and can carry 4-6 passengers
* **Quirk Weaknesses:** Big Body, High maintenance, Limited fuel supply that'll leave him unable to wake up until he's refuelled, Speed makes it hard for him to see or turn, difficulty with braking, when his headlights are on, it becomes hard for him to see, if held on for too long, he'll go temporarily blind.

I have a question regarding bloom time 60 seconds+. I a am aware of Gagne’s findings which Lance Hedrick backs heavily. However for my taste any bloom over 60 seconds (sweetspot 45 se onds for me) heavily mute fruit notes and acidity and kills any transparency of flavors. 
Do you do this long blooms? If so, how your brews look like? Maybe with this long blooms should i go coarser? 

My go-to recipe:
85 clicks on Kingrinder K6 (650-700 microns by honest coffee guide)
1:16 ratio
3 times of coffee bloom for 45 seconds
One pour of 250 grams precisely below breaking point for maximum agitation, small circle
Brewing times 2:00-3:00, based on coffee and pouring technique

When you think about politics and marketing, they might seem worlds apart. But if you look closely, both are about influence, communication, and smart decision-making. Political thinkers built the rules of leadership and governance, while marketers and SEO experts shape how brands reach people today.

In this post, we’ll explore who is known as the father of political science, why strategy matters in both politics and marketing, how tariffs affect business, and how finding the right SEO agency near me can help you grow smarter, not harder.

# Who Is Known as the Father of Political Science?

The title [**father of political science**](https://team4marketers.com/aristotle-father-of-political-science-2025/) is given to Aristotle, a Greek philosopher who lived over 2,000 years ago. He was one of the first people to study politics as a real science — not just an idea or belief.

Aristotle wanted to understand how governments work and what makes them fair or unfair. He compared many city-states of his time and studied how leaders ruled their people. His famous book *Politics* still inspires modern studies of law, leadership, and society.

He believed that politics wasn’t just about power — it was about creating a good life for everyone. That’s why he’s remembered as the father of political science, a thinker who looked beyond kings and empires to focus on people and balance.

# Why Political Thinking Still Matters Today

Aristotle’s ideas on fairness, structure, and responsibility still guide how people think about leadership — even in business.

Just like a ruler must understand citizens, a business must understand its audience. Good decisions come from knowledge, not luck. That’s why marketers, much like political scientists, rely on research, planning, and observation.

Both fields ask the same question: *What do people need, and how can we reach them effectively?*

# The Role of Strategy: From Politics to SEO

In politics, success depends on strategy — when to act, what to say, and how to earn trust. In marketing, it’s the same. You can’t just publish a website and hope people will find it. You need smart planning, timing, and communication.

That’s where SEO (Search Engine Optimization) comes in. When you search online for something like [**SEO agency near me**](https://team4marketers.com/top-rated-seo-agency-near-me/), you’re looking for experts who can make your website more visible to the right audience.

Just as Aristotle studied systems of governance, an SEO expert studies systems of search — algorithms, rankings, and behavior. Both aim to build trust and lasting influence.

# What an SEO Agency Near Me Actually Does

If you’ve ever searched for an SEO agency near me, you’ve probably seen hundreds of options. But what do these agencies really do?

A good SEO agency helps your business appear at the top of Google when customers search for your products or services. They focus on three main areas:

1. **Research:** Finding what people are searching for.
2. **Optimization:** Making your website faster, clearer, and keyword-friendly.
3. **Growth:** Building links, blogs, and brand authority online.

It’s like a digital version of political campaigning — instead of earning votes, you earn clicks and trust.

A skilled SEO team studies online behavior, much like political thinkers studied citizens, to make smart decisions that drive results.

# How Political Science and SEO Overlap

Let’s compare the two to make it simple:

|Political Science|SEO Marketing|
|:-|:-|
|Studies human behavior and society|Studies user behavior and search patterns|
|Aims to build fair and lasting systems|Aims to build lasting online visibility|
|Focuses on power, trust, and influence|Focuses on authority, trust, and ranking|
|Seeks balance and structure|Seeks optimization and performance|

Just like Aristotle wanted governments to be stable and fair, SEO experts want websites to be strong and well-organized. Both rely on knowledge, structure, and long-term thinking.

# Understanding Tariffs and Their Digital Impact

Now, let’s bring in the topic of [**tariffs**](https://team4marketers.com/how-u-s-tariffs-in-2025-are-shaking-the-global-economy/) — a key concept from economics and political science that also affects marketing today.

A *tariff* is a tax placed on goods when they move between countries. Governments use tariffs to protect local industries or to earn revenue. For example, if a country imports foreign cars, it might add a tariff so local carmakers stay competitive.

So how do tariffs connect to modern business and SEO?

* **Pricing strategies:** When tariffs increase, companies raise prices, and SEO teams must adjust online campaigns to reflect new costs.
* **Search trends:** Customers start searching for cheaper or local alternatives, which changes keyword trends.
* **Global marketing:** Businesses must localize their websites for different regions and regulations.

In short, tariffs affect how products are sold, priced, and even marketed — both offline and online.

# Lessons From Aristotle for Modern Marketers

Aristotle taught that every system needs structure and purpose. The same idea applies to digital marketing. A good SEO plan doesn’t happen by chance — it follows clear logic.

Here’s what marketers can learn from the father of political science:

* **Study behavior deeply.** Just like Aristotle studied people, study your customers.
* **Seek balance.** Don’t focus only on traffic — focus on engagement and trust.
* **Lead with ethics.** Be transparent in advertising and data use.
* **Build long-term influence.** Quick wins don’t last; strategy does.

These ideas connect ancient political wisdom with modern digital success.

# Why Local SEO Matters Today

If you own a business, being found locally is crucial. That’s why so many people search for SEO agency near me — they want nearby experts who understand their market.

Local SEO focuses on showing your business to customers in your area. For example, if someone in Pune searches “best coffee shop near me,” Google shows results from Pune, not Delhi.

A good SEO agency helps you appear in local maps, search results, and business listings. They optimize your content with local keywords, reviews, and consistent contact details.

Just like local leaders understand their communities, local SEO helps businesses connect with the right people close to them.

# How Tariffs Influence Online Markets

Tariffs might sound like something only governments deal with, but they also affect how people buy and search online.

For example, if tariffs make imported electronics more expensive, customers might search for “affordable smartphones near me” or “local laptop deals.” That’s a signal for SEO agencies to target new keywords and update website content.

When global trade changes, search behavior changes too — and smart marketers adjust their SEO strategies fast.

This is where experience matters. A skilled SEO agency watches these shifts closely, much like economists watch markets or political scientists study policy changes.

# How to Choose the Right SEO Partner

If you’re planning to work with an SEO expert, here’s what to look for:

1. **Experience and transparency.** Ask what strategies they use.
2. **Customized plans.** Each business is unique — one strategy doesn’t fit all.
3. **Local understanding.** If you’re searching “SEO agency near me,” make sure they actually know your area and market.
4. **Regular updates.** SEO is not a one-time job; it needs ongoing effort.
5. **Clear results.** They should track rankings, traffic, and leads for you.

Just as a good leader wins trust through actions, a good SEO agency wins loyalty through honest results.

# The Connection Between Policy and Marketing

Political decisions, like tariffs or trade agreements, can change entire industries. Similarly, SEO algorithms — Google’s “rules” — can change how websites rank overnight.

In both cases, strategy and adaptability are key.

* Governments adjust laws to stay fair.
* Businesses adjust websites to stay visible.

Both require observation, analysis, and planning — skills taught by the father of political science and practiced daily by SEO experts.

# Final Thoughts: Ancient Wisdom, Modern Growth

From Aristotle’s ancient studies to modern digital marketing, the lessons are timeless — understand people, build trust, and plan for the long term.

The  [**father of political science**](https://team4marketers.com/aristotle-father-of-political-science-2025/) helped the world see how systems of power and governance work. Today, SEO experts do something similar — they study how digital systems work to help brands reach people.

When global markets change because of [**tariffs**](https://team4marketers.com/how-u-s-tariffs-in-2025-are-shaking-the-global-economy/), or when you search for an [**SEO agency near me**](https://team4marketers.com/top-rated-seo-agency-near-me/), remember that both politics and marketing share the same foundation: strategy, structure, and human understanding.

At Team4Marketers, we believe success comes from learning — from the past and the present. Whether it’s Aristotle’s philosophy or a smart SEO plan, the goal is the same: make ideas visible and valuable in a connected world.",1,1762512021.0,u_Historical_Royal_593,0,1.0,False

1oqr2ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1oqr2ev/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

Yesterday I received my first grinder, Kingrinder P2.

Looking at the grind chart I decided to grind at 40 clicks for the first time. I did and the coffee was really good but a bit bitter. I was thinking of making it a bit coarser next time.  
But then I realized I was counting wrong. I was thinking that half a cycle was 30 clicks, where in reality a full cycle is 30 clicks. That means that the grinding I did that first day was in reality 25 clicks (half cycle + 10 clicks)

So today I counted correctly and grinded at 45 clicks (much coarser than before)  
Now of course we would expect a totally different cup and it actually was,  
but the weird thing is that it was much more bitter. I would expect it to be more sour or watery.

Every other variable was the same.  
So? What's going on?  
What should I try next?",2,1762511904.0,mokapot,11,1.0,False

At Matha, what fills those walls is a way of life - quiet, disciplined, and deeply human.

When patients arrive at our Kudappanakunnu unit, most expect a typical Ayurvedic hospital - treatments, medicines, and routines. But a few days in, they begin to notice something different: silence in the corridors, the absence of TV screens, a sense of calm that grows with every sunrise.

🕊️ Culture Begins at the Door
Every day here starts with something as simple as leaving your footwear outside - a small act that signals entry into a space of humility. Inside, mornings begin with a gentle prayer - not as ritual, but as a shared moment of gratitude before the day’s healing begins.

🍃 Living With Intention
There are no televisions, Wi-Fi, or newspapers. For many, that feels unusual at first. But with time, this disconnection becomes an invitation - to rest your eyes, to listen to yourself, to heal without distraction. Even reading and mobile use are minimized to protect eye health. This rhythm of quiet living becomes the invisible framework that supports recovery.

Meals are another reflection of this culture - simple, fresh vegetarian food served with care, and a small gesture of self-service after each meal: washing one’s own plate. It’s not an obligation; it’s an act of participation, a reminder that healing is a partnership between doctor and patient.

🌄 The Matha Discipline
Patients sleep early, rise with the first light, and start the day with a warm herbal drink instead of coffee or tea. Conversations are kept brief and kind. Every action - from feedback sharing to doctor visits - is done with awareness. These routines are not restrictions; they are quiet instruments of precision care.

As our chief physician often says, “These small acts of discipline form the invisible structure behind every successful treatment.”

🔍 For Those Wondering About Matha Ayurveda Eye Hospital Reviews

Many who share their experiences speak not just about their improvement in vision, but about how the atmosphere itself became part of their healing. The culture here isn’t designed for comfort - it’s designed for clarity, both of vision and of mind.

Have you ever found that discipline or silence changed your recovery experience?

I’ve been playing around with different pour-over water recipes using Apex Minerals, and I’m curious what others have found works best.

I mostly brew clean and delicate washed coffees, and I’m trying to find a water composition that really lets these coffee shine.

Would love to hear what ppm ranges or mineral balances you’ve found to be most consistent or revealing for this kind of profile.

Also are you adding the minerals before brewing, or right into the brewed coffee?

I’ve always been a total coffee addict , like 4–5 cups a day minimum. It’s my comfort, my energy, my “I can function now” ritual 😂 But now that I’ve started GLP-1 (about a week in, through shemed), I’m a little worried my caffeine habit might be messing with how the meds work.

I’m still dealing with the usual early side effects , a bit of nausea, not super hungry, kinda tired , but the one thing I *cannot* seem to cut back on is coffee 😬

I read somewhere that caffeine can mess with appetite and blood sugar levels, and now I’m wondering: could it affect how GLP-1 does its thing? Like, does too much coffee make it less effective or make the side effects worse?

I tried switching one cup to decaf, but let’s be real, it’s just not the same 😅 I have an emotional bond with my morning brew at this point.

So now I’m torn. Should I try to cut back, or is it fine as long as I stay hydrated and don’t overdo it?

Anyone else here a caffeine junkie on GLP-1? Did you notice any difference when you changed your coffee intake?  
Would love to hear how others handled it ,  trying to figure out if I need to chill on my caffeine or if I’m just overthinking this ☕🤷‍♀️

I feel like I could handle one or the other but flipping back and forth is absolutely miserable and I feel like SHIT. Hopefully the weeks I do two nights in a row is a little bit easier on me since the second night is always a little easier and I can usually fall right to sleep once I get off (after working two nights, unlike this last one I did)…

I do work remote so at least that’s a bonus. But I’m old and my body does not like this at all!!!!

Anyway. Sleep tight everyone getting off now, sweet dreams! See ya in a week when I’m back to nights for a minute. I love you guys!!! Nightshifters are the best people xoxoxo ",2,1762511234.0,Nightshift,9,1.0,False
