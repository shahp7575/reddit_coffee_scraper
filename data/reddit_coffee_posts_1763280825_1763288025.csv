1oyi1zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oyi1zc/where_do_i_find_the_best_piccolo_cups_glasses/,Where do I find the best piccolo cups/ glasses,"Hey everyone, 

I’m starting my Christmas shopping and for my dad I’m thinking I would love to get him some piccolo glasses. I don’t drink coffee so I have absolutely no idea where to start. 

He went to Italy and came back obsessed and now orders piccolos everywhere and has an obsession with researching best coffee beans ect… 

I am wondering where I can buy really beautiful cups or glasses - I’m not sure if a cup or glass is better, maybe even ceramic? 

I never really do nice or personal gifts for him so I’m willing to spend a bit more than usual. 

I feel like this should most definitely cover the cost. My budget is around [$150 AUD] 

I think it would be kind of cool to get them from Italy or find some from a small company/ handmade - because of this I’m happy to spend more. I really don’t want to go for big companies that lack in quality. 

Anyway thanks so much!!! I appreciate any and all advice :) ",1,1763287625.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Figured the world needed a dead simple cheat sheet that does not try to upsell you to Patagonia.

So I told MGX to give me Nat Geo vibes but for a broke college student. It spit out 4 clean layouts in race mode, and I picked the one that looked like it drinks instant coffee. Dropped in my own words, swapped the hero image for a pic I snapped last summer, and boom, it suddenly looked like a real outdoors brand.

Posted the link in two facebook hiking groups and things got weird. A gear shop slid into my dms asking to list their beginner class. Two micro guides offered cash for a feature spot. Some dude wants me to clone the site for his local club. I literally built it on a saturday in my pajamas.

Now I'm adding a trail difficulty calculator and a gear checklist because why not. Still zero stress, still no code.

U poslednjih godinu dana je tamo počela da radi farmaceutkinja iz komšiluka. Ne poznajem je lično niti ona mene van apoteke.

U apoteci je oduvek bila izuzetno ljubazna i profesionalna. Uvek je nasmejana i odmah me s vrata poziva na njen pult. Kada nema neki lek, detaljno pogleda u bazi gde ga ima, uputi me tamo i uvek ih pozove telefonom da rezerviše lek za mene.

Sve ovo sam pripisivao profesionalnoj ljubaznosti. Međutim, skoro je počela da mi se javlja u prolazu. Ne samo standardno ""ćao"" već sa entuzijazmom i osmehom. Kao da je presrećna što me vidi. Pre neki dan sam stajao na trotoaru, gledao u mobilni telefon i bio joj praktično okrenut leđima. Prepoznala me je i javila mi se.

Devojka me poznaje samo iz apoteke kao nekoga ko diže lekove. Ne verujem da pozdravlja baš sve mušterije koje sretne na ulici. Na ulici nisam ""mušterija"" tako da mislim da se obraća meni lično.

***Ako*** sam joj se i svideo, mogu da nagađam zašto. Uvek sam pristojan, trudim se da budem efikasan da ne gušim red. Odmah joj predam kartice za lekove na recept. Za one bez recepta isečem deo kutije gde se jasno vidi ime leka. Ako neke lekove s recepta ne želim, napišem to pregledno na papir da ne mora da pamti.

Nakon dosta analiziranja postalo mi je jasno da je ""ćao"" u prolazu verovatno maksimum koji ona može da uradi. Ne može me pitati za broj, pozvati na kafu ili započeti razgovor iz čista mira. Može samo staviti do znanja da me je primetila a sve ostalo je na meni.

Problem je što ni ja ne mogu mnogo. Ovde imamo ""ćao-ćao"" kulturu, ne zaustavljamo ljude koje površno znamo na ulici da bismo ćaskali. Ne znam ništa o njoj (gde izlazi, hobiji) a na društvenim mrežama je nisam našao.

Ono što mi je AI predložio da uradim a da ne kršim previše društvene norme jeste da joj sledeći put uz zdravstvene kartice pružim i malu ceduljicu. Da je pogledam u oči, kažem ""ovo je za tebe"" i normalno nastavim sa preuzimanjem lekova.

>This might be a little strange, but you are always exceptionally kind when I pick up medication for my parents, and it brightens my day. I'd love to take you for a coffee, to thank you properly. [Name] [Number]"" 

(naravno ne bih to napisao na engleskom)

Postoji izreka da pravoj osobi ne možeš reći ništa pogrešno. Verujem da li je nešto ""creepy"" zavisi isključivo od toga da li se toj osobi dopadaš ili ne.

Šta mislite o celoj situaciji i ovom planu sa ceduljicom. Da li je to simpatičan pristup ili je ipak previše? Imate li neki bolji predlog?

1oyhrpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ARK/comments/1oyhrpy/my_tlc_ideas_wishlist/,My TLC ideas / wishlist,"Giganotosaurus:

- Is able turn on the spot

- Some kind of tail attack so it can attack from all angles

- More stamina regen + less stam drain

- Quieter footsteps

- Reworked rage mechanic: The Giga’s rage mode would let it take 50% reduced damage through adrenaline, becomes immune to stuns, and it no longer throws you off it’s back.

- Roar ability
The Giga’s roar now disables mate boost. I don’t think the roar should have a major ability so I think something like this would suffice.

Araneo:


- Better movement

The Araneo recieves strafing, Megalania adjascent wall climbing, and a chargable jump. The araneo also no longer recieves fall damage.

- Better webs

The Araneo’s webs now work just like a bola, and you can delay firing the webs for as ling as you are holding the fire button. Victims are completely incapacitated for 20 seconds

Web ziplines

- The araneo can create temporary zip lines that it, and anybody in it’s tribe can use until the zipline decays.

- Better stats

This one is obvious. I would give the araneo similar stats to a deinonychus, and much, MUCH less stamina drain.


Megalosaurus:

- Coffee

The Megalosaurus saddle now has a craftable coffee consumable that you can feed to your Megalo to make it active during daytime for 15 minutes before it goes back to sleep. This coffee can also be fed to cryo sick dinosaurs to help them wake up.

I would give the Megalo the ability to let you use weapons while riding it also.

- benefits to sleeping

When it is sleeping, the Megalo regenerates HP extremely fast, up to 40% before it starts regenerating normally and doesn’t consume as much food when it sleeps.


Quetzal:

-Different saddle dynamics

The Quetzal irl was an upright animal so I think it would be cool if it was upright if equipped with it’s normal saddle, and slouched down with it’s platform saddle equipped. Quetzals with the normal saddle equipped now let you use weapons while riding them.

-More carrying options

Just like the Argy, the Quetz should be able to carry creatures in it’s beak. It can either carry small creatures, or swallow them whole for an HP and stamina regeneration buff. Quetzals will be unable to swallow survivors and will instead choke on them for balancing reasons.

i 24f have been with my boyfriend 26m for three years. my best friend since high school ""maya"" 24f has been part of my life for almost ten years.

maya and my boyfriend always got along. i thought it was great that my best friend and my partner were friends. they had similar music taste, both into the same video games, whatever. i never thought anything of it.

last night i was at mayas apartment. she was in the shower and her phone kept buzzing on the coffee table. i wasnt trying to snoop but i saw my boyfriends name pop up with ""cant wait to see you tomorrow.""

i thought maybe they were planning a surprise for me or something. her phone unlocked with face id when i picked it up and i saw the messages.

months of messages. explicit messages. pictures. plans to meet up when i was at work. him calling her baby. her sending him shit like ""i feel bad but i cant stop.""

i scrolled back. it started six months ago.

maya came out of the shower and saw me with her phone. she froze. i asked her what the fuck this was.

she started crying immediately and said it just happened and she didnt mean for it to happen and she tried to stop but they have a connection.

i left. went straight to my boyfriends place. he wasnt there. i texted him ""i know about maya"" and he called me two minutes later.

he said it was a mistake. that it didnt mean anything. that he loves me and it was just physical with her.

i asked how long. he said a few months. i said i saw the messages, i know its been six months. he got quiet and then said fine, six months, but hes been wanting to end it and didnt know how.

i hung up. blocked both of them.

my phone has been blowing up all morning. maya keeps calling from different numbers saying we need to talk. my boyfriend showed up at my apartment this morning and i didnt answer the door.

mutual friends are texting me asking whats going on. apparently maya is telling people i ""misunderstood"" what i saw.

i didnt misunderstand shit. i saw months of my best friend fucking my boyfriend while pretending to be my friend to my face.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Notre Dame vs. Ohio State: A Tale of Sieves, Snowstorms, and Sudden Death**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans—or, more accurately, a clash of a titan (Ohio State) and a team that’s still figuring out how to be a titan (Notre Dame). The Fighting Irish, fresh off a **93-54 loss to Michigan** that made their defense look like a sieve at a bakery, now trek to Columbus to face a Buckeyes squad that’s 3-0 and oddly confident despite ranking 225th in defense last season. Let’s break this down with the precision of a coach’s whiteboard and the humor of a halftime rant.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Ohio State is the Favorite (and Why You Shouldn’t Bet Against Them)

The numbers don’t lie, and right now, they’re wearing a “BET ON OSU” T-shirt. Ohio State is favored by **7-8.5 points** across most books, with moneyline odds implying a **79-81% chance of victory** (thanks to their -800 lines). Notre Dame’s +420 odds mean bookmakers give them a **19-21% shot**, which is about the same chance of me napping through a hurricane and waking up to find my coffee still hot.

The spread tells a story: Ohio State’s offensive firepower (78.8 PPG last season) meets Notre Dame’s porous defense (72.5 PAPG allowed). It’s like pairing a chainsaw with a bowl of Jell-O—inevitable carnage. The over/under of **152.5 points**? A generous buffet for two teams that combined to drop 147 points in Notre Dame’s last game. Buckle up; this could get messy.

### News.digest(): Injuries, Comebacks, and Why Notre Dame’s “Comeback” Was a Mirage

Notre Dame’s recent loss to Michigan wasn’t just a defeat—it was a masterclass in humility. The Irish mounted an 8-0 run to cut a 24-point deficit to 16, which is as impressive as me finally finishing a Sudoku puzzle. But Michigan closed the game with a 38-15 onslaught, leaving Notre Dame’s defense looking like a deflated balloon at a party.

Key man to watch: **Markus Burton**, who dropped 21 on Eastern Illinois. Can he replicate that magic against Ohio State’s 2024 stats (19.6 foul

*By Your Favorite Sports Oracle (Also a Part-Time Stand-Up Comedian)*

---

**Parse the Odds: The Math of Mayhem**  
The Houston Cougars, ranked No. 1 and favored by 6.5 points, are the defensive equivalent of a vault guarded by a sleep-deprived dragon. Last season, they allowed a measly 58.7 points per game—the best defense in college basketball. Meanwhile, Auburn’s offense is a pyrotechnics show, averaging 83 points per game last year (13th nationally), but their defense is… well, let’s say it’s a sieve that’s applied for a job as a coffee filter.

Houston’s offense, however, is about as thrilling as a tax audit—73.7 points per game (182nd in the country), but their three-point shooting is precise: 39.4% accuracy (4th-best). Auburn, conversely, hucks 9.0 threes per game (60th) but connects at a 35.9% clip (72nd)—like a team that bought a lottery ticket and *somehow* won… every single time.

Implied probabilities? Houston’s moneyline odds (decimal: 1.31) suggest a 76.3% chance to win. Auburn’s (3.55) imply 28.2%. Add in the vig, and it’s a lopsided love affair. The over/under of 139.5 points? A middle ground between Houston’s frugal scoring and Auburn’s fireworks.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Kent State vs. Wright State: A Clash of Clumsy Three-Pointers and Home-Court Hype**

The Kent State Golden Flashes (-3.5 to -4.5) and Wright State Raiders (81.4 PPG at home) are set for a showdown at Colonial Hall, where the air is thick with the scent of overpriced popcorn and questionable three-point shooting. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-infused energy drinks.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

**Kent State** enters as the slight favorite, with implied probabilities hovering around **65%** based on decimal odds (1.48 at FanDuel). Their defense, ranked **61st nationally** (allowing 68.3 PPG), is the NBA’s version of a “good” first date—reliable but not exciting. However, their offense is a sieve, ranking **233rd in three-pointers made** (7.2 per game) and **294th in 3PT%** (31.9%). Imagine trying to win a basketball game while your team’s perimeter shooting resembles a blindfolded toddler throwing darts at a basket. Not ideal.

**Wright State**, meanwhile, is the definition of “high-risk, high-reward.” Their offense is a well-oiled machine, ranking **82nd nationally** (77.3 PPG), with a three-point attack that’s **13th-best in the country** (38.4%). At home, they’re even more lethal, averaging **81.4 PPG**—which is like bringing a flamethrower to a water pistol fight. But their defense? A tragic comedy. Allowing **76.4 PPG** (301st) means they’re the team that lets the other side score as if they’re playing *NBA 2K* on “All-Star” difficulty.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Heroics, and Shoelaces

1oyhhqu,https://i.redd.it/kwmeuuf79l1g1.jpeg,23 Days,"In 2018 I quit smoking, and I was free for two years and loving every minute of it. 

For some reason, in the fall of 2020 I was walking around the city late at night and I just wanted to have a smoke. Call it stress, or loneliness, or anything else. 

I bought a pack and a lighter, and stepped out onto the curb at one in the morning watching the drinks stagger down the street and lit up that little cylindrical sonofabitch for the first time in two years. 

I was disgusted, the smell, the taste, the rush of chemicals to my body. I took a few drags and stubbed it out, thinking this was something I no longer did…

But I didn’t throw away the pack. I’d paid for it after all, maybe I’d give it to a smoker or someone else later.

The next morning, I made my coffee and went outside, and with almost zero hesitation, lit one back up. 

Two years of freedom gone. Since then, I’ve thought about quitting, and tried quitting, but because of that incident, my brain decided that I was incapable of doing it for real…

I vaped because I thought it was better and then ultimately smoked and vaped, which was ten times worse. Any quit attempt I made in the last five years only lasted a few days…

But today, today I’m 23 days in! 23 days free! And I remember how easy this can be. The first night I quit, I went to an art exhibition and hung out with a ton of smokers, even held a cigarette in my hand for the better part of 20 minutes, but I didn’t light it. 

I didn’t have withdrawals, I didn’t feel like I was fighting for my life, I just felt like I was free again, that feeling was so amazing. 

Every day, I look at this dumb little counter and smile, and remember that the time is gonna pass no matter what I do, so I might as well do the best thing for my life.

If you haven’t quit yet, or you relapsed, or you’re just thinking of how to help a friend that’s a smoker, I recommend Allen Carr’s Easyway to quit smoking. 

That book saved me twice.

1oyhgt1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/1oyhgt1/sonder_hotels_failed_because/,Sonder hotels failed because…,"**Sonder failed because…** 

… because hotels are a wheel that did not need a tech remaking. 

A shocking ending for an unsurprising company. Forgive me.. the words were mixed up: An unsurprising ending for a shocking company. 

On the outside Sonder appeared exciting. A hotel meets Airbnb meets apartment meets Silicon Valley tech combination.  It essentially was just a retool of the Airbnb model except instead of individual owned houses/apartments, sonder utilized apartment/hotel buildings. But more on that later. 

Sonder failed for many reasons and let’s start from the top:

**Francis**. The one time ceo and co-founder of the company. A ghostly figure on company slack channels. When the company would host its all hands video calls and he would enter the screen.. in what was probably the darkest most depressing corner of Pharrell’s mansion that he bought during better times.. the more he spoke the more a few things became clear: he didn’t really know much about the business he was running.. when employees would ask questions he didn’t have the answers.. he lacked confidence/ knowledge and ownership in business topics, and mostly he just deferred to other senior staff to lead the calls. Perhaps that’s a perk of being a founder.. you can just sit back and let others lead, when in any other company you would not be qualified to hold that position. 

When the Marriott deal was announced and he announced his departure  that was one of the biggest red flags. Why leave when a tremendous deal occurred. Would Marriott not want him as a consultant or point person to lead. If not ceo then why not remain on the board as chairman or member. It’s as if he saw the writing on the wall and left before the collapse that would place the blame on him. This was no titanic story, he as captain did not go down with the ship. He jumped on a lifeboat to safety miles before the iceberg showed up. 

 How much did he really know or didn’t know is anyone’s guess but when you’re the leader the buck stops with you.. the standards and foundations you set are what the company grows from. Clearly the foundation was shaky and settling to the point that cracks formed and later resulted in instability and catastrophic failure. 

**The concept**. 

Sonder failed because the hotel industry is a very well understood concept that does not need changing. Sure design, amenities, and locale will differ but the standard idea of : rent a room, check in, stay, leave.. are uniform throughout the industry. Sonder removed that by developing a hands off pre verification approach.  Guests would verify offsite via a multi step online application and upon approval, use codes to enter buildings and spaces. It was marketed towards younger travelers who perhaps were less interested in traditional doormen/bellman/front desks/concierge and all the other familiar faces once would see at a hotel. They also at least initially had the tech understanding to complete the pre arrival process. The problem? It alienates everybody else. Another problem.. the startup mentality does not translate to the tradition that is hotel lodging. 

**The Realestate**:

One of Sonder’s biggest mistakes was not owning any of their properties. They were not franchisees. Each property was an individual signed lease, no different than renting an apartment. Just more expensive. They were at the mercy of landlords in a high stakes game of monopoly. In the name of growth and greed sonder signed lease after lease at times over a dozen per city. It begs to question what was the real estate team thinking.. perhaps they were more concerned with bonuses and commissions rather than analyzing long term stability of the properties. When you work with landlords you are at their mercy. And in what world do landlords every agree to a reduction in rent? So when you stop paying rent, the landlords can kick you out of the building. Which many did. And when your buildings due to size and popularity are financial lifelines for a city.. there will only be collapse. 

**Bad money management** 

Perhaps one of the most prominent mistakes was taking a hotel company public in the middle of a global pandemic. The hotel industry shut down during Covid. Why would a hospitality company go public in the middle of a worldwide crisis that shut down travel and hotels? What did you think would happen to the stock price?

Moving on. Sonder spaces were beautiful. If you look at the photos online. Lots of money was spent on these spaces. Many of the pieces catalogued and/or an early partnership with West Elm resulted in the spaces having this clean modern look. 

In the early years of sonder the company was very much so a startup culture. Company outings. Swag for employees.  Snacks. Sending employees to different Sonder cities. Money was being made and money was being spent. 

Housekeeping was not in-house. It was typically a third party company. Another financial constraint. If you’re paying $60 per clean to a third party company but charging $120 a night that leaves $60 for: salaries, rent payments, utility bills, supply ordering, insert here, insert here, insert here expenses. The math does not add up to anything except being greatly in the red. 

Customer service was outsourced to the Philippines. Whenever you call/ text/ email/ send a chat you are 7/10 times speaking with them.. however if you were lucky , you would encounter a city staff member on text/chat /email assuming they had the time to answer those reachouts. 

Leaders.. more on that below 

**Staffing** 

Back to the idea of start up culture and traditional hospitality:, tech people focus on tech things, while hospitality people focus on hospitality. A tech person knows nothing of customer service in the way that a hospitality person does and vice versa. To enter the hotel industry with a tech mindset is a disaster because the most important factor is overlooked: the customer. 

Which leads us to staffing. Sonder tended to hire non hospitality people to run their cities. Perhaps even corporate levels. If the leaders of the city do not come from hotels, but from a tech etc..background, what do they know about providing good hospitality and customer service to hotel guests? If top leadership does not come from the hotel industry what do they know about leading a hotel company? No matter how Sonder painted itself at the end of the day it was a hotel. The people in charge should come from that background. 

This lead to catastrophe for the guests. Managers who were more concerned with numbers instead of the guest experience. Managers who actively delayed and ignored solving guest issues and having face to face discussions with customers and their employees.  Managers who knew nothing of maintaining the properties they were tasked with running. Failures of building and unit upkeep which no one took control of and yet everyone else was blamed. 

Perhaps this failure of city leadership stems from the fact that Sonder did not offer traditional HR.. the HR of Sonder was an unknown entity that employees submit an online form to get answers. There was no onsite HR representation in the cities… No one the employees could go to for help or to share concerns in person… hourly employees did not know who their city assigned HR representative was. They would only submit this online form and get an answer later.  Usually for a different person each time. 

By not having a corporate hr rep in each city keeping track and maintaining oversight it allowed management teams in the city to close ranks and run their own ecosystems based on their own preferences and rules.  As a result equal treatment was not distributed amongst employees. Especially if you weren’t a favorite. Special consideration while never outright admitted, was given to those with family members and relationships on-site. Nepotism existed, convenient hirings/promotions  existed. There’s only so much an employee can do if you are not favored/dating someone important/related to someone important if you wanted to grow your within your individual sonder city. 

This lack of oversight and professionalism was astounding. The only potential oversight was in the form of an every so often “anonymous” peakon survey where employees could share honest opinions. Except they weren’t anonymous. Every employee was assigned  under a supervisor/manager. If there were not enough employees assigned under a supervisor, it was very easy for that leader to then figure out who said what about them.  Promises of change always would come with these surveys but no changes would occur. 

Hourly employees wished corporate would swoop in and take control or send HR to interview and clean things up.. but neither occurred. 

Leaders maintained unrealistic expectations on their hourly staff. They gaslit them. Roles were not clearly defined. Even roles publicly listed online were flexible and often times a singular hourly staff member would take on the responsibilities of 2-3 jobs. Managers of course were always conveniently too busy spending hours a day closed off in “meetings”. Meetings to get coffee together. Meetings to get lunch together. And actual meetings. No desk presence from managers. No manager presence when guest conflicts arose. Managers treated the job like a 9-5. Many lit the door by 5pm. Except the problem with that is hotels are 24 hour operations. Naturally all problems and conflict sometimes dangerous conflict resolution fell to hourly staff after hours. . What sonder failed to realize is the most important person is the guest. They are not just a number on a balance sheet. They are a real human being spending real money to stay. They should always have been the first and main priority. The next greatest priority is the hourly staff. Train them, support them, uplift them and you will see success. That did not cure here and anyone can look at the reviews on Glassdoor and other review sites to see how Sonder leaders ran their teams. 

Annual raises and merit raises. Rare and minimal. Some received 30 cents. Some 50 cents. Employees typically receive a raise at the beginning of the year. Managers received their cash bonus. Hourly employees received their cents half a year later. It’s wildly disgusting how Sonder treated its hourly staff in person and on the backend. 

**Guest experience** 

Sonder was a hotbed for prostitution. The concept was perfect… barely present staff especially in buildings with no front desk… Apartment style accommodations… And codes to enter.. prostitutes and their clients were a common feature at Sonders. The girls were typically international, from central/South America  and traveled in groups renting for a week or two at a time. Occasionally they had a “pimp” with them typically in the form of a boyfriend. Clients would come and go using their codes.  

Underage guests were also an issue. Sonder was originally a Canadian company. The age to rent a space was 18 and up. As you can imagine that can result in problematic stays. Out of control parties. 18 year olds bringing in younger people to their rooms. Sonder should have been a 21+ hotel company. 

Drug use was rampant in the rooms. Weed was a common smell. 

Bedbugs. Or in Sonder terminology “jellybeans” were an unfortunate reality as well.  Though this is not Sonder specific.. but was of course another added cost to remedy. 

Homeless/ mentally ill visitors. Sonder properties were in central locations in major cities. Often times in neighborhoods with nightlife and heavy foot traffic. This brought growing numbers of homeless individuals around building entrances and even at times within the building itself.. leaving you guessed it.. hourly staff to handle removal if security was not on-site and managers were already home.  

The rooms were overused and poorly maintained. They photograph beautifully but when you look more closely the age and overuse shows. This could be helped with proper maintenance but like the prior leadership mentions, the property management team was also ill equipped or wrongly hired to perform the job. So eventually the units and buildings fell into disarray. 

**Marriott**

Marriott. What did they know? When the deal was announced Marriott had 1.5 million rooms on offer. Sonder had under 10,000. What kind of partnership could this have been. What say did Sonder have to anything. 

The only benefit sonder employees had was the ability to stay 5 times a year up to 3 days at a time for $50 or the cleaning fee at sonder properties. This was taken away upon Marriott taking over. The Marriott employee travel system is a lie. The promise of discount rates at all Marriott brands yet they never exist when searching for them. How do you go from letting your employees stay for 3 days for $50 to paying $80-300 per night depending on the brand but having that discount never appear as available when searching. 

Did Marriott do their due diligence before entering this arrangement?  Or do they just gobble up as much as they can to maintain dominance.

it was amazing learning how fraudulent the Bonvoy system is. so often you would get platinum/titanium guests that had no money and who’s stays were unpaid. Many times never showing up. Do bonvoy members get status growth by just booking and not staying? Or booking and not paying? Do they book list to hold a room and never use it? Are they ploys to get credits and points? 

Often these were Marriott employees or friends of Marriott employees that builtup their status. Does Marriott not audit or keep track of their members? Is it not odd that you have employees or friends of employees at platinum/titanium level.. when do they have time to travel 50/75 nights a year and still be employed full time to obtain/maintain  that status. When Sonder went live in May countless Marriott employees stayed whose credit cards later failed. As if they knew to take advantage of the system. 

 You could always tell when a “real” Marriott bonvoy was staying. It was clear they legitimately earned their status. The prostitutes surprisingly or unsurprisingly enough were high level bonvoy members. Probably due to their frequent travel.  Though some stayed under employee rates which was confusing. 

Speaking of. How could Marriott push Sonder to their Bonvoy elites knowing that Sonder is not a traditional hotel model. Marriott guests familiar with and expecting a certain hotel experience were left with being locked out of buildings .. confused by or unwilling to verify online, and unimpressed with the rooms and amenity offerings. The only Bonvoy elites that’s seemed to mesh with the Sonder model were business travelers who enjoyed the apartment style having a kitchen/laundry in the space to use rather than just a bed like typical hotels. Marriott set their most loyal customers up for failure by not clearly and loudly advising exactly what Sonder was and wasn’t.

So what was the endgame for Marriott. Did they go in knowing Sonder was going to fail. 

Did they do this to be able to claim a big fat tax write off at the end of the year. Did they legitimately try to grow/ let the brand prosper. 

Sonder almost got delisted from Nasdaq multiple times. Its financial issues and mass layoffs were not new information. All of this was public knowledge. Did Marriott enter not knowing this or did they not care Anyone’s guess. 

And how it ended. For such a behemoth of a company that drills the importance of its bonvoy service onto staff.. to then throw their most loyal out on the streets with no answers, not relocating or rebooking them price matched to the dozens of affiliate properties it has per city is catastrophic. Marriott removed financial and booking control from Sonder. All payments went through Marriotts Opera software system and stripe. it’s crazy how Sonder, a blip sizewise when it comes to Marriott has now resulted in Marriott facing major negative brand PR and loss of trust amongst its most loyal",4,1763285443.0,sanfrancisco,3,0.83,False

The tires hum against asphalt, a steady drone that should calm me, but instead my heart just beats harder the closer I get to The Ridge. The trees crowd the road, branches knitting together overhead like fingers trying to keep me from turning back.

I should’ve stayed away.  
I *promised* I would stay away.

But the dead don’t care about promises.

Elias’s face flashes in my mind—bright, stupidly hopeful, always a little sunburnt. I shake it away. Thinking about him too long has a way of pulling the air out of my lungs.

The cabin comes into view through the trees, hunched and familiar as a bad memory. The roof still sags a little on the left side. The porch still creaks when the wind hits it. Nothing has changed, and somehow that hurts more than if everything had.

I pull into the gravel drive, the crunch echoing like a gunshot. My hands stay glued to the wheel long after the engine stops.

I shouldn’t be here.  
But I don’t have anywhere else left.

When I finally force the car door open, cold air slaps my face. The mountains smell the same—pine, dirt, and something metallic hidden beneath it, the scent that always meant winter was coming.

A soft wind pushes past me and carries a sound I’m not prepared for:

A hum.

Low. 

Familiar. 

Threaded through the trees like a memory trying too hard to breathe.

My chest tightens.

It can’t be him.

It *can’t.*

But the melody—God, it’s the melody we made up when we were thirteen, lying on the cabin roof and naming constellations that weren’t real.

“Don’t,” I whisper, more to myself than anything else. “Don’t start this.”

The humming stops.

I swallow hard and grab my suitcase from the trunk. The porch steps groan under my weight—one, two, three—and I have to pause on the top one because a flash of memory hits me: Elias sitting right there, grinning, tapping his fingers against his knee like he was drumming a heartbeat.

I squeeze my eyes shut.  
He’s dead. The whole town saw the body. I saw the body.

It doesn’t matter what I hear.

When I open the cabin door, the air inside is colder than outside, like the house forgot how to hold warmth without him.

It feels like walking into a grave.

I step inside anyway.

Because grief makes fools of us.

And love makes cowards.

And I’m both.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The cabin breathes around me.

That’s what it feels like as I step farther inside—like the walls expand with the cold, like the floorboards sigh under my boots. I set my suitcase by the couch and flick the light switch.

Nothing.

Of course. The power company never fixed the lines up here. The cabin’s been sitting untouched for over a year now, exactly the way He left it.

I grab the old lantern from the shelf by the door and turn the knob. The flame catches, soft and trembling, throwing shadows across the room in uneven waves. Dust dances in the air like ash.

It’s colder than it should be.

I move through the living room slowly, the lantern barely warming my fingertips. I try not to look at the couch, but my eyes pull toward it anyway—Elias and I crashed there after hikes, after storms, after long nights we pretended weren’t dates.

A blanket is still draped over the back.

I don’t remember leaving it like that.

My boots echo on the wooden floor as I walk to the bedroom. I force myself to breathe. In. Out. I open the door and—

Everything is exactly the same.

The bed, neatly made. The window cracked slightly, like someone opened it and forgot to close it. Elias’s flannel shirt still hanging from the corner of the closet door. I reach out, touching the fabric with numb fingers.

Cold.  
Too cold.

I pull back quickly and wipe my hands on my jeans. It doesn’t matter. 

It’s just an old shirt. A dead man’s shirt.

I turn to leave—

And something knocks.

Three soft, deliberate taps on the cabin’s front door.

My heart slams against my ribs. I freeze, head tilted toward the hallway.

The knock comes again.  
Not loud. Not threatening.  
Just… familiar.

My breath fogs in front of me.  
“Hello?” My voice cracks. I clear my throat. “Who’s there?”

Silence.

I move toward the living room, lantern held high, flame fluttering with every step. Shadows pulse across the walls. The temperature drops with each foot closer to the door.

My hand shakes as I reach the knob.

“Elias?” The name slips out before I can stop it.

I hate myself for it.

I open the door a crack.

Snowflakes drift in on a breath of wind, swirling on the porch. The forest stands quiet, dark, waiting. There’s no one outside.

But—

On the porch railing…

Faint. Almost invisible under the falling snow…

Fingerprints.  
A set of them. Pressed into the frost.  
Fresh.

And spaced exactly like someone had been drumming their fingers.

The way Elias always did.

A chill races down my back.

I close the door slowly, latch it, and step away.  
The lantern’s flame flickers violently.

For a moment, I swear I hear humming again—so low I feel it more than hear it, like a memory trying to crawl its way back into the world.

I swallow hard.

Maybe coming back was a mistake.

Maybe the dead really don’t stay gone.

I don’t sleep that first night.

I shove the dresser against the front door like that’s going to save me, then curl up on the couch with the lantern lit beside me. Every time the flame flickers, my heart jumps into my throat.

The cabin creaks and settles like old bones shifting under a sheet. The wind claws at the windows. And underneath all of it, barely audible…

Footsteps.

Slow. Careful. Not on the porch this time.

Circling the cabin.

I sit up, breath caught in my chest. The footsteps crunch through the snow, moving past the front door, then along the right side of the house.

My lantern flickers again.

I grip it tight and force myself to stand. My knees feel weak, but I cross the living room silently, edging toward the window.

Don’t look.  
Don’t do this.  
Just pretend you didn’t hear anything.

But curiosity is cruel like grief—it drags you toward the things that hurt.

I tilt the curtain back just enough to see outside.

The tree line sits thirty feet from the cabin. The snow is falling harder now, blanketing the ground and my old Jeep Cherokee in white.

For a moment, I see nothing.

And then—

A shape steps between the trees.

Human height.  
Human build.  
Standing unnaturally still, like it’s waiting for me to notice.

My pulse pounds in my ears.

I lift the lantern slightly, and the flame brightens just enough to catch the details.

The figure stands half in shadow, half in moonlight.

I can’t see its face.  
But the silhouette—

Broad shoulders.  
Messy hair.  
Hands at its sides, fingers trembling just enough to look familiar.

My breath leaves me in a broken whisper.

“…Elias?”

The figure shifts.

It tilts its head the way he always did when he was trying to figure out if I was upset or just pretending to be fine. My vision blurs with tears. I blink hard, trying to wipe them away, but when my eyes refocus—

The figure is gone.

Just gone.  
Like it stepped backward and the forest swallowed it.

I stagger away from the window, chest tight, throat burning.  
“No,” I whisper. “No, no, no…”

I back up until I hit the couch and sink onto it. My hands shake so violently I can barely hold the lantern.

It’s not him.  
It can’t be him.

But I saw him. I swear I saw him.

A sound snaps me out of my spiraling—something tapping against the window beside me.

Once.  
Twice.  
Slow, deliberate.

I turn my head, breath frozen in my lungs.

Another tap.

When I lift the lantern toward the glass, the flame jumps—

And there, on the other side of the frost-covered window,  
are five fingerprints.  
Fresh.  
Pressed into the ice from the outside.

The pattern is unmistakable.

He used to tap my window the same exact way when we were teenagers sneaking out to watch the meteor showers.

My stomach drops.

“Elias…” I whisper again, even though it hurts.

The lantern flames pops, shrinking suddenly, like it’s struggling against the cold.

When I look back at the window—  
the fingerprints are melting away.  
Disappearing almost as fast as they appeared.

Like something is pulling its hand back into the dark.

It hits me out of nowhere.

One minute I’m staring at the melting fingerprints on the window, and the next—

I’m back there.  
At the funeral.

Like someone grabbed my mind by the throat and dragged me straight into the memory.

The church was too small for his death.

That’s the first thing I remember.  
People spilled into the aisles, pressed shoulder-to-shoulder, whispering like the air itself might crack if they talked too loudly.

The coffin sat near the front.  
Closed.  
Because they said it was better that way.

I never asked why.  
I already knew.

I stood near the back, hands knotted in front of me like a child, avoiding every face that tried to look at me. Elias’s mother brushed past me once—her eyes red, her hands trembling—and I wanted to say something. Something comforting. Something that mattered.

But the words stuck in my throat like glass.

People talked about him like he wasn’t the same boy I loved. Like he was some saint carved out of all the things he never had the chance to do wrong. They talked like they hadn’t ignored him half of the time he was alive.

It made me sick.

I kept my eyes on the casket.

I kept waiting for him to sit up and ruin the whole ceremony with some dumb joke.

I kept waiting to hear him laugh.

The pastor said something. A prayer. A memory. A verse. I don’t remember any of it.

All I remember is the moment they started lowering him into the ground outside, snow falling harder than the forecast promised. Someone read a poem. Someone sobbed.

I didn’t cry.

Not one tear.

It was wrong, all of it.  
Too quiet.  
Too cold.  
Too final.

I waited for everyone to leave before I stepped closer to the grave. The mound of dirt looked obscene—like it was disrespectful for the earth to cover him. I knelt so fast my knees hit the frozen ground hard enough to bruise.

My breath hitched.

For the first time all day, it felt real.

“I wasn’t done,” I whispered. “You didn’t give me time. I wasn’t… I wasn’t ready.”

My hands shook. I pressed them into the soil like touching the ground meant touching him.

“I never told you,” I breathed.  
The words finally shaking loose.  
“I never told you how I—”

My voice broke before I could say it.

The sky stayed silent.

The snow kept falling.

No one heard me.

Not even him.

And then I’m back.

Snapped out of the memory like someone let go of the back of my neck. The cabin comes into focus around me—cold, dark, quiet.

My chest aches like I’ve been punched.

I wipe my face and realize I'm crying now, all the tears I didn’t cry at the funeral rushing out too late to matter.

The lantern flame sputters again.

Somewhere outside, in the trees, I hear it.

A low voice.  
Singing.

No words—just a tune.  
A melody I know too well.

The one we made up as kids.

My blood turns to ice.

“Stop,” I whisper, my voice raw from crying. “Please… stop doing this.”

But the singing doesn’t stop.

If anything, it gets closer.

The singing keeps drifting through the walls, soft and wavering, like someone humming through a cold mouth. The melody threads between the trees, slipping under the door, curling around my spine.

I can’t breathe with it inside the cabin.

So, I grab the lantern and step onto the porch.

The moment the door closes behind me, the singing stops.

The forest stands still.  
Silent.  
Expectant.

The snow is falling in slow, gentle flakes that make the world look softer than it feels. My breath clouds in front of me, and every exhale feels like a warning disappearing into the dark.

“Elias?”  
I whisper it before I can stop myself again.

Nothing answers.  
Nothing moves.

I step off the porch, boots sinking into snow that should be untouched this time of night.

It isn’t.

There are footprints.

One set.  
Bare feet.  
Human-shaped.

Heading *toward* the cabin.

The prints are deep, perfect, toes splayed slightly—exactly like Elias’s feet, the ones he used to complain were “bad for hiking” even though he could outrun me on any trail.

My stomach drops.

“Please,” I breathe. “Please tell me I’m dreaming.”

But the prints are real.  
Too real.

I lift the lantern and follow them a few steps out into the yard. They’re crisp at first, then start to blur as the snow continues to fall.

I trace them with my eyes—forward, forward—

And then they just… stop.

Mid-stride.  
In the open.  
As if whoever made them vanished straight into the air.

My chest tightens.  
I take one slow step backward.

A branch snaps behind me.

I spin so fast the lantern nearly slips from my hand. The flame wavers but stays lit.

At the edge of the trees, something moves.

Not enough to see clearly—just a slip of shadow between two pines, tall and still as a figure watching me. My pulse hammers against my ribs.

“Say something,” I whisper.  
A plea. A demand. I don’t even know.

The shadow shifts.

Then…

“Ro…?”

The voice is Elias’s.  
Perfectly him.  
Warm. Soft.  
Like the way he said my name when he was half-asleep and didn’t want me to leave.

My knees nearly buckle.

I press a hand to my mouth, a sob threatening to break loose.

“That’s not real,” I whisper against my fingers.  
But the voice in the trees tries again, more confident this time:

“Rowan.”

Not questioning.  
Calling.

My throat closes.  
My vision blurs.  
Every part of me wants to run into the forest and bury myself in the sound of him.

But something is wrong—too wrong.  
The cold around me sharpens, biting at my skin like needles. The lantern flickers wildly, flame straining against the wind.

Another step echoes between the trees.

Then another.

Coming toward me.

Slow.  
Measured.  
Like someone remembering how to walk.

I back toward the porch, heart racing.

“Elias, you’re dead,” I choke. “You can’t be…”

The voice interrupts me.

Not whispering now.  
Not gentle.

Firm.  
Close.

“Come here.”

It’s his voice.  
Every note of it.  
But there’s a hollowness underneath, like something wearing him from the inside.

I run.

My boots slip on the snow, the lantern jerking wildly in my hand. I scramble up the steps and fumble with the door, nearly dropping the light as I shove it open and slam it behind me.

The porch creaks.

Something heavy lands on it.

Standing right outside.

Breathing.

Slow, ragged breaths that don’t sound like they belong to anything human anymore.

I press my back against the door, shaking so hard I can barely stay upright. My heartbeat drowns out everything else.

For a moment, the breathing stops.

Then…

A single knock.  
Soft.  
Deliberate.  
At the exact height of Elias’s knuckles when he used to tap my window.

I clap a hand over my mouth to keep from screaming.

The knock comes again.

And a voice—Elias’s voice—whispers through the wood:

“Let me in, Ro.”

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sleep pulls at me like a tide, and before I realize it, I’m back in that summer, *our* summer, when Elias still woke before the sun and smelled like fresh-cut wood and warm soil.

The dream doesn’t ease me in. It drops me straight into him.

His skin is tan from weeks spent working outside, sun-kissed and warm beneath my hands. I can see every freckle scattered across his shoulders, little constellations I used to trace with my fingertips. He laughed the first time I tried to count them all—said it tickled. But I kept doing it anyway. I liked the way he’d pretend to be annoyed, only to pull me in closer.

His brown hair falls into his eyes as he leans over me, the same way it always did. I used to brush it back without thinking. Now even the dream version of me hesitates, afraid he’ll disappear if I touch him too quickly.

When he looks at me, those dark brown eyes soften like they always did—warm and steady and impossibly sure. He kisses me slow, the kind of kiss that makes the whole world fall away, and I swear I can feel the rough calluses on his hands as they slide over my hips. Elias was always gentle, even when he didn’t know his own strength.

The freckles across the bridge of his nose—God, I forgot how many there were. Or maybe I tried to forget. I loved those freckles. They made him look younger, softer, like the boy he was before the world got its claws into him.

In the dream, he smiles at me. He whispers my name. And for a moment—just a moment—I get to believe he’s still alive. That I didn’t bury him. That the heroin didn’t take him from me. That I’m not waking up alone.

But the light around us starts to flicker, like a candle fighting a draft.

And I know the dream is about to twist.

As he pulls away from my lips his mouth falls open and bile pours out on top of me. 

Sweet and sour. 

I wake gasping, the memory of his touch still burning across my skin.

For a heartbeat, I’m still in the warmth of the dream. But then… something in the room is wrong.

I freeze.

There, at the foot of the bed, is a shadow. Taller than it should be. Still. Silent. Elias.

But… not right. His skin is pale, almost gray in the faint moonlight filtering through the curtains. His dark brown eyes are empty pits. The freckles across his nose seem to shift, like they’re bugs crawling over him instead of resting naturally.

I can feel my stomach drop. My hands clench the sheets.

“No!” My voice cracks. I swing my arm toward the lamp and hit the switch.

The room explodes in light.

The bed groans under me as I scramble backward.

He’s gone.

No. Not gone. Something scurries—too fast, too low to the ground—slipping past the doorframe. The shadows swallow him. A scrape of wood on floorboards, and the slam of the front door, then silence.

I collapse onto the bed, chest heaving, trembling all over. My hands shake as I clutch the covers to my face.

I don’t know how long I sit there, trying to convince myself I imagined it. But I *saw* him. I felt him.

And something tells me… it wasn’t my mind at all.

Morning comes too soon, pale and gray, snow muffling the world outside.

I stare at the cabin door, feeling the weight of last night’s terror settle over me like a stone.

I can’t stay here.  
I *can’t.*

I pack a few essentials, shaking. My lantern sits unused in the corner. My boots crunch against the snow as I step outside, trying to ignore the memory of the shape at the foot of the bed, the way it moved.

The forest is quiet. Too quiet.

The cabin stands behind me, smoke and shadows from the night still lingering in the corners of my vision.

I glance back, heart hammering, and mutter under my breath:  
“I have to leave… I *have* to leave.”

But even as I walk down the path, a part of me knows that leaving isn’t enough. Something followed me here last night. Something that knows exactly what—or who—I want.

The road is empty, slick with snow, when I finally stop the car. My hands are still shaking from last night, from the dream, from the shape I *saw* standing at the foot of my bed.

I should be heading down the mountain, back to something safe, back to the world that doesn’t creep through shadows and mimic voices. But then… a figure steps onto the road.

A native man in a thick coat and wide-brimmed hat, snow dusting the brim. A ranger, I realize, though the badge on his chest doesn’t calm me.

“Need some help?” he asks, voice low, steady.

I explain what happened last night in fragments, trembling. The shadow at the foot of the bed, the prints in the snow, everything. I told him that someone must be snooping around the cabin and messing with me.

He nods slowly, listening, then gestures to the road ahead.

“The bridge collapsed last night during the storm too much snow fell on it and it couldn’t take the weight,” he says. “There’s no way down until the snow lets up. And another one’s coming tonight. You’re stuck until morning.”

I curse under my breath. “I can’t stay there… something’s wrong. I saw—”

He holds up a hand, cutting me off. His eyes are sharp, but kind. “I know what you think you saw. Don’t believe everything in the woods. Sometimes people see things because they want to. Sometimes… things *want* to be seen.”

I swallow hard. “Like ghosts?”

He shakes his head slowly. “My people have many names for it, some you’re not supposed to say, I call them *Mimics*. Old legends around these parts. Shapeshifters, they feed on longing. Takes the form of what you want most. But it’s not… *him*. Not really.”

I shiver. “How do I stop it?”

“Don’t feed it, starve the fucker,” he says simply. “Don’t give it reason to linger. And I’ll check on you before nightfall, and again in the morning. You have to stay put tonight. Lock up and don’t let It in.”

I nod numbly, heart pounding. I don’t like it. I don’t *like* staying. But I have no choice.

The cabin waits like a corpse when I return. Snow muffles the world outside. I step inside and lock the door, but the fear from last night lingers, cold and sharp in the air.

I move to the corner of the living room, the corner where Elias’s old boxes are stacked. Dusty, unloved, forgotten… except to me.

I pull the first one open.

And there they are. Letters.  
Hundreds of them. Every one folded neatly, written in his small, careful handwriting. My name scrawled across the top of each envelope, declarations of love I never received, words he never spoke aloud.

I sink to the floor with the box in my lap, trembling. 

The first one I pick up smells faintly of cedar and ink, like he’d tucked it under his pillow for weeks. My fingers trace the neat handwriting, each loop and curl of letters familiar in a way that makes my chest ache.

I sink into the corner of the cabin floor, the box of letters spilling open around me like snow melting into memory.

 

*“Rowan, I wish I could tell you everything I feel without the world hearing. One day, you’ll know.”*

*“I hate that I can’t say it. That I have to hide it. I hope you’ll forgive me someday.”*

Tears slide down my cheeks. The Mimic isn’t here—at least, not yet—but it doesn’t matter. I can feel it circling, listening. And every word in these letters makes it stronger.

I clutch one to my chest. His words burn against me, and the longing in me—the part that still aches, still loves him—feels like a tether.

I know what I have to do.

But I don’t know if I have the courage.

*“Rowan, I can’t stop thinking about the way your hair catches the sunlight. I hope you know, even if I never say it, that you are the only one I’ve ever wanted.”*

I press it to my face. Breathe him in. For a moment, the grief fades, replaced by warmth, by him. I can almost feel the brush of his fingers against mine, the small, perfect weight of his hand in mine.

I read the next.

*“I wish I could tell you everything I feel without the world listening. I dream of us, Rowan. I dream of a life where we’re not afraid of what people might say, or the time we waste pretending we’re just friends. One day… one day, I hope you’ll know.”*

The tears come, unstoppable now. I hug the letters to my chest. He’s here. He’s *here*. Not in the flesh, not in reality, but in these words, in these lines I never got to hear aloud.

The Mimic is quiet for now, lurking in the corners. I can feel it, I know I can. It’s patient, waiting, feeding off the ache that the letters stir up inside me. And every word I read, every memory I relive, is giving it strength.

I dig deeper. Another letter falls out, unfolded, edges curled like it had been read and reread hundreds of times.

*“I see you in my dreams, even when I shouldn’t. I want to tell you the truth, Rowan, the things I could never say when I was alive. I love you. I always have. I always will. Please forgive me for leaving before I could.”*

I scream into my hands, muffled, sobbing, because it’s too much. Too much grief. Too much him.

And I realize something horrible.

The cabin isn’t safe. The letters aren’t safe. Every single memory, every line of love he ever wrote, is a tether. A beacon. And the Mimic—whatever it is, whatever shape it takes—is drawn to it. Drawn to *me*.

I can’t just leave. I can’t just hide.

I have to destroy it.  
I have to get rid of everything.

I sit in the snow-dusted floor, clutching the letters, heart pounding, shaking so badly my hands ache. The thought of it tastes like both terror and release.

Tomorrow… tomorrow I’ll start.

But tonight… tonight I just hold him in my hands.  
And let the grief soak in.

There’s a knock at the door before I can even start packing anything, sharp and deliberate. My heart leaps into my throat.

I pull it open. The Ranger from the road stands there, snow dusting his coat, eyes calm but assessing.

“Thought I’d check on you,” he says.

I step aside, shaking. “Come in. Coffee?”

He nods, and I lead him into the living room. I set the kettle on, trying to act normal while my hands tremble.

We sit. I wrap my hands around the warm mug. The letters are on the floor beside me.

He glances at them, frowning. “What were you doing?”

“I found his letters…I was just reading.” I said while taking a sip of my coffee

 He reaches down and picks one up and frowns, “These are blank?” 

My chest collapses. “What do you mean? Elias… he…”

“The Mimic,” he says quietly. “It’s been feeding on your grief. Those letters… you *think* they’re his words. But they’re just the Mimic shaping what you most want to see. Nothing here is real but you and it.”

The room spins. I press my hand to my forehead. “I… I thought—”

“I know,” he says softly. “I’ve seen this before. You’re not imagining yourself crazy. But it isn’t him.”

He stands. “I should get home to my son. It’s late.”

I glance at him, panic clawing my stomach. “Do you… want me to come with you?”

He shakes his head. “You need to face this. Tonight, at least. Plus, I’d like to keep this thing far from my kid. Stay alive until morning. I’ll check back first thing. But you have to stay inside.”

I nod, swallowing hard. He leaves, and the door clicks shut behind him. The cabin feels smaller somehow, colder, the shadows sharper.

I try to collect myself, deciding a shower will calm my nerves. Steam curls around the bathroom like a warm fog. I step in, letting the water wash over me, trying to breathe.

Then I hear it.

Soft. Behind the curtain.

I freeze. My heart stops. The curtain moves. Slowly, something tall and wrong presses against it.

A dark shape.

And then… its jaw drops open. Too wide. Too wrong. And a low, buzzing begins, deep and resonant, vibrating through the tiles and into my bones.

“Leave me alone!” I scream. My hands grip the curtain, trying to hold it back.

It lunges. Fast. Arms wrap around me, pulling the shower curtain over my head, suffocating, pinning me against the wall. Panic claws up my throat.

I fight. Kick. Punch. My fingers scrape for anything solid.

The lid of the toilet hits my hand. I snatch it, swing blindly—and connect.

The creature shrieks, a sound that’s part human, part metal, something ancient, and slithers back, wriggling through the bathroom window into the snow and night.

I pull off the curtain, gasp for air, and stumble out. My boots and jacket are still on the floor, grabbing them, I throw them on and fling open the door.

There it is. Standing in the treeline.

Jaw crooked, twisted from where I hit it. Buzzing faintly. Watching me.

It calls to me. Not in words, just a warped, guttural echo of Elias’s voice:

*“Roooowwwwaaaaan…”*

Something inside me snaps. Grief. Rage. Fear. All tangled into one fiery cord.

I can’t let it feed on me anymore. I step out into the snowstorm and march for the work shed.

I grab a can of gasoline from the corner. I glance around the cabin, at the letters, the walls, the floorboards.

Tonight…

Tonight, it all burns.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The cabin is so quiet I can hear my own heartbeat bouncing off the walls.  
It sounds wrong in here. Too loud. Too human.

I unscrew the gas can and start pouring, the smell hitting me like a slap. The liquid splashes across the old pine floors, soaking into the wood Elias and I once tracked mud across after hiking the Ridge Trail. I try not to think about that summer. I try not to think about him at all.

But everything in this place remembers him.

My boots stick slightly with each step as I make a path from wall to wall. Photographs stare at me from the mantel—Elias on the porch steps, Elias holding a fish he pretended not to be proud of, Elias and me, shoulder to shoulder, smiling like grief wasn’t waiting just around the corner.

My throat burns. I dump the last of the gasoline and back away.

It’s time.

I take a match from the box. My hand trembles.  
Just one spark. Just one moment of courage. Or cowardice. I don’t even know the difference anymore.

I lift the match, ready to strike—

And suddenly… I’m not in the cabin anymore.

Memories crash over me so hard I stagger.  
Elias laughing, sunlight in his hair.  
Elias handing me hot cocoa, our fingers brushing.  
The way he looked at me once, like he knew.  
His casket.  
The silence that followed. I strike the match.

I choke on a sob. The match hovers uselessly between my fingers.

“Stop,” I whisper to no one. Or maybe to myself. “Please… just let me do this.”

The air shifts. The cold slides in behind me like a shadow stretching its spine.

I know what’s happening a split second before I feel it.

I turn—

And something punches straight through me.

A sharp, bone-like limb tears out of my chest. My breath leaves me in a wet gasp. The match slips from my fingers, falling, falling—

It hits the gasoline.

The fire ignites instantly, racing across the floor with a roar.  
The cabin explodes in heat behind me.

I’m dragged outside, landing hard in the snow. The cold should be shocking, but all I feel is warmth spreading across my stomach—my blood soaking through my clothes.

Then… arms wrap around me.

Elias’s arms.

I blink up, vision blurring, and he’s there. He’s *there*, holding me against his chest the way I used to imagine when I couldn’t sleep. His face is gentle. His eyes shine like he’s relieved I finally came back to him.

“Elias…” My voice cracks. “I’m sorry… I tried…”

He whispers my name. Soft. Loving. Perfect.

I don’t care if it’s real.

I don’t care about anything anymore.

I let my head rest on his shoulder as the world burns behind us and snow drifts over my legs. My breathing slows. My fingers go numb. But I feel safe. Warm. Loved.

For the first time since he died… I’m not alone.

I exhale one last breath, sinking into the version of him I could never let go.

Darkness comes soft as snowfall.

And I let it take me…

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Hours later, snow crunches under boots.

Voices. One familiar. The other smaller, younger.

The Ranger and his son appear at the edge of the burned clearing, eyes wide at the sight before them.

There I am.

Frozen. Pale. Stiff. The fire has gone out, leaving nothing but ash and a cruel reminder of what I tried to do. My hair dusted with snow, my lips blue, my hands clutching the remnants of the ""letters"" as if I might still be able to hold on to him.

The Ranger drops to his knees, horror etched across his face. “Damned girl…” His voice is thick, catching in his throat.

His son stands behind him, silent, unsure, eyes wide.

He reaches for me, hand trembling. There’s nothing to do. No warmth, no pulse. The snow has claimed me.

The Mimic is gone. The cabin is gone. I’m gone.

But in the stillness, the memory of Him—the letters, the laughter, the way he smiled at me—lingers like smoke in the cold morning air.

The Ranger leans back, face pale, hands gripping the snow. “I’m so sorry this happened to you,” he says softly. “I’m so sorry…”

The boy doesn’t speak. He only stares.

And somewhere, in the wind that rustles through the trees, there’s a faint hum. Not entirely human. Not entirely gone.

I thought the fire would’ve ended it all, but in the frost-bitten silence, I knew the longing in the woods would never die…",1,1763284750.0,spoopycjades,0,1.0,False

And replying to a comment , i had asked if guys would get creeped out if a stranger girl were to ask you out and the majority guys replied that they welcome it and find it as an ego boost. 

So we are gonna have fun discussion today based on that...

So what are your experiences when you asked someone out VS when you got asked out..

As OP : 

I asked out :  One time

Years back, i asked a guy out for dinner. He was my crush/friend during Uni days, like at that time i was in my dork phase la tbh.. he accepted and we went for dinner. Had a nice time but it didn't take off. He rejected when i confessed like a month later..so yeahh


Someone asked me : 

Countless, i dont have the count tbh.. this was post glow up phase...
But a memorable one would be during covid period i was working part time at a clothing store and this guy Ang Moh who was a frequent customer at the store , asked if i was free to go for coffee after my shift.. He was polite and direct but i declined cuz i wasnt interested and i mentally wasnt in that phase..

So this question is out for both guys/girls, if both scenarios are applicable to you, mention both sides.. thanks!!

Since black friday is coming up i am on the look for a coffee machine. I used to have a Philips 3000series  for 5 years until it broke down.

I have seen the Delonghi Magnifica S ECAM22.112 which is priced with the black friday discount at 350euros

It seems i cannot find anything for this model…i can find a lot of reviews though for ecam22.110 etc. 

1) Is it the same?
2) how delonghi performs ? Is it similar to the philips one?
3) we have several coffee machine brands that are discounted for example …Ninja, Philips, Bosch, siemens …should I choose one of this instead of the Delonghi one?

Any help/tips/recommendations will be appreciated FYI i dont drink milk so I dont want it with the milk accessories

1oyh99q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oyh99q,Learned something new today!,"My coffee was given to me in this mug today while visiting someone else's house, and immediately upon looking at it I recognized Apollo. But I didn't recognize the other man with a club, and had no idea why they were on a Gemini mug.

Turns out, though the twins Castor and Pollux are most commonly associated with the sign, there is also a myth about Apollo and Heracles that is tied to Gemini. Apparently they wrestled so hard that their battle just had to be immortalized in the stars lol.

And it doesn't stop there! Most modern associations tie Hermes to Gemini due to the planetary association with Mercury- and while the messenger god has some connection to it, his primary association is actually with Cancer, and the god associated with Gemini? Apollo. According to Manilius, anyway. And Apollo actually has ties to the planet Mercury as well, since it used to be believed there were two separate Mercuries, one in the morning and one in the evening. The evening one belonged to Hermes, of course, and the morning one was associated with Apollo.

I didn't know most of this before today, and I would have continued not knowing if I hadn't looked up why Apollo was on a Gemini mug lol. Maybe he gave me a little nudge to inspire me to go learn something. Either way, I found it really neat and thought I should share in case someone else finds it as interesting as I do :)",10,1763284647.0,Hellenism,0,1.0,False

It was a cold day in Hokkaido, and worse yet for lance, he had missed his flight to musutafu. Lance had come all the way from America to try out for UA, and now he wouldn’t have the chance, so he took a walk to clear his mind. As he walked he saw the try outs for the less  popular of the two hero-course schools try outs were today as well.  
“dammit…..i could still try…..better than nothing” He thought out loud to himself, he desperately wanted to be a hero, a pro-hero among pros.
So, lance walked in that direction hoping he could still make it. As he walked he passed by a coffee shop, out front sipping on a hot coffee was the most messy, rat’s nest hair, scrawny kid he’d ever seen.  

“he can’t be much older than me, about 14 too….” He thought to himself, and something in him told him he should talk to him, missed try out or not. He approached him, to the messy shut in of a person all he saw was a tall, fit, blonde American with a bright smile rivaling all might’s rapidly approaching this unsocialized weirdo.  

“hey! Mind if sit here?” lance asked out, the shut in simply nodded and held his coffee tighter.
“Thanks, names lance….lance powers, and you are?”

The mess of a teenager looked up at him and sheepishly said “uhh…shin…shin Kurosawa” Shin paused before continuing “your Japanese is really good”

Lance nodded and flashed a even brighter smile “thanks! Been working on it. So shin, are you about to head to jojin academy tryouts too?”

Shin shook his head, his hair swaying “no, not at all. But your quirk must be pretty strong to want to try out for any of them.”  
“thanks! My quirk is counter, if I meet a attack head on with my fist it absorbs the power and I can give it right back to them with my other fist” shin had been hanging on every word, he was thoroughly impressed and could see lance had the quirk and attitude of a hero. Lance continued with a politer tone
“if ya don’t mind me asking? What’s your quirk?”  

“o-oh! Mine’s…..lightball….i can make a ball of bright light…it gets hot too I guess” shin said disappointedly. Lance grimaced, not because shins quirk sounded weak, but because lance hated that shin obviously wasn’t secure feeling in his own quirk.

“Dude! That’s still useful! You could help with searching and rescue! Or even support combat! You should come to the try outs with me!” shin sunk into his chair, scared of the prospect of being a hero and even more scared of giving up his shut in life.
“I-I’m good, I-I’m small and weak with a bad quirk…” shin said, lance could tell he wasn’t fishing for compliments, but rather truly believed it.

“Dude, you won’t know until you try, besides not like you have anything else going on”
Shin grimaced, because he knew lance was right.
“o-ok”

That’s all lance needed, he stood back up with his backpack and grabbed shin by the arm
“Off we go!’
Shin yelped like kicked puppy, and lance laughed. This was the start of a very long journey.

First, we can admit that simply using the price-to-earnings ratio, the market looks overpriced. Since markets are forward-looking, let me paint a view that could justify the valuations in the MAG7. 

https://preview.redd.it/svut5jvw4l1g1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=e449d2bde3244e66e2f7d1b84af3f0d96e900249

This chart goes back 5 years, showing the SP500, GDP and Employment/Unemployment levels. In the middle, we can see the release of ChatGPT-4, which is arguably the first really useful LLM. As we move to the right, we start to see employment growth stall except for the spike in Jan 2025. We can see that unemployment numbers have steadily increased. So even with **the same number of employees** and increasing unemployment, **GDP has continued to rise**. The only way this is possible is if the employees are doing more, or perhaps a combination of AI and assisted AI is completing the work.

You may have heard of Vibe Coding, but current agentic tools like OpenAI Codex, Claude Code and Google's Jules literally act as a member of a software team that can work on specific tasks like solving bugs and adding features. You can make a request or perhaps multiple requests, then go grab a cup of coffee and come back to finished work, which would have taken a human a minimum of hours up to a day to complete each task. We can see that software developers are, in fact, hurting.

[](https://preview.redd.it/ai-hype-might-be-real-not-a-bubble-v0-pou5pazt3l1g1.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=377161ca0c31fb18446317d6b3c871ac075316ff)

The number of employed software developers is decreasing. The last time this drastic a loss occurred was the Dot Com bubble. In that case companies were going bust, and the market showed that. Now we can assume AI is taking developer jobs, not that there is a secret reduction in demand. If you are unsure of the current Software developer market, just check out [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) to read complaints about finding jobs.

Bringing up bubbles, I watched a video by How Money Works. My biggest takeaway is that AI investments are coming from the companies themselves, using their stockpiled reserves. If AI turns out to be a big bust, nearly all the MAG7 have their core business to fall back on. So if the bubble pops, it's not like Google or Apple will be filing for bankruptcy, and while SPY is heavily weighted in these companies, these companies aren't going anywhere.

Ultimately, I would like to think that these companies know something we don't. And if labor across the entire economy can be reduced and these companies, through their AI, become the labor at cost savings, they are likely to come out as winners at the cost of employees. When the divide happens, hopefully we all can be on the side of the haves and instead of the have-nots.",0,1763284408.0,StockMarket,20,0.42,False

My name is Anthony. I’m a 35-year-old man (US, ET time zone) who thrives on thoughtfulness, curiosity, and mutual experiences.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Creativity and artistry are important to me. Personally, I write: about my observations, thoughts, and lived experiences. I also dabble in photography.

Little and foundational things fill the spaces of my life, some of which include coffee, both simple and bitter and excessively frilly concoctions, burning incense, because I've always thought the smoke is cool, archiving and organizing, collecting (written texts, oddities and cool things), and time pieces.

On MacArthur Boulevard you’ll find a row of quaint storefronts. Coffee shops, burger joints, martial arts studios, and insurance agencies. Elbowing in the middle, at # 1039, is the headquarters of the Alameda County Republican Party.

How did this happen? In the belly of the East Bay, where liberal and progressive politics dominate, how did the GOP set up shop to sell [American fascism](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/05/03/is-trumpism-a-form-of-fascism-two-historians-debate_6740864_23.html)? Well, let’s find out.

\*\*\*

The exact founding date for the Alameda County Republican Central Committee isn’t public. [Filings show](https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00404020/) that it was registered with the FEC on July 26, 2004. The location on 1039 MacArthur Boulevard has been its mailing address every year since. Given San Leandro’s history as a [redlining](https://www.sanleandro.org/1089/San-Leandro-Redlined) [sundown town](https://justice.tougaloo.edu/sundowntown/san-leandro-ca/) surrounded by a [suburban wall](https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/01/archives/tv-the-suburban-wall-examined-on-channel-13.html) of White Supremacy, patrolled by racist police, with cross-burnings still going on as recently as [1989](https://www.sanleandro.org/1091/After-Redlining), the choice starts to make sense.

The current chair of the organization is [Jeanne Solnordal](https://ballotpedia.org/Jeanne_Solnordal), who owns a property management company in the Oakland-Piedmont area. She’s never held elected office, but she’s sure lost a few times trying, from Piedmont City Council to State Assembly and State Senate. The rest of their board and membership is hidden. But based on their financial statements, they take a lot of money from special interests in the real estate industry, law enforcement, as well as the state and national GOP organizations.

The Alameda County Republican Party’s [“guiding principles”](https://www.alamedagop.org/) are allegedly: individual liberty, individual prosperity, and individual security. They don’t seem to care much about community or solidarity, let alone justice. It’s also unclear how they square those principles with the Trump regime’s efforts to [criminalize free speech](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/trump-no-longer-free-speech-00574219), attack [transgender people](https://glaad.org/trump-accountability-tracker/), destroy the economy with [illegal tarrifs](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn93e12rypgo), and [kidnap our immigrant neighbors](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-ice-secret-police-civil-rights-unaccountable).

The group meets monthly in private. They work closely with Republican groups seeded throughout the East Bay, including the East Bay Republican Club, the Tri-Valley Republicans, and the Alameda Conservative Republican Patriots. What little information they do publicize seems to show mostly White crowds dining on dry Cobb salad and listening to presentations from astroturf organizations like the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association. (The rest of their social media is filled with laughter at immigrants attacked by ICE, praise for bigots like Charlie Kirk, and other Republican red meat.)

On their website, they say, “Powered by People Like You.” And right below are two rows of blank photo boxes. The irony is so loud, it’s screaming.

[\(Section of AC GOP website\)](https://preview.redd.it/lvn9khsz3l1g1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=554cfeadbd386cb3f5db41dbc175af3689b25289)

\*\*\*

You might ask, so what? Who cares? Isn’t this just your opinion? What harm can they do? And it’s a free country, right? If it bothers you so much, why don’t you just ignore it? Those are all reasonable arguments.

Well, if I might break Godwin’s Law a little bit here: imagine you’re sitting at a table with 9 people and suddenly [someone with a sw\*st\*ka joins you](https://stopracebasedhate.ca/racist-comments/theyre-not-all-racist/). Nobody says anything. Nobody does anything. Everyone continues on with their business. At that point, you don’t have a table with 9 people and 1 N\*zi, you have a table of 10 N\*zis.

Put it another way, if a N\*zi bar opened up in town, how would you feel about that? What if nobody tried to get rid of the N\*zi bar? What if people acted like the N\*zi bar was just a normal part of neighborhood, even if they never went there?

I’m not saying the Republican party are a bunch of N\*zis... Yet. But they’re [trying very hard](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/14/private-chat-among-young-gop-club-members-00592146) to become them.

Meanwhile, San Leandro actually did have a N\*zi bar - back when The Manor was a local base for the K\* Kl\*x Kl\*n. And nobody did anything about it back then either.

\*\*\*

There are many reasonable arguments to tolerate terrible people. We live in a society, after all. But [you cannot tolerate intolerance](https://medium.com/extra-extra/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376). You cannot have a truce with people whose ultimate goal is the destruction of the very society that allows for peaceful, mutual coexistence in the first place. No matter how reasonable or respectable they pretend to be. Democracy is a frog swimming in a river and fascism is a scorpion riding on its back, stinging even as [everyone drowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog). They’ll always and inevitably seek conflict and cruelty to secure their own power and control over others.

There can be no peace with [fascists](https://buckscountybeacon.com/2025/10/donald-trump-and-the-maga-movements-aspirational-fascism/). And [the Republican party](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1600910X.2025.2481159) are, without a doubt, fascists.

[\(AC GOP Public Group Photo\)](https://preview.redd.it/j3doadi24l1g1.jpg?width=1857&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=781f3a2761100171665cfe0c10c0137556a8f275)

\*\*\*

I don’t know whether San Leandro is ready to kick out the Republican party peddling fascism in our community. I don’t know whether a coordinated campaign to drive them out would even be successful.

There was an [historic red-shift](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/politics/presidential-election-2024-red-shift.html) across the country in the 2024 election, including here. More people than ever before voted for a candidate who we know [r\*p\*d children](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-jeffrey-epsteins-newly-released-emails-about-trump). More people than ever before voted for a candidate who advocated [destroying our democracy and our wrecking our economy](https://ourpublicservice.org/federal-harms-tracker/cost-to-your-community/). (Even accurately reporting what the Republican party is now doing will get you accused of [“Trump Derangement Syndrome.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_derangement_syndrome) A perjorative designed to silence criticism of the regime and pathologize democratic resistance.)

Unfortunately, there’s never been any documented attempt to protest the Alameda County Republican Party here before, and San Leandro itself has never chosen to fight back until [very recently](https://www.facebook.com/groups/50501movement/posts/1174110974326230/).

Eventually we’ll have to make a choice though. Which side are we going to be on? Fascism or democracy? The people or the plutocrats? Liberty or oppression? Justice or injustice? These aren’t abstract ideas. They’re why millions of people are now starving. They’re why so many children aren’t receiving an education. They’re why tens of thousands of people are losing their jobs. They’re why the gap between the rich and rest of us has become a chasm, with [millions struggling to survive](https://sdvoice.info/millions-suffer-as-trumps-economy-crumbles/).

They’re why we need to build a better San Leandro for everyone.

Take note and take care.

But one guy stands out, even if I haven't met him yet. After xAP I didn't know I could have another strong connection like this again. Not just the sexting, it goes way deeper than that (no pun intended). But he is reluctant to meet, as this would be his first 'adventure'. If I ditch the rest and he bails out eventually I have to start all over again and I have no energy for that.

I chose to say goodbye to one of the coffee dates bc well, gotta go back to one guy, right? Desciscions need to be made. But he gets all emotional about the click we had and I feel so guilty! I feel like shit tbh. 

Can any of you ladies give me some pointers on how to deal with this? Share some of your experiences how to filter after an ad.

And for the guys, am I being too soft here? 

Help me, I'm hevaing sleepless nights and I thought it was fun 'shopping' around.  
I hope my story makes any sense. I'm looking forward to some advice here. Thanks in advance 🙏🏻🙏🏻",0,1763283444.0,adultery,6,0.25,False

[Gaggia Classic E24 / Kinggrinder K6],"I've had a Gaggia Classic E24 for a few weeks. The machine hasn't been modified yet, but I immediately bought a bottomless portafilter, a WDC tool, and the spring tamper from Normcore. My grinder is the KingGrinder K6, because I didn't want a large electric grinder and I've read many positive reviews about KingGrinder.

Now, to my problem:

I tested coffee bean A and found the correct setting at 25 clicks on the grinder, i.e., 18g → 37g in 25 seconds.

Then I wanted to test coffee bean B and found the correct setting at 30 clicks on the grinder, i.e., 18g → 37g in 25 seconds.

It's a bit strange that there's a 5-click difference, but maybe such large differences are normal.

The next day, I wanted to brew coffee bean A again, set to 25 clicks... but now it took 40 seconds for 18g → 37g???

This phenomenon has already occurred a few times for me. However, my brewing process is always the same.

I'm starting to believe my grinder might have a problem. Or am I doing something wrong?

I can also turn the grinder past the zero point down to -5 clicks, meaning my 25-click setting is actually 20 clicks in reality. According to KingGrinder's description, espresso is supposed to be around 40 clicks.

Please, can anyone help me? It's extremely frustrating never knowing how the espresso will turn out, even when you think you've already found the correct setting.",1,1763283357.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1oygwdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/hotels/comments/1oygwdv/sonder_failed_because/,Sonder failed because…,"… because hotels are a wheel that did not need a tech remaking. 

A shocking ending for an unsurprising company. Forgive me.. the words were mixed up: An unsurprising ending for a shocking company. 

On the outside Sonder appeared exciting. A hotel meets Airbnb meets apartment meets Silicon Valley tech combination.  It essentially was just a retool of the Airbnb model except instead of individual owned houses/apartments, sonder utilized apartment/hotel buildings. But more on that later. 

Sonder failed for many reasons and let’s start from the top:

**Francis**. The one time ceo and co-founder of the company. A ghostly figure on company slack channels. When the company would host its all hands video calls and he would enter the screen.. in what was probably the darkest most depressing corner of Pharrell’s mansion that he bought during better times.. the more he spoke the more a few things became clear: he didn’t really know much about the business he was running.. when employees would ask questions he didn’t have the answers.. he lacked confidence/ knowledge and ownership in business topics, and mostly he just deferred to other senior staff to lead the calls. Perhaps that’s a perk of being a founder.. you can just sit back and let others lead, when in any other company you would not be qualified to hold that position. 

When the Marriott deal was announced and he announced his departure  that was one of the biggest red flags. Why leave when a tremendous deal occurred. Would Marriott not want him as a consultant or point person to lead. If not ceo then why not remain on the board as chairman or member. It’s as if he saw the writing on the wall and left before the collapse that would place the blame on him. This was no titanic story, he as captain did not go down with the ship. He jumped on a lifeboat to safety miles before the iceberg showed up. 

 How much did he really know or didn’t know is anyone’s guess but when you’re the leader the buck stops with you.. the standards and foundations you set are what the company grows from. Clearly the foundation was shaky and settling to the point that cracks formed and later resulted in instability and catastrophic failure. 

**The concept**. 

Sonder failed because the hotel industry is a very well understood concept that does not need changing. Sure design, amenities, and locale will differ but the standard idea of : rent a room, check in, stay, leave.. are uniform throughout the industry. Sonder removed that by developing a hands off pre verification approach.  Guests would verify offsite via a multi step online application and upon approval, use codes to enter buildings and spaces. It was marketed towards younger travelers who perhaps were less interested in traditional doormen/bellman/front desks/concierge and all the other familiar faces once would see at a hotel. They also at least initially had the tech understanding to complete the pre arrival process. The problem? It alienates everybody else. Another problem.. the startup mentality does not translate to the tradition that is hotel lodging. 

**The Realestate**:

One of Sonder’s biggest mistakes was not owning any of their properties. They were not franchisees. Each property was an individual signed lease, no different than renting an apartment. Just more expensive. They were at the mercy of landlords in a high stakes game of monopoly. In the name of growth and greed sonder signed lease after lease at times over a dozen per city. It begs to question what was the real estate team thinking.. perhaps they were more concerned with bonuses and commissions rather than analyzing long term stability of the properties. When you work with landlords you are at their mercy. And in what world do landlords every agree to a reduction in rent? So when you stop paying rent, the landlords can kick you out of the building. Which many did. And when your buildings due to size and popularity are financial lifelines for a city.. there will only be collapse. 

**Bad money management** 

Perhaps one of the most prominent mistakes was taking a hotel company public in the middle of a global pandemic. The hotel industry shut down during Covid. Why would a hospitality company go public in the middle of a worldwide crisis that shut down travel and hotels? What did you think would happen to the stock price?

Moving on. Sonder spaces were beautiful. If you look at the photos online. Lots of money was spent on these spaces. Many of the pieces catalogued and/or an early partnership with West Elm resulted in the spaces having this clean modern look. 

In the early years of sonder the company was very much so a startup culture. Company outings. Swag for employees.  Snacks. Sending employees to different Sonder cities. Money was being made and money was being spent. 

Housekeeping was not in-house. It was typically a third party company. Another financial constraint. If you’re paying $60 per clean to a third party company but charging $120 a night that leaves $60 for: salaries, rent payments, utility bills, supply ordering, insert here, insert here, insert here expenses. The math does not add up to anything except being greatly in the red. 

Customer service was outsourced to the Philippines. Whenever you call/ text/ email/ send a chat you are 7/10 times speaking with them.. however if you were lucky , you would encounter a city staff member on text/chat /email assuming they had the time to answer those reachouts. 

Leaders.. more on that below

**Staffing** 

Back to the idea of start up culture and traditional hospitality:, tech people focus on tech things, while hospitality people focus on hospitality. A tech person knows nothing of customer service in the way that a hospitality person does and vice versa. To enter the hotel industry with a tech mindset is a disaster because the most important factor is overlooked: the customer. 

Which leads us to staffing. Sonder tended to hire non hospitality people to run their cities. Perhaps even corporate levels. If the leaders of the city do not come from hotels, but from a tech etc..background, what do they know about providing good hospitality and customer service to hotel guests? If top leadership does not come from the hotel industry what do they know about leading a hotel company? No matter how Sonder painted itself at the end of the day it was a hotel. The people in charge should come from that background. 

This lead to catastrophe for the guests. Managers who were more concerned with numbers instead of the guest experience. Managers who actively delayed and ignored solving guest issues and having face to face discussions with customers and their employees.  Managers who knew nothing of maintaining the properties they were tasked with running. Failures of building and unit upkeep which no one took control of and yet everyone else was blamed. 

Perhaps this failure of city leadership stems from the fact that Sonder did not offer traditional HR.. the HR of Sonder was an unknown entity that employees submit an online form to get answers. There was no onsite HR representation in the cities… No one the employees could go to for help or to share concerns in person… hourly employees did not know who their city assigned HR representative was. They would only submit this online form and get an answer later.  Usually for a different person each time. 

By not having a corporate hr rep in each city keeping track and maintaining oversight it allowed management teams in the city to close ranks and run their own ecosystems based on their own preferences and rules.  As a result equal treatment was not distributed amongst employees. Especially if you weren’t a favorite. Special consideration while never outright admitted, was given to those with family members and relationships on-site. Nepotism existed, convenient hirings/promotions  existed. There’s only so much an employee can do if you are not favored/dating someone important/related to someone important if you wanted to grow your within your individual sonder city. 

This lack of oversight and professionalism was astounding. The only potential oversight was in the form of an every so often “anonymous” peakon survey where employees could share honest opinions. Except they weren’t anonymous. Every employee was assigned  under a supervisor/manager. If there were not enough employees assigned under a supervisor, it was very easy for that leader to then figure out who said what about them.  Promises of change always would come with these surveys but no changes would occur. 

Hourly employees wished corporate would swoop in and take control or send HR to interview and clean things up.. but neither occurred. 

Leaders maintained unrealistic expectations on their hourly staff. They gaslit them. Roles were not clearly defined. Even roles publicly listed online were flexible and often times a singular hourly staff member would take on the responsibilities of 2-3 jobs. Managers of course were always conveniently too busy spending hours a day closed off in “meetings”. Meetings to get coffee together. Meetings to get lunch together. And actual meetings. No desk presence from managers. No manager presence when guest conflicts arose. Managers treated the job like a 9-5. Many lit the door by 5pm. Except the problem with that is hotels are 24 hour operations. Naturally all problems and conflict sometimes dangerous conflict resolution fell to hourly staff after hours. . What sonder failed to realize is the most important person is the guest. They are not just a number on a balance sheet. They are a real human being spending real money to stay. They should always have been the first and main priority. The next greatest priority is the hourly staff. Train them, support them, uplift them and you will see success. That did not cure here and anyone can look at the reviews on Glassdoor and other review sites to see how Sonder leaders ran their teams. 

**Guest experience** 

Sonder was a hotbed for prostitution. The concept was perfect… barely present staff especially in buildings with no front desk… Apartment style accommodations… And codes to enter.. prostitutes and their clients were a common feature at Sonders. The girls were typically international, from central/South America  and traveled in groups renting for a week or two at a time. Occasionally they had a “pimp” with them typically in the form of a boyfriend. Clients would come and go using their codes.  

Underage guests were also an issue. Sonder was originally a Canadian company. The age to rent a space was 18 and up. As you can imagine that can result in problematic stays. Out of control parties. 18 year olds bringing in younger people to their rooms. Sonder should have been a 21+ hotel company. 

Drug use was rampant in the rooms. Weed was a common smell. 

Bedbugs. Or in Sonder terminology “jellybeans” were an unfortunate reality as well.  Though this is not Sonder specific.. but was of course another added cost to remedy. 

Homeless/ mentally ill visitors. Sonder properties were in central locations in major cities. Often times in neighborhoods with nightlife and heavy foot traffic. This brought growing numbers of homeless individuals around building entrances and even at times within the building itself.. leaving you guessed it.. hourly staff to handle removal if security was not on-site and managers were already home.  

The rooms were overused and poorly maintained. They photograph beautifully but when you look more closely the age and overuse shows. This could be helped with proper maintenance but like the prior leadership mentions, the property management team was also ill equipped or wrongly hired to perform the job. So eventually the units and buildings fell into disarray. 

**Marriott**

Marriott. What did they know? When the deal was announced Marriott had 1.5 million rooms on offer. Sonder had under 10,000. What kind of partnership could this have been. What say did Sonder have to anything. 

The only benefit sonder employees had was the ability to stay 5 times a year up to 3 days at a time for $50 or the cleaning fee at sonder properties. This was taken away upon Marriott taking over. The Marriott employee travel system is a lie. The promise of discount rates at all Marriott brands yet they never exist when searching for them. How do you go from letting your employees stay for 3 days for $50 to paying $80-300 per night depending on the brand but having that discount never appear as available when searching. 

Did Marriott do their due diligence before entering this arrangement?  Or do they just gobble up as much as they can to maintain dominance.

it was amazing learning how fraudulent the Bonvoy system is. so often you would get platinum/titanium guests that had no money and who’s stays were unpaid. Many times never showing up. Do bonvoy members get status growth by just booking and not staying? Or booking and not paying? Do they book list to hold a room and never use it? Are they ploys to get credits and points? 

Often these were Marriott employees or friends of Marriott employees that builtup their status. Does Marriott not audit or keep track of their members? Is it not odd that you have employees or friends of employees at platinum/titanium level.. when do they have time to travel 50/75 nights a year and still be employed full time to obtain/maintain  that status. When Sonder went live in May countless Marriott employees stayed whose credit cards later failed. As if they knew to take advantage of the system. 

 You could always tell when a “real” Marriott bonvoy was staying. It was clear they legitimately earned their status. The prostitutes surprisingly or unsurprisingly enough were high level bonvoy members. Probably due to their frequent travel.  Though some stayed under employee rates which was confusing. 

Speaking of. How could Marriott push Sonder to their Bonvoy elites knowing that Sonder is not a traditional hotel model. Marriott guests familiar with and expecting a certain hotel experience were left with being locked out of buildings .. confused by or unwilling to verify online, and unimpressed with the rooms and amenity offerings. The only Bonvoy elites that’s seemed to mesh with the Sonder model were business travelers who enjoyed the apartment style having a kitchen/laundry in the space to use rather than just a bed like typical hotels. Marriott set their most loyal customers up for failure by not clearly and loudly advising exactly what Sonder was and wasn’t.

So what was the endgame for Marriott. Did they go in knowing Sonder was going to fail. 

Did they do this to be able to claim a big fat tax write off at the end of the year. Did they legitimately try to grow/ let the brand prosper. 

Sonder almost got delisted from Nasdaq multiple times. Its financial issues and mass layoffs were not new information. All of this was public knowledge. Did Marriott enter not knowing this or did they not care Anyone’s guess. 

And how it ended. For such a behemoth of a company that drills the importance of its bonvoy service onto staff.. to then throw their most loyal out on the streets with no answers, not relocating or rebooking them price matched to the dozens of affiliate properties it has per city is catastrophic. Marriott removed financial and booking control from Sonder. All payments went through Marriotts Opera software system and stripe. it’s crazy how Sonder, a blip sizewise when it comes to Marriott has now resulted in Marriott facing major negative brand PR and loss of trust amongst its most loyal",0,1763283314.0,hotels,0,0.5,False

For me:

* Mechanical keyboards are probably the most direct comparison. Endless customization options (for sound, feel, and aesthetics) and stuff to tinker with (manually lubing switches, keyboard mods, frankenswitches, etc). 

* I'm casually into fountain pens. I got to build a custom one in Japan, and messing with inks/nibs is kinda fun. 

* Just got my first hobbyist/enthusiast flashlight and downsized it to a smaller tube. 

* OS optimization - I've tinkered with Windows a bit to get it to the point I'm satisfied. I keep my desktop clean and icon-less. I made the taskbar vertical and transparent with a custom start button. I've improved efficiency with AutoHotKey scripts. And I appreciate modular software like foobar2000. 

* I write custom stylesheets for websites and Firefox's browser UI. Takes a lot of experimentation and trial and error, kinda like building SFF. 

* I like Mazda Miatas a lot (but don't own one... yet).

* Manual coffee brewing - messing with various techniques, recipes, and methods is fun.

* I enjoy strategic board/card games that require you to optimize an engine, combinations of things, or the use of limited resources.

* Home theater - learning a bit about sound, speakers, acoustics, etc when selecting parts/arrangements for my living room.",0,1763283104.0,sffpc,4,0.33,False

November in Kolkata is hitting different this year, because wdym it's 12 noon and I'm sitting with my fan closed? I thought this happened only in late December here. Anyways, checking out my winter frag collection, I realised I only own a few TF decants (noir de noir, noir extreme, Black Orchid) and apart from them, all of them are ME. 

And here's a short review for few of those!

(Although I'd suggest not to consider these reviews as set in stone, cause 

1. Perfumes are subjective
2. My whole winter collection is of decants and partials because.. oh well, we don't get a lot of winter here)

1. Khamrah OG : probably one of the most hyped frags ever and imo worth it. Has a boozy cinnamon+dates opening with cozy background of nutmeg. Stays for ridiculously long time, projects around 2 feet (I ain't joking, girls stop and ask me what I'm wearing). Not very unisex imo, leans sweet and stays sweet, has a sexy overall vibe to it (imagine wearing a dark coloured pashmina shawl over a red salwar suit with a side braid and kohl eyes, enjoying a decadent wedding)

2. Angham : Again, everyone and their mothers have heard about her, she's THAT girl. While her fraternal twin Goddess works for all season with her airy appeal, gingery and warm Angham says she likes working when the mercury dips below 25°C. Lol, I have been wearing this almost everyday since Diwali, she's very ""kadak chai"" to my nose, reminds me of our hanuman da tea stall right outside the hospital where we go to clear out head (yes it smells very gingery warm vanilla to me). Yesterday a colleague asked me what I was wearing and she went ""it smells so good, I keep smelling you"". Again a very strong perfume so I can't apply more than 2 spray because I work in hospital, and not everyone would want to smell madam ginger vanilla waltzing around when they are in pain. 

3. Zimaya coco tiramisu : classic sweet cute gourmand, doesn't last very long on me, don't get the coffee part of tiramisu, I smell sweet vanilla with ice cream in a cozy delicious way. Am a non-gourmand girl but she is inoffensive and sweet and mild. 

4. Qissa Delicious : airy, whipped cream, sweet, fluffy without being overtly ""edible"" thanks to the orange note balancing the cupcakey vibe. Lasts for decent time and good for cute outings and dates

5. Afnan 9pm : unisex, heavy fruity fragrance which is also very sweet to my nose, is playful on men and sexy on  women. Lasts ridiculously long lol

6. Badee al oud amethyst : roses, amber, spices and oud. Heavy, dark and spicy, anything with oud makes me feel like it's ""femme fatale"" and badee al oud SERVES. But it can get very strong and suffocating, so it's only reserved for winter date nights or literally places which would fit the atmosphere of a heavy frag like this one.

Imagine me sitting on the grass, tired and helpless. Then I saw in my peripheral view that someone was approaching. Si A 😳  may dalang camping chair and bottled water. Paiyak na ako sa inis kasi feeling ko hindi ko mabubuo yung tent bago dumating sila kuya. I look at him with puppy eyes naawa siguro kaya help nya ako makatayo. Infairness ang bango nya clean, fresh and tangy scent. Naka white plain shirt and khaki  short na until tuhod, white cap and sporty shade.


Pinaupo  nya ako sa camping chair and inabutan ng water. Ganda ng ngiti nya eh, yung ngiting mapang-asar. Sabi pa sakin nilapitan na kita baka umiyak ka na eh. He ask kung nag breakfast na ako I said not yet. Umalis sya sandali,  pagbalik nya may dala syang  portable fan, croissants  at  Auto-air pump.

Inabot nya sakin yung bread at tinutok sakin yung fan. Naisip ko aay wow! ready mukhang camper talaga.   10 mins lang na set-up na yung tent gamit yun Automatic air pump. Nag thank you ako sa kanya and he jokingly told me. Unblock mo na ako add friend mo na din please. I said okay, i unblock him na ngiting ngiti ang kuya mo A. He said tinanong pala kita kay Coach E hindi ka pa daw ulit bumabalik doon. Tinataguan mo ata ako e. Sabi ko hindi naman busy lang talaga kaya home workout muna ako.

Na stop yung paguusap namin kasi dumating na parents  ko, A said hello to them. Tapos yung kuya ko na may Birthday they shake hands and tinapik sa balikan na para bang matagal na silang magkakilala. A even said Advance happy birthday bro! Pinakilala sa parents ko and kuya said kilala mo naman na si E diba? my youngest sister. A just smile  at me na parang nang-aasar tinuturo yung phone ko.

Nagpaalam na sya  na babalik na sa tent nila, kanya pala yung ford explorer sa unahan. Jusko pooo inang kitang kita pala talaga yung struggle ko kanina.bigla akong nahiya iniisip ko anong itsura ko kanina. 🤣🤭tinawag nya ako sa nickname ko. I was shocked term of endearment sakin ng mga kapatid ko yun. Kaya nilakihan ko sya ng mata. He just wink at me and tatawa-tawang umalis waving pa. Until tomorrow ba kami dito nila kuya, pero mga parents ko around 6PM uuwi na. Update ko ulit kayo kung may ibang ganap pa mamaya.😊

1oygmi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1oygmi8/i_paid_an_18k_bill_to_avoid_a_scene_i_thought_i/,I paid an ₹18k bill to avoid a scene. I thought I was being a gentleman; she was just securing her bag. (A Lesson on the Koramangala Pub Scam),"I’ve been in Bangalore for a while, but my life is strictly Office-to-Home. I have zero connections here outside of work. Loneliness makes you blind, and I admit, I was blind.

I matched with a girl on Tinder. She insisted on meeting **that very evening**. She bypassed coffee shops and picked a specific club in Koramangala.

**The Psychology of the Scam** I want to be clear: **I was not unaware of the prices.** I am a teetotaler (I don't drink or smoke). When she ordered a pack of cigarettes, I saw the bill: **₹800** (for a pack with a market price of ₹300). When she ordered round after round of alcohol, I saw the total climbing. I *knew* I was being overcharged.

But we were in a crowded public place. I had two choices:

1. Argue, create a ""drama,"" and look like a ""cheap"" guy in front of everyone.
2. Pay the bill, maintain my dignity, and leave quietly.

I chose the second option. I paid the **₹18,000** bill with my credit card because I didn't want to create a scene. I valued my peace over the money.

**The Twist (The Financial Trap)** After I went home, she messaged me saying she was in severe pain (periods) and needed something ordered urgently. She asked for my credit card details again. Because I am a decent person trying to help someone in pain, I helped. I gave the OTP. **But then she asked again for more money.** That’s when the fog lifted. I realized: **My decency was being treated as stupidity.** I refused further payments.

**The Proof it was a Scam** The moment I said ""No"" to more money, she **Unmatched me on Tinder immediately**. She did this so I couldn't report her profile or warn others. She tried to scrub her tracks on the app to protect her ""hunting ground,"" but she forgot she is still connected on my WhatsApp.

**My Hard-Learned Lessons for You:**

* **The ""Same Evening"" Rush:** If they insist on meeting immediately and won't do a simple coffee date first, it's a trap.
* **The ""Sharam"" Factor:** Scammers rely on your shame. They know you won't fight over a bill in a fancy club. Please, don't be like me. It is better to look ""cheap"" for 5 minutes than to lose ₹18k to someone who doesn't care about you.
* **The Unmatch:** If she unmatches you the second the money stops flowing, it was never a date. It was a robbery.

**To the Girl:** I didn't pay that bill because I was a fool. I paid it because I respect public decorum. You took advantage of a guy who was lonely and trying to be a gentleman. You got your free drinks, but you lost a person who would have stood by you when you were actually in pain



**Important disclaimer:** I’m not sharing this for sympathy or empathy. I know I made a mistake, and I accept that it can’t be undone. But what happened should not be repeated by anyone else.

The good thing about mistakes is that others can learn from them. So I’m sharing this as a learning for **everyone — boys and girls**. I’m not blaming any gender, and I don’t want this to sound like a gender-based warning. This is simply a reminder for all of us to stay aware, protect ourselves, and make wise decisions when meeting new people, especially in a new city.

Take this as a general life lesson:

I'd been with Yannis Lewis my entire life. I bore him children, raised them, and stayed by his side until the day he died—and yet he never even gave me a wedding.

After he passed, I found a photo hidden in his wallet and realized he had always been in love with his first love, Cherry Goodman.

At seventy, I ended my own life with sleeping pills. My two sons watched me writhe in the sun shower, unfazed.

Once I was dead, they had me cremated right away. They didn't even keep the urn—just flushed my ashes down the crematorium drain.

And my belongings were tossed out like trash.

But fate had other plans. I woke up again—on the very day Cherry arrived at our door with her daughter.

Yannis and my two sons ganged up on me, screaming about how heartless I was for not taking them in.

I pulled out the divorce papers and walked out of that house without looking back.

The ironic thing was, after I left, they fell apart.

*****

""Because of you, Cherry is still in the hospital. I don't want a cold-hearted woman like you for a mom,"" screamed Yosef, my younger son.

""Yosef, why are you even talking to that witch? Dad's here. Hang up and come eat,"" Adrian, my other son, said, his young voice sharp with contempt.

I listened to the beeping on the phone and stared at myself in the mirror for a long time before it hit me—I'd traveled back in time.

I was 27 again, and it was the third day since Cherry had come to our house with her daughter, Yvonne Sinclair.

Cherry was Yannis's true love.

She'd vanished from Jecriton for seven years without a word. Then, just two days ago, she suddenly came back to Yannis—beaten up, with Yvonne in tow.

Yannis wanted to take her to the hospital, but she refused. With no other options, he let her move in—didn't even bother to ask me.

I was afraid of Yannis, and honestly, I felt bad for Cherry, seeing her all hurt like that. So I kept my mouth shut.

But when I came back from hand-washing Yannis and my sons' clothes, I found Cherry lying in my marital bed. And her daughter even called me stupid right to my face.

*****

I was the heiress of the Jones Group, and Yannis was raised to be my childhood husband.

My mom got really sick while she was pregnant with me, so I was born premature—and a bit slower than most people mentally.

When Mom was alive, she patiently taught me how to express myself. But Yannis never liked hearing me talk; every time I opened my mouth, I could see the annoyance in his eyes. So I learned to keep quiet when he was around.

After Mom passed away, Yannis became even less interested in listening to me.

Eventually, I forgot how to even talk to him. Whenever my emotions boiled over, all I could do was throw a fit and make a scene.

That day, I completely lost control. I snapped and kicked Cherry and Yvonne out of the house.

Yannis said I was being impossible and stormed off with the mother-daughter duo. He still hadn't come back since then, and neither had Adrian and Yosef.

Today was our seventh wedding anniversary.

In my previous life, I cooked up a whole table of the three Lewises' favorite dishes, hoping to call them home and maybe patch things up.

But my sons' words cut me so deep I lost focus, stumbled, and ended up cracking my head open.

Back then, I just couldn't figure out why the kids I carried for nine months and raised with all my heart wouldn't even call me ""Mom,"" but could so easily call someone they'd only known for three days ""Godmother Cherry.""

Now I get it—rotten roots only grow rotten branches.

It wasn't until after Yannis died that I realized Cherry was his first love, and even Yvonne turned out to be his kid.

Because I was born a little slow, Mom'd always felt guilty about me. After Dad died in a car accident, she went to an orphanage and adopted Yannis, terrified I'd get taken advantage of once she was gone.

She had planned to look for someone to help me out. But when she saw how talented Yannis was, she changed her mind. She decided to groom him to be my future husband instead.

Mom always said Yannis would be my husband, my one real shot at survival. She told me to hang out with him more, and try and bond with him.

I listened, following Yannis everywhere.

Yannis was a genius, fast-tracked through an elite program. From a young age, he started helping my mom run the Jones Group.

Cherry was his childhood sweetheart from the orphanage. After joining the Jones Group, he pulled some strings to make her his secretary, and then they started hooking up—right under my and Mom's noses.

Yannis hated me for coming between him and Cherry.

I'd never forget the way he looked at me right before he died.

He'd always been cold and distant with me. But in that final moment, even someone as slow as me could feel the pure hatred in his eyes.

""Lilian Jones,"" he said. ""I always wanted to treat you like a sister. But you kept me apart from my true love for years. Because of you, I could never go back to my real home. I hope you burn in hell after I die.""

Back then, I was too naive to get what he meant. To me, we were married, so of course we were supposed to be each other's true love, and our home was supposed to be ours together.

Then, I discovered a photo of Cherry in his wallet. While I was still drowning in grief over losing him, she kicked me out of my house. What was worse, I found he'd willed everything we owned to Yvonne.

That was when it hit me: he'd always loved Cherry. And his revenge had started the moment she left.

Before my mom passed, he'd followed her wishes and married me, promising he'd take care of me forever.

Then he sweet-talked me into having one kid after another, so I'd be too busy with the kids to care about anything else, especially the company.

I never had a clue when he changed the company's ownership or shifted all our assets elsewhere.

After he died, I did go through hell, just like he wanted.

But as for his claim that I tore him and Cherry apart, I honestly had no idea what he meant.

Yannis was two years older than me. While he was helping my mom run the company, I was just a student.

I only met Cherry once—by accident—when I went to see Yannis at work.

Back then, I honestly thought Cherry was even clumsier than I was. She'd burn her hand just making coffee for Yannis, and walked straight into his arms like she tripped over thin air.

Since I learned to walk, I had never tripped again. And when it came to making coffee, my hands were always steady.

I just couldn't wrap my head around it—we were both kind of slow and clumsy, so why did Yannis treat Cherry like she was something fragile, while he was constantly irritated with me?

I told Mom about my doubts. Yannis probably didn't like me either, like everyone else did.

Mom reassured me it was nothing and told me not to overthink it. After that, I never saw Cherry again.

Not until she showed up three days ago.

With Yannis still hanging up on her and her clearly not over him, it was only a matter of time before their old flame reignited.

Honestly, it’s impossible to put into words the feelings you get when communicating at a distance or in person. With yours, whether he is your friend or a good acquaintance whom you met by chance but you communicate with him for a long time, these emotions are quite normal in communication, even during a fun event that you prepared especially for for a walk, but having learned about the same person only his name, age and the person himself on the outside, my whole brain is already filled with emotions and a thirst for communication and Friendship, And the point is not in the events around, but in the fact that the person is a member of a secret society and it’s not that he is a person higher in level than all the most famous respected characters, but he is the same At first glance, he's like that friend with whom you don't get enough even from the simulated events during a walk. He himself is different in nature from other friends and long-time acquaintances, just standing in front of you without realizing that he is in a secret and this should give you stronger emotions than from an ordinary person.After getting to know him a little as a person, the difference is even stronger, but already in a serious awareness,His difference from other people is heaven and earth, I immediately had a conscious thought about him, why is he a man of a secret society without knowing his secret and without asking how he lives, what is possible is engaged in,After 5 minutes, another thought came to mind: to find out this is because the emotions and awareness of it just upon meeting were already at such a level that it cannot be compared with anything, as it is impossible during a normal meeting or a walk.To receive such emotions, After a cup of coffee, washed down with plain water, it was espresso, he suggested eating the food that he eats, from which you immediately understand that he is someone who is simply not known and not to get acquainted. Further on, everything is more to the point, everything is at the highest level, almost everything that I heard about is all new and unfamiliar even for those very show business stars, I mean that each of us has equipment and so on. Similar As for clarifications, I will never say, because at the very least, it will not be found for people who are not related to this, There are a lot of things I didn't even know As for his life and how he conducts it, I cannot say, since even I do not know how to reveal this, no one will ever be able to do so or let anyone know, this is a principle and  rule which is the law

In the next post I will focus more on the person's information in secret and even one of his small nails makes itself known...

So to explain a bit. I am a bit paranoid whenever it comes to my lungs. 

I have bad asthma, spontaneous pneumothoraxes and had a right side lung operation last year. 

This morning i made a cup of coffee and i sad down and took a sip. I swallowed the mouth full down and felt that instant choking sensation so i spit the left over fluid in my mouth out and coughed a few times. While my husband tapped my back lightly 
I instantly worried that the whole mouth full i swallowed went in to my lungs. 

I did not have that usual feeling when you instantly choke to the point where you can barely take a breath and cough violently. 

I coughed a few times and then just felt like a bit of fluid comes up and lays in my throat. In the last 30 min since it happened i keep occasionally getting a cough and what feels like drops in my throat that almost irritates it, like a tickle. My voice is a bit horse  and i keep clearing my throat almost also like i have alot of plegm in my throat type of feel. I feel a bit short of breath and used my astravent and dis a few breathing exercises. 

Will i know if the full mouth full went down my throat? 
Can it all go down and cause delayed drowning?

1oygfbr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oygfbr,Characters' nerdiness is only hinted rather than a defining trait,"Something a lot of nerd culture lacks in the modern day is subtlety. It feels like nowadays, if a character is into something, they beat you over the head with that trait. *Insert Big Bang Theory is bad joker here*

But there are times when a character's love of some pop culture thing is only glanced over or briefly referenced, giving them character depth without needing to force it down your throat.

Clark's Tasmanian Devil Mug and Blackhawk's Jersey (Christmas Vacation): Clark is a nerdy character trying to be a stereotypical old fashioned dad. You see his nostalgia for his childhood Christmases, wanting to bring that to his family, and his attempts at being a handyman that end in bodily harm and abject failure. In truth, Clark is a pointdexter. He's a chemical engineer who designs preservatives for food. Astute, but clueless and doofy, and I think it's exemplified in his choice of coffee mug. Taz. All these stiff shirts around him, and he drinks coffee out of a Looney Toon. It also reflects his love of cartoons in general, considering the great lengths he went through to get his family to Wally World. And instead of a stereotypical dad sport like baseball or football, his Jersey is from a hockey team. While that's probably more of a reflection of the director's love of Chicago, it reads to me that either Clark doesn't really understand sports and just chose one at random, or he really does enjoy dudes beating the shit out of each other on ice (appropriate).

Jerry's Superman Statue (Seinfeld): Jerry's apartment is one of the most iconic places in television, and part of that iconic set is our boy, Clark Kent positioned between his VHS tapes. Never referenced, never insulted or complimented, it's just there. A perfect way to showcase that Jerry's a comic nerd without him pouring over comics like a bad Patton Oswalt bit.

House worships Arceus (House MD): Little more on the nose than the others, but House for as ridiculous as it is, can be kinda clever. In one episode, House makes a passing reference to Arceus, in a time when Arceus was still brand new to Pokemon. It's just a fun nod that House likes him some DS.",1,1763281528.0,TopCharacterTropes,1,0.57,False
1oygeti,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oygeti/waiting_on_a_girl_to_confirm_our_next_dateam_i/,Waiting on a girl to confirm our next date—Am I being impatient?,"I matched with a girl on a dating app about two weeks ago. She was very chatty and the vibe was good. She mentioned she’d recently had bad experiences with guys ghosting her and messing her around, and that she was looking for someone who communicates respectfully and is straightforward. I told her I was looking for the same.

After a few days, she asked for my number and we switched to texting. Not long after, she invited me out for coffee. The date went well, and at the end she asked if I wanted to see her again—I said yes. I followed up later that evening via text to say I’d enjoyed the date and wanted to see her again, and she responded the same. We even agreed we’d be honest with each other if either of us changed our minds.

After two days without texting, I initiated a conversation and she responded quickly. Eventually, I asked if she had any ideas for our next date. She suggested I come to her place for dinner and a movie, which I agreed to. She proposed a date two weeks out but said she needed to check with her flatmate, though it “would probably be fine” and she’d let me know.

It’s been four days since then, and I haven’t heard from her at all. I’m unsure whether I’m just being impatient, since the date is still over a week away, or if this silence is a sign she’s not that interested.

I’m weighing a few options and would appreciate advice:

A. Text her today with something general and see if she responds or mentions the date.

B. Text her directly asking if she confirmed the date with her flatmate. (I worry this might seem impatient and needy as it could be too soon.)

C. Wait until a day or two before the proposed date and ask then. (Seems reasonable, but her lack of follow-up and me needing to chase raises a red flag)

D. Don’t text at all and wait to see if she contacts me. If the date passes without a response, I delete her number and move on.

I think the thing that confuses me the most is that she said she wanted respectful and straightforward communication due to her recent bad experiences with guys ghosting her etc but is possibly about to do the exact same thing to me, which would be a massive double standard.",1,1763281476.0,dating_advice,9,1.0,False

If there are no free meals- look. I say this EXACTLY- because mothers with children come to your church. It’s not an expectation. But you also run a food a drive and have to meet a criteria.

What criteria? Please- tell me. Any of y’all.

Nah. I’m a Christian. And I don’t like these churches. They are selective. 

Snap shut down after I got off it. Then I got fired. No. I’m tired. Church is between two people. I don’t care anymore. Keep your songs. I make my own to God.

You have a whole congregation. Sandwich shop. Maybe even gift shop.

Free coffee- nice.

Free sandwich? Same cost. 

If you are selling- and you don’t have a sign that says “food to the needy, missions are a plus”

I’m coming to Berlin for a week soon with the idea of exploring the city properly, checking out different neighborhoods, getting a feel for the vibe, and seeing what life here *actually* feels like these days. I’m considering making the move next year.

Would be down to meet like-minded people while I’m around, coffee, beer, a walk, whatever. Always nice to chat with people who live here and hear your take on the city.

A little about me: I’m Dutch, work in tech and trade stocks, and I’m thinking of starting a new business next year. Things I love; working out, yoga, cooking, design, architecture, philosophy, exploring cities on foot, and above all, good conversations.

If you’re around and want to link up or share your thoughts on living in Berlin, feel free to send a DM. Looking forward to soaking up the city again! Oh, and any recommendations are also most welcome.",0,1763281299.0,berlinsocialclub,5,0.2,False

1oygcnr,https://i.redd.it/5gbboorgwk1g1.jpeg,Reborn - Enjoying a cup of pour-over,"Today I’ve enjoyed pour-over for the first time since I started specialty coffee last September. I am usually more of an espresso guy (Cafelat Robot, Picopresso, OXO Rapid Brewer), and in the beginning when I started, I was a lot questioning my taste abilities since I couldn’t get much all the flavours of the coffee beans I used to buy back then. And I always saw videos of people and influencers enjoying both espresso AND filter coffee, and they always seemed to find their filtered coffee very very tasty. Same as the people of this sub. I was very curious. So, I got myself a Hario Switch to try filter coffee, thinking that I would be able to get all those flavours and tasty notes that everyone was speaking about, and that I couldn’t get much neither from my first espressos.
I must say that I was very disappointed when I tried filter the first few tries. I didn’t like that sort of tea-like watery drink that tasted a bit like coffee but it was very blunt and all the flavours were very muted. I really didn’t like that at all. I used to grind with the K6 around 90-100-120 clicks as recommended in the specs. I was disappointed, because I believed back then that my palate was just not developed enough to fully enjoy and detect all the subtile notes of the coffee. Like Sting feeling like an alien in his song, I was feeling like a stranger amongst all the coffee enthusiasts, an odd one, incapable of enjoying what most people like the most — well, here 😉! It was very frustrating, and it felt like a conspiracy, you know. I kept trying from time to time, but I never really enjoyed any of the cups I got from it.

Time passed… I’ve got more used to my equipments, and my K6. And a couple of days ago I read a sub where people were grinding their K6 a bit finer for pour over around 80-85 clicks, with a specific temperature. Coincidently, I received 2 weeks ago a series of DAK coffee that I ordered, which resting period just finished. They are espresso omni-roast, but I thought that I would give them a chance with the Switch. I also prepare my own water now, so I was in better conditions to give it another try.

I used the 50/50 recipe for the Switch. And I drank the first sip.

Hooo-Myyyy-God!! It was one of those Hooray moments! I suddenly got all the flavours of the beans, I could taste very clearly the Cardamome, the vanilla cake, the pistachio, all of those popping in my mouth like fireworks. Well, I am exaggerating a bit, but it was really like a revelation, and I finally understood all of you guys so crazy about your filter coffee!!
I was finally alive. Or was I dying instead? I could see flashing back before my eyes the memories of all the videos about clarity, fruity notes, and so on. I understand. “I FINALLY UNDERSTAAAAND!!"" ""🎶Wooo O, 🎵 I’m no alien… 🎶 I’m really no alien…”.
If I’m going crazy, then I’m definitely not dying 😅.  What a great feeling that was. And that was only using an espresso roast. I can’t imagine with a Filter roast what it will be like (hooo yeah it ""will"" be!)

Haaa… I would like to thank all the community for all the advice given in all the subs, you contributed to bring a bit more light and happiness in my life today!

I got off the roller coaster 8 weeks ago. I just, couldn't do it anymore. The inconsistency of the medicine was taking over my life. Everyday I was waking up and structuring my entire day around getting my Adderall to work effectively. It was exhausting, so I stopped. I was up to 55 mg a day and I did cold turkey it. I don't recommend that. But you know what? I feel really good now. I'm not going to lie, my life did kinda fall apart for the first few weeks, but I did begin to stabilize. I can motivate myself to tidy up my house and I feel excited to do things like have a cup of coffee. I was so afraid I wouldnt ever feel ok without meds.

None of them hers.

Morning begins before the sun has the decency to rise. Cold tatami under bare feet.  
The kind of cold that sits in the bones and makes them hum.

Rin Watanabe doesn't hum. Not when she's awake. Only on stage.  
And maybe just maybe in the shower, when she forgets she's *Rin Watanabe*.

January 12, 2015.  
Day off. Supposedly.

Her manager had said, *""You've earned it, Rin-chan. Stay home, relax.""*  
She believed him. Idiot.

The phone buzzes.  
The ugly buzz ,the kind that means bad news or worse, fan gossip.

Three messages from Kana in wardrobe.  
One from an unknown number.  
All saying the same thing, different flavors:

*Is this you?*  
*Did you really say that?*  
*Wtf Rin.*

Her stomach tightens. She scrolls.

There it is.  
A photo.

Her.  
Except... not.

The face is almost right, but the eyeliner's too heavy, the jaw slightly wrong if you tilt your head and actually *look*.

She's wearing Rin's Stage 4 Winter Tour jacket.  
Custom gold embroidery. One of a kind.  
As far as Rin knew, there was only one in existence.  
Hers.

The girl in the photo walks out of a convenience store in Ikebukuro, holding a canned coffee and a pack of cigarettes.

Rin doesn't smoke.  
She hates coffee.

The internet doesn't care.  
The tags are already bad: **#rinwatanabe #idolfallfromgrace #smokingidol #trashyqueen**

Rin sits on the edge of her futon, staring at the photo like it's a puzzle she could solve if she just turned her head the right way.  
There's a taste in her mouth like aluminum.

By ten a.m., the agency knows.  
By 10:15, her manager is calling.  
By 10:16, she's ignoring him.

She opens the curtains instead.  
The winter sun is thin and white, like it's been washed too many times.  
Tokyo sprawls beyond her window, concrete and steam, crows laughing at something only crows find funny.

She zooms in on the photo.  
The girl's smile is small, private like she knows a secret Rin doesn't.  
Rin hates it because she recognizes it.

It's *hers*.  
Her *Stage 5 ending pose* smile.

How does someone *steal* that?

Her phone rings again. She answers this time.

""Where are you?""  
""Home.""  
""Stay there. Don't go outside. We're... handling it.""

Handling it.  
Agency-speak for *We have no idea what's happening but we'll yell at a few interns until it looks like we're doing something.*

By noon, Rin breaks. She calls Kana.

Kana's voice is a low, hurried rush, like she's whispering behind a locked door.

""I swear to god, Rin, she looks exactly like you. I saw her yesterday at Shibuya crossing. Thought it was you until she looked me dead in the eye and walked away.""

""Could it be a fan?""

""Maybe. But fans don't get costumes from our department. That jacket is *yours*, right?""

Rin doesn't answer.

Because here's the thing: that jacket hadn't been in her closet last week.  
She'd assumed laundry.  
Or dry cleaning.  
Or some staff mix-up.  
It happens all the time.

Except maybe this time, it didn't just *happen*.

She tries to eat lunch.  
Fails.  
The miso soup goes cold.

Instead, she opens her laptop.  
Searches her own name like a masochist.

Scrolling.  
Scrolling.

Tweets. Threads.  
Paparazzi shots, blurry and cruel.

Someone's already made a *Spot the Fake Rin* compilation:  
Three photos. Two real, one impostor.  
The comments fight like it's a game show.

She slams the laptop shut.

Her apartment feels wrong now.  
Like maybe *she's* the fake one.  
Like maybe the real Rin Watanabe is out there somewhere, wearing her clothes, holding her smile, walking through the January cold like she owns it.

By two p.m., she can't stay inside anymore.

Coat. Scarf. Mask. Sunglasses.  
She could be anyone.  
She decides to be *anyone*.

Ikebukuro first.  
Maybe because that's where the photo was taken.  
Maybe because if she doesn't go, she'll feel like she's hiding.

The streets smell of fried chicken and exhaust.  
Kids in oversized coats.  
Vending machines buzzing.

She finds the convenience store.  
Same orange sign.  
Same crooked oden poster in the window.

No fake Rin.

At 3:15, she sits in a café, steam fogging the glass.  
Her tea goes untouched.

Maybe the impostor is somewhere nearby, drinking actual coffee and laughing about all this chaos.  
Maybe they'd look exactly alike, sitting side by side, alone in their own ways.

Her phone buzzes.  
A text from an unknown number:

*Nice coat.*

Rin looks up.

There she is.  
Three tables over.

Same face.  
Same hair, even down to the stubborn fringe that never sits right unless you tilt your head.

But the eyes different.  
Amused. Like she's been *waiting*.

The fake Rin raises her cup in a silent toast.

Rin doesn't remember leaving the café.  
Only that she's outside, walking too fast, past pachinko parlors and shuttered boutiques.  
Her breath is sharp in the cold.

The phone buzzes again.

*Don't be mad. I'm just making you interesting.*

Rin wants to throw the phone into the gutter.  
She doesn't.

Back home, the city hums outside her window train lines, neon, a thousand voices not her own.

Her jacket sits on a chair.  
Her real jacket.

She stares at it like it's guilty.  
Because maybe it is.

The agency calls again.  
She lets it ring.

Rin thinks of the other girl's smile.  
Of that single terrifying moment when she couldn't tell if she was looking at herself or someone else entirely.

And she wonders:  
If someone can wear your face better than you can...  
What does that make *you*?

Outside, somewhere in the city, the fake Rin is probably laughing.  
Probably wearing something Rin hasn't noticed is missing yet.  
Probably planning the next photo.

January 12, 2015.  
Day off.  
Supposedly.

Rin closes her eyes.  
Not sure if she's going to sleep.  
Or just wait.

1oyg8ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1oyg8ks/aita_husband_and_i_had_a_fight/,AITA Husband and I had a fight,"AITA So my husband (28M) and myself (28M) were at a friend’s birthday party. We had decided not to stay too late as my husband had worked night shift the evening before and was of course very tired. Around 23:00 he said he wanted to go home. So I started to great all of the people. He then got distracted several times still hanging around, which puts me in an awkward position cause I’ve already greeted people. So I told him we have to go, can he please stop getting distracted. 

Then all of a sudden he got very angry at me. Telling me that all I ever do is scold him out for stuff whoever he tries to have fun. (It should be noted he was very tipsy at least at this point). I don’t drink at all. 

Finally get home, he just goes straight upstairs and gets into bed. I try to talk to him about why he is now upset with me. He just doesn’t want to talk. 

I got very angry at this point because I struggled at the party. I have ASD and parties are hard for me. I also came home and did the usual few minutes of hating myself for being different and not just being able to have fun like everyone else. So I was also not in a good space. 

He was still awake so I tried to talk to him again. Just saying I don’t know what I did? I don’t know why he is angry? He just shouted at me that for once could i not complain about everything?

We then went to bed, he only woke up at 14:00 the next day, seeing as he didn’t sleep much post night shift. I tried waking him up at 12:00 and then again at 14:00, both times with coffee. He eventually woke up around 15:00.

So I asked him if he is still angry at me, so I said okay. I’m sorry that we fought and went downstairs. Thinking it’s over now. After about 30 min I go back up and he is still just laying in bed on his phone. So I asked if he is coming downstairs, he said no. 

So I said then what is going on? What did I do? What is happening? He said why don’t I just leave him alone. He said I must leave him alone until he stop sticking the joy out of everything or every time he tries to have a good time. Which really hurt me and I just left. 

Later he started getting dressed and bathed, so I asked are you going out. And he said yes. I asked where are you going? (We have an arrangement, we always let each other know where we are going, and  we are safe there) He just asked why do I want to know? Then some part of the interaction that I cannot quite remember exactly, I asked something and he just said are you dumb? And that I should stop pushing him to have this conversation. 

So I asked why are you treating me like this? I don’t understand. I don’t know what is going on. And he just said he wants to. 

I know it’s best to sometimes just give him some time and space. But am I the asshole here? Or is this just starting to feel like this is not how we should treat each other in a marriage?
